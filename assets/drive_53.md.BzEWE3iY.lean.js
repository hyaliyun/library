His promises to buy off his personal assets to avoid conflicts of interest were never fulfilled, which sparked controversy throughout his terms in office. Berlusconi is a controversial figure in modern Italian politics: his tenure as Prime Minister was racked with scandalous sex affairs and poor judgement and decision-making. These events were widely covered by the media, drawing outcry from many of his Italian contemporaries and worldwide counterparts. Controversies =Economic conflicts of interest= According to journalists Marco Travaglio and Enzo Biagi, Berlusconi entered politics to save his companies from bankruptcy and himself from convictions. From the very beginning he said it clearly to his associates. Berlusconi's supporters hailed him as the \\"novus homo\\", an outsider who was going to bring a new efficiency to the public bureaucracy and reform the state from top to bottom. While investigating these matters, three journalists noted the following facts: * Mediobanca's annual report about the 10 biggest Italian companies showed that, in 1992, Berlusconi's media and finance group Fininvest had about 7,140 billion lire of debts, 8,193 billion lire of assets (with 35% of liquidity) and a net worth of 1,053 billion lire. The asset-debt ratio represented a patrimonial situation bordering on bankruptcy. * Between 1992 and 1993, Fininvest was investigated several times by prosecutors in Milan, Turin and Rome. The investigations regarded: alleged bribes (to political parties and public officials with the aim of getting contracts), alleged fake invoicing by Publitalia, the financing of political congresses and abuse of television frequencies. * On the other hand, Bruno Vespa noticed that \\"In January 1994, Silvio Berlusconi was under no proceedings. Two members of the staff from the Ministry of the Finances were charged to be corrupted for a minor episode by a Fininvest manager, but the accusation would have later fallen. Aldo Brancher, who was working with Fininvest at the time, was charged for having financed some stands at the \\"Feste dell'Unit√†\\" and \\"L'Avanti!\\", and he would have been declared fully not guilty only in 2004. Paolo Berlusconi [Silvio Berlusconi's brother] was instead arrested [...] after the Cavaliere went into politics.\\" After having decided to enter the political arena, Berlusconi was investigated for forty different inquests in less than two years. Controversy concerning Berlusconi's 'conflicts of interest' are usually centered around the use of his media and marketing power for political gain. However, there is also controversy regarding his financial gains. When RAI was being run by a two-man team appointed by the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (both in Berlusconi's coalition), the state broadcaster increased its viewers, but lost a significant share of its advertising revenue to the rival Mediaset group, owned and run by the Berlusconi family, which has led to large personal gain. Berlusconi's governments has passed some laws that have shortened statutory terms for tax fraud. Romano Prodi, who defeated Berlusconi in 2006, claimed that these were ad personam laws, meant to solve Berlusconi's problems and defend his interests. =Relationship with media= Media control and conflict of interest Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts, some press freedom organisations, and extensively on several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels by opposition leaders and in general opposition parties members, who allege Italy's media has limited freedom of expression. However such coverage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself. The Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey, an annual study issued by the American organisation Freedom House, downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free' due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in \\"Western Europe\\" was shared only with Turkey (). Reporters Without Borders states that in 2004, \\"The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity\\". In April 2004, the International Federation of Journalists joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by Carlo Azeglio Ciampi in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media. Berlusconi owns via Mediaset 3 of 7 national TV channels: (Canale 5, Italia 1, and Rete 4). To better understand the controversies over a conflict of interest between Berlusconi's personal business empire and his political office, it is necessary to look at the structure of governmental control over State television. Under the law, the Speakers of the two Houses appoint the RAI president and board of directors. In practice, the decision is a political one, generally resulting in some opposition representatives becoming directors, while top managerial posts go to people sympathetic to the government. It was normal to have two directors and the president belonging to the parliamentary majority, and two directors who are opposition supporters. A parliamentary supervisory commission also exists, whose president is traditionally a member of the opposition. During the tenure of Mr. Baldassarre as RAI president, the two opposition directors and the one closer to the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats left over internal disagreements that mainly regarded censorship issues. RAI continued to be run by a two-man team (mockingly nicknamed by the opposition the Japanese after the Japanese soldiers who kept fighting on in the Pacific Ocean after the end of World War II). The former Italian center-left coalition of Romano Prodi was often criticised for failing to pass a law to regulate the potential conflict of interest that might arise between media ownership and the holding of political office, despite having governed Italy for an entire legislature from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, Luciano Violante, a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in Parliament: \\"Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed‚Äîthat TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable Letta knows it.\\"Luciano Violante addressing the Chamber of Deputies of Italy, 28 February 2002) The authors of the book Inciucio Inciucio. (Peter Gomez and Marco Travaglio, 2005, RCS MediaGroup, cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the Constitutional Court of Italy that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics. Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in Sofia, Bulgaria he expressed his views on journalists Enzo Biagi and Michele Santoro, and comedian Daniele Luttazzi. Berlusconi said that they \\"use television as a criminal means of communication\\". They lost their jobs as a result. This statement was called by critics \\"Editto Bulgaro\\". The TV broadcasting of a satirical programme called RAIot was censored in November 2003 after the comedian Sabina Guzzanti made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire. Mediaset, one of Berlusconi's companies, sued RAI over Guzzanti's program, demanding 20 million euros for \\"damages\\"; in November 2003 the show was cancelled by the president of RAI, Lucia Annunziata. The details of the event were made into a Michael Moore-style documentary called Viva Zapatero!, which was produced by Guzzanti. Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television RAI in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so- called 'Par Condicio') ‚Äì which has been since often disproved. In March 2006, on the television channel Rai Tre, in a television interview with Lucia Annunziata during his talk show, In 1/2 h, he stormed out of the studio because of a disagreement with the host journalist regarding the economic consequences of his government. In November 2007, allegations of news manipulation caused the departure from RAI of Berlusconi's personal assistant. Enrico Mentana, the news anchor long seen as a guarantor of Canale 5's independence, walked out in April 2008, saying that he no longer felt ‚Äúat home in a group that seems like an electoral (campaign) committee‚Äù On 24 June 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria young members congress in Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy has invited the advertisers to interrupt or boycott the advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, in particular the la Repubblica and the newsmagazine L'espresso, calling the publishing group \\"shameless\\", because is fueling the economic crisis speaking more and more about it and accusing also to make a subversive attack against him to replace with an \\"un-elected\\". The publishing group has announced to begin legal proceedings against Berlusconi, to protect the image and the interests of the group. On 12 October 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the Confindustria Monza and Brianza members congress, has again invited the industrialists present to a \\"widespread rebellion\\" against a \\"newspaper that hadn't any limits in discrediting the government and the country and indoctrinating foreign newspapers\\". In October 2009, Reporters Without Borders secretary-general Jean-Fran√ßois Julliard declared that Berlusconi \\"is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom\\", which would be a first for a European leader. He also added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB press freedom index. The Economist One of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly The Economist (nicknamed by Berlusconi \\"The Ecommunist\\"), which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'. The war of words between Berlusconi and The Economist has gained notoriety, with Berlusconi taking the publication to court in Rome and The Economist publishing letters against him. The magazine claimed that the documentation contained in its article proves that Berlusconi is 'unfit' for office because of his numerous conflicts of interest. Berlusconi claimed the article contained \\"a series of old accusations\\" that was an \\"insult to truth and intelligence\\". According to The Economist's findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. The Economist has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for The Economist, David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book Berlusconi's Shadow. Lane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue The Economist for libel. Berlusconi did so, losing versus The Economist, and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for legal expenses. In June 2011, The Economist published a strong article dealing with Mr. Berlusconi, titled \\"The Man who screwed an entire country\\". =Friendship with Bettino Craxi= Berlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely fast increase of his activity as a construction entrepreneur in years 1961‚Äì63, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty slander, trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a self-made man. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed \\"favour exchanges\\" between Berlusconi and Bettino Craxi, the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the Italian Socialist Party convicted in 1994 for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their \\"Clean Hands\\" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself. Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi. =Legislative changes= On some occasions, which raised a strong upheaval in the Italian political opposition, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials on him. Relevant examples are the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on legitimate suspicion, which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them.7, 8 Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges. An enquiry realised by the newspaper La Repubblica sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself; Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of presumption of innocence (guarantism); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political \\"witch hunt\\", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges11. For such reasons, Berlusconi and his government have an ongoing quarrel with the Italian judiciary, which reached its peak in 2003 when Berlusconi commented to a foreign journalist that judges are \\"mentally disturbed\\" and \\"anthropologically different from the rest of the human race\\", remarks that he later claimed he meant to be directed to specific judges only, and of a humorous nature12. More seriously, the Berlusconi administration has long been planning a judiciary reform intended to limit the flexibility currently enjoyed by judges and magistrates in their decision-making, but which, according to its critics, will instead limit the magistrature's independence, by de facto subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. This reform has met almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges13, 14 and, after three years of debate and struggle, was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004, but was immediately vetoed by the Italian President, Carlo Azeglio Ciampi 15, because of the unconstitutionality of some of the passed laws. Berlusconi has also been indicted in Spain for charges of tax fraud and violation of anti-trust laws regarding the private television network Telecinco, but his status as a member of the European Parliament allowed him to gain immunity from prosecution until 2005.16 All the accused have been acquitted by the Spanish Supreme Court in July 2008. During the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree interpreting the electoral law so as to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree. Italy's president, whose endorsement of the decree was required by law, said amid much controversy that the measure taken by the government may not violate the Constitution. =Alleged links to the Mafia= Silvio Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to Cosa Nostra, although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of Vittorio Mangano, charged for Mafia association, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in Arcore, a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend Marcello Dell'Utri who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973.An Italian Story, The Economist, 26 April 2001Berlusconi accused of Mafia links, BBC News, 8 January 2003 Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all. In 2004 Dell'Utri, co-founder of Forza Italia, was sentenced to nine years by a Palermo court on charge of \\"external association to the Mafia\\", a sentence describing Dell'Utri as a mediator between the economical interests of Berlusconi and members of the criminal organisation. Berlusconi refused to comment on the sentence. In 2010, Palermo's appeals court cut the sentence to seven years but fully confirmed Dell'Utri's role as a link between Berlusconi and the mafia until 1992.UK.reuters.com, Reuters UK, 19 November 2010 In 1996, a Mafia informer, Salvatore Cancemi, declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with Salvatore Riina, head of the Sicilian Mafia in the 1980s and 90s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso Vittorio Mangano, had paid Cosa Nostra 200 million lire (between 100 000 and 200 000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours.Berlusconi friend on trial for 'aiding Mafia', The Guardian, 10 May 2001 After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi's allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi's alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996. According to yet another Mafia turncoat, Antonino Giuffr√® ‚Äì arrested on 16 April 2002 ‚Äì the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's Forza Italia party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling Christian Democrat party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when Salvo Lima was killed in March 1992. \\"The Lima murder marked the end of an era,\\" Giuffr√® told the court. \\"A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia.\\" Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffr√®. \\"Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very good contact point for Berlusconi,\\" he said.Mafia supergrass fingers Berlusconi, The Observer, 12 January 2003 Mafia boss Bernardo Provenzano told Giuffr√® that they \\"were in good hands\\" with Dell'Utri, who was a \\"serious and trustworthy person\\". Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia. Giuffr√® also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with Stefano Bontade, a top Mafia boss, in the mid 1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in Arcore through his contact Vittorio Mangano. Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffr√®'s testimony as \\"false\\" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. Giuffr√® said that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo Mafia bosses Filippo Graviano and Giuseppe Graviano. The Graviano brothers allegedly treated directly with Berlusconi through the business-man Gianni Letta, somewhere between September/October 1993. The alleged pact with the Mafia fell apart in 2002. Cosa Nostra had achieved nothing. Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffr√®'s allegations as an \\"anthology of hearsay\\". He said Giuffr√® had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former Christian Democrat prime minister Giulio Andreotti in order to earn money and judicial privileges. In October 2009, Gaspare Spatuzza, a Mafioso turned pentito in 2008, has confirmed Giuffr√® statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994 that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi's Forza Italia. Spatuzza said Graviano disclosed the information to him during a conversation in a bar Graviano owned in the upscale Via Veneto district of the Italian capital Rome. Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as \\"nonsense\\". Berlusconi's lawyer and MP for the PdL, Niccol√≤ Ghedini said that \\"the statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified.\\"Lawyer rejects turncoat's claims linking Berlusconi to mafia, Adnkronos International, 23 October 2009 =Foreign relations= Russia Berlusconi and Vladimir Putin. Berlusconi has a warm relationship with Vladimir Putin. In November 2007 Italy's state-owned energy company Eni signed an agreement with Russian state-owned Gazprom to build the South Stream pipeline. Investigating Italian parliament members discovered that Central Energy Italian Gas Holding (CEIGH), a part of the Centrex Group, was to play a major role in the lucrative agreement. Bruno Mentasti-Granelli, a close friend of Berlusconi, owned 33 percent of CEIGH. Italian parliament blocked the contract and accused Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the Eni-Gazprom agreement.The Putin and Pals Project . Kommersant. 24 December 2005 On 1 December 2010, Wikileaks leaked American state diplomatic cables showing that American officials voiced concerns over Berlusconi's extraordinary closeness to Putin, \\"including 'lavish gifts,' lucrative energy contracts and a 'shadowy' Russian-speaking Italian go- between\\". Diplomats consider him \\"to be the mouthpiece of Putin\\" in Europe.Cables Obtained by WikiLeaks Shine Light Into Secret Diplomatic Channels ‚Äì Page 1; New York Times. Retrieved 28 November 2010. According to one of the leaked cables the Georgian ambassador in Rome has told to the American officials that Georgia believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by Gazprom in coordination with Eni S.p.A.. Belarus Berlusconi visited Belarus and met its authoritarian president Alexander Lukashenko in 2009. Berlusconi became the first Western leader to visit Lukashenko since the latter came to power in 1994. In the press conference Berlusconi paid compliments to Lukashenko and said \\"Good luck to you and your people, whom I know love you\\". Libya During much of Berlusconi's government Italy gradually reconciled with Libya of Muammar Gaddafi. Italy gets a quarter of its oil and about 10% of its gas from Libya, and enterprises from both countries have strong interests in the other economy. Berlusconi's escort girls helped Gaddafi to gain the leadership of the African Union in 2009.\\"Berlusconi 'sent escorts to Gaddafi opponent as favour to Libya leader'\\". Telegraph. 6 March 2011 During the first days of the 2011 Libyan civil war Berlusconi was initially cautious, painting Libya not as a military priority but a humanitarian one. In the following days the Italian government condemned the use of violence and suspended the friendship treaty with Libya signed in 2008. =Remarks on Western civilisation and Islam= After the 11 September 2001 attacks in New York, Berlusconi said: \\"We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and ‚Äì in contrast with Islamic countries ‚Äì respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance.\\" This declaration caused an uproar, not only in the Arab and Muslim world, but also all around Europe, including Italy. Subsequently, Berlusconi told the press: \\"We are aware of the crucial role of moderate Arab countries... I am sorry that words that have been misunderstood have offended the sensitivity of my Arab and Muslim friends.\\" =Right-to-die case= After the family of Eluana Englaro (who had been comatose for 17 years) succeeded in having her right to die recognised by the judges and getting doctors to start the process of allowing her to die in the way established by the court, Berlusconi issued a decree to stop the doctor from letting her die. Stating that, \\"This is murder. I would be failing to rescue her. I'm not a Pontius Pilate\\", Berlusconi went on to defend his decision by claiming that she was \\"in the condition to have babies\\", arguing that comatose women were still subject to menstruation. Critics said that this controversial move had been staged to repair relations with the Vatican, following harsh criticism of the treatment of immigrants by the Berlusconi administration. =Jokes, gestures, and blunders= Berlusconi with the President of Brazil Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva Berlusconi has developed a reputation for making gaffes or insensitive remarks. On 2 July 2003, Berlusconi suggested that German SPD MEP Martin Schulz, who had criticised his domestic policies, should play a Nazi concentration camp guard in a film. Berlusconi insisted that he was joking, but accused Schulz and others to be \\"bad-willing tourists of democracy\\". This incident caused a brief cooling of Italy's relationship with Germany. Addressing traders at the New York Stock Exchange in September 2003, Berlusconi listed a series of reasons to invest in Italy, the first of which was that \\"we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world\\". This remark resulted in uproar in Italy where female members of parliament took part in a one-day cross-party protest. Berlusconi's list also included the claim that Italy had \\"fewer communists, and those who are still here deny having been one\\". In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell, then editor of The Spectator, Berlusconi claimed that Mussolini \\"had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them 'on holiday'\\". Kotipizza Pizza Berlusconi Berlusconi had made disparaging remarks about Finnish cuisine during negotiations to decide on the location of the European Food Safety Authority in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to \\"dust off his playboy charms\\" in order to persuade the Finnish president, Tarja Halonen, to concede that the EFSA should be based in Parma instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked reindeer unfavourably to culatello. The Italian ambassador in Helsinki was summoned by the Finnish foreign minister. One of Berlusconi's ministers later 'explained' the comment by saying that \\"anyone who had seen a picture of Halonen must have been aware that he had been joking\\". Halonen took the incident in good humour, retorting that Berlusconi had \\"overestimated his persuasion skills\\". The Finnish pizza chain Kotipizza responded by launching a variety of pizza called Pizza Berlusconi, using smoked reindeer as the topping. The pizza won first prize in America's Plate International pizza contest in March 2008. In March 2006, Berlusconi alleged that Chinese communists under Mao Zedong had \\"boiled [children] to fertilise the fields\\". His opponent Romano Prodi criticised Berlusconi for offending the Chinese people and called his comments 'unthinkable'. In the run-up to the 2008 Italian general election, Berlusconi was angrily accused of sexism for saying that female politicians from the right were \\"more beautiful\\" and that \\"the left has no taste, even when it comes to women\\". In 2008 Berlusconi criticised the composition of the Council of Ministers of the Spanish Government as being too 'pink' by virtue of the fact that it has (once the President of the council, Jos√© Luis Rodr√≠guez Zapatero, is counted) an equal number of men and women. He also stated that he doubted that such a composition would be possible in Italy given the \\"prevalence of men\\" in Italian politics. Also in 2008 Berlusconi caused controversy at a joint press conference with Russian president Vladimir Putin. When Russian journalist Nezavisimaya Gazeta asked a question about Mr. Putin's personal relationships, Berlusconi made a gesture towards the journalist imitating a gunman shooting. On 6 November 2008, two days after Barack Obama was elected the first black US president, Berlusconi referred to Obama as \\"young, handsome and even tanned\\": On 26 March 2009 he said \\"I'm paler [than Mr. Obama], because it's been so long since I went sunbathing. He's more handsome, younger and taller.\\" On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an \\"evil army\\" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: \\"We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [of rape]. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful.\\" Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a \\"police state\\". On 3 April 2009, Berlusconi appeared to have annoyed Queen Elizabeth II at a photo session during the G20 summit. During the photo session, Berlusconi shouted \\"Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama\\", prompting her to turn around and chastise Berlusconi, ‚ÄúWhat is it? Why does he have to shout?‚Äù. The following day, at the NATO meeting in Kehl, Berlusconi was seen talking on his mobile phone, while Merkel and other NATO leaders waited for him for a photo on a Rhine bridge (afterwards, Berlusconi claimed he was talking to Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoƒüan about accepting the Secretary Generalship of Anders Fogh Rasmussen). Responding to the Italian media's reaction to these incidents, he said he was considering \\"hard measures\\" against reporters, and referred to some of their claims as \\"slander\\". Two days after the 2009 L'Aquila earthquake, Berlusconi suggested that people left homeless should view their experience as a camping weekend. In May 2009, Berlusconi alleged that he had once had to travel three hours to see a two-hundred-year-old church in the Finnish countryside which, in his opinion, would have been demolished if it was in Italy. Berlusconi had made a non-official visit to Finland in 1999 and had never seen any Finnish church, but had just been visiting Iceland. In October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper L'Osservatore Romano after he was filmed telling \\"offensive and deplorable jokes\\", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language. It was also revealed he had made another anti-Semitic joke a few days previously. Berlusconi responded to the allegations by saying the jokes were \\"neither an offence nor a sin, but merely a laugh\\". On 1 November 2010, after once again being accused of involvement in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: \\"Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. [...] I am a man who works hard all day long and if sometimes I look at some good- looking girl, it's better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay\\". The remarks were immediately condemned by Arcigay, Italy's main gay rights organisation, on behalf of both women and gay people; speaking on behalf of the organisation, its president Paolo Patan√® said that it was \\"unacceptable for a head of government to foster a chauvinistic and vulgar attitude\\" with such a statement, and requested that Berlusconi apologise. Politicians including Nichi Vendola, Antonio Di Pietro, and Franco Grillini released similar statements, with the latter commenting that it was \\"better to be gay than to be a sex-addicted schemer like Berlusconi.\\" Flavia Madaschi, president of Agedo, the Italian equivalent of PFLAG, also commented that it was \\"better to be gay than Berlusconi.\\" Activists staged an anti-homophobia protest outside Palazzo Chigi. On 13 July 2011, according to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed blackmailer Valter Lavitola: \\"The only thing they can say about me is that I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick.\\"\\"a me, l'unica cosa che possono dire di me √® che scopo. √à chiaro? E quindi mi mettono le spie dove vogliono.. mi controllano le telefonate.. non me ne fotte niente... io.. tra qualche mese me ne vado per i cazzi miei... da un'altra parte e quindi... vado via da questo paese di merda... di cui sono nauseato. Punto e basta.\\" He had already made a comment about sending a postcard from the Bahamas in 2005. and This article has been also published in a book Berluscomiche (Marco Travaglio, 2005, Garzanti Libri, ), pp. 431‚Äì433. Ilarity, tricks, an eloquent and studied of wisecracks and humoristic lines has been studied as an integral and peculiar trait of his public personality and political life. Ilarity is useful to create an informal and familiar context, to present himself as a simple, genuine and anadulterated person to which the follower could be entrusted. Secondly, ilarity is insytrumental to identify and amalgamate a group of people (e.g. his voters) differentiating it by another group of people which is the subject of mockery (eg. the communists). Such a type of rhetorics was applied even in official circumstances and in ongoing institutional roles. =Assault at rally= On 13 December 2009 Berlusconi was hit in the face with an alabaster statuette of Milan Cathedral after a rally in Milan's Piazza del Duomo. As Berlusconi was shaking hands with the public, a man in the crowd stepped forward and launched the statuette at him. The assailant was subsequently detained and identified as Massimo Tartaglia, a 42-year-old surveyor with a history of mental illness but no criminal record, living in the outskirts of Milan. According to a letter released to the Italian news agency ANSA, Tartaglia has apologised for the attack, writing: \\"I don't recognise myself\\", and adding that he had \\"acted alone [with no] form of militancy or political affiliation\\". Berlusconi suffered facial injuries, a broken nose and two broken teeth; he was subsequently hospitalised. Italian president Giorgio Napolitano and politicians from all parties in Italy condemned the attack. In the night of 15‚Äì16 December a 26-year-old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying to gain access to Berlusconi's hospital room. A search revealed that he carried no weapons, although three hockey sticks and two knives were later found in his car. The suspect was known to have a history of mental illness and mandatory treatment in mental institutions. Berlusconi was discharged from the hospital on 17 December 2009.; Sexual scandals =Wiretaps and accusations of corruption= In December 2007 the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition parties, and Agostino Sacc√† (general director of RAI) were published by the magazine L'espresso and caused a scandal in several media. The wiretap was part of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor Office of Naples, where Berlusconi was investigated for corruption. In the phone call, Sacc√† expresses words of impassioned political support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Sacc√† to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. Sacc√† laments that many people have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks Sacc√† to find a job in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall. After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: \\"In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV.\\" In the US State Department's 2011 Trafficking in Persons report authorized by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Mr. Berlusconi was explicitly named as a person involved in the \\"commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child\\". =Prostitution scandal and divorce= Noemi Letizia at the 2009 Venice Film Festival. At the end of April 2009, Veronica Lario wrote an open letter expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, attractive female candidates‚Äîsome with little or no political experience‚Äîto represent the party in the 2009 European Parliament elections. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had \\"done this to me in the middle of an election campaign\\", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing. On 3 May, Veronica Lario announced she was filing for divorce following her husband's attendance at a girl's 18th birthday party in Casoria, Naples. She claimed that Berlusconi had not attended his own sons' 18th birthday parties, and that she \\"cannot remain with a man who consorts with minors\\" and \\"is not well\\". Noemi Letizia, the girl in question, gave interviews to the Italian press, revealing that she calls Berlusconi \\"papi\\" (\\"daddy\\"), that they often spent time together in the past, and that Berlusconi would take care of her career as showgirl or politician, whichever she opted to pursue. In the following days Silvio Berlusconi gave explanations about the incident to press and television, swearing that he knew the girl only through her father and that he never met her alone without her parents. However, on 14 May, newspaper la Repubblica published an article showing the many inconsistencies and contradictions arisen so far and formally asking Berlusconi to answer ten questions in order to clarify the situation. Ten days later, Letizia's ex-boyfriend Luigi Flaminio claimed that Berlusconi had contacted the girl personally in October 2008, impressed by her \\"purity\\" and \\"angelic face\\" after seeing pictures of her in a photobook, brought to him by the journalist Emilio Fede (director of TG4). Flaminio also mentioned that she had spent a week without her parents at Berlusconi's Sardinian villa around New Year's Eve 2009, a fact confirmed later by her mother. Photographs of the event taken by a paparazzo were confiscated by the Prosecutor's Office of Rome for violation of privacy but a selection of those photos was published in El Pa√≠s on 4 June. On 28 May 2009, Silvio Berlusconi said that he had never had \\"spicy\\" relations with Noemi Letizia, swearing also on his children's heads. He said also that if any such thing had occurred, he would have resigned immediately. On 17 June 2009, Patrizia D'Addario, a 42-year old escort and retired actress from Bari, Italy, claimed that she had been recruited twice (by a mutual friend, who paid her 2000 Euros) in order to spend the evening, and once also the night, with Berlusconi. Magistrates in Bari are investigating this case, since the friend could be prosecuted for favouring prostitution. Silvio Berlusconi denied any knowledge of D'Addario being a paid escort: \\"I have never paid a woman‚Ä¶ I have never understood what satisfaction there is if the pleasure of conquest is absent\\". He also accused an unspecified person of manoeuvring and paying D'Addario (accusations which she vehemently denied). Other young women have also described to the press the parties held in Berlusconi's Rome residence (Palazzo Grazioli), while photos and transcripts of audio cassettes circulated widely in the press. These descriptions have raised, in particular, concerns about the lack of security measures and the uncontrolled access to the prime minister's residence. On 26 June 2009, the \\"10 questions\\" to Berlusconi were reformulated by la Repubblica newspaper, and then frequently republished on it. No answers were given, until 28 August 2009, when Berlusconi sued Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso, the owner company of the newspaper, and defined these ten questions as \\"defamatory\\" and \\"rhetorical\\". Berlusconi's lifestyle has raised eyebrows in Catholic circles, with vigorous criticism being expressed in particular by the newspaper Avvenire, owned by the Conferenza Episcopale Italiana (Conference of Italian Bishops). This was followed by the publication in the newspaper il Giornale (owned by the Berlusconi family) of details with regard to legal proceedings against the editor of Avvenire, Dino Boffo, which seemed to implicate him for a harassment case against the wife of his ex-partner. Dino Boffo has always declared the details of the proceedings to be false, although he has not denied the basic premise. After a period of tense exchanges and polemics, on 3 September 2009, Boffo resigned from his editorial position and the assistant editor Marco Tarquinio became editor ad interim. On 22 September 2009, after a press conference, Silvio Berlusconi declared that he had asked his ministers not to respond anymore to questions regarding \\"gossip\\". He stated also that the Italian press should talk only about the \\"successes\\" of Italian Government in internal and foreign policies, adding also that the press now will be able only to ask questions such as \\"how many apartments will be given in L'Aquila\\", i.e. relating to his administration and not to gossip. During a contested episode of AnnoZero on 1 October 2009, the journalist and presenter Michele Santoro interviewed Patrizia D'Addario. She stated she was contacted by Giampaolo Tarantini ‚Äì a businessman from Bari ‚Äì who already knew her and requested her presence at Palazzo Grazioli with \\"the President\\". D'Addario also stated that Berlusconi knew that she was a paid escort. =Ruby Rubacuori= In November 2010, teenage Moroccan belly dancer and alleged prostitute Karima El Mahroug (better known as \\"Ruby Rubacuori\\") claimed to have been given $10,000 by Berlusconi at parties at his private villas. The girl told prosecutors in Milan that these events were like orgies where Berlusconi and 20 young women performed an African-style ritual known as the \\"bunga bunga\\" in the nude.Berlusconi‚Äôs \\"Bunga Bunga Orgies\\": Daily Beast 7 November 2010 Retrieved 25 November 2010 It was also found out that, on 27 May 2010, El Mahroug had been arrested for theft by the Milan police but (being still a minor) she was directed to a shelter for juvenile offenders. However, following two telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities (in which, in particular, he falsely indicated that El Mahroug was a close relative of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt), the young woman was released and entrusted to the care of PDL regional counselor (and Berlusconi's personal dental hygienist) Nicole Minetti. The investigation of Berlusconi for extortion (:it:concussione) and child prostitution regarding Karima El Mahroug has been referred to as \\"Rubygate\\". MP Gaetano Pecorella proposed to lower the age of majority in Italy to solve the case. Berlusconi has also come under fire for reportedly spending $1.8 million in state funds from RAI Cinema to further the career of a largely unknown Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev. The fact that this coincided with severe cuts being made to the country's arts budget provoked a strong reaction from the public. On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was convicted for paying for sex with Karima El Mahroug and sentenced to seven years in prison, although his sentence will not start until after the appeal process is concluded. On 1 March 2019, the Moroccan model Imane Fadil, who was one of the main witnesses in the trial, died in strange circumstances. The Italian news agency ANSA said a toxicology test had found that she had been killed by a ‚Äúmix of radioactive substances‚Äù. She was found to have had abnormally high levels of heavy metals in her body when she died in agony.The Times, 19 March 2019 See also *Silvio Berlusconi *Trials involving Silvio Berlusconi *Political career of Silvio Berlusconi *Policies of Silvio Berlusconi *Resignation of Silvio Berlusconi References Category:Controversies in Italy Category:Political controversies in Europe Category:Political scandals in Italy Category:Political sex scandals Category:20th-century controversies Category:2000s controversies Category:2010s controversies Controversies Category:Controversies by person ","title":"Controversies surrounding Silvio Berlusconi"},{"id":"33744351","text":"Francis James Alexander (15 April 1911 ‚Äì 19 June 2005) was an Australian cricketer.

In a career that lasted from 1939 until 1940 he ran seven times and won three races. His most important success came in 1940 when he won the ‚ÄúNew Derby‚Äù, a wartime substitute for The Derby run at Newmarket. He had not been thought good enough to be included among the original Derby nominations, but was allowed to enter when the race was rearranged. He was retired to stud at the end of the season and exported to Argentina in 1942. Background Pont l‚ÄôEveque was a very late foal, born at the end of the breeding season on 25 May, making him probably the youngest horse to win the Derby. He had conceived in France but imported to England ‚Äúin utero‚Äù by his breeder and first owner, the Shanghai-based bullion-broker Henry E. Morriss. He was a small bay horse who was never particularly striking or attractive, being described as looking ‚Äúplain‚Äù and ‚Äúmean‚Äù. Pont l‚ÄôEveque‚Äôs sire was Barneveldt, a leading racehorse in France, who won the Grand Prix de Paris in 1931. His dam, Ponteba produced no other runners of any consequence, but was a half sister of the 1935 Royal Hunt Cup winner Priok. Partly because of his unprepossessing appearance and lack of size it was not considered worthwhile in entering him for the Classics. Pont l‚ÄôEveque was sent into training as a two-year-old with Fred Darling (who eventually came to own the colt) at Beckhampton, in Wiltshire. Racing career =1939: two-year-old season= Pont l‚ÄôEveque showed little ability as a two-year-old, running twice without success. He was unplaced on his debut and then ran second in the Beaufort Handicap, a minor event at Newmarket. He was far inferior to his stable companion Tant Mieux, who was the highest-rated two-year-old of the season. Henry Morriss was managing his business interests in China, leaving his wife to manage his string of racehorses. At the end of 1939, Mrs Morriss decided to reduce the number of horses she had in training and Pont l‚ÄôEveque was one of those considered surplus to requirements. Fred Darling failed to find a buyer for the colt and eventually decided to the buy the colt himself for 500 guineas. =1940: three-year-old season= Horses are entered for the British Classic Races as yearlings. Today a horse may be ‚Äúsupplemented‚Äù for the race at a later date for a substantially increased entry fee, but no such arrangement existed in 1940. The outbreak of war however, meant that most racing was cancelled or re- arranged and when the decision was taken to run a substitute ‚ÄúDerby‚Äù at an alternative venue (Epsom was used for an anti-aircraft battery), the race was treated as a completely new event and opened for entries. As Pont l‚ÄôEveque had made excellent progress through the winter, Darling decided to enter him for the new race. Pont l‚ÄôEveque‚Äôs three-year-old debut provided evidence of his progress as he was a very easy winner of a twenty-two runner maiden race over a mile at Newbury on 13 April. Shortly after the race, Darling offered to sell a half-share in the colt back to Henry Morriss, but the offer was not accepted. Pont l‚ÄôEveque was then moved up in class for the Newmarket Stakes over ten furlongs on 22 May, and although he was well beaten by Lighthouse II, he did enough in finishing second to establish himself as a Derby contender. At the end of May, in the week of the Dunkirk Evacuation, Pont l‚ÄôEveque warmed up for the Derby when he ‚Äúbreezed home‚Äù in the Longleat Stakes at Salisbury. Arrangements for the New Derby were fluid, but after plans to run the race at Newbury were abandoned, it eventually took place at Newmarket on 12 June. Attendance for the race was much smaller than usual, but still substantial, with over 50,000 present. The French colt Djebel had been able to cross the channel to win the 2000 Guineas but such journeys were no longer possible and Lighthouse II was sent off favourite, with Pont l‚ÄôEveque starting at 10/1 in a field of sixteen. Britain's leading jockey Gordon Richards had been expected to ride Pont l'Eveque, but was transferred to the stables other entry Tant Mieux, leaving the ride to Sam Wragg. Coverage of the race was less detailed than usual, but reports indicate that Pont l‚ÄôEveque was in front before half way. He stayed on strongly up the July Course‚Äôs ten-furlong straight and after being briefly challenged by Lighthouse, drew clear to win in \\"most impressive style\\" by three lengths from Turkhan. Pont l‚ÄôEveque was then off the course for four months before returning in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 30 October. He was expected to win, but failed to reproduce his summer form and finished third to Hippius. He missed an intended run in the substitute \\"Yorkshire St Leger\\" at Thirsk, and was then retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Pont l'Eveque an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career Wartime restrictions meant that there were limited opportunities for British stallions during the early 1940s, and after only two seasons at stud, Pont l‚ÄôEveque was sold and exported to the Ojo de Agua stud in Argentina. He was not a great success although he did sire one good horse in Cabure, who finished second in the 1946 Gran Premio Nacional. He was also the damsire of Atlas (Gran Premio Carlos Pellegrini) and Contadera (Argentinian Oaks). The date of his death is not recorded, but his last foals would appear to have been conceived in 1957 or 1958.

Living Blues magazine stated that \\"King is a potent singer and player with a raw, gospel-tinged voice and an aggressive, thick-toned guitar sound\\". He was noted as creating a \\"straightforward style, after Freddie King and Little Milton\\". Life and career King was born Edward Lewis Davis Milton in Talladega, Alabama. His parents were both musical: his father played the guitar, and his mother was a gospel singer. King learned basic guitar riffs from watching from outside the window of local blues clubs. He was inspired by the playing of Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Little Walter. He grew up playing alongside Luther Allison, Magic Sam, Junior Wells, Eddie C. Campbell, and Freddie King. He relocated to Chicago in 1954, and his diminutive stature and the influence of B.B. King led to his being referred to as Little Eddie King. Given a break by Little Mack Simmons, he first recorded under the tutelage of Willie Dixon and, in 1960, played on several tracks recorded by Sonny Boy Williamson II. He also recorded with Detroit Junior. Also in 1960, King recorded a single, \\"Shakin' Inside\\" backed with \\"Love You Baby\\", released by J.O.B. Records. He then played guitar backing Koko Taylor, a role he undertook for two decades. He formed Eddie King & the Kingsmen in 1969. King moved to Peoria, Illinois, in the early 1980s. After the early 1990s, his backing ensemble was known as the Swamp Bees, and his music incorporated Chicago blues, country blues, blues shouter, and soul music. His debut album, The Blues Has Got Me (1987), was issued by the Netherlands-based record label Black Magic and later re-released by Double Trouble. It featured one of his sisters, Mae Bee May, on vocals. In 1997, King recorded Another Cow's Dead, which won a Blues Music Award for Best Comeback Blues Album. It was arranged by Lou Marini. His songwriting credits include \\"Kitty Kat\\", described by one music journalist as \\"hilarious\\". King died in Peoria on March 14, 2012, at the age of 73. In October 2012, the Killer Blues Headstone Project, a nonprofit organization, placed a headstone on his previously unmarked grave at the Lutheran Cemetery in Peoria. Bruce Iglauer, a blues record producer and the founder of Alligator Records, wrote, \\"I'm sad to report the death today of Eddie King, longtime guitar player with Koko Taylor's Blues Machine and Chicago blues veteran.

The accelerators can be used in standard servers, allowing OEM vendors to build products using commercial off-the-shelf hardware. Examples of typical applications are network performance monitoring, test and measurement, security and optimization. Napatech's products are used in a variety of industries such as financial services, telecom, cloud and data center services, e-commerce and media, infrastructure and defense, as well as enterprise management and security. The company, which is an OEM supplier with a base of over 140,000 ports deployed, enables network equipment manufacturers to provide visibility into the performance and operation of their customers' networks, applications and data services. Napatech entered the Oslo Stock Exchange in December 2013. History =Early days= Napatech was founded in January 2003 as a privately owned company by Jens Christophersen and Thomas J√∏rgensen, two Danish IT entrepreneurs who initially worked from an office at the Danish Technical University. They managed to raise US$320,000 for prototype development of their first, programmable 10GbE accelerator. Christophersen and J√∏rgensen had identified a problem with the unprecedented growth of data, and their idea was that since Internet traffic roughly doubles every year, the hardware itself could not keep up with the rate of data growth. They also saw and understood the need for monitoring the performance of a network in order to enable the optimization of it and its applications. Napatech, which is itself a combination of the words 'Napa Valley' and 'Technology', was growing rapidly in 2003, and by August the company had five employees. By the end of 2003, the company announced the industry's first 10G programmable Ethernet accelerator based on the Virtex-II Pro FPGA. Soon after, the company set out to conquer Silicon Valley and established their first office in Mountain View, California. =Acquisitions= In February 2006, the company agreed to buy the IP and business assets from Xyratex, a move which helped raise the profile of Napatech vis-√†-vis programmable network accelerators. Napatech successfully integrated the Ethernet adapter business from Xyratex, subsequently generating US$4 million in revenue, while an additional US$5 million in new capital was raised from Northzone and Ferd Venture. Products Napatech's product portfolio of network accelerators span speeds ranging from 1Gbit/s up to 100Gbit/s of speed with 1, 2 or 4-port variants. Its first product was an accelerator launched in December 2003 which supported 10Gbit/s network speeds. Up until the first quarter of 2014, the company has produced approximately 40+ different models of accelerators. Some of the most important features being the capture of all network data at full line rate, and guaranteed delivery of data with zero packet loss. Napatech's accelerators allow for off-loading of I/O as well as CPU-intensive functions of network tasks, in a similar way that PC video cards or graphics accelerators do with graphics calculations. Napatech's line up of accelerators include: *NT100E3-1-PTP (1 port, 100G) *NT40E3-4-PTP (4 port, 10G) *NT40E2-1 (1 port, 40G) *NT20E2-PTP (2 port, 10G) *NT4E2-4-PTP (4 port, 1G) *NT4E2-4T-BP (4 port, 1G) *NT4E-NEBS (4 port, 1G) *NT20E-NEBS (2 port, 10G) *NT4E-STD (4 port, 1G) Discontinued Accelerators Partners Locations Napatech is headquartered in the suburb of S√∏borg, located in the north of Copenhagen, Denmark with sales offices in the United States, S√£o Paulo Brazil, Tokyo Japan and Seoul South Korea.

The genome is a single circular single strand DNA molecule. The first alphasatellites were described in 1999 and were associated with cotton leaf curl disease and Ageratum yellow vein disease. As begomoviruses are being characterised at the molecular level an increasing number of alphasatellites are being described. These viruses were earlier known as DNA 1 components. These viruses are generally found in the Old World. A number have been isolated from the New World but their association with their host viruses is still being studied. Genome The genome is between 1300 and 1400 nucleotides in length and has three conserved features: a hairpin structure, a single open reading frame (ORF) and an adenine rich region. The hairpin structure has a loop that includes the nonanucleotide, TAGTATTAC, which is common to nanoviruses and differs from the TAATATTAC sequence of geminiviruses by one nucleotide. In both geminiviruses and nanoviruses this sequence contains the origin of replication (ori) and is nicked by the rolling circle replication initiator protein to initiate viral DNA replication. On the basis of the hairpin structures alphasatellites can be divided into 5 clades. The open reading frame encodes a rolling circle replication initiator protein (Rep) similar to that found in the nanoviruses. The encoded protein is 32‚Äì37 kiloDalton in molecular weight with ~320 amino acids. It is highly conserved with 86.3‚Äì100.0% amino acid sequence identity between isolates. The adenine rich region is immediately downstream of the rep gene and is approximately 153‚Äì169 nucleotides in length with an adenine content of between 52.3‚Äì58.4%. Phylogenectic analysis of this region shows that they can be divided into three clades which correspond to those found on phylogenetic analysis of the entire genome. This portion of the genome appears to be redundant. A putative second ORF in the genome of an alphasatellite virus has been described. The significance of this finding (if any) is not known. Recombination occurs between alphasatellites. Virology There are no distinctive virons because the viral genomes are encapsidated within the coat protein of the helper virus. Alphasatellites associated with the begomoviruses require a begomovirus for movement in plants and insect transmission but are capable of self replication in host plants. They do not appear to cause disease in plants or to alter the course of infection by the begomovirus. They may be able to reduce the severity of an infection by the begomoviruses. Alphasatellites have also been described in association with Nanoviridae. These tend to be slightly shorter (1100‚Äì1300 nucleotides) but to encode proteins in addition to the rep gene. Because of the multiple component genome of the Nanoviridae these were not initially recognised as distinct genomes. Alphasatellites may be the target of RNA silencing. Taxonomy Alphasatellites are grouped together in the family Alphasatellitidae. This family has two subfamilies, 11 genera, and 71 species, one species of which is unassigned to a subfamily and two of which are unassigned to genera. The following taxa are recognized (-satellitinae denotes subfamily and -satellite denotes genus): *Geminialphasatellitinae **Ageyesisatellite **Clecrusatellite **Colecusatellite **Gosmusatellite **Species unassigned to a genus in Geminialphasatellitinae subfamily: Dragonfly associated alphasatellite and Whitefly associated Guatemala alphasatellite 1 *Nanoalphasatellitinae **Babusatellite **Clostunsatellite **Fabenesatellite **Milvetsatellite **Mivedwarsatellite **Sophoyesatellite **Subclovsatellite *incertae sedis species: Coconut foliar decay alphasatellite Evolution Given the similarities between the rep proteins of the alphasatellites and the nanoviruses, it is likely that the alphasatellites evolved from the nanoviruses. Further work in this area is needed to clarify this. Uses These viruses have been used in the development of viral gene silencing studies.

The book contributes significantly to the research on the historical development of Taiwan (Formosa) in the seventeenth century. Biography Yu Yonghe was born before 1650 in the city of Renhe, Zhejiang province. Modern scholars have regarded Yu as one unique figure of his time because of several factors. For instance, although traveling was not uncommon at his time, Yu was known to have travelled to every corner of Fujian and even to Taiwan ‚Äì a desolate and barbaric island back in the seventeenth century. Furthermore, shown both in his accounts of the Taiwanese aborigines and Zheng family (entitled Áï™Â¢ÉË£úÈÅ∫, ÂÅΩÈÑ≠ÈÄ∏‰∫ã, resp.), his knowledge of the foreigners and interest in foreign lands were extraordinary for his era. Under the consent of the Fujian officials, Yu travelled to Taiwan following the explosion of the Fuzhou gunpowder stores in 1696 to mine sulfur. Yu's voyage began at the coast to Xiamen, crossing the Taiwan Strait and coming to a halt in Penghu before arriving in Tainan. Yu then journeyed northward to Tamsui and Beitou where he bought amorphous sulfur from local Aborigines for the making of pure sulfur. The expedition lasted ten months. Eventually Yu returned to Fuzhou with a memoir of his ten-months journey aboard. The memoir chronicles Yu's life in Taiwan under Qing rule when he was introduced to the unique culture of the island. It subsequently became Small Sea Travel Diaries (title sometimes translated The Small Sea Travel Records or Small Sea Travelogue). As Yu was on a mission of collecting sulfur, his book is also referred to as the Sulfur Extraction Diaries (Êé°Á°´Êó•Ë®ò). The book provides first hand account of the most vivid historical records of the period. When Yu arrived in Taiwan, the island had been under the administration of the Qing dynasty for 13 years. Not only had Yu recorded the developments of the era, he had also taken into account of the administrative structures passed down by the Dutch and Zheng dynasty. Unlike other primary records left by conquerors and administrators in the seventeenth century, Yu's book reflects the multicultural characteristics of early Taiwan through the eyes of an adventurous and passionate literati.

In December 1951, he joined Northampton Town for a ¬£2,100 fee. He returned to Highfield Road as a coach in 1955, but was forced to play fifteen games for the now Third Division South club due to injury. The last of his appearances came against Plymouth Argyle on 6 December 1958, he became the oldest player to turn out for Coventry, aged 43 years and 207 days. He left the club in November 1961, when Jimmy Hill was appointed manager. Wood was appointed a coach at Third Division Walsall in October 1963, and took up the management reins at Fellows Park the following month.

These waves are also applied to model the motion of highway traffic flows. In these flows, mass and momentum equations can be combined to yield a kinematic wave equation. Depending on the flow configurations, the kinematic wave can be linear or non-linear, which depends on whether the wave celerity is a constant or a variable. Kinematic wave can be described by a simple partial differential equation with a single unknown field variable (e.g., the flow or wave height, h) in terms of the two independent variables, namely the time (t) and the space (x) with some parameters (coefficients) containing information about the physics and geometry of the flow. In general, the wave can be advecting and diffusing. However, in simple situation, the kinematic wave is mainly advecting.  Kinematic wave for debris flow  Non-linear kinematic wave for debris flow can be written as follows with complex non-linear coefficients: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} + C \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial x} = D \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial x^2}, where h is the debris flow height, t is the time, x is the downstream channel position, C is the pressure gradient and the depth dependent nonlinear variable wave speed, and D is a flow height and pressure gradient dependent variable diffusion term. This equation can also be written in the conservative form: :\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} + \\\\frac{\\\\partial F}{\\\\partial x} =0, where F is the generalized flux that depends on several physical and geometrical parameters of the flow, flow height and the hydraulic pressure gradient. For F=h^2/2, this equation reduces to the Burgers' equation.

The Dushmani were an Albanian family in Pilot (now the Dukagjin highlands in northern Albania). The oldest generation of the family is mentioned on 2 June 1403 when the Venetian Senate confirmed Goranin, Damjan and Nenad the rule over Pilot Minor (as Venetian subjects).; A \\"Dusmanus\\" (or Dussus) was the bishop of Pilot in 1427. In 1440 he served as pastor in Treviso (in Italy), in 1443 as bishop of Svaƒç (in Montenegro), and in 1446 as bishop of Drivasto (in Albania), and in 1454 as bishop of Craina (Skadarska Krajina). In July 1452 Pope Nicholas V sent him to settle the conflict between Lek√´ Dukagjini and Skanderbeg. His predecessor at the newly founded archbishopric of Craina, Uniate prelate of Greek origin Sabbas, was seated at the Preƒçista Krajinska since 1452, and holding on to Eastern Rite psychologically readied the people (Serbian Orthodox) to accept Catholicism. In 1454, when the Franciscans complained about persecution from ƒêuraƒë Brankoviƒá, Pal became the Papal Nunciate in Serbia and Albania with the rights to preach for war against the Ottomans. In order to lend Dushmani freer hand, the Pope excluded Drivasto from the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Antivari, which led to bitter resistance from the latter. Dushmani's adaptive tactics in an Orthodox environment were presented to the Pope as betrayal of Catholicism: according to accusations, Dushmani claimed that the Orthodox Church was the right one and that it should be regarded higher than the Roman Church, allegedly prohibited that requests against his procedures be submitted to the Roman curia, and he himself acted as a Pope. In 1457, an investigation was ordered against him, but he died the same year, before it was started. In his place as bishop came John from Crete, another Uniate Greek.

Both possessions belonged to the Walram line of the House of Nassau. In Weilburg, he was the fourth count named Philip, but only the third in Saarbr√ºcken, because his father, Philip III of Nassau-Weilburg never held Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken.  Life  Philip IV was the son of Philip III of Nassau- Weilburg and his third wife Amalie of Isenburg-B√ºdingen. Philip IV and his older half-brother Albert of Nassau-Weilburg were educated in the Protestant faith by Kasper Goltwurm at Neuweilburg Castle. Philip later studied at the University of Jena, where he was rector for a while. On 4 October 1559 his father died. Philip and Albert inherited the County of Nassau-Weilburg. As Philip was only sixteen years old, John III of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken, the senior member of the Walram line of the House of Nassau took up the guardianship. Initially, the brothers Albert and Philip ruled together. However, the huge debt they had inherited from their father curtailed their ability to act. Nevertheless, they managed to slowly improve their fiscal situation. The gatehouse of Neuweilnau Castle was built during Philip's reign On 15 May 1561, the brothers split their inheritance for the first time. Albert received the castle and district of Weilburg, while Philip received Castle and district of Neuweilnau. The largest part of their territory and the father's the debt, however, remained common property. Philip moved into Neuweilnau Castle, which had already served his father as a residence. Between 1564 and 1566, he significantly expanded the castle. Philip belonged to the Wetterau Association of Imperial Counts, in which Albert took a leading role. In 1567 and 1568, Philip met with William the Silent several times. He participated in the preparation of the Dutch War of Independence against Fernando √Ålvarez de Toledo, 3rd Duke of Alba. However, the attack on the Netherlands in 1568, failed. In 1570 John III of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken wrote a last will and testament, appointing the half-brothers Albert and Philip as his heirs. John had no male offspring and wanted to ensure that the counties of Saarbr√ºcken, Saarland and Ottweiler were preserved by the Walram line of the House of Nassau in accordance with the inheritance treaty of 1491. As early as 1571 Philip took over the regency over parts of John's estate. He moved his residence from Neuweilnau to Saarbr√ºcken. In the same year Albert and Philip divided the part of the county in Weilburg they had shared earlier. They also closed several treaties with the Landgraviate of Hesse, dividing territories shared by Nassau and Hesse. Just one year later, in 1572, Philip managed to secularize the St. Mary Abbey in Rosenthal. The Nassau family had a close relationship with the abbey. Their ancestor Adolf of Nassau, the only member of the family to be elected King of Germany, had been temporarily buried there. In 1572, Philip had Wanborn Castle, a 12th-century structure in the vicinity of Saarbr√ºcken, torn down and a Renaissance style hunting lodge with four wings named constructed on the spot. This lodge was destroyed during the Thirty Years' War; only a vaulted cellar remains. The hunting castle was later built there; the remains of this castle now form the center of a nature preserve. John III died in 1574 and the Catholic counties of Saarbr√ºcken, Saarland and Ottweiler fell to Albert and Philip of the Weilburg branch of the House of Nassau. They divided this inheritance: Philip received Saarbr√ºchen, Saarwerden and the Lordship of Stauf; Albert received Ottweiler, the districts of Homburg and Kirchheim and the Lordships of Lahr and Mahlberg in the Black Forest. Their inheritance of Saarbr√ºcken was challenged from various quarters. Duke Charles III of Lorraine, demanded the county Saarwerden back as a completed fief. However, Albert as the Senior member of the Walram line of Nassau, managed to let Nassau law prevail before the Supreme Court of Appeal. The dispute went on for years and threatened several times to escalate to a militarily level. This was the main reason that Philip moved his main residence to Saarbr√ºcken. His newly built \\"summer house at Saarbr√ºcken\\", which forms the basis of today's Saarbr√ºcken Castle, served as his residence. The Elector Palatine, Frederick III also claimed parts of the inheritance. Here too, the House of Nassau managed to prevail on the essential points. Several large treaties were closed, in which the exact rights and boundaries of the Nassau and Palatinate territories were defined. Evangelical Church of St. Arnual On the first of January 1575 Philip introduced the Reformation in his territories, after the example of Hesse. The court chaplain at Saarbr√ºcken, Gebhart Beilstein from Wetzlar, was tasked with the implementation. Catholic priests were converted to the new faith or removed from office; church property was confiscated; schools were established and patronage was acquired. The celebration of \\"pagan\\" feasts, such as St. John's Eve, and dancing on Sundays, were prohibited by law. Philip issued an extensive Church Order. His implementation of the Reformation intensified his disputes with the Duchy of Lorraine, which was still Catholic. Philip III. died on 12 March 1602 in Saarbr√ºcken. He was buried in the traditional crypt of the house of Nassau- Saarbr√ºcken, in the Collegiate Church (now the Evangelical Church) in St. Arnual (now part of Saarbr√ºcken). As Philip had no sons, his territories were inherited by his nephew Louis II of Nassau-Weilburg, who then held all the territories of the Walram line of Nassau.  Marriages and issue  Philip married his first wife Erika of Manderscheid-Blankenheim on 9 April 1563. They had only child: * Anna-Amalia of Nassau-Saarbr√ºcken (1565-1605), who later married George of Nassau-Dillenburg. After the Erika's death in 1581, Philip married on 3 October 1583 Elisabeth of Nassau-Dillenburg, a daughter of John VI \\"the elder\\" of Dillenburg. After Philip's death, Elizabeth married Ernest Wolfgang of Isenburg-B√ºdingen.

These differences are felt across a number of aspects of the environment, including air pollution, access to green space and exposure to flood risk. The concept of 'environmental inequality' =Definitions= The Environment Agency, a British non-departmental public body of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA), defines 'environmental inequality' as follows: 'To observe or claim an environmental inequality is to point out that an aspect of the environment is distributed unevenly amongst different social groups (differentiated by social class, ethnicity, gender, age, location, etc.)'. The Sustainable Development Research Network (SDRN) define environmental inequality as follows: 'Environmental inequality refers to the unequal distribution of environmental risks and hazards and access to environmental goods and services.' Gordon Walker (Department of Geography, Lancaster Environment Centre, Lancaster University and Malcolm Eames (University of Cardiff) define 'environmental inequality' as 'covering a wide range of questions of difference or unevenness, including: *Who has good quality and safe environment to live in, who experiences pollution, hazards and risks and who is distanced or protected from such impacts? *Who accesses and consumes environmental resources and who is unable to do so, or limited in their degree of access and consumption? *Who is able to shape environmental decision-making and who is not? Who is included who is excluded?' Sociologist Liam Downey (2005) has distinguished five different ways of defining environmental inequality: i) Intentional racism definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when environmental hazards are intentionally placed in minority neighbourhoods by private companies. ii) Disparate exposure definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more highly exposed to some set of environmental pollutants than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space'. iii) Disparate health impact definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when the negative health effects of residential proximity or exposure to environmental hazards are distributed unequally across social groups.' iv) Disparate social impacts definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise 'when members of a specific social group are more likely to live in environmentally hazardous neighborhoods than we would expect if group members were randomly distributed across residential space.' v) Relative distribution of burdens versus benefits definitions: According to this definition, environmental inequalities arise when groups that receive greater benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means whites and the middle and upper classes) are less burdened by industrial pollution than groups that receive fewer benefits from capitalist social relations (according to proponents of this definition, this means people of colour, the poor and the working classes). =History = The concept of environmental inequality emerged in the context of the movement for Environmental Justice. The Environmental Justice movement originated in the US in the 1980s in response to concerns about communities from poor, black and minority ethnic environments being disproportionately affected by environmental issues and excluded from environmental decision-making.See Schlosberg, David. (2007) Defining Environmental Justice: Theories, Movements, and Nature. Oxford University Press. Much initial progress on promoting an Environmental Justice agenda in the UK was made in Scotland, beginning with a speech made by Jack McConnell, First Minister of the Scottish Executive in 2002. McConnell said: '... the reality is that the people who have the most urgent environmental concerns in Scotland are those who daily cope with the consequences of a poor quality of life, and live in a rotten environment ‚Äì close to industrial pollution, plagued by vehicle emissions, streets filled by litter and walls covered in graffiti. This is true for Scotland and also true elsewhere in the world. These are circumstances which would not be acceptable to better off communities in our society, and those who have to endure such environments in which to bring up a family, or grow old themselves are being denied environmental justice.' Following this speech, and in light of Environmental Justice campaigning by Friends of the Earth Scotland, references to Environmental Justice have been made in several Scottish policy documents ( e.g. Scottish Executive 2002c, 2003, 2003a (the Partnership Agreement); Scottish Executive Development Department, 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2005). The Scottish Executive, in 2005, commissioned research into ways of making environmental information more accessible to the public, and has also recently commissioned a study that investigates the social impacts of flooding. An Environmental Justice agenda has also been emerging in England since the late 1990s. In 1999, Environment Minister Michael Meacher wrote, in a foreword to 'Equality and the Environment' by Brenda Boardman: 'environmental problems are serious and impact most heavily on the most vulnerable members of society: the old, the very young and the poor.' In a 2001 speech, Prime Minister Tony Blair spoke about the need to address environmental issues such as access to green space and air quality in deprived urban areas and in a speech given to the UN in New York, 2007, Prime Minister Gordon Brown said that 'the consequences of climate change will be disproportionately felt by the poorest who are least responsible for it ‚Äì making the issue of climate change one of justice as much as economic development...economic progress social justice and environmental care now go together.' The presence of this agenda became clear at a policy level in England, in DEFRA's 1999 Sustainable Development Strategy 'A Better Life', in which there was a focus on access to environmental information, decision making and justice. The Environmental Justice theme was evident again in the 2004 Sustainable Development Strategy, which commissioned a public consultation on issues around environmental justice and equality. Further, in 2003, the government's Social Exclusion Unit published a report that examined issues around inequalities in transport and pollution. One governmental actor involved in pushing forward the Environmental Justice agenda was The Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. In 2004, it included environmental factors in its indices of deprivation and, in 2005, it commissioned research into the links between social and economic conditions and environmental quality.'Improving the prospects of people living in areas of multiple deprivation in England' (2005) The UK Environmental Justice agenda was also taken on by the government's Sustainable Development Commission (SDC). In their November 2001 review of the UK's Sustainable Development Strategy, SDC approached issues of regeneration, poverty and the environment with an environmental justice perspective, and in their 2002 report 'Vision for Sustainable Regeneration, Environment and Poverty', SDC stressed the need for a new approach to sustainable regeneration that acknowledges the importance of environmental inequalities and the links between poverty and the environment. The discourse around environmental justice in the UK is often framed in terms of 'environmental equality', following DEFRA's decision to use environmental equality as one of its sustainable development indicators. People affected The Environment Agency states that 'People who are socially and economically disadvantaged often live in the worst environments. For example, those living in the most deprived parts of England experience the worst air quality and have less access to green space and adequate housing. These problems can affect people's health and well being and can add to the burden of social and economic deprivation. They can also limit the opportunities available for people to improve their lives and undermine attempts to renew local neighbourhoods. Those affected tend to be the most vulnerable and excluded in society.' There is also evidence that people from BME (black and minority ethnic) backgrounds suffer the worst environmental conditions, and are excluded from environmental decision-making.Agyeman, J., 'Ethnic minorities in Britain: short change, systematic indifference and sustainable development', 2001. UK NGO and think-tank Capacity Global, in 'BMEs ‚Äì Tackling Social and Environmental Justice', argue that several barriers exist, which hinder BAME communities' action on tackling environmental problems. Examples =Access to parks, green spaces and the natural environment= The most affluent 20 per cent of council wards have five times the amount of parks or general green space (excluding gardens) per person than the most deprived 10 per cent of wards. Wards with a population with fewer than 2% black and minority ethnic residents have six times as many parks and eleven times more public green space as wards where more than 40 per cent of the population are people from black and minority ethnic groups. According to a 2011 DEFRA White Paper on the Natural Environment, people in deprived areas are nearly six times less likely than those in affluent ones to describe their area as 'green', and 'those living in deprived areas, minority ethnic communities, elderly people and those with disabilities have less access to green spaces or tend to use them less.' This paper also noted that the frequency of exposure to the natural environment (incorporating a broad array of living things including wildlife, forests, rivers, streams, lakes, seas, countryside, farmed land and urban green space) is 'significantly lower' amongst those aged above 65, BME populations and those on low incomes (members of DE socioeconomic groups). According to the government's Forestry Commission, several factors interact to prevent black and minority ethnic groups from having the same access to woodland as other groups. These are: economic factors; lack of awareness, familiarity, knowledge, confidence or interest; cultural attitudes and preferences; feeling unwelcome and out of place. =Exposure to flood risk= Deprived communities are more exposed to flood risk, with eight times more people in the most deprived 10% of the population living in tidal floodplains than the least deprived 10%. People in deciles 1 and 2 (decile 1 being the most deprived 10% of the population and decile 2 the second most deprived 10%) are 47 per cent more likely to be living at risk of flooding than the rest of the population for zone 2 floodrisk areas, and 62% more likely for zone 3. =Air pollution= The worst levels of air pollution are experienced by people in the most deprived 10% areas in England. These people are also subject to 41% higher concentrations of nitrogen dioxide from transport and industry than the average. The average black or black-British African in the UK person is exposed to 27.25 micrograms per cubic metre of harmful pollutant PM10. This is over 28% higher than the average urban white person. =Exposure to harmful chemicals= A 1999 Friends of the Earth report found that 82% of all carcinogenic chemical emissions were released by factories in the most deprived 20% wards. Further, the report suggested that because 70% of all people from ethnic minorities in the UK live in the 88 most deprived wards, this exposure to harmful chemicals disproportionately affects these people. =Transport-related problems= Over a quarter of child pedestrian casualties happen in the most deprived 10% of wards. In Wales, children and people aged over 65 are twice as likely to be injured by motor vehicles in deprived areas than in more advantaged areas. =Proximity to waste and landfill sites= An investigation by the Environment Agency into Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire revealed that in South Yorkshire, people in decile 1 are twice as likely to be living next to a recycling site, a waste transfer site or a landfill site as the rest of the population and three times more likely to be living near to an amenity site.Environmental Justice in South Yorkshire: Locating Social Deprivation and Poor Environments using Multiple Indicators Fairburn J, Butler B and Smith G, Local Environment Vol. 14 (2) 2009 pp 139 ‚Äì 154 Routledge In the UK as a whole, deprived communities are more likely to live near waste sites except landfill sites, where it is the least deprived populations that are located nearby. =Export of products banned for sale in the UK= Innospec, a company based in Ellesmere Port, is the last remaining manufacturer of tetraethyl lead in the world. The product is banned for general sale in the UK, but has been exported to countries such as Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq and Yemen. The firm has admitted paying bribes to foreign officials. Journalist George Monbiot has argued that Innospec was let off lightly for the bribery and has termed the continued permissiveness in allowing Innospec to export its product as 'environmental racism'. Causes As for the causes of environmental inequalities in the UK, the Environment Agency writes: 'The causes of these inequalities are often complex and long- standing. Some problems are due to the historical location of industry and communities; others are the result of the impacts of new developments such as traffic. Often these environmental problems are caused by the actions of others who do not live in the affected community. Often those most affected have not been involved in the decisions that affect the quality of their environment.' Environmental equity advocates often argue that environmental inequalities are entrenched due to the fact that the vulnerable communities exposed to environmental burdens lack the means necessary to change their situation due to factors such as limited economic means, exclusion from decision-making processes and institutionalised racism. Work being done The UK government has included environmental equality as one of its sustainable development indicators since the establishment of these indicators in 1992. Further, DEFRA have incorporated an environmental inequalities analysis into its work, and the Environment Agency have published several reports on environmental inequality. In Wales, action around environmental inequalities has primarily been coordinated through the Welsh Assembly's Community First initiative, which has attempted to enable deprived communities to take action themselves on sustainable development issues, with a particular focus on health inequalities and the health benefits of access to environmental goods. The Welsh Assembly have recognised the environmental aspects of deprivation, incorporating this into its 2008 index of multiple deprivation. Several UK academics have published widely around environmental inequalities. Academics working on environmental inequalities include Gordon Walker of Lancaster University and Professor Malcolm Eames of Cardiff University.See a paper co-written by Walker and Eames called 'Environmental inequalities : reflections on a transdisciplinary seminar series.' Local Environment, 13 (8). pp. 663-667 In 2006, Brunel University and Lancaster University organised a series of seminars on environmental inequalities. This was supported by the Economic & Social Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council, the Sustainable Development Research Council, the Environment Agency and DEFRA. The following UK NGOs work on issues around environmental inequalities: * Friends of the Earth do some work on issues around environmental justice and inequalities. In 2001, they published a briefing on Environmental Justice with the ESRC and they have also published a report on social exclusion and transport in Bradford. * Friends of the Earth Scotland have a particularly strong focus on environmental justice and have conducted research into and campaigned on inequalities in exposure to air pollution. * Capacity Global are an NGO and think-tank that work on issues around environmental justice and environmental inequality. * The London Sustainability Exchange have worked on environmental inequalities in London. * Groundwork UK, in a report called 'Fair and Green', examine the relationship between environmental problems, deprivation and social justice and focus on the issue of environmental inequalities.

Founded in 2007, it provides a free motorcycle courier service to hospitals in the region, operating a fleet of emergency-equipped motorcycles which are ridden and co-ordinated by volunteers. Severn Freewheelers is a founder-member of the Nationwide Association of Blood Bikes (NABB) and co-operates with similar organisations in the area including Freewheelers EVS (Bristol and Somerset), SERV (south England) and Midland Freewheelers (north-west Birmingham). Operations Severn Freewheelers works for hospitals in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, Worcestershire and north Wiltshire, with its operations extending into southern Birmingham and Coventry. Major hospitals served include Gloucester Royal, Cheltenham General, Hereford County, Worcester Royal, Redditch Alexandra and Swindon Great Western, with many smaller hospitals also served including Tewkesbury, Moreton-in-Marsh, Cinderford, Stroud, Dursley, Cirencester, Ross-on-Wye, Leominster, Bromyard, Ledbury, Kidderminster, Bromsgrove, Malvern, Tenbury Wells, Evesham, Pershore, Chippenham and Savernake. Operating between 7 pm and 7 am on weekdays and 24 hours at weekends and public holidays, the charity provides a service enabling hospitals to avoid the need to use taxis or commercial couriers, saving the NHS an estimated ¬£150,000 each year across the area. By December 2019, the charity had covered over 1,700,000 miles, had responded to more than 46,000 calls, and was receiving over 500 calls each month. Items carried include samples for pathological or micro-biological analysis, blood and blood products for transfusion, patient notes, drugs, scans and medical equipment. Recent developments include the collection of human breast milk from donors‚Äô homes and its transport to human milk banks at Oxford, Bristol and Birmingham, and regular re-supply of blood products to the Midlands Air Ambulance based at Strensham on the M5 as part of the RePHILL clinical trial. During the coronavirus-19 crisis the charity responded by temporarily extending its service to operate 24/7. In addition, some 80 volunteers were recruited from the general public to make home deliveries of medications from general hospitals in Hereford and Gloucestershire. Nearly 3,000 deliveries had been made as of September 2020. Fund-raising In 2011, the charity held its first Prescott Bike Festival at the Prescott Speed Hill Climb circuit near Bishop's Cleeve in Gloucestershire, which attracted 5,000 visitors. This has since become an annual event. It also mounts displays at local shows such as the Three Counties Show, the Cotswold Show, the Emergency Services Show, and local music festivals, and attends motorcycle safety events such as BikeSafe. Several motorcycling celebrities including racers Carl Fogarty and Jamie Whitham have offered to help support the charity in raising funds to support its work.

(31 August 1859 - 15 May 1928) was a British medievalist who made significant contributions to lexicography.  Personal  Robert Jowitt Whitwell was born in August 1859 to Mary Ann Jowitt and Edward Whitwell. The Whitwell family were based in Kendal, where Edward's brother John was the local MP from 1868 to 1880. In April 1884, Robert married Louisa Crommelin Brown, a Glaswegian, with whom he had two daughters and one son. By 1898, they had moved to Oxford, where they lived at 70 Banbury Road, a few doors away from the editor of the OED. In 1914 their younger daughter, Louisa Crommelin Roberta Jowitt Whitwell, married Hastings Russell, the then Marquess of Tavistock, who had studied history at Oxford. Robert died in May 1928, and his wife Louisa died in January 1945.  Academic  In his twenties, while he was still living in Kendal, Whitwell became a prolific voluntary contributor to the OED, submitting some 17,000 quotation slips between 1879 and 1884; by the time the first volume was published in 1888, his slip total was the 7th highest at 33,000. His academic life was, however, based at Oxford University, where he received a B.Litt. from Corpus Christi before becoming associated with New College. In 1901, he was Honorary Secretary of the Oxford Architectural and Historical Society, and in 1907 he was listed as a tutor in Modern History with colleagues including H. W. C. Davis, G. Baskerville, F. Madan, R. L. Poole, R. Rait, and A. L. Smith. Whitwell made his greatest contribution to scholarship in 1913. Frustrated with the standard dictionary of medieval Latin, Du Cange's Glossarium (1678), he petitioned the British Academy to use the third 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies to propose \\"an adequate and complete dictionary of the language, based on the best authorities and compiled on modern scientific principles\\" with the collaboration of \\"historical scholars of all countries\\".Whitwell, Robert Jowitt (1 February 1913). \\"Mediaeval Latin\\", letter to The Spectator. p. 191. The petition was signed by 82 British scholars, including the editors of the OED, and Whitwell was duly allowed to put the proposal to the first plenary session of the Congress, held in the Great Hall of Lincoln's Inn. The American historian J. F. Jameson, reporting on the Congress, warned that the task that Whitwell envisaged \\"could not be hopefully undertaken with resources less formidable than those of the International Union of Academies\\". The First World War made cooperation on such a scale impossible, but it was indeed the IUA who revived Whitwell's suggestion in 1920, and by the time he died in May 1928 a coordinated effort from over ten countries was well under way. His death was noted with regret at the sixth 5-yearly International Congress of Historical Studies by Charles Johnson, who said that Whitwell \\"not only actively promoted the whole [international] scheme but was a zealous member of the committee [on British medieval Latin after 1066] and a generous contributor of excerpts.\\"  References  Category:British medievalists Category:1859 births Category:1928 deaths Category:Contributors to the Oxford English Dictionary ","title":"R.

It is estimated that there are between 30 and 35 million people in Pakistan's current labour force who are engaged in livestocks. While the agricultural practice is prevalent throughout the entire country, it is more common in the fertile provinces of Punjab and Sindh, which are traditionally the main areas of agriculture and farming activity. In 2020, the livestock industry was contributing 60.6 % to overall agriculture and 11.7 % to the GDP. As of 2020, there were approximately 41.2 million buffaloes, 49.6 million cattle, 5.4 million donkeys,78.2 million goats and 30.9 million sheep in Pakistan. Commercial poultry numbered 170.1 million broilers and 10.36 million layers in 1999. There were also 108 million poultry kept and tamed by people. Sheep differ widely throughout the grazing lands of central and northern Pakistan. Their wool is exported in large quantities. Among local cow breeds, the most notable are the Red Sindhi cattle and the Sahiwal Breed, used widely for milk and dairy production purposes. Dung excreted by cattle is a vital resource for supplying cooking fuel and soil fertilizers. The production of dairy product items such as milk, ice cream, cheeses and butter is carried out by dairy plants. During the period of 1984 to 1990, national milk production experienced a 41% increase while meat production surged by 48%. Animals are also widely used for transport in Pakistan, especially in the rural areas; the most commonly used animals are camels, donkeys and bullocks. Challenges faced by modern poultry in Pakistan include high mortality rates and incidences of disease among chicks as well as an inefficient marketing system. The livestock industry still remains neglected and underdeveloped when compared to its full socio-economic potential.Some economic characteristics of animal husbandry in Pakistan: Siddiqi, Akhtar Husain The government of Pakistan has been embarking on various development projects, with the assistance of the Asian Development Bank, to improve the livestock industry and its efficiency.

Aerial view of the station, looking towards the east. Stettbach is a railway station on the north-eastern boundary of the Swiss city of Z√ºrich. Although the station is located just within the city boundary, in the city's Schwamendingen district, it takes its name from the nearby village of Stettbach, which is in the adjacent municipality of D√ºbendorf.  History  Stettbach station, along with the Z√ºrichberg Tunnel and the connecting railway on which the station is situated, were opened in 1990. At the same time Z√ºrich Stadelhofen station was connected by the Hirschengraben Tunnel to new through low level platforms at Z√ºrich Hauptbahnhof, thus creating the through west-east backbone of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn.  Operation  The station is on the Z√ºrichberg line, which links Z√ºrich Stadelhofen station, in central Z√ºrich, with Dietlikon and D√ºbendorf stations. The station has a single platform below ground level, served by two tracks, and at the southern end of the station the railway tracks enter the Z√ºrichberg Tunnel to Z√ºrich Stadelhofen. The station is served by the following lines of the Z√ºrich S-Bahn:  * All lines are operated by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB). Adjacent to the station at ground level are the termini of two of Zurich's tram routes.

The channel operates non-stop 24/7. It is the first and only telenovela channel in the Philippines. It aired its first test broadcast from August to September 2011; regular broadcast started on November 14, 2011. First in Asia, the channel will afford viewers the chance to watch their favorite Televisa- produced Mexican telenovelas anytime of the day. The Telenovela Channel has been made possible through a partnership between Beginnings at Twenty Plus, Inc. and Televisa, which is the exclusive producer and international distributor of telenovelas for this channel. Telenovela Channel is aired on Sky Cable Channel 81, Destiny Cable Channel 81 (Digital) and more than 150 provincial cable television providers nationwide. History =Beginning of the broadcast of telenovelas in the Philippines= During the 90s, The Philippines started to air Latin American telenovelas on free TV networks such as RPN 9 (since 1994 with La Traidora), ABS-CBN 2 (since 1996 with Maria Mercedes), ABC 5 (later TV5, now 5) (since 1996 with Morena Clara) and GMA 7 (since 1996 with Agujetas de color de rosa). The telenovelas aired on Philippine TV, especially those produced in Mexico, were dubbed in Tagalog and were shown in primetime slots. However, the late 2000s saw the dwindling popularity of the Latin American telenovelas as Asianovelas (especially those the Korean-produced dramas) became more popular. =Channel Launch and Initial Programming (2011-2013)= Beginnings at 20 Plus, Inc. launched a channel dedicated to Mexican telenovelas in 2011. Beginnings at 20 Plus, Inc. is a multi-media company that produces concerts, events and offers television production services as well. The company produced the dubbed Tagalog version of the Chinese historical drama series Judge Bao in 2007‚Äì2008, aired on ABC-5. A landmark agreement between Beginnings at 20 Plus, Inc. and Mexican network Televisa marked the start of a new channel dedicated to telenovelas. On November 14, 2011, Telenovela Channel started its maiden broadcast with In the Name of Love, The Two Sides of Ana, Passion and La Madrastra. These telenovelas were dubbed in Tagalog and were aired in original Spanish audio as well until 2013 as the new telenovelas were dubbed in English. The year 2012 saw the introduction of new telenovelas as well. These are A Woman's Word, Big Love, and Love Spell. The same year also marked the return of Marimar, this time on cable via this channel. With its aim to be a purely Filipino telenovela cable channel, Spanish audio versions of the telenovelas were stopped in order to give way to Tagalog dubbed shows. On August 13 to 19, 2012, episodes of various telenovelas were aired again by viewers' request due to brownouts caused by strong monsoon rains (Habagat) on August 7‚Äì9, 2012. =Transition to English Audio and Programming Changes (2013-2016)= In 2013 the channel made a major shift as the new telenovelas acquired are now dubbed in English starting with Soy tu due√±a and Rafaela. In June 2013, the channel's airtime was reduced to give way to Home TV shopping blocktimer TeleVShop which was later replaced by TV Shop Philippines in 2014. On June 2, 2014, the telenovela returned on Free TV as The Two Sides of Ana (Dalawang Mukha ni Ana) during ATC @ IBC-13 block. On July 7, 2014, Telenovela Channel launched the return of the popular telenovela Cuidado con el √°ngel, under the english title Don't Mess with an Angel. The said telenovela already aired on ABS-CBN as Maria de Jesus: Ang Anghel sa Lansangan, dubbed in Tagalog from 2009 until it ended in 2010. Also in 2014, reruns of last 5-10 episodes of each telenovela were aired, afterwards a new telenovela was replaced. As of 2015, no full- length reruns of telenovelas aired after the rerun of The One who Couldn't Love. From April 2015 to present, all telenovelas and an anthology are aired in English. =Exploring New Genres & Remakes to Pandemic Programming Interruption (2017-present)= On January 16, 2017, Telenovela Channel aired its first non-telenovela program \\"The Rose of Guadalupe\\" an anthology featuring standalone inspirational stories each episode. Three new novelas subsequently aired on summer: Head Over Heels, I Don't Trust Men Anymore and La Malquerida. For the first time, Telenovela Channel launched its first Brazilian telenovela Carrossel, which is a remake of the 1989 telenovela Carrusel. The telenovela, produced by SBT and distributed by Televisa (for international markets), replaced I Don't Trust Men Anymore on October 23, 2017. With 252 episodes using the international version (instead of 310 in the original airing), this is the overall longest running telenovela aired on TNC, although Big Love (2012-2013) remains the longest running Mexican soap opera with 205 episodes. Two programs premiered on New Year's Day of 2018: My Heart is Yours and The Color of Passion. I Don't Trust Men Anymore had its repeat broadcast in July 2018, first program to have a full run rerun since The One Who Couldn't Love in 2015. Secrets at the Hotel was launched on September 3, 2017 replacing La Rosa de Guadalupe.This is the second period soap opera the channel aired after Passion in 2011. Simply Mar√≠a, a remake of the 1989 telenovela (already aired on RPN from 1996-1997), was launched on September 17, 2018. Fooled Into Love and Ask God for Forgiveness Not Me premiered in late November as 2018 draws to an end. Telenovela Channel aired the program Coraz√≥n indomable under the title Wild at Heart in January 2019. The said telenovela was already shown on GMA Network in 2015, with a slightly reduced number of episodes along with Tagalog audio. This is the third time a previously Tagalog-dubbed telenovela on free TV will be aired in English on TNC after Don't Mess with an Angel and Rubi. Wild at Heart is based on the 1994 telenovela Marimar which was broadcast on TNC in 2012. Alongside with it is the launch of The Stray Cat, which is produced by Nathallie Lartilleux, the same producer of Wild at Heart. On June 2019, Telenovela Channel premiered three telenovelas on the same day: The Three Sides of Ana, Las Amazonas and Unforgivable. In September 2019, Telenovela Channel aired telenovelas The Neighbor and Passion and Power which was the last telenovela that famous actor Fernando Colunga starred in Televisa. In January 2020, three new programs premiered: Anything But Plain, Shadows of the Past and Along Came Love. Due to the Enhanced Community Quarantine imposed by the Philippine government, as a preventive measure to the COVID -19 Pandemic , office operations were affected and thus the channel was forced to air reruns from April to June 2020 except Passion and Power which finished its broadcast in early April followed by a rerun of the program's last few weeks until May. By July 2020, TeleNovela Channel resumed regular programming with new episodes .

Its last was assigned to the 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, stationed at Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina. It was inactivated on 18 March 1969. History Activated in October 1957 at George AFB, California. Initially equipped with F-100 Super Sabres, however was programmed to receive the new F-104C tactical strike version of the Lockheed Starfighter. Delays in development caused the squadron not to receive the F-104 until September 1958, when it was the first Tactical Air Command squadron to be equipped with the new aircraft. It was primarily intended for nuclear strike, but it could also carry out ground attack missions with conventional weapons. After obtaining operational readiness with the Starfigher, was deployed to Spain for air defense missions over the SAC B-47 Reflex base at Moron AB. Also used by the USAF/Lockheed for demonstrations for NATO military sales to replace Republic F-84F Thunderstreak combat aircraft. Also deployed in this role to Hahn AB, West Germany in 1962. Was deployed to Taiwan in 1968 to reinforce the ROC Air Force air defense mission. In April 1968 was forward deployed with regular rotations to Da Nang Air Base, South Vietnam. Their job was to fly MiG combat air patrol (MiGCAP) missions to protect American fighter bombers against attack by North Vietnamese fighters. They flew these missions armed with their single M61A1 20-mm cannon and four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles. The effect of F-104 deployment upon NVN and PRC MiG operations was immediate and dramatic; NVN MiGs soon learned to avoid contact with USAF strikes being covered by F-104s. During the entire deployment of the 476th only two fleeting encounters between F-104Cs and enemy fighters occurred. Returned to the United States without aircraft in July 1968, the F-104Cs remaining in Taiwan and sold to the ROC Air Force. Was planned to be re-equipped with F-4C Phantom IIs as part of the phaseout of the F-104 from TAC, however budget reductions led to the squadron being placed on non-operational status; personnel were re-designated as the 4535th Combat Crew Training Squadron. Was reassigned to 4th TFW at Seymour Johnson AFB, but remained non-operational and inactivated in March 1969. = Lineage= * Established as 476th Fighter-Day Squadron on 1 October 1957 : Activated on 8 October 1957 : Re-designated as 476th Tactical Fighter Squadron on 1 July 1958 : Inactivated on 18 March 1969 =Assignments= * 479th Fighter-Day (later Tactical Fighter) Wing: 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1968 : Attached to: 65th Air Division, 12 Nov 1959 ‚Äì 28 Mar 1960 : Attached to: 65th Air Division, 8 Apr ‚Äì 17 Aug 1961 : Attached to: 50th Tactical Fighter Wing, 8 Apr-l0 Aug 1962 : Attached to: 65th Air Division, 6 Jan-l Apr 1964 : Attached to: 2d Air Division, 7 Apr ‚Äì 11 Jul 1968 : In non-operational status, 11 July ‚Äì 25 September 1958 * 4th Tactical Fighter Wing, 25 September 1968 ‚Äì 18 March 1969 (Not manned or equipped) =Stations= * George Air Force Base, California, 8 October 1957 ‚Äì 25 September 1968 : Deployed to: Mor√≥n Air Base, Spain, 12 Nov 1959 ‚Äì 28 Mar 1960; 8 Apr ‚Äì 17 Aug 1961; 6 Jan-l Apr 1964 : Deployed to: Hahn Air Base, West Germany, 8 Apr-l0 Aug 1962 : Deployed to: Ching Chuan Kang Air Base, Taiwan, 7 Apr ‚Äì 11 Jul 1968 :: Performed rotational deployments to Da Nang AB, South Vietnam * Seymour Johnson AFB, North Carolina, 25 September 1968 ‚Äì 18 March 1969 =Aircraft= * F-100 Super Sabre, 1957-1958 * F-104C Starfigher, 1958-1968  References * Ravenstein, Charles A.

It originally aired on AMC in the United States on November 13, 2011. In the episode, Daryl Dixon (Norman Reedus), delusional from being wounded in a search mission, desperately tries to return to the Greene farm. Meanwhile, Glenn (Steven Yeun) unravels a secret that could endanger the survivors. Plot In the opening flashback, Lori (Sarah Wayne Callies) and Shane (Jon Bernthal), escaping to a refugee center at the onset of the walker epidemic, watch in horror as military helicopters drop napalm on Atlanta. In the present, the survivors continue their search for the missing Sophia. Hershel (Scott Wilson) expresses his concern to Rick (Andrew Lincoln) that his group has gotten too comfortable on his farmlands. Hershel is particularly concerned on how close Glenn (Steven Yeun) and his daughter Maggie (Lauren Cohan) appear to be. Meanwhile, Glenn accidentally learns Lori is pregnant, and she asks him to keep it a secret from Rick. During a search party, Shane tells Rick the search is pointless and they should continue on to Fort Benning. Rick later confides in Lori that Shane may be right. Lori privately confronts Shane, reminding him that her and Carl's (Chandler Riggs) well-being are no longer his problem. Daryl (Norman Reedus) goes out on horseback searching for Sophia, eventually coming across her doll in a river bed. As he follows the river, a snake frightens his horse and he is thrown, and is severely wounded by one of his crossbow bolts in the fall. He starts to hallucinate his missing brother Merle (Michael Rooker), who berates him for spending more time searching for Sophia than him. Daryl wakes in time to find a walker chewing on his shoe; he quickly dispatches it and another approaching walker, and takes their ears as a trophy necklace. Daryl limps towards the farm, and from a distance, is mistaken as a walker; Andrea (Laurie Holden) inadvertently shoots him, grazing his head and knocking him unconscious. Rick reaches Daryl first, and hides the walker ear necklace before Hershel can see it. Daryl is treated and when he wakes, tells Carol (Melissa McBride) what he had found, for which she is grateful. Carol and Lori attempt to repay Hershel for his hospitality by cooking dinner, but tensions remain high. Maggie discretely passes Glenn a note asking him when they can have sex again. However, both Hershel and Dale Horvath (Jeffrey DeMunn) witness this. Glenn writes a reply and returns the note. After dinner, Maggie reads Glenn's reply and is horrified as he promised to wait in the barn for her. She rushes to try to stop him but is too late as Glenn discovers the barn is filled with walkers. Production Michael Rooker made a guest appearance on the show. \\"Chupacabra\\" was directed by Guy Ferland and written by David Leslie Johnson. The episode features the return of Michael Rooker as Merle Dixon, who last made an appearance on the season one episode \\"Tell It to the Frogs\\". Rooker confirmed his appearance at the 2011 Aliens to Zombies Convention at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood, California. \\"Nobody expected this level of Merle worship,\\" he articulated. \\"He's such an out- there, crazy, anything goes kind of guy. There's an uncertainty about Merle‚Äîlike he'll come back when you least expect it. He's the boogeyman, and viewers love that suspense. The number one question I'm asked is, 'When is your character coming back?' I can't say when, but I promise it‚Äôll be a wild ride.\\" Writer Robert Kirkman insisted that Rooker was a delight during production, and hoped that he would regularly appear on The Walking Dead. \\"Chupacabra\\" further analyzes the development of Daryl Dixon. In the episode, Daryl continues to search for Sophia; eventually he lies deliriously on a riverbank, where he simultaneously hallucinates his missing brother Merle.

Rechter Terror in Deutschland by Christian Fuchs and John Goetz, published by Rowohlt, 2012. =Political development= Around the time of the reunification of Germany in 1990, the politics around Zsch√§pe were in turmoil and, in contrast to official GDR propaganda, racism was already widespread.Belinda Cooper, The Fall of the Wall and the East German Police National Justice Reference Service, 1996 Aged 14, Zsch√§pe joined a youth gang which called itself Die Zecken (\\"The Ticks\\"). Although the group considered itself politically leftist, there were also completely non-politically oriented members. When Die Zecken planned to attack a meeting of young right- extremists and beat a few of them up, she tagged along. Otherwise she is described at the time as just wanting to enjoy life, only seldom expressing herself politically, and as having a liking for the magazine Bravo (illegal in East Germany). Her involvement with the political right began around 1991. She met Uwe Mundlos, the son of a computer science professor at the Jena University of Applied Sciences who arrived in Winzerla with his family just before the fall of the Berlin Wall. She formed a relationship with him and entered Jena's neo-Nazi underground, coming into contact with the national and international neo-Nazi network. Uwe B√∂hnhardt, whose parents were a teacher and an engineer, became a close friend of theirs.\\"Cats and Camper Vans: The Bizarrely Normal Life of the Neo-Nazi Terror Cell\\", Spiegel Online International, 23 February 2012.

She said that she was the person they had been looking for and that she was the reason why the whole city had been closed off. However, the policeman who had answered the call did not recognize her and said he did not know anything about such a case. A few hours later, Zsch√§pe herself arrived with her lawyer at the police station in Jena.Guten Tag, hier ist Beate Zsch√§pe\\": Polizist erkennt Rechtsterroristin nicht, Augsburger Allgemeine 23 January 2012 Since 8 November 2011, she has been held in custody. On 11 November 2011, the Office of the Attorney General of Germany began investigating Zsch√§pe's then alleged membership of a terrorist unit.Press release 35/2011, Attorney General of Germany, 11 November 2011. On 8 November 2012, one year after the series of murders became known, the Office of the Attorney General pressed charges against Zsch√§pe and four alleged supporters. As a founding member of the NSU, she was accused of having taken part in the murders of eight fellow citizens of Turkish origin and one fellow citizen of Greek origin, in the murderous attack on two police officers in Heilbronn, as well as in the attempted murders by bomb attacks of the NSU in the historic district of Cologne and in Cologne-M√ºlheim.Press release 32/2012 Attorney General of Germany, 8 November 2012. According to the charges, the NSU was a group of three members with equal rights who committed their crimes after having coordinated their division of labour. In this process, Zsch√§pe is said to have had the indispensable task of giving the existence of such a terrorist unit the appearance of normality and legality by, among other things, maintaining an inconspicuous fa√ßade at their respective places of residence and by securing their joint flat as a safe haven and headquarters for their actions. In addition, she is said to have been \\"significantly responsible for the logistics of the group\\". In a fingerprint analysis, evidence of Zsch√§pe's DNA is said to have been found on newspaper articles about the bomb attack in Cologne and the murder of Habil Kilic. In addition, Zsch√§pe is accused of having set the flat in Zwickau on fire, hereby having rendered herself liable for prosecution for the attempted murder of a neighbour and two craftsmen as well as for particularly serious arson.Sie hatte die Jungs im Griff, Tagesschau, 8 November 2012. The department of public prosecution in Zwickau also investigated her because child pornography had been found on her computer. However, this investigation was said to have been closed, since the penalty for this would be of \\"no significant weight\\" in comparison to the penalty for the actions of which she had already been accused.\\"Besitz von Kinderpornografie: Staatsanwaltschaft ermittelte gegen Zsch√§pe\\", Spiegel Online Panorama, 12 February 2013. In February 2013, 60-year-old Annerose Zsch√§pe told Focus that she thought her daughter was being prejudged and that her position was not being considered objectively. She said that part of a statement she had made to police was misrepresented in the press or taken out of context. She said there was a lot she would like to see put straight, but she did not want to say more before the trial commenced.Meine Tochter ist vorverurteilt Focus, 3 February 2013.

Although she was involved with some of their members, she herself was not a member and disapproved of their actions. She apologised to victims' families, saying that she felt morally guilty that she could not prevent the murders and bomb attacks carried out by Uwe Mundlos and Uwe B√∂hnhardt. Few took her apology seriously or accepted it. Bild ran a headline stating that: \\"Zsch√§pe's confession - nothing but excuses!\\" In September 2017, the prosecutors demanded that life imprisonment is to be imposed on Zsch√§pe as punishment for her crimes. On 11 July 2018, Zsch√§pe was found guilty of ten counts of murder, membership in a terror organization, and arson, and sentenced to life imprisonment without ordinary parole.\\"Neo-Nazi NSU member Beate Zsch√§pe found guilty of murder, sentenced to life in prison\\", Deutsche Welle, 11 July 2018.

IDD/BDA (1931‚Äì2007) Born in Roskilde, Kastholm first trained as a smith but soon turned to furniture design. He attended the School for Interior Design in Copenhagen where he studied under Finn Juhl. At the beginning of the 1960s, working in Lebanon, he was inspired to design the Scimitar Chair. He also furnished the SAS office there.\\"M√∏beldesigner J√∏rgen Kastholm er d√∏d 76 √•r gammel\\", R-Randers.dk, 15 June 2007. Retrieved 14 November 2011. It was while studying at the Design School that Kastholm met cabinetmaker Preben Fabricius who became his partner for a number of years. They had a common approach to furniture design, never wanting to compromise on quality. Speaking of their partnership, Kastholm commented: \\"We had the same basic approach, we both wanted to minimize. I had been to the United States and seen furniture by Eames and Mies van der Rohe and it inspired us. The simplest lasts longest. At school we had learnt that timelessness was an ideal.\\" In 1961, the pair set up a design studio in a Gentofte cellar without any firm arrangements with manufacturers. In 1965, they exhibited at the furniture fair in Fredericia where the German furniture manufacturer Alfred Kill noticed their work. Kill had a reputation for high quality but initially Favricius and Kastholm were not keen to design furniture for factory production. Only when Kill offered them DM 2,500 a month each, with no preconditions, did they agree to work for him.Dorte Mosb√¶k, \\"J√∏rgen Kastholm og Preben Fabricius\\" , BoBedre. Retrieved 13 November 2011. They travelled to Stuttgart with their first designs for production in Kill's factory in nearby Fellbach. Their international breakthrough came at the Cologne Fair in 1966 when they exhibited a whole series of office and home furniture leading to orders from ten large furniture concerns. Their minimalistic designs, both attractive and comfortable, were usually in steel and leather. The Tulip Chair FK 6725, the Grasshopper Chair FK 87 and the Scimitar Chair are among their most successful works.Signe Brogaard, \\"Preben Fabricius og J√∏rgen Kastholm\\" , Bo Bedre.

Kastholm was later appointed professor at Bergische Universit√§t in Wuppertal near D√ºsseldorf where he taught design from 1975 to 1996. He also designed furniture at his office in Germany as well as in his house in the mountains on the island of Majorca.

Biography Kuroda was born in Yanagawa, Fukuoka and graduated from the 21st class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in 1909 and the 29th class of the Army Staff College in 1916. HIs classmates included Tomoyuki Yamashita and Shizuichi Tanaka. From 1917 to 1918, he was with Japanese forces assigned to the Siberian intervention, during which time he was promoted to captain. In 1922, Kuroda served as military attach√© in England and was promoted to major. From 1935-1937, he served as military attach√© in British India. In 1937, he was promoted to major general and given command of the IJA 26th Division. =Battle of Wuyuan= Kuroda commanded the IJA 26th Division in the Battle of Wuyuan in the Second Sino-Japanese War. The battle, which was part of the Japanese counterattack in response to the Chinese 1939-40 Winter Offensive, resulted to a Chinese victory and Japanese retreat.(Original from the University of Michigan)(Original from the University of Michigan) The Japanese call it Á¨¨ÔºíÊ¨°ÂæåÂ•ó‰ΩúÊà¶ (English:The second battle of Wuyuan). Despite the loss in the said battle, the Japanese had a strategic victory for making the Chinese fail their primary objectives. (article about the Winter Offensive) =Pacific War= In 1941, with the start of the Pacific War, Kuroda was appointed Deputy Inspector General for Military Training, which was then under General Otoz≈ç Yamada. From July 1, 1942 to May 19, 1943, he was Chief of Staff of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army Group. =Philippines= From May 28, 1943 to September 26, 1944, Kuroda was made military governor of the Philippines, succeeding Shizuichi Tanaka in the said post. He later became the first Commander in Chief of the Japanese Fourteenth Area Army, which were the merged elements of the Japanese 14th Army, 35th Army and 41st Army, in the Philippines from July 28 to September 26, 1944. During his rule in the Philippines, a constitution was formed by the Preparatory Commission for Independence, consisting of 20 members from the KALIBAPI. The Preparatory Commission, led by Jos√© P. Laurel, presented its draft Constitution on September 4, 1943 and three days later, the KALIBAPI general assembly ratified the draft Constitution. By September 20, 1943, the KALIBAPI's representative groups in the country's provinces and cities elected from among themselves fifty-four members of the Philippine National Assembly, the legislature of the country, with fifty-four governors and city mayors as ex officio members. Three days after establishing the National Assembly, the Second Philippine Republic's inaugural session was held at the pre-war Legislative Building and it elected by majority Benigno S. Aquino as its first Speaker and Jos√© P. Laurel as President of the Republic of the Philippines, who was inaugurated on October 14, 1943 at the foundation of the Republic. =American return and postwar life= Shigenori Kuroda (center) with his predecessor as Governor General of the Philippines Masaharu Honma (left) and a US military policeman (right) in September 1945. By early 1944, the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff anticipated the return of American forces to the Philippines.The weight for preparing against an American landing fell to Kuroda. Kuroda planned to concentrate the bulk of the Japanese forces in Luzon, but his plan was never considered by the Imperial Army General Staff. The staff instead devoted only five of his ten divisions in Luzon, which was said to have no experience in any of the past Japanese campaigns. After being denied of his ideas for the defense of the Philippines, he was accused to have been lax in his duties and was replaced by Tomoyuki Yamashita, his former schoolmate in the Army War College, who was touted as a \\"superb and excellent tactician\\", after the fall of his patron Hideki Tojo from power. Kuroda returned to Japan in disgrace in October 1944 and entered the reserves in December of the same year. After the surrender of Japan, Kuroda was arrested by American occupation authorities in 1946 and held in Yokohama Prison. In October 1947, he was extradited to the Republic of the Philippines during the Manila Trials was and condemned to life imprisonment as a Class B war criminal due to Command responsibility for the actions of his troops in the Philippines. His lawyer at the time was Lieutenant Colonel Jose Lukban. He disguised Kuroda by putting a mole on his face, and removing that at the end of the trial to discredit the witnesses thrown at the Japanese general. He was pardoned in 1952 by Philippine president Elpidio Quirino and repatriated to Japan, where he died the same year. Kuroda's chief defense counsel was Pedro A. Serran, Col. USAFFE who was named the \\"Liberator of Zarraga, Panay Island\\". Ironically Col. Serran as commissioned officer practicing Lawyer fought the enemy in warfighting as Captain leading attacking the Japanese garrisons and collecting intelligence for US military's return, a professional lawyer believing in democracy and due process, became the chief attorney who presented Kuroda's defense. Col. Serran was anti-corruption and became a US citizen after the war, he died at age 86 in the San Francisco bay area.Book was published by Cambridge University Press by Yuma Totani from the University of Hawaii on page 213 and other pages of \\"Justice in Asia and the Pacific Region 1945-1952 Allied War Crimes Prosecutions\\". The book stated that Kuroda was too ill and could not speak who wrote for 31 weeks of court trials. Kuroda's court trials were the longest trial out of the Japanese army leader trials, Honma and Yamashita lasted only 8 to 9 weeks before a verdict and other Japanese officers even shorter time verdict.https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/justice-in-asia-and-the-pacific- region-19451952/45766BA2A9330B928C8A35529179A812 Justice in Asia and the Pacific Region, 1945‚Äì1952 Allied War Crimes Prosecutions Yuma Totani, University of Hawaii, HiloPublisher: Cambridge University Press.

History and words  Bach wrote the cantata in his first year in Leipzig for the 22nd Sunday after Trinity. The prescribed readings for the Sunday were from the Epistle to the Philippians, thanks and prayer for the congregation in Philippi (), and from the Gospel of Matthew, the parable of the unforgiving servant (). The unknown poet of the cantata text stressed the opposites of the gospel, God's justice versus unjust men. The text begins with a related quotation from the prophet Hosea, . The next two movements, recitative and aria, reflect the sinful condition of man, another set of recitative and aria deals with God's mercy. The closing chorale is stanza 7 of \\"\\" by Johann Heermann (1630), which Bach would treat completely one year later in his chorale cantata Wo soll ich fliehen hin, BWV 5. Bach first performed the cantata on 24 October 1723.  Scoring and structure  The cantata in six movements is scored for three vocal soloists (soprano, alto and bass), a four-part choir only in the chorale, horn, two oboes, two violins, viola, and basso continuo. # Aria (bass): # Recitative (alto): # Aria (alto): # Recitative (soprano): # Aria (soprano): # Chorale:  Music  The cantata is scored like chamber music. Only the chorale is set for four parts; the alto voice sings of man's sin, the soprano of God's grace, and the bass is God's voice in the opening movement. On some copies of the parts, the movement is marked aria but we don't know if that marking is authorized by Bach. Formally it has some characteristics of an aria, such as a ritornello to open the movement and frame the text sections, and some aspects of an arioso, for example the free setting of the sections. The last section, which speaks of God's \\"\\" (too fervent mercy) is embedded in the ritornello, then the ritornello is repeated once more. One motif in the ritornello is similar to one in the chorus \\"\\" from Bach's St John Passion and may illustrate undecidedness in both cases. The following three movements, two recitatives and an expressive aria, are only accompanied by the continuo, the last aria also by an obbligato oboe. The closing chorale is set for four parts; the melody in the soprano is doubled by the horn, the oboes, and violin I.  Recordings  * J. S.

He is also the public address announcer for the Londonderry High School football games. In a 2012 radio interview during the gubernatorial primary, his characterization of his professional experience was, \\"my background is in marketing and public relations.\\" Professional career =Town Manager= After a year-long search, Smith was appointed Town Manager of Londonderry NH in August 2013.http://patch.com/new- hampshire/londonderry/report-kevin-smith-to-be-named-londonderry-town- manager#.U9zmP4BdV5s The Town Manager position is responsible for the proper administration of all departments of town government, except the Library Division. In this capacity, the Smith is responsible for proposing and executing the town's budget.http://www.londonderrynh.org/Pages/LondonderryNH_Manager/index Smith has been particularly focused on growing the Londonderry economic base. An expansion of the town's infrastructure for the industrially zoned area has yielded particularly strong results. The Pettengill Road project has been one of Smith's larger and more substantial areas of focus in his first year in the role. Within the industrial area of town, a Pratt & Whitney and UPS funded project is expected to bring over 150 jobs in its first year and could swell to 500 jobs.http://www.eagletribune.com/newhampshire/x2117410105/UPS-Pratt- Whitney-announce-big-plans Separately, FedEx is expanding to add several hundred jobs in a new 300,000 square foot facility in the same area and bring another 500 jobs. On the residential and retail side of the equation, Smith has been actively focusing on the conversion of Londonderry's Woodmont Orchards into the planned community of Woodmont Commons. This project is anticipated to bring over 1,000 homes, commercial and retail space over the next several years http://www.unionleader.com/article/20140526/NEWS02/140529282/0/SEARCH According to Business NH Magazine, Londonderry is \\"poised to become an economic powerhouse.\\"http://millyardcommunications.com/index.php?src=news&refno;=4122&category;=News =State legislature= Smith was elected as a state legislator from Londonderry, NH to the New Hampshire House of Representatives from 1996‚Äì98, where he served on the Judiciary and Family Law Committee. In 1997 he spoke for the members of the Committee opposed to SB 34, an act repealing statutes that required prison terms and fines for physicians who performed abortions and repealing a statute that mandated a charge of murder against physicians whose patients died in the course of an abortion procedure. He stated that passage of the bill and consequent repeal of those laws might cause New Hampshire to \\"become the abortion mecca of the country\\" and referred to it as an \\"extreme measure\\". The bill passed the legislature and was signed into law by then-governor Jeanne Shaheen, decriminalizing those activities for physicians. In 1997 he authored HB 768, a bill banning partial birth abortion which was defeated in the House. In that year he also voted in favor of Right- to-work legislation. In 1998 he was awarded the Christian Coalition's \\"Pro- Family\\" House Member of the Year. During his time of service in the legislature, Smith was the director of a before and after-school child care program and also worked as an elementary school para-professional, assisting students with special needs. =U.S. Senate and governor's office= He served on the official staffs for both former United States Senator, Bob Smith (no relation ) and New Hampshire Governor, Craig Benson. Senator Smith and Governor Benson both lost their bids for re-election prompting him to joke that after Benson's defeat he \\"started to feel a little bit like the Typhoid Mary of political campaigns.\\" Smith had also served as the New Hampshire campaign field director for Senator Smith's unsuccessful bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 1999. During his time as a US Senate staffer, Smith was the outreach liaison to New Hampshire's law enforcement and public safety community, as well as a caseworker where he assisted New Hampshire's citizens on a variety of matters such as veteran's affairs, social security, and immigration. While serving on the Governor's staff, Smith was the Governor's liaison to the Executive Branch Department Heads as well as New Hampshire's Executive Council, where Smith assisted with appointments to Executive Branch Boards, Commissions, and Departments. Smith also served on the Interagency Commission to End Homelessness during his time in the Governor's Office although he has said that he considers it a tragedy when \\"government steps in the role of charitable organizations, of faith-based organizations, of community organizations that do such a great job of helping out people in the community. They've basically outsourced all of the roles that churches and charities used to do to the government and that's a real shame. We need to get back to looking at our community organizations as a first line of defense and not the government.\\". =Division for Juvenile Justice Services= In 2005, Smith joined the New Hampshire Division of Juvenile Justice Services where he became Assistant Director of the Department in 2007. During his tenure, Kevin oversaw the Finance and Quality Assurance departments and helped develop the Division's first \\"report card\\" which measured the results and efficacy of various programs within the Division. Kevin was also a member of the New Hampshire Chiefs of Police and worked closely with law enforcement and District Court judges on matters such as developing alternatives to juvenile detention and reducing the incidence of disproportionate minority contact in urban areas. Kevin also worked closely with the Commissioner of Health and Human Services to develop the state's first Office of Faith-based and Community Programs as a means to find local, community and private-sector solutions to meet the needs of New Hampshire's most vulnerable citizens when state resources were not available. =Cornerstone= In 2009, Smith became Executive Director of Cornerstone Action, a non-partisan, conservative advocacy organization dedicated to the advancement of free-enterprise, limited government, and personal responsibility policies in the state legislature. During the three years of his executive directorship the organization's membership increased from 2,000 to 8,000. Smith has stated that revenue increased ten-fold to a high of $1.2 million in 2010 during his tenure however the organization's 2010 federal tax filings, not submitted until a month after his resignation in 2011, show gross revenue of only $51,470 for that year of which $40,522 went to his salary. Along with other expenses this represented a yearly loss of $21,505 despite a substantial reduction in his salary from $65,769 in 2009. For his efforts, Smith has been recognized by national and local mediahttp://nhjournal.com/2010/12/19/meet-\\"the-new-hampshire-50\\"/ as being one of the most influential conservatives in New Hampshire and in 2011, was named by Business NH Magazine as one of New Hampshire's \\"10 Most Powerful People.\\" =2012 campaign= Smith resigned as an Executive Director of Cornerstone in October 2011 to run as a Republican candidate in the 2012 New Hampshire gubernatorial election. He lost in the primary but did receive 30% of the vote to victor Ovide Lamontagne's 68%. Personal Born in Winchester, MA to Bruce and Denise Smith, Kevin moved to New Hampshire when his family moved to Londonderry in 1986. A graduate of Londonderry High School and the University of New Hampshire at Manchester, Smith was appointed to the New Hampshire Advisory Committee to the US Commission on Civil Rights in 2009 and continues to serve on the Committee. He is currently the President of Smith Enterprises, a government and public relations consulting group. Smith currently resides in Litchfield with his wife, Suzy Fawcett Smith, and their three children Colby, Lindsay and Tommy. In The News James Pindell, WMUR Political Scoop: > With his ability to build coalitions around an ad hoc tax rally this week, > Smith showed Cornerstone is not just about social issues and that he is > becoming a real serious player.

He's > shown that he can bring the firepower when needed. Conservative Group Leader Disarms Foes, Concord Monitor (May 10, 2009): =Views on issues=  Tax issues  Along with all other major candidates besides Democrat Jacalyn Cilley Smith has made The Pledge to veto state sales or income taxes.  Education reform  Smith has stated that he believes that the public school system is still based upon a 1950s model and needs to be reformed and that the government should issue educational vouchers that would provide tax revenue to private schools, enabling parents to more affordably send their children to private schools. However he says that speaking as a product of public schools himself and because most children are educated within the public school system, we can't give up on that system. He has also spoken in favor of grade retention, saying \\"we shouldn't move kids up the chain until they reach their grade level.\\" = Education funding = In the context of the ongoing school funding issues of New Hampshire, Smith says that he agrees with current Governor John Lynch that there should be a constitutional amendment allowing the state to target aid to the neediest communities but believes that it is a notable failure of leadership that the Governor has not delivered this solution as he promised in his 2004 campaign.  Death penalty  Although not always in favor of it, Smith said that he has \\"evolved\\" and is currently endorses the death penalty for some crimes.  Health and Human Services  Smith has said that there is a problem with corruption in the New Hampshire Department of Health & Human Services and when asked how it should be addressed he said, \\"You need to have competent people to do the job.\\"  Second Amendment issues  New Hampshire law requires a license to carry a loaded firearm in both open or concealed fashion while in a motor vehicle but no license is needed to openly carry a loaded weapon while on foot. Regarding the carrying of firearms in public, Smith said in early 2012 that he is \\"on the fence, but leaning toward keeping the law the way it is.\\"  Federal Funding for Abortion  In addition to Smith's activity regarding abortion while serving in the legislature, he has said that \\"People don't want public funding for abortion clinics. It's an issue that cuts across party lines.\\"  Infrastructure  Smith has stated that the most important transportation issue currently is the expansion and widening of Interstate 93. Regarding establishment of commuter rail service to connect Southern New Hampshire with the Boston-area rail system he says that studies he has read indicate that expected ridership levels would be insufficient to support profitability and that hence along with the other expenses involved he does not believe that New Hampshire can afford such an endeavor at the present time, however this is not an absolute position and he would be willing to listen to the arguments of rail advocates.
