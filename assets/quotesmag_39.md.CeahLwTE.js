History  √âcole des arts industriels et des mines (√âcole Centrale de Lille) was a college of engineering founded in Lille in 1854 during the Second French Empire. On the eve of the French Third Republic, lectures and research activities were reorganised into a comprehensive three-year curriculum and developed in 1872, embodied by its newly built Institut industriel du Nord de la France (IDN). Education initially focused on civil engineering, mechanical engineering, chemistry and manufacturing engineering. Electrical engineering full courses were added in 1892, automobile design has been taught from 1899 onwards. More than 200 students graduated in year 1914. Aerodynamics studies started in 1930. A focus on automatic control and computers was initiated in 1957. Later came courses and research in computer science, supply chain management, materials science, micro-electronics and telecommunications. Since early 20th century, student admission has been based on a competitive exam after attending a classe pr√©paratoire aux grandes √©coles or similar undergraduate studies. The Institut industriel du Nord was originally located in Lille central district until 1875. Larger buildings with dedicated laboratories were inaugurated in 1875 nearby the Facult√© des sciences de Lille. It then moved in 1968 in the modern campus of Lille University of Science and Technology, in the south-east suburb of Lille.

Plot  It is 1988, and Melo, a Uruguayan town on the Brazilian border, awaits the visit of Pope John Paul II. Numbers begin circulating: hundreds of people will come, thousands say the media. To the poor citizens of Melo this means pilgrims in need of food and drink, paper flags, souvenirs, and commemorative medals. Brimming with enthusiasm, the locals hope not only for divine blessing but also a small share of material happiness. Petty smuggler Beto is certain that he's found the best business idea of all: \\"The Pope‚Äôs Toilet\\", where the thousands of visiting pilgrims can find relief. Beto is thwarted by lack of funds and the local mobile customs enforcement officer. Ultimately the promised \\"60,000 to 200,000\\" Brazilians do not materialise. Apparently (in the film's postscript) only 400 Brazilians came, disproportionately served by 387 stalls for food and trinkets. The film makes it clear that the visit was a financial disaster to the town rather than bringing any wealth as promised. Beto has spent his daughter's college fund to no avail, but she forgives him, and at least he has a nice toilet. Regardless of the claims made in the film's postscript committed to uphold a good sense of humor at all costs, international media reported the Pope's open-air mass in the town of Melo with 39,000 inhabitants was attended by a crowd of about 50,000 people.

She hit The Manacles on 14 October 1898 with the loss of 106 out of 197 on board. Design and construction The ship started life as the Cleopatra, a mixed passenger liner and animal carrier. She was built alongside four others at Earle's Shipbuilding and Engine Company, Hull, for the Wilson & Furness-Leyland Line. She was rated A1 at Lloyd's of London. She was built for 'safety at sea' and was equipped with eight watertight bulkheads, failsafe lighting and pumping systems, eight lifeboats capable of carrying 59 passengers each and three compasses. She could carry 120 first class passengers, with stalls for 700 cattle. She did not serve with the Wilson & Furness-Leyland Line, but instead was purchased by the Atlantic Transport Line, which was seeking to replace ships that had been requisitioned as troop transports by the United States government for use in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The other four ships acquired in this period were the Alexandria, Boadicea, Victoria and Winifreda, at a cost of around ¬£140,000 per ship. As the Cleopatra Captain Richard Griffith, commander of the Mohegan on her last voyage She sailed on her maiden voyage from London to New York on 31 July 1898, arriving on 12 August 1898. A number of defects were quickly revealed, her water system feeding the boilers malfunctioned and there were a number of serious leaks. The blame was placed on a rushed construction, and the crew struggled to keep the ship operational. The passengers protested to the company about the poor condition of the ship, but also reported \\"the splendid conduct of the officers and crew.\\" The Cleopatra returned to London, limited to half-speed the crossing took 21 days. Once she had docked an extensive programme of repairs was undertaken, which eventually lasted 41 days. She was then trialled, and inspected by the Board of Trade. She was pronounced fit to sail, and was duly renamed Mohegan. As the Mohegan Bound for New York, Mohegan sailed from Tilbury Docks at 2:30pm on 13 October 1898, under the command of the 42-year-old Captain Richard Griffith. She carried 57 passengers, 97 crew, seven cattlemen, and 1,286 tons of spirits, beer, and antimony. She arrived off Dover at 7:30 that evening, dropping her pilot. A report on the progress so far from the Assistant Engineer was probably landed at this time. A few minor leaks and electrical failures were reported but otherwise no major problems had been encountered. Mohegan then reached her maximum speed as she sailed down the English Channel. She kept close to the coast as she passed Cornwall, but took the wrong bearing. This was noticed by some of the officers and crew. They had noticed that the Eddystone Lighthouse was too far away and the coast too close. She neared the entrance of Falmouth Harbour and turned towards the entrance of the Helford River and on down The Lizard coast without slowing from 13 knots. This was noticed by the Coverack coastguard, which attempted to signal to her with warning rockets. The Mohegan either was unaware or took no notice, and maintained her course. James Hill, coxwain of the Porthoustock lifeboat saw the ship, lights ablaze, heading at full speed towards the Manacle Rocks. With a cry of 'She's coming right in!' he called his crew. =Wrecked on the Manacles= The Mohegan wrecked on the Manacles The crew were finally alerted now to the danger, whether by the signals from shore or by the 'old Manacle bell' from the buoy, and the engines were stopped at 6:50 PM, but too late. The Mohegan ran onto the Manacles, embedding the rudder into the rock and tearing the hull open. The ship had struck Vase Rock, and now drifted onto the Maen Varses reef. Dinner was being served at the time, and many of the passengers were initially unaware of the severity of the accident. The engine room was almost immediately flooded to three feet. The steam gauges broke and the crew rushed to the deck. The ship was plunged into darkness soon after. With the loss of power the passengers made their way onto the deck, where attempts were made to launch the lifeboats. Captain Griffith had ordered the fitting of a high second rail inboard of the lifeboats to prevent their being rushed in the event of an emergency, but this now hampered the launching of the boats. Further problems were encountered when the ship listed to port then heavily to starboard. Only two lifeboats were launched, of which one was virtually swamped and the other capsized. The ship rolled and sank 12 minutes after hitting the rocks, with the loss of 106 lives. Captain Griffith, Assistant Engineer William Kinley and all of the officers went down with the ship. Only her funnel and four masts remained above water. The Porthoustock lifeboat Charlotte was launched in 30 minutes and rescued most of the survivors from the wreck and the water; 44 persons were saved. The recovered bodies are buried in a mass grave Aftermath Most of the recovered bodies of the drowned were buried in a mass grave in St Keverne churchyard, which was given a memorial stained glass window by the Atlantic Transport Line. Some bodies were sent to London for burial, whilst eight were shipped to New York on the Mohegans sister ship Menominee. The Scottish poet William McGonagall immortalised the tragedy in his poem The Wreck of the Steamer \\"Mohegan\\" Most of the cargo was salvaged, though a diver lost his life in the process. The wreck gradually disintegrated in the following years. The third officer, William Logan Hindmarsh, age 30 is buried in the graveyard in Coverack, with an inscription indicating that the boat company paid for his gravestone and interment. The wreck of the Mohegan, and in the next year the stranding of the ocean liner SS Paris on Lowland point led to the introduction of the Coverack lifeboat. The remains of the wreck are popular with divers, and artefacts such as crockery and brass portholes are occasionally recovered. A magnificent staircase salvaged from the wreck stands in Coverack youth hostel, at Parc Behan, School Hill, Coverack. The ships Bell resides at the Bell Inn in Thetford, Norfolk. Controversy The sinking was the greatest disaster in the history of the Atlantic Transport Line to date, and occurred in mysterious circumstances, the ship had steered off course. The Board of Trade enquiry recorded > \\"that a wrong course ‚Äì W. by N. ‚Äì was steered after passing the Eddystone, > at 4.17 pm.\\" The loss of all of the officers in the wreck meant that no explanation could be found for the course, and it was ascribed to human error.

Dr. Michael Graetzel is the holder of 10 honorary doctorates in Universities of Asia and Europe: Denmark, Holland, China, Sweden, Singapore and other countries. He is the laureate of tens of prestigious scientific and engineering prizes, such as Grand Prix ‚ÄúMillennium Technology‚Äù, Medal of Faraday granted by British Royal Society, Gutenberg Prize, Albert Einstein Prize and others. Dr. Michael Graetzel is the member of Swiss Chemical Society, Society of Max Plank, and German Academy of Science (Leopoldina), as well as an honorable member of the Israeli Chemical Society and the Bulgarian Academy of Science, an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, and a Fellow of the US-National Academy of Inventors. Scientific achievements Michael Graetzel is one of developers of the so-called Graetzel cell operating on the principles of photosynthesis‚Äì the process similar to biochemical one and used by plants for light energy conversion into carbohydrates. The invention developed by the scientist since 1970th of past century represents profitable alternative for expensive and sophisticated technologies of photovoltaic arrays produced on the basis of silicon (in particular, the latter require expensive silicon of high purity). Compared to silicon-based batteries the Graetzel cells are rather simple and manufactured of low cost materials. First Graetzel cells discovered in 1991 were based upon porous layer of nanoparticles of titanium oxide covered with organic dye. Electrons from organic dye, able to efficiently adsorb solar radiation, migrate into conductive electrode made of titan dioxide and generate the electric flux. Commercial manufacturing of such cells was started just in 2009. At the initial stage, they possessed poor efficiency performances of 3-8% and poor stability due to available unstable liquid electrolyte and organic dye inside the cells. By 2012, the efficiency of cells has been increased by 11.9%. For the period over 20 years, the researchers headed by Graetzel have been working on the increase of efficiency of Graetzel solar cells and simplification of the technology of their production. In 2009, Japanese scientists managed to make a breakthrough and transfer from an organic pigment in the cells to hybrid organic-inorganic perovskite materials, and in 2012, they managed to replace liquid electrolyte by solid organic semiconductor. At that, a new class of devices, the so-called \\"perovskite solar cells\\" has emerged. At present, these devices are considered the most intensively studied materials in the world, and their efficiency currently exceeds 22%. Michael Graetzel's laboratories has set several world records with respect to the efficiency of perovskite solar batteries. Michael Graetzel is an ultimate leader in the field of materials for solar power industry and continues his works on development of photovoltaics all over the world; in particular, he actively cooperates with the researchers from Lomonosov Moscow State University in the area of perovskite photovoltaics.

In 2017, he was awarded the Global Energy Prize, \\"for transcendent merits in development of low cost and efficient solar cells, known as ‚ÄúGraetzel cells‚Äù, aimed to creation of cost-efficient, large-scale engineering solutions for power generation.\\" Interesting facts Graetzel cell-based batteries are more convenient for consumer compared to silicon-based photocells ‚Äì they could be made flexible and in various colors. It is convenient for use and power generation, for instance, in various structural elements of buildings. It is possible to create structurally transparent cells able to generate electric power within various bands of light frequencies, up to infrared one. It means that, in particular, they could be embedded into window glasses resulting in double effect for premises cooling and associated electric power generation. Several companies have already launched mass production of photocells based upon renewed Graetzel cells. Dr. Graetzel is the author of more than 1300 publications, two monographs; he holds more than 50 patents. He is one of the three globally most cited chemistry academicians.

He is best known for originating the role of Rodolfo in the original production of Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Regio Torino in 1896. Early life Evan Gorga was born in Brocco (now Broccostella), Italy in the province of Caserta (now Frosinone). His father, Pietro Gorga, was a small land owner, while his mother, Matilde De Santis, was the daughter of a local nobleman. The family lived in a house that stood in what is now the historical center of Broccostella. Education and career As a teenager and a young man, Gorga studied voice with a teacher with the surname Franceschetti. In 1894, he made his professional opera debut in the title role of Verdi's Ernani when called in to replace the scheduled performer, Francesco Tamagno, who was sick. In 1895, he performed the role of Wilhelm Meister in Ambroise Thomas's Mignon, Le Chevalier des Grieux in Jules Massenet's Manon, and Fritz Kobus in Pietro Mascagni's L'amico Fritz, all at the Teatro Comunale di Cagliari. He also performed in a production of Verdi's I Lombardi alla prima crociata at the Teatro Costanzi in Rome in September 1895. In 1896, Gorga became a part of music history when he originated the role of Rodolfo in the original production of Giacomo Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Regio Torino. That same year he also played the role of Faust in Boito's Mefistofele. In 1897, Gorga sang several roles at the Teatro La Fenice in Venice including the role of Marcello in Leoncavallo's La boh√®me which, like Puccini's version, is based on Henry Murger's Sc√®nes de la vie de Boh√®me. Over the next couple of years, Gorga reprised the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's La boh√®me with several companies, including the Teatro Piccinni in Bari, Teatro San Carlo in Naples and performances in Genoa. He gave performances of the title role in Gounod's Faust with several companies and was the tenor soloist is a production of Lorenzo Perosi's oratorio La risurrezione di Lazzaro at the Teatro dell'Aquila in Fermo. In January 1899, Gorga once again reprised the role of Rodolfo in Puccini's La boh√®me at the Teatro Drammatico in Verona. And although he received excellent critical reviews, this was his last performance. It is unclear why he gave up such a successful opera career at the young age of 34. Personal life Gorga was a collecter of antiques and artistic works. Among the large quantity of pieces he collected was a vast array of musical instruments. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties suffered during the Great Depression and World War II, Gorga had to sell about a half of this collection. In 1949 he left a collection of about 3.000 pieces, made up of mostly musical instruments but also a few paintings and other forms of art, to the State of Italy that is now on display at the Galleria Borghese in Rome. It is the largest collection of any kind ever given to the museum and makes up the bulk of the museum's entire musical instrument collection. Although technically a gift under a 1949 law, the Italian government agreed to pay Gorga's debts and to give him a life allowance in return for the collection.National Museum of Musical Instruments http://davidson.weizmann.ac.il/upload/(FILE)1167921594.pdf Sources * Operissimo.com *The New Grove Dictionary of Opera, edited by Stanley Sadie (1992), 5,448 pages, and *The Oxford Dictionary of Opera, by John Warrack and Ewan West (1992), 782 pages, *Opera: A Concise History, by Leslie Orrey and Rodney Milnes, World of Art, Thames & Hudson References Category:Italian operatic tenors Category:1865 births Category:1957 deaths Category:19th- century Italian opera singers Category:People from the Province of Frosinone Category:19th-century male singers ","title":"Evan Gorga"},{"id":"18090137","text":"Marie Lohr (28 July 1890 ‚Äì 21 January 1975) was an Australian born film and stage actress, active on stage and in film in Britain.

Later that month, Baraka and U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey Paul Fishman announced that the city had entered into an agreement with the US Justice Department to monitor the force. In the wake of the three-year report, Baraka in December announced a new citizen's advisory board composed of civilians and other measures. 2nd Precinct The post of chief of police was abolished in 2008, when the chief handled day-to-day operations and the director handled policy. The position was reestablished by the city council in July 2011. The department was headed by police director Samuel DeMaio between 2011 and 2014. Sheilah Coley was police chief between 2011 and 2014. In December 2015, a new position, Director of Public Safety, which would oversee both police and fire departments, was created. On August 5, 2016, Darnell Henry, a 22-year veteran of the Newark police department, was sworn in as chief of the force after serving in an acting capacity for several months. History The foundation for the Newark Police Department dates back to 1681 when two men were appointed as watchmen to preserve peace and crime in the town at night. Eventually, these responsibilities extended to more individuals and a group of seven watchmen were appointed to the four watch districts in Newark. Once Newark became incorporated in April 1836, Mayor William Halsey decided to extend a notion to institute the \\"City Watch.\\" The City Watch consisted of policemen who were responsible for patrolling the streets of Newark. In 1855, the watchmen were officially associated as the Constables and the Night Watch were those who kept watch at nighttime. In April 1857, the Newark Police Department was established when the municipal police replaced the Night Watch and Constables. Force The Newark Police Department is the largest municipal police force in New Jersey. In 2011 the size of the police department was reduced by 13% (167 officers) as the result of budget cuts. In November 2013, the NPD re-hired five officers who had been laid off, and another four who had previously worked in Camden. As of January 2014, the force had 800 officers in its ranks. It was announced that month that the city would hire 100 new officers, 50 immediately after they graduate from the police academy, which began in March 2014. In September 2014, 35 new officers were sworn in. The new hires are part of larger plan to expand the force to 1400 officers. In October 2014, Baraka said \\"We are looking at ways to make our police department more efficient, more responsive to our residents‚Äô needs\\" and proposed cost-cutting steps to get rid of stipends paid to detectives on top of their overtime payments, make weekends part of regularly scheduled workweeks (effectively creating Saturday to Thursday or a Tuesday to Sunday workweeks voiding weekend overtime). The plan would eliminate gasoline allowances for detectives and stop allowing department vehicles to be available for 24-hour personal use and stop automatic on-call time for police personnel, Baraka hoped to save $2 million annually and plans to use the money to hire 65 new officers in 2015. Baraka said the city also hoped to increase police salaries by two percent. In April 2014, it was announced that the state police would play a more prominent role in patrolling the streets of the city under the \\"TIDE-TAG\\" program.http://www.northjersey.com/news/newark-anti- violence-plan-calls-for-more-cops-1.997417 In July 2014 the mayors of Newark, Jersey City, and Paterson announced an initiative whereby the respective police forces would collaborate in certain areas including the sharing of intelligence about gangs, purchasing power agreements, and providing employment training and job entry programs.http://www.northjersey.com/news/paterson-joins-jersey-city-newark-to- launch-anti-crime-initiative-1.1058579 The department is a member of the New York-New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force.New York-New Jersey Regional Fugitive Task Force official web site accessed Departments Source: * Alcoholic Beverage Control Board (ABC Board) * Detective Division * Internal Affairs Bureau * Patrol Division * Records and Communications Bureau * Special Operations Bureau (which includes the Emergency Services Units) * Taxicab Commission * Youth and Community Service Bureau Precincts and divisions * 1st Precinct - 10 17th Ave. - Central Ward * 2nd Precinct/Training Academy - 1 Lincoln Ave. - North Ward * 3rd Precinct - 649 Market St. - Ironbound District(East Ward) * 4th Precinct/Internal Affairs Bureau - 247 16th Ave. - West Ward * 5th Precinct/Headquarters - 480 Clinton Ave. - South Ward * 6th Precinct - 491 Irvington Ave. - West Ward/Ivy Hill/Vailsburg * 7th Precinct - 159 North 10th St. - North Roseville Section/West of Branch Brooke Park * Administration Bureau. * Records and Communications Bureau - 311 Washington St. * Property and Procurement Section - 104 Arlington St. * Metro Division (Traffic/Downtown Enforcement) * General Crimes Division(Which Includes The Narcotics Squad) * Major Crimes Division * S.A.R.A (Sex Crimes) * C.D.T Command (Community Deployment Team). * Alcohol Beverage Control Unit * NPD Taxi Unit * Special Operations(Emergency Services Unit) Divisionhttps://npd.newarkpublicsafety.org Misconduct In May 2011, Officer Hugo Fierro beat a man with his pistol outside a local restaurant.

A ruckman, Jenkin first appeared for Collingwood in the 1963 season and after managing just three games that year missed all of 1965 with a broken leg. He returned in 1966 but couldn't break into their finals side and with first choice ruckman Ray Gabelich retiring that year he looked like getting more regular game time. The emergence of Len Thompson again relegated him to second ruckman but he played full seasons in 1970 and 1971. In 1974 he was traded to Essendon in a swap for John Williams but struggled in his time there with injury. In July 1976, he transferred to Brunswick in the Victorian Football Association.

Montgomery was born in India and was a cousin of Field Marshal Montgomery. He died as a result of wounds he sustained in the Bloody Sunday assassination of high-ranking British intelligence officers by the Irish Republican Army in the Irish War of Independence. Cricket career Montgomery played first-class cricket for Somerset County Cricket Club between 1901 and 1909. He also played a few matches for the Marylebone Cricket Club and one each for the Royal Navy cricket team and a \\"Gentlemen of England\\" team; he played in other non-first- class matches for both MCC and the Navy sides. Montgomery was a middle-order right-handed batsman and an occasional bowler whose bowling style is not known. He was educated at Marlborough College where he played in the annual match at Lord's against Rugby School in both 1897 and 1898. He made his first- class debut in two matches for Somerset in 1901. In the first, against the South Africans he made 1 and 0. He did marginally better a few weeks later with scores of 7 and 8 in the match against Gloucestershire County Cricket Club. He then made irregular appearances for Somerset until 1909, playing more than a couple of matches only in the 1904 season. In this year he made his only score of 50, reaching that exact score when opening the second innings as Somerset lost heavily to Sussex County Cricket Club. It was in 1904 as well that he took his only first-class wickets, five in all, with a best return of two for 17 against Hampshire County Cricket Club. As well as playing odd games for Somerset, he also appeared in most seasons in a couple of matches for MCC, though none of these matches were first-class until 1907. Similarly, he played for the Royal Navy cricket team against the British Army cricket team from 1908, but the only first-class match in this series he played in was his last first-class match in 1912. Military career Montgomery served with the Royal Navy but by 1916 during the First World War he was seconded to the General Staff as a brevet Major serving in the Royal Marine Light Infantry at the Admiralty. In 1917 he was promoted to be a temporary lieutenant-colonel and the citation in the London Gazette records that he has by this time been awarded the Distinguished Service Order medal. His Commonwealth War Graves Commission citation says that he was mentioned in despatches six times.Commonwealth War Graves Commission entry Death In 1920, Lt. Col. Montgomery was seconded to the British Army Intelligence Corps in Dublin during the Irish War of Independence. He was part of the Cairo Gang, a group of British spymasters whose deaths were ordered by Michael Collins as part of Bloody Sunday. On 21 November 1920, Collins' Twelve Apostles entered Montgomery's lodgings at 28 Pembroke Street and shot him. Lt. Col. Montgomery died of his wounds almost three weeks later. He was buried with full military honours at Brompton Cemetery.

The mountain straddles the border between Highland and Perth and Kinross council areas although the actual summit is in the latter.\\"OS Landranger 42\\" Shows county boundary on hill . Overview The high ground to the east side of the Pass of Drumochter takes the form of a huge undulating plateau, with an average height of over 800 metres, which stretches NE for 13 km to Loch an t-Seilich in the Gaick Forest. This area is often dismissed as uninteresting countryside, however it does contain two Munros which draws many walkers to the locale. A' Bhuidheanach Bheag lies to the southern end of the plateau and when viewed from the A9 road it shows many shallow ravines and gullies. The actual summit is out of sight from the A9 being sited back from the edge of the plateau. The rolling nature of the terrain makes A' Bhuidheanach Bheag a good hill for ski mountaineering.\\"The Munros (SMC Guide)\\", Donald Bennett (editor) et al., Page 89 Gives mountain description and routes.\\"The Munros, Scotland‚Äôs Highest Mountains\\", Cameron McNeish, Page 91 Gives general mountain description and states it is a good ski mountaineering hill. Despite its understated reputation A' Bhuidheanach Bheag does offer the walker the feeling of space and the wide open skies of the high Grampian mountains. Its gentle curving slopes have much wildlife with Eurasian dotterel, ptarmigan, grouse and mountain hare seen on a regular basis. The hill's name translates from the Gaelic language as ‚ÄúLittle Yellow Place‚Äù and is thought to refer to the coarse yellow grass which grows on its slopes. The ‚ÄúLittle‚Äù part of the name is slightly confusing as the hill is the highest point on the southern part of the plateau but demonstrates that the hill was named from how it looked from the valley not by its altitude.\\"The Magic of the Munros\\", Irvine Butterfield, Page 86 Gives meaning of Gaelic translation of name and meaning.\\"Hamish‚Äôs Mountain Walk\\", Hamish Brown, Page 155 Gives observations on name and wildlife and says Cama Choire is best feature. Geography and geology A' Bhuidheanach Bheag‚Äôs best geographical feature is the remote Cama Choire on the eastern side of the mountain. This is a steep sided valley which cuts deeply into the hill and is drained by the Allt a‚Äô Chama Choire. The coire is well seen from the hill of An Dun above the Gaick Pass. From a geological point of view the most interesting characteristic of the mountain is Coire Mhic-sith on its south-western flank. The coire is a deeply incised, fault- guided valley which has received the attention of geologists, especially the School of Geoscience at the University of Edinburgh who have concluded that the presence of glacial silt and sand in the valley along with a glacial spillway to the adjacent valley of the Edendon Water means that the coire had a large ice dammed lake during the last Ice age. This Proglacial lake drained away when the ice melted but has left evidence similar, but on a lesser scale, to the ‚Äúparallel roads‚Äù in Glen Roy.University of Edinburgh (School of Geosciences.) Gives information on Coire Mhic-sith geology. The summit of the mountain is a gentle rise on the plateau and is only made obvious by the presence of an OS trig point. There are occasional quartzite outcrops across the summit plateau and some of the boulders have been collected to surround the trig point, a few iron fence post have also been included. The OS map also shows a 936-metre spot height, half a kilometre to the west of the recognised summit. The summit is crossed by a line of old rusting boundary fence posts and these lead unerringly to the adjoining Munro of C√†rn na Caim which lies five km to the north across a boggy col with a height of 825 metres. A'Bhuidheanach Bheag has two subsidiary tops over 3,000 feet in height. Glas Mheall M√≤r (928 metres), just over two km to the ESE, is a Top in the current edition of Munro's Tables. Meall a' Chaorainn (916 metres) is located 1.5 km to the west of the summit and was deleted from the tables in 1981.Database of British and Irish Hills. Gives details of Munro Tops. All drainage from the mountain finds its way to the east coast of Scotland, the majority goes south to join the River Tay while a smaller percentage goes north via Glen Truim to join the River Spey. Ascents A' Bhuidheanach Bheag is usually climbed from the A9 road, there are two possible starting points, Balsporan Cottages () or 1.5 km to the north at the foot of Coire Chuirn. A more interesting route starts from the secluded country to the east at the ruined Sronphadruig Lodge and ascends by the Cama Choire to reach the plateau. Many walkers will continue to the adjacent Munro of C√†rn na Caim, the plateau is quite featureless and a map and compass is necessary in misty conditions.

It was named after the battle of Alcoraz which took place there in 1096. It is located next to San Jorge's hill and it has a capacity of 7,638 people. The architect Raimundo Bamb√≥ was in charge of stadium's design and construction. The cost of his work was covered thanks to the efforts of Jos√© Maria Mur, the club's president at that time. He was the one who suggested building a stadium and started the project, which lasted for 4 years. The stadium's cost amounted to approximately 15 million pesetas (about 90,000 euros). It was opened on January 16, 1972 with a match between SD Huesca and Deportivo Arag√≥n. In 1986, with the club drowning debts, the stadium went to auction. About 200 managers and fans of the club joined to form a society that won the auction, thus rescuing the stadium from the bank's embargo. Since then it has witnessed many social and sport events. These include a Copa del Rey match in 1990 between SD Huesca and C√°diz CF, which took place on December 13 and ended in a 0:0 tie followed by the C√°diz CF win by penalty shoot-out in the second game. As well as a match between Spain's Under-21 national football team and Greece, which took place on June 6, 2003, and ended in Spain winning 2:0. In the 2008/2009 season, after the promotion of SD Huesca to Segunda Divisi√≥n, there were important enhancements in the stadium: roof building, extension of the central stand, reconstruction of the presidential box, changing rooms, offices, and benches. With the promotion of Huesca to La Liga, the stadium was expanded from less than 5,500 seats to 7,638 seats in 2018 . The stadium underwent an extensive renovation. The changes have affected the stands, VIP guests boxes and spaces, the press room, mixed zone, toilets, bars, and the parking.

It attempts to diagnose an affliction or psychological disorder by interpreting shapes produced in water by heated alum or molten wax droppings from a burning candle. It is thus a form of both carromancy and oryctomancy.  Technique  Earlier and in some rural areas in the Philippines, alum (i.e., hydrated aluminum potassium sulfate or tawas in the vernacular) is ritualistically used by the albularyo or medicine man to pinpoint a variety of health conditions: a child's incessant crying, frequent fatigue, or even failure to conceive. The tawas is used to trace the sign of the cross on the patient‚Äôs forehead and other suspicious or ailing parts of the body as prayers are being whispered (bul√≥ng or oraci√≥n). The alum is then placed on glowing embers, removed when it starts to crack, then transferred to a small basin of water. As it cools, the alum‚Äôs new form spreads on the water‚Äôs surface and assumes a shape that may suggest the cause of the illness, often one of several indigenous forces: dwarfs, demons, or other malevolent spirits (na-nuno, na-kulam, na-demonyo). The water is then used to anoint the ailing part or parts of the body to counteract the evil forces or illness. The tawas is then discarded and thrown westward, preferably towards the setting sun. Presently and in most areas, an albularyo simply lights and holds the candle during the ritual. In some, it is the albularyo's assistant or the afflicted person who holds the candle, but almost invariably, it is the albularyo who interprets the vague shapes produced by the wax as it re-solidifies in the basin of water. An albularyo may see supernatural beings displeased as cause of the illness in the shapes and forms, and suggest some cleansing ritual or peace offering to a spirit. Modern variations have the albularyo use other materials for divination, such as eggs, mirrors, blank paper, cigarettes,FMAdigest chewing gum, chicken feathers, and the liver of a freshly-slaughtered chicken or pig (the last one classically known in the West as haruspicy).

History  CBN was launched in the United Kingdom during January 2004 by the then Rural Affairs Minister Alun Michael and Broadband Minister Stephen Timms; at this time the UK was lagging behind neighboring developed countries in the provision of first generation broadband services, leaving significant holes in availability. Many of these \\"notspots\\" were in rural areas or were the focus of economic regeneration programmes; local community organizations were beginning to develop their own services typically using Wi-Fi wireless technology but often without specialist telecommunications knowledge within their groups. CBN was founded as a co-operative of such groups, able to provide support and specialist skills to its members; during 2004-5 CBN supported over 100 local broadband projects with direct consultancy and mentoring, and provided online information and support for a further 200.  Today  With first generation broadband widely available in the UK, CBN's focus shifted towards the community led higher-speed next-generation broadband services, including fibre-optic networks. In 2006 CBN signed a joint venture agreement with Dutch consultancy Close the Gap, which was responsible for conceiving, planning and delivering the OnsNet (‚Äúour net‚Äù in English) Fibre to the Home (Ftth) project in the market town of Nuenen and then in Eindhoven. Retaining the social enterprise model, CBN now works with community groups, policy makers, and industry to develop thinking on next generation broadband platforms and strategies in the UK. CBN is represented on several key broadband forums: :* An executive member of the UK Broadband stakeholder group, the body that brings together government, industry, Regional Development Agencies, and business to drive forward the UK's broadband agenda. :* A member of the NOMAD Wireless Forum bringing together a range of public sector and private organisations active in promoting wireless initiatives. :* A member of the Connected Neighbourhood Forum linking the 10 local authority Digital Challenge finalists. :* An invited participator in the high level summit organised by minister Stephen Timms in November 2007 to discuss policy on Next Generation Access in the UK. CBN‚Äôs experience has attracted international attention Start of Web4Dev (Nov 2007). and they are developing community broadband projects in Africa supported by UN-HABITAT. In 2008 Francesco Caio, in his report Caio Review at barriers to broadband investment for the British Government, referred to CBN's scenario work which described a \\"patchwork quilt\\" of broadband infrastructures rather than a single \\"da wo\\" (big me) incumbent network owner. This led to Lord Carter recommending that CBN be assisted in creating a national framework in his Digital Britainhttp://www.culture.gov.uk/what_we_do/broadcasting/5631.aspx Digital Britain report report. In 2009, CBN has been facilitating the creation of the Independent Networks Co-operative Association (INCA)http://www.inca.coop/ INCA website to meet the Digital Britain recommendations. INCA is essentially a trade association for independent network operators in the UK who are investing alternative next generation broadband infrastructures.

Built in 1906, this duplex was the focus of the 1948 United States Supreme Court case Shelley v. Kraemer, which ruled that judicial enforcement by state courts of racially restrictive covenants violated the Constitution. The house was designated a National Historic Landmark on December 14, 1990. Description The house is a two-story brick rowhouse, typical of many found in St. Louis, in the Fairground district of St. Louis. The house retains integrity of design and construction from the date of its construction and the date of its historic significance. The house is arranged with apartments upstairs and downstairs, entered by separate doors from the front porch. The framed front porch rests on brick pillars, with wood columns supporting the shed roof. Both levels follow a four-room plan, flanked by a side hall. The front rooms feature a fireplace. An addition to the rear houses a bedroom on both levels. History The J. D. Shelley family had moved from Starkville, Mississippi in 1930, fleeing from racially motivated violence. After renting for a time, the Shelleys sought to buy the house at 4600 Labadie in 1945. The house was under a 1911 covenant that prohibited the sale of the house to anyone of the \\"Negro or Mongolian race\\" for a fifty-year period, of which the Shelleys were unaware. The Shelleys were sued by the Louis D. Kraemer family, owners of other property on the street, to restrain the Shelleys from taking title to the property. While the trial court held for the Shelleys, the decision was reversed by the Missouri Supreme Court in 1946. The Shelleys appealed to the United States Supreme Court in 1947. The U.S. Office of the Solicitor General filed, for the first time in a civil rights case, an amicus curiae (\\"friend of the court\\") brief in support of the Shelleys. The May 3, 1948 decision rendered all racially restrictive covenants unenforceable on the grounds that enforcing them would violate the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

Many of the exposition buildings were temporary in nature, but a number of permanent structures were built and are used by Washington University, which calls this area the Danforth Campus. The district includes more than fifty structures, of which twenty are in the Collegiate Gothic style. The overall plan for the Washington University campus was conceived by Olmsted, Olmsted and Eliot in 1895, and a national competition was held in 1899 for the new buildings. Cope and Stevenson of Philadelphia was the winning firm, drawing on experience gained at Bryn Mawr College, the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton University. As construction proceeded, plans for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition incorporated the new buildings, leasing the campus and providing funding for more buildings. The Collegiate Gothic structures form a unified composition, despite their construction over a fifty-year period. This is attributed to a style guide compiled by architect James P. Jamieson, who defined the use of red granite, green slate shingles and copper flashing and drainage details. Windows are set in limestone surrounds. Buildings are typically sited around a quadrangle that forms a high point, so that the building elevations facing the quad are two stories, while the rear elevations are three stories. Plans are standardized with many buildings using an elongated H-shaped plan with a central tower of three to five stories. University buildings included: *Brookings Hall (1900), the defining landmark on Washington University campus, used as the Exposition's administration building. *Busch Hall (1900), used for the fair's Division of Works, including architects, engineers and construction management. *Ridgley Library (1901), used by the British Government for the display of items from Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. *Eads Hall (1902), used by the Board of Lady Managers. *Cupples Hall I (1901), used for anthropology, including mummies in the basement. *Cupples Hall II(1901), used for the Jefferson Guard, the fair's security apparatus. *Prince Hall (1901) *Karl D. Umrath Hall (1902), used as a guest dormitory *Francis Gymnasium (1902) and Francis Field (1902-1903), used for displays of physical culture and the Third Olympic Games. Later compatible additions include McMillan Hall (1906), Graham Chapel (1907), Newton R. Wilson Memorial Hall (1923), Duncker Hall (1923), Grace Vall√© January Hall (1923), Charles Rebstock Hall (1926), the Ann W. Olin Women's Building (1927), Wayman Crow Hall (1933), George Warren Brown Memorial Hall (1935), the Sever Institute of Technology (1948) and Louderman Hall (1951). Other buildings constructed for the Exposition include: *The Palace of Fine Art, designed by architect Cass Gilbert, featured a grand interior sculpture court based on the Roman Baths of Caracalla. Standing at the top of Art Hill, it now serves as the home of the St. Louis Art Museum. *The Missouri State building was planned as a permanent structure, but it burned down on November 18, and since the fair was almost over it was not rebuilt. After the fair, the World's Fair Pavilion was built on the site of the Missouri building. *Completed in 1913, the Jefferson Memorial building was built near the main entrance to the Exposition, at Lindell and DeBalivere. It was built with proceeds from the fair, to commemorate Thomas Jefferson, who initiated the Louisiana Purchase, and to store the Exposition's records and archives. It is now home to the Missouri History Museum.

Protest camps may also have a symbolic or reproductive component where 'protest campers' try and recreate their desired worlds through the enactment of protest camp infrastructures (such as communal kitchens, child care, environmentally friendly composting toilet or use of grey water systems) or through the modes of organising and governance (e.g. direct democracy). Camping on and/or occupying land has a long history which can be traced back to nomadic cultures as well as the 17th century Diggers. However, the use of protest camps as a contemporary form of protest can be linked back to the US civil rights movement of the 1960s and, specifically, \\"Resurrection City\\", a protest camp held in May 1968 in Washington, D.C. as part of the Poor People's Campaign.

Guillemin started his studies at Beaune college before taking his final degree in Paris. From 1850 to 1860 he taught mathematics in a private school while writing articles for the Liberal press criticizing the Second French Empire. In 1860, he moved to Chamb√©ry where he became a junior deputy editor of the weekly political magazine La Savoie. After the annexation of Savoy by the French empire, he returned to Paris where he became the science editor of l‚ÄôAvenir national (The Nation's Future). Guillemin presently started writing books of physics and astronomy which became very popular. He wrote \\"The Sky\\" which was translated into many languages. His major work, \\"The Physical World\\", consisted of five large volumes. His publisher, Hachette, encouraged him to write a series of booklets about astronomy and physics under the title \\"Small popular encyclopaedia\\", a scientifically sound but accessible collection about sciences and their applications. French astronomer Jacques Crovisier from the Observatoire de Paris suggests he may have been a source of inspiration for Jules Verne's 1865 novel, From the Earth to the Moon.Jules Verne, les machines et la science; Jacques Crovoisier Bibliography *La Lune (the moon) *Le Soleil (the sun) *La Lumi√®re et les Couleurs (light and colours) *Le Son (sound) *Les Etoiles, notions d‚Äôastronomie sid√©rale (the stars, notions of sidereal astronomy) *Les N√©buleuses (nebulae) *Le Feu souterrain.

He collaborated to a number of literary, scientific and political papers and magazines, notably La Nature, la R√©publique Fran√ßaise and la Revue Philosophique et Religieuse. Additionally he wrote Electricity and Magnetism in which he presented a theory of magnetism. It was Guillemin who drafted the entry on astronomy in the second edition of Dorbigny's Dictionary of natural history. Guillemin was also involved in politics and remained faithful to his liberal convictions to the end.

One of the gallery‚Äôs original objectives was to offer solo exhibitions to London-based artists at the start of their careers - several of whom have gone on to achieve international success. The gallery was soon solely run by Jake Miller as the other original founder members wished to concentrate on their own careers. Since 1998 the gallery began representing artists and the programme expanded into an international one, working with established artists as well as continuing to exhibit younger emerging artists and curating a lively group show programme. In April 2006, The Approach opened a second gallery space (The Reliance) above a pub of the same name in Old Street, Shoreditch.Artnotes: Reliant (expansion plans of The Approach Gallery), Art Monthly, April 1, 2006.

Opening November 1, 1999, the museum recreated, in spirit, the dime museums which saw their heyday in the 19th and early 20th centuries in America. The museum closed officially in late 2006. Description The museum started out as two rooms of its 1808 Maryland Avenue address, which had previously been Horne's antique shop and art studio, Time Bandit, which became Horne's moniker and nickname. Early on, the museum expanded to include the entire first floor of 1808 (the galleries in homage to dime museum attractions), a lower gallery (which housed the sideshow attractions), and the first floor of 1806 Maryland Ave. (devoted to old-time stage performance and natural history attractions). At one point, for a brief period, the museum also included a wax gallery located in the front room of 1804. Its wax show was the Lord's Last Supper, a staple of wax museums and traveling shows for decades, the display based in the famous Da Vinci artwork. During its years of operation, the ADM or ‚Äúthe Dime,‚Äù as it was known to many, showcased an array of permanent attractions, many authentic and many ‚Äúauthentic fakes‚Äù or gaffs as they would be termed by show people. Such manufactured attractions were the forte of Horne, whose artworks in that vein included the Samoan Sea Wurm (a ‚Äúmummified‚Äù sea serpent carcass showcased with a bite of fur from the shipboard cat it had supposedly eaten) and Lincoln's Last Turd (a gaff of a gaff, actually, since it was displayed as a fake made not by Horne but by another who had tried to cash in on the craze for Lincoln memorabilia by faking the assassinated president's last bowel movement). Between Horne's gaff artworks, the tongue-in-cheek signs throughout the museum, the wild assortment of off-beat attractions, and the uproarious periodic live shows given off-site (since the museum had no space for performance), the museum garnered a vast amount of publicity including write ups in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Japan Times, The Baltimore Sun and travel magazines, including National Geographic Traveler. It was also featured frequently on both television and radio, from two segments on National Public Radio to an episode of National Geographic Channel's Mummy Roadshow, the episode focusing on the museum's giant mummy. The museum was also the site of filming for numerous television documentaries on the subject of sideshows and ‚Äúweirdness as entertainment,‚Äù usually featuring Taylor in his capacity as variety entertainment historian. The museum's front window also showcased a reproduction of Haussner's Restaurant's legendary ball of string. Closing Horne and Taylor parted ways in November 2003, and Horne continued to operate the museum until its closure and his auctioning of his half of the collection in February 2007. Taylor, after leaving the partnership and removing his half of the museum attractions, almost immediately began work on another museum in Washington, D.C., the Palace of Wonders, a museum which also featured regular stage performances, performances being an old-time dime museum feature for which the American Dime Museum simply never had the space. The Palace of Wonders opened in June 2006. Reopening and the next generation After visiting the American Dime Museum in Baltimore, Maryland in 2002, the erotic artist Peter Excho (Pexcho) was captivated by the \\"Time Bandit\\" and proprietor, Dick Horne. Very soon after, Pexcho became a volunteer at the American Dime Museum and began his tutelage in the lost art of preserving the Sideshow or freakshow that P.T. Barnum began in the late 19th century. After the auction of Dick Horne's Collection in 2007, Pexcho returned to Baton Rouge, Louisiana, where he reopened his coffee and art house, Insomkneeacks, next to the Old Broadmoor Theater on Florida Boulevard in a rundown shopping center built in Baton Rouge during the 1960s. During and after his apprenticeship with Dick Horne, Pexcho began collecting wonders and oddities of his own through the use of the Internet. Pexcho had several exhibits bequeathed to him from Horne's collection at the Baltimore American Dime Museum and won a few at the museum's auction of 2007. With Horne's approval, Pexcho started constructing and building within Insomkneeacks III in Baton Rouge, a new and revitalized American Dime Museum, with living and preserved specimens of both the natural and unnatural world. Featuring a menagerie of infant animals from North America, Pexcho's American Dime Museum in 2011 now contains wonders and curiosities that cannot be found anywhere else. What began with \\"Curiosity Cabinets\\" in wealthy homes in the late 19th century has now evolved into a living document and testament to a nearly forgotten past and a hopeful future, where \\"normal\\" is the oddity. Peter Excho has revived and rebooted the American Dime Museum for the next generation of doubters, gawkers and non-Believers, preserving and displaying truly wonderful, exotic, rare and fantastic anomalies that occur and exist to this day. Peter Excho is the new caretaker of a legacy that began with Barnum, and through Dick Horne's dedication, passion and vision, Pexcho gives visitors and patrons a glimpse and respite into the past, providing the ability for the public to experience an authentic Victorian era American Dime Museum in the 21st Century. As of June 8th, 2019, Pexcho moved his American Dime Museum to Augusta, Georgia and re-opened it there.

It forms small, soft, olive-brown tufts on the surface of other plants. Filaments rarely exceed centimetres in length. It may grow by intercalary growth. Its sporangia may contain one or many cavities, and emerge directly from the surface cells; they may form a ring around the main nema. Dedicated photosynthetic machinery may be entirely absent. Its life history consists of alternation of phases; it has isogamous gametes, and dioecious gametophytes. At warm temperatures , the alga reproduces sexually, forming single chambered \\"meiosporangia\\". At cooler temperatures, asexual reproduction took place in multi-chambered \\"mitosporangia\\". The gametophyte phase only produces gametes when day length is long; with shorter days these too reproduce asexually. This is probably because the plants upon which they are epiphytic only grow in the spring. The gametophyte is filamentous ‚Äì while the sporophyte bears parenchyma, even though it only reaches around in length. The alga has a small genome with approximately 12 chromosomes.

Development has been ongoing since March 2006. Operation of Dragon Saga is relegated to different publishers for their respective regions. Whilst being free-to-play, the game also includes a cash shop that allows for unique customization of player's characters. The game's commercial launch was on June 2009 in China and October 2009 in Europe and October 2010 in North America. Characters created during the Open Beta testing were carried over to the commercial release. Six content expansions for the game have been released, all of which are free: Tales of the Damned which was released on 16 October 2009 and Awakening of the Ice Dragon which was released on 15 February 2011 have both been released in North America. Plot Dragon Saga takes place on the continents of El Grego and Angrakka (Elyades and Melanthos in Europe), which had experienced a golden age where humans and dragons were able to live together in peace. These times were not destined to last, and the dragons and humans eventually went to war in what was known as the Dragon Age. Eventually, the dragons were banished to the ancient realm of Aether. The leader of the dragons, Dark Dragon Elga, would continue to mount attacks, but was pushed back when five heroes of legend defeated and trapped him in a prison known as the Shadow Cabinet. Not even the Shadow Cabinet could hold Elga forever -- a thousand years after being trapped, Elga found a method to release his darkness into the world, sending minions to attack the lands in preparation for his arrival. It is up the players to take up arms and push back these dark forces. Gameplay Players control a character in a three- dimensional plane but the scope of movement is mainly focused on the horizontal axis with limited vertical movement, much like the arcade style side-scrolling classics. In its current state, players can progress through 75 levels in the North American release with the level cap reaching as high as 80 on servers in Asia. Combat is action-based with moves performed in real-time. All combat is centered around the use of special skill sets on cooldowns. Players can also perform ground and aerial combos by utilizing certain skills in order to render enemies unable to retaliate but can also play the role of a healer or supporter when necessary. There is also a large number of missions and scenarios for a player to complete co-operatively with others. Each individual dungeon has one to four separate modes for advancement, each increasing in difficulty and not being accessible until the previous instance has been cleared. At the end of every mission sequence is a scenario that advances your character to the next stage of the game. =Classes= At the beginning of the game, players are allowed to choose from one of six basic classes and accumulate levels in order to advance into deeper specialties with more abilities and skills. The six starting classes are warrior, thief, archer, magician, summoner, and twin fighter. Each class has a diverse skill tree in which players may place points into to acquire new skills or enhance ones that have already been obtained. As of 15 February 2011, there are currently a total of four class advancements in the game bringing the total number of playable classes to 28. =Tasks= Dragon Saga features instances that allow players to gain access to items, experience, and currency as well as serve to advance the overall storyline in the game. These instances are known as \\"missions\\" and must be completed sequentially in order to unlock the final scenario that advances the plot. Each step in the mission becomes significantly more difficult than the previous and oftentimes requires a group to complete. Missions are often composed of four main mission modes (increasing in difficulty) and a fifth scenario (unlocked when the previous modes have been completed). Each step in the mission also features a grading system that attempts to rank players based on how a player has performed during that step. The grading system allows the player to obtain higher quality and quantity loot based on that individual's performance and group contribution. Players will often be sent into these missions to complete important quests, such as those needed to change class. Although many of these missions can be done by oneself, the benefits of tackling these missions with others far outweigh that of taking them on alone. Players in groups gain bonus experience and, with the right group composition, will find it much easier to progress through the game. Expansions = Tales of the Damned (1) = Tales of the Damned was published on 16 October 2009 in Europe and November 2010 in North America. Tales of the Damned added a variety of new content and features to the game. This included the addition of a new storyline, controller support and the introduction of pets. The expansion elaborated into the story of the first chapter and as a result two new areas in Dragotaka were also introduced accessible to those who are level 60 or above only; the Van Cliff Dungeon and Drakos' Tower, which served as a fortified tower used to imprison the evil Dragon Lord Elga, until the witch Paris broke in and freed him to cause mayhem across the land. In addition to these new maps, Tales of the Damned also raised the level cap from 60 to 65. = Paris Strikes Back (2) = Paris Strikes Back was the second expansion to Dragon Saga and was released only in Europe on 23 June 2010. This expansion included the next chapter of the storyline, increased the level cap from 60 to 70 and has other general enhancements such as new weapon and armour sets. Some maps were also given a nice tune-up including the Van Cliff Dungeon and Drakos' Tower, both of which were given the choice of three levels of difficulty. Also, eight new classes were added to the game: Dragoon, Berserker, Sentinel, Bombardier, Joker, Shadow Walker, Cleric and Chaosmage. All the new classes were named by the Dragon Saga forum community but are only accessible after the player hits level 60 and a chain quest is completed. = Dragon Saga Kryos Unleashed (Dragon Saga Awakening of the Ice Dragon) (3) = Awakening of the Ice Dragon (known as Kryos Unleashed in North America) was the third expansion to Dragon Saga. It was released on 15 February 2011 in Europe and North America. The expansion includes the brand new ice continent of Pagosia in which the third chapter of the story is set. As the name suggests, large portions of Pagosia are entombed in ice, with its frosty appearance enhanced by the spooky spectral creatures that live in its fresh landscape. Seasoned heroes, from level 62 upwards, will find a large quantity of new maps in Pagosia, filled with new sets of both hero and daily quests, providing more than enough challenges for players. The expansion also increased the level cap again, this time to level 75. All the classes introduced in Paris Strikes Back were also made available in the North American version of this expansion. = Dragon Saga Elga Unleashed (Dragon Saga New Origin) (4-1) = Elga Unleashed (also known as New Origin) is the fourth expansion for Dragon Saga., Retrieved 2011-06-08. It was released on 8 June 2011 in the Japanese server, 10 August 2011 on the SEA server and 12 September 2011 on the European Servers. The expansion includes a new playable race that has 2 new classes. These 2 classes are the summoner and the twin fighter. The fourth chapter to the story is added and as a result the world map has had a complete overhaul due to the influence of chaos in the world of Dragotaka. The level cap has been raised to 80. The second phase of the Elga Unleashed expansion known as Elemental Guardians introduces new content including two new dungeons. = Dragon Saga Worlds Collide (4-2) = Worlds Collide was a major event for Dragon Saga. It involved an in game crossover event between Dragon Saga and Ragnarok Online which was exclusive to the WarpPortal North America release. This mini- expansion opens a new series of quests and dungeons with a unique top down camera angle. Costumes, pets, mounts and weapons from Ragnarok Online are available through the quests and merchants near the dungeon entrances. = Dragon Saga Galaxia (5) = Galaxia is the fifth official expansion for Dragon Saga. It was released in 2013 on the North American worldwide servers. The expansion follows the player as they help Crete save her lover, the god Pios, from the chaos of the corrupted Zodiac! This includes new class abilities, quest lines, 10 new zodiac themed dungeons with 4 difficulty levels, an increased level cap (lvl 85) for players. = Dragon Saga Arcadia, Episode 1 (6-1) = Arcadia, Episode 1 is the sixthofficial expansion for Dragon Saga. It was released in 2016 on the North American worldwide servers. This expansion explores new lands and cities of Arcadia; a land of elemental power. Players can discover hidden dungeons and defeat powerful elementals, dragons, and monsters while crafting powerful elemental weapons and armors. This expansion includes new class abilities, quest lines, pets and mounts, costumes and weapons, new socketing systems, and new elemental stat progressions. = Dragon Saga Arcadia, Episode 2 (6-2) = Arcadia, Episode 2 is the second part of the seventh expansion for Dragon Saga. It was released in 2017 on the North American worldwide servers. This expansion builds on the previous update, with new maps, class balances, events, monsters, dungeons and equipment. Content updates continue on a weekly basis. = Dragon Saga Arcadia, Episode 3 (6-3) = Arcadia, Episode 3 is the final part of the seventh expansion for Dragon Saga. It was released in 2018 on the North American worldwide servers. This expansion completes the main story line started in the vanilla game, with new maps, class balances, events, monsters, dungeons and equipment. Content updates continue on a weekly basis. The final boss, Destiny Dragon proved to be much too challenging in initial releases and has been reworked in subsequent updates. Along with the expansion came a graphical overhaul of the PVP maps and the Arcadia City region. With Arcadia 3 came a change in the overall tone of the logo, login screen and patcher, reflecting the dark and corrupted nature of the Destiny Dragon. = Dragon Saga Evolved (7-1) = A large technical update including changes to monster stats, item stats, player skills and class re-balancing. The update was met with mixed results, positive from w2p users and negative from f2p, abusers and bot users. Part of the update was adding changes to the in game interface and attack skills to curb the use of automated bot farmers. Much of the update restored and built upon abandoned skills and weapon stats from earlier expansions. http://www.playdragonsaga.com/ Development ICE Entertainment released Version 6 of the Chinese Dragonica in Open Beta on April 24, 2009. IAH's and 8interactive's Dragonica for the SEA-ANZ region have been live since 2009. gPotato Europe's EU English, French and German services began on June 10, 2009 after a Closed Beta period in the previous month.

Biography Ernest William Watson was born into a musical family in Hull, Yorkshire, his mother having been a piano teacher, his father a music dealer, and his brother an actor.Stanley Yates, preface to his edition of 23 Guitar Solos ... (2000); see 'Modern editions', p. 3. He began his musical education on the violin. He came to the guitar when he discovered a composition for guitar by the Spanish composer Dionisio Aguado. Viewing it as a challenge, he bought a guitar and practised until he could play it.Liner notes to CD Ernest Shand. Guitar Music and Songs (1996), see 'Recordings'. He then became a pupil of Madame Sidney Pratten (1821‚Äì1895) who provided him with scores and became the first publisher of his compositions. These apparently impressed her so much that by 1888 she apparently had nothing more to teach him, and that his pieces were superior to hers.S.W. Button (1989), p. 157; see Bibliography. Before the age of 30, Shand had already written more than 150 pieces for solo guitar, a guitar concerto (the first from the British Isles) and a tutor (1896). In the United Kingdom, his playing remained unsurpassed until the emergence of Julian Bream in the late 1940s. Despite his success as a composer and performer, the guitar was a relatively small niche in England. Shand made his living mainly from acting in music halls, and only late in life was persuaded by his wife and friends to take up the guitar professionally. Even then he had to return to acting after he had lost money in a studio and advertising business. As an actor, he travelled as far as Australia, where he also gave guitar recitals. Shand moved to London in 1896, where he was elected to the Senate of the London Guild of Violinists and gave a well-received series of performances at the Royal College of Music. During one of his tours, he was apparently attacked by an aggrieved Russian and sustained severe injuries that affected him for the rest of his life. Shand published his last music around 1910, after which he moved to Mosley, Birmingham. At the outbreak of World War I, he entertained British troops on the guitar. He died in Birmingham. Music As a composer, Shand was able to sustain the growth of the classical guitar against the popularity of large orchestras by writing music that brought guitar composition to a more modern approach. Shand produced a wide range of music including salon pieces, dances, variations, fantasias, songs, chamber music, piano pieces, transcriptions and pedagogical works. \\"All of these compositions are filled with unbridled individualism; lyrical pieces that are peppered with the suggestion of song.\\"Quoted from √âditions Orph√©e webpage with Shand's guitar concerto, Shand concerto.

The company had been founded in 1903 as Unione Austriaca di Navigazione, more commonly called the Austro-American or Austro-Americana Line, when Trieste was under the rule of Austria-Hungary.  History  Austro-Americana Line, Fratelli Cosulich, 1909 In 1857 Captain Antonio F. Cosulich launched the family business with the 500-tonne ship Fideshttps://www.cosulich.com/history Cosulich built in Cherso, Greece.https://maritime-union.com/company/fratelli-cosulich-spa Maritime Union Unione Austriaca di Navigazione was founded in Trieste in 1903 by Fratelli Cosulich. The Cosulich family originated from the island of Lussino (today Lo≈°inj, Croatia). Operating as the Austro-American Line, ships of the company carried passengers from Trieste to Messina, Naples, Palermo, and New York. Service to South American ports and New Orleans began in 1907 (though the New Orleans service was quickly discontinued). Cosulich made arrangements with the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company for service from Trieste to Canada which proved to be uneconomical and was cancelled after six voyages. At the outbreak of World War I, passenger services ceased. After the Armistice, Trieste came under the rule of Italy. Reorganized as an Italian company under the name Cosulich Societa Triestina di Navigazione, or Cosulich STN, the line, now sailing under the Cosulich Line name, resumed service from Mediterranean ports to New York and South America. In 1932, the Cosulich Line and fellow Italian passenger companies Lloyd Sabaudo and Navigazione Generale Italiana were merged into the state-owned Italia Flotte Riunite (), or ITALIA, though Cosulich was able to maintain its own management from Trieste. When ITALIA was liquidated in 1937, Cosulich was absorbed into the replacement Italia Societa Anonima di Navigazione, or Italian Line. The company exists today as the Fratelli Cosulich Group, still a shipowner and based in Trieste.

History  It was set up in 1992 on a piece of land donated by Central Luzon State University on its main campus, initially with network centers. 7 more network centers were added in 1994 bringing the total to 13. It was sponsored as a bill by the then senator Joseph Estrada and eventually enacted as a law through Republic Act 7307 or the Philippine Carabao Act of 1992. Imported Breeds Indian-origin Murrah buffalo dairy breed of Asian water buffalo, at PCC imported from Bulgaria. To improve the breeds and milk yield, high milk yield Murrah buffalo breed were imported from the Central Institute for Research on Buffaloes, Hisar, India, a reputed species of the dairy type originating from Haryana state of India. Murrah breed are reputed as a high milk yield breed that can produce an average of more than eight liters of milk daily over a 300 days long annual productive cycle. Better performing Murrah buffalo can produce 12 to 15 liters per day on average, with top performers going up to 25 liters per day. PCC also imported Murrah breed from non-native-breed third-party countries such Bulgaria, USA and Latin America. PCC breeds and cross-breeds Murrah buffalo through artificial insemination. Reproduction Technology The PCC had some success in reproductive biotechnology in 2004 when the first test-tube buffalo was born on April 5, also the birthday of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo. Incidentally, the test-tube buffalo is a female and was named as \\"Glory\\" after the President. Milk Yield Improvement Late in 2007, according to Filipino scientists, the Center located in Nueva Ecija initiated a study to breed the super water buffalo that could produce 4 to 18 liters of milk/day using gene- based technology. The majority of the funding came from the Department of Science and Technology. When this marker-assisted selection process is perfected it will allow the poor farmers to conserve their resources by raising only the best producers that are genetically selected soon after birth.

It is located 23 km west of Palakkad on the Palakkad - Pattambi Road. The nearest town is Ottapalam, which is 10 km away. Lakkidi is situated 303 km from the state capital, Thiruvananthapuram. The pin code of Lakkidi Post Office is 679301 and the STD code is 0466. History This place was originally part of the Valluvanad Swaroopam dynasty. Valluvanad was an erstwhile late medieval feudal state in present state of Kerala in South India extending from the Bharathapuzha River in the south to the Pandalur Mala in the north during their zenith in the early Middle Ages. On the west, it was bounded by the Arabian Sea at the port Ponnani and on the east by Attappadi Hills. Legends According to local legends, the last Later Chera ruler gave a vast extension of land in South Malabar to one of their governors, Valluvakkonithiri and left for a hajj. The Valluvakkonithiri was also given last Later Chera ruler's shield (presumably to defend himself from the sword received by the Samoothiri (Zamorin) of Kozhikode, another governor, from the departing ruler). Not surprisingly, the Vellatiri rajas were hereditary enemies of the Samoothiri. Valluvanad is famous for the Mamankam festivals, held once in 12 years and the endless wars against the Samoothiri of Kozhikode. By the late 18th century, Vellatiri or Walluwanad proper was the sole remaining territory of the Walluvanad raja (Valluva Konatiri), who once exercised suzerain rights over a large portion of Southern Malabar. Although management of the country was restored to the Vellatiri raja in 1792, it soon became evident that he was powerless to repress the trouble that quickly broke out between Mapillas (favored by the Mysorean occupiers) and nayars (who sought to restore the ancien r√©gime), and already in 1793 management of the district had to be resumed as the chief and his family fled to Travancore.

The area that presently comprise Toronto is a part of the Carolinian forest, although agricultural and urban developments destroyed significant portions of that life zone. In addition, many of Toronto's native trees have been displaced by non-native plants and trees introduced by settlers from Europe and Asia from the 18th century to the present. Most of the native trees are found in the Toronto ravine system, parks, and along the Toronto waterway system. The type of trees growing across the city varies based on the soil condition in the area. Tree cover in the city prior to European settlement started from the shore line back. Settlement resulted in trees being cut for use in building homes and ships and for heating by early residents. The current tree cover (or canopy) in Toronto is estimated to be between 26.6 and 28%Strategic Forest Management Plan and many trees are not native to the city.

He plays as a prop. He started off his career with the Lions in the Super 14 competition, then he joined the Stormers for the start of the 2008 season before joining the Saints. He went to Peterhouse Boys' School in Marondera in Zimbabwe, along with the Sharks and capped Springbok Tendai Mtawarira. Despite having already played for the Springboks Mujati's test career was cut short when he was declared ineligible to play because he was not legally a South African citizen. He opted to join Northampton Saints to further pursue his rugby career. He is still a Zimbabwean citizen. Club career =Northampton Saints= Mujati joined Saints in 2009 making his debut at Wembley Stadium. A second-half try for Mujati against Saracens helped the Saints reach the 2009-10 LV= Cup final and by the end of the campaign he was a regular sight on the first team field. The continuation of his fine form into 2010/11 was all the more impressive and he marked himself out as the cornerstone of a formidable Saints pack, featuring in every Premiership and Heineken Cup fixture. After confirming himself as Europe's premium tight-head and a fans favourite to boot, 'Mooj' was voted Players' Player of the Season and selected in the Sky Sports and ESPN Premiership Dream Team. He also finished second only to team mate Tom Wood in the Aviva Premiership Player of the Season vote. Though Brian struggled to find consistency early in 2012/13, his run to form was timed perfectly and he would contribute a semi-final try as the Saints stormed to the Premiership Final at Twickenham. =Racing 92= On 27 November 2012, it was announced Mujati would leave Northampton Saints to join French club Racing 92 for the 2013‚Äì14 season. Mujati spent two years at the french side. He amassed over 50 caps for the club before signing for the Sale Sharks on a two-year contract in September 2015. =Sale Sharks= Mujati made his Sale debut in October 2015 in a defeat to Saracens. He scored his first points for the club in a European Challenge Cup match against French side Pau. =Ospreys= In January 2017, Brian Mujati joined the Welsh Pro12 club Ospreys until the end of the season. On 25 February 2017, he made his debut for Ospreys against Glasgow Warriors in a 26-15 win. On 7 May 2017, Brian signed a contract extension, which was to see him stay at the Ospreys for a second season (2017-2018); however shortly into his second season at the Ospreys Mujati was forced to retire following a shoulder injury . International career =South Africa= Despite being Zimbabwean-born Mujati made 12 appearances for the Springboks during the 2008 season prior to leaving for Northampton in 2009. Personal life Away from the rugby pitch Brian has proved himself to be a vlogger, with a video channel on YouTube called The Life Of Brian. He is married to Chenesai Mujati and together they have 3 children - 2 daughters and a son. Brian is also a keen brewer and has been making beer for several years.

It opened in 1831. History The Trent and Mersey Canal was authorised by an Act of Parliament in 1766, and construction began at once. After rising through 40 locks from Shardlow on the River Trent, the canal had a short summit section, most of which was through the Harecastle Tunnel, before it began its descent through another 36 locks to reach Preston Brook and the Bridgewater Canal. It was completed in 1777. From the time of its opening, there were plans for a canal through Macclesfield, but no firm action was taken until 1824. Thomas Telford produced a survey in 1825, and an Act of Parliament was obtained in 1826, but although it was based on Telford's design, he did not oversee the work, which was managed by William Crosley. At the same time, Brindley's original tunnel at Harecastle was sinking, and Telford's new tunnel was authorised in 1823, which would be larger than the old one, and would incorporate a towpath. It was slightly longer, at but was completed in just over two years, opening on 16 March 1827. The Trent and Mersey were keen to ensure that none of their limited water supply was lost to the Macclesfield Canal, and obtained an Act of Parliament in 1827, which gave them powers to build the first of it, to Hall Green Stop Lock. They insisted that the water level of the Macclesfield canal should be maintained higher than their section, which was known as the Hall Green Branch, so that water passed from the Macclesfield Canal, rather than to it. The canal, and hence the junction, opened in 1831. Location The junction lies close to the northern portal of the Harecastle Tunnel. The Trent and Mersey Canal turns to the west after leaving the tunnel, and the Hall Green Branch initially turns off to the south. There is a sharp right- hand bend, after which it runs parallel to the main line, which descends through two locks. There is then another sharp right-hand bend, and the branch crosses over the main line on an aqueduct. The Macclesfield Canal is long from the stop lock to Marple Junction, and ascends through a single flight of 12 locks, located from the stop lock. Since both canals are now managed by British Waterways, the Hall Green Branch is usually considered to be part of the Macclesfield Canal. The summit level of the Trent and Mersey is long, and ends close to the junction at lock 41. Travelling south, the other end of the summit is at lock 40, just after Etruria Junction, where the Caldon Canal joins the main line.

He served King Charles in many posts including secretary of state, but on the outbreak of the English Civil War joined the Parliamentary cause. He was the third cousin of Francis Fane, 1st Earl of Westmorland. Origins and education Vane was the eldest son of Henry Vane or Fane of Hadlow, Kent, by his second wife, Margaret, daughter of Roger Twysden of East Peckham, Kent, and Anne Wyatt. He matriculated from Brasenose College, Oxford, on 15 June 1604, was admitted a student of Gray's Inn in 1606. He was knighted by James I on 3 March 1611.Firth in DNB. Political advancement At the age of twenty- three he married Frances Darcy, daughter of Thomas Darcy of Tolleshurst Darcy, Essex. Immediately after his marriage, writes Vane in an autobiographical sketch, 'I put myself into court, and bought a carver's place by means of the friendship of Sir Thomas Overbury, which cost me ¬£5,000.' Next year he devoted the ¬£3,000 of his wife's portion to purchasing from Sir Edward Gorges a third part of the subpoena office in chancery, and later so ingratiated himself with the king that James gave him the reversion of the whole office for forty years. In 1617 Sir David Foulis sold him the post of cofferer to the Prince of Wales, and he continued to hold this office after Charles had become king. In about 1629 he became Comptroller of the Household in place of John, first baron Savile. Finally, in September 1639 he was made Treasurer of the Household. Vane's career at court was interrupted by a quarrel with Buckingham, from whom he underwent 'some severe mortification' mentioned by Clarendon, but he made his peace with Buckingham, and after Buckingham's death was in high favour with Lord-treasurer Weston. In 1614, Vane was elected Member of Parliament for Lostwithiel. He was elected MP for Carlisle in 1621, and was re-elected in 1624, 1625 and 1626. However he took no important part in the debates of the House of Commons of England. In February and again in September 1629, and in 1630, King Charles sent Vane to Holland in the hope of negotiating a peace between the United Provinces and Spain, and obtaining the restoration of the Electorate of the Palatinate by Spanish means. In September 1631 Vane was sent to Germany to negotiate with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden. As King Charles merely offered the king of Sweden ¬£10,000 per month, and expected him to pledge himself to restore the palatinate, Gustavus rejected the proposed alliance. Vane's negotiations were also hindered by a personal quarrel with Gustavus, but he gave great satisfaction to his own master. Cottington wrote to Vane \\"Through your wise and dexterous carriage of that great business, you have saved his majesty's money and his honour\\". A letter from Sir Tobie Matthew to Vane, written about the same time, adds further testimony of Vane's favour at court. Clarendon, who is throughout very hostile to Vane, describes him as a man 'of very ordinary parts by nature, and he had not cultivated them at all by art, for he was very illiterate. But being of a stirring and boisterous disposition, very industrious and very bold, he still wrought himself into some employment.' thumb300pxRaby Castle, which became the principal northern residence of Henry Vane \\\\---- From Jones' Views of the Seats of Noblemen and Gentlemen, (1819). Clarendon continues that for the office of controller and similar court offices, Vane was very fit, and if he had never taken other preferment he might probably have continued a good subject, for he had no inclination to change, and in the judgment he had liked the government both of church and state, and only desired to raise his fortune, which was not great, and which he found many ways to improve'. Vane began life with a landed estate of ¬£460 per annum; in 1640 he was the owner of lands worth ¬£3,000 a year. He had sold his ancestral estate of Hadlow, and bought in its place Fairlawne in Kent, at a cost of about ¬£4,000. He also purchased the seignories of Raby, Barnard Castle, and Long Newton in the county of Durham, at a cost of about ¬£18,000. Vane's political importance dates from 1630, when he became a member of the privy council. Sir Thomas Roe describes him about that time, in a letter to the Queen of Bohemia, as being 'of the cabinet,' that is, one of those councillors in whom the king most confided. On 20 November 1632 he was appointed one of the commissioners of the admiralty. In May 1633 he entertained the king at Raby. In 1635 he was granted the wardenship of all forests and chases within the dominion of Barnard Castle, and in the following year the custody of Teesdale Forest and Manwood Chase. On 10 April 1636 Vane was appointed one of the commissioners for the colonies, and between 1630 and 1640 he was continually employed on different administrative commissions. When the disturbances began in Scotland he was appointed one of the eight privy councillors to whom Scottish affairs were entrusted, and was one of the peace party in that committee. On 3 February 1640 the king, to the general surprise, appointed Vane secretary of state in place of Sir John Coke. This was effected, in spite of Strafford's opposition, 'by the dark contrivance of the Marquis of Hamilton and by the open and visible power of the Queen.' Quarrel with the Earl of Strafford Thomas Wentworth, 1st Earl of Strafford, about 1639, portrait by van Dyck The intimacy between Vane and Lord Hamilton dated from Vane's mission to Germany, and increased during the first Scottish war, when Vane was the intermediary between Hamilton and the king. Vane had been for some time on apparently friendly terms with Strafford, but the mismanagement of the war against the Scots, and differences as to the policy to be pursued towards them in the future, caused a breach. It became permanent when Strafford on his creation as an earl (12 January 1640) selected Baron Raby as his second title, ‚Äòa house,' says Clarendon, ‚Äòbelonging to Sir H. Vane, and an honour he made an account should belong to him too.' This, continues Clarendon, was an act 'of the most unnecessary provocation' on Strafford's part, 'though he contemned the man with marvellous scorn ‚Ä¶ and I believe was the loss of his head'. In April 1640, Vane was elected MP for Wilton in the Short Parliament. At the first meeting he was charged to demand supplies for the war from the commons. On 4 May he informed the house that the king was willing to surrender ship-money, adding that his master would not be satisfied with less than twelve subsidies in return. The debate showed that the king's demand would be refused, and led to the dissolution of parliament on 5 May. Clarendon, who attributes the breach entirely to Vane's mismanagement, charges him with misrepresenting the temper of parliament to the king, and even with \\"acting that part maliciously, and to bring all into confusion\\" in order to compass Strafford's ruin. Another contemporary rumour was that Vane brought about the dissolution in order to save himself from prosecution as a monopolist. But Vane was evidently acting by the king's instructions, and Clarendon omits to mention the dispute about the military charges and the intended vote against the Scottish war which complicated the question at issue. The king did not regard Vane as going beyond his orders, and continued to employ him as secretary. Throughout the second Scottish war Vane was with the king, and his letters show that he was full of confidence even after the defeat at the Battle of Newburn. Vane took part as an assistant in the debates of the great council and in the negotiations with the Scots at Ripon. He was re-elected MP for Wilton in November 1640 for the Long Parliament where he was fortunate enough to escape attack. This he owed partly to the fact that he had not been concerned in the most obnoxious acts of the government, partly to his son's connection with the opposition leaders. In Strafford's trial Vane's evidence as to the words used by him in the meeting of the privy council on 5 May 1640 was of paramount importance. He asserted positively that Strafford had advised an offensive war with Scotland, telling the king, \\"You have an army in Ireland; you may employ it to reduce this kingdom.\\" In the theory of the prosecution \\"this kingdom\\" meant England, not Scotland, and Vane declined to offer any explanation of the words, though much pressed by Strafford's friends. Other privy councillors present could not remember the words, but Vane persisted in his statement, relying doubtless on the notes of the discussion which he had taken at the time. The notes themselves had been seen by the king and burnt by his orders a short time before the meeting of the parliament, but on 10 April John Pym produced a copy which he had obtained from the younger Vane, which corroborated the secretary's evidence. Vane owned the notes, but refused further explanations, and expressed great wrath with his son. Clarendon regards Vane's anger as a comedy played to deceive the public, but admits that for some time after \\"there was in public a great distance observed between them.\\" There is no evidence, however, to justify either this theory of collusion, or the further statement that Vane had been throughout the trial the secret assistant of the prosecution. Dismissal by the King Vane thought that Strafford's attainder would reconcile king and people. He commented \\"God send us now a happy end of our troubles and a good peace\\" on the passing of the bill. He did not see that it put an end to his prospects of remaining in the king's service, as its effects were for a time delayed by the difficulty of finding a suitable successor. He was even appointed one of the five commissioners of the treasury when William Juxon resigned in May 1641. In August 1641 Vane accompanied Charles I to Scotland, and as no successor to Francis Windebank, his former colleague in the secretaryship, had yet been appointed, he was charged to correspond with (Sir) Edward Nicholas, clerk of the council. His letters during this period are printed in the ‚ÄòNicholas Papers'. Although his post as treasurer of the household had already been promised to Thomas, second baron Savile (afterwards Earl of Sussex), he was confident that he should keep both it and the secretaryship. But as soon as Charles returned to London he gave the treasurership to Savile, and a few days later dismissed Vane from the secretaryship and all other posts at court (November 1641). It was remarked at the time that Vane had \\"the very ill luck to be neither loved nor pitied of any man,\\" and the king was convinced of his treachery. Parliamentarian Vane soon joined the opposition. On 13 December 1641 Pym moved that Vane's name should be added to the committee of thirty-two for Irish affairs. Two months later, when the militia bill was drawn up, parliament nominated Vane as lord lieutenant of Durham (10 February 1642). When the civil war broke out, Durham, which was predominantly royalist in feeling, fell at once under the control of the Royalists, and Vane exercised no real authority there till after its reconquest at the end of 1644. John Lilburne who was bitterly hostile to all the Vanes because Sir Henry had been one of his judges, accused him of causing the loss of Durham by negligence and treachery, but the charge met with no belief from parliament. Vane was a member of the Committee of Both Kingdoms from its first establishment (7 February 1644). In April 1645 he was employed as one of its representatives with the Scottish auxiliary army. At the Treaty of Uxbridge Parliament asked the king to make Vane a baron, his favour with the parliament is shown by the ordinances for the payment of his losses during the war. These losses were very considerable, as Raby was three times occupied by the Royalists, and after its recapture became a parliamentary garrison. Vane says, probably with truth, \\"In my losses, plunderings, rents, and destructions of timber in my woods, I have been damnified to the amount of ¬£16,000 at least\\". Vane sat in the Rump Parliament after Pride's Purge in December 1648, but a proposal to appoint him a member of the English Council of State in February 1650 was rejected by the house. He was elected MP for Kent in the First Protectorate Parliament. Vane died at the age of about 66 in or around May 1655. Royalists reported that he had committed suicide, through remorse for his share in Strafford's death. His widow, Frances, lady Vane, died on 2 August 1663, aged 72, and was buried at Shipbourne, Kent. Portraits of Vane and his wife were painted by Van Dyck. Children Vane's eldest son, Sir Henry (1613‚Äì1662), was a Puritan statesman, sixth colonial governor of Massachusetts, Secretary of the Navy, President of the Committee on Safety and one of the most significant leaders of the Long Parliament.Charles Wentworth Upham, in the American Biography, edited by Jared Sparks, Sir Henry Vane the Younger, Fourth Colonial Governor of Massachusetts George, the second son, born in 1618, was knighted on 22 November 1640. He was parliamentary High Sheriff of Durham in September 1645, and apparently treasurer of the committee for the county. Many of his letters to his father on the affairs of the county are printed in the calendar of domestic state papers. He married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of Sir Lionel Maddison of Rogerly, Durham, and was buried at Long Newton in the same county on 1 May 1679. Charles, the fourth son, matriculated at Magdalen College, Oxford, on 17 March 1637. On 16 January 1650 the parliament appointed him agent of the Commonwealth at Lisbon, in which capacity he demanded Prince Rupert's expulsion from Portuguese ports, but was obliged to leave and take refuge on board Blake's fleet. Two other sons, William and Walter, were soldiers in the Dutch service. Walter, who was knighted, seems to have been royalist in his sympathies, and a large number of intercepted letters from him to friends in England are printed in the 'Thurloe Papers.' In 1665 Charles II employed him as envoy to the elector of Brandenburg. Vane was colonel of a Regiment of Foot in the English service in 1667, and on 12 August 1668 was appointed colonel of what was known as the Holland regiment. He was killed serving under the Prince of Orange at the Battle of Seneffe in August 1674, and was buried at the Hague. Of Vane's daughters, Margaret married Sir Thomas Pelham, 2nd Baronet of Halland, Sussex; Frances married Sir Robert Honeywood of Pett, Sussex; Anne married Sir Thomas Liddell of Ravensworth, Durham; Elizabeth married Sir Francis Vincent of Stoke d'Abernon, Surrey.

It is one of the oldest cultural landscapes in the East Alpine region. Geography It is from to wide and about long, with an elevation between above sea level. It is situated in the larger Klagenfurt Basin of the Central Eastern Alps and extends along the Glan River from north of Klagenfurt to Sankt Veit an der Glan. The plain is confined by surrounded by four prominent peaks of the basin: the Ulrichsberg () in the south and the Magdalensberg () in the east as well as the G√∂√üeberg () and the Lorenziberg in the north (). Since about 500 years the mountains are stops on the annual Vierbergelauf procession celebrated on second Friday after Easter. History Roman stone relief on the outer wall of the Church of Our Lady in Maria Saal The oldest archaeological findings at Magdalensberg originate from the time of Hallstatt culture (8th to 6th centuries BCE). The area was the cultural and political centre of the Celtic kingdom and the later Roman province of Noricum, when under the rule of Emperor Claudius (41-54 AD) the city of Virunum was established as the province's capital, replacing - or maybe identical with - ancient Noreia. Following the Slavic settlement of the Eastern Alps about 600, the Karnburg (Krnski grad) fortress became the center of the Principality of Carantania, which about 740 was vassalized by Duke Odilo of Bavaria. With Bavaria a part of the Carolingian Empire under Charlemagne from 788 onwards, a Kaiserpfalz at Karnburg was erected about 830. It remained the administrative center after the Duchy of Carinthia had been split off Bavaria in 976. Inside the castle was a meeting place, where the Prince's Stone, the base of an ancient Roman Ionic column, stood and the Dukes of Carantania were installed. Near Maria Saal stands the Duke's Chair, where the newly installed dukes distributed their land among the vassals.

The population of the civil parish at the 2011 census was 505. It lies south of Ilkeston and north of Sandiacre. Since 1974 it has been part of the Erewash borough. The village is halfway between the cities of Derby and Nottingham, being 6.9 miles, as the crow flies, from each city. Early history Mentioned in the Domesday Book Survey of 1086, Stanton-by-Dale is believed to derive its name from stone quarrying in the area. During the 13th and 14th centuries the church and much land in the parish was owned by nearby Dale (Stanley Park) Abbey. After its dissolution in 1538, the Abbey's property in Stanton was granted to the Babington family. In Elizabethan times, this was sold on to Michael Willoughby of Risley. Many local buildings contain stone which originated as part of the Abbey. St Michael's Church dates from about 1300, although it is not certain whether there was an earlier church on this site. The tower is fifteenth century. Stanton and the Ironworks Earl Stanhope became Lord of the Manor in the eighteenth Century, eventually selling the parish to the Stanton Ironworks Company. Only workers at the Ironworks, a major local employer which dominated the area for over two centuries, were allowed to live in Stanton owned properties. In later years these houses were all painted 'Stanton Green', a colour still evident in the village. Stanton Ironworks became an international company as Stanton & Staveley, was nationalised as part of British Steel Corporation, de- nationalised and sold eventually to the French Saint-Gobain company. Production ceased at the works in 2007. It is commemorated throughout the UK and further afield by the many thousands of manhole covers and concrete street lamp standards bearing the words ‚ÄôStanton‚Äô or ‚ÄôStanton and Staveley‚Äô.

The Haitian Educational System yields the lowest total rate in the education realm of the Western Hemisphere.Haiti country profile. Library of Congress Federal Research Division (May 2006). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Haiti's literacy rate of about 61% (64.3% for males and 57.3% for females) is below the 90% average literacy rate for Latin American and Caribbean countries. The country faces shortages in educational supplies and qualified teachers. The rural population is less educated than the urban. The 2010 Haiti earthquake exacerbated the already constrained parameters on Haiti's educational system by destroying infrastructure and displacing 50‚Äì90% of the students, depending on locale. International private schools (run by Canada, France, or the United States) and church-run schools educate 90% of students. Haiti has 15,200 primary schools, of which 90% are non-public and managed by communities, religious organizations or NGOs. The enrollment rate for primary school is 88%. Secondary schools enroll 20% of eligible-age children. Higher education is provided by universities and other public and private institutions. The educational sector is under the responsibility of the Ministre de l'√âducation Nationale et de la Formation Professionnelle (MENFP). The Ministry provides very little funds to support public education. As a result, the private sector has become a substitute for governmental public investment in education as opposed to an addition.Salmi, Jamil. 2000. \\"Equity and Quality in Private Education: the Haitian paradox.\\" A Journal of Comparative Education 30:163‚Äì178. The Ministry is limited in its ability to improve the quality of education in Haiti.Luzincourt, K., & Gulbrandson, J. 2010. Education and Conflict in Haiti. Retrieved 30 October 2012. Despite the deficiencies of the Haitian education sector, some Haitian leaders have attempted to make improving education a national goal. The country has attempted three major reform efforts, with a new one in progress as a response to the earthquake. History =Pre-independence= \\"African slaves were worked so hard by French plantation owners that half died within a few years; it was cheaper to import new slaves than to improve working conditions enough to increase survival. This attitude allowed no time or resources for the education of the enslaved. Children of slaveholders were tutored in the early grades at home and then sent to France for further study. There were few schools in Saint Domingue. At the time of independence, years of war had demolished most infrastructure including any educational facilities. =Independence through the 1800s= At the beginning of independence, King Christophe in the north of Haiti looked to Englishman William Wilberforce to build up the new nation's educational system. King Christophe, though illiterate, understood the necessity of education. He was keen to show that formerly enslaved educated persons could hold their own with the educated of the world. Wilburforce encouraged Prince Saunders of Boston as well as four others to join their efforts at developing a Lancastrian model of education. This is a Monitorial System where the teacher teaches the more advanced students who then in turn teach the less advanced. It is designed to educate a large number of students without benefit of a large number of professional teachers. In the south of Haiti, President Alexandre P√©tion turned to the French to guide his development of the educational system. He was personally familiar with it since he had studied ballistics in France. His approach to the issue of inadequate numbers of teachers for the primary grades was to focus on secondary education in the Napoleonic approach to education. The first Constitution, promulgated in 1805 by King Christophe, stated that \\"... education shall be free. Primary education shall be compulsory... State education shall be free at every level.\\" It guaranteed the right for everyone to teach ‚Äìan \\"open-door policy\\" to private initiativesAl-Bataineh, Adel T and Mohamed A. Nur-Awaleh. 2005.

Haitian Diaspora and Education Reform. 2011. Columbia University. Haiti Government. 1801. Haiti Constitution of 1801. Retrieved 24 November 2012. The practice of providing accessible public education for all was established later when the Constitution was revised in 1807. In 1987, the declaration that education was a right for every citizen was added to the Constitution.Haiti Government. 1987. Haiti Constitution 1987. Retrieved 24 November 2012. (These educational goals expressed in the Constitution have not been achieved. In the beginning, the government's primary focus was on building schools to serve the children of the political elite. These schools were predominantly found in urban areas, and patterned after the French and British school models. At the end of the 19th century, there were 350 public schools in the country. It rose to approximately 730 by the eve of the American Occupation of Haiti in 1917.) =The American Occupation of 1915‚Äì1934= At the beginning of the United States occupation of Haiti there was an effort by the U.S. military to improve the education but not to the degree to which they had in the previous countries that they had occupied such as Cuba or the Puerto Rico. Their initial assessment of the Haitian educational system was similar to many that had been made before. The solution of the military, as first understood ‚Äì of broadening the type of education and opening it up to more of the population, was considered a positive change by many Haitians as well as a number of American editorial writers who were keeping an eye on Haiti. The most basic issue was that the current educational system did not successfully educate the average Haitian who spoke only Haitian Creole. The Haitian education system was built on the idea of the superiority of the French language over any other language, and the profound inferiority of Haitian culture to that of the French culture. This concept of superiority were born in the minds of the elite during the years of slavery and were re-enforced when the French Catholic Church was allowed to return and begin establishing schools as a result of the Concordat of 1860. The classical education, more commonly called an \\"academic\\" education was meant to prepare the elite for further education in France. There was heavy emphasis on the literature of France and rhetoric and very little science or practical education such as engineering and the learning tended to be rote. The language of instruction was French which was further re-enforced at home, among friends and in their reading materials down to food labels in their pantries. Non-elite students did not have the benefit of speaking French at home. In the schools that served the non-elite, French was still the language of instruction but there was a good chance the teacher was not fluent and the teaching became even more rote. Further down the social ladder, the quality of the teacher's either Creole or French was even less certain. To ensure universal education for all, it was clear that profound, deep, systemic changes would need to begin. The Occupation's solution, however, was different than prior attempts at repair in that there was to be a new and extreme emphasis on agricultural education over the traditional academic education that the elites received. The decision process surrounding this move to agricultural education and its implementation caused a great deal of concern and controversy in Haiti as well as in the U.S. ‚Äì particularly among black American leaders. To them it smacked of attempts in the southern United States to limit black citizens to simple agricultural training to keep them from moving up the social economic ladder and to keep them from moving into a profession or positions of leadership. (Note that there was an ongoing debate in the United States among leaders of black people at the time about the best educational path for black Americans ‚Äì see the discussions between Booker T. Washington and W.E.B. Dubois [ whose father had been born in Haiti.] ‚Äì however no black leader advocated for solely agricultural training.) US. black leaders discovered that the U.S. decision makers in Haiti were all white military men ‚Äì the majority of whom were southerners raised with Jim Crow laws. Concerns were raised about systemic racism such that one such leader Rayford W. Logan ‚Äì an American French speaking advocate of Pan-Africanism ‚Äì went on a fact finding mission, traveling much of the country and examining documents published by the Occupational forces. While there was no systematic record- keeping for all the Occupation years or for all the other efforts in the occupied countries, he was able to see clear patterns of denial of funds and minimization of Haitian culture. He concluded that the occupation's educational efforts were failing due to issues related to racism ‚Äì some subtle and some blatant. In the initial treaty with Haiti no mention was explicitly made of educational improvements or policy as had been done in the Philippines, Cuba and Puerto Rico. Rayford considered this \\"an almost inexplicable omission\\". The Occupation budget for education in Haiti in 1920 paled in comparison to previous amounts allocated in other occupied countries. (Note that all monies for education came out of the Haitian treasury ‚Äì there were no monies forthcoming from the United States.) * Haiti had $340,000. * Cuba had 20 times the budget ($7,000,000) for the same number of people. * Puerto Rico had 11 times the budget ($4,000,000) with half the people of Haiti. * Dominican Republic had 5 times the budget ($1,500,000) with a third of the people. While the U.S. was in the Dominican Republic, the salary of a teacher there had increased from $5 to $10 a month to $55 a month. Dominican rural schools had increased in number from 84 before the occupation to 489 in 1921. Logan attributed this disparity to racism, even though citizens of both countries were descended from African slaves. The Dominican Republic citizens described themselves as white people or mulatto while Haitians described themselves as black or mulatto. In Haiti, the Occupation had essentially developed two school systems ‚Äì one run by the U.S. ‚Äì the agricultural sector called the Service Technique (or Technical Service) and the one run by the Haitian government ‚Äì the academic from the elite lycee schools to the primary school in the mountain villages. The implementation of the Service Techniques was highly problematic. The classes were taught by American teachers ‚Äì few of whom spoke French let alone Haitian Creole. This required most classes to use translators which slowed down the teaching process considerably and added another cost. Logan found that the salary differentials were such that Haitian primary school teachers were paid $72 a year while the American inspector of schools in that local area was paid between $1800 and $2400 a year. Academic schools were clearly deprived of funds while agricultural schools were generously funded. The Americans paid little attention to rural schools ‚Äì home of the vast majority of Haitians. After 13 years of Occupation there were only a third of the rural schools ‚Äì 306 ‚Äì as opposed to the 1074 required by the Haiti law of 1912. There was also a dearth of government owned school buildings ‚Äì Haiti had much more of a deficit in numbers of school buildings than other countries the U.S. had occupied. In the Philippines, the Occupation had built 1000 schools; in Cuba, 2600 schools with attendance jumping from 21,000 to 215,000. Given the concern about European influence in the Caribbean prior to World War I it is not surprising that Occupation forces wanted to diminish the influence of the Germans and French in Haitian life. Germans controlled important parts of the economy but it was the French who controlled the culture. It was much easier to replace the Germans with American businessmen but there was not an easy replacement for the French way of life. When the Haitian government asked that French Trappists (one of Catholicism's holy orders) be allowed to provide schooling, they were denied ‚Äì even though this would have been a less expensive method of education. There was also a deep concern surrounding the separation of church and state among the Occupation leaders because it did not fit the model of American democracy. In the Americans' view the Catholic Church was intertwined with French influence and its reach into Haitian society needed to be reduced even though this would negatively affect academic education. At one point, two French professors were denied the ability to teach and the French Ambassador to the United States made an official complaint. It was the hope of the Occupation to reduce cultural reliance on the French but the American military badly underestimated the intellectual, language and emotional ties to France among the elite. There were some elite who at the beginning of the Occupation offered support for the Occupation's educational efforts but once it became it clear that there would not only be no support for the academic schools, that many of them would actually be closed ‚Äì the elite became increasingly anti-American. While many in Haiti had a plethora of reasons to be frustrated with the Occupation it was actually students who instigated the final demonstrations against the Americans that finally forced them out. They had been promised scholarships to the Service Technique but did not receive them. It was the straw that broke the camel's back and began the revolt that ended the Occupation in 1934. =Post Occupation (1931‚Äì1946)= Rural Education Although the American Occupation officially ended in 1934 (with some aspects, such as finance and customs, actually continuing until 1947), the U.S. personnel running the Technical Service of Agriculture and Vocational Education (Service Technique de l'Agriculture et de l'Enseignement Professionnel) left in October 1931. Important changes in rural education began to be effected following their departure and the naming of Maurice Dartigue as Director of Rural Education (from 1931 to 1941). Significant innovations in urban education were made later when Dartigue was appointed Minister of Public Instruction, Agriculture and Labor, serving from 1941 to late 1945. Initially, the Haitian Government was faced with a dilemma: where to house this service that the Occupation had created. The antiquated Department of Public Instruction was deemed unsuitable, as it had not been reorganized at any time in the past decade. As a result, the Technical Service was split in two, forming the National Service of Agricultural Production and Rural Education (Service National de la Production Agricole et de l'Enseignemnt Rural), under the Department of Agriculture, and the National Service of Vocational Education (Service National de l'Enseignement Professionnel), placed under the Department of Labor. Since the Haitian educational system had been based wholly on a French curriculum, reflecting a classical approach, with courses in French, using French texts, the country now had the opportunity of a brand-new start that would make the education Haitian, modern, professional, and democratic. The Haitianization of the system meant that Haitians would take the place of American teachers and administrators formerly in charge of the rural and vocational schools and that students would be presented with an approach to education that was relevant to their needs and to their milieu, a truly revolutionary concept for Haiti. This was augmented with books written specifically for Haitian children by rural-education specialists, including the ground-breaking G√©ographie locale (Local Geography) by Maurice Dartigue and Andr√© Liautaud, and in that same year (1931) Dartigue's civics textbook, Les Probl√®mes de la Communaut√© (The Problems of the Community), to help form good citizens. This was also a chance to introduce a modern curriculum, one that combined a practical foundation in agriculture and manual trades with \\"book learning,\\" i.e., the three Rs, elements of Haitian history and geography, social sciences, hygiene, and physical education ‚Äì subjects that were of relevance to the children and their environment. It was also an opportunity to establish new teaching methods and for teachers to undergo proper training and, in many cases, retraining. Prior to 1931, the prevalent opinion had been that any individual with a certain amount of culture was capable of working in the various fields of education. This ignored the fact that education is both an art and a science that can only be organized and directed by competent specialists. The proper formation of teachers would also lead to the professionalization of education and to providing status and dignity for the profession. The aim of the new education was to reach everyone. No longer would the system cater only to the 10% that had a mastery of French, while the other 90% ‚Äî principally the country's rural citizens ‚Äì remained largely illiterate. Education would finally be democratic and might lead to a democratic society. Children of all classes of society, all on an equal footing, would have the same opportunity for learning and for advancement in a land with a strict caste system that the peasantry could presently never escape. Maurice Dartigue was a graduate of the Central School of Agriculture (which the Americans had established in 1924); had spent five years working for the Technical Service; and had earned a master's degree in rural education from Columbia University's Teachers College in New York. The reforms he undertook to revolutionize Haiti's rural educational system included many firsts. The initial step was to conduct a comprehensive survey throughout the country, the statistical data from which was analyzed and used to evaluate the system's present and future needs and budgets. The survey revealed that conditions quoted in official reports and statements made by Haitian educators and intellectuals from 1884 to 1914 were still the same in 1931. As had been shown in 1892 (when the then-Minister of Public Instruction had indicated that most of the rural schools listed were in fact non- existent), any number of schools were still only on paper while quite a number consisted only of a rudimentary tonnelle (a shelter) with three or four benches. Very few, if any, had ever received supplies from the Department of Public Instruction. The exact location of many schools was unknown to the central office in Port-au-Prince and even to the district inspectors. In a number of cases, teachers stayed away from work for three, four or even six months a year. Those instructors who were found in their schools or could be reached during the survey were given a simple elementary test. Most of them were judged practically illiterate and unable to do basic arithmetic: they were absolutely incompetent. The results of the survey demonstrated that it was not the fault of the peasants if they did not benefit from the rural schools allegedly established since 1860. The peasant was untutored not only in what we understand to be basic education (the three Rs) but also in the ways of the earth as to irrigation, fertilization, seed selection, crop rotation, terracing, reforestation, soil erosion, conservation, standardization for marketing, and the like, because up to this time no educational system had tried to give him the mental and technical equipment necessary to cope adequately with his problems. Meeting these problems head-on and solving them intelligently required a certain kind of instruction, a specific type of schooling, whereby economic proficiency was viewed as more important than literacy. The emphasis on economic competence needed to aim at creating earning power for the peasant. Schooling was also meant to develop in the peasantry reliability, responsibility, and leadership. In addition to imparting technical skills, it was necessary for the peasant's education to expose him to and provide training in the cultural, civic, and social aspects of his immediate world and the larger one of the Haitian nation. It was important to instill a unifying culture in the peasantry, to create a sense of the nation they belonged to, to have them embrace the values and qualities that could, with the middle and upper classes, join them into one society. Rural education essentially meant primary schooling and was to cover a period of six years. Not only did it constitute the foundation of the educational system, but for the majority of rural students, it was all the education they were going to get because it was unlikely they would continue with further studies. It was therefore imperative that the pupils be given a minimum of knowledge. Dartigue advocated a scientific approach to education and the application of the principles of pedagogy. For the first time, Haiti now had a rural educational system based on a philosophy of education and not on a blind imitation of foreign (i.e., French) programs. The education of girls was also deemed of great importance, for if there was to be improvement in peasant life, girls had to be schooled because progress, particularly social progress, is closely connected with the education of women. The number of schools for girls was increased, as were the number of mixed schools (girls and boys together), and more women were encouraged to enter the teaching profession. Programs were undertaken to involve parents and the rest of the community in the idea of rural education as a way for adults to understand its purpose and value, not only for the children but for themselves as well. A vital bond needed to be established between the school and the community by centering as much as possible the life of the community around the rural schools so that they might exert an influence toward social and economic improvement of the community. This outreach was a new concept for Haiti. Recreational programs for children and parents were begun. Parent associations were formed and regular meetings held to discuss the problems of the school and the community. County agricultural agents explained newly enacted laws and regulations regarding agriculture and advised on the planting of crops, methods of cultivation, and marketing. They demonstrated good agricultural practices, and many seedlings and thousands of seeds were distributed free of charge. The peasants were also encouraged to bring their tools to be repaired in the school shop, and agricultural implements were sold at cost to the peasants of certain regions, while modern silos were built in different areas to conserve grain and stabilize prices throughout the year. Gradually, teachers and pupils, with the occasional aid of some of the adults, pursued projects in the community, such as drainage, cleaning water springs, and building latrines. Civics was introduced into the rural-school curriculum to foster national pride in being part of the nation. To this end, the Haitian flag was placed in the courtyard of each school, and the students were led in singing the national anthem every morning at the start of the school day. The importance of creating a distinctive, authentic, original Haitian culture that sought to unify the disparate segments of society was stressed, and so Haitian folklore, music and art were added to the school day. Whereas Creole had been used in the lower elementary grades in the oral teaching of agriculture, health, manual arts, and elementary arithmetic, except in the last two most advanced grades, all written work had been done in French. The goal now was to increase literacy and facilitate schoolwork in general by having all the academic work, written and oral, in the first two or three grades of the rural schools conducted in Creole. This allowed the vast number of rural children, who were non-French speakers, to understand what they were being taught and to provide a comfortable and gradual bridge to their subsequent studies in French. All the incompetent instructors were fired and replaced with those chosen through educational credentials or competitive exams. A cadre of civil-service specialists was created who would remain a constant in and carry on the work and progress of the Division of Rural Education, regardless of who was at the helm. This would be possible because one of Dartigue's most important reforms was to ban political patronage from the Division, allowing educators to obtain and maintain their positions through competence and experience. There was no question of reforming rural education on a scientific and practical basis without specialists in this field with a proper preparation not only in education and the science of education but in sociology and educational psychology. Grants for overseas study (mostly in the United States but also in Canada and Puerto Rico) were arranged to permit teachers, principals, directors, statisticians and the like to complete and perfect their education and training. A new type of teacher training (pre-service and in-service training, plus summer courses) was developed, and new methods in teaching a new curriculum were introduced that allowed for a practical education that would instruct rural students in the basics of agriculture and manual training, along with the three Rs. Many of the schools were in very bad physical condition. The best accommodations that could be found in each community were rented to house the schools, based on suitability and not on favoritism as in the past. Others were repaired while some were built from scratch by teachers and students pitching in together. School furniture was made or repaired, mostly in the shops of the farm-schools, thus providing the teachers and pupils of these institutions with a chance to engage in practical and useful projects. Essential school materials (e.g., blackboards, pencils, chalk, books, paper) were distributed. Mobile teams were created to go into the countryside to assist teachers; refresh their knowledge, teaching methods and curriculum; and reinforce the feeling of being part of the Division of Rural Education from which they were geographically isolated. The teams also discussed local problems with the teachers and tried to help them arrive at solutions. There was throughout Haitian society a strong stigma attached to manual labor which Dartigue sought to remove by encouraging the pursuit of vocational skills in trade schools and to develop an appreciation of the value of farming (given Haiti's largely agrarian society). Before 1932, the teaching of trades and agriculture was absolutely unknown in the rural schools. At the end of the academic year 1934‚Äì35, trades were practiced in all the rural schools at least some of the year. A special supervisor of manual trades and two supervisors of agriculture were sent to the various districts to help the local supervisors. Having a manual skill would be enriching to the peasant and would widen his horizons; it would also give him something with which to occupy himself in the dry season and would be a source of added revenue. From 1936 on, there began in earnest a campaign of reforestation to counteract the indiscriminate felling of trees for charcoal (a truly catastrophic situation today) through the designation of an official Arbor Day that involved the planting of trees. Teachers attended courses in the subject, including the causes of deforestation, that they then transmitted to their students. Beginning in 1931, major changes were made in the way rural education was structured. The National Service of Agricultural Production and Rural Education was divided in two, with one part being a reorganized Division of Rural Education (whose antecedent had come into being with the formation of the farm-schools under the Americans in the 1920s). The Central School of Agriculture, which had closed in 1930 on the heels of a student strike, was now re-opened, installed under the Division, and overhauled, with an agricultural section for the formation of agronomists and an agricultural- teaching section for the preparation of instructors for the farm-schools, the rural schools, and the vocational schools. New programs were devised for both areas and new theoretical and practical courses were added, especially in the agricultural-teaching section. The school's library was also reorganized, and a special section of Haitian literature by Haitians and of books about Haiti was created for the very first time. Not only was this the first time Haitians had an institution like the improved Central School, but it was also the first time they had a national library of such breadth. At this time, there were three types of rural schools: the 74 farm-schools (under the Department of Agriculture), roughly 365 national rural schools (administered by the Department of Public Instruction), and 160 religious schools (nominally under the Department of Public Instruction, with 130 subsidized by the State) that had been set up in certain parishes per the Convention of 1913 between the Government and the Catholic bishops. The national rural schools were moved to the Division of Rural Education, which also oversaw the farm-schools. Finally, all of rural education could be found under one roof. The farm-schools had been the first serious and successful attempt to devise a kind of rural school to meet the needs of the people of the rural communities. They emphasized not only literacy but social services and the study of adequate methods of agriculture and handicrafts. The schools were now enlarged and ameliorated, and they functioned far better than they had before. Each school ‚Äì consisting of a good building of one, two, or three classrooms ‚Äì had a garden plot and a shop room equipped with the necessary tools and implements. Teaching methods were improved, and incompetent instructors were gradually dismissed, replaced only by those who had studied at the Central School of Agriculture. Up until now, Haiti had never had a corps of indigenous teachers having a classical and professional preparation; presently, with the instructors of the farm-schools, it did. The American Occupation had, in 1928, set up a small but important post-primary boarding school at Chatard in the north where outstanding pupils from the other farm-schools who had completed or were about to complete elementary schoolwork were sent. They remained at Chatard for three to four years and received advanced academic training as well as agricultural and manual training. Some of the boys did so well that, at the end of their studies at Chatard, they were able to go through the teacher-training division of the Central School of Agriculture. This was the very first attempt made to train rural leaders. In 1935, one hundred twenty-six primary schools in 63 bourgs (small market towns on a rural economy) were transferred to the Division of Rural Education. Then, in 1938, some 100 communal schools (maintained by a certain number of municipalities) and 10 schools (five for boys and five for girls) in the five agricultural colonies (on the border of the Dominican Republic) were also added to the Division. All of these underwent thorough reorganization, with the hiring of more qualified teachers (again through competitive exams), finding better housing for schools, and providing proper furnishings and school materials. In 1939, President St√©nio Vincent created a special school in Cap Ha√Øtien, the Children's Home of Vocational Education (a loose translation of La Maison Populaire de l'Education), a sort of primary technical school for less privileged boys, which was placed under the Division of Rural Education. That same year, a girls' school modeled on the one for boys at Chatard was finally realized: Martissant was created outside Port-au-Prince, a post-primary domestic science school for 100 girls, with all expenses paid by the government. It was the first of its kind and a real achievement. It too was run by the Division. Yet between 1935 and 1941, the annual government-allotted budget for rural education kept shrinking, which meant increasing creativity and careful management on the Division's part in utilizing available funds. Between 1942 and 1945, the 4C Associations (standing for coeur, cerveau, corps, et conscience ‚Äî that is, heart, mind, body, and conscience), begun a few years earlier and patterned after the American 4H Clubs, were taken over, reorganized, and developed into one of the most interesting features of the work in rural schools. They were gradually extended to a large number of schools, and by the end of 1944, there were more than 250 with 4C Associations. Their members were pupils who were enrolled in a given school and who adopted a yearly program of work consisting of a number of projects. Each group of projects was under the special care of a particular committee: agriculture, animal husbandry, health, manual arts, beekeeping, etc. It was felt that the habits and attitudes developed through these activities would be made more permanent if the initiative and the responsibility for the undertaking and carrying through of some of the projects were left to the pupils themselves under the guidance of the teachers. The agriculture committee, for example, was in charge of the upkeep of the grounds and gardens and supervised the agricultural projects launched in the community. The health committee took care of the cleanliness of the school premises and promoted extension work in the communities. Some rural-school teachers held night classes to teach literacy among adults, but they were faced with a language problem. The peasant knew only Creole, whereas books and printed materials had been in French. In 1940, an Irish Methodist preacher, the Reverend H. Ormonde McConnell, had initiated in the Port-au-Prince area two or three centers experimenting with teaching reading in Creole. In 1943, Dr. Frank C. Laubach, a former American missionary who had developed alphabets and phonetic methods for writing various dialects and languages, came to Haiti and helped the Rev. McConnell improve his phonetic method. After a few demonstrations, the Department of Public Instruction appropriated a sum of money to continue the experiment on a wider scale under the direction of a Literacy Committee which was headed by the Director of Primary Education (in the Department of Public Instruction) and of which the Rev. McConnell was made a member. Two booklets, teaching materials, and a small weekly newspaper were published in Creole. (Each issue of the paper reached 5000 copies.) Literacy centers were established in a number of localities throughout the Republic with the help of volunteers. At the end of 1944, reports indicated that 4242 adults had attended the various centers and that 1946 had been taught to read. Urban Education Unlike rural education and vocational education, which had been under the Technical Service and the Department of Agriculture during the American Occupation, urban education had been administered by the Department of Public Instruction and had not seen any reform during the 1920s. The urban primary schools were in two sections: elementary primary education, lasting six years, and higher (or superior) primary education, lasting an additional two to four years. Secondary education consisted of eight national lyc√©es (high schools), three private religious academies, and six lay secondary schools, all for boys, as there was still no secondary school for girls. The curriculum ran for seven years. The Minister of Public Instruction's report to then-president St√©nio Vincent for the year 1932‚Äì1933 spoke of the stagnation of the urban schools, which was due principally to the absence of sufficient funding. Teachers' salaries were low, making it difficult to recruit new instructors, despite the burning need. Inspectors and deputy inspectors were unable to make the three annual tours of their districts as required by law. School buildings were unsatisfactory because of age, neglect or unsuitability for housing classrooms. Basic school furniture was in need of repair or replacement, and school supplies were often non-existent. Student attendance had not varied over the course of years, since the law governing compulsory education was not enforced. Moreover, students were turned away from some schools because there was no room for them or there weren't enough teachers. Promising plans for a normal (i.e., teacher-training) school for women instructors of primary education had not progressed very far, and the recently created normal school for male teachers, housed in the basement of the newly formed National Service for Vocational Education, had yet to be properly organized. Both the women's and men's facilities lacked a dormitory to lodge applicants from the provinces. The shortcomings experienced at the primary level naturally affected the quality of urban education all the way up the line: insufficient formation in the lower grades left students less prepared for what they would encounter in high school. But the secondary level came in for its own criticism from The Report of the United States Commission on Education in Haiti overseen by Robert Russa Moton, principal of Tuskegee Institute, and issued in 1931, for failing to provide for the needs of the country by focusing on the literary at the expense of science, the social sciences, sociology, government, and economics. The dozen urban vocational schools (nine for boys, three for girls) were also at a disadvantage because the men best qualified and trained in the field by the Americans unfortunately did not head the new National Service of Vocational Education, and the schools, with the exception of Elie Dubois, degenerated further, until they were reorganized once more, in 1943. However, around 1935, a modern trade school, well equipped with shops and a dormitory, was built in Port-au-Prince and placed under the direction of the Catholic Salesian Fathers (Sal√©siens de Don Bosco). Also in 1935, R√©sia Vincent, the president's sister, brought from Italy five Salesian Sisters of St. John Bosco/Daughters of Mary Help of Christians (Soeurs Sal√©siennes de Don Bosco/Filles de Marie-Auxiliatrice) to run a boarding school that she opened in the poverty-stricken area of La Saline, just outside Port-au-Prince. It accommodated 100 very poor orphaned girls who were to be trained to become maids, cooks, housekeepers or seamstresses by learning, in addition to the three Rs, cooking, cleaning, laundry, sewing, and other household tasks. Ms. Vincent hoped to give girls a proper preparation, provide them with a trousseau upon leaving, and have them placed in families that would treat them well (which was not always the case with domestic help). As such, it was the first of its kind. Ms. Vincent then created a leisure club known as Thorland, outside the capital, whose dues and other income would support the school, and asked Esther Dartigue to be its director. In 1938, a first attempt was made to reorganize the Department of Public Instruction. The system was split into two big divisions: Urban Education and Rural Education, while Vocational Education ceased to exist as a separate entity and was shifted from the Department of Labor to the Department of Public Instruction. Urban Education had three sections: Administrative, under a Director-General; Pedagogic, with an Assistant Director of Classical Education, an Assistant Director of Vocational Education, and an Assistant Director of Girls' Education; and an Inspector Service. A Central Bureau of physical education was also created, consisting of a Commissioner of Sports, two monitors and a doctor. A dormitory was added to the Normal School for Girls for students from beyond the capital city, allowing for more young women to attend the school and for more trained staff to return to the provinces. In a certain number of provincial schools, incompetent teachers were replaced by students and graduates of the Normal School. Although the new administrative and organizational set-up constituted a definite improvement over the old one, and the men in charge more experienced, nevertheless it did not meet the professional and administrative requirements of an institution qualified to be entrusted with varied and specialized functions. It lacked professional training and dynamic leadership at the top, as well as the trained personnel needed at the intermediate levels. By the end of 1939, the reorganization movement had lost its momentum, and subsequent to a change in the Cabinet, no further measures were taken. In May 1941, a new government, headed by President Elie Lescot, undertook a thorough reorganization of urban education under Maurice Dartigue, the newly appointed Minister of Public Instruction, Agriculture and Labor. The changes made would become known among subsequent and present-day educators as la r√©forme Dartigue (the Dartigue reforms ‚Äì see, for example, Charles Pierre-Jacques' From Haiti to Africa, Itinerary of Maurice Dartigue, a Visionary Educator, published in 2017). As in the earlier case of rural education, there would be many firsts in the urban field, and they would be preceded by a complete, objective and scientific survey of the Department, from the central office to the most remote school. The initial survey was of the primary schools, followed by one of the vocational schools and, lastly, one of the secondary schools. A full inventory of conditions in each school was made, and a questionnaire was filled out by as many teachers as could be found. From a knowledge of existing conditions, based on fact and statistical data, a reorganization and modernization of the urban school system could proceed. The reorganization took place in three phases over the course of three years, inaugurating (a) a new administrative organization, (b) the training of personnel, and (c) the reorganization of the curriculum, improvement in methods of teaching, the editing of textbooks, organization of social welfare, and training in citizenship. Administration and supervision were centered in the Division of Urban Education (Direction g√©n√©rale de l'enseignement urbain), which was reorganized and installed under a Director- General with the following specialized divisions: Primary and Normal Education, Vocational Education, Secondary and Higher Education, Physical Education, and the Central Administrative Division. This last was constituted as follows: a personnel section which housed records on all teachers and kept a check on appointments, transfers, promotions, and pension requests; a statistics section; an inventory and supply section; and an accounting and control (of all purchases) section. An engineer was placed in charge of the upkeep of school buildings. From 1942 to 1945, an annual report was regularly published, covering all phases of the work of the Department of Public Instruction, with statistics and a summary of expenditures properly classified. Primary-school teachers who did not have the equivalent of nine years of primary education and had not obtained a passing grade in the examination given to them were dismissed. Candidates for teaching posts without a diploma from a normal school or a teacher-training course or without a certificate of completion of their secondary education were employed only if they passed a competitive examination. Short regional courses on the principles of education, methods and administration were inaugurated for all primary-school teachers in service. Summer courses for improving skills were introduced, held for one month at Damien (near Port-au-Prince), and were continued the next three years. In 1942, as a pilot project, Creole began to be used in the first two years of urban primary schools, thus allowing teachers to better initiate into school life children lacking French before introducing French as the language of their education. The vocational schools, which numbered 10 in 1942 (of which two were for girls) posed greater problems for their reform because these teachers needed to have an expertise in their field right from the start and could have only a certain number of students in class to make teaching effective. Vocational education also required materials that were expensive. A decision was made to close during a period of about 15 months those schools located in the provinces, while five principals and 10 teachers were sent to study in the United States and another group of instructors attended the vocational school of the Salesian Fathers in Port-au- Prince for a period of about seven months, where they received an intensive training. Those teachers who were truly incompetent were let go. It was also important to determine the needs of every community so that vocational schools could provide the appropriate courses to their students. The trades taught were cabinet-making, automobile mechanics, masonry, tinsmithing, tailoring, and shoemaking in the boys' schools; cooking, sewing, dressmaking, embroidery, and other needlework in the girls' schools. Not all the schools taught all the trades. On the heels of the survey of vocational schools, it was realized that the value of the graduates of the four private commercial schools, consisting of 400 students and located in Port-au-Prince, where bookkeeping, shorthand, and typing were taught, did not fully answer the need for competent personnel for businesses. A close collaboration was now established between the Department of Public Instruction and the schools' directors that would allow the Division of Urban Education to organize and direct the schools' final exams. In some of the larger cities, there were also part-time schools (√©coles de demi-temps) established specially for young servants, allowing them to go to public school when they were not working (assuming households would permit their attendance). As to the secondary schools, they too were in a woeful state. The comprehensive survey carried out by the Department had several aims. One was to professionalize education by hiring competent personnel through competitive exams or proper credentials. The other goal was to become aware in a detailed way of the functioning of the lyc√©es; the method of recruiting staff and the efficiency of this staff; the state of the school premises, the furniture and materials; and generally how the schools were being run. It also became evident that there was a need to create a meaningful program of study and to modernize teaching methods. Those instructors who did not have a certificate of completion of their secondary-school studies (representing about 10% of the teaching staff) were dismissed, and a prospective teacher who lacked training above the secondary-school level in the subject he was to teach could be employed only after passing a competitive exam. Furthermore, during three consecutive years, all the teachers of the nine public lyc√©es of the Republic had to attend summer courses in Port-au- Prince. (Teachers of private secondary schools were invited to attend as well, and some accepted.) These courses, which were an all-important innovation, were taught by visiting professors from American, Canadian and French universities, as well as by Haitian academics. (Among the scholarly figures Maurice Dartigue attracted to Haiti to lecture or to teach specialized courses to Haitian instructors were the eminent W.E.B. Du Bois, civil rights activist and co-founder of the NAACP; Aim√© C√©saire, co-founder of the N√©gritude movement in Francophone literature and French National Assembly D√©put√© representing his native Martinique; Alain Locke, \\"Dean\\" of the Harlem Renaissance and philosophy department chair at Howard University; and Auguste Viatte, literature department chair at Laval University in Montreal and champion of the French language throughout the world. Dartigue was also one of the lecturers at the summer courses.) The Americans were sent by the Division of Cultural Relations of the U.S. State Department and the U.S. Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. These departments also provided for a period of about three years a group of American teachers to teach English in the different lyc√©es and to train a group of Haitian teachers of English. The supervisor of this group, former Howard University professor Dr. Mercer Cook, did an outstanding job. DeWitt Peters, another of the American teachers, opened, with the Department of Public Instruction's financial support, the Art Center (Centre d'Art) in Port-au-Prince, which had considerable success and launched Haitian art onto the world market. Dorothy M. Kirby, yet another of these Americans, became the principal of the first public lyc√©e for girls since the time of President Alexandre P√©tion's secondary school for girls that had closed shortly after his death, in 1818. The opening of this new school in the fall of 1943 was a momentous event. Forty girls were admitted to the lyc√©e which had the same curriculum as the boys' school, but with domestic science and child care added. Since then, hundreds of young women have become professionals, especially in the fields of medicine, education, law, architecture and engineering. The Normal School for Girls was closed for five months, reorganized and re-opened in a new environment. In this project, the Department received the cooperation of the U.S. Inter-American Educational Foundation (part of the U.S. Institute of Inter-American Affairs). A teacher- training section for male teachers of urban schools was added to the Rural Normal School at Damien. In addition to these reforms, Dartigue sought to address the matter of personnel. Laws were passed and regulations instituted establishing the qualifications for the different levels of instruction and the positions of the professional staff. Moreover, political patronage was banned, a decision of capital importance that applied to all branches of the Department, not just to teachers, and where promotion would be based on merit and seniority. This was a radical departure from prior administrations where the field of education had been viewed as fertile ground for politicians to exercise their muscle in getting jobs for friends and family, regardless of qualification. This was because government jobs were practically the only secure means of livelihood for a large part of the educated class, since industry was essentially non-existent, since almost all the agricultural production was in the hands of an illiterate peasantry, and since a large part of commerce was controlled by foreigners. The successful reorganization of urban education was dependent on the development of a professional and administrative staff that was independent of politics. And for four-and-a-half years, there was no deviation from these rules. For the first time since Independence, a Haitian government would have in a serious manner laid down the bases for the professionalization of urban education. This was a brand-new conception in the field, the most remarkable and important contribution the Government made to the Department, allowing for permanent cadres of education and administrative specialists capable of assuring not only the application of reforms but also their continuation into the future, for one of the leading causes of the inefficiency of the Department, aside from politics, had been the absence of a body of competent specialists capable of directing and controlling the diverse branches of education. Specialists in the science of education and in educational administration are necessary to resolve the different problems that arise at every level of schooling. But where to find the first of these all-important specialists for the central office and for field supervision? The problem was solved using a few already experienced and professionally trained men from the Division of Rural Education and from the former National Service of Vocational Education, and then training others. Moreover, a number of men and women were selected from the Department of Public Instruction and sent abroad on grants for a period of training, varying from one to two years. In the first year alone (between June 1941 and October 1942), more than 80 students were dispatched to the United States, Puerto Rico, Canada and France, and the numbers only continued (more than 200) over the next three years. The majority went to the United States, to study education, especially the following branches: primary, secondary, vocational, physical education, administration, statistics, the teaching of English, and the teaching of music. The aim was to increase their competence and professionalism. About 95% of those receiving grants were chosen among teachers, supervisors, directors, principals, administrators and statisticians already in service, and some 15% attended Columbia University, which played an important role in educating Haitian students, helped and mentored by Mabel Carney, head of the rural education department. During this same period, about 150 other students traveled abroad, mostly to the U.S., to study in various other fields, including law, sanitary engineering, public health, military sciences, architecture, civil engineering, economics, agriculture, veterinary sciences, labor inspection, anthropology, social insurance, and various trades. According to the facts revealed in the comprehensive survey, nearly 50% of school locations were in horrible condition, and the best rooms in these schools were often used not as classrooms but as residences for the school directors and teachers. Almost all the State school buildings were rehabilitated. Schools housed in rented buildings were moved to better quarters. Small schools in one town or in a section of a town were consolidated into larger and more efficient units, and there were some new buildings as well. The Standard Fruit and Steamship Co. generously undertook to erect a building to house the Lyc√©e Saint-Marc, and O.J. Brandt, a British industrialist of Jamaican origin living in Port-au-Prince, also generously donated $10,000 for a laboratory building, inaugurated in 1945, at the Lyc√©e P√©tion; this was the first private-sector donation to the public sector. About four acres of land were purchased in the middle of the capital city for a new girls' lyc√©e, and by the end of 1945, approximately $14,000 had been saved up to be put toward the construction cost. The survey also indicated that special attention needed to be given to the appalling condition of school furniture. Consequently, old furniture was repaired, and new furniture such as desks and benches was added to all the schools. Almost all the blackboards had to be blackened. School materials (e.g., pencils, books, chalk, paper and blackboard erasers), which had often been non-existent, were now provided. New or repaired machines and tools were supplied to the vocational schools, which prior to this administration had had practically none. A new curriculum and new methods of teaching were introduced. Students were encouraged to engage in reflection and real understanding of subjects taught, rather than in \\"brain cramming.\\" Furthermore, they needed to embrace as quickly as possible the techniques and methods used in the technological civilization of the era. As a result, the teaching of natural sciences was improved and reinforced in the secondary schools, as was the teaching of social sciences and modern languages (English and Spanish). In fact, the reorganized study of English, which was made mandatory, was considered one of the Department's most important achievements. A course in Haitian literature was added. Programs in folklore, music and the arts were inaugurated, helping to develop and promote Haitian culture that would blend together the country's roots with elements of its French heritage and borrowings from its neighbors north and south, with which cultural exchanges were inaugurated, as well as a study of their geography. Calisthenics (which had been extra-curricular prior to October 1941) were now compulsory. Circulars were sent to teachers in all the urban schools showing them how they and their students were to do these exercises. Team sports and recreational games were made part of the school program. Civics was introduced into the curriculum of all primary, vocational and secondary schools to instill pride in being Haitian. For the first time since Independence, the nation's flag appeared outside each school, and the students sang the national anthem every morning. Arbor Day was also celebrated every May. A doctor was assigned to each school to inspect infirmaries and provide examinations of teachers and students. Libraries in the country's leading cities and towns were improved. This included placing the National Library (Biblioth√®que nationale) in Port-au-Prince under the control of the Division of Urban Education and installing a new director. Moreover, a special section devoted to Haitian literature by Haitians was inaugurated. All these many changes allowed for order and discipline in the administration and functioning of the education system. The establishment of a University of Haiti had been voted upon by the legislature as far back as 1920, but no plan had been put into motion. More than 20 years later, steps were finally taken towards its organization. The Law School became the Faculty of Law, and it was given a new director. The laws and rules of admission of students, exams, etc., were strictly observed. The library was organized on a serious basis, both in furnishings and in books and publications. A new Faculty of Sciences was formed, to which were annexed the School of Engineering and the School of Surveying. A new law was then passed inaugurating the University of Haiti, with Dartigue named as Acting Rector (in addition to all his ministerial responsibilities), and stating the general rules for its organization. The Faculty of Medicine and the School of Agriculture, which were not under the direct administration of the Department of Public Instruction, were \\"affiliated\\" with the University, and the Dean and Director of these respective institutions became members of the University Council of Deans (Conseil des Doyens). A cultural agreement was signed with the French Government providing for a French Institute (Institut fran√ßais en Ha√Øti) in Port-au-Prince, which would place a number of French professors at the disposal of the university without cost to the Haitian Government. (This followed the establishment in 1942 of the Haitian-American Institute to promote better relations between the two countries, a program of educational cooperation that would furnish American specialists to teach in Haiti and to improve the Haitian educational system. Furthermore, it provided grants for Haitians to study in the U.S. and Puerto Rico.) Plans were made to include in the university a teacher-training program for prospective secondary-school teachers. At the time of the enactment of this law, a site close to the Faculties of Law and Medicine was acquired at a cost of $9000, and an architectural contest was held to design a University Center with an administration building, library, auditorium, and small dormitory with a cafeteria. After the prizes had been given out for the contest, there was, in December 1945, about $15,000 on deposit for the project, more than necessary to cover the cost of the Administration Building. (Subsequent to Dartigue's exit from the government, the money was never spent for its intended purpose.) =Duvalier Era= Between 1960 and 1971, 158 new public schools were built. Private education represented 20% of school enrollment in 1959‚Äì60. After his son Jean-Claude \\"Baby Doc\\" Duvalier took over in 1971, the public sector continued to stagnate, but the private sector accelerated partly due to a rule instituted by Baby Doc that religious missionaries were required to build an affiliated school with any new church.Demombynes, Gabriel, Peter Holland, Gianmarco Le√≥n. 2010. Students and the Market for Schools in Haiti. The World Bank. Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Retrieved 19 November 2012. By 1979‚Äì80 57% of enrollment in primary education, and 80% in secondary education was private. During the Duvalier era a number of qualified teachers left the country to escape political repression. During the 1980s, the average annual growth rates in private and public enrollment were 11% and 5%, respectively. =Post Duvalier Era= The expansion of private schools increased further after the end of the Duvalier regime in 1986, as many religious communities established their own educational institutions. The years 1994‚Äì1999 were a peak period for school construction and the private sector has been growing exponentially since.

The dropout rate is particularly high at 29% in the first basic cycle. Close to 60% of children drop out of school before receiving their primary education certificate. Of the two million children enrolled in the basic level, 56% are at the required age for the first cycle (ages 6 to 11). While the mandated age for entering grade 1 is 6, the actual mean age is nearly 10, and students in grade 6 are on average almost 16, which is 5 years older than expected. 83% of those ages 6‚Äì14 attended school in 2005. These rates are much lower for the poor. With the exception of higher education, private schools in Haiti account for 80% of total enrollments and serve the majority of Haitian students.Wolff, L. 2008. Education in Haiti: The Way Forward. Washington, DC: PREAL. Retrieved 20 November 2012. According to Wolff there are three main types of schools that make up the private sector. The first and largest type of private schools are for-profit private schools run by entrepreneurs. These schools have very few, if any, books and unqualified teachers and school directors. They are popularly known as \\"√©coles borlettes,\\" which translates to \\"lottery schools,\\" because \\"only by chance do the children learn anything.\\" The second type of private schools are those run by religious organizations such as Catholic and Evangelical churches, as well as some nonsectarian schools. The Ministry of National Education at the time of the 2010 earthquake reported that Christian missionaries provide about 2,000 primary schools educating 600,000 students ‚Äì about a third of the population that is school age. Some of these schools offer a better quality of education than for-profit schools do, but they often have risky conditions and staff with no professional capabilities. The final type of private school composes of \\"community schools,\\" which are financed by whatever funds the local community can mobilize. They tend to be of very poor quality, worse than for-profit schools, but they do charge very low fees. A handful of private schools in Haiti, mostly clustered around the capital city, Port-au-Prince, and accessible to the rich (except for limited scholarship fund opportunities), offer education with relatively high quality standards. Furthermore, three-fourths of all private schools operate with no certification or license from the Ministry of National Education. This literally means that anyone can open a school at any level of education, recruit students and hire teachers without having to meet any minimum standards. The majority of schools in Haiti do not have adequate facilities and are under-equipped. According to the 2003 school survey, 5% of schools were housed in a church or an open-air shaded area. Some 58% do not have toilets and 23% have no running water. 36% of schools have libraries. The majority of workers, about 80% do not meet the existing criteria for the selection of training programs or are not accepted in these programs because of the lack of space in professional schools. 6 out of every 1,000 workers in the labor market have a diploma or certificate in a technical or professional field. In addition, 15% of teachers at the elementary level have basic teaching qualifications, including university degrees. Nearly 25% have not attended secondary school.[World Bank 2007 Project Appraisal Document for Education for All Program] More than half of the teachers lack adequate teacher training or have had no training at all. There is also a high attrition of teachers, as many teachers leave their profession for alternative better paying jobs. Sometimes they are not paid due to insufficient government funds.\\"Concern Training Teachers in Haiti\\", Education Partnership for children of conflict. Retrieved 5 March 2011. Current Issues = Structural violence = Anthropologist Paul Farmer states that an underlying problem, negatively affecting Haiti's education system, is structural violence. He says that Haiti illustrates how prevailing societal factors, such as racism, pollution, poor housing, poverty, and varying forms of social disparity, structural violence limits the children of Haiti, particularly those living in rural areas or coming from lower social classes, from enrolling into school and receiving proper education. Farmer has suggested that by addressing unfavorable social phenomena, such as poverty and social inequality, the negative impacts of structural violence on education can be reduced and that improvements to the nation's educational standards and literacy rates can be attained. = Educational Disincentives = Education in Haiti is valued. Literacy is a mark of some prestige. Students wear their school uniforms with pride. When Haitians are able to devote any income for schooling, it tends to take a higher proportion of their income compared to most other countries. There is a disjunction between the high opinion of education and educational attainment. Increasing a family's income would appear to solve the problem of insufficient family funds to pay for schooling.In reality, though, there are a confluence of systems and actors in Haiti's educational sphere that need to be taken into consideration. Locale needs to be considered ‚Äì depending on whether or not the community is urban or rural. There are the different actors ‚Äì students, families, schools, teachers, curriculum, the government, and NGOs. These are briefly some of the issues that affect the various actors: Students may delay their entry to school. They may be obliged to repeat grades. Sometimes they drop out. Teachers may be under-qualified. They may be underpaid. There may be insufficient schools in an area. They may lack adequate facilities. The expense of attendance may exceed a families resources. There are some families that spend 40% of their income on school expenses says Education Minister Nesmy Manigat. Curriculum mismatches may occur. For example, the language of instruction is typically in French. The vast majority of students speak only Creole. French instruction is useful in producing students who will be able to attend a university in a French- speaking country such as France or Canada. There is limited educational opportunities for students who do not want to attend university, or who want to attend but cannot afford it. The Government provides few public schools. They are vastly outnumbered by private schools. The government is unable to enforce its desired policies with respect to education. This inability has a myriad of ramifications. For example, the Haitian educational system has two exams that the government requires for a student to be promoted to the next grade. These exams are taken at the end of the 5th and 7th grades. However, many schools require exams at the end of every school year. The successful result will allow a promotion to the next grade- this includes public as well as private schools. The students are required to pay a fee to take the exams. If the fee is not paid, the student does not pass to the next grade regardless of how well they did during the school year. In rural areas, family income is greatest at the beginning of the school year when the harvest is in. It is easier to have children start school than finish. For families whose children do not get promoted, school fees must still be paid for the grade that is being repeated. This doubles the cost per grade or even more if the exam fees are once more not paid at the end of the year. This scenario is more likely for lower income families who can least afford the increased cost. A solution to this issue of less family funds at the end of the school year that Lunde proposes is a change in the banking system. She suggests that access to loans at the end of the year based on anticipated harvest of the next year may help in these instances. This is an example of digging deep through a system's issues and coming up with a possible solution that does not appear on the face of it to be connected to the problem. Another solution to one of the key problems and the main bottleneck ‚Äì teacher quality and quantity ‚Äì is using the Diaspora. The World Bank estimates that 8 out of 10 college educated Haitians live outside the country. A way to attract them back to Haiti would be to offer dual citizenship. A number of schools are run by religious organizations but many more are run as a business to make a profit. \\"The consequence of the privatization of education is that private households are carrying the economic burden of both the real cost of education and the private actor‚Äôs profit\\" Haiti has the highest percentage of private schools than any other country. Repeating grades leads to a wider range of abilities in the classroom, making it that much more difficult teaching. This taxes an already unqualified teacher's abilities. Often teachers are only a few grades ahead of the students they are teaching. Public school teachers typically are more qualified than private school teachers.There are no laws or regulations with respect to setting up a school so anyone can do it and begin teaching. There is a lack of schools in Haiti ‚Äì insufficient schools given the number of potential students. One of the results of this is that it can be a long walk to school in the countryside, in the dark ‚Äì a walk one way of 2 hours is not uncommon.Parents can be reluctant to send a 6-year-old that far on their own or even an older girl ‚Äì there are safety concerns.If the child does walk a long distance, they are often too tired to pay attention and may even fall asleep in class. The time getting to and from school also cuts into the time to help the family at home. If the parents are relying on the child's labor, this long walk can be a disincentive to enrollment. Delaying school enrollment leads to students starting school overaged which in turn has its own issues. Schools can be selective about who they admit. A number of them will only admit children who read and write already. This has made a big demand for pre- schools and creates one more hurdle to education for the lower income families. The best preschools cost more than the best private primary schools. Education Minister Nesmy Manigat has set a new policy that disallows preschool graduations - a practice that has been to raise revenue rather than academic standards. Families use different strategies to provide education despite the disincentives. Parents may focus their educational funds on the one child who appears to be the most promising academically. Or in the interests of fairness, allow one child to go to school, alternating children each year until all have had their chance and then repeat the cycle as funds allow. Since it may take at least 4 years to learn to read and write, dropping out before the first cycle is complete, typically makes an almost total loss of the money spent on that child's education. Given the lack of schools for the number of children who want education, there is a high demand for seats even if a family has the money to pay for school fees. At this point, it becomes a case of who they know ‚Äì personal connections become necessary. Having connections to a Marraine or Parraine (Godmother or Godfather) who can influence a school's decision to enroll your child is vital. There may actually be a number of influencers in chain ‚Äì that all must be paid a fee ‚Äì in order to secure a seat. = Impact of 2010 earthquake = Over 90% of students in Port-au-Prince had their schools destroyed in the earthquake. The 2010 Haiti earthquake that struck on 12 January 2010 has exacerbated the already constraining factors on Haiti's educational system. It is estimated that approximately 1.3 million children and youth under 18 were directly or indirectly affected. Nearly 4,200 schools were destroyed affecting nearly 50% of Haiti's total school and university population, and 90% of students in Port-au-Prince.Carlson et al. Haitian Diaspora and Education Reform. 2011. Columbia University.Retrieved 30 October 2012. Of this population, 700,000 were primary school-age children between the ages of 6 and 12 years old. The earthquake caused death and injury to thousands of students and hundreds of professors and school administrators, however the actual number of casualties is unknown. Most schools, including those that were minimally or not structurally affected at all, were closed for many months following the earthquake. More than a year since the earthquake occurred, many schools still remain closed and, in many cases, tents and other semi-permanent structures have become temporary replacements for damaged or closed schools.INEE. 2004.

Successful models While the Haitian state continues to rebuild the nation's infrastructure following the 2010 earthquake, private institutions are successfully educating Haitians by following a model of solidarity and subsidiarity. The Catholic Church remains the largest provider of education in Haiti, running 15% of schools nationally.Catholic Relief Services. June 2012. \\"Final Report of the National Survey of Catholic Schools in Haiti.\\" Retrieved 13 August 2014. The majority of the 2,315 Catholic schools are attached to a parish or congregation. An example of a successful model is Louverture Cleary School (LCS), a Catholic, tuition-free, co-educational secondary boarding school supported by The Haitian Project, Inc. In 2017, the school achieved a 100% pass rate on Haiti's baccalaur√©at exam, adding to its historic pass rate of 98%. The school takes a holistic approach to educating talented student's from the poorest neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince and runs an Office for External Affairs to provide job training and support for its graduates. Additionally, the office runs one of Haiti's largest university scholarship programs, providing university support to well over 100 LCS graduates in any given year. As a result, over 90% of LCS alumni are either working or attending university in Haiti. They are sought after employees who earn an average of 15x the per- capita income of Haiti. Another success is the Haitian Education and Leadership Program (H.E.L.P. ) This is a scholarship program which enrolls 100 students per year in Haitian universities and has had significant success in guiding students through university and avoiding brain drain. The university graduate rate for Haiti is 40% but for H.E.L.P. it is 84%. The employment rate is 50% for Haiti but 98% for H.E.L.P. And though only 16% of Haitian university graduates remain in Haiti after graduation, 90% of H.E.L.P graduates remain in Haiti. Educational system Formal education in Haiti begins at preschool, which is followed by 9 years of Fundamental Education (first, second and third cycles). Secondary education comprises 4 years of schooling. Starting at the second cycle of Fundamental Education, students have the option of following vocational training programs. According to the Ministry of National Education and Vocational Training (MENFP) education statistics of 2013-2014, there were 3,843,433 students from preschool through the last grade of secondary school (which is called Philo). Higher education follows completion of secondary education, and can be a wide range of years depending on program of study.

Although not compulsory, preschool is formally recognized for children between the ages of 3 and 5. Around 705,000 children below 6 years of age, representing 23% of the age group, have access to preschool education. The majority of preschools are in elementary schools, and most of these are private and concentrated in the West department. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade for preschools, going from 1628 gourdes (roughly $41) in 2004, to 4675 gourdes (roughly $117) in 2007, a 187% increase in just 3 years. Elementary education is compulsory for children between 6 and 11. It consists of 3 cycles of 3 years each, which altogether is called \\"fundamental education\\". The 3rd cycle is completed either in elementary or in secondary school. Enrollment has seen a steady improvement in the last decade. According to IHSI, the Haitian Institute of Statistics and Information Technology, school enrollment has gone from 40.1% in 1990 to 86.7% in 2002, representing 2.1 million children. Although tuition in public schools is legally free for the first two cycles of fundamental education, equivalent to elementary education, 81.5% of these children go to private schools and pay fees, often due to the limited availability of public schools. One hundred forty five districts have no public school and 92% of the 15,268 elementary schools in Haiti are private. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade. Average tuition for 2nd cycle classes in elementary school has almost tripled since 2000, sometimes going up to 92,500 gourdes ($2313). =Secondary education= Less than 22% of children move on from elementary to secondairesecondary education. Of this 22%, 75% go to private schools who charge fees. Of the approximately 2,190 secondary schools in Haiti, 90.5% of secondary schools are private and 78% of them are in urban areas. Roughly half of all schools are in the West Department. There is a large discrepancy between the West and other regions in Haiti. Tuition costs have increased significantly over the last decade. Average tuition went from 5,000 gourdes ($125) in 2004 to 7,800 gourdes ($195) in 2007, representing an increase of 56% in 3 years. =Higher education= Given the lack of access to education generally and the cost of attending university, less than 1% of Haiti's young people will go on to receive a university degree in Haiti. Students fortunate enough to pass Haiti's baccalaur√©at exam often require scholarships or other types of financial support to attend university. One of the largest university scholarship programs in Haiti is run by Louverture Cleary School, a Catholic, tuition-free, co-educational secondary boarding school supported by The Haitian Project, Inc. The school's Office for External Affairs provides scholarships to half of each graduating class, supporting well over 100 alumni on scholarships in any given year. Higher education in Haiti consists of 4 regional public universities including the State University of Haiti (Universit√© d'√âtat d'Haiti, UEH), 4 other public institutions each associated with their respective ministries, and the private sector. Public universities require an annual fee of 3,000 gourdes ($46.80). The State University of Haiti, in Port-au-Prince, is the largest public university in Haiti and had 10,130 students enrolled in 2008, with 2,340 of them being first year students. Estimates on the number of students enrolled in higher education vary greatly from 100,000 to 180,000, leading to about 40% to 80% of students in the private sector. Many private universities and institutions have emerged in the last 30 years and in total there are around 200, 80% of which are in Port-au-Prince. 54 out of these 200 schools are officially approved by MENFP. A list of some universities in Haiti includes: *Universit√© Cara√Øbe (CUC) *Universit√© d'√âtat d'Ha√Øti (UEH) *Universit√© Notre Dame d'Ha√Øti (UNDH) *Universit√© Adventiste d'Ha√Øti (Haitian Adventist University) * Centre de Techniques et d'Economie Appliqu√©e (CTPEA)INURED. 2010.

Starting at the second cycle of fundamental education, students have the option of following vocational training instead of pursuing the formal education cycles. It is given through different formats and at different levels and it includes: technical education (EET) and professional education (EEP), housework skills (CM) and professional training (CFP). GTEF estimates the number of students to be in vocational training to be about 21,090. *Professional education (EEP): Professional education in Haiti is given to children having completed elementary education. Most programs last for 3 to 4 years, and are aimed at teaching the basic skills of a given vocation. According to INFP, there are about 40 of them, of which almost half are private. *Technical education (EET): Around 50 out of the 138 institutions recognized by the INFP offer technical education at the secondary level, of which 4 are public. The programs usually last 3 years. *Family centers (\\"Centres Menagers\\"): Family centers offer 2 to 3-year programs in clothing, cooking and/or housework arts, to people who have not completed elementary education. There is no age restriction and most participants are female adults of all ages. There are about 140 such institutions in Haiti. Many of them are in elementary schools or in temporary locations, and operate in very bad conditions with almost no equipment. *Professional training (Centre de Formation Professionnelle, CFP): Professional training is meant for candidates having completed 10 or 11 years of education, or for workers wishing to acquire skills that are specific to a certain vocation of their choice. According to the Ministry of Social Affairs (MAST), there are over 200 private institutions, which cover 24 occupations and operate under their supervision. MAST delivers Professional Certificates to those who complete professional training. The West department consists of 80% of these institutions. The two public centers that existed are now not functional. The Centre Educatif de Carrefour has been closed since 2000 and the Centre Educatif de Bel Air was destroyed in the 2010 earthquake. Governance Summary of Government Function and Management Roles in Education Sector Education in Haiti is governed by the Haitian Ministry of National Education and Professional Training (Minist√®re de l'Education Nationale et de la Formation Professionnelle, or MENFP). Even though most of the schools in Haiti are private, the MENFP is charged with regulating the entire educational system. The Ministry of National Education has two main goals: (1) to provide educational services to its citizens and (2) to play a normative and regulatory role. However, the MNEFP has been ineffective in fulfilling these goals because it is overstretched and lacks enough support. For example, there is now approximately one inspector per six thousand students who is responsible for providing accreditation, pedagogical supervision, and administrative support. The MENFP plays a significant role in the determination of curriculum content, regulations, validation of degrees and certificates, and inspections. Organizationally, the ministry does not adequately separate the functions of governance and policy making from the functions of management. There is no strong and independent policy making body. In an effort to decentralize the education sector, a limited amount of responsibility and authority has been given to departments of Haiti (Haiti's ten geographic regions), school district offices, and inspection zones. Funding The Haitian government, mainly the Ministry of National Education is not in a position to close deficient schools because it is not equipped to take on the additional responsibility, nor does it have the resources or capacity to do so. After a peak of 19% in 1987‚Äì88 and 22% in 1994‚Äì95, the percentage of Haiti's national budget allocated to education declined from 17% to 10% between 2001 and 2010 with 20% of education-related expenditures reaching rural areas, which is where 70% of Haiti's population is found. This figure is low compared with other countries that are comparable according to the Human Development Index (HDI), which puts Haiti in 145th place out of 169 countries. However, Haiti receives international aid which supplements, to a certain extent, the insufficient educational budget. In 2006 the country received $10.4 million to support basic education programs and $2.5 million to support higher education programs. According to USAID, ongoing US-supported education programs have lowered dropout rates and raised the performance of more than 75,000 Haitian youth.Seelke, Clare Ribando. 2007. Overview of Education Issues and Programs in Latin America. Congressional Research Report for Congress. Retrieved 24 November 2012. The substantial growth of the private sector, despite the constitutional guarantee of free education, indicates that the reality is that providing free education for all is very expensive. The majority of private schools do not receive any government subsidizes. There is no government scholarship program to alleviate the burden on poor families. Help comes from the \\"Fonds de Parrainage\\", a private sector foundation which offers scholarships to needy children enrolled in eligible private schools. The annual number of beneficiaries is around 13,000, representing a mere 1.3% of the student population enrolled in private schools. Financial support from the government is a salary subsidy covering approximately 500 teachers working full-time in private religious schools. This represents 2.5% of the private sector teaching force. The public schools have collected fees because government funding has been insufficient. It had become common practice for school principals to require a parental financial contribution from each student. Thus, for many parents, it did not make as much financial difference to put their children in public or private schools. When President Aristide returned from exile, he decided that public schools would no longer collect fees. This decision actually had a negative effect because it left public schools more destitute. It is clear that the growth of the private sector has become a substitution for public investment, as opposed to an addition. Recent reform efforts Despite the severe deficiencies of the Haitian education sector, many Haitian leaders have attempted to make improving education an important national goal. The country has attempted three major education reform efforts in recent years including the Bernard Reform of 1978, The National Plan on Education and Training (NPET) of 1997, and The Presidential Commission for Education in Haiti of 2008. More recently, following the 2010 earthquake, Haiti has partnered with the Inter-American Development Bank to propose a new 5-year educational plan. =Bernard Reform of 1978= The Bernard Reform of 1978 was an attempt to modernize and make the educational system more efficient. It was also an attempt at capacity building to satisfy the educational needs of the country despite its economic limitations. The Bernard Reform sought to introduce vocational training programs designed as alternatives to traditional education in order to align the school structure with labor market demands. The reform also restructured and expanded the secondary school system by separating it into academic and technical tracks. In addition, Haitian Creole began to be utilized in classrooms as the language of instruction in the first 4 grades of primary school during this time period. French and Creole are both official languages of Haiti. All Haitians speak Creole. The most privileged Haitians speak French. The practice of using French rather than Creole in the classroom discriminates against the lower socioeconomic classes and the Bernard Reform was an attempt at addressing this issue. As part of the reform, a program was implemented in 1979 with the help of the World Bank to make Creole the first language of instruction rather than French. One thousand students were chosen to participate. During the first four years of school, all subjects were taught in Creole. In the third and fourth year, students were taught how to read and write in French. In the fifth year all teaching was done in French. The program was canceled in 1982 even though it was a great success. The elite had put pressure on the government to eliminate the program; they were concerned that the better educated citizens would be a threat to their power. In addition to failing to make Creole the initial language of instruction there were two other serious failures: lengthy delays in the implementation of new the curriculum and inadequate resources and infrastructure to support the proposed changes. An issue that also became prevalent was that the majority of parents preferred to see their children attend universities because they saw the technical schools as low-prestige institutions. As a result, the labor market lacked sufficient jobs for new graduates of liberal arts programs, and consequently salaries lagged behind expectations. =The National Plan on Education and Training of 1997= The National Plan on Education and Training was a plan that introduced a shift away from the French educational model. The French educational model was one characterized by a highly centralized bureaucracy, which was teacher-centered and saw students as passive learners. The NPET of 1997 marked a shift to a model of participatory learning based on student-centered approaches. The NPET also shifted to a new paradigm of citizenship education aimed at developing civic knowledge and attitudes that would promote unity and an appreciation of the diversity in Haitian society, providing the foundation for an inclusive national identity. One of the principal goals of this plan was to uphold the Constitution and ensure that primary education would be made compulsory and free, neither of which have been realized to date. The national education budget increased from 9% of the national budget in 1997 to 22% in 2000. This paid for programs to provide school lunches, uniforms, and bus transportation. Additionally, in 2002 the government began a literacy campaign, facilitated by 30,000 literacy monitors and the distribution of 700,000 literacy manuals. Overall, school attendance rose from 20% in 1994 to 64% in 2000. The NPET, however, was limited in its achievements. The goal of making primary education free and compulsory has not been met. Primary education remains beyond the reach of most Haitians, because they are highly privatized and very expensive. In addition, there has been minimal decentralization of the educational sector because there are fears that the decentralization process will lead to fragmentation rather than resolve the problems of social polarization. Furthermore, the NPET has not been successful in creating a space for communities to express their opinions through parent-teacher associations or other mechanisms. =The Presidential Commission for Education in Haiti of 2008= The Presidential Commission for Education reported their recommendations to outgoing President Ren√© Pr√©val and the Ministry of National Education on recommendations for a new national curriculum. The primary goals of the commission were to provide 100% enrollment of all school-age children, a free education to all, including textbooks and materials, and a hot meal daily for each child. Lumarque stated that accelerated teacher training was essential for the attainment of these goals. In order to adequately reflect the needs of the people the commission traveled throughout the country asking parents and community leaders what they desired most for their children. When the national curriculum plan is finalized, all public schools and those private schools that choose to participate will be expected to begin utilizing standardized teaching materials in addition to standardized test methods.McNulty, B. 2011. The Education of Poverty: Rebuilding Haiti's School System After Its \\"Total Collapse\\". The Fletcher Forum of World Affairs, 35 (1), 111. =The Operational Plan of 2010‚Äì2015= After Haiti's 2010 earthquake, the President of Haiti, Ren√© Pr√©val in May 2010 gave the Inter-American Development Bank, IDB the mandate to work with the Education Ministry and the National Commission in preparing a major reform of the education system in a 5-year plan. This 5-year, US$4.2 billion plan calling for private schools to become publicly funded which would increase the access of education for all children. The plan hopes to have all children enrolled in free education up to 6th grade by 2015, and 9th grade by 2020. The IDB has committed 250 million USD of its own grant resources and has pledged to raise an additional 250million USD from third-party donors. The first phase of the plan is to subsidize existing private schools. According to the plan, the government would pay the salaries of teachers and administrators participating in the new system. In order to participate in this new system, schools will undergo a certification process to verify the number of students and staff at their school, after which they will receive funding to upgrade facilities and purchase educational materials. This would become the first step towards establishing a tracking mechanism in Haiti. In order to remain certified, schools would have to comply with certain standards, including the adoption of a national curriculum, teacher training and facility improvement programs. The plan will also finance the building of new schools and the use of school spaces to provide services such as nutrition and health care. Currently, most private schools serve approximately 100 students; yet they have the capacity for up to 400. The intention of the plan is to eliminate waste and become more efficient in the schooling system. The goal is to eliminate low quality, inefficient schools and consolidate many others over time, and improve the overall quality of education in Haitian schools.Inter-American Development Bank. 2010.

Downey were Victorian studio photographers operating in London from the 1860s to the 1910s. William Downey (14 July 1829 in South Shields ‚Äì 7 July 1915 in Kensington),photoLondon who came to be known as the Queen's Photographer, was born in King Street in South Shields, a decade before commercial photography had become a reality. William, initially, was a carpenter and boatbuilder,Downey but in about 1855 he set up a studio in South Shields with his brother Daniel and later established branches in Blyth, Morpeth and Newcastle. Their first Royal commission was to provide photographs for Queen Victoria of the Hartley Colliery Disaster in January 1862. Daniel Downey is his brother (1831 ‚Äì 15 July 1881). In 1863 they opened a studio on Eldon Square in Newcastle. The same year William set up a studio in the Houses of Parliament and produced portraits of every parliamentarian of the day. The resulting images' location is unknown to this day.ChronicleLive William moved to 57 & 61 Ebury Street in London in 1872 and opened another studio, his brother managing the Newcastle branch. The London studio enjoyed the patronage of Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales, taking photos at Balmoral and Frogmore during the 1860s. Its first Royal image was of the Princess of Wales at the York Agricultural Show in about 1865. The studio also produced the iconic carte-de-visite portrait of the Princess of Wales piggybacking Princess Louise. The studio received a Royal Warrant in 1879. Downey used Joseph Swan's carbon process for their best work. In the 1880s Mawson, Swan & Morgan of Newcastle, was the world's largest manufacturer of photographic dry plates, the convenience of which made photography a commercial reality. George Eastman spent some time there during the eighties and afterwards invented the Box Brownie and roll film, ending the monopoly of studios on permanent images. William Downey's son, William Edward Downey (1855‚Äì1908), managed most of the royal sittings during the Edwardian era.National Portrait Gallery Gladys Cooper, a child photographic model of the time, reminisces about the Downeys in her autobiography:\\"Gladys Cooper\\", Hutchinson & Co Ltd, London, 1931 William senior was married to Lucy, who had been born in Speenhamland, Berkshire in 1843, and they had one son and one daughter. He joined the Photographic Society (later The Royal Photographic Society) in December 1870. The 1891 and 1901 census records show that he was living at 10 Nevern Square, Warwick Road, Earl's Court, Kensington. Downey's prized silver collection was stolen from his Earl's Court home in November 1914 ‚Äì the burglary is said to have brought on his death. William Downey senior was William Fowler Downey and he married Caroline Griffiths of Cheshire. They had two sons, William Edward and Robert Ingham (who died an infant). Caroline died in 1874 and William remarried Lucy Lyon in 1877. Their children were Arthur James Hope and Laura Evelyn. Arthur, as A.J.H. Downey, continued the family business: his work included a portrait of King George V's children in 1910, the year of their father's accession. Daniel Downey married Elizabeth Smith Beloe and had three children, another Robert Ingham Downey, Elizabeth and Victoria Christine. Daniel died in Bethnal House, Bethnal Green on 15 July 1881.

Before and after her Navy service she was ocean liner SS Matsonia for the Matson Navigation Company. The liner was sold in 1937 to the Alaska Packers Association and renamed SS Etolin. Shortly before World War II, the ship was chartered by the United States Army as USAT Etolin. Transferred to the War Shipping Administration in 1946, Etolin was placed in the James River Reserve Fleet and ultimately scrapped in 1957.  History  Matsonia, built by the Newport News Ship Building Company of Newport News, Virginia, in 1913, served the Matson Navigation Company until taken over by the U.S. Shipping Board and turned over to the Navy at New York by way of the Panama Canal, 22 January 1918, for use as a troop transport. She was commissioned 1 March 1918, Captain John M. Luby in command. Beginning 14 March, when she sailed for France with troops and Army cargo, Matsonia completed six round trips to Europe prior to the Armistice. The preparation to turn the Matsonia into a troop carrier involved ripping out mahogany staircases \\"as if they were worth nothing\\" and using every bit of space by rigging up 3,000 soldier bunks wherever they could be rigged. During her second France-bound trip during World War I the convoy was attacked by a German U-boat that was sunk about 800 meters from the Matsonia. During that time she transferred 13,329 passengers to Europe, and carried back only 10. After the Armistice she continued her transatlantic crossings to return over 23,000 troops in 8 voyages, ending such crossings at New York on 20 August 1919. She was decommissioned on 12 September 1919 and returned to her former owner on 17 September. On March 26, 1937 S.S. Matsonia sailed from San Francisco to Honolulu with Captain F.A. Johnson, USNR, Commanding. In 1937, Matsonia was sold to Alaskan interests and renamed Etolin. The U.S. Army chartered her for troopship service in August 1940 and kept her through World War II, retaining her second name. On 5 December 1941 Etolin with 1,400 troops embarked departed San Francisco in company with the then chartered Army transport Tasker H. Bliss bound for the Philippines. The ships were turned back to San Francisco after the attack on Pearl Harbor and disembarked the troops 8‚Äì9 December. She made prewar voyages to the Philippines on voyages that included Alaska and Hawaii and, in early 1942, steamed down to South America before returning to the Hawaiian transport route. Later in that year, Etolin went to Baltimore, Maryland, where she was extensively overhauled. After arriving back at San Francisco, California, in July 1943, she operated from the U.S. to Australia and Hawaii. After repairs that lasted from the last part of 1944 through first seven months of 1945, USAT Etolin twice crossed the Pacific to Japan and Okinawa. During early 1946, she served between New Orleans, Louisiana, and Panama, before being turned over to the War Shipping Administration in late April 1946 for layup in the James River (Virginia) Reserve Fleet. Etolin was scrapped at Baltimore, Maryland, in 1957.

His nephew, Michael Fresco, has carried on the family tradition as a Fleet Street sports photographer. Fresco was a member of the Sports Journalist Association and one of the SJA's most renowned members. His career spanned 50 years as a top sports photographer, including three decades at the Daily Mirror. The Sports Journalists' Association made the annual presentation of the Doug Gardner Award for services to sports journalism to him.3 Fresco was brought up in London's East End the son of a tailor. He was evacuated at an early age and poorly educated leaving school at 14 years of age. He joined Topical Press in the 1950s as a runner boy, then went on to become a dark room photographic printer in Red Lion Court, Fleet Street, while covering bigger sporting events evenings and weekends (obtaining entrance to venues was much easier in those days). On his 18th birthday Topical made him a \\"Junior Photographer\\". When Topical Press closed he moved onto International News Photos, part of the American Hearst Corporation covering all assignments. When INP merged with Planet News he was offered a photographer's position. Ted Taylor, boss of INP, had recommended him to the Daily Mirror, where they made him a salaried freelance photographer for almost a year. Taken on the staff of the Mirror in 1958, he went on to become chief sports photographer for 30 years. His work included the iconic image of Vinnie Jones getting to grips with Paul Gascoigne in midfield. He moved on in 1988 (during the Maxwell era) joining Bob Thomas Sports Photography as director/photographer, still covering major sporting events worldwide. Later this was merged with Popperfoto.com. He was invested with an MBE in October 1995 for 'Services to Sports Photography'. He retired in 2004. Photographs of note His famous photographs include: # Vinnie Jones tackling Paul Gascoigne off the ball. The photograph can be found on T-shirts and coffee cups and has been used in several advertising campaigns, most recently by BT. # Dave Mackay when he broke the same leg twice. He first broke the leg against Manchester United at Old Trafford in a European cup-tie and the second time at home to Shrewsbury Town reserves. The photograph is still a best seller to Spurs fans. # Dave Mackay grabbing Leeds United's Billy Bremner by his shirt at White Hart Lane in 1966 after he had been heavily tackled in his comeback match after breaking his leg a second time. It remains the most popular of all Tottenham action photographs. Monte is known on Fleet Street to this day for his sense of humour and for turning sports photography into a distinct discipline separate from news photography within the print media. He coined the terms \\"Smudger\\" (a photographer) and \\"Blunt Nib\\" (writer).2 References External links * Canon Europe * Sports Journalists * UK Sport * * Category:British photojournalists Category:Daily Mirror people Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire Category:1936 births Category:2013 deaths Category:Photographers from London ","title":"Monte Fresco"},{"id":"18091914","title":"Ban'ei Kinen"},{"id":"18091915","text":"Greetings & Readings of Hunt Valley was the largest independent bookstore in Baltimore and was a member of the American Booksellers Association.

He was involved at the start of the Central Intelligence Agency's Rendition, Detention and Interrogation program of \\"high- value detainees,\\" including Abu Zubaydah, Ramzi bin al-Shibh, Abd al-Rahim al- Nashiri, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. CIA career Martinez worked as an analyst in the CIA Counternarcotics Center. He tracked suspected drug traffickers through electronic communications and documents. After al-Qaeda's attacks on September 11, 2001, he was transferred to the Counterterrorism Center, where he used those same techniques to find members of al-Qaeda. In early 2002, he went to Pakistan to be part of the team that located and captured Abu Zubaydah. At a black site in Thailand, Abu Zubaydah was first interrogated by the FBI. Eventually, CIA employees and contractors took over and began the torture of Abu Zubaydah and the FBI agents left. At that point, \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" such as waterboarding were used on Abu Zubaydah. Martinez never employed these methods himself, rather he attempted traditional trust-building interrogations after the coercive methods stopped. He interrogated Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who cooperated without resorting to coercive interrogation methods. He also interrogated Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed after they had been tortured. Martinez eventually left the CIA and went to work for Mitchell Jessen and Associates, a consulting company run by former military psychologists Jim Mitchell and Bruce Jessen. Mitchell and Jessen created the \\"enhanced interrogation techniques\\" program and were present at the black site in Thailand with Martinez when they were used for the first time on Abu Zubaydah. Identity The first published information about Martinez came from a June 22, 2008 New York Times article written by Scott Shane. In an concurrent editors' note, the New York Times stated that they were asked, by the CIA and a lawyer representing Martinez, to obfuscate his identity for the article so that Martinez could protect his reputation. The newspaper considered this, but ultimately declined, although they did not use his given first name, but his nickname, \\"Deuce.\\" The editors stated that Martinez had never operated undercover and the story's credibility required using his real name. On January 23, 2012, the Department of Justice charged ex-CIA officer John Kiriakou with providing Martinez's name to the New York Times for the story. Scott Shane later wrote that he already knew Martinez' name before he contacted Kiriakou: > I asked [Kiriakou] about an interrogator whose name I had heard: Deuce > Martinez. He said that they had worked together to catch Abu Zubaydah, and > that he would be a great source on Mr. Mohammed, the architect of the Sept. > 11 attacks.

(Some sources (such as imdb.com) list James Dayton as the writer of the screenplay.) The film is today considered to be lost. Plot Rose, a beautiful mountain girl, is raised to womanhood by a cruel old hag in a hut on a mountainside. Jack Norton, a handsome Ranger, admires the girl, and his affection is slowly turning into love, but just then he is called away on a patrol. Silent Jordan, an old prospector and friend of Jack's, finds the girl's face very familiar, and then realizes that she is his old sweetheart's daughter. Paul Rouchelle, an artist visiting the mountains, sees the girl and gets her to pose for him. Rose falls in love with the well polished gentleman who promises a life of excitement and glamour, and she consents to marry him. He takes her back to his art studio in the big city, but she soon learns that he already has a wife and child, so she leaves him and goes back to the mountains. Paul follows her and plans to steal her back when Jack arrives. Paul tells Jack that Rose was his mistress and Paul attacks him in anger. Silent Jordan stops Jack from shooting Paul, and forces the artist to leave. (A still exists showing Silent Jordan preventing Jack from shooting Paul Rouchelle). Rose finds out that the old hag who raised her has died in Rose's absence, and she is now all alone in the world. Jack asks Rose if what Paul said was true; she nods sadly and confesses it is true, and Jack turns away. Silent Jordan takes the sad couple to a little grave on a hillside and tells them the story of how he loved a girl once many years before, but abandoned her on their wedding day when he discovered she already had a baby daughter. He returned years later to find that the girl he abandoned had died of a broken heart, and he has regretted leaving her ever since, becoming a hermit as a result. (That woman's baby was Rose, which explains why she was raised by the old hag who took the child in.) Jack, with tears in his eyes, embraces Rose, and they are married.

Overview  Universal access to primary and secondary education dates from at least the 1960s. The literacy rate in Barbados for youth and adults are both above 99%, only falling to 98.5 among the elderly. The literacy gender parity rate is 1.0. This information is for 2014. Starting in 2000, the government initiated the Education Sector Enhancement Programme, usually referred to as EduTech 2000. This USD 213 million project was financed by the Government of Barbados (45%), the Inter-American Development Bank (40% and the Caribbean Development Bank (15%). This initiative provided for four key improvements: (a) repairs to 73 of the public primary and secondary school buildings; (b) new units established by the Ministry to support new teaching methodologies, including the Shell Media Resources Review Center, the National Educational Evaluation and Research Centre (at the University of the West Indies, Cave Hill), and a Programme office within the Ministry; enhancements to the technological availability (new computers, software and networking); (d) in-service training for all teachers in technology integration, child-centred methodologies, and special needs education; and (e) curricular reform to respond to changes in Barbados society. The key conceptual foundations for the initiative are constructivism and child-centred education. Most of the in-service training was provided by Erdiston Teachers' Training College. Institutions As of 2015-16, there are: *10 public nursery schools, *14 private nursery schools, *68 public primary schools (of which 67 offer pre-primary education), *26 private primary/mixed schools, *3 public special needs schools (and 4 public primary schools with special needs services), *4 private special needs schools, *22 public secondary schools (of which nine offer sixth form), *9 private secondary/mixed schools ;5 tertiary- or vocational-level institutions * UWI Cave Hill *Barbados Community College (BCC) *The Samuel Jackman Prescod Institute of Technology (SJPI) *Codrington College *Erdiston Teachers' Training College ;1 central administrative agency, Ministry of Education, Technological and Vocational Training, including inter alia *Media Resources Department *Higher Education Development Unit *Education Project Implementation Unit School Year The Barbadian school year is fashioned after the British system, and as such, it follows a scheduling with three terms per school year. The first term begins the second week of September and continues for 15 weeks adjourning in mid-December excluding one week for Mid Term Break in Mid-October. The second Term begins in the first week of January and continues for 12 weeks ending the end of March. The final Third Term begins mid-April and continues for 11 weeks until the end of June. The School Holiday period is 9 to 10 weeks long from the end of June until the first week of September. Education is provided free of charge and is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16, and attendance is strictly enforced.\\"Barbados\\" . Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2001).

In 1991, the gross primary enrollment rate was 90.4 percent. It was reported that Barbados has spent roughly US$15 billion on Education since Independence in 1966. In 2006 during the inaugural Cecil F. deCaires Memorial Lecture at the Frank Collymore Hall, the former Central Bank Governor Sir Courtney Blackman remarked that between 1966 and 2000 successive Governments (of Barbados) had spent US$15 billion on education costs ‚Äì \\"a remarkable investment for such a small state\\". In 2009, Ronald Jones as the Minister of Education and Human Resource Development said the Barbados government spent $290 million to upgrade the schools with information technology.

It was founded on April 21, 1957 as Hutniczy Klub Sportowy (Steelworkers' Sports Club) and renamed Biela≈Ñski Klub Sportowy (Bielany Sports Club) in 2001. History Hutnik has never played in the top division, and the highest position it has achieved in the Polish First League was 6th (1992/93). The successes in the Polish Cup include reaching the quarterfinal in 1991, as well as winning the Cup on a regional level on June 4, 2008 (after defeating Legia Warszawa reserves 1:0 in the final). Despite not being the most successful of clubs in terms of trophy-winning, Hutnik has always been particularly active in developing young, mostly local, players; several former Hutnik players even went on to play for the Polish national team. Micha≈Ç ≈ªew≈Çakow, previous captain of the national team, is a former Hutnik player. Hutnik was traditionally sponsored by the nearby steel mill (Huta Warszawa) and the privatisation of that steelworks ‚Äì and thus the ending of the sponsorship ‚Äì marked the beginning of the club's steady decline.

The Guarani word Pira means \\"fish\\". History The soup is very high in calorie content and in protein. This has its origins in the circumstances after the Paraguayan War (1864 to 1870). The war made food scarce, so daily meals were limited and had to be calorie and nutrient dense. Margarita Miro Ibars, a scholar of Paraguayan culinary anthropology, says \\"‚Ä¶ all Guarani groups were major consumers of fish and prepared a fish meal. Fish was the basic food protein, along with game hens similar to those of Spain and abundant game animals‚Ä¶ \\" Ingredients Traditionally the fish used for pira caldo are mainly smaller river fish such as the mandi'y and tare'y, from the armored catfish family. Other ingredients include fat, onion, tomatoes, green or red bell peppers, parsley, pepper, spices, and salt. Preparation The pira caldo as most popularly prepared begins with frying the vegetables in a little beef or pork fat. Then boiled water and the fish are added with salt and spices. When the fish is cooked and the soup is thick, some chopped chili pepper is added. As pira caldo is a widespread dish, there are a number of variations. One of them which constitutes a rich source of protein is prepared by running the cooked fish through a small mill. This method of preparation avoids the problem of small children choking on the bones. References * Aquinas, Josefina Velilla. Tembi'u Paraguay. * Ibars, Margarita Miro.

They were among the biggest Italian witch trials, and caused the deaths of about 60 persons, in each trial: 110 in total. The best source for the trials is considered to be the Venetian Marin Sanudo, who was the chronicler to the Council of Ten from 1496 to 1536. The documentary evidence was destroyed by order of Giacinto Gaggia, the bishop of Brescia, to prevent it from being used by the anticlerical opposition.  Background  The region had not undergone full conversion to Christianity until the 5th century, and thus even by the 8th century, the area was still suspect for paganism. For example, after a ban on the practice promulgated in 724, Liutprand, King of the Lombards, feared the area would rebel. In the laws of 1498, stern laws are issued against all \\"Devilish heresy\\". In 1499, it was accused of having participated in a \\"Black mass\\", and it was reported to be common with such \\"depravity\\" in the area.  The first trial 1505‚Äì1510  In 1433, witches were burnt in South Tirol, 1460 in Valtellina, and in 1485, the Inquisitor Antonio da Brescia had strongly criticized the ongoing heresy and witchcraft in Val Camonica in the Venetian Senate. On 23 June 1505, seven women and one man were burned in Cemmo in Val Camonica, and in 1510, witches were burned who were accused of having caused the drought by magic: 60 women and men confessed having injured people, animals and land with their spells, caused fires with help of Satan: \\"The whole world mourns for the sad lack of faith in God and the saints in Valcamonica. In four places in Valcamonica, c. sixty four people men and women, have been executed, and many more are placed in prison...\\"  The second trial 1518‚Äì1521  The second trial occurred after the peace of Noyon with France. During the first months of 1518, inquisitors were stationed in the parishes of the Val Camonica; Don Bernardino de Grossis in Pisogne, Don James de Gablani in Rogno, Don Valerio de Boni in Breno, Don Donato de Savallo in Cemmo and Don Battista Capurione in Edolo, all under the bishop Inquisitor Peter Durante, who presided at the central court of the Inquisition at Cemmo. In July 1518, more than sixty women and men were burned at the stake. In a letter from August 1518, an official, Josef di Orzinuovi, reported of the trial to Ludovico Quercini. He reported that several people had been burned for witch craft after spreading the plague by magic. They were also accused of causing thunder and lightning storms. The same year, one Carlo Miani, a venetian nobleman, wrote to Dr Zorzi: \\"Some women in Breto have confessed to have spread powder from Satan through the air, which caused sickness and the death of 200 people...\\"  Aftermath  In 1573, it was reported that Christianity was still weak in the area; few fulfilled their religious responsibilities, women went to church without covering their hair with a veil, people danced on holidays. In 1580, the church again instigated a visit to make the inhabitants more Catholic. A lot of old Pagan cults and habits were still alive there. On The Tonale mountain, the \\"witches\\" were reputed to meet at July. This time, however, the visit of the church did not lead to executions.

It is thought to have been scripted by Ida May Park (De Grasse's wife). The film is now considered to be lost. Plot Sister Ursula is a nun in a convent in Southern Spain. One day, while the peddler Perez (Lon Chaney) comes to the convent to sell his wares, she sees Manuel, a handsome cavalier, riding by and she cannot suppress her attraction to him. Perez sells the Abbess a beautiful length of fabric for an altar cloth, but when Ursula is putting it away, she cannot resist the temptation to cover herself in the cloth and admire her own beauty. Coming to her senses, she runs to the Abbess to confess her sins. Her penance is to kneel in vigil before the altar all night long, but during the night she falls asleep. She dreams that Perez tempts her to leave the convent with him by saying he will bring her to Manuel. Ursula travels with Perez while disguised as a boy, and they come upon a group of thieves in the forest who attack and imprison Manuel when he rides near their camp. With the help of Perez, Ursula drugs the thieves on guard duty and the two help Manuel to escape. The trio comes upon a troupe of dancing girls, who think Ursula is really a young boy and tease her for being shy. Carmela, one of the dancers, attempts to win Manuel's favor, and when he ignores her advances, she attacks him with a knife. Ursula steps in her path and is stabbed in the arm. While tending to Ursula's wound, Manuel discovers she is actually a nun. The dancing girls plan a feast for Ursula, but Carmela denounces her as a fallen nun. They all attack her and brutally beat her for her sins. Suddenly Ursula wakes up on the altar with the Abbess beside her, and realizes it was all just a bad dream. She never really left the convent at all. Ursula and the Abbess pray together for her forgiveness. Cast * Pauline Bush as Sister Ursula * Lon Chaney as Perez, the peddler * William C.

It was based on the 1927 musical Hit the Deck, which was itself based on the 1922 play Shore Leave by Hubert Osborne. It was one of the most expensive productions of RKO Radio Pictures up to that time, and one of the most expensive productions of 1930. This version faithfully reproduced the stage version of the musical. Plot Looloo (Walker) runs a diner which is frequented with U.S. Navy sailors on shore leave, including officers. Two officers, Admiral Smith (Henderson) and Lieutenant Allen (MacDonald) accompany a wealthy socialite, Mrs. Payne (Clayton), to the establishment. Mrs. Payne is an heiress, and when she engages in conversation with Looloo, she expresses admiration for the necklace Looloo is wearing. She offers to purchase it for a substantial sum, but it is a family heirloom and Looloo refuses. Later, two sailors arrive at the diner, Bilge (Oakie) and Clarence (Ovey), looking for Lavinia, Clarence's sweetheart who has run away. Bilge, is smitten with Looloo, and begins to romance her. Opening up to her, he reveals his desire to become the captain of his own ship after he leaves the navy. Before things go too far, Bilge's shipmates drag him back to his ship, which is scheduled to set sail. Based on her conversation with Bilge, Looloo decides to sell her necklace to Mrs. Payne, in order to get the funds necessary to buy a ship for Bilge. When Bilge's ship docks once again, the two lovers are re-united, and Bilge proposes to Looloo, who happily accepts. However, when she tells him about the money, and the plans she's made to help him buy his own ship, his pride makes him indignant and he storms off. However, he later returns and the two agree to marry.

Except for one or two sequences, the mixing of the story and spectacle doesn't jell. The fun is labored and the romance is more painful than sympathetic.\\" Other adaptations The Broadway musical, Hit the Deck , on which this film is based was written by Herbert Fields, with music by Vincent Youmans, and lyrics by Leo Robin and Clifford Grey; it premiered in New York City on April 25, 1927. That musical was based on an earlier play, Shore Leave, written by Hubert Osborne, which premiered in New York City on August 8, 1922. The play had been made into a silent film, also entitled Shore Leave, starring Richard Barthelmess and Dorothy Mackaill. Osborne's play would also be remade into another musical version, Follow the Fleet, in 1936, starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. Preservation status The film is considered a lost film. The last known copy was destroyed in an RKO fire in the 1950s.

It is based on the 1927 stage musical of the same name - which was itself based on the hit 1922 play Shore Leave by Hubert Osborne - and was shot in CinemaScope. Although the film featured some songs from the stage musical, the plot was different. Standards featured in the film include \\"Sometimes I'm Happy\\", \\"I Know that You Know\\", and \\"Hallelujah\\". Plot During \\"Operation Ice Cream\\" at a U.S. Navy reservation in the Arctic, buddies Danny Xavier Smith and Rico Ferrari are exempted from a swimming lesson in the icy water when their friend, Chief Boatswain's Mate William F. Clark, recruits them to bake a birthday cake for the commander. Bill explains that a planeload of replacements is due in, and if they impress the commander with the cake, they may be selected to go home. When Bill leaves them in the kitchen, Danny and Rico admit that neither one knows how to bake, and they come up with the idea to poke holes in another sailor's failed attempt at a cake, fill the holes with rum, then dress the whole thing up with candles and icing. The commander is delighted, but the cake combusts when he blows out the candles, and the three friends find themselves transferred to \\"Operation Mud Pie\\" in a snake-infested swamp. Later, on a two-day shore leave in San Francisco, Bill goes to the nightclub where his fianc√©e Ginger is the star performer. Ginger, who is angry about their six-year engagement, tells Bill that she has found someone else and breaks up with him. Meanwhile, Rico goes to see his widowed mother, who is entertaining her beau, florist Mr. Peroni. After Rico leaves, Peroni, who had been led to believe that Rico was only nine years old, looks at Mrs. Ferrari with new eyes, and they quarrel. Danny, meanwhile, goes to see his father, Rear Admiral Daniel Xavier Smith, one of a long line of admirals in the family. The admiral leaves for an out-of-town meeting, and Danny has a joyful reunion with his older sister Susan, who tells him she is dating actor Wendell Craig and might get a part in his new show. After Susan leaves on her date, Danny goes to the theater where Wendell's show Hit the Deck is rehearsing, and is immediately attracted to dancer Carol Pace. When Carol mentions Wendell's reputation as a womanizer, however, Danny becomes concerned for his sister's safety. Meanwhile, Bill returns to the nightclub and jealously questions Ginger about her new boyfriend, but still declines to set a wedding date. Later, at Wendell's hotel suite, Susan sings for him, and the lecherous actor has just started to make his move when Danny and his friends barge in. While Danny and Bill are fighting with Wendell, Rico forcibly escorts Susan home, and finds himself falling in love with her. Susan gets away and returns to the hotel, and when the shore patrol shows up to investigate the incident, Wendell says he wants to press charges. Alarmed at her brother's predicament, Susan sneaks out, and encountering Rico in the hallway, tells him they must warn Danny and Bill. The two shore patrol men go to the nightclub and question Ginger, but she tells them nothing about Bill's whereabouts. Meanwhile, the sailors, Susan and Carol gather at Mrs. Ferrari's apartment, and she cheers them up with wine and song. Later, the admiral returns home early, and learns from the shore patrol that Danny is in trouble. The following morning, the shore patrol returns to Mrs. Ferrari's apartment, but she delays them while the sailors sneak out and take shelter in Peroni's flower shop. To make Peroni jealous, Rico has Bill pretend to be Mrs. Ferrari's new suitor and send her roses. Peroni delivers the flowers himself, and asks Mrs. Ferrari to marry him, which she happily agrees. Bill then calls on Ginger and finally proposes to her. That evening, shortly before the opening of Hit the Deck, Wendell is attempting to cover his bruises with makeup, when Susan shows up and asks him to withdraw the charges. Wendell agrees, on the condition that the sailors apologize to him in person, and as Susan happily goes off to fetch them, Wendell picks up the phone. Right before the curtain, Susan brings the fellows to Wendell's dressing room, where they find the shore patrol waiting. The men flee, blending in with the chorus members in sailor costumes, as the admiral and his aide Lt. Jackson watch in amazement from the audience. A melee erupts after the opening number, and Susan angrily punches Wendell. The sailors are captured and brought before the admiral, who dresses them down severely, until he learns that the young lady whose honor they were fighting to protect is Susan. After the admiral leaves, Mrs. Ferrari barges in, followed by Carol and Ginger, and the women insist on telling Jackson the whole story. Meanwhile, the admiral goes home and confronts Susan, who reproaches her father for jumping to conclusions, then adds that she is thinking of marrying Rico. Jackson comes to the admiral's house, accompanied by Wendell, who claims that everything was a misunderstanding and withdraws the charges. Jackson privately reveals that Wendell changed his mind, to keep his wife from finding out about the episode with Susan. Later, the three sailors are happily joined with their loves.

He has won three gold, one silver, and one bronze medal in the F32/51 club throw at the Paralympics. In Paralympic F32/51 discus he won one bronze medal. Personal life Stephen Miller was born 26 May 1980, in Cramlington, Northumberland. He started participating in athletics at the age of 11. He joined an after-school club, where he met Paralympian Norman Burns. Burns would later become his coach. He married Rachel Toland in August 2013. He was able to walk down the aisle with her since he had hip replacement surgery the previous October, which he had delayed until after the 2012 London Paralympics. He works part-time as a web developer at Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Gateshead. Miller and his wife founded SMILE Through Sport in 2013. The foundation encourages disabled people to participate in sports. He currently lives in his hometown of Cramlington. Career =1996 Paralympics= The 1996 Paralympic Games in Atlanta were Miller's first Paralympic Games. He competed in the F50 club throw, winning with a distance of 25.84 metres. At the age of 16 he became Great Britain's youngest Paralympian or Olympian track and field competitors to win a gold medal. =2000 Paralympics= He won gold in the club throw at the 2000 Paralympics in Sydney. At the 2000 Games he originally placed fourth in discus with a throw of 14.99 metres. His team lodged a complaint against gold-medal winner Robert Jachimowicz, saying his disability status was improperly classified. Jachimowicz was disqualified, and Miller advanced to the bronze medal position. =2004 Paralympics= Miller competed in the F32/51 club throw at the 2004 Paralympics in Athens. He won the event with a world-record breaking throw of 33.53 metres, beating the record set in 2000 by over seven metres. All six of his attempts would have been long enough to secure the gold medal. Miller won several medals at the Cerebral Palsy World Championships in 2005, including gold in the F32 club and gold in the F32 discus. He won his third consecutive gold medal for club throwing at the World Championships in 2006. =2008 Paralympics= While training at the Australian Institute of Sport for the 2008 Paralympic Games, Miller broke the F32 club throw world record with a distance of 34.93 metres. Miller had won gold in the club throw in the previous three Paralympic Games. Despite throwing for a personal best of 34.37 metres, he lost to new world-record holder Mourad Idoudi of Tunisia. Miller had owned that record since 1997. He finished the event with a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing. =2012 Paralympics= He was selected as captain of the men's athletics squad for Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics. He had hip problems that required surgery to fix, and doctors thought he would take about a year to recover. He did not want to miss his home Paralympic Games in London so he competed through the pain. He failed to qualify for the finals. He underwent surgery for his hip following the Games. New Paralympic Committee rules cut off his funding, as only athletes projected to medal at the next Games were funded. =2016 Paralympics= Miller won a silver medal at the 2014 European Championships. With his poor performance at the 2012 Paralympics, his goal was to be on the podium at the 2016 Paralympic Games. Initially his mother, who is also his coach, did not have enough funds to travel to the Games. Former owner of Newcastle United John Hall donated money to allow her to attend the event. There were ten competitors in the F32 club throw, but four failed to show up to the event prior to the start time. He earned a bronze medal with a season-best throw of 31.58 metres. He also won a bronze medal at the IPC World Championships in 2017 and a silver medal at the European Championships in 2018. =2020 Paralympics= He is currently training for the 2020 Paralympic Games in Tokyo. He started a crownfunding campaign to facilitate training and competition opportunities. Awards and honours Miller was awarded the Freedom of Gateshead on 25 June 2013. He was awarded the Freedom of Gateshead. He was awarded the Freedom of Cramlington on 7 February 2014. Miller was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2016 New Year Honours for services to sport.

Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs, U.S. Department of State (February 2008). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain.Ministry of Education of Panama As of the 2004/2005 school year there were about 430,000 students enrolled in grades one through six (95% attendance). The total enrollment in the six secondary grades for the same period was 253,900 (60% attendance). More than 91% of Panamanians are literate. As of 2004, more than 92,500 Panamanian students attended the University of Panama, the Technological University of Panama, West Coast University ‚Äì Panama, Polytechnic University of Central America and the University of Santa Maria La Antigua, a private Catholic institution. Including smaller colleges, there are 88 institutions of higher education in Panama. History Public education began in Panama soon after separating from Colombia in 1903. In 1906, the Panama College was found by Methodists. Nowadays it is called the Panamerican Institute. The first efforts were guided by a paternalistic view of the goals of education, as evidenced in comments made in a 1913 meeting of the First Panamanian Educational Assembly: \\"The cultural heritage given to the child should be determined by the social position he will or should occupy. For this reason, sex education should be different in accordance with the social class to which the student should be related.\\" This elitist focus changed rapidly under United States influence. By the 1920s, Panamanian education subscribed to a progressive educational system, explicitly designed to assist the able and ambitious individual in search of upward social mobility. Successive national governments gave a high priority to the development of a system of (at least) universal primary education. In the late 1930s, as much as one-fourth of the national budget went to education. Between 1920 and 1934, primary-school enrollment doubled. Adult illiteracy, more than 70 percent in 1923, dropped to roughly half the adult population in scarcely more than a decade. By the early 1950s, adult illiteracy had dropped to 28 percent. The rate of gain had also declined and further improvements were slow in coming. The 1950s saw essentially no improvement; adult world life illiteracy was 27 percent in 1960. There were notable gains in the 1960s, however, and the rate of adult illiteracy dropped 8 percentage points by 1970. According to 1980 estimates, only 13 percent of Panamanians over 10 years of age were illiterate. Men and women were approximately equally represented among the literate. The most notable disparity was between urban and rural Panama; 94 percent of city-dwelling adults were literate but less than two-thirds of those in the countryside were‚Äîa figure that also represented continued high illiteracy rates among the country's Indian population. From the 1950s through the early 1980s, education enrollments expanded faster than the rate of population growth as a whole and, for most of that period, faster than the school-age population. The steepest increases came in secondary and higher education enrollments, which increased ten and more than thirty times respectively. By the mid-1980s, primary school enrollment rates were roughly 113 percent of the primary-school-aged population. Male and female enrollments were relatively equal overall, although there were significant regional variations. High school students from Panama City Enrollments at upper levels of schooling had increased strikingly in relative and absolute terms since 1960. Between 1960 and the mid-1980s, secondary-school enrollments expanded some four-and-a-half times and higher education nearly twelve-fold. In 1965, fewer than one-third of children of secondary school age were in school and only 7 percent of people ages 20 to 24 years. In the mid-1980s, almost two-thirds of secondary-school-age children were enrolled, and about 20 percent of individuals ages 20 to 24 years were in institutions of higher education. Currently Panama has an overall literacy rate of more than 94%. Educational levels of Panama = Preschool level = The preschool level is aimed at children between 4 and 5 years old; There are two stages of education, pre-kindergarten and kindergarten, both with a duration of 1 year each. = Primary level = The elementary level has a duration of 6 years and is aimed at students between the ages of six and twelve. Basic subjects such as Spanish, English, Mathematics, Natural Science, Social Science, Arts, Music, Technology, Physical Education, Home Education and Agriculture are taught. = First Step of Secondary Level = The next stage is the pre-media cycle with a duration of 3 years, aimed at students between 12 and 15 years of age. At the end of this level the student receives the Certificate of General Basic Education. The objective is to favor that all students of school age reach, according to their potential, the full development of their abilities and skills to be able to follow their professional or work path. The areas of study are: Spanish, Geography, History, Civics, Science, Technology, Typing, Arts, Industrial Arts, Music, Mathematics, Notions of Commerce and Accounting, Physical Education, Agriculture and English. = Second Step of Secondary Level = It lasts 3 years (or 2 years in alternative schools) and is aimed at students between 15 and 18 years old. At the end of this stage the student receives the High School Diploma in one of the following modalities: * Sciences * Humanities * Commerce * Accounting * Information Technology * Agriculture * Pedagogy * Tourism * Maritime Services * Technical modalities like: Cooling and Air Conditioning, Construction, Electricity, Electronics, Autotronic or Mechanical Technology * Institutional Service and Management * Home Education * Arts The modality is chosen by the student just before the end of pre-media, and it cannot be changed afterwards, except in rare circumstances. = Higher Education = Higher education in Panama is divided into 2 types: University Superior and Non-University Superior. University higher education is taught in several official and private universities. Official or state universities are autonomous state educational entities dedicated to human development and high- quality professional training at an affordable cost. They are responsible for overseeing that the professional education given in private universities meets the highest quality standards, they are also responsible for homologating the degrees obtained in universities in other countries. The State Universities of Panama are: * Panama University *Autonomous University of Chiriqui * Technology University of Panama * International Maritime University of Panama * Specialized University of the Americas Private universities in Panama are duly accredited to offer a whole range of professions and are constantly evaluated to ensure the highest standard and quality of their careers: Some private universities are: * Santa Mar√≠a La Antigua Catholic University * Latin University of Panama * University of the Isthmus * University of Santander \\"\\" USantander \\"\\" * American University of Panama * Inter-American University of Distance Education * Metropolitan University of Education Science and Technology \\"\\" UMECIT \\"\\" * Inter-American University of Panama \\"\\" IPU \\"\\" * Christian University of Panama * Columbus University * ISAE University * INCAE University * Florida State University * University of Art GANEXA * University of the Caribbean In general, undergraduate studies have a duration of 4 years, with the exceptions being exact sciences and engineering careers, that last 5 years and health sciences careers that last 6 years. Postgraduate studies have a duration that varies depending on the career. Higher non-university education is made up of \\"Higher Education Institutes\\" or \\"Higher Education Centers\\" that provide diplomas and professional technical training of the highest level. Among the State Superior Institutes are: * National Institute for Vocational Training and Training for Human Development (INADEH) * Superior Police Institute President Belisario Porras. * Higher Institute of Agriculture * Higher Institute of Aeronautical Vocational Training * Panama International Banking Institute * Higher Institute of Criminal Investigations and Forensic Sciences * Higher Education Center \\"Dr.Justo Arosemena\\" of the National Police of Panama * Superior Academy of Benem√©rito Fire Department of Panama * Higher Technical Institute of the East Among the private higher institutes are: * Higher Polytechnic Institute of America * Higher Institute of Computing Technology * Higher Institute of Microfinance * Higher Institute of Haute Cuisine (ISAC) * Higher Institute of Science and Technology * Higher Institute of Specialized Security * Instituto Superior The Panama Internacional Hotel School * Higher Institute of Commerce and Education * Higher Institute of Education and Vocational Training * Latin American Higher Institute of Naval Administration and Technology * * Higher Institute Fly Corporation Aviation Training * Instituto T√©cnico Superior de Cocina, S.A. * Higher Pedagogical Institute * Cooperative Education Institute * National Vocational Training Institute * Center for Higher Education in Administration and Security * ASSA Study Center * Panama Regional Studies Center * Center for Higher Studies * Higher Studies Technical Center * Higher Technology Center of Panama * Albrook Flight Institute References External links * Education in The Republic of Panama Category:Panamanian society ","title":"Education in Panama"},{"id":"18092477","text":"T√™te Blanche (lit.
