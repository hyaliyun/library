They are the antagonists of the series' fifth and final story arc, called Stars in the original manga and Sailor Moon Sailor Stars in its anime adaptation. Shadow Galactica is first introduced in chapter #43 \\"Stars 1\\", originally published in Japan's Nakayoshi magazine on March 28, 1996. Shadow Galactica as an organization devotes itself to stealing starseeds, the essence of sentient life, from all in the universe. Its members are led by Sailor Galaxia and have the ultimate goal of reorganizing the universe in the image that Chaos desires. The Sailor Moon musicals state that they have already conquered 80% of the Milky Way galaxy, and all 88 constellations - with only Sailor Moon's solar system remaining. Sailor Galaxia's castle, , serves as Shadow Galactica's base of operations in the manga. Galactica Palace is located at the Galactic Center, in Sagittarius Zero Star, and it is built around the Galaxy Cauldron, the birthplace of all life in the Milky Way. In the first anime adaptation, Shadow Galactica's base is . Key figures =Sailor Galaxia= is an orange-haired human-like female alien and the main antagonist of the fifth story arc. She is the self-proclaimed \\"Golden Queen of Shadow Galactica\\", and is also described as the Guardian of Solitude. According to Naoko Takeuchi, Galaxia was created as a Sailor Guardian \\"to rival Sailor Moon\\", and her golden uniform and costume was described by her as very difficult to draw. Before the events of Sailor Moon, Sailor Galaxia lived on a small planet she deemed \\"trash\\". She wandered until the day her powers awakened. Without feeling any purpose for herself, and lacking satisfaction in the role of a mere Sailor Guardian, Galaxia began to crave power. She left her planet in search of another homeland and in her travels, she comes upon Chaos in the form of Wiseman, who showed her what she was looking for--the Galaxy Cauldron. She discovers that for her to gain control of the Galaxy Cauldron, she has to gather the Sailor Crystals, the starseeds of the Sailor Guardians of the galaxy. Those powers combined together with that of Sailor Moon would give her the power to destroy Chaos and rule the galaxy. She then created Shadow Galactica and began traveling to planet after planet, turning them into places of death and stealing the starseeds of their guardian Sailor Guardians. In her first conquest on Earth, she steals Mamoru's Golden Crystal; and after that, she and her henchwomen steal the Sailor Crystals of each of the Sailor Guardians on Earth until only Usagi and Chibichibi are left. At the Galaxy Cauldron, Galaxia fights them, until Chaos attempts to kill Galaxia by blasting her off a cliff. Sailor Moon rescues her from falling over the cliff into the cauldron, and Galaxia finally realizes that she has always really wanted love, not power. By accepting Usagi's offer of friendship, the bracelets which supplied Galaxia with life and power shatter, and she dies peacefully. In the anime adaptation, Sailor Galaxia is the strongest Sailor Guardian in the Milky Way. Before the beginning of the series, she ends the Sailor Wars by sealing the source of all malice, Chaos, within her body to save the cosmos. To prevent her starseed ‚Äî the \\"Light of Hope\\" ‚Äî from being corrupted by Chaos, Galaxia expelled it from her body and sends it into the galaxy in the form of Chibichibi. Becoming possessed by Chaos, Galaxia destroys various planets. Planning to steal the starseeds in the Solar System, Galaxia breaks the seal of Queen Nehelenia to force the awakening of Sailor Saturn. After Nehelenia's redemption, Galaxia uses the Sailor Animamates to steal the Sailor Crystals, but they are unsuccessful. Eventually, after killing Tuxedo Mask, Princess Kakyuu and most of the Sailor Guardians, she fights Sailor Moon and the Sailor Starlights. In the climax of the battle, Chaos completely possesses Galaxia, whose skin turns light grey and her uniform turns black, with bat-like wings. In the end, Sailor Moon refuses to fight Galaxia, and releases Chaos from her body. She leaves and returns to space, intent on returning the stolen starseeds. In the Sailor Moon musicals, Galaxia features prominently in the Sailor Moon Sailor Stars musical and in its revision, the Eien Densetsu musical and in its revision, Shin Densetsu Kourin, Starlights - Ryuusei Densetsu and Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin. Her musical story is similar to both the manga and anime adaptation. As in the manga, the final showdown with Galaxia often occurs in the Galaxy Cauldron. As in the anime, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune pose as Galaxia's henchwomen. Galaxia generally employs fewer Animamates in the musicals than in either the manga or anime, but several times she resurrects villains from past arcs. Depending on the musical's story, Galaxia is either the final or penultimate enemy the Sailor Guardians must defeat. In Eien Densetsu, Galaxia is successfully purged of evil and sacrifices herself to help the Guardians destroy Chaos, who had been posing as a low-ranking minion. In another version of the ending, Queen Beryl will become Queen Metalia and fight alongside Galaxia, who will herself become Sailor Chaos after being completely possessed by Chaos, forcing the Guardians to defeat them both.2004 Winter Seramyu Musical Kakyuu-Ouhi Kourin In the anime series, her voice actress is Mitsuko Horie. In English, her voice is provided by Carrie Keranen. In the stage musicals, five different actresses have portrayed her: Saori Sara, Tamami Matsumoto, Takemi, Yumie Sakaguchi and Coco Isuzu. Matsumoto stated that she greatly enjoyed the role: \\"ordering people around and being above others is such a great feeling\\". Sailor Moon Musical 1998 Eien Densetsu kaiteiban (Senshuuraku) - Eikyuu Honzonban Video =Chaos= is the true main antagonist of the Sailor Moon series. Chaos appears as an enormous mass of black fourth-dimensional space. It is revealed that Chaos was a being who failed to become a star, and that it merged itself with the Galaxy Cauldron, so destroying Chaos would result in the destruction of the Cauldron as well. It emerges that during the course of the series that Chaos sends out incarnations in the form of Sailor Moon's major enemies (Queen Metalia, Wiseman, Master Pharaoh 90 and Queen Nehelenia), and eventually uses Sailor Galaxia to steal Sailor Crystals to attract Sailor Moon to the Cauldron. In the end, with the help of all of the Guardians, Sailor Moon is able to force it into the Cauldron and everyone who was killed is sent back, each to their planet and time of origin, reincarnated after the battle. However it is indicated that Chaos is not dead and will come back as Sailor Chaos much the same as it did in Sailor Cosmos's future. In the anime adaptation, Galaxia reveals herself as the guardian who sealed Chaos within her own body and thus saved the galaxy. She holds the golden bracelets created for her by Chaos which grants her eternal life and the power to extract starseeds. She also gives each Sailor Animamate a pair to wear. Chaos corrupts Galaxia, so that Galaxia can fight the Light of Hope, which is Galaxia's own star seed. However, Sailor Moon is able to reach the small bit of hope left in Galaxia's own heart, and she releases Chaos from her body. Chaos leaves Galaxia to inhabit the hearts of all people, which was stated to be its original residence. In the Eien Densetsu musical, Chaos appears as , another male servant of Galaxia. He functions as comic relief and is apparently very weak.Rei Hino in civilian form is able to beat him up after he works with the other Shadow Galactica members to frame Rei for a crime. He disguises himself as the director of a school play that the younger Guardians are starring in and also poses as the Three Lights' manager. Later on in the musical, he makes a deal to assist Sailor Moon, taking her and the Starlights to the Galaxy Cauldron and promising to save a Sailor Guardian from death (he saves Sailor Mercury). However, after Galaxia's defeat, Kyaosu reveals himself to be Chaos. With his power sealed inside Galaxia, he was forced to inhabit a weak physical shell. After Moon purged his energy from Galaxia, however, he regains his full strength and once more threatens to destroy the galaxy. He is defeated when all the Guardians, including a revived Galaxia, combine their powers. Ryuuji Kasahara played the role of Chaos. Sailor Chaos represents Chaos reborn. According to Sailor Cosmos, Chaos will emerge from the Galaxy Cauldron reborn as a powerful Sailor Guardian. Sailor Cosmos, frustrated with an ongoing battle against Sailor Chaos, disguised herself as ChibiChibi to travel back in time and convince Sailor Moon to destroy the Galaxy Cauldron, and thereby to prevent Sailor Chaos emerging to start a new series of devastating wars. Sailor Chaos never actually appears as a living character in the Stars manga, which displays a vague image only once ‚Äî as a flash-forward ‚Äî when mentioning her. Sailor Animamates The are Sailor Galaxia's main reapers of starseeds. They bear names prefixed by the title \\"Sailor\\" followed by the name of a chemical element (usually a metal or an alloy) and the name of an animal. They are led by Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi in the manga, by Sailor Lead Crow in the anime, and by Sailor Pewter Fox in many of the musicals. Despite the titles, none of them is a true Sailor Guardian but merely normal living-beings who gave up their own star-seeds to Galaxia to become one -- each of them murdered the Guardian of their home planet in order to win Galaxia's favor.Act 45. The victims of three Animamates are explicitly named: Sailor Coronis, Sailor Mau and Sailor Ch≈´ (Sailor Coronis is the only one of the dead Guardians to ever be pictured in the manga). Two more Guardians are implied by the mention of devastated planets called Mermaid and Cocoon, home planets of Aluminum Seiren and Heavy Metal Papillon respectively. In the anime adaptation, Princess Kakyuu states that Sailor Tin Nyanko was once a true Sailor Guardian. The Animamates disguise themselves as employees of Tokyo's primary television station, Galaxy TV, to get closer to their victims. Under Galaxia's command, they search for true star-seeds whose shines can survive exposure to the outside world. Each of them were given a pair of Galaxia's golden bracelets that grants them the power to become a Sailor Guardian, extract starseeds and even turn their victims into Phage. They gave up their own Sailor Crystals to Galaxia to possess them, therefore taking the bracelets out would instantly kill them. Eternal Sailor Moon matches them at every turn: she alone has the power to heal Phage and restore star seeds to innocents. They can warp from place to place using a black phone booth. All five of the original Animamates appear in various Sailor Moon musicals, including Sailor Stars, Eien Densetsu, Starlights Ryuusei Densetsu, and Kakyuu Ouhi Kourin. They pose as a dance troupe called the \\"Dancing Animamates\\" and go by pseudonyms: Iron Mouse as \\"Ch≈´ Rat\\", Aluminum Seiren as \\"Half Bird\\", Lead Crow as \\"Manila Karasu\\", etc. In addition, the musicals introduce two new Animamates: Sailor Pewter Fox and Sailor Titanium Kerokko. =Sailor Iron Mouse= appears first of the Sailor Animamates. True to her name of mouse, Iron Mouse is very short, at least a foot shorter than all her targets (Takeuchi's notes in the manga state that she is Chibiusa's height, but she is not quite that short in the anime). Iron Mouse fights the Sailor Guardians during the joint concert between the Three Lights and Michiru Kaioh. She is the first one killed by Sailor Star Healer. It later emerges that Iron Mouse killed Sailor Ch≈´, the Guardian from her home planet Ch≈´, taking her star-seed so that Iron Mouse could be a Sailor Guardian. In the anime adaptation, she goes by the human pseudonym . This pseudonym has a name expressing word-play: in Japanese, Ch≈´ko and Nezu are each perfectly acceptable names; however, \\"ch≈´\\" is the sound made by mice, and nezu is short for nezumi, which means \\"mouse\\". She exhibits a personality both childlike and intense; she usually chooses famous or impressive people as her victims, seems to enjoy her work, and is openly fearful of Galaxia. She is also known to travel in a TARDIS. She is also afraid of cats. After failing to steal the star seeds, she becomes the first one killed by Galaxia. In the anime series, her voice actress is Eriko Hara in Japanese. In English, she is voiced by Katie Leigh. In the musicals, Chie Maruyama, Aki Kudo and Shion Aoki portray Iron Mouse. =Sailor Aluminum Seiren= becomes the second of the Sailor Animamates to appear. The Greek word Seiren in her name means the same as the English Siren and often appears romanized as such.The katakana of this character's name read seiren, like the Greek word. When the English word \\"siren\\" is used in Japanese, it is spelled and pronounced sairen. Takeuchi frequently used non-English, non-Japanese words in naming her characters. Hitoshi Doi uses the romanization \\"Siren\\". Aluminum Seiren first appears in Act 44 on the roof of J≈´ban High School and attacks Usagi and Seiya with Galactica Tsunami. She succeeds in stealing the starseeds of Sailor Mercury and Sailor Jupiter, killing them instantly; then Sailor Star Maker and Sailor Star Fighter kill her. According to the Materials Collection, she sings and writes ballads as a hobby. In the anime adaptation, Aluminum Seiren makes her first appearance in episode 182. Her human pseudonym is , which may be a pun on \\"puppet,\\" \\"mermaid,\\" \\"makeup\\" and \\"child spirit.\\" She is very polite, ditzy and oblivious when off-duty, and is always eating or feeling hungry; once engaged in battle, however, she drops her flaws and becomes completely ruthless. Aluminum Seiren works together with Sailor Lead Crow, who reveals that they once competed for the position of Number One Animamate. She eventually discovers Sailor Moon's identity and nearly succeeds in killing her, but the Inner Guardians and the Sailor Starlights stopped her. Despite learning their identities, as well as finding a strong star seed, Aluminum Seiren is killed by Galaxia for failing to kill Sailor Moon. She is voiced by Kikuko Inoue in Japanese and by Faye Mata in English. In the musicals, she is played by Anri Oonuki and Yuka Kobayashi. =Sailor Lead Crow= is the third of the Sailor Animamates to appear. The Tokyopop manga translated her name as Red Crow. Lead Crow first appears in Act 45 at Rei Hino's temple to confront her fellow Coronians, Phobos and Deimos -- who are actually Rei's guardians. Using Galactica Tornado, she succeeds in stealing their starseeds before Sailor Moon destroys her with her Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss attack. It is later revealed that Lead Crow killed Sailor Coronis, the Guardian from Coronis (home planet of Phobos, Deimos, and Lead Crow), taking her star-seed so that Lead Crow could be a Sailor Guardian. According to the Materials Collection, besides using Galactica Tornado, Lead Crow can also manipulate rot, and is known for being a sadist. In its anime adaptation, Lead Crow first appears as a partner of Aluminum Seiren. She is said to be the leader of the Animamates, and calls her partner her \\"greatest rival\\"; however, she harbors great concern for her fellow Animamate, and when Aluminum Seiren is killed, tries to carry on the same work. Her human pseudonym in the anime is , which is taken from the words for a certain shade of red (pronounced the same as \\"lead\\" in Japanese) and for \\"crow\\". Despite having a bad temper, Lead Crow is very intelligent and is a skilled fighter, often attacking her enemies with a whip.In episode 193, she manages to defeat all four Guardian Soldiers in battle, being the only Animamate to engage them in combat. She dislikes Tin Nyanko, but partners with her for a time, which leads to her being killed by her own trap when Tin Nyanko sabotages it. Lead Crow appeared in a few of the musicals, including \\"Starlights - Ryuusei Densetsu\\" and its revision. Like the rest of the Animamates, she poses as a member of a dancing troupe known as the Dancing Animamates. She acts as choreographer for the group. \\"Ryuusei Densetsu\\" also presents her as Japan's leading expert in Filipino dance, a play on her name.Manila is the capital of the Philippines In the anime, Lead Crow is voiced by Chiharu Suzuka. In the English dub, she is voiced by Andi Rich. In the musicals, she is played by Ado Endoh and Irya Yuuto. =Sailor Tin Nyanko= , the fourth of the Sailor Animamates to appear. Her human pseudonym is , which is drawn from her Guardian name and from suzu, the Japanese word for both \\"tin\\" and \\"bell.\\" Nyanko is a colloquial term for a cat, drawn from nyan (the Japanese equivalent of meow). Her pseudonym in the English manga is Kitty Bell. She has a cold personality, willing to kill anyone who is in her way. Tin Nyanko first appears in Act 45 as Nyanko Suzu, a new transfer student from Libya. Like Lead Crow, she confronts people from her home planet, Mau--in this case, Luna and Artemis. Diana arrives and tries to protect them, but Tin Nyanko's Galactica Puppet attack transforms all three into their humanoid selves, then injures the crescent moon markings on their foreheads and turns them into ordinary and badly injured cats. Sailor Star Fighter attacks her, and although she escapes unharmed, she is killed by Galaxia. It is revealed that Tin Nyanko killed Sailor Mau, the Guardian of her home planet, taking her star-seed so that Tin Nyanko could be a Sailor Guardian. Luna and Artemis call Sailor Mau their planet's only hero (her planet's name comes from a real species of cat called the Egyptian Mau). According to the Materials Collection, Tin Nyanko also has the ability to manipulate scents and supposedly has nine lives. In the anime adaptation, Tin Nyanko is a rival to Sailors Lead Crow and Aluminum Seiren. She is partly responsible for both their deaths, and in the process learns Sailor Moon's identity. During their confrontation, Usagi attempts to heal her with her attack, and succeeds only in knocking off one of her bracelets. This allows Nyanko's true personality to partially reveal itself. However, she is torn between her duty to kill the Sailor Guardians and a new urge to rebel against her master. However, Sailor Galaxia decides to kill her. In the Sailor Stars musical and its revision, Sailor Tin Nyanko was one of Galaxia's henchwomen sent to Earth to destroy the Sailor Guardians. She participated in Juuban High School's musical festival alongside the other Animamates. She was able to assist in the group attack Galactica Twister alongside Pewter Fox and Titanium Kerokko. In the anime series, she is voiced by Ikue ≈åtani in Japanese and by Corina Boettger in English. She was played by Tomomi Seo, Toni Hosokawa and Miu Hashigaki in the musicals. =Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon= is the fifth and last of the Sailor Animamates to appear. Her name incorporates the French word for butterfly; in Japanese culture, butterflies are often considered to be symbolic of the soul. In the Materials Collection artbook, and the musical Ryuusei Densetsu, the word \\"Heavy\\" is omitted from her name. Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon comes from the planet Cocoon. Known as the \\"Soul Hunter,\\" Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon guards a graveyard in the center of the galaxy, surrounded by butterflies. These butterflies are the remnants of the dead Sailor Guardians whose Sailor Crystals had been taken. She shows Eternal Sailor Moon, Sailor Kakyuu, and ChibiChibi the graves that had been dug for them, binds them with vines, and prepares to burn them to death. The three are saved by the arrival of Sailor Chibi Moon and the Sailor Quartet, who destroy Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon with their group attack. The Materials Collection states that Sailor Heavy Metal Papillon manipulates fire, and attacks with Galactica Scales, although this attack is not named in the manga. Furthermore, she is described as a parent as well as a samba dancer, and has \\"high sex appeal.\\" She also appears in the musicals, portrayed by Keiko Endoh. =Sailor Pewter Fox= is the leader of the Animamates in the Sailor Stars musical.The credits for the DVD release of the musical list \\"Animamates Leader\\" next to Sailor Pewter Fox's name in the credits. She does not appear in any other continuity. While her animal namesake is red, she actually wears gray, likely in reference to the metal in her name. She gets many solos, indicating the character's high rank in Shadow Galactica. She is sent to Earth to destroy the Sailor Guardians. She participated in Juuban High School's musical festival alongside the other Animamates. She attacks with Galactica Mirage, and aids Tin Nyanko and Titanium Kerokko in Galactica Twister. She also aided in Sailor Galactica Attack. Two actresses have played her: Rei Ku and Junko Iemura. = Sailor Titanium Kerokko = appears in the two versions of the Sailor Stars musical, and in Eien Densetsu, where she is called Sailor Mitis Kerokko. She does not appear in any other continuity. Her name comes from the Japanese onomatopoeia for the noise that a frog makes.Sailor Titanium Kerokko She had no attack of her own, but instead aided Tin Nyanko and Pewter Fox in Galactica Twister. She also aided in Sailor Galactica Attack. She has been played by two actresses, Haruko Yamaguchi and Megumi Wakamatsu. Servants =Sailor Lethe and Sailor Mnemosyne= and are twin sisters that appear only in the manga. Sailor Lethe is named for a naiad in Greek mythology, and for a river of the Greek underworld where dead souls go to forget their past lives before being reincarnated. Sailor Mnemosyne is named for the Titaness of memory, the mother of the muses, as well as another river in the underworld which brought remembrance and omniscience. Sailor Lethe has an attack called Galactica Myosotis Alpestris, which she used to attack Usagi. Myosotis alpestris is the name of an alpine species of Forget-me-not. They come from the conjoined twin planets Lethe and Mnemosyne, respectively. Their planets were small, poor, and plagued by violence and chaos. When Galaxia appeared and brought death and ruin, the two had no choice but to follow her in the hopes of someday finding peace. Sailor Lethe first introduces herself as the ferryman of the River of Oblivion, trapping Sailor Moon at the bottom. She kills Luna, Artemis, and Diana, and attacks Sailor Moon. She is stopped by Sailor Mnemosyne, who says that Sailor Moon has been hurt enough. Lethe says that Sailor Moon's Sailor Crystal is the cause for all of the wars they are experiencing, and that if it is destroyed, there will be peace. Sailor Moon offers her life if it will end the violence. Lethe and Mnemosyne are so moved by her self-sacrifice that they realize that whether or not Sailor Moon dies, the war will continue. Just as they are about to release the Guardians, Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi appear. They call Lethe and Mnemosyne useless fools and take their Sailor Crystals, which kills them. In the musical Le Mouvement Final, Lethe and Mnemosyne do not appear but their roles are taken by Sailors Lead Crow and Aluminum Seiren, respectively. =Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi= and are Galaxia's closest servants in the manga. They are named for two letters of the Greek alphabet, X (Chi) and Œ¶ (Phi). Each carries a staff with a sun symbol on top of it, which they can use to fight. Sailor Phi also uses an attack called Galactica Plants Blizzard. The pair are known as the \\"Star Gardeners\\", and watch over the starseeds that are kept in the Star Garden, which is set around Galactica Palace. They serve as messengers for Galaxia, overseeing her other servants and reporting on their actions. Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi are responsible for the deaths of all three Sailor Starlights, Princess Kakyuu, Sailors Lethe and Mnemosyne, and probably many others. They are defeated by Eternal Sailor Moon in Act 49, but not before they greatly increase Galaxia's power. In the musicals, Sailor Chi and Sailor Phi are often seen with Sailor Theta, but they are Galaxia's lowest ranked servants, collectively known as \\"Galactica Troops\\". They receive their orders from the other members of Shadow Galactica, and there is no indication that they have a special role as Star Gardeners. In the first Stars musical, Sailor Phi goes by the name \\"Shadow Bee\\", while Sailor Chi goes by \\"Shadow Mantis\\". Their costumes are also altered to be completely different from their manga counterparts and to match Theta. They use a group attack with Sailor Theta called Galactica Cry, and one with Theta, Buttress and MC Fly called Sailor Galactica Attack. Sailor Chi has been portrayed on stage by Ado Endoh, Sachiko Akimoto, and Mari Yasuda. Sailor Phi has been portrayed by Kaori Ishikawa, Rieko Akimoto and Mika Komura. =Sailor Theta= is a musical only character, and the third member of the Galactica Troops. She is a servant of Galaxia always seen accompanying Sailors Phi and Chi and, like them, is named after a Greek letter (Theta, written Œò). In the Stars musical she goes by the name \\"Shadow Bug\\". This bug theme was dropped for the revision. The Galactica Troops disguise themselves as J≈´ban Municipal High School students or a backup dancers for the Three Lights (depending on the musical) in order to observe the Sailor Guardians, and eventually attack them. The three of them engage a revived Queen Beryl in combat but are defeated by her, and subsequently killed by Galaxia for their failure. Sailor Theta has been played by Y≈´ko Matsumoto, Ado Endoh, and Azusa Katagiri. =Sailor Buttress= only appears in the Stars musical. By definition, buttresses function as decorative supports for buildings, and Sailor Buttress functions the same way to Galaxia. She is Galaxia's adviser and herald,Stars Musical DVD Credits and gives orders to the Animamates, the Galactica Troops, and MC Fly. Her uniform bears a striking resemblance to Galaxia's fully possessed form from the anime, sans wings, with a normal complexion (instead of grey), and retaining the golden bracelets. She had no attack of her own, but instead shouted Sailor Galactica Attack alongside the other members of Shadow Galactica. Unlike the other members other than Galaxia, she does not take on a civilian identity in the musical. Shiori Seki portrayed Sailor Buttress. =MC Fly= , a male servant of Galaxia, leads the Galactica Troops. He only appeared in the Stars musical and its revised edition. He appeared first as the Master of Ceremonies (hence his name) for a school talent-competition, clad in a Phantom of the Opera styled outfit. His true form was that of a fly-man, with antenna on his head and wings. He could shapeshift and took the form of Endymion to fight Tuxedo Mask. After the Sailor Moon Sailor Stars musical, the bug theme was dropped. He does not have an attack of his own, but he does perform Sailor Galactica Attack alongside the rest of Shadow Galactica. Ryuuji Kasahara, who later played Kyaosu, portrayed him. =Other members= In the manga, Galaxia revives Tuxedo Mask and the Sailor Team and forces them into her service. While under her control, they battle Eternal Sailor Moon, Sailor Chibi Moon, and Sailor ChibiChibi with evil Galactica versions of their normal attacks. They attack in turn and together, injuring Sailor Moon and breaking her wings before she finally destroys their bracelets. They are reduced to ash, but their Sailor Crystals hang in the air briefly before Galaxia reclaims them. In the anime, Galaxia frees Queen Nehelenia from the seal and encourages her to take her revenge by unleashing a nightmare upon the \\"people of the White Moon\\". Galaxia provides her with the Black Mirror to aid her in her plans. It is not revealed until the final few episodes that Galaxia contracted Nehelenia into her service for the sole purpose of forcing Sailor Saturn to reawaken her Guardian powers, as at the time Hotaru was merely an infant. Also in the anime, Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune willingly join her so that they can \\"remain together forever\\". Shortly afterwards they kill Sailor Pluto and Sailor Saturn. While they initially lead Eternal Sailor Moon and the Starlights to believe that they are under Galaxia's control, their act is just a ruse to get close enough to Galaxia to kill her. When she orders them to take the Starseeds of Sailor Moon and the Starlights, they turn on her and attempt to take her starseed instead. However, because Galaxia no longer has her starseed, their sneak attack fails and she removes their bracelets. They die holding each other's hand moments later. This scene is replicated in various musicals featuring Galaxia and has the song Orleans no Sei Senshi~Uranus-Neptune no Uragiri (Holy Guardians of Orleans~Uranus and Neptune's betrayal) appear in each version. In the musicals, Galaxia often resurrects antagonists from past arcs to join her other servants. Most frequently she brings back Queen Beryl, who works with Galaxia in Eien Densetsu, its revised edition, and Shin Densetsu Kourin. The Amazon Trio are made members in Shin Densetsu Kourin. Beryl's Four Kings of Heaven are revived alongside her in Starlights - Ryuusei Densetsu and Kakyuu- Ouhi Kourin - The Second Stage Final. Phage The term occurs only in the anime. It describes any monster of the week formed by the use of Galaxia's golden armlets, which are infused with the power of Chaos and are used by a Sailor Animamate. After an Animamate has extracted the starseed from a normal person they would often abandon each of them upon discovering that the victim only has a \\"normal\\" starseed before their brightness fades away. A person's starseed will then turn black as it corrupts and transforms the person into a sort of parody Sailor Guardian (gender being retained). They change shape based on their dominant personality trait or hobby, and take on exaggerated mannerisms and names such as \\"Sailor Guts\\", \\"Sailor Teacher\\", or \\"Sailor Antique\\". After fighting the Phage, Eternal Sailor Moon has the power to restore them to their normal forms and to return their normal starseed back into their human bodies using the Starlight Honeymoon Therapy Kiss attack and the Silver Moon Crystal Power Kiss attack. Princess Kakyuu is implied to have this power as well. Those who possess \\"true\\" starseeds (i.e. the Sailor Guardians and Tuxedo Mask) do not transform into Phage, and if their starseeds are taken, their body fades away killing them instantly. While Phage do not appear in the manga or musicals, they are referenced in one of the songs in the musical. Reception In a review of the final season of the anime for Anime News Network, author Rebecca Silverman described Sailor Galaxia as a threat that \\"looms over Earth and the solar system [...] attempting to take over every planet, and she's just come to Earth to continue her plans.\\" Silverman also compared the Sailor Animamates with the Four Kings of Heaven, explaining that while both groups are not similar to each other, the way in which the Animamates pick their victims follows \\"the standard operating procedure of all Sailor Moon villains ‚Äì find the most famous or prettiest person and just assume they're who you want, rinse, repeat.\\" In particular, the author found Iron Mouse as one of the more \\"endearing\\" antagonists of the series and wonders why other villains refused to engage with Sailor Moon's speeches they way she did. Silverman concluded her review stating that Galaxia's overall character set up was one of the highlights of the season.

Intended as testbeds as the PRR began its electrification project, both locomotives remained service into the 1930s.  History  In the early 1900s, the Pennsylvania Railroad embarked on a major program to improve its access to New York City. The New York Tunnel Extension comprised tunnels and approaches from New Jersey and Long Island to Midtown Manhattan, leading to the PRR's massive new station, New York Penn Station. It was obvious that steam locomotives would be inappropriate for prolonged operation underground, so the PRR began experimenting with 600 V DC electrification, which had already been placed into operation elsewhere by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad. The Pennsylvania Railroad constructed the two locomotives in its Altoona Works as testbeds for larger locomotives to come. Both were of B-B wheel arrangement in the Association of American Railroads classification scheme; each had two trucks, each with two axles and four wheels. The first, 10001, used direct geared traction motors. The second, 10002, was built with motors mounted in the truck frames and geared to the wheels. Later on it was given one gearless truck. Both locomotives proved unstable at speed, pounding the track with high lateral forces. A competing experimental unit, \\"Odd D\\" #10003, of 4-4-0 wheel arrangement in Whyte notation or 2-B in the AAR scheme, proved much more stable. It was selected as the basis for the production model, which became the PRR DD1 twin-unit locomotive. At low speeds in switching service, however, the locomotives were acceptable. The first, #10001, was renumbered #3950 and was sold to the (PRR subsidiary) Long Island Rail Road in 1916. Numbered 323 on that road and nicknamed \\"Phoebe\\", the locomotive was in use until 1937 when it was scrapped. No. 10002, meanwhile, was renumbered #3951 and continued in service on the PRR.

This typically results in chest pain that is worse with breathing in. Bruising may occur at the site of the break. When several ribs are broken in several places a flail chest results. Potential complications include a pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and pneumonia. Rib fractures usually occur from a direct blow to the chest such as during a motor vehicle collision or from a crush injury. Coughing or metastatic cancer may also result in a broken rib. The middle ribs are most commonly fractured. Fractures of the first or second ribs are more likely to be associated with complications. Diagnosis can be made based on symptoms and supported by medical imaging. Pain control is an important part of treatment. This may include the use of paracetamol (acetaminophen), NSAIDs, or opioids. A nerve block may be another option. While fractured ribs have been wrapped, this may increase complications. In those with a flail chest, surgery may improve outcomes. They are a common injury following trauma. Signs and symptoms This typically results in chest pain that is worse with breathing in. Bruising may occur at the site of the break. =Complications= When several ribs are broken in several places a flail chest results. Potential complications include a pneumothorax, pulmonary contusion, and pneumonia. Causes Rib fractures can occur with or without direct trauma during recreational activity. Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) has also been known to cause thoracic injury, including but not limited to rib and sternum fractures. They can also occur as a consequence of diseases such as cancer or rheumatoid arthritis. While for elderly individuals a fall can cause a rib fracture, in adults automobile accidents are a common event for such an injury. Diagnosis Signs of a broken rib may include: * Pain on inhalation * Swelling in chest area * Bruise in chest area * Increasing shortness of breath * Coughing up blood (rib may have damaged lung) Plain X-rays often pick up displaced fractures but often miss undisplaced fractures. CT scanning is generally able to pick up both types of fractures. Because children have more flexible chest walls than adults do, their ribs are more likely to bend than to break; therefore the presence of rib fractures in children is evidence of a significant amount of force and may indicate severe thoracic injuries such as pulmonary contusion. Rib fractures are also a sign of more serious injury in elderly people. File:Rib fractures 2 -- Smart-Servier.pngIllustration showing rib fracture at 3rd, 4th and 5th rib. File:X-ray of rib fractures and pneumothorax.jpgRight sided pneumothorax and rib fractures File:BrokenRidCTParaSag.pngTwo broken ribs as seen on parasagittal CT Treatment There is no specific treatment for rib fractures, but various supportive measures can be taken. In simple rib fractures, pain can lead to reduced movement and cough suppression; this can contribute to formation of secondary chest infection. Flail chest is a potentially life-threatening injury and will often require a period of assisted ventilation. Flail chest and first rib fractures are high-energy injuries and should prompt investigation of damage to underlying viscera (e.g., lung contusion) or remotely (e.g., cervical spine injury). Spontaneous fractures in athletes generally require a cessation of the cause, e.g., time off rowing, while maintaining cardiovascular fitness. =Nerve blocks= Nerve blocks that may be used to help with pain related to rib fractures include epidural anesthesia, paravertebral block, erector spinae plane block and serratus anterior plane block.. There is very little evidence to support the use of one nerve block over another on the basis of analgesia or safety =Surgery= Treatment options for internal fixation/repair of rib fractures include: * Judet and/or sanchez plates/struts are a metal plate with strips that bend around the rib and then is further secured with sutures. * Synthes matrixrib fixation system has two options: a precontoured metal plate that uses screws to secure the plate to the rib; and/or an intramedullary splint which is tunneled into the rib and secured with a set screw. * Anterior locking plates are metal plates that have holes for screws throughout the plate. The plate is positioned over the rib and screwed into the bone at the desired position. The plates may be bent to match the contour of the section. * U-plates can also be used as they clamp on to the superior aspect of the ribs using locking screws.

It is composed of numerous Chinese myths relating to the creation of the world, containing accounts from the birth of Pangu till the historical era. It dates back to the Tang Dynasty of China. It was translated and published by Hu Chongjun after the discovery of a manuscript in 1982. Like the Homeric epics, the written poem was likely preceded by an oral tradition dating back to at least the Tang Dynasty. Wooden copies of Darkness are said to have survived to the Ming Dynasty but none have been found today. History The origin of Darkness dates back to the Tang Dynasty (618-907). At least eight manuscripts have survived today, most of which come from Shennongjia in China's Hubei Province. The tales told in the story have survived in the folk songs of the region. In August 1982, Hu Chongjun was given a songbook by an old local farmer. The booklet was written in brush and ink with about 3,000 lines of seven Chinese characters each. It was split into four sections: the beginnings of the Universe; the Birth of Pangu; the Great Flood; and the birth of mankind until the beginnings of the Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors. Hu began to study and gather the manuscripts from accounts of old people living in Shennongjia. Liu Shouhua, a professor at the Chinese Culture Department at the East China Normal University, read the ballad and believed that the Epic of Darkness may represent the Han Chinese creation myth that has been handed down in oral form.A Follow-up Study on the Legend of Darkness Yuan Ke, a scholar in Chinese mythology, carefully studied the original materials and supported Liu's suggestion that the Epic of Darkness is a folk epic. Yuan said that the discovery of \\"Darkness\\" could be regarded a historic event in the folklore history of the Han people. Yuan suggested some people should further study the different versions and rearrange with caution, the manuscripts into an integrated epic, without ruining its original flavor. Hu was chosen to compile this massive epic. It took him nine years to finally finish the collection. With 5,500 lines, the new edition was selected as the best of many different versions, compiled after Hu skimmed through more than 30,000 lines of the original manuscripts. Liu, who has read most of the original material, said, \\"So far, the content of this edition is the richest one. Compared with other versions, this edition is more beautiful and is in the linguistic style.\\" In the same year, the Beijing-based Hualian Publishing House bought the copyrights to publish the Epic of Darkness. But due to financial problems, publication of the book was delayed year after year. In 2000, Zhou Baiyi, publisher of the Changjiang Arts Publishing House, persuaded Hu to end his former contract with Hualian Publishing House and gave rights to his publishing house. Plot summary In the beginning, everything was a cloud of gas, chaos and darkness. After eons of effort, the first drop of water was created by a deity named Jiang Ku (). However a god named Lang Dang Zi () swallowed that drop of water and died. His body was split in five forms: Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth. From the elements was born Pan Gu who split the heavens and the earth before he eventually died and his body became the Earth. However mankind had yet to be created at this time. From the five elements and animals, were born demons and gods who fought each other until a great flood overcame the land. From this great flood, two dragons one black and one yellow fought a great battle. A goddess, Sacred Mother Wu Tien, helped the yellow dragon defeat the black dragon. In gratitude, the yellow dragon laid three eggs which the Sacred Mother swallowed and gave birth to three gods, Heaven, Earth and Hell. Later from the flood came five dragons who found a gourd in the Eastern sea. Wu Tien opened the Gourd and found two humans, Fuxi and N√ºwa, and told them to copulate and thus humans were born after the flood waters had receded.

The term mythopoetic was coined by professor Shepherd Bliss in preference to the term \\"New Age men's movement\\". Mythopoets adopted a general style of psychological self-help inspired by the work of Robert Bly, Robert A. Johnson, Joseph Campbell, and other Jungian authors. The group activities used in the movement were largely influenced by ideas derived from Jungian psychology, e.g., Jungian archetypes, from which the use of myths and fairy tales taken from various cultures served as ways to interpret challenges facing men in society. Groups formed during the mythopoetic men's movement typically avoided political and social advocacy in favor of therapeutic workshops and wilderness retreats, often performing Native American rituals such as drumming, chanting, and sweat lodges. These rituals were organized to facilitate the personal growth of participants (most often middle-class, middle-aged males) with an intended purpose of connecting spiritually with a lost deep masculine identity or inner self. The most well-known text of the movement was Iron John: A Book About Men by the poet Robert Bly, who argued that \\"male energy\\" had been diluted through modern social institutions such as the feminist movement, industrialization, and separation of fathers from family life through working outside the home. Bly urged men to recover a pre-industrial conception of masculinity through spiritual camaraderie with other men in male-only gatherings. The purpose of these activities was to foster greater understanding of the forces influencing the roles of men in modern society and how these changes affect behavior, self awareness, and identity. Sometimes mistakenly referred to simply as the men's movement, which is much broader, the mythopoetic movement is best known for the rituals that take place during their gatherings. While most in the public eye during the early 1990s, the movement carries on more quietly in The ManKind Project and independent psychologico-spiritual practitioners. Tenets and practices According to sociologist Michael Messner, mythopoets believe that the rise of the urban industrial society \\"trapped men into straitjackets of rationality, thus blunting the powerful emotional communion and collective spiritual transcendence that they believe men in tribal societies typically enjoyed\\". The movement seeks to restore the \\"deep masculine\\" to men who have lost it in their more modern lifestyles. Other causes claimed by advocates for the loss of the \\"deep masculine\\" include: * Men no longer being comrades who celebrated their masculinity together. Rather, they had become competitors within their workplaces. * Men spending more time in their houses with women than they did with men (in non-competitive terms outside of work). Excessive interaction with women generally kept men from realizing their internal masculinity. * Feminism bringing attention to the 'feminine voice.' Through this, the mythopoetic men felt that their voices had been muted (though Bly and others are careful in not blaming feminism for this). * The separation of men from their fathers kept them from being truly initiated into manhood, and was a source of emotional damage. * Men were suffering further emotional damage due to feminist accusations about sexism. Men should celebrate their differences from women, rather than feeling guilty about them. * Men being discouraged from expressing their emotions. Male inexpressivity is an epidemic and does not correspond to their \\"deep masculine\\" natures. The Fight in the Forest (Hans Burgkmair, ca. 1500/1503), illustrating the tale of Iron John Robert Bly The mythopoetic men's movement spawned a variety of self-help groups and workshops, led by authors such as Robert Bly, Michael J. Meade and Robert L. Moore. Among its most famous advocates was the poet Bly, whose book Iron John: A Book About Men (1990) spent 62 weeks on The New York Times Best Seller list, being an exegesis of the tale of \\"Iron John\\" collected by the Brothers Grimm. Groups of men from the professional class retreated from their female loved ones in order to join in spiritual rituals that emphasized homosociality, with the central goal of reclaiming the parts of their masculinity that they had lost called the \\"deep masculine.\\" In the mythopoetic movement, the desire to be spiritual and yet manly is also a factor in the way the group understands the nature of gender and relationships between the sexes. The mythopoetic movement tends to regard gender as biological realities, \\"hardwired\\" into the psyches of men and women. This gender essentialism is consistent with the Jungian philosophy undergirding the movement. Mythopoetic men thus speak of the need to recover \\"deep masculinity,\\" to distinguish what they regard as genuine or mature masculinity from the problematic toxic masculinity of immature males. Because most men no longer perform masculine rituals, mythopoets assert that men have mutated into destructive, hypermasculine chauvinists, or, in the opposite direction, have become too feminized. The mythopoetic men performed rituals at these gatherings, which were meant to imitate those performed by tribal societies when men initiated boys into a deeply essential natural manhood. The movement emphasized the importance of including multiple generations of men in the rituals, so that the men could learn about masculinity from those who were older and wiser. Author Michael Harner Characteristic of the early mythopoetic movement was a tendency to retell myths, legends and folktales, and engage in their exegesis as a tool for personal insight. Using frequent references to archetypes as drawn from Jungian analytical psychology, the movement focused on issues of gender role, gender identity and wellness for the modern man (and woman). Advocates would often engage in storytelling with music, these acts being seen as a modern extension to a form of \\"new age shamanism\\" popularized by Michael Harner at approximately the same time. The movement sought to empower men by means of equating archetypal characters with their own emotions and abilities. For instance, Michael Messner describes the concept of \\"Zeus energy\\" as emphasizing \\"male authority accepted for the good of the community\\". Beliefs about the emotional system based in archetypes of great men, mythopoets sought to channel these characters in themselves, so that they could unleash their \\"animal-males\\". This group primarily analyzed the archetypes of King, Warrior, Magician, Lover and Wildman. Some academic work came from the movement, as well as the creation of various magazines, continuing annual conferences based on Robert Bly's vision for creative communities such as Minnesota Men's Conference and the Great Mother and New Father Conference, and non-profit organizations doing related work like the ManKind Project and Micheal Meade's Mosaic Multicultural Foundation. Mythopoetic practices among women's groups and feminists were more commonly seen as part of a more general \\"women's spirituality\\". Politics As a self-help movement the mythopoetic movement tends not to take explicit stances on political issues such as feminism, gay rights or family law (such as the issues of divorce, domestic violence or child custody), preferring instead to stay focused on emotional and psychological well-being. Because of this neutrality, the movement became a target of social criticism by feminists, and was often characterized as anti- intellectual as well as apolitical. The sociologist Michael Messner once gave a speech at a gathering in which he addressed the dangers of celebrating the warrior, as instances of rape are higher in countries that glorify war. The mythopoets responded that they were not interested in intellectual or political pursuits, but were primarily concerned with conducting spiritual and emotional work.

Facing three seas, straddling important trade routes, Turkey has a complex, sophisticated culture, reflected in the variety of its dances. The dominant dance forms are types of line dance. There are many different types of folk dances performed in various ways in Turkey, and these reflect the cultural structure of each region. The Bar in Erzurum province, the Halay in the East and Southeast, the Hora in Thrace, the Horon in the Black Sea, Spoon dances in and around Konya and Lezginka in Kars and Ardahan are the best known examples of these. Types of dance thumb350pxTurkish dance regions: Hora - East Thrace Zeybek - Aegean, Southern Marmara and Middle-eastern Anatolia Region Teke - Western Mediterranean Region Ka≈üƒ±k Havasƒ± and Kar≈üƒ±lama - Western Central Anatolia, Western Black Sea, Southern Marmara, Eastern Mediterranean Region Horon - Central and Eastern Black Sea Region Halay - Eastern Anatolia and Central Anatolia Region Bar and Lezginka - Northeastern Anatolia Region =Bar= With their structure and formation, they are the dances performed by groups in the open. They are spread, in general, over the eastern part of Anatolia (Erzurum, Bayburt, Agri, Kars, Artvin and Erzincan provinces). The characteristic of their formation is that they are performed side-by-side, hand, shoulder and arm-in-arm. Woman and man bars are different from one another. The principal instruments of our bar dances are davul and zurna (shrill pipe). Later, clarinet has been added to the woman bars. The dominant measures in bars are 5/8 and 9/8. Occasionally measures of 6/8 and 12/8 are used. Aksak 9/8 measures which are also the most characteristic measures, in particular, of the Turkish folk music are applied with extremely different and interesting structures in this dance. They normally wear costumes as they dance. They always dance with pride and they turn their hands as they hop dance. =Halay= This folk-dance, is a part of Turkish dance and is performed to a large extent in the Eastern, South- Eastern and Central Anatolia and it is one of the most striking dance. It has a rich figure structure of simplicity is the symbol of creation and originality of the folk. The rhythmic elements of halay dances are very rich and are mostly performed with drum-zurna combination as well as with kaval (shepherd's pipe), sipsi (reed), cigirtma (fife) or baglama (an instrument with three double strings played with a plectrum) or performed when folk songs are sung. =Horon= The horon (Greek: Horos [masculine noun, singular form, nominative]), which derives from the Greek word: choros () meaning dance in both ancient and modern Greek, Turkish: Horon, is a dance style found in the Black Sea region, now modern Turkey. The dances called Horon derived from the Greek culture of the area and are circular in nature, each characterized by distinct short steps. HORON or the round dance is a typical folk dance of the Black Sea coastal area and its interior parts. Horons appear very different from the folk dances in other parts of the country with their formation of tempo, rhythm and measure. Horons are performed, in general, by groups and their characteristic measure is 7/16 For their melodies are rendered very fast, it is very difficult to render them with every instrument. For this reason, rendering with a drum and zurna becomes practical. Melodies of horon are performed with the small type of zurna which is called 'cura'. In addition, in the interior parts blowing instruments such as bagpipe mey (again, a small zurna) etc. The other measures used are 2/4, 5/8 and 9/16. =Zeybek= Zeybeks are, in general, the widespread folk dances of the Western Anatolia. It is rendered by one person or two or by a group of people and its name changes for example as 'seymen' in the central parts of Anatolia. Zeybek dances are formed, in general, of 9/8 measures and have a variety of tempos such as very slow, slow, fast and very fast. Very slow zeybek dances have the measure of 9/2, slow ones 9/4 and some others 9/8. Very fast dances, for instance, teke (goat) dance seen in Burdur ‚Äì Fethiye region can be regarded as dances of zeybek character, they have the traditional measure of 9/16 There is another folk dance named as BENGI in the zeybek region. It is performed more differently from the zeybek and has got a different musical feature and the most characteristic measure of bengi dance is 9/8. Particularly in slow zeybeks, the traditional instruments is drum- zurna combination. The use of 2 drums and 2 zurnas in combination is a tradition, function of one of the zurnas is accompaniment, in other words, it accompanies the melody with a second constant tune. Apart from drum-zurna, a three-double string instrument baglama, reed, marrow bow etc. are used for fast zeybek dances. In particular, the traditional instrument of the teke (goat) dance region is reed. =Other forms= Children from Turkey perform folk dance * Karsilamas: (a kind of wedding music) and hora (from ancient Greek art form of œáŒøœÅŒµŒØŒ±) type folk dances with melodic and rhythmic structure and with a fast performance facing one another and different cultural structure of the region and the dominant measure is 9/8 but some other measures are used as well. Their traditional instrument are 2 drum - 2 zurna combination, the most characteristic use of this combination is seen in this region. It can be found also as, Tsifteteli. * Kasap havasi/Hasapiko: meaning \\"the butcher's dance\\" from \\"butcher\\", is a modern dance from ƒ∞stanbul and East Thrace.http://www.turkuler.com/nota/ezgi_trakya_kasap_havasi.html The dance has its origins in Byzantine times by butchers, taken by the Byzantine military.sword dance in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica.

They are always rendered with wooden- spoons and the characteristic measure is 2/4 or 4/4. The instruments used are beast bow (later violin), baglama and clarinet, in general, they are accompanied by folk songs.

These patients are conscious and breathing and will often have only relatively minor injuries; thus they are capable of walking. Depending on the resources available, and the abilities of the injured persons, walking wounded may sometimes be called upon to assist treatment of more seriously injured patients or assist with other tasks. In most mass casualty situations, the walking wounded are the largest category of casualty. Classification According to Simple Triage and Rapid Treatment (START) documentation, walking wounded are determined by requesting those on the scene who may self-evacuate, to do so immediately to a designated refuge. Any casualties able to respond to this command and move themselves to the designated position are considered walking wounded. According to the Revised Trauma Score (RTS) system of triaging, walking wounded can be considered to be those scoring a 12.

They were constructed with bipolar devices, in a bit-slice topology, and were designed to be used as modular components each representing a different aspect of a computer control unit (CCU). By using the bit slicing technique, Am2900 family was able to implement a CCU with data, addresses, and instructions to be any multiple of 4 bits by multiplying the number of ICs. One major problem with this modular technique was that it required a larger number of ICs to implement what could be done on a single CPU IC. The Am2901 chip was the arithmetic-logic unit (ALU), and the \\"core\\" of the series. It could count using 4 bits and implement binary operations as well as various bit-shifting operations. The 2901 and some other chips in the family were second sourced by an unusually large number of other manufacturers, starting with Motorola and then Raytheon both in 1975 and also Cypress Semiconductor, National Semiconductor, NEC, Thomson, and Signetics. In the Soviet Union and later Russia the Am2900 family was manufactured as the 1804 series (with e.g. the Am2901 designated as KR1804VS1 / ) which was still in production as of 2016.  Computers made with Am2900-family chips  There are probably many more, but here are some known machines using these parts: * The Apollo Computer Tern family: DN460, DN660 and DSP160. All used the same system board emulating the Mc68010 instruction set. * The Itek Advanced Technology Airborne Computer (ATAC) used on the Galileo Attitude and Articulation Control Computer System and some Navy aircraft had a 16-register, 16-bit word width assembled from 4-bit-wide 2900 series processors. Four special instructions were added to the Galileo version of the ATAC, and later some chips were replaced with radiation-hardened 2901 chips. * Data General Nova 4, which obtained 16-bit word width using four Am2901 ALUs in parallel; one of the boards had 15 Am2901 ALUs on it. * Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) PDP-11 models PDP-11/23, PDP-11/34, and PDP-11/44 floating-point options (FPF11, FP11-A and FP11-F, respectively). * The DEC VAX 11/730, which used eight AM2901s for the CPU. *Hewlett-Packard (now Keysight) 1000 A-series model A600 used four AM2901 ALUs for its 16-bit processor * The Xerox Dandelion, the machine used in the Xerox Star and Xerox 1108 Lisp machine. * Several models of the GEC 4000 series minicomputers: 4060, 4150, 4160 (four Am2901 each, 16-bit ALU), and 4090 and all 418x and 419x systems (eighteen Am2901 each, 32-bit integer ALU or 8-bit exponent, 64-bit Double Precision floating point ALU). * The DEC KS10 PDP-10 model. * The UCSD Pascal P-machine processor designed at NCR by Joel McCormack. * A number of MAI Basic Four machines. * The Tektronix 4052 graphics system computer. * The SM-1420, Soviet clone of PDP-11, used Soviet clone of AM2901 perhaps also used in others. * The Lilith computer designed at ETH Z√ºrich by Niklaus Wirth. * Atari's vector graphics arcade machines Tempest, Battlezone, and Red Baron each used 4 Am2901 ICs in their \\"math box\\" auxiliary circuit boards. * Atari's raster graphics arcade machine I, Robot, the first commercial game featuring filled polygons, included a math processor built around four AMD 2901 chips. * Pixar Image Computer, 4 Channel Processors each with 4 Am2900's * Simulation Excel (Sim-X), Oslo, Norway: Typographical workstation / typesetter; one of its four processors was a 16-bit microcoded calculation and transformation engine built from four 2901 slices and one 2910 address sequencer. The Sim-X machine used a 16-bit integer multiplier to optimize graphical transformations. The machine debuted in 1983 and the company shut down in 1987. * Eventide H949 Harmonizer; four Am2901 chips (and several microcode PROMs) are used to generate addresses and generate reference voltages for the DAC system audio was not processed in the 2901 ALU section. * Many Siemens Teleperm and S5 PLCs used for industrial control were built using the 2900 series. * AT&T; 3B20D processor. * Metheus / Barco Omega 400 and 500 Series graphics systems; four Am2901 chips (and eight microcode PROMs) were used to perform graphics operations on this 1982 display processor. * Geac Computer Corporation 2000, 6000, 8000, and 9000 were all based on 4 x AM2901 chips. The GEAC 9500 was based on the AM29101. The GEAC 2000 was used in pharmacies. The other models were used in library, banking, and insurance automation. The 2000 was a single processor unit. The 6000 and 8000 contained four processors, each dedicated to one of comms, disk, tape, or program processing. The 8000 had local processor memory whereas the 6000 did not. The 9000 and 9500 were AMP systems with up to 8 CPU modules. * AES Data Systems C20 Multiuser Word Processors. AES of Montreal designed a series of modules and systems based on their AES-800 bit-slice processors. 8- 12- and 16-bit buses were part of the design. * Later iterations of the Ferranti Argus 700 e.g. the 700F and 700G, used AM2901 devices, as did as some of the A700 peripheral channel controllers for e.g. hard and floppy disc drives * The High Level Hardware Limited Orion, a user-microcodable minicomputer running Unix.http://hlhco.info/OrionBrochure.pdf  Members of the Am2900 family  AMD Am2903: 4-bit-slice ALU The Am2900 Family Data Book lists: *Am2901 ‚Äì 4-bit bit-slice ALU (1975) *Am2902 ‚Äì Look-Ahead Carry Generator *Am2903 ‚Äì 4-bit- slice ALU, with hardware multiply *Am2904 ‚Äì Status and Shift Control Unit *Am2905 ‚Äì Bus Transceiver *Am2906 ‚Äì Bus Transceiver with Parity *Am2907 ‚Äì Bus Transceiver with Parity *Am2908 ‚Äì Bus Transceiver with Parity *Am2909 ‚Äì 4-bit- slice address sequencer *Am2910 ‚Äì 12-bit address sequencer *Am2911 ‚Äì 4-bit- slice address sequencer *Am2912 ‚Äì Bus Transceiver *Am2913 ‚Äì Priority Interrupt Expander *Am2914 ‚Äì Priority Interrupt Controller *Am2915 ‚Äì Quad 3-State Bus Transceiver *Am2916 ‚Äì Quad 3-State Bus Transceiver *Am2917 ‚Äì Quad 3-State Bus Transceiver *Am2918 ‚Äì Instruction Register, Quad D Register *Am2919 ‚Äì Instruction Register, Quad Register *Am2920 ‚Äì Octal D-Type Flip-Flop *Am2921 ‚Äì 1-to-8 Decoder *Am2922 ‚Äì 8-Input Multiplexer (MUX) *Am2923 ‚Äì 8-Input MUX *Am2924 ‚Äì 3-Line to 8-Line Decoder *Am2925 ‚Äì System Clock Generator and Driver *Am2926 ‚Äì Schottky 3-State Quad Bus Driver *Am2927/Am2928 ‚Äì Quad 3-State Bus Transceiver *Am2929 ‚Äì Schottky 3-State Quad Bus Driver *Am2930 ‚Äì Main Memory Program Control *Am2932 ‚Äì Main Memory Program Control *Am2940 ‚Äì Direct Memory Addressing (DMA) Generator *Am2942 ‚Äì Programmable Timer/Counter/DMA Generator *Am2946/Am2947 ‚Äì Octal 3-State Bidirectional Bus Transceiver *Am2948/Am2949 ‚Äì Octal 3-State Bidirectional Bus Transceiver *Am2950/Am2951 ‚Äì 8-bit Bidirectional I/O Ports *Am2954/Am2955 ‚Äì Octal Registers *Am2956/Am2957 ‚Äì Octal Latches *Am2958/Am2959 ‚Äì Octal Buffers/Line Drivers/Line Receivers *Am2960 ‚Äì Cascadable 16-bit Error Detection and Correction Unit *Am2961/Am2962 ‚Äì 4-bit Error Correction Multiple Bus Buffers *Am2964 ‚Äì Dynamic Memory Controller *Am2965/Am2966 ‚Äì Octal Dynamic Memory Driver Many of these chips also have 7400 series numbers such as the 74F2960 / Am2960.

The meringue is prepared from whipped egg whites, sugar, and vanilla extract and baked in a bain-marie. The cr√®me anglaise is prepared with the egg yolks, vanilla, and hot milk, briefly cooked. Terminology There is some confusion about the name. Oeufs √† la neige (\\"eggs in snow\\") is often confused with the Floating Island but they are not the same dessert; the former is made with smaller pieces of poached meringue while the Floating Island is made with one larger piece of meringue that is baked in a bain-marie. History The earliest known English language references to the dessert have been traced to the Thirteen Colonies of the United States, in a 1771 letter from Benjamin Franklin reporting \\"At dinner had a floating island\\". An 1847 American cookbook lists floating island as a Fourth of July celebration dessert. The historical form of the dessert was quite different in England than in France, where it was known as Ile Flotante. Some scholars say that today's \\"Floating Island\\" more closely resembles the 18th century French Ile Floatante than the elaborate cake and jelly constructions of English cuisine, while others say that the early French versions were not made with meringue at all, but layers of liquor soaked spongecake or brioche served in custard sauce (or berry puree). Elizabeth Raffald's 18th century recipe published in the The Experienced English Housekeeper seeks to create a pastoral winter landscape: > \\"beat the white of an egg to a strong froth, and roll a sprig of myrtle in > it to imitate snow ... let it stand till it is quite cold and stiff, then > lay on rock candied-sweetmeats upon the top of your jelly, and sheep and > swans to pick at the myrtle; stick green sprigs in two or three places on > top of your jelly, amongst your shapes\\". Hannah Glasse is noted for a similar \\"pretty Middle Dish\\" that she suggests for a \\"second course at a Grand Table or a Wedding Supper\\" resembling \\"a floating island, set round with candles like a Christmas Tree.\\" It is made with sweetened thick cream, sack and lemon peel whipped into a froth, then layered with thin slices of bread alternating with jelly, piled high with the stiffened froth. Fruits and sweetmeats are arranged in a ring around the edge of the dish that is presented as a centerpiece for the table with candles all around it. According to Larousse Gastronomique the dessert was served a little less by the time the encyclopedia was published in 1938, and its writers expressed regret because the dish is \\"excellent\\" . The version recorded in the Larousse Gastronomique was made with stale Savoy biscuits sliced thin and soaked in kirsch and maraschino layered with apricot marmalade and a garnish of chopped almonds and currants. The layers were assembled to form a type of cake that was frosted with chantilly cream, with either custard or berry puree poured over the whole thing. Preparation Cr√®me anglaise, the base of floating island Floating island consists of a meringue served floating on a milky custard sauce. Some variations use a thicker sauce, served on top of the dumplings, but usually the custard is thin and the dumplings \\"float\\" on top. First, the custard made of milk, sugar, vanilla, and egg yolks is briefly cooked in a bain-marie. The custard should be thick enough to coat a spoon. To make the meringue, the egg whites are beaten with sugar and poured into a mold that may be lined with caramelised sugar. It is then steamed in the oven in a bain-marie. Once the meringue is cooked and chilled, the sauce is poured on a serving plate and the unmolded meringue placed on the sauce to \\"float\\". The result can be served at room temperature or chilled.

Marian Ilitch and three daughters are among only 12 women to have had their names engraved on the trophy. Mike Ilitch's Detroit Tigers, a baseball team, logged losing records in 12 out of 13 seasons but turned the team around in 2006. They made the playoffs for the first time since 1987.

The $300 million plus Comerica Park opened in April 2000. Ilitch Holdings, Inc. manages the stadium and parking.  Investing in the community  The MotorCity Casino contributed about $1 million to local charity groups in Detroit. In 1985, Ilitch and her husband established the Little Caesars Love Kitchen Foundation, which consists of a mobile pizza restaurant. The Love Kitchen has fed more than 2 million people, aiding the hungry and disaster victims across the U.S. and Canada. Three presidents, President Ronald Reagan, President George Bush Sr, and President Bill Clinton have recognized the work of the Love Kitchen. Besides donating millions of dollars to charitable organizations, Ilitch and her husband have established Ilitch Charities for Children, a non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of children in the areas of health, education, and recreation.

Over the stage, a Don Carlos Dubois and Wilbur Kurtz mural contains scenes from Macon area history from the Spanish explorations of Hernando de Soto to the early twentieth century. Though it is significantly older than, and geographically separate from, the other building in the complex, the Auditorium is maintained as part of the Macon Centreplex, which also includes the Macon Coliseum. The latter two facilities comprise a single building on the east side of the Ocmulgee River, and for many in the general public, \\"the Centreplex\\" refers specifically to that property, while the downtown structure continues to be colloquially known simply as \\"the Auditorium\\".

Early Life and Career Goto was born into a Christian family in Hakodate, Hokkaido. Raised Russian Orthodox, his mother spoke to him often about Biblical prophecy. Stories of Armageddon had been handed down from his grandmother, who was one of the first believers in Japan through the missionary work conducted by Saint Nicholas. Early in his career, Got≈ç published works dealing with issues of the Second World War as well as several books supportive of S≈çka Gakkai and its controversial leader, Daisaku Ikeda. In 1969, while working as a freelance writer for various women‚Äôs magazines, his interest in Nostradamus was piqued while watching the Apollo moon landing. He recalled having read about such an event in Nostradamus‚Äô quatrains. In 1973, he published a book named \\"„Éé„Çπ„Éà„É©„ÉÄ„É†„Çπ„ÅÆÂ§ß‰∫àË®Ä\\" (Nostradamus no daiyogen; \\"The Prophecies of Nostradamus\\"), which introduced Nostradamus and his prophecies to a mainstream Japanese audience. A film version was released in 1974. The Prophecies of Nostradamus His writings were described as tapping into Japan‚Äôs deep insecurity and vulnerability about living in a troubled world. He focused particularly on a quatrain appearing to predict a catastrophe occurring in 1999. Books on prophecy sold well in Japan at that time. Common themes included oil shock, dollar devaluation, the stock-market collapse, the rise and fall of real- estate prices in Tokyo, a trade war with America, volcanic eruptions and the threat of catastrophic earthquakes. The work became a runaway bestseller and sparked a ‚ÄúNostradamus boom‚Äù in Japanese publishing. On November 5, 1991, Goto published Predictions of Nostradamus: Middle-East Chapter, a description of how Nostradamus‚Äô quatrains pointed to a war in the Middle East. This was his seventh book on the subject, and sold 400,000 copies in 6 months. By 1991, the combined total of his Nostradamus output had sold 5.4 million copies.(4) Quotations ‚ÄúI wanted to warn people.

The project was founded in May 2005 by the Brain and Mind Institute of √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) in Switzerland. Its mission is to use biologically-detailed digital reconstructions and simulations of the mammalian brain to identify the fundamental principles of brain structure and function. The project is headed by the founding director Henry Markram‚Äîwho also launched the European Human Brain Project‚Äîand is co-directed by Felix Sch√ºrmann and Sean Hill. Using a Blue Gene supercomputer running Michael Hines's NEURON software, the simulation involves a biologically realistic model of neuronsGraham-Rowe, Duncan. \\"Mission to build a simulated brain begins\\", NewScientist, June 2005.Palmer, Jason. Simulated brain closer to thought, BBC News. and an empirically reconstructed model connectome. It is hoped that it will eventually shed light on the nature of consciousness. There are a number of sub-projects, including the Cajal Blue Brain, which is coordinated by the Supercomputing and Visualization Center of Madrid (CeSViMa), and others run by universities and independent laboratories. Goal The initial goal of the project, which was completed in December 2006, was the creation of a simulated rat neocortical column, which is considered by some researchers to be the smallest functional unit of the neocortex, which is thought to be responsible for higher functions such as conscious thought. In humans, each column is about in length, has a diameter of and contains about 60,000 neurons. Rat neocortical columns are very similar in structure but contain only 10,000 neurons and 108 synapses. Between 1995 and 2005, Markram mapped the types of neurons and their connections in such a column. Progress By 2005, the first cellular model was completed. The first artificial cellular neocortical column of 10,000 cells was built by 2008. By July 2011, a cellular mesocircuit of 100 neocortical columns with a million cells in total was built. A cellular rat brain had been planned for 2014 with 100 mesocircuits totalling a hundred million cells. A cellular human brain equivalent to 1,000 rat brains with a total of a hundred billion cells has been predicted to be possible by 2023. In 2005, the project was publishing its initial results in scientific literature and aiming to construct a simulation on the molecular level, which will allow studying the effects of gene expression. It also aimed to simplify the column simulation to allow parallel simulation of large numbers of connected columns with the ultimate goal of simulating a whole neocortex, which in humans consists of about a million cortical columns. In November 2007, the project reported the end of the first phase, delivering a data-driven process for creating, validating, and researching the neocortical column. In 2015, scientists at √âcole Polytechnique F√©d√©rale de Lausanne (EPFL) developed a quantitative model of the previously unknown relationship between the glial cell astrocytes and neurons. This model describes the energy management of the brain through the function of the neuro-glial vascular unit (NGV). The additional layer of neuron-glial cells is being added to Blue Brain Project models to improve functionality of the system. In 2017, Blue Brain Project discovered that neural cliques connected to one another in up to eleven dimensions. The project's director suggested that the difficulty of understanding the brain is partly because the mathematics usually applied for studying networks cannot detect that many dimensions. The Blue Brain Project was able to model these networks using algebraic topology.\\"Blue Brain Team Discovers a Multi-Dimensional Universe in Brain Networks\\". Frontiers Science News, June 12, 2017. In 2018, Blue Brain Project released its first digital 3D brain cell atlas which, according to ScienceDaily, is like \\"going from hand- drawn maps to Google Earth\\", providing information about major cell types, numbers, and positions in 737 regions of the brain. In 2019, Idan Segev, one of the computational neuroscientists working on the Blue Brain Project, gave a talk titled: \\"Brain in the computer: what did I learn from simulating the brain.\\" In his talk, he mentioned that the whole cortex for the mouse brain was complete and virtual EEG experiments would begin soon. He also mentioned that the model had become too heavy on the supercomputers they were using at the time, and that they were consequently exploring methods in which every neuron could be represented as a neural network (see citation for details).https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sEiDxti0opE Funding The project is funded primarily by the Swiss government and the Future and Emerging Technologies (FET) Flagship grant from the European Commission, and secondarily by grants and donations from private individuals. The EPFL bought the Blue Gene computer at a reduced cost because it was still a prototype and IBM was interested in exploring how applications would perform on the machine. BBP was viewed as a validation of the Blue Gene supercomputer concept.

According to The New York Times, George was \\"a consummate spymaster who moved the chess pieces in the CIA‚Äôs clandestine games of intrigue\\". After serving in Korea and Japan as an enlisted man in Army Intelligence, George was one of the CIA‚Äôs earliest recruits. As such George challenged the traditional image of early CIA recruits. He was not a son of privilege and lacked an Ivy League pedigree. By many accounts, he developed a loyal following for his ebullient manner and courage working in some of the world‚Äôs most volatile regions. After a highly decorated career lasting nearly thirty years, including dangerous assignments in Beirut and Athens, George served for three years in the Reagan Administration as Deputy Director for Operations. He was the third-ranking official at the CIA under William Casey. George made headlines when he became the highest-ranking target of investigation and prosecution in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. After a first mistrial, George was eventually found guilty by a jury on only two counts of false statements to congressional committees investigating the Iran-Contra Affair. He was pardoned by President George H. W. Bush two weeks later along with others involved. The special prosecutor immediately thereafter moved to vacate the indictments against George altogether. In 1996, one of the laws used against George was held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unrelated case.Hubbard v United States After his retirement from the CIA, George continued to hold legendary hero status in the intelligence community and he was a successful consultant on international matters. He also volunteered nightly for the Suicide Hotline under the code name \\"Charlie.\\" He died in Bethesda at age 81 of cardiac arrest. His wife of 45 years, Mary Atkinson George, had died in 2008.Obituary of wife Mary George She had given up her CIA career when they married but became the grand dame who would come to guide a generation of CIA wives and mothers in leading difficult and dangerous lives. They were survived by two daughters and by three grandchildren to whom they were devoted. Clair and Mary George are buried together at Arlington National Cemetery. Early life Clair Elroy George was born Aug. 3, 1930 in Pittsburgh. His family moved several times, ending up in the western Pennsylvania steel-mill town of Beaver Falls, Pa., when he was 9. His father was a dairy chemist who worked for the United States Department of Agriculture. George, nicknamed ‚ÄúRed‚Äù because of his hair color, was an academic standout, a musician (drummer) and president of the student council. He worked in a steel mill. Later he majored in political science and debated at Pennsylvania State University, graduating in 1952. He was set to enroll in Columbia Law School when he joined the Army instead in the midst of the Korean War. He learned Chinese and worked in counterintelligence. He joined the CIA after being impressed by agency officers he met in the Far East. In 1960, George married a CIA secretary, Mary Atkinson; she died in 2008. They had two daughters both born in Paris while George was assigned to Bamako, Mali. Long CIA service As the CIA‚Äôs deputy director of operations for three years of the Reagan administration, the third-highest post in the spy agency, George was responsible for cloak-and- dagger activities worldwide. He reached this pinnacle after three decades of working as a spy around the world, specializing in recruiting foreign agents to spy on their own countries for the United States. After the Korean War, George joined the CIA in 1955. Through cunning and mettle, he advanced through the ranks of the clandestine service, working in Cold War proxy zones in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and Europe. He went from Hong Kong to Paris, from Mali to New Delhi. The Washington Post Magazine in 1992 quoted a colleague as calling George ‚Äúa top-notch street man‚Äù who operated in what spies call the ‚Äúnight soil circuit‚Äù‚Äîthe less desirable posts of the world. George served as the CIA‚Äôs station chief in Beirut when civil war erupted there in 1975. His successor would be kidnapped and assassinated. The following year he volunteered to replace the Athens station chief, who had just been assassinated by the Revolutionary Organization 17 November for the alleged CIA support of the Regime of the Colonels. This gesture, perhaps more than anything, brought him recognition as a dedicated officer willing to make his safety secondary to the needs of the agency. George returned permanently to Washington in 1979. He placed first out of 100 candidates in a promotions ranking and was put in charge of the agency‚Äôs African division. William J. Casey, whom Reagan had named director of central intelligence, appointed George to successively higher positions, among them as the CIA‚Äôs liaison to Congress. He served later as deputy director from 1984 until his retirement in 1987. Distinctions and medals George was the recipient of three Distinguished Intelligence Medals from 1983 to 1988 and was awarded the Intelligence Medal of Merit. Iran-Contra Affair George was the highest- ranking CIA official to stand trial over the biggest White House scandal since Watergate: a White House-led operation to covertly sell weapons to Iran and divert the profits to right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras. The operation had been engineered out of the White House by Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North, who served on the National Security Council staff. North was then aided by CIA Director William Casey. Aspects of the operation violated a congressionally-mandated restriction of overt U.S. support of the Contras. George initially told Congress that CIA was not involved in the operation, and he later apologized for being evasive. He said he was trying to protect the agency. George would later explain that he had reservations about the operation all along but said he did not push hard enough to stop it outright. \\"At no time‚Äîwhich maybe I should have‚Äîdid I dash into the director‚Äôs office and say, ‚ÄòHey, Bill, we have got to stop all this stuff,‚Äô\\" George testified before Congress in 1987, to the Congressional committees investigating the Iran‚ÄìContra affair. Called in front of to Congress in 1987, George said he‚Äôd been \\"almost megalomaniacal in trying to prove one thing: that we were not involved in that activity because it would have been illegal.\\" Motivated by loyalty to CIA, he said he had not answered as fully as he might have. He said he had \\"perceived my charter too small\\" when initially speaking before Congress, but he added, \\"I don‚Äôt lie, and I did not mean to lie.\\" Casey died in May 1987. FBI Director William Webster took over CIA with a mandate to clean house. That December, George was asked to retire. In September 1991, George was indicted on 9 counts, including making false statements to Congress. After the first court case ended in a mistrial, George was retried in the fall of 1992 on seven counts, resulting in being found guilty on two charges of false statements to Congressional staff. However, despite years of negligent reporting, George was never \\"convicted\\" because he was never sentenced. Before George was sentenced, President Bush pardoned him on December 24, 1992. On Christmas Eve, President George H. W. Bush pardoned George and several other former administration officials, including former defense secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. The special prosecutor immediately thereafter moved to vacate the indictments against George altogether. In 1996, the federal statute under which George was found guilty was held unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court in an unrelated case. At the end, George was found guilty but pardoned under an indictment that was vacated and a law that was eventually held unconstitutional. Notably, he had been found guiltless on several other counts, notwithstanding Senators' wild allegations. Amid the Iran-contra investigations, George seemed to take the long view of a seasoned operative who knew the nature of politics and spycraft‚Äîand their shadowy nexus. He told congressional Iran-Contra investigators in 1987: \\"This is not the first administration and will not be the last that becomes totally frustrated with its spy service.\\" See also *List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States References External links * Article about Jan Pottker events * Article about animal rights activists * Contemporaneous article about Clair George's 10-count felony indictment * Obituary of Mary George, Clair George's wife Category:1930 births Category:2011 deaths Category:American spies Category:Iran‚ÄìContra affair Category:People of the Central Intelligence Agency Category:Recipients of American presidential pardons Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Intelligence Medal ","title":"Clair George"},{"id":"3634272","text":"XSI may refer to: * Softimage XSI, a high-end three-dimensional (3D) graphics application * South Indian Lake Airport, the IATA code for the airport in Canada * Canon EOS 450D, known as EOS Rebel XSi in North America, a DSLR camera from Canon * X/Open System Interfaces Extension, a supplementary specification to the Single UNIX Specification * A conventional XML namespace prefix for XML Schema instance information * Broadsoft Xtended Services Interface, a set of APIs for integrating BroadWorks functions with Internet services * XS International, a networking solutions provider ","title":"XSI"},{"id":"3634275","text":"The Yinggarda language (also written Yingkarta and Inggarda) is an Australian Aboriginal language.

They live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the coastal and rainforest environments of the islands and are also one of the oldest tribes in Indonesia. The Mentawai population is estimated to be about 64,000. The Mentawai tribe is documented to have migrated from Nias ‚Äì a northern island ‚Äì to the Mentawai islands, living in an isolated life for centuries until they were discovered in 1621 by the Dutch. The ancestors of the indigenous Mentawai people are believed to have first migrated to the region somewhere between 2000 to 500 BCE. The Mentawai language belongs to the Austronesian language family. Additionally, Mentawai people call their homeland Bumi Sikerei. They follow their own animist belief system called Arat Sabulungan, that links the supernatural powers of ancestral spirits to the ecology of the rainforest. When the spirits are not treated well or forgotten, they might bring bad luck like illnesses and haunt those who forgot them. Mentawai also have very strong belief towards objects they think are holy. The people are characterized by their heavy spirituality, body art and their tendency to sharpen their teeth, a practice they feel makes one beautiful. Mentawai tend to live in unison and peace with the nature around them because they believe that all things in nature have some kind of spiritual essence.  Culture and lifestyle  An Uma, the traditional communal house of the Mentawai A Mentawai woman, 2017 The Mentawai live in the traditional dwelling called the Uma which is a longhouse and is made by weaving bamboo strips together to make walls and thatching the roofs with grass, the floor is raised on stilts and is made of wood planks. Each Uma is decorated with skulls of the various animals they hunted. An Uma can house three to four families. A Lalep is a smaller house containing only one family; and a Rusuk is a home for widows and bachelors. The main clothing for men is a loin cloth made from the bark of a gum tree. Mentawai adorn themselves with necklaces and flowers in their hair and ears. Women wear a cloth wound around the waist and small sleeveless vests made from palm or banana leaves. Mentawai sharpen their teeth with a chisel for aesthetic reasons. It is very common to see Mentawai people covered head to toe in tattoos, since they follow various traditional tribal rituals and their tattoos identify their role and social status. The tradition of tattooing called Titi, is done with cane and coconut charcoal dye, a nail, a needle, and two pieces of wood fashioned into a hammer-like stick by a shaman called Sikerei. The shaman will pray for the charcoal before using it to make a tattoo. Tattooing on the island is an identity and a personal or communal reflection of the people's relationship to nature, called Arat Sabulungan, although there are motivational and design differences from region to region and among clans. Mentawai people believe that these tattoos allow them to bring their material wealth into the afterlife and allows their ancestors to recognize them in the afterlife. Moreover, Mentawai tattoos are considered as one of the oldest in the world, and symbolize the balance between foresters and nature. The Mentawai, also known as the \\"Flower People\\", never harvest a plant or take the life of an animal without asking for their spirit's forgiveness first because they believe every part of the environment has a spirit. This belief is essential to their traditional religion of Arat Sabulungan. This complex cultural belief system gives reverence to the spirits of their ancestors, the sky, land, ocean, rivers, and all that is natural within. It also provides local people with the skills, knowledge, and values required to maintain a self-sufficient and sustainable lifestyle. As teachers, healers and caretakers of this indigenous knowledge, local shaman, known as Sikerei, fulfill their responsibility to the wider community by educating them in the intricacies of Arat Sabulungan. They instill a comprehensive understanding of all that life is dependent upon within their people. Sikerei are the backbone of Mentawai culture and its sustainability. Presently, largely due to the gradual introduction and influence of foreign cultural, behavioral and ideological change, the number of Sikerei still practicing the Arat Sabulungan lifestyle and their role has diminished to a few small clans located in the south of Siberut island. The traditional knife of the Mentawai people is called Palitai, while their traditional shield is called Kurabit. Men hunt warthogs, chicken, deer, and primates. Dogs are usually used to spot the animals during hunting, then the prey is shot with a bow and poisonous arrow. The poison comes from a local leaf which has been mashed and mixed with water. Women and children gather wild yams and other wild food and fruits. The main food they eat is sago, a type of flour from ground palm medulla, which is usually grilled. Small animals are hunted by women. The Mentawai people keep pigs, dogs, monkeys, and sometimes chickens as pets. During the pre- independence era, the cultural influence of foreign colonials and other islanders had systematically displaced or obliterated indigenous customs and religions. In postcolonial times, the Indonesian government continued this policy with a 1954 decree that prohibited animist religions, effectively abolishing tattooing and other customs. In the 1950s, the government began introducing development programs designed to integrate the Mentawai into mainstream society. While this policy may have sought to encourage social unification, in practice, it resulted in the suppression of the Mentawai‚Äôs Arat Sabulungan. In extreme cases, state policy led to the burning and destruction of cultural paraphernalia used for ritual and ceremonial purposes. Moreover, Mentawai shamans, the Sikerei, were forcibly imprisoned or disrobed and removed from the forest. Prahus of Mentawai islander. Due to modernization, the Mentawai people have experienced some significant change in their day to day lives and culture. With the introduction of Pancasila and transmigration, the majority of the Mentawai increasingly lost connection with their ancestral ways. Traditionally, the Mentawai live in family units centered upon a longhouse or uma, which are dispersed throughout the jungle. Government settlements now concentrate multiple families within a single area. Livestock, including pigs, which are the lifeblood and economy of Mentawai society, are banished from these same reserves due to introduced social policy. Moreover, the number of Mentawai people still actively practicing cultural customs has been reduced to only 1 percent of the population, isolated to the south of Siberut. Under Pancasila, the five principles for Indonesian state philosophy formulated by the Indonesian nationalist leader Sukarno, the Indonesian Government also began to enforce their new nationwide religious policies issuing a decree declaring that all Indonesian people must belong to one of the five recognized religions (Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, and Buddhism). For the Mentawai Islands, this resulted in an immediate influx of missionaries and an increase in violence and pressure on the people to adopt change. Mentawai people are also facing a challenge in their day-to-day learning. In the government-sponsored schools, Mentawai children are encouraged to speak Indonesian. Mentawai islander's tattoo, great house of Pora, and war boat knabat bogolu. One major environmental problem for the Mentawai people is deforestation as their rainforests contain rich timber. In 2015, 20,000 hectares of forest was set aside as a palm oil plantation area in Siberut. Local NGOs pressured the Indonesian authorities to cancel the permit, which included Mentawai traditional lands. However, even with this success, the possibility of logging remains a constant threat on the islands. More than 80 percent of the Mentawai Islands are owned and managed by the state, which makes it difficult for Mentawai people to manage their own lands and natural resources. Without the collective voice of the Mentawai community, their rights and the protection of Siberut‚Äôs natural resources will be entirely subject to state control. Thus, beginning in 2009 members of the Mentawai community recognized the need to preserve their traditions as a means of improving their health, well-being and quality of life. As a result, they began seeking change, having surveyed the wider community and discerned that an overwhelming majority wanted to protect and perpetuate their culture. One proposed strategy includes community driven indigenous educational programs. They are designed to provide indigenous Mentawai with the opportunity to reconnect with and learn the most important and relevant aspects of their cultural and environmental heritage. The programs, while still being developed and implemented, will run in conjunction with mainstream education and will be taught by the Mentawai for the Mentawai organization. Another promising program called \\"The Cultural and Ecological Education Program\\" provides opportunities for Mentawai people to learn the aspects of indigenous education and lifestyle they deem most important for their current and future prosperity. There is great optimism among the community that these programs will be a success, however, significant financial investment is needed to ensure they flourish in the years to come. Various shops and technology have been brought into the tribe land because of globalization, and tours are even given to those who want to experience the daily life of the tribe and interact with its inhabitants.

After 4 years of applications and amendments, the FCC granted WGBW a construction permit in August 2008 to move the station's city of license from Two Rivers to Denmark, Wisconsin, and to increase its daytime and nighttime broadcast power. On September 14, 2011, WGBW relaunched with its new 10,000 watt day/500 watt night signal from its new transmitter site in Denmark, Wisconsin. For several years, WGBW has been airing a satellite-fed oldies music format; the station had carried Dial Global's \\"Kool Gold\\" service until October 15, 2008, when it moved to Citadel Media's \\"The True Oldies Channel\\".

In most depictions of the activity, the practitioner envisions an endless series of identical white sheep jumping over a fence, while counting them as they do so. The idea, presumably, is to induce boredom while occupying the mind with something simple, repetitive, and rhythmic, all of which are known to help humans sleep. Although the practice is largely a stereotype, and rarely used as a solution for insomnia, it has been so commonly referenced by cartoons, comic strips, and other mass media, that it has become deeply engrained into popular culture's notion of sleep. The term \\"counting sheep\\" has entered the English language as an idiomatic term for insomnia. Sheep themselves have become associated with sleep, or lack thereof. The effectiveness of the method may depend upon the mental power required. An experiment conducted by researchers at Oxford University, though not involving livestock as the object of visualization, found that subjects who imagined \\"a beach or a waterfall\\" were forced to expend more mental energy, and fell asleep faster, than those asked to \\"simply distract from thoughts, worries and concerns.\\" Harvey, Allison G., and Suzanna Payne. 2002. ‚ÄúThe management of unwanted pre-sleep thoughts in insomnia: distraction with imagery versus general distraction.‚Äù Behaviour Research and Therapy. 40 (3): 267-277. Sleep could be achieved by any number of complex activities that expend mental energy. An early reference to counting sheep as a means of attaining sleep can be found in Illustrations of Political Economy by Harriet Martineau, from 1832: > \\"It was a sight of monotony to behold one sheep after another follow the > adventurous one, each in turn placing its fore-feet on the breach in the > fence, bringing up its hind legs after it, looking around for an instant > from the summit, and then making the plunge into the dry ditch, tufted with > locks of wool. The process might have been more composing if the field might > have been another man's property, or if the flock had been making its way > out instead of in; but the recollection of the scene of transit served to > send the landowner to sleep more than once, when occurring at the end of the > train of anxious thoughts which had kept him awake.\\" (p. 355‚Äì356) An even earlier reference can be found in \\"Don Quixote\\" by Miguel de Cervantes, from 1605 (the exception being Cervantes substituting \\"goats\\" for \\"sheep\\"): > \\"Let your worship keep count of the goats the fisherman is taking across, > for if one escapes the memory there will be an end of the story, and it will > be impossible to tell another word of it.\\" Cervantes probably adapted the story of counting goats from a story of counting sheep in the early twelfth-century Spanish work Disciplina Clericalis. The section The King and his Story-teller (section 12) uses the idea of counting sheep humorously.Ancient origins of counting sheep to fall asleep Disciplina Clericalis draws mainly on literary sources from the Islamic world. Counting sheep was probably a widely recognized practice in the Islamic world before the early twelfth century. In popular culture A Serta trailer, featuring characters from the \\"Counting Sheep\\" advertising campaign. Serta, an American mattress manufacturer, uses animated sheep characters in its \\"Counting Sheep\\" advertising campaign, which it launched in 2000. The advertisements and characters were created by Aardman Animations. In Goodnight Mr. Bean, the thirteenth episode of the Mr. Bean television series, Mr. Bean has difficulty falling asleep. He tries sleeping in different positions (along with sleeping with his face on pillow until he can't breathe), then watches a chess game on TV. As he nearly falls asleep, he becomes startled when the television channel cuts to a Bodyform advertisement via a star swipe featuring loud rock music. Finally, he takes out a picture of a flock of sheep and begins counting them, first with his finger and then, after losing count a few times, with the assistance of a calculator. When he sees the number of sheep (albeit inaccurate) on the calculator display, he finally falls asleep. After the closing credits, he rolls out of bed and falls onto the floor, ending the episode. In Shaun the Sheep Championsheeps, a 2012 series of sports-themed animated shorts, the \\"counting sheep\\" clich√© is referenced in the episode entitled \\"Steeplechase\\". In the short, Shaun and his fellow sheep participate in the steeplechase event. Bitzer the dog, who is the referee, and the other sheep and farm animals, who are spectators, all fall asleep watching Shaun and the other sheep running around the track and jumping over the hurdles. The title of Philip K. Dick's science fiction novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, references this term.

In 1758, Linnaeus classified the northern parula as a tit, Parus americanus, and as taxonomy developed the genus name was modified first to Parulus and then the current form. The family name, Parulidae, also derives from this source. Most recently, the two species were: * Northern parula, Parula americana * Tropical parula, Parula pitiayumi (Flame-throated and crescent-chested warblers were formerly classified in this genus.) Taxonomy Recent genetic research has suggested that Parula and Setophaga are congeneric and should be merged. As the name Setophaga (published in 1827) takes priority over Parula (published in 1838), both the species would be transferred to Setophaga where this is accepted.Lovette, I. J. et al. (2010). A comprehensive multilocus phylogeny for the wood-warblers and a revised classification of the Parulidae (Aves). Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 57 (2): 753-770. Abstract This change has been accepted by the North American Classification Committee of the AOU,Chesser, R. T. et al. (2011). Fifty-Second Supplement to the American Ornithologists‚Äô Union Check-list of North American Birds. Auk 128 (3): 600-613 fulltext and the IOC.,IOC World Bird List Family Parulidae however the South American Classification Committee of the AOU continues to use the genus Parula. Biology The northern parula winters south of its breeding ranges in Central America and the West Indies, where the tropical parula is a usually a permanent resident. Parula warblers are tiny, 11‚Äì12 cm long. They have yellow, orange or red throats, with the color extending further down the underparts in some species. The upperparts and wings are various shades of grey or blue-gray, and the mantle is greener or blacker than the rest of the back. The breeding habitat is woodlands with clearings. These warblers nest low in a tree or on the ground, laying 3-7 eggs in a cup nest. Parula warblers feed on insects and spiders, often caught by flycatching, and they have distinctive buzzing songs and loud chip calls. In art Birds of America John James Audubon illustrated a pair of northern parulas in Birds of America (published in London 1827‚Äì38), Plate 15 entitled \\"Blue Yellow-backed Warbler - Sylvia americana\\". The birds are shown perched on a Louisiana flag (Iris fulva) painted by Joseph Mason to which Audubon added the two birds in 1821. This led to a group of irises in Louisiana known as the \\"Louisiana irises\\".Charlotte Seidenberg The image was engraved and colored by the Robert Havell, London workshops. The original watercolor by Audubon was purchased by the New York History Society where it remains as of January 2009. The distinctive color scheme of the Parula (a soft fade from blue to yellow) has led to a Heat Map color scheme with the same name, used as the default plotting colors in the MATLAB programming language since October 2014. Parula replaces the previous default, \\"Jet\\", which was a full rainbow- depiction color scheme. The company has stated that having a dichromatic color transition is an asset to data analysis as it eliminates the \\"Apparent changes\\" that occur over a rainbow color scheme. (Note that even a perfectly smooth color gradient over a rainbow will appear to have distinct stripes, which can obscure more subtle gradients in the data). The Parula colormap also has the effect that when plotted in grayscale, the colors also map to a smooth gradient from dark to light grey.

He graduated from the 11th class of the Imperial Japanese Army Academy in November 1899, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Guards Engineering Battalion. He was sent as a military engineer to the Japanese garrison force in the Chinese Empire, and served there during the Russo- Japanese War. Afterwards, he served in a number of administrative and staff positions within the Imperial Japanese Army General Staff. He graduated from the 21st class of the Army Staff College in 1909. he then served as a military engineer in the Kwantung Leased Territory, instructor at the Army Artillery School and was sent to France as a military attach√© and official Japanese military observer during World War I. While in Paris, he was exposed to the common theory that an international Jewish conspiracy was behind the war, thereafter he began to research into issues related to Freemasonry, and the so-called ‚ÄúJewish-problem‚Äù, as a result of which he became a fervent anti- Semite and leading voice of anti-Semitic propaganda in Japan.Goodman, Jews in the Japanese Mind In January 1920, he was assigned to the Vladivostok garrison during the Japanese Siberian intervention as afterwards commander of the Harbin Special Operations Office. This office was responsible for intelligence activities, counter-espionage, and analysis of political and military information about the USSR. Harbin was home to a large population of Russians, including many Jews. A strong supporter of military aviation from his first- hand experiences in World War I, Shi≈çden returned to Japan in 1922 to assume command of the Army Aviation School. He later served on the Military Aviation Bureau within the General Staff. In 1924, he was promoted to major general. He subsequently served as Japanese Army delegate to the League of Nations, commander of H≈çyo Fortress and on the staff of the IJA 16th Division and IJA 3rd Division. In August 1929 he was promoted to lieutenant general, and went into the reserves immediately thereafter. =Political career= After his retirement, Shi≈çden served in the largely honorary post as Chairman of the Imperial Aviation Association, which promoted the development of Japanese military aviation and ran donation campaigns for the funding of new aircraft, and as an official of the Kokuhonsha. In 1936, he translated \\"The Protocols of the Learned Elders of Zion\\" from French into Japanese.Renolds, Japan in the Fascist Era. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded a task force to study the role of Jews in international politics and economic affairs in 1936, Shi≈çden was appointed director. In 1938, he participated in an anti-Semitic conference in Erfurt in Nazi Germany and met with Julius Streicher the editor of the anti-Semitic newspaper Der St√ºrmer, in Nuremberg, The June 1939 edition of the paper dedicated a whole page to \\"General Shi≈çden , the anti-Semitic Japanese\\".

State Trail System. It recognizes the Revolutionary War Overmountain Men, Patriots from what is now East Tennessee who crossed the Unaka Mountains and then fought in the Battle of Kings Mountain in South Carolina. Location The OVHT follows the route from Abingdon, Virginia at the Abingdon Muster Grounds, fording the Watauga River at Sycamore Shoals through present day Elizabethton, Tennessee, crossing the Doe River twice near both Hampton, Tennessee and Roan Mountain, Tennessee, and ascending over the steep Unaka Mountains of Tennessee and North Carolina, on through South Carolina to the site of the Battle of Kings Mountain now within Kings Mountain National Military Park. The trail network consists of a corridor, including a branch from Elkin, North Carolina, that joins the main route at Morganton, North Carolina. In Rutherford County, North Carolina, the trail follows the approximate location of Rock Road through the Gilbert Town Historic District. Fifty-seven miles (92 km) of OVHT are officially developed for public use, and development continues on the remaining sections. The official sections of the trail were established through agreements with current landowners and often have overlapping designations. All officially certified segments are identified through the use of signs displaying the trail logo (an Overmountain man in profile on a brown and white triangle) or a white triangular blaze. A parallel Commemorative Motor Route travels along state highways and, in some stretches, actually travels over the old historic roadway. The Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail is a cooperative effort of the National Park Service, the U.S. Forest Service, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, the Overmountain Victory Trail Association, the N.C. Division of Parks and Recreation, local governments, local citizens' associations, local historical societies and the states of Virginia, Tennessee, North Carolina, and South Carolina. History Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail maker at Cowpens National Battlefield, South Carolina In anticipation of both the upcoming American Bicentennial of the Declaration of Independence in 1776 and the 1980 bicentennial of the Battle of King's Mountain, many citizens in the five states along the original routes‚Äîwhich included Georgia --- reenacted and hiked along the segments of the Appalachian mountain trails and highways closely following the path of the actual 1780 march to the battle site located near present-day Kings Mountain, North Carolina, on the North Carolina-South Carolina border. Hikers, military reenactors, and scouts have long followed the segments of the famous overmountain victory trail, and in 1975 three Elizabethton boy scouts were among those who completed the first re-enactment of the overmountain march (approximately 214 miles in one direction) from Elizabethton to King's Mountain and were met at a ceremony by U.S. Vice President Nelson Rockefeller at the Kings Mountain National Military Park near Blacksburg, South Carolina. Many of these same OVT hikers, reenactors, and area citizens later sought federal recognition of the overmountain march to the Battle of King's Mountain as being analogous to the spontaneous response of the patriot Minutemen at Lexington and Concord during the American Revolutionary War. OVT supporters worked with representatives of other American trails to create what became known as the National Trails System and later carried scrolls petitioning Congress for national designation of the OVT route. The Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail was officially designated as a national historic trail during September 1980 by federal legislation authorized by the U.S. Congress, and later in 1980, President Jimmy Carter‚Äîrecognizing the historical significance of the frontier patriots marching over the Appalachian Mountains to defeat the Loyalist army at the Battle of King's Mountain‚Äîsigned federal law designating the historical overmountain route as the Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail, the first National Historic Trail established within the eastern United States, exactly 200 years after the event it commemorates.Overmountain Victory National Historic Trail (U.S. National Park Service)Overmountain Victory Trail Association In June 2019, the North Carolina General Assembly passed legislation which added the OVT's route within NC to the State Trail System. The enabling legislation directed the North Carolina Division of Parks and Recreation (NCDPR) to coordinate with the National Park Service on development of the trail within the state, and it gave NCDPR the authority to purchase or accept donations of land for the trail.

Overview Except for a form called the \\"placement new\\", the operator denotes a request for memory allocation on a process's heap. If sufficient memory is available, initialises the memory, calling object constructors if necessary, and returns the address to the newly allocated and initialised memory. A request, in its simplest form, looks as follows: p = new T; where is a previously declared pointer of type (or some other type to which a pointer can be assigned, such as a superclass of ). The default constructor for , if any, is called to construct a instance in the allocated memory buffer. If not enough memory is available in the free store for an object of type , the request indicates failure by throwing an exception of type . This removes the need to explicitly check the result of an allocation. The deallocation counterpart of is , which first calls the destructor (if any) on its argument and then returns the memory allocated by back to the free store. Every call to must be matched by a call to ; failure to do so causes memory leaks. syntax has several variants that allow finer control over memory allocation and object construction. A function call-like syntax is used to call a different constructor than the default one and pass it arguments, e.g., p = new T(argument); calls a single-argument constructor instead of the default constructor when initializing the newly allocated buffer. A different variant allocates and initialises arrays of objects rather than single objects: p = new T [N]; This requests a memory buffer from the free store that is large enough to hold a contiguous array of objects of type , contiguously, and calls the default constructor on each element of the array. Memory allocated with the must be deallocated with the operator, rather than . Using the inappropriate form results in undefined behavior. C++ compilers are not required to generate a diagnostic message for using the wrong form. The C++11 standard specifies an additional syntax, p = new T[N] {initializer1, ..., initializerN}; that initializes each to . =Error handling= If cannot find sufficient memory to service an allocation request, it can report its error in three distinct ways. Firstly, the ISO C++ standard allows programs to register a custom function called a with the C++ runtime; if it does, then this function is called whenever encounters an error. The may attempt to make more memory available, or terminate the program if it can't. If no is installed, instead throws an exception of type . Thus, the program does not need to check the value of the returned pointer, as is the habit in C; if no exception was thrown, the allocation succeeded. The third method of error handling is provided by the variant form , which specifies that no exception should be thrown; instead, a null pointer is returned to signal an allocation error. =Overloading= The operator can be overloaded so that specific types (classes) use custom memory allocation algorithms for their instances. For example, the following is a variant of the singleton pattern where the first call allocates an instance and all subsequent calls return this same instance: #include #include class Singleton; namespace { void* g_instance = nullptr; std::size_t g_refcount = 0; } // namespace class Singleton { public: static void* operator new(std::size_t nbytes) { if (g_instance  nullptr) { g_instance = std::malloc(nbytes); } g_refcount++; return g_instance; } static void operator delete(void* p) { if (--g_refcount  0) { std::free(g_instance); g_instance = nullptr; } } }; This feature was available from early on in C++'s history, although the specific overloading mechanism changed. It was added to the language because object-oriented C++ programs tended to allocate many small objects with , which internally used the C allocator (see ); that, however, was optimized for the fewer and larger allocations performed by typical C programs. Stroustrup reported that in early applications, the C function was \\"the most common performance bottleneck in real systems\\", with programs spending up to 50% of their time in this function.  The C++ language construct that only allocates memory is called . It is used by in the allocation phase. It can be overridden per class or globally to define a specific memory allocator. Relation to malloc and free Since standard C++ subsumes the C standard library, the C dynamic memory allocation routines , , and are also available to C++ programmers. The use of these routines is discouraged for most uses, since they do not perform object initialization and destruction. and were, in fact, introduced in the first version of C++ (then called \\"C with Classes\\") to avoid the necessity of manual object initialization. In contrast to the C routines, which allow growing or shrinking an allocated array with , it is not possible to change the size of a memory buffer allocated by . The C++ standard library instead provides a dynamic array that can be extended or reduced in its template class. The C++ standard does not specify any relation between / and the C memory allocation routines, but and are typically implemented as wrappers around and . Mixing the two families of operations, e.g., 'ing 'ly allocated memory or 'ing 'd memory, causes undefined behavior and in practice can lead to various catastrophic results such as failure to release locks and thus deadlock.

That historic link between Woodbury and the world of business has been maintained throughout the years. Woodbury was coeducational from its founding, making it one of the earliest colleges West of the Mississippi to admit women. The original mission of Woodbury University was to educate Los Angeles residents in the practical areas of business: bookkeeping, commercial law, and telegraphy. For a time, Woodbury could boast that 10% of Los Angeles' citizenry were attending the institution and its earliest alumni lists form a who's who of 19th century Los Angeles.The Princeton Review. In 1931, the division of professional arts was established to focus on those fields of design that are closely allied to business: commercial art, interior design, and fashion design. Woodbury then became a college of business administration and design. In 1969, Woodbury introduced a graduate program leading to the Master of Business Administration (MBA) degree. In 1974, Woodbury College became Woodbury University. In 1982, Computer Information Systems was added as a major, followed in 1984 by Architecture. In 1987, the Weekend College program for working adults was established with the aid of grants from The Fletcher Jones Foundation and The William Randolph Hearst Foundation. In 1994 the university formally organized its undergraduate and graduate programs into three schools: the School of Architecture and Design, the School of Arts and Sciences, and the School of Business and Management.Woodbury ‚Äì History That year three majors in the School of Arts and Sciences came into being: Psychology, Politics & History and Liberal Arts & Business.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 17, 2002. \\"Leela's Homeworld\\" was written by Kristin Gore and directed by Mark Ervin. The episode reveals Leela's true origin as a mutant who was abandoned by her parents so she could have a better life. She was disguised as an alien, as it is illegal for mutants to live on the surface. Plot The Professor announces some good news: Leela's old orphanarium has named her orphan of the year, and that he has invented a machine that makes glow-in-the-dark noses. The machine produces enormous amounts of toxic waste, and Hermes tells him to get rid of it. The Professor hires Bender for the job, and he dumps the waste into the sewer. At the orphanarium's award ceremony, the headmaster presents a story of Leela's arrival and Leela delivers a speech which profoundly inspires the orphans. However, back at Planet Express, Fry finds Leela in tears, and she admits she still longs to have parents. Bender expands his one-time dumping into a full waste management service. The sewer mutants grow angry with Bender's disposal technique and abduct him, Fry, and Leela. The mutants sentence them to be lowered into a lake of chemicals which will turn them into mutants. Two hooded mutants break from the group and swing the crane the three are tied to, dropping them on the far side of the mutagenic lake. The mutant mob pursue them. Fry, Leela, and Bender take refuge in a mutant home, where they find photos and news clippings of every major event in Leela's life. Leela is frozen in horror at the thought of a mutant having been stalking her her whole life, giving the mob the opportunity to capture them. However, after a whispered word from the hooded mutants, the crew's sentence is commuted to exile. They are flown by hot air balloon to a surface access ladder hanging over the lake. Fry and Bender emerge on the surface, but Leela, determined to find out what the hooded mutants know about her, dives into the chemical lake. To her surprise, she is unaffected by the chemicals. Fry heads to the orphanarium to get some clues to what is going on, and the headmaster gives him the alien-language note that was left with Leela when she was abandoned. Fry takes the note to the Professor for analysis. Leela pursues the hooded mutants through the sewers back to the home with the shrine to herself. Finding that one of them has a bracelet identical to one she has had since before coming to her orphanarium, Leela hypothesizes that they killed her parents, and the hooded mutants confess. Before Leela can kill the two in her rage, Bender shoots Fry through the ceiling using his waste disposal pump. Fry stops Leela and removes the mutants' hoods, revealing they are one-eyed. Fry explains that though the Professor could not translate the note, his analysis showed that it was written on a brand of toilet paper that is used primarily in the sewers, cluing Fry in to the fact that the hooded mutants are Leela's parents. Her parents confess that, wanting Leela to have a better life than that of a mutant, they left her at the orphanarium with an alienese note so she would be assumed to be an alien. A tearful reunion ensues, and the episode closes with a montage of scenes that show Leela's parents secretly watching over her throughout her life. Continuity This episode reveals Leela's origins, something she had been searching for all throughout the series. Until this episode, Leela believed she was an alien who was abandoned on Earth after her home planet collapsed (as seen in \\"A Bicyclops Built for Two\\"). The revelation of her true origin in this episode was previously foreshadowed when Leela's parents appeared in a crowd of mutants in the season two episode \\"I Second That Emotion\\". Production The idea for the character Leela and her back story were conceived by Matt Groening and David X. Cohen before they even pitched the series to Fox. As the plot for this episode developed, they realized that the design of the characters needed to change to look less normal. In the original design, Morris had a normal mouth and Munda had normal human arms, one of which was visible in her original appearance in \\"I Second That Emotion\\". For a while, the idea was thrown around to stay true to some aspects of this design and Munda had one normal human arm and one tentacle arm. Eventually it was decided to make both arms tentacles and work under the assumption that in the previous appearance she had been wearing something similar to a human flesh colored glove. There was a large amount of debate amongst the writers as to whether the truth of Leela's origin should be revealed to the viewer before Leela realized it or if it should be a surprise for the viewers as well. The final decision was made based on the idea that it would be easier to make jokes if the viewer were in on the plot. The song played during the ending montage is \\"Baby Love Child\\" by Pizzicato Five; the scene was slightly extended due to a desire to include more of the song. Producers claim that the montage was inspired by the musical sequences used on Homicide: Life on the Street. Reception Along with the episodes \\"Jurassic Bark\\" and \\"The Luck of the Fryrish\\", this episode is considered to be a fan favorite and one of the most emotional episodes of the series. In its initial airing, the episode received a Nielsen rating of 3.4/5, placing it 71st among primetime shows for the week of February 11‚Äì17, 2002. Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A, particularly praising the execution of a story that could have been forgettable if done any other way. He also praised the episode's final sequence and its music.

It would be the last time Kane would ever play with Thunders and Nolan, as the two musicians would pass away within a year of each other (Kane died of leukemia a month after playing a formal New York Dolls show with surviving members David Johansen and Sylvain Sylvain). The show was also filmed with a single VHS video camera and would become a popular bootleg amongst Thunders' fans; the footage was officially released, with the consent of Thunders' and Kane's estates, in November 2004 as the DVD Thunders, Nolan and Kane: You Can't Put Your Arms Around A Memory. The audio had been previously released legitimately by Triple X Records as In the Flesh. The second CD consists of a Heartbreakers live performance from December 1980, and an acoustic show recorded in Osaka, Japan in April 1991, several days before Thunders' death. It would be the last Thunders performance to ever be recorded.

Early life and education Sax was born in Spokane, Washington in 1892. His parents were pioneer farmers and active in civic affairs; his father was the mayor of Colville, Washington. Sax's early education was in the Colville schools, and in 1912 he continued his studies at Washington State College. He majored in agriculture, and his subsequent decision to undertake graduate work was influenced by the botanist and plant breeder Edward Gaines. In college, he met and married Hally Jolivette, his cytology teacher, and they later had three sons. Following his graduation, Hally accepted a position at Wellesley College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, and they moved to the East Coast in 1916. Sax enrolled in the doctoral program at the Bussey Institution Graduate School of Applied Biology at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts and completed his MA in 1917. He went on to do his doctoral work at Harvard University, receiving his D.Sc. in 1922. He served as a private in the US Army from 1917 to 1918 in World War I. Scientific career In 1918, Sax took a job as an instructor in the Department of Genetics at the University of California, Berkeley, where he worked with E. B. Babcock on the genetics of the genus Crepis. In 1920 he took an appointment at the Riverbank Laboratories in Geneva, Illinois working on wheat genetics, but he moved on from that job soon after when he took a position at the Maine Agricultural Experiment Station in Orono, Maine. In 1928 he left Orono to take a teaching position in Harvard's genetics department at the Bussey Institution. However, the department was dissolved before his arrival, and he transferred to the cytology department at the University's Biological Laboratories in Cambridge, Massachusetts. = Contribution to radiation cytology= Forsythia x intermedia 'Karl Sax' In 1938 Sax published a paper entitled \\"Chromosome Aberrations Induced by X-rays,\\" which demonstrated that radiation could induce major genetic changes by affecting chromosomal translocations, a chromosome abnormality. The paper is thought to mark the beginning of the field of radiation cytology, and led him to be called the \\"father of radiation cytology.\\" =Plant breeding= Sax bred new varieties of ornamental trees and shrubs including Malus species (both apples and crabapples), magnolias, forsythias, and cherries. He hybridized two Japanese cherries, Prunus subhirtella and Prunus x yedoensis, then back- crossed the resulting hybrid with P. subhirtella, and named his cross Prunus x 'Hally Jolivette' in honor of his wife. A cultivar of Forsythia bred by Sax was named 'Karl Sax' by a nurseryman. In 1946 he was appointed acting director of Harvard's Arnold Arboretum, in 1947 becoming the director ‚Äì a post he held until 1954. =Demography= Sax was also interested in human demography. In 1955 he wrote Standing Room Only: The Challenge to Overpopulation, on the consequences of uncontrolled human population growth. Sax became associated with Planned Parenthood and was a member of the Population Association of America. Honors Sax was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1966, he and Hally were co-recipients of the Mary Soper Pope Memorial Award in botany.\\"Cranbrook Institute of Science Director's Papers\\". Cranbrook website. Retrieved Dec. 27, 2016. In 1959 he retired and moved to Media, Pennsylvania where he continued his work on plant breeding. Karl Sax died on October 8, 1973. References *\\"Dr. Karl Sax Dies; Botanist Was 81\\".

It was issued a Massachusetts license plate 3335 VI. While it was initially reported that Adnan and Ameer Bukhari had rented and driven the car, the accepted story is now that Mohamed Atta rented the car, although later reports continued to suggest that Adnan Bukhari fell under suspicion because of documents found within the car. The car had been rented from the Logan International Airport terminal in Boston, Massachusetts by Atta at 6:08pm Sunday, September 9. He provided his address of 10001 W Atlantic Boulevard in Coral Springs, Florida, where he is believed to have stayed in room #122. He listed his phone number as 954-815-3004, a number also associated with Fayez Banihammad. He used his Visa card ending in 7778 to pay for the rental. According to the Associated Press story on September 13, the same Boston terminal had also rented Atta the Mitsubishi sedan seized at Logan Airport. Atta is thought to have picked up Abdulaziz al-Omari on September 10, and the two of them drove it to a Comfort Inn in South Portland, Maine, where they spent the night in room 233. At 8:31pm, the car was photographed with two occupants at a KeyBank drive-thru ATM at 445 Gorham Road in South Portland. According to parking receipts found in the car, it arrived at the Portland International Jetport at 5:40am on September 11, and was parked on the first level. After checking in at 5:43, and passing security and an x-ray machine at 5:45, Atta and Omari are believed to have taken the 6:20 Colgan Air Flight 5930 to Boston. Officials became aware of the car around 11pm on September 11, and by 3:30am on September 12, the car was the subject of a search warrant issued to FBI agent James Lechner, and taken by a flatbed truck to a crime lab in Augusta, Maine.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 10, 2002. The episode is a Valentine's Day-themed episode that centers on Bender's relationship with the artificial intelligence of the Planet Express Ship. The subplot involves Fry trying to express his feelings for Leela through the use of Valentine's Day candy. The episode parodies 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Plot  A few days before Valentine's Day, the Planet Express crew tries to land a delivery contract with Romanticorp, a company that produces romantic things. During a tour of the facilities, Fry becomes obsessed with finding the perfect conversation heart to express his feelings for Leela, but she just finds this antic annoying, and says she finds words irrelevant next to the quality of the man saying them. Planet Express gets the contract and with the additional funding, Professor Farnsworth makes some upgrades to the Planet Express Ship. The upgrades include a new personality, complete with a female voice module. Bender and the ship's new personality fall for each other and start dating. Bender quickly grows tired of the ship, and begins cheating on her. The ship, suspicious of Bender, begins acting in an increasingly possessive and erratic manner. The crew is assigned the task of delivering several tons of conversation hearts to Lrrr as a peace offering. The Omicronians are highly offended by the chalky candies and their saccharine messages. While escaping from the Omicronian death fleet, Bender decides to break up with the Planet Express Ship. This cracks the ship's fragile mind, and it comes to a stop, allowing the Omicronian missiles to strike. The ship is sent tumbling through space, dented and scorched, but physically intact. Leela attempts to console the ship, but fails. The ship decides to fly into a quasar so that the power of the ten billion black holes in it will merge her and Bender into a perfect quantum singularity. She offers to stop if Bender merges his programming with hers, but he refuses. To eliminate any interference from Fry or Leela, the ship turns off the oxygen and artificial gravity. They don the on-board oxygen tanks to survive and make plans to disable the ship. Bender distracts the ship by taking her up on her earlier proposal to merge their programming, while Leela begins shutting down the ship's brain by popping the tops of its carbonated logic unit. While searching the conversation hearts, Fry notices that Leela's oxygen supply is critically low. He hooks her mask up to his tank to keep her alive. Completely oblivious to this sacrifice, Leela finishes shutting down the ship's artificial intelligence, returning every system to normal. She then finds Fry unresponsive due to the lack of oxygen. Leela gives him mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Fry awakens and coughs up a candy heart with the perfect message, \\"U leave me breathless\\"; the two smile and wish each other a Happy Valentine's Day. Bender emerges, unaware that a little of the ship's program is still merged with his. Leela decides to dump the undelivered hearts into the quasar instead of cleaning them up. The hearts vaporize, producing a romantic fuchsia-colored radiation that is harmless on Earth and visible during Valentine's Day, but that destroys many planets en route. Couples around Earth happily gaze at the beautiful space phenomena.  Production  Lucy Liu's lines in this episode were recorded during the production of the season three episode \\"I Dated a Robot\\". When recording Liu's lines for \\"I Dated a Robot\\", the staff had her record around six generic lines, with the intent that at least one of them would be used as a throwaway joke in a future episode.

It was recorded on September 17, 1962, and released in February 1963 by United Artists Jazz.\\"Album Reviews\\" (February 9, 1963) Billboard, p. 28. All but one of the compositions were written by Ellington, with four of the seven on the original LP being recorded for the first time on this album. Later releases on CD added eight tracks from the same recording session. The album was reviewed positively at the time of its release and subsequent reviews have remained highly favorable. Negative comments have concentrated on differences in playing style among the three musicians, brought about by the generational gap between Ellington and the others, and an argument that led to Mingus leaving the studio mid-session. Hundreds of musicians have been influenced by the recording, in particular by the freedom of individual expression within a small-group setting. Background Producer Alan Douglas had helped Duke Ellington with errands when they were both working in Paris in the early 1960s. Later, after Douglas had joined United Artists and moved to New York, he received, according to his own account, a surprise visit from Ellington, who suggested recording a piano- based album (Ellington was known as a big band leader). Douglas suggested Charles Mingus as double bassist, who then insisted on having Max Roach as drummer. Mingus had played with Ellington before, deputising for the regular bassist in the leader's orchestra in 1953, but was fired after four days, following a fight with another musician, Juan Tizol. At the time of the 1962 recording, Ellington was 63 years old, while Mingus was 40 and Roach 38. The generational difference was strengthened by Ellington being a guiding figure for the other two, who were born when Ellington was becoming an influence on music. In 1962, Ellington did not have a recording contract, while Mingus was signed to United Artists. According to Roach, the three musicians met the day before the recording, and Ellington told them to \\"Think of me as the poor man's Bud Powell\\" and that he would not like to play only his own material. Recording and music The recording was made on Monday, September 17, 1962, at Sound Makers Studios in New York City, on 57th Street, between Sixth Avenue and Seventh. The session was due to begin at 1 pm. Roach arrived at midday to set up his drums and found that Ellington was already there, writing out some material. Despite his suggestion the previous day, all of the compositions used were brought by Ellington. For each piece, according to Roach, he and Mingus were given \\"a lead sheet that just gave the basic melody and harmony\\", plus a visual image described by the pianist: one example was, \\"crawling around on the streets are serpents who have their heads up; these are agents and people who have exploited artists. Play that along with the music\\". The musicians had declined the chance to rehearse, so the recording, which was made on three-track tape, was of their first experience playing together. Money Jungle is a post-bop album. The original LP contained seven tracks ‚Äì six composed by Ellington, and one, \\"Caravan\\" by Juan Tizol, strongly associated with him. The title track is a 12-bar blues that opens with strongly played notes from Mingus, then Ellington joins in with dissonant chords; Roach supports using ride cymbal, snare and bass drum. In the final minute, Down Beat magazine observed, Mingus bends the \\"strings with such force that he makes the instrument sound like a cross between a berimbau and a Delta blues guitar\\". \\"Fleurette Africaine\\" is a ballad developed from a simple melody stated on the piano, and features \\"Mingus' floating bassline and Roach's understated drumming\\". \\"Very Special\\" is another 12-bar blues, possibly improvised. These three compositions, plus \\"Wig Wise\\", with its \\"angular, descending line\\", were written specifically for this album. On \\"Caravan\\", Ellington plays the melody in low octaves, adding \\"Webern-like notes on the top\\", imitating an orchestral sound. \\"Warm Valley\\" and \\"Solitude\\" are ballads, the latter being a piano solo piece until Mingus and Roach enter in the final minute. The CD releases feature four more compositions: \\"Switch Blade\\", \\"Backward Country Boy Blues\\", \\"REM Blues\\", and \\"A Little Max (Parfait)\\". The last of these is a Latin-influenced track that features Roach. \\"Switch Blade\\" is \\"a slow blues that showcases Mingus' virtuosity with a looseness that puts feeling before precision. [...He] intersperses his basslines with countermelodies and answers to what Duke plays.\\" According to drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, \\"Backward Country Boy Blues\\" was probably given its title because part of the usual blues construction is reversed ‚Äì the V chord precedes the IV chord. There have been persistent rumors of clashes among the musicians during the session. Douglas' version is that Mingus complained about Roach's playing, then left the studio mid-session, taking his bass with him. Ellington caught up with Mingus on the street outside and persuaded him to return. Ellington's account was slightly different ‚Äì the reason for Mingus leaving was the same, but he was persuaded to return at the elevator. Another version is that Mingus was upset because Ellington did not use any of Mingus' compositions for the recording. Duke's son, Mercer Ellington, stated that the trio had a contract with United Artists for two albums, but they could not be persuaded to record together again. Critic Thomas Cunniffe suggests that, listening to the tracks in the order in which they were recorded, \\"one can easily hear the tension building during the uptempo numbers\\", and that Mingus' temporary departure probably occurred after playing \\"Money Jungle\\", which \\"represents the apex of the group's inner tension, with Mingus plucking the strings with his fingernails, Roach firing up the music with polyrhythms and Ellington laying down highly dissonant chords\\". Release history The original LP was released by United Artists Jazz in 1963 in mono and stereo versions. United Artists was bought by EMI in 1979, and subsidiary Blue Note Records reissued the album on CD in 1987. This contained more recordings from the same session: four previously unreleased works written for the session, plus two alternative takes. The order presented in this edition was that in which the tracks were recorded. The sound quality of the original recording was improved for the 2002 Blue Note CD release by engineer Ron McMaster, using the original tapes and 24-bit remastering, adding clarity to the drums in particular. For this release, the first seven tracks were arranged in their original order, with the other four pieces and four alternative takes placed afterward, increasing the number of tracks to 15. Reception and influence =Critics= Contemporaneous reviews were favorable. The album was awarded the Grand Prix of the Jazz Magazine of France. In a five-star review, Down Beat magazine's Don DeMicheal called Money Jungle \\"astonishing\\" and described Roach and Mingus as \\"some of the fastest company around.\\" He repeatedly praised Mingus for pushing Ellington into new musical territory: \\"I've never heard Ellington play as he does on this album; Mingus and Roach, especially Mingus, push him so strongly that one can almost hear Ellington show them who's boss ‚Äì and he dominates both of them, which is no mean accomplishment.\\" Billboard was also positive, describing it as \\"memorable\\" for its content as well as \\"the historical importance of the three playing together\\". Much later reviews have been largely positive. Ken Dryden of AllMusic called it a \\"sensational recording session\\" and recommended it to \\"every jazz fan\\". The Penguin Guide to Jazz claimed that Mingus \\"completely steals the show\\", but suggested that the \\"long-standing Ellington staples\\" \\"Caravan\\" and \\"Warm Valley\\" are relatively weak renditions, and that Mingus either did not know the changes or was disgruntled on the latter track. The Financial Times in 2013 described it as \\"an angular piano-trio masterpiece that [...] confirmed Ellington's inherent modernism\\". Jay Trachtenberg of The Austin Chronicle praised Ellington's playing and \\"the modernity of his ideas\\", and said that the album \\"stands, more than ever, as a masterful meeting of jazz royalty.\\" Writing of the record's 1986 \\"remixed and reprogrammed\\" reissue, Village Voice critic Robert Christgau said \\"the angular chromaticism and modernist swing of this session relegate most piano-trio records back to the supper clubs.\\" The sound quality of the original recording has been described as \\"disappointingly woolly\\", with \\"incidents of peaky distortion from the piano microphone\\". The stereo recording has the piano \\"up front and center\\", with the double bass \\"far to the right channel\\" and the drums \\"Strictly in the left channel and slightly behind the piano\\". =Musicians= Hundreds of musicians have been inspired by the album. Pianist Lafayette Gilchrist states that Money Jungle was the first jazz album that he bought, and that it \\"sounds like an orchestra being played by a trio. I was inspired to make something [...] big and grandiose just like that\\". Drummer Jeff \\"Tain\\" Watts observed that the members of the trio were \\"doing their thing, but they‚Äôre together\\", and compares this with later groups led by Keith Jarrett and Wayne Shorter, stating that the later groups \\"have a much freer way of doing it, but everybody's kind of in their own zone and yet they‚Äôre definitely playing the composition in tune with each other, just like Duke and Max and Mingus were doing on Money Jungle.\\" Trumpeter Miles Davis had a different view of the session: in a 1964 Down Beat blind listening test of the track \\"Caravan\\", he criticised the record company for putting the three musicians together, saying that \\"Max and Mingus can play together, by themselves. Mingus is a hell of a bass player, and Max is a hell of a drummer. But Duke can't play with them, and they can't play with Duke.\\"Down Beat (June 1964) p. 75 (on-line at http://www.noisemademedoit.com/miles-davis-blind-listening-test/). Pianists have been impressed by Ellington's playing. Fred Hersch believes that it is one of Ellington's best recordings on piano, as he was forced by the other musicians to improvise in ways beyond what he would normally have played. Matthew Shipp commented on the free elements in the playing, describing the album as \\"one of the greatest examples of piano playing I've ever heard\\". John Medeski remarked on the forceful, contrapuntal interaction, facilitated by space. Ethan Iverson commented that, on \\"Fleurette Africaine\\", \\"There's a group dynamic present that's quite amazing. [...] It's a forerunner of The Bad Plus\\", the trio that he co-founded. In 1999, the band Rhythm and Brass included Money Jungle tracks on their album More Money Jungle... Ellington Explorations. Drummer Terri Lyne Carrington led the 2013 release Money Jungle: Provocative in Blue, which includes cover versions of tracks from the original album. Of the compositions premiered on the album, \\"Fleurette Africaine\\" and \\"Wig Wise\\" are commonly recorded by others.

He was given the nickname \\"Beulah\\" by colleague Conrad Salinger. His most famous song was one of his earliest, \\"Body and Soul\\" from the revue, Three's A Crowd. Green won four Academy Awards for his film scores and a fifth for producing a short musical film, and he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 1972. He was also honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Vivian and Irina wed on December 16, 1907 in Manhattan.https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:F67Z-WML - Irina Etelka Jellenik (New York Marriages, 1686-1980) John attended Horace Mann School and the New York Military Academy, and was accepted by Harvard at the age of 15, entering the University in 1924. His musical tutors were Herman Wasserman, Ignace Hilsberg and Walter Spalding. Between semesters, bandleader Guy Lombardo heard Green's Gold Coast Orchestra and hired him to create dance arrangements for his nationally famous orchestra. His first song hit, Coquette (1928), was written for Lombardo (with Carmen Lombardo, Guy's brother, and lyricist Gus Kahn). John's father, Vivian, compelled him to take a job as a stockbroker. Disliking the job, and encouraged by his wife, the former Carol Faulk, John left Wall Street to pursue a musical career. Career Green wrote a number of songs which have become jazz standards, including \\"Out of Nowhere\\" and \\"Body and Soul\\". He wrote the scores for various films and TV programs. His earliest songs appeared with the billing \\"John W. Green,\\" a styling he reverted to in the 1960s. After that anyone addressing \\"Johnny\\" was put right with the statement, \\"You can call me John ‚Äì or you can call me Maestro!\\" At the beginning of his musical career, he arranged for dance orchestras, most notably Jean Goldkette on NBC. He was accompanist/arranger to musicians such as James Melton, Libby Holman and Ethel Merman. It was while writing material for Gertrude Lawrence in 1930 that he composed \\"Body and Soul\\", the first recording of which was made by Jack Hylton & His Orchestra eleven days before the song was copyrighted. Between 1930-33, Green was the arranger and conductor for Paramount Pictures and worked with such singers as Ethel Merman, Gertrude Lawrence and James Melton. He composed many of his hit standards during the 1930s, including Bing Crosby's first number one hit recording, \\"Out of Nowhere\\" (1931, co-authored with Edward Heyman), \\"Rain Rain Go Away\\" (1932), \\"I Cover the Waterfront\\", \\"You're Mine You\\", \\"I Wanna Be Loved\\" (all 1933), \\"Easy Come Easy Go\\" and \\"Repeal The Blues\\" (both 1934). He also composed the theme for Max Fleischer's Betty Boop cartoons in 1932, with Edward Heyman as lyricist. After 1933, Green had his own orchestra which he used to perform around the country. He also, until 1940, conducted orchestras for the Jack Benny and Philip Morris records and radio shows. =Carnegie Hall and Astoria Studios= Nathaniel Shilkret and Paul Whiteman commissioned Green to write larger works for orchestra, such as \\"Night Club (Six Impressions for Orchestra with Three Pianos)\\", introduced by Whiteman on January 25, 1933 at Carnegie Hall. Green was at piano \\"one,\\" and Roy Bargy and Ramona played the other two pianos. During the early 1930s, Green also wrote music for numerous films at Paramount's Astoria Studios, conducted in East Coast theatres, and toured vaudeville as musical director for Buddy Rogers. During his two and a half years at Paramount Astoria, he was able to learn more about film scoring from veterans Adolph Deutsch and Frank Tours. =London, radio, and recordings= Green spent much of 1933 in London, where he contributed songs to both Mr. Whittington, a musical comedy for Jack Buchanan at the London Hippodrome, and Big Business, the first musical comedy ever written for BBC Radio. On Green's return to the U.S.A. early in 1934, William S. Paley, president of the Columbia Broadcasting System and an investor in New York's St. Regis Hotel, encouraged him to form what became known as Johnny Green, His Piano and Orchestra. (Green added, \\"My arm didn't need much twisting.\\") The orchestra, based for a time at the St. Regis, featured Green's piano and arrangements, whose harmony and mood were among the most sophisticated of the day. It made dance records for the Columbia and Brunswick companies, although in the Depression even the most popular records sold only in small numbers. In 1935, Green starred on CBS's Socony Sketchbook, sponsored by Socony-Vacuum Oil Co. He lured the young California singer Virginia Verrill to headline with him on the Friday evening broadcasts. His regular cast included his band singers Marjory Logan and Jimmy Farrell, essayist Christopher Morley, and stage/screen favorites the Four Eton Boys. A bigger venture yet in commercial radio was The Fred Astaire Hour (a.k.a. The Packard Hour), sponsored by Packard Motors over NBC in 1936 and co-featuring tenor Allan Jones and the comedy of Charles Butterworth. Green's band also backed Astaire on a series of classic recording dates, in both New York and Hollywood, in 1935‚Äì1937. He also served as musical director for The Jell-O Program Starring Jack Benny during its 1935‚Äì1936 season on NBC. =Piano, film, and MGM= He continued conducting on radio and in theatres into the 1940s, also leading a dance band for the short-lived Royale Records label in 1939‚Äì1940, until he decided to move permanently to Hollywood and work in the film business. Green particularly made an impression at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, where in the 1940s, along with orchestrator Conrad Salinger, he was one of the musicians most responsible for changing the overall sound of the MGM Symphony Orchestra, partially through the re-seating of some of the players. This is why the overall orchestral sound of MGM's musicals from the mid-1940s onward is different from the orchestral sound of those made from 1929 until about 1944. Green was the Music Director at MGM from 1949 to 1959. He compiled and arranged the MGM Jubilee Overture in 1954, a tour de force. He produced numerous film scores, such as the one for Raintree County in 1957. On loan out to Universal, he composed the songs for the Deanna Durbin musical, \\"Something in the Wind\\", one of her last films before retiring. Nominated for an Oscar thirteen times, he won the award for the musical scores of Easter Parade, An American in Paris, West Side Story, and Oliver!, as well as for producing the short \\"The Merry Wives of Windsor Overture\\", which won in the Short Subjects (One-Reel) category in 1954. The short subject featured Green conducting the MGM Orchestra on-screen in the music from the opera of the same name by Otto Nicolai. After leaving MGM, Green guest-conducted with various orchestras, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Denver Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony Orchestra, and Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. He also continued to compose the occasional score to films such as Twilight of Honor (1963), Johnny Tiger (1966) and Alvarez Kelly (1966), and contributed the arrangements and musical direction for the critically acclaimed They Shoot Horses, Don't They? in 1969. He was also hired to create the televised Guinness advertisement known as the \\"World\\" ad campaign. He recruited a team which included set designer Grant Major and Oscar-nominated director of photography Wally Pfisher to complete the job. Notable works =Musical director= Johnny Green's credits as musical executive, arranger, conductor and composer are considerable, including such films as Raintree County, Bathing Beauty, Easy to Wed, Something in the Wind, Easter Parade (for which he won his first Academy Award), Summer Stock, An American in Paris (which won him his second Academy Award), Royal Wedding, High Society and West Side Story (another Academy Award winner for him). Although Green was musical director on these films, the orchestrations were usually done by someone else - in the case of the MGM musicals, it was usually Conrad Salinger, and in the case of West Side Story, it was Sid Ramin and Irwin Kostal. =Conductor= As mentioned earlier, Green conducted the orchestra for such famous MGM musicals as An American in Paris, as well as for United Artists' 1961 film version of West Side Story. In 1965, Green conducted the music for that year's new adaptation of Rodgers and Hammerstein's only musical for television, Cinderella, starring Lesley Ann Warren, Walter Pidgeon, Ginger Rogers, and Stuart Damon. Johnny Green also adapted, orchestrated and conducted the music for the film Oliver! (1968), based on the hit musical play, and won an Academy Award for his efforts. He also wrote much of the incidental music heard in the film, basing it on Lionel Bart's songs for the original show. His daughter, Kathe, dubbed Mark Lester's singing voice in the film. =Accreditations= Green was a respected board member of ASCAP. He was a chairman of the music branch of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, leading the orchestra through 17 of the Academy Award telecasts, and a producer of television specials. Personal life He married three times, had a daughter, actress/singer/songwriter Babbie Green, with actress/consumer advocate Betty Furness and two daughters with MGM \\"Glamazon\\" Bunny Waters, including actress and singer Kathe Green. Actress Liza Snyder is his granddaughter. It was during his first marriage to Carol Faulk that most of his hit standards were composed. Before the marriage ended in the mid-1930s, Carol Faulk remarked, \\"We didn't have children, we had songs.\\" See also *Musical film *Broadway theatre References External links *The Johnny Green Papers and Johnny Green Additional Papers are part of the Harvard Theatre Collection, Houghton Library, Harvard University. * Category:1908 births Category:1989 deaths Category:American film score composers Category:Male film score composers Category:MGM Records artists Category:Best Original Music Score Academy Award winners Category:Golden Globe Award-winning musicians Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Horace Mann School alumni Category:New York Military Academy alumni Category:Musicians from New York City Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:20th-century American composers Category:20th-century American male musicians ","title":"Johnny Green"},{"id":"3634598","text":"\\"Poor Poll\\" is a poem written by Robert Bridges in 1921, and first collected in his book New Verse (1925).

In the Classic Mode: The Achievement of Robert Bridges, Associated University Presses, 1978. . Page 118. Both Eliot and Bridges were searching for a medium which would allow the incorporation of a wide variety of material, including phrases in foreign languages. Bridges wrote in a later essay, \\"It was partly this wish for liberty to use various tongues that made me address my first experiment to a parrot, but partly also my wish to discover how a low setting of scene and diction would stand; because one of the main limitations of English verse is that its accentual (dot and go one) bumping is apt to make ordinary words ridiculous\\"Robert Bridges, Collected Essays 1927-1936, page 90 It has been suggestedWilliam Harmon. \\"An Entertaining Coincidence At Least\\".

Blades is situated on \\"Park Street\\" (correct name Park Place) off St James's Street, at the approximate location of the real-life club Pratt's. Inspirations Based on Fleming's notes as well as details of the club included in the novels, Blades is an amalgam of several nearby clubs, several of which Fleming mentions by name in various Bond books. These include: *Boodle's, where Fleming himself was a member and which has a lineage similar to that of Blades (both being descended from the earlier Savoir Vivre Club) as well as having similar architecture; *The Portland Club, which features bridge and where Fleming was a member, preferring the bridge games there because, as at Blades, they were played for high stakes; *White's, with which (like Blades), Beau Brummell, Horace Walpole, and Edward Gibbon had some association and where M's real-life counterpart, Sir Stewart Menzies, was a member, and where Fleming too was a member until moving to Boodle's; and *Brooks's, located quite close to Blades, founded at the same time, sharing its emphasis on gaming and its association with the Hellfire Club, and providing at least one of the famous bets to be found in Blades's betting book.John Timbs, Club Life of London with Anecdotes of the Clubs, Coffee-Houses and Taverns of the Metropolis During the 17th, 18th, and 19th Centuries, vol. 1 (London: Richard Bentley, 1866), 121‚Äì22; John Griswold, Ian Fleming's James Bond: Annotations and Chronologies for Ian Fleming's Bond Stories (AuthorHouse, 2006), 94; Gary Giblin & Christopher Lee, James Bond's London (Daleon Enterprises Inc., 2001), 71, 86‚Äì89; John Pearson, The Life of Ian Fleming (Jonathan Cape, 1966); Ian Fleming, Moonraker (London: Penguin Books., 1955) , chs. 3‚Äì7 Fictional history Blades was founded between 1774 and 1776 and is of a calibre equal to or greater than that of any other club. In fact, Fleming writes that during Blades's annual closings, its members have to \\"pig it\\" at the prestigious White's or Boodle's.Ian Fleming, You Only Live Twice (Glidrose, 1964), ch. 2. It excels in terms of member accommodations, staff, food, and furnishings, and its members include some of the finest card players in the world. The club has only 200 members, and there are only two qualifications for being elected a member: behaving like a gentleman and being able to \\"show\\" ¬£100,000 (¬£ in pounds) in cash or gilt-edged securities. M. is a member of Blades, and James Bond, though not a member, is an occasional guest.Fleming, Moonraker, chs. 3‚Äì7. M. often lunches at Blades, usually eating a spare meal of grilled Dover sole and \\"the ripest spoonful he could gouge from the club Stilton,\\" and always pays his bill with a five-pound note in order to receive newly minted notes and coins as change, a club tradition. As a favour to M., Blades also stocks a cheap Algerian red wine to which M. is partial, but does not include it on the wine list; he calls it \\"Infuriator\\" and drinks it only in small quantities unless he is in a very bad mood.Ian Fleming, The Man with the Golden Gun (Glidrose, 1965), ch. 3. Blades plays a prominent role in the novel Moonraker. M, along with the club chairman Basildon, suspect another member, Sir Hugo Drax, to be cheating at bridge. Because Drax is involved in a nuclear missile project crucial to national security, M and Basildon wish to avoid a scandal. Because of Bond's skill at cards, M invites him to Blades to discern Drax's method of cheating. When Bond finds that Drax is using a shiner (i.e., a highly polished silver cigarette case that allows him to read the cards as he deals), M. and Basildon go along with a plan of Bond's to teach Drax a lesson and discourage him from further cheating. During a very high-stakes bridge game, Bond switches in a cold deck, making Drax believe he has an extraordinarily good hand that in reality allows Bond to achieve a grand slam, costing Drax ¬£15,000.Fleming, Moonraker, chs. 3‚Äì7.

Established in 1933 by Joseph DuMond for the exhibition and study of endangered monkeys in semi-natural habitats after releasing 6 Java Monkeys into a subtropical forest, the park is now home to over 300 primates. As the tagline, \\"Where humans are caged and monkeys run wild!,\\" suggests, the primary experience at Monkey Jungle has guests travel through the park on a caged walkway while different primates roam semi-freely in a natural habitat. Monkey Jungle is one of just a few protected habitats for primates in the United States, and the only one that the public can explore. Guests can embark on trips through a Southeast Asian Wild Monkey Pool & Trail, the Cameroon Gorilla Forest, the Amazonian Rainforest, and visit tropical birds in Wings of Love. Monkey jungle also provides a home to animals such as: sloths, multiple turtle species, and an iguana. Monkey Jungle is not accredited by the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. The park is currently closed to the public. = History = In 1933, aspiring animal behaviorist Joseph DuMond traveled to South Florida and released six Java Monkeys into a dense tropical forest. Unable to get the government funding that was needed to study these primates, DuMond came up with another idea: open the park to the public. Due to the Java Monkeys being territorial, and the newly introduced wandering guests, the monkeys frequently attacked guests. Not wanting to enclose the monkeys, DuMond came up with the most notable feature of Monkey Jungle: the caging of the guests. A 1994 archaeological dig led by archaeologist Robert S. Carr unearthed some important and interesting discoveries in naturally occurring sinkholes at Monkey Jungle. Fossils aged over 10,000 years old were found at the sites, including those from the American Lion, Dire Wolf, Pleistocene horse, and camel. It is one of the largest of such findings in Florida. In 1977, King was the face of a campaign to get him relocated to the Atlanta Zoo, where they have a program that re-socializes gorillas. The campaign grew to be so massive, that it garnered the attention and subsequent involvement of famed primatologist, Jane Goodall. In 2001, Monkey Jungle built a much larger enclosure for King. In 2017, after Hurricane Irma impacted many parts of Florida, four former employees accused Monkey Jungle of animal abuse and mistreatment. The former employees provided picture evidence of terrible enclosure conditions for Mei, an Orangutan that was 32-years old at the time. Pictures of Mei and her enclosure featured rotten foliage and feces all throughout the enclosure as well as on Mei herself. They also provided pictures of a large, oozing, injury on King, Monkey Jungle's gorilla. The former keeper also said that they encouraged the zoo to allow different healing ointments to be applied to King as he would repeatedly wipe of the ointment that was being used, but the pleads went largely ignored. The former keeper also mentioned that besides that and an already corrected enclosure size issue, King was in relatively good spirits. Monkey Jungle soon responded, claiming that the former employees took advantage of the aftermath of Hurricane Irma, and continued on to give their story as to why the conditions were the ways that they were, as well as the different ways that they care for every animal within the park, especially those talked about in the allegations. = Experiences = Along with the ability to walk by and view each area of the park on jungle trails, Monkey Jungle also offers individual experiences and presentations personalized to each area/exhibit.  Wild Monkey Swimming Pool & Trail  Visiting this exhibit brings guests to the home of the Java Macaques, which are native to Southeast Asia. These monkeys are the soul of Monkey Jungle, being the first primates introduced to the park and accounting for the majority of the primates in the park. This 7-acre exhibit provides the guests the opportunity to spectate Java Macaques in an environment similar to one that the species thrives in Southeast Asia. Stick around long enough and guests may even have the opportunity to see them dive into the pond in search of snacks. Daily presentation times for this exhibit are: 10:00 am, 12:15 pm, 2:30 pm, and 4:30 pm.  Cameroon Gorilla Forest  The Cameroon Gorilla Forest experience brings guests to the doorstep of King, Monkey Jungle's own king of the jungle. Guests are able to watch King as he interacts with the environment within his 10-acre enclosure, which is designed to be similar to his natural habitat. King has the enclosure all to himself. Daily presentation times for this exhibit are: 11:00 am, 1:15 pm, and 3:30 pm.  Amazonian Rainforest  The Amazonian Rainforest is a large exhibit that immerses guests into the world of the Amazon Rainforest and is North America's only semi-natural tropical rainforest. Frank DuMond spent over 5 years in the Amazon Rainforest, mostly in a 100-mile radius of Iquitos, Peru, collecting a wide range of plants to ensure that the area was as natural as possible. The monkeys here are free to live however they'd like, with no forced human contact. This provides the opportunity for guests to view the monkeys in a very natural way, allowing for some studies conducted here to receive international attention. Three different species of monkeys call this exhibit a home, all of which have helped make an impact in the science community: Squirrel Monkey - The most plentiful species in the park, Monkey Jungle's Squirrel Monkeys number around 125, making them pretty easy to spot. Black- Capped Capuchin - The largest of the three monkey species in the exhibit, the Black-Capped Capuchin can be easily recognized by guests by the raised black fur on the top of their heads. Widely considered to be one of the smartest of the monkey species, Black-Capped Capuchin's are even involved in programs to assist quadriplegics. Red Howler Monkey - The last of the three monkey species in the exhibit, the Howler Monkey is one of the most unique primates in the entire park. Guests can spot these territorial primates by looking for their distinctive red fur and black face, that is, if they aren't able to locate them by following the sound of their roar-like vocalizations that can be heard about a mile away. Daily presentation times for this exhibit are: 11:30 am, 1:45 pm, and 4:00 pm.  Wings of Love  Monkey Jungle is home to the Wings of Love Foundation, a non-profit organization that created a sanctuary for captive parrots that have been displaced or can no longer be taken care of by their owners. The birds are housed in large geodesic domes alongside intra- species and inter-species companions. The domes are furnished with natural foliage to add to the well being and security of the birds. There are no daily presentation times for this exhibit; guests are free to visit the birds throughout the day! = The DuMond Conservancy = The DuMond Conservancy for Primates and Tropical Forests is the not-for-profit science and education affiliate of Monkey Jungle. The team consists of staff, volunteers, and students who, in partnership with academic institutions and conservation, study the primates and their vulnerable habitats utilizing Monkey Jungle's unique environment. The goal of the DuMond Conservancy is to facilitate the understanding of scientists, students, and the public of nonhuman primates and their habitats. Research focuses on questions regarding primate ecology, biology, and development that are hoped to provide insight into human condition and the means to improve the welfare of nonhuman primate populations. The conservancy's education efforts provide \\"living lab\\" training and research opportunities for those interested in primate conservation efforts, such as conservationists, educators, and young scientists. The conservancy partners with NGOs (Non-Governmental Organizations) in nearby countries native to many nonhuman primate species. They also work to engage the public in conservation related efforts. DuMond conservancy is also home to owl monkeys that were formerly in research labs. Florida's warm climate allows the conservancy to provide the owl monkeys a place to range either freely, in a lush, multi-acre, forest habitat, or in large, secluded enclosures with natural vegetation. DuMond Conservancy at Monkey Jungle provides South Florida Youth the opportunities to learn about conservation efforts and nonhuman primates in an immersive and inclusive environment. This provides the chance to learn about primates, conservation, and STEM related topics to those who are interested in learning, as well as those who don't typically have the opportunities to do so. = References = =External links= * *Aerial close-up of Monkey Jungle *Dumond Conservancy website Category:Tourist attractions in Miami-Dade County, Florida Category:Zoos in Florida Category:Monkey parks Category:1933 establishments in Florida ","title":"Monkey Jungle"},{"id":"3634607","text":"BillyMills Crossing Finish Line 1964Olympics.

Anand failed to qualify for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) exams in London. As luck would have it, Phani Majumdar cast him as a lead in his Hindi film, Rajkumar, released in 1944. He also became associated with Indian People's Theatre Association (IPTA) in Bombay present day Mumbai.

By the early 1950s, he and his younger brother Dev Anand had set up Navketan Productions in Bombay present day Mumbai. Afsar, starring Dev Anand and Suraiya, was the first film made by Navketan, which turned out to be a moderate success. It was followed by Taxi Driver and Andhiyan, both of which he directed for the Navketan banner. While he made his reputation as a director, Anand kept on acting too occasionally. He appeared in Humsafar made in 1957. In 1957 he directed two movies Arpan and Anjali, in which he played lead roles too. He went on to act in Kala Bazar, Kinare-Kinare, Aman, Kanch Aur Heera and Hindustan Ki Kasam, which he directed too. Later on Anand started his own production banner called Himalaya films and teamed up with photographer Jal Mistry, music director Madan Mohan, lyrics writer Kaifi Azmi and actress Priya Rajvansh. Together they gave some of most memorable and unique films in Hindi cinema like Haqeeqat, Heer Raanjha, Hanste Zakhm, and Hindustan Ki Kasam. Anand is known to be the film-maker who 'discovered' Rajesh Khanna from an acting competition. Khanna as a result got his first break and was cast by Anand in the film Aakhri Khat, although G.P.Sippy's 'Raaz' introducing Rajesh Khanna and Babita was the first 'released' film for Rajesh Khanna. Aakhari Khat is known for its beautiful locations, songs penned by Kaifi Aazmi, composed by Khayyam, the beautiful lady Indrani Mukherjee and the child star 'Bunty'.

Divorce remains a very great taboo in India, for religious and cultural reasons, and until 1976, the law did not even permit divorce by mutual consent. Therefore the couple never got divorced. In the 1960s, well after being estranged from his wife, Anand fell in love with Priya Rajvansh, who had made her debut as heroine of his film Haqeeqat. The two fell in love during the making of this film and their relationship lasted all their lives. Priya Rajvansh worked in every single film made by Anand beginning with Haqeeqat, and more surprisingly, she did not work in a single film made by anyone else. Anand remained married to Uma, who refused to grant him a divorce because of the taboo and opprobrium attached to it and because divorce is utterly antithetical to the Hindu religion.

The show also featured Jason Hoyte, who co-hosted the educational show that saw the dynamic duo take the loyal viewership around various secret fishing locations in and around Auckland Harbour. The show especially took off in Australia as Channel 7 featured the show on a weekly basis in the popular Sunday morning slot.

Wakachangi beer In July 2013, Leigh released his own brand of beer, Wakachangi, brewed by Harringtons Brewery. It was initially marketed to students having big parties around the country (notably in Dunedin) and sold in 2-litre bottles.

It has been a privately-owned tourist attraction since it was opened in the early 1880s. The area sustained a significant flood in September 2013, which forced Seven Falls to close until restoration was complete in 2015. There is no parking at Seven Falls. Complementary round trip shuttle service is provided from the Norris Penrose Event Center. Trails from the top of the falls lead to Midnight Falls, near the headwaters of South Cheyenne Creek, and Inspiration Point. Geography Seven Falls is located in Colorado Springs along the Front Range. It is in a natural box canyon in South Cheyenne Ca√±on. The entrance to the canyon is about southwest of downtown Colorado Springs on Cheyenne Boulevard. The South Cheyenne Ca√±on road to Seven Falls has been called \\"The Grandest Mile of Scenery\\" in Colorado. The falls are located in a granite canyon. Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Juniper, and Blue Spruce are found in the Seven Falls park. Overview =The falls= The sum of the height of the seven falls is and there are a total of 224 steps on the staircase from the base of the falls to the peak. There is a wheel-chair- accessible elevator that goes up to the Eagle's Nest observation platform with views of the falls. The falls are named in alphabetical order (not top to bottom): Bridal Veil, Feather, Hill, Hull, Ramona, Shorty, and Weimer. Susan Joy Paul, author of Hiking Waterfalls in Colorado, describes it as \\"seven leaps of plunge, cascade, punchbowl, fan, and horsetail spray.\\" Seven Falls is Colorado‚Äôs only waterfall that is included in the National Geographic list of international waterfalls. Local wildlife includes hummingbirds, the Water Ouzel or American Dipper songbird that swims, and Brook and Rainbow Trout. =Trails= Inspiration Point, Colorado Springs There are two hiking trails that begin at the top of Seven Falls. They are open from May through October until 7 p.m. The Inspiration Point trail is a winding trail to Inspiration Point and takes about one hour round trip. There are views of the city of Colorado Springs and the plains. This was a favored spot of Helen Hunt Jackson's that inspired her poetry. She was originally buried at the point. A shorter trail is about a half-hour hike to Midnight Falls, near the South Cheyenne Creek headwaters. The trails begin at in elevation and end at about in elevation. No vehicle parking is available at the falls. Bicycle parking is available at the entrance. =Rock formations= Just inside the entrance to the Seven Falls property is the Pillars of Hercules, which are high from the floor of the canyon. Across from the Pillars of Hercules is the George Washington profile. At this point, the canyon walls are just apart. History =Late 19th century= Nathaniel Colby homesteaded in South Cheyenne Canyon, including Seven Falls in December 1872. He sold the land rights nine months later for $1,000 (equivalent to $ in ) to the Colorado Springs Land Company. In 1882, fearing logging operations would ruin the scenic area, naturalist James Hull purchased the property. The trail to Inspiration Point was launched in 1883. By 1885, he owned in the canyon. Hull built a stairway to the top of the falls and built a road through the canyon. Customers came by horses, burros, and carriages, and paid a toll to enter Seven Falls. =The 20th century= After Hull's death in 1890, his sons owned the property, which was assessed by the county at $80,000 (equivalent to $ in ) and estimated to be worth more than $200,000 (equivalent to $ in ) by the local Gazette. The property, now was bought for $250,000 (equivalent to $ in ) by Callidore Dwight Weimer in 1905. Weimer, a successful mine owner and developer born in Ohio, had become a permanent resident of Colorado Springs in 1903. Melvin Weimer, and his wife Frances, co-managed the Seven Falls business. Frances was a longtime supporter of the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center and manager of several family businesses in New Mexico and Colorado. It was sold to Al Hill, a Colorado College student and an oilman from Texas, in 1946. To extend business hours into the nighttime, Hill added lights in the canyon in 1947. The Hill family built the Eagle's Nest Observation platform, and cut into the side of the mountain for an elevator, which was updated in 1992. For Christmas in 1947, the canyon was opened at night for free to the people of Colorado Springs, allowing a charity to collect donations, an event that became an annual tradition. The Seven Falls park was wiped out after a flood in 1965. In December 2002, a dynamic Martin Architectural lighting system was installed which bathed the cascades in color. Seven Falls is still known as the only fully lit canyon in the world. =The Broadmoor= Five days of heavy rains in mid-September 2013 caused similar damage to a significant flood in 1965. The worst-hit area of the city, the southwest side of Colorado Springs, received up to of water. The large amount of water flowing over the falls resulted in five falls rather than seven. The Seven Falls park had downed trees, standing water, mud, and a damaged road. The park was closed and the incoming streets were blocked. In April 2014, it was announced that The Broadmoor had purchased Seven Falls, with plans to reopen the park in 2015. The property had been owned by the A.G. Hill family for 68 years. The Broadmoor re-opened Seven Falls on August 13, 2015. The site now features remote parking at the hotel, with a shuttle bus to the canyon, freeing up vehicle congestion and parking issues that had been a problem in the past. The Broadmoor simultaneously opened Restaurant 1858, a fine dining establishment at the foot of the Falls.

Its flagship New York store was located at 712 Fifth Avenue. Henri Bendel was the first retailer to have its own fragrance, to offer in-store makeovers, and to stage its own fashion show. The retailer is credited with developing the shop- within-a-shop merchandising concept that is in use in some department stores today. In the Cole Porter song from 1934 \\"You're the Top\\" made famous by Ethel Merman, Porter incorporates the line \\"You're a Bendel Bonnet - a Shakespeare Sonnet\\", immortalising the brand. In September 2018 it was announced that the owner L Brands would close all 23 stores and end the brand. In January 2019, its physical stores and website were closed. History and influence Henri Willis Bendel was born in Louisiana in 1868 and moved to New York to work as a milliner. He opened his first shop, in Greenwich Village, in 1895. In 1907, he began branding the brown-and-white striped boxes that are still identified with the company. In 1913, Henri Bendel was the first retailer to sell Coco Chanel designs in the U.S. After Bendel's death in 1936, his nephew became the store's president and served until his retirement in 1954. Bendel's nephew, who later founded Belgian Shoes, died in 1997. Geraldine Stutz was president of Henri Bendel from 1957 to 1986. Stutz had \\"a legendary eye for discovering the newest designers and using them first,\\" including Perry Ellis, Jean Muir, Sonia Rykiel, Carlos Falchi, Mary McFadden, and Ralph Lauren. In 1958, Stutz turned the store's main sales floor into a \\"U-shaped 'Street of Shops,'\\" which some consider the forerunner of today's shop-within-a-shop merchandising displays. During the 1960s, Andy Warhol was an in-house illustrator. Beginning in 1994, Izak Zenou's illustrations have appeared on Henri Bendel ads and promotional materials. In recent years, the retailer has aimed to grow from an \\"iconic New York brand\\" into \\"a nationally recognized accessories company.\\" Beginning in 2008, the brand expanded beyond the New York store to become a national chain with 28 stores (in addition to the NYC flagship) across the U.S. In 2009, Henri Bendel stopped selling apparel. In 2014, the New York flagship store and website began selling only Henri Bendel-branded handbags, jewelry, fashion accessories and home fragrances, following the model set at its other stores. Henri Bendel was named Retailer of the Year in 2010 by The Accessories Council. In September 2018, The Wall Street Journal and other media outlets reported that Henri Bendel announced the closing of its 23 stores and ending of its brand after 123 years in business. Owner L Brands said the move was part of efforts to improve profitability and focus on brands like Victoria's Secret. On January 19, 2019 all Henri Bendel stores were closed and its website was shuttered on January 28, 2019. Flagship store  714 Fifth avenue, Manhattan The Flagship store on Fifth Avenue was located in two adjacent buildings, the Rizzoli building and Coty Building, as well as a new five-story building. During renovation of the Coty building, 276 \\"masterwork\\" panes of glass commissioned from Rene Lalique in 1912 were restored. The glass filled three large windows that comprised the front of the second, third and fourth floors of the Henri Bendel store. The building had received landmark status from the city's Landmark Preservation Commission in 1985.[http://s-media.nyc.gov/agencies/lpc/lp/1534.pdf NYC.gov, Landmarks Preservation Commission January 29, 1985, Designation List 175, LP-1534] Of the building, The New York Times' architecture critic Paul Goldberger wrote: > For this mix of new architecture and old, skillfully integrated, holds more > promise for the revival of Fifth Avenue than anything that has happened to > that troubled boulevard in the last decade. Ownership After Bendel's nephew, also named Henri Bendel, retired from the company in 1954, the Bendel family sold the store to a group of investors. In 1980, Henri Bendel president Geraldine Stutz purchased the store with a group of investors from Genesco Inc., a retailing/apparel company that had owned Bonwit Teller and other stores. In 1985, L Brands acquired the Henri Bendel brand. Formerly Limited Brands, the Columbus, Ohio-based company is also the parent of Victoria's Secret, PINK, Bath & Body Works, and La Senza and operates 2,917 company-owned specialty stores in the U.S., Canada and the United Kingdom.

Daughter of Mahdiqoli Khan, the last ruler of the Karabakh khanate (1748‚Äì1822), Natavan was most notable for her lyrical ghazals. Life alt= Natavan was born on August 15, 1832 in Shusha, a town in present-day Nagorno-Karabakh to Mehdigulu Khan (1763-1845) and Badir Jahan Beg√ºm (1802-1861). Being the only child in the family and descending from Panah Ali Khan, she was the only heir of the Karabakh khan, known to general public as the \\"daughter of the khan\\" (). Her name Khurshid Banu (ÿÆŸàÿ±ÿ¥€åÿØÿ®ÿßŸÜŸà) is from Persian and means \\"Lady Sun\\". Her nom de plume Natavan (ŸÜÿßÿ™ŸàÿßŸÜ) is also from Persian and means powerless.Nissman , David B. (1987) The Soviet Union and Iranian Azerbaijan:the use of nationalism for political penetration ,Westview Press ,, p.84 She was named after her grandmother - Khurshud Beg√ºm, daughter of Javad Khan. After her father's death, she inherited vast amounts of lands from her father including 1,315 households, 41 nomadic territories and 7 villages at age of 14. She was put in care of her aunt Gawhar agha who taught her music, poetry and painting. She probably married Kumyk noble Khasay Utsmiev in 1847. She inherited additional number of 9 villages from her mother Badir Jahan Beg√ºm in 1861 after her death. She founded and sponsored the first literary societies in Shusha and in the whole of Azerbaijan. One of them called Majlis-i Uns (\\"Society of Friends\\") founded in 1864 became especially popular and concentrated major poetic-intellectual forces of Karabakh of that time.Abasova, L. V. et al. (eds.) (1992) Istoria azerbaijanskoi muziki Maarif, Baku, p. 116 Natavan was closely engaged in philanthropy, promoting the social and cultural development of Karabakh. Among her famous deeds was a water main that was first laid down in Shusha in 1872, thus solving the water problem of the townsfolk. The local Russian \\"Kavkaz\\" newspaper wrote at the time: \\"Khurshud Banu-Begum left an eternal mark in the memories of the Shushavians and her glory will pass on from generation to generation\\". The aqueduct built by Natavan from famous Shusha white stones were called by the townsfolks \\"Natavan springs\\" and were also considered historical monuments under protection. Natavan also did a lot for the development and popularization of the famous breed of Karabakh horses. Natavan's Karabakh horses took part in the Exposition Universelle (1867), agricultural exhibition in Moscow (1869), in Tbilisi (1882) and were awarded golden medals and certificates of honour. Karabakh horses were also awarded at the Second All-Russian Exhibition in 1869: Meymun - silver medal, Tokmak - bronze medal. At the Exposition Universelle (1867) in Paris, Khan got a silver medal.Yelena Volkova - Karabakh Horses (in Russian) Humanism, kindness, friendship and love were the main themes of Natavan's ghazals and ruba'yat. These sentimental romantic poems express the feelings and sufferings of a woman who was not happy in her family life and who lost her son. Many of these poems are used in folk songs nowadays. Natavan died in 1897 in Shusha. As a sign of respect, people carried her coffin on their shoulders all the way from Shusha to Agdam, some 30 km north-east, where she was buried in a family burial vault. Her sons Mehdigulu Khan and Mir Hasan Aƒüa Mir both left a collection of poems in Persian. Fate of Natavan's monument in Shusha In Shusha, Soviet-era monuments of NatavanNatavan bust then and today (sculptress Hayat Abdullayeva) and other famous Karabakh Azeris including Hajibekov and Bulbul, which once decorated the central streets of Shusha, were severely damaged and dismantled. Polad Bulbuloghlu, then the Minister of Culture of Azerbaijan bought the bronze busts from Georgian scrap metal yard and transported them to Baku.Public Association for the \\"Protection of Right of Migrants and Internally Displaced Persons in Azerbaijan\\" Thomas de Waal who saw the monuments in Baku, wrote: \\"I saw the three bronze heads, forlorn and pocked with bullets, lying in the courtyard of the headquarters of the Red Cross in the center of Baku: the poet Natevan, an earnest girl in a head scarf reading a book, missing a thumb; the composer Hajibekov, a bullet-ridden gentleman in double-breasted suit and broken spectacles; and Bul Bul, a famous singer with a serious domed bronze forehead\\".

Early in his military service, he was a member of the first U.S. aviation detachment sent to the Vietnam War in August 1961, Operation Farm Gate. Secord left Vietnam in 1965 to attend Air Command and Staff College. Afterwards, he returned to Southeast Asia, being detailed to the Central Intelligence Agency for duty in the Secret War in Laos. While in Laos, he was responsible for several notable military actions. One was the Battle of Lima Site 85. Another was the only successful prisoner of war rescue of the Vietnam War. Both of these came about because of his responsibilities for overseeing the operations of the Royal Lao Air Force, Air America, and Raven FACs. After his Southeast Asian service, Secord commanded the 603rd Special Operations Squadron and underwent further advanced military education at the Naval War College. He then served on staff duty in the Department of Defense from June 1972 through September 1975. His next posting returned him to Iran, this time managing all U. S. military assistance to the Iranians. He was involved in the Iran‚ÄìContra affair, making $2 million on the arms transactions and charged with lying to Congress about it but acquitted. Secord went into business in the private sector after his retirement from the USAF, Background and education Richard Vernon Secord was born to Wahnetta and Lowell Secord in Larue, Ohio on 6 July 1932. Two younger siblings, Sandra and Jim, were born in the next five years. Laura Secord was one of the ancestors in their family tree. Because they were poor, Lowell Secord taught his eldest son to use firearms for hunting for food from an early age.Secord, Wurts, p. 9. Lowell Secord was envious of a childhood friend who had graduated from West Point. To his son, he harped on the benefits of being paid to attend college, and the honor of a military career. Though Lowell moved to Marion, Ohio to become a welder as World War II began, he knew he had not improved his finances enough to afford to send a child to college. Young Richard adopted the goal of attending the service academy.Secord, Wurts, p. 10. Lowell and Wahnetta divorced after the end of World War II. Wahnetta moved the children to Columbus, Ohio in search of better schools. Although her Quaker heritage opposed her to military academies, she also believed her son Richard should graduate from college. Despite her opposition, Richard gained admission to West Point on his second try, having narrowly failed mathematics on his first academic testing.Secord, Wurts, pp. 10-12. As the outbreak of the Korean War had decimated the Class of 1950, Secord's Class of 1955 underwent extraordinarily thorough combat training during his tenure. Secord fought, with limited success, on the academy's varsity boxing team for three years; on his coach's advice, he gave up the sport to evade possible damage to his eyesight.Secord, Wurts, pp. 14-15.

Military career =Training and early postings= Secord served as a flight instructor from 1956 to 1959 at Laredo Air Force Base, and from 1959 to 1961 as an instructor and operations officer at Tinker Air Force Base. During the latter assignment, he was posted to the University of Oklahoma to study for a master's degree in English Literature. While progressing to the point of needing only his thesis to gain his degree, he met and married his wife, Jo Ann.Secord, Wurts, pp. 22-24. In August 1961 he joined covert operations in what would become the 1st Air Commando Wing, remaining there until 1965. As part of Operation Farm Gate, the wing was the first American aviation unit assigned to Vietnam. Secord flew over 200 combat missions between March 1962 to January 1963, flying AT-28s. One of the Vietnamese pilots he met during this assignment was Nguyen Cao Ky, later the president of Vietnam. Another new acquaintance there was Brigadier General Harry \\"Heinie\\" Aderholt. Also during this time, Secord was temporarily assigned to the Imperial Iranian Air Force as an adviser (January to July 1963, January to May 1964, January to March 1965).Secord, Wurts, pp. 24-52. VNAF AT-28s of the Vietnam Air Force. Secord flew 200+ combat missions in these planes while training Vietnamese pilots. After graduating from the Air Command and Staff College in 1966, Secord returned to Vietnam as an air operations officer, before being transferred to Thailand's Udorn Royal Thai Air Force Base in August 1966. Belatedly promoted to major, he joined Operation Waterpump to train the Royal Lao Air Force. During this time Secord was detailed to the Central Intelligence Agency to serve in the Secret War in Laos. He worked for, and knew, Ted Shackley and Thomas Clines; he worked directly with the CIA officers supplying the Secret War in Laos, James William Lair and Lloyd C. \\"Pat\\" Landry.Secord, Wurts, pp. 56-60. On 7 January 1967, in what is still a heavily classified operation, Secord directed the only successful prisoner of war rescue of the Vietnam War, the Ban Naden raid. A team of the CIA's hill-tribe mercenaries was inserted out of hearing of the POW prison; their surprise raid quickly wiped out about 40 guards. It was then discovered there were about twice as many prisoners as expected. Nevertheless, a scratch force of nine single-piloted Air America H-34 helicopters dropped into the middle of the H·ªì Ch√≠ Minh Trail and rescued 53 Asian prisoners. This rescue is still used as a case study in CIA training for covert operations.Secord, Wurts, pp. 66-70.Christianson, p. 231. Secord's responsibilities as a one-man logistics and operations staff covered a wide range of duties. One of the first duties he assumed was defense of Lima Site 85. In early 1967, General Hunter Harris briefed Secord and Lair on the upgrading of the TACAN installation there with guidance radar. The location, nearly on the Lao border with northern Vietnam, would enable American strike aircraft to follow its radar beam to Hanoi or Vinh and drop their bombs blind, regardless of weather. Lair and Secord were tasked with defense of the site. Despite their best efforts, this site would be overrun in March 1968. Secord requested additional protection for the technicians. Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who supervised the war in Laos by presidential directive, denied the need for stationing Green Berets at the site, or for personal weaponry. However, Secord insubordinately issued small arms to the onsite technicians for self-defense.Secord, Wurts, pp. 74-92. Having flown 285 combat missions in Southeast Asia,Lawrence Walsh, Final Report of the Independent Counsel for Iran/Contra Matters, Chapter 9: United States v. Richard V. Secord Secord mulled resigning from the USAF. General Aderholdt convinced him to reconsider. During Secord's next posting, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel ahead of his peers.Secord, Wurts, pp. 97-98. Secord served at Eglin Air Force Base from September 1968 to November 1969, as assistant deputy chief of staff for operations for the Tactical Air Command, in what would later become the U.S. Air Force Special Operations Force. From there, he transferred to serve as commanding officer of the 603rd Special Operations Squadron. His three years in command of the 603rd was focused on development of the A-37 Dragonfly for counter-insurgency; however, the 603rd was disbanded in June 1971. Secord moved on, to attend the Naval War College in August 1971.Secord, Wurts, pp. 98-101. =Command and staff assignments= Secord graduated from the Naval War College in June 1972. He then moved to Washington, D.C., serving in various capacities in the United States Department of Defense. His initial assignment was desk officer for Laos, Thailand and Vietnam under the Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs. While serving in this post, Secord claims to have been involved in planning the Christmas bombing of North Vietnam.Secord, Wurts, pp. 102-109. During this period, on 1 April 1973, he was promoted to colonel far ahead of his contemporaries.Secord, Wurts, p. 102. Following that assignment, he assumed the position of Executive Assistant to the Director of the Defense Security Assistance Agency in July 1973. Secord then was the USAF Chief of the Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) in Iran from September 1975 to July 1978. The new posting mandated a promotion to brigadier general.Secord, Wurts, pp. 117-119. In his new capacity he managed all USAF military assistance programs in Iran as well as some US Navy and Army programs, and acted as chief adviser to the Commander-in-Chief of the Iranian Air Force. Secord claims that despite endemic corruption in Iran, his MAAG was able to rebate to the Iranian government about $50 million from the Grumman Corporation.Secord, Wurts, p. 122. During this time he also oversaw Project Dark Gene and Project Ibex.Secord, Wurts, p. 131. After William H. Sullivan was appointed ambassador, Secord again found himself clashing with the diplomat over the use of U. S. military personnel and civilian technicians.Secord, Wurts, pp. 133-135. Returning to Washington, D.C. in July 1978, Secord served at Headquarters U.S. Air Force as director of international programs. Secord's official biography states that he was the ranking US Air Force officer for Operation Eagle Claw, the April 1980 attempt to end the Iran hostage crisis. However, in his autobiography, Secord denies involvement with Eagle Claw. He does give some details of his involvement with Operation Credible Sport, the planned second rescue raid to rescue the American hostages in Iran that was aborted by the hostages' release.Secord, Wurts, pp. 148-163. In his final military assignment, Secord was Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Security Affairs with responsibility for Near Eastern, African and South Asian affairs, from April 1981 to May 1983. While holding these two appointments, Secord continued to be involved in covert operations, though at a high level. He was instrumental in the controversial sale of early warning aircraft to Saudi Arabia.Secord, Wurts, pp. 168-174. Secord retired from the Air Force in 1983 after allegations of improper dealings with former CIA agent Edwin P. Wilson. Secord noted that the Reagan administration did not supply him with legal help when he was accused of shady dealings with Wilson. An unindicted Secord went $22,000 in debt for legal representation in conjunction with the Wilson matter, despite serving as a government witness in court against Wilson. The latter never mentioned during trial Secord's participation in any of Wilson's activities. Pentagon service being unhealthy for Secord was another factor in his retirement; he had recently survived three cases of pneumonia in as many years.Secord, Wurts, pp. 184-197. Retirement =Involvement in Iran‚ÄìContra affair= Operation Tipped Kettle was a precursor to the Iran-Contra logistics operation. Sources are not explicit about the dates of Secord's involvement, but it seems he may have carried over this project from his military service into his retirement. Operation Tipped Kettle, transferred Palestinian Liberation Organization weapons seized by Israel in Lebanon to the Contras.Amir Oren, Haaretz, 26 November 2010, The truth about Israel, Iran and 1980s U.S. arms deals To stay active during retirement, Secord went into business with Albert Hakim, becoming President of Stanford Technology Trading Group Intl., also known as \\"The Enterprise\\", a company involved with arms sales to Iran during the Reagan presidency. The final report of Iran/Contra Independent Counsel Lawrence Walsh concluded that Secord had received at least $2m from his involvement in these activities, and had lied to Congress about it. On November 8, 1989, Secord pleaded guilty to one count of lying to Congress as part of a plea agreement. http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-11-09/news/8901290516_1_contra-iran- arms-sales-gen-richard-secord He was sentenced to two years probation after pleading guilty to one count in a plea agreement. https://mobile.nytimes.com/1990/01/25/us/secord-is-put-on-probation-for-lie- on-iran-contra-role.html In the aftermath Secord filed a libel case against Leslie Cockburn, Andrew Cockburn, Morgan Entrekin, Atlantic Monthly Press, and Little, Brown and Company, Inc. for publishing a book in 1987 entitled Out of Control: The Story of the Reagan Administration's Secret War in Nicaragua, the Illegal Pipeline, and the Contra Drug Connection. Entrekin, Atlantic Monthly Press, and publishers Little, Brown and Company were dropped from the suit. The court then ordered summary judgment on behalf of the defendants Leslie Cockburn and Andrew Cockburn, indicating that Secord was unable to show the defendants had malicious intent. =Later retirement= In 1989, Secord was charged and convicted of drunk driving in Fairfax County, VA. https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1989/06/16/secord-charged- with-drunk-driving/8093469a-4e57-4e76-bf86-549963cc32ee/ In early 1992, Secord and another retired officer Brig. Gen. Harry Aderholt visited the newly independent former Soviet Republic of Azerbaijan on behalf of MEGA Oil, a company established by retired U.S. military officers. Secord reportedly offered to Azerbaijani leaders to train its special operations forces for $10 million.

Penned by Robert C. Cooper and directed by Martin Wood, the episode first aired on the American subscription channel Showtime on June 30, 2000. \\"Small Victories\\" resumes the story of the season 3 finale, \\"Nemesis\\", in which the SG-1 team encountered the Replicators for the first time. As the Replicators threaten Earth and the Asgard home galaxy, the team must split to master their job. \\"Small Victories\\" was another visual effects milestone for the series. The Replicators and the Asgard character Thor were computer-animated for parts of the episode. Some scenes were filmed in and outside of a Russian Foxtrot class submarine. \\"Small Victories\\" was nominated for Best Special Effects in 2001 for an Emmy, a Gemini Award and a Leo Award.  Plot  Confident that the destruction of Thor's starship has ended the Replicator threat to Earth (\\"Nemesis\\"), the SG-1 team returns home through the second Stargate that has been put up at Stargate Command. Shortly after they learn that a Russian Foxtrot class submarine has been hijacked by creatures whose descriptions match the Replicators, Thor arrives at Stargate Command and asks SG-1 for help against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy. As Colonel O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson), Daniel Jackson (Michael Shanks) and Teal'c (Christopher Judge) go to deal with the hijacked submarine, Major Carter (Amanda Tapping) goes with Thor. O'Neill, Daniel, and Teal'c try to obtain intelligence on the little self-replicating robotic invaders in the submarine, but they are forced to fall back. With Daniel's new theory that the Replicators are made up of the same materials they consume, the Replicators may be eliminated through sinking the iron submarine as long as the surviving Replicator from Thor's advanced ship is destroyed beforehand. Meanwhile, Carter witnesses a short battle against the Replicators in the Asgard galaxy during which five Asgard ships are lost. Carter notices the Replicators' attraction to new technology and proposes to use the O'Neill, an incomplete Asgard ship originally designed to fight the Replicators, as a lure to draw the Replicators into hyperspace and destroy them in the O'Neill's self- destruct. Thor eventually accepts the plan, the Replicators take the bait and are destroyed. Back on Earth, O'Neill and Teal'c penetrate the submarine and find and destroy the original Replicator. When the other Replicators take full control of the submarine, O'Neill orders the forces outside to destroy the submarine and prepares for the end, but Thor beams the team onto his ship before the explosion occurs. With the imminent Replicator threat over, Thor promises that when the Asgard defeat the Replicators, he will come to assist Earth in the war against the Goa'uld. Production =Writing and pre- production= Visual effects supervisor James Tichenor approached producer Robert C. Cooper after the completion of the season 3 finale, \\"Nemesis\\", and stated his confidence in his team's ability to create effects for a water- based episode. By that time, Cooper had already written the outline of \\"Small Victories\\" as the season 4 opener. \\"Small Victories\\" resumes the cliffhanger ending of \\"Nemesis\\" and alludes to events of that episode several times. The episode begins aboard a Russian submarine where one Russian says in his mother tongue that the noise in the torpedo tube might be caused by \\"one of the bugs from the other episode\\", an in-joke that the producers intentionally left without subtitles. Daniel Jackson's appendicitis attack from \\"Nemesis\\" is picked up, which was originally based on Michael Shanks' real-life appendicitis attack during the filming of the penultimate season 3 episode. \\"Small Victories\\" also continues building the relationship of O'Neill and Carter in mirroring a similar scene from \\"Nemesis\\". However, Christopher Judge, who in previous seasons sported a bald-shaven head as the alien Teal'c, returned to the set with a small blond chin beard after the hiatus, as the producers had not allowed his character to have scalp hair (until season 8). Judge shaved off the beard several episodes later after acknowledging its look as silly. The official Showtime website initially caused some confusion by listing Jay Acovone (Kawalsky) as a guest-star in this episode, which later turned out to be untrue. =Filming= Foxtrot-class submarine B-39, seen here in 2007. \\"Small Victories\\" was filmed over the course of seven days like most SG-1 episodes. After the first three seasons of Stargate SG-1 had been filmed on 16 mm film (except for shots incorporating visual effects, where experience had shown 35 mm to work better), \\"Nemesis\\" was filmed entirely on 35 mm film as a test run, and season 4 switched to the new gauge for all filming purposes. Martin Wood directed \\"Small Victories\\" and made a short cameo appearance with Sergeant Siler (stunt coordinator Dan Shea) in an SGC corridor. Andy Mikita served as the second unit director and filmed the coverage of the practical Thor puppet after Amanda Tapping's coverage had been shot. Michael Shanks, who provided the voice of Thor in post-production ADR, read some of Thor's lines for Tapping on-set. The top lip of the Thor puppet, which was visibly broken during the filming, proved a challenge. One anecdotal blooper moment that Amanda Tapping often tells at conventions and which producer Joseph Mallozzi named one of his favorites in the first five years of Stargate SG-1, is that of the puppeteers raising Thor's hand to touch Tapping's behind during filming. Tapping instinctively slapped the expensive prop, then she kneeled down and apologized to the puppet in all seriousness before realizing the silliness of her reaction. \\"Small Victories\\" is split into two parallel storylines, and several space shots of the B story onboard Thor's spaceship were cut at the script stage to allot more money to the A story submarine scenes. \\"Small Victories\\" was originally written to set on a fishing trawler until the producers got access to the decommissioned Russian Foxtrot-class submarine B-39, which was brought from Vladivostok to Vancouver Island in 1996. Several scenes were filmed in and outside of the submarine for two days. A matching set with removable walls was built later on because only three film crew members could fit into the real 25-feet-wide submarine. To enhance the submarine's narrowness, Martin Wood lit the ship with the actors' helmet lights and chose an agitated shooting style, holding the shots tight and handholding some of the cameras himself. The logistics of the submarine filming proved difficult and time-consuming, since the computer-generated Replicators needed to appear on Daniel's playback monitors in advance of filming. One scripted scene in which a Replicator piece is removed from Teal'c's shoulder was trimmed on-set because the actors felt it to be redundant. =Effects= \\"Small Victories\\" surpassed \\"Nemesis\\" as the biggest visual-effects-heavy Stargate SG-1 episode and remained one of biggest visual effects works of the season. Nevertheless, the limited budget required the major Computer-generated imagery (CGI) moments to be chosen well. The opening sequence of the Asgard ship flying over the ocean until its crash into the water was completely computer-generated, as was the Asgard homeworld at a later point in the episode. The finetuning of the lighting of the Asgard homeworld, which was blended with a matte painting of Asgard space ships in the sky, was the most difficult job. To save costs, the moments before Thor's entry to the SGC were stockshots of the Stargate, and the illusion of a Stargate event horizon behind Thor in the following scenes was created with an LCD projection. Although a computer-generated version of Thor was built around the puppet for independent movements, the CGI version's walking down the Stargate ramp was intercut with filmed shots of the puppet put on a trike. Visual effects producer James Tichenor claimed that visual effects work better when not highlighted, and that a major part of effective visual effects are the actors' reactions to nonexistent things. Replicator models were used to give the actors an idea at what they were looking and to match their eyelines. One model was mounted on a plexiglass rod and shown on-screen, giving the impression of an organic Replicator hologram. The computer-generated Replicators on board the submarine were tracked with small lights, some of which post-production left in for good looks. The reflections of the green screen on the floor aboard Thor's ship (\\"green spill\\", usually an undesired side effect) were used to key selective patches for the reflection of the big spaceship screen. Reception \\"Small Victories\\" was first broadcast on June 30, 2000 on Showtime. SG-1 visual effects producer James Tichenor considered the few episodes with big visual effects budgets the most likely works to contain visual cues that impress Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (Emmy Awards) voters, but he feared that the 2000 submarine feature film U-571 might spoil expectations. \\"Small Victories\\" and the SG-1 season 4 finale \\"Exodus\\" were nominated for a 2001 Emmy in the category \\"Outstanding Special Visual Effects for a Series\\", but they lost to Star Trek: Voyager's \\"Endgame\\". \\"Small Victories\\" was also nominated for a Gemini Award and a Leo Award in the respective \\"Best Visual Effects\\" categories, but failed to win either. In his book Approaching the Possible, Jo Storm considered \\"Small Victories\\" \\"one of the most enthralling episodes\\" that makes the audience forget that it used nearly the same premise that was used in \\"Nemesis\\". He thought the episode was \\"especially big on the Sam/Jack dynamic\\" as the characters \\"toe the line between fraternal teasing and downright chemistry\\". He saluted Amanda Tapping's comedic opportunities and called her character's reaction to Asgard food \\"priceless\\". He also noted the character development of Daniel Jackson in a military environment, contrasting it with the character's attitude in the season 1 episode \\"Thor's Hammer\\" where his military mind was less developed.

It is a capital of a separate commune within Krosno County. Ryman√≥w is situated in the heartland of the Do≈Çy (Pits) valley, and its average altitude is above sea level, although there are some hills located within the confines of the town.  History  815px The town was built by the Duke of Silesia W≈Çadys≈Çaw of Opole, the local representative of king Louis I of Hungary. Initially the town was named Ladisslavia, after the founder, and was inhabited primarily by settlers of central Germany (Reimannshau), largely overpopulated in late Middle Ages. In 1376 the town received a city charter based on the Magdeburg Law, which granted the town with a significant level self-government. During the reign of Ladislaus I of Poland the town received the modern name of Ryman√≥w, after the first w√≥jt Nicolao Reymann. The town was located on the traditional trade routes leading through the Carpathians to Hungary and in the 15th and 16th centuries it received numerous privileges from various Polish monarchs. This created a boost for local economy, mostly centred on the weekly fairs organized there. The period of prosperity ended in the 17th century, when this part of Poland was repeatedly pillaged and plundered by the invading armies during the wars against Muscovy, Sweden, Turkey and the Khmelnytsky Uprising. Throughout the ages, the town's history was interwoven with the fate of several notable Polish szlachta families. In 17th and 18th century the town was a private property of the Stadnicki family. In 1731 Teresa Stadnicka married J√≥zef Kanty Ossoli≈Ñski and the town passed to the mighty Ossoli≈Ñski family, notable for their collections of books and pieces of art. The latter started the construction of an exceptional parochial church, finished by his daughter Anna Teresa. The latter in 1794 sold the town to Potocki family, who owned it until the 20th century. Saint Lawrence Catholic Church The town since the 16th century had also a significant Jewish population, a synagogue is already mentioned in 1593, during a criminal trial at the castle court in Sanok.Oswald Balzer, Regestr z≈Çoczy≈Ñc√≥w grodu sanockiego, 1554-1638 (Lw√≥w, 1891), pp. 107-108 The local 17th century Bejt-ha-kneset synagogue is one of the exceptional examples of unusual fortified Jewish houses of prayer, used both for religious and military purposes. The local kirkut (established in the 16th century) survived World War II and currently features ca. 800 graves. Among them are tombs of some of the most renown local Jews, including tsadikkim Menachem Mendl, Cwi Hirsch, J√≥zef Friedman and cantor Israel Schorr. There is also a small military cemetery for Jewish soldiers who perished in the fights for the town in 1914 and 1915. Cinema In the 19th century, after the partitions of Poland, the town was annexed by Austria and was made part of the Austrian-ruled Galicia. Initially a part of the Land of Sanok of the Ruthenian Voivodeship, in 1772 it became a part of the Circle of Lesko and in 1864 back to the starostship of Sanok. The town's economy gradually got back on track as it became a local centre of foodstuffs trade for the local peasants. In 1872 the town became the property of Stanis≈Çaw Potocki and his wife Anna Dzia≈Çy≈Ñska, who started to develop a local spa. Much like the nearby town of Iwonicz Zdr√≥j, Ryman√≥w quickly developed into a popular resort for the inhabitants of Lw√≥w. With the beginning of oil industry in nearby Borys≈Çaw, a new railway was built only half a mile from the city. This further boosted the local development. In 1898 the town had 3704, including 1889 Poles and 1751 Jews. It had a post office, train station, telegraph and a gymnasium. However, after the outbreak of World War I the town was captured by the Russian Empire in September 1914 and severely looted. The spa pavillons were burnt to the ground and the town suffered from several weeks of Russian rule. In 1915 it was again retaken by Austria-Hungary and started to be rebuilt. After Poland regained her independence in 1918, the town was restored to Poland. However, 20 years afterwards the town was again damaged, this time during the German terror bombings during the Polish Defensive War. fter the Polish defeat, a prisoner of war camp was set up in the town's vicinity. Up to 10,000 Soviet prisoners were killed there by the Germans. The camp served also as a transit camp for the Jewish population. During the German occupation, the Germans immediately robbed and terrorized Ryman√≥w's Jewish population of around 1400. They were forced into a ghetto near the center of town, living with other refugees from neighboring towns, and some were forced into the prisoner of war camp. In August 1942, about 200 men were sent to labor camps, while many women, children, and the ill were rounded up and shot on the spot. The elderly were taken to the woods near Dukla and shot there. The rest were loaded on trains and sent to Belzec where they were murdered. The 400 or so Jews who survived the war were mostly those who fled to the Soviet Union when the Germans invaded though some were hidden locally by Christian acquaintances. The mass murder actions were typical of the fate of Jews in Polish towns and villages during the Holocaust except that many more of Rymanow's Jews survived than was typical.

The final three months of the conflict escalated to become the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, with United States forces being deployed in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Philippine Islands against Spain. Historians disagree as to the extent that United States officials were motivated to intervene for humanitarian reasons but agree that yellow journalism exaggerated atrocities attributed to Spanish forces against Cuban civilians. Background During the years 1869‚Äì1888 of the so-called \\"Rewarding Truce\\", lasting for 17 years from the end of the Ten Years' War in 1878, there were fundamental social changes in Cuban society. With the abolition of slavery in October 1886, freedmen joined the ranks of farmers and the urban working class. The economy could no longer sustain itself with the shift and changes; therefore, many wealthy Cubans lost their property, and joined the urban middle class. The number of sugar mills dropped and efficiency increased: only companies, and the most powerful plantation owners, remained in business followed by the Central Board of Artisans in 1879, and many more across the island.Navarro (1998). History of Cuba. Havana. pp. 55‚Äì57 After his second deportation to Spain in 1878, Jos√© Mart√≠ moved to the United States in 1881. There he mobilized the support of the Cuban exile community, especially in Ybor City (Tampa area) and Key West, Florida. His goal was revolution in order to achieve independence from Spain. Mart√≠ lobbied against the U.S. annexation of Cuba, which was desired by some politicians in both the U.S. and Cuba. After deliberations with patriotic clubs across the United States, the Antilles and Latin America, \\"El Partido Revolucionario Cubano\\" (The Cuban Revolutionary Party) was in a state of pendency and was affected by a growing fear that the U.S. government would try to annex Cuba before the revolution could liberate the island from Spain.Foner, Philip: The Spanish‚ÄìCuban‚ÄìAmerican War and the Birth of American Imperialism quoted in: , History of Cuba A new trend of aggressive U.S. \\"influence\\" was expressed by Secretary of State James G. Blaine's suggestion that all of Central and South America would some day fall to the U.S.: > \\"That rich island\\", Blaine wrote on 1 December 1881, \\"the key to the Gulf of > Mexico, is, though in the hands of Spain, a part of the American commercial > system‚Ä¶ If ever ceasing to be Spanish, Cuba must necessarily become American > and not fall under any other European domination\\".Spanish‚ÄìCuban‚ÄìAmerican War > ‚Äì History of Cuba Blaine's vision did not allow the existence of an independent Cuba. \\"Mart√≠ noticed with alarm the movement to annex Hawaii, viewing it as establishing a pattern for Cuba‚Ä¶\\" War On December 25, 1894, three ships ‚Äì the Lagonda, the Almadis and the Baracoa ‚Äì set sail for Cuba from Fernandina Beach, Florida, loaded with soldiers and weapons. Two of the ships were seized by US authorities in early January, but the proceedings went ahead. Not to be dissuaded, on March 25, Mart√≠ presented the Manifesto of Montecristi, which outlined the policy for Cuba's war of independence: * The war was to be waged by blacks and whites alike; * Participation of all blacks was crucial for victory; * Spaniards who did not object to the war effort should be spared, * Private rural properties should not be damaged; and * The revolution should bring new economic life to Cuba. The insurrection began on February 24, 1895, with uprisings all across the island. In Oriente, the most important ones took place in Santiago, Guant√°namo, Jiguan√≠, San Luis, El Cobre, El Caney, Alto Songo, Bayate, and Baire. The uprisings in the central part of the island, such as Ibarra, Jag√ºey Grande, and Aguada, suffered from poor coordination and failed; the leaders were captured, some of them deported and some executed. In the province of Havana, the insurrection was discovered before it was underway, and authorities detained its leaders. The insurgents further west in Pinar del R√≠o were ordered by rebel leaders to wait. On April 1 and 11, 1895, the main Mambi leaders landed on two expeditions in Oriente: Major General Antonio Maceo along with 22 members near Baracoa, and Jos√© Mart√≠, M√°ximo G√≥mez and 4 other members in Playitas. Around that time, Spanish forces in Cuba numbered about 80,000, of which 20,000 were regular troops and 60,000 were Spanish and Cuban volunteer militia. The latter were a locally enlisted force that took care of most of the \\"guard and police\\" duties on the island. Wealthy landowners would \\"volunteer\\" a number of their slaves to serve in this force, which was under local control as militia and not under official military command. By December, Spain had sent 98,412 regular troops to the island, and the colonial government increased the Volunteer Corps to 63,000 men. By the end of 1897, there were 240,000 regulars and 60,000 irregulars on the island. The revolutionaries were far outnumbered. The Mambises were named after the Spanish officer, Juan Ethninius Mamby who joined the Dominican fight for independence in 1844. The Spanish soldiers referred to the insurgents in the Dominican Republic as \\"the men of Mamby\\" or \\"Mambies\\". When Cuba's first war of independence broke out in 1868, some of those same soldiers were assigned to Cuba; they brought along what had by then become a derogatory Spanish slur for insurgents. The Cubans adopted the name with pride. After the Ten Years' War, the government had forbidden possession of weapons by private individuals. From the beginning of the uprising, the rebels were hampered by the lack of suitable weapons. They compensated by using guerrilla-style fighting, based on quick raids and fades to the environment, the element of surprise, mounting their forces on fast horses, and using machetes against regular troops on the march. They acquired most of their weapons and ammunition in raids on the Spaniards. Between June 11, 1895, and November 30, 1897, out of sixty attempts to bring weapons and supplies to the rebels from outside the country, only one succeeded. Twenty-eight ships were intercepted within U.S. territory; five were intercepted at sea by the U.S. Navy, and four by the Spanish Navy; two were wrecked; one was driven back to port by storm; the fate of another is unknown. Mart√≠ was killed shortly after landing on May 19, 1895, at Dos Rios, but M√°ximo Gomez and Antonio Maceo fought on, taking the war to all parts of Oriente. By the end of June, all of Camag√ºey was at war. Based on new research in Cuban sources, historian John Lawrence Tone demonstrated that Gomez and Maceo were the first to force the civilian forces to choose sides. \\"Either they relocated to the east side of the islands, where the Cubans controlled the mountainous terrain, or they would be accused of supporting the Spanish and be subject to immediate trial and execution.\\" Continuing west, they were joined by 1868 war veterans, such as Polish internationalist General Carlos Roloff and Seraf√≠n S√°nchez in Las Villas, who brought weapons, men and experience to the revolutionaries' arsenal. In mid- September, representatives of the five Liberation Army Corps assembled in Jimaguay√∫, Camag√ºey to approve the \\"Jimaguay√∫ Constitution.\\" They established a central government, which grouped the executive and legislative powers into one entity named \\"Government Council\\", headed by Salvador Cisneros and Bartolom√© Mas√≥. After some time of consolidation in the three eastern provinces, the liberation armies headed for Camag√ºey and then Matanzas, outmaneuvering and deceiving the Spanish Army several times. They defeated Spanish Gen. Arsenio Mart√≠nez-Campos y Ant√≥n, who had gained victory in the Ten-Year War, and killed his most trusted general at Peralejo. Campos tried the same strategy he had employed in the Ten Years' War, constructing a broad belt across the island, called the trocha, about 80 km long and 200 m wide. This defense line was to confine rebel activities to the eastern provinces. The belt was developed along a railroad from Jucaro in the south to Mor√≥n in the north. Campos built fortifications along this railroad at various points, and at intervals, 12 meters of posts and 400 meters of barbed wire. In addition, booby traps were placed at locations most likely to be attacked. The rebels believed they had to take the war to the western provinces of Matanzas, Havana and Pinar del Rio, where the island's government and wealth were located. The Ten-Year War had failed because it had not managed to proceed beyond the eastern provinces. In a successful cavalry campaign overcoming the trochas, the revolutionaries invaded every province. Surrounding all larger cities and well-fortified towns, they arrived at the westernmost tip of the island on January 22, 1896, exactly three months after the invasion near Baragu√°. Campos was replaced by Gen. Valeriano Weyler. He reacted to the rebels' successes by introducing terror methods: periodic executions, mass exile of residents and forced concentration of them in certain cities or areas, and destruction of farms and crops. Weyler's methods reached their height on October 21, 1896, when he ordered all countryside residents and their livestock to gather within eight days in various fortified areas and towns occupied by his troops. Death of Maceo in 1896 Hundreds of thousands of people had to leave their homes and were subjected to appalling and inhumane conditions in the crowded towns and cities. Together with the forced reconcentrations done by the rebels in the eastern provinces, Using a variety of sources, Tone estimates that civilian losses totaled 155,000 to 170,000 deaths, representing nearly 10 percent of the total population.Krohn, Jonathan. (May 2008) Review: \\"Caught in the Middle\\" John Lawrence Tone. War and Genocide in Cuba 1895‚Äì1898 (2006), H-Net, accessed 26 December 2014 Starting in the early 1880s, Spain had also suppressed an independence movement in the Philippines, which was intensifying. In effect, Spain was now fighting two wars, a heavy burden on its economy. In 1896 it turned down offers in secret negotiations by the United States to buy Cuba from Spain. Maceo was killed December 7, 1896, in Havana province while returning from the west. As the war went on, the major obstacle to Cuban success was weapons supply. Although weapons and funding came from within the Cuban exile community and supporters in the United States, the supply operation violated American laws. These were enforced by the U.S. Coast Guard: of 71 attempted re-supply missions, only 27 got through; 5 were stopped by the Spanish, but 33 were stopped by the U.S. Coast Guard. In 1897, the liberation army maintained a privileged position in Camag√ºey and Oriente, where the Spanish controlled only a few cities. Spanish Liberal leader Pr√°xedes Mateo Sagasta admitted in May 1897: \\"After having sent 200,000 men and shed so much blood, we don‚Äôt own more land on the island than what our soldiers are stepping on\\".Navarro, Jos√© Cant√≥n 1998. History of Cuba. Havana. p69 The rebel force of 3,000 defeated the Spanish in various encounters, such as the Battle of La Reforma, and forcing the surrender of Las Tunas on August 30. The Spaniards were kept on the defensive. Las Tunas had been guarded by over 1,000 well-armed and well- supplied men. As stipulated at the Jimaguay√º Assembly two years earlier, a second Constituent Assembly met in La Yaya, Camag√ºey, on October 10, 1897. The newly adopted constitution provided that military command was to be subordinated to civilian rule. The government was confirmed, naming Bartolom√© Mas√≥ President and Domingo M√©ndez Capote Vice President. Madrid decided to change its policy towards Cuba, and replaced Weyler. It also drew up a colonial constitution for Cuba and Puerto Rico, and installed a new government in Havana. But with half the country out of its control and the other half in arms, the colonial government was powerless and these changes were rejected by the rebels. The Maine incident Wreckage of the Maine, 1898 The Cuban struggle for independence had captured the American imagination for years. Some newspapers had agitated for US intervention, especially because of its large financial investment, and featured sensational stories of Spanish atrocities against the native Cuban population, which were exaggerated for propaganda. Such coverage continued after Spain had replaced Weyler and changed its policies. American public opinion was very much in favor of intervening on behalf of the Cubans. In January 1898, a riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists against the new autonomous government broke out in Havana. They destroyed the printing presses of four local newspapers that had published articles critical of Spanish Army atrocities. The U.S. Consul-General cabled Washington with fears for the lives of Americans living in Havana. In response, the battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in the last week of January. On February 15, 1898, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 260 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbor. At the time, a military Board of Investigations decided that the Maine had exploded due to the detonation of a mine underneath the hull. However, later investigations decided that it was likely something inside the ship, though the cause of the explosion has not been clearly established to this day. In an attempt to appease the United States, the colonial government took two steps that had been demanded by President William McKinley: it ended forced relocation of residents from their homes and offered negotiations with the independence fighters. But the truce was rejected by the rebels. The Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War Maine! And Don't Forget the Starving Cubans!\\" The sinking of the Maine sparked a wave of public indignation in the United States. Newspaper owners such as William R. Hearst leaped to the conclusion that Spanish officials in Cuba were to blame, and they widely publicized the conspiracy. Realistically, Spain could have had no interest in drawing the United States into the conflict.Navarro, Jos√© Cant√≥n: History of Cuba, Havana, Cuba, 1998, p. 71 Yellow journalism fueled American anger by publishing \\"atrocities\\" committed by Spain in Cuba. Hearst, when informed by Frederic Remington, whom he had hired to furnish illustrations for his newspaper, that conditions in Cuba were not bad enough to warrant hostilities, allegedly replied, \\"You furnish the pictures and I'll furnish the war\\". President McKinley, Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed, and the business community opposed the growing public demand for war, which was lashed to fury by the yellow journalism. The American cry of the hour became, Remember the Maine, To Hell with Spain! The decisive event was probably the speech of Senator Redfield Proctor, delivered on March 17, 1898, analyzing the situation and concluding that war was the only answer. The business and religious communities switched sides, leaving McKinley and Reed almost alone in their opposition to the war.Offner 1992 pp. 131‚Äì35 \\"Faced with a revved up, war-ready population, and all the editorial encouragement the two competitors could muster, the United States jumped at the opportunity to get involved and showcase its new steam-powered Navy\\". On April 11, McKinley asked Congress for authority to send American troops to Cuba for the purpose of ending the civil war there. On April 19, Congress passed joint resolutions (by a vote of 311 to 6 in the House and 42 to 35 in the Senate) supporting Cuban independence and disclaiming any intention to annex Cuba, demanding Spanish withdrawal, and authorizing the president to use as much military force as he thought necessary to help Cuban patriots gain independence from Spain. This was adopted by resolution of Congress and included the Teller Amendment, named after Colorado Senator Henry Moore Teller, which passed unanimously, stipulating that \\"the island of Cuba is, and by right should be, free and independent\\". The amendment disclaimed any intention on the part of the United States to exercise jurisdiction or control over Cuba for other than pacification reasons, and confirmed that the armed forces would be removed once the war is over. The amendment, pushed through at the last minute by anti-imperialists in the Senate, made no mention of the Philippines, Guam, or Puerto Rico. Congress formally declared war on April 25. The Senate and House passed the amendment April 19, McKinley signed the joint resolution on April 20, and the ultimatum was forwarded to Spain. War was declared on April 20/21, 1898. First hoisting of the Stars and Stripes by the US Marines on Cuban soil, June 11, 1898 \\"It's been suggested that a major reason for the U.S. war against Spain was the fierce competition emerging between Joseph Pulitzer's New York World and William Randolph Hearst's New York Journal\\". Joseph E. Wisan wrote in an essay titled \\"The Cuban Crisis As Reflected In The New York Press\\", published in \\"American Imperialism\\" in 1898: \\"In the opinion of the writer, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War would not have occurred had not the appearance of Hearst in New York journalism precipitated a bitter battle for newspaper circulation.\\" It has also been argued that the main reason the United States entered the war was its failed attempt to purchase Cuba from Spain. Hostilities started hours after the declaration of war when a contingent of US Navy ships under Admiral William T. Sampson blockaded several Cuban ports. The Americans decided to invade Cuba and to start in Oriente, where the Cubans had almost absolute control. They cooperated by establishing a beachhead and protecting the U.S. landing in Daiquiri. The first U.S. objective was to capture the city of Santiago de Cuba in order to destroy Linares' army and Cervera's fleet. To reach Santiago, the Americans had to pass through concentrated Spanish defences in the San Juan Hills and a small town in El Caney. Between June 22 and 24, 1898, the Americans landed under General William R. Shafter at Daiquir√≠ and Siboney, east of Santiago, and established a base. Battle of San Juan Hill The port of Santiago became the main target of naval operations. The U.S. fleet attacking Santiago needed shelter from the summer hurricane season, thus nearby Guant√°namo Bay, with its excellent harbor, was chosen for this purpose and attacked on June 6 (1898 invasion of Guant√°namo Bay). The Battle of Santiago de Cuba on July 3, 1898 was the largest naval engagement during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, resulting in the destruction of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron (Flota de Ultramar). Resistance in Santiago consolidated around Fort Canosa,Daley#, L. 2000. El Fortin Canosa en la Cuba del 1898. in Los Ultimos Dias del Comienzo. Ensayos sobre la Guerra Hispano-Cubana-Estadounidense. B.E. Aguirre and E. Espina eds. RiL Editores, Santiago de Chile pp. 161‚Äì71. All the while, major battles between Spaniards and Americans took place at Las Guasimas on June 24, El Caney and San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898, outside of Santiago.The Battles at El Caney and San Juan Hills , HomeOfHeroes.com. after which the American advance ground to a halt. Spanish troops successfully defended Fort Canosa, allowing them to stabilize their line and bar the entry to Santiago. The Americans and Cubans forcibly began a bloody, strangling siege of the city which eventually surrendered on July 16, after the defeat of the Spanish Caribbean Squadron. Thus, Oriente was under control of Americans, but U.S. General Nelson A. Miles would not allow Cuban troops to enter Santiago, claiming that he wanted to prevent clashes between Cubans and Spaniards. Thus, Cuban General Calixto Garc√≠a, head of the Mambi forces in the Eastern department, ordered his troops to hold their respective areas. He resigned over being excluded from entering Santiago, writing a letter of protest to General Shafter. Peace After losing the Philippines and Puerto Rico, which had also been invaded by the United States, and with no hope of holding on to Cuba, Spain opted for peace on July 17, 1898. On August 12, the United States and Spain signed a protocol of Peace, in which Spain agreed to relinquish all claims of sovereignty over Cuba. On December 10, 1898, the United States and Spain signed the Treaty of Paris, which demanded the formal recognition of Cuban independence on part of Spain. Although the Cubans had participated in the liberation efforts, the United States prevented Cuba from participating in the Paris peace talks and the signing of the treaty. The treaty did not set a designated time limit for U.S. occupation, and the Isle of Pines was excluded from Cuba.Navarro, Jos√© Cant√≥n: History of Cuba, Havana, Cuba, 1998, p. 77 The treaty officially granted Cuban independence, but U.S. General William R. Shafter refused to allow Cuban General Calixto Garc√≠a and his rebel forces to participate in the surrender ceremonies in Santiago de Cuba.

He was born in Monroe, Wisconsin and spent his working life in Warrenville and the Chicago area. Albright studied at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts (later the Art Institute of Chicago) and under Thomas Eakins, but also in Europe during the nineteenth century. Albright began as a landscape painter but moved to strongly foregrounding individuals in most of his paintings. A particular interest for his paintings was children. He painted in oils, using almost pastel tones and visible brush-strokes, creating realistic paintings that approached Impressionism in style. Themes portrayed by the man called the James Whitcomb Riley of the brush include country children at quiet play, at rest, and walking. Many country scenes were from the town of Warrenville and then-rural areas of what is now Chicago. In the early part of the twentieth century, Albright was an established Chicago-area artist, commanding $1,500 for a canvas and often serving on the jury for the annual Chicago and vicinity exhibition at the Chicago Art Institute. Later life Albright later married Clara Wilson Albright, and they had three sons, including twins Malvin, who became a sculptor, and Ivan, who became the most prominent Chicago artist of the time. Ivan was commissioned by MGM to create the portrait from the film, The Picture of Dorian Gray. Malvin also submitted a painting that was not used for the film. In 1924, Albright acquired a vacant church building on Second Street in Warrenville. He and his two sons operated the Albright Gallery of Painting and Sculpture. In 1981, the building was acquired by the city and after extensive renovations, it was converted into the Albright Studio museum by the Warrenville Historical Society. As an elderly man, Albright decided to sell his paintings on monthly installments to be paid as long as he lived, so that he would have an insured retirement income. Many people thought they would get his paintings at a very low price since he was already an old man, but his longevity served him well. He died at age 95 at his home in Warrenville.

The group was formed in 1987 by Peter Devin and Oliver B√ºttner (a.k.a. Dominik van Reich). Their name is derived from the name of Aleister Crowley, and their music reflects themes of dark magic, religious rituals, death, and violence. History The duo put out a number of demo tapes in 1988‚Äì1990 until they were finally signed to the now defunct Celtic Circle Productions (C.C.P.) recording label and released their first full-length CD album Brainstorming in 1993. Their music consists of gloomy synthesizers mixed with abrasive dance-beats, overlaid with distorted vocals and the occasional audio sample taken from various horror films. The musical result is a style akin to Skinny Puppy, that has inspired many other groups in the electro-industrial and gothic genres. In 1994, after what looked like a promising career, yelworC unexpectedly split up, with van Reich heading off to form the more experimental sounding amGod (\\"dogma\\" backwards) and cutting one album Half Rotten and Decayed under the C.C.P. label. Devin fought and successfully kept the rights to use the name yelworC. In 2004 Devin released a new studio album entitled Trinity; the first release from yelworC in over ten years. The album, containing some material composed during the late 1990s, is based on Dante's journey through Hell as told in the first part of The Divine Comedy, Inferno.

It was a short wheelbase version of the concurrent Australian Chrysler Valiant sedan. Introduced within the VH Valiant series, it continued as a variant through the subsequent VJ, VK and CL series, until production ceased in 1978. It was marketed and badged as the Valiant Charger in the VH and VJ series and as the Chrysler Charger in the later VK and CL series. While still based on the US Chrysler A-body platform, with virtually identical front suspension, the fenders were widened, and a wider rear axle fitted, so that the track, front and rear, was considerably wider than any US A-body, this also allowed wheels much wider than a US A-body. The Australian Chargers also used a 5-on-4.5\\" wheel bolt circle (still 7/16\\" studs), while the US cars did not go to \\"big bolt pattern\\" until 1973. The Charger was extraordinarily popular in Australia during the VH series. At one point Charger production totalled 80% of all Australian Valiant production. The VH Valiant Charger achieved critical acclaim, winning the 1971 Australian Wheels Car of the Year Award. It was also popular in New Zealand where they were assembled from imported kits. The sporty image of the Charger faded through the VJ range of cars and was neutered altogether by 1975 release of the VK series. During the seven years of production, the Charger carried many variations of essentially two basic powerplants, based on the Chrysler Hemi-6 Engine and versions of the Chrysler LA engine V8.  VH Valiant Charger  The Chrysler VH Valiant Charger range, introduced in 1971, consisted of Charger, Charger XL, Charger 770 and Charger R/T (Road/Track) models. The R/T version carried on Chrysler's performance image from the VG series Valiant Pacer, and soon became the platform for Chrysler's participation in production car racing in Australia. The range of cars was broad-based to appeal to all manner of people: * Charger: base engine (, 3spd manual, $2795.00 * Charger XL: base engine (, 3spd manual, $3195.00 * Charger R/T: HP base engine (, 3spd manual, $3395.00 * Charger R/T E38: HP base engine (, 3spd manual, $3975.00 * Charger R/T E49: HP base engine (, 4spd manual, $3975.00 * Charger 770: HP base engine (, 3spd automatic, $3625.00 * Charger 770: 2bbl V8 engine (, 3spd automatic, $4105.00 * Charger 770 SE E55: 4bbl V8 engine (, 3spd automatic, $4850.00 The Charger R/T option E37 featured a tuned \\"Six Pack\\" version of the engine characterised by triple sidedraught Weber carburettors, formed the basis of Chrysler's touring car racer for 1971. This engine could also be ordered as an option on all models The Charger R/T E49 engine produced remarkable torque on a seven bearing configuration which enabled considerable power development previously unobtained from 6-cylinder engines and not surpassed until the Porsche Turbo 911 (300) release of 1975 The Charger 770 SE (Special Edition) featured the E55 option; which was the 340ci 4bbl V8 engine, many motoring journalists correctly reported at the time as being imported by Chrysler for an aborted racing touring car homologation exercise. Chrysler Racing Manager John Ellis stated at the time that a ute fitted with the 340ci V8 (and the same wheelbase as the R/T Charger) was track tested at the Mallala circuit in South Australia by racing driver Leo Geoghegan (and on local roads by Leo and his brother Ian), but was found to be 2‚Äì3 seconds slower around Mallala than the E49 (the heavier V8 at the front caused severe understeer and required earlier braking than the Hemi six). Despite the slower lap times at Mallala, it was expected that the extra power of the 340ci V8 would have worked better on the long straights and uphill runs at Bathurst where there were few heavy braking or tight corners. John Ellis then incorrectly stated that the 340ci engines were not imported for Bathurst and that an R/T 340 Charger was not being considered. 336 340ci engines plus 4 speed gear boxes were imported by Colin Adey under direct instructions from Chrysler Chief Engineer Walt McPherson. Chrysler General Manager David Brown and Walt McPherson had discussed the short comings of the E49 265ci and decided the 340ci was to be the next R/T Touring Car. This information never filtered down to John Ellis. Due to bad press coverage at the time the 340ci program was aborted and Chrysler did the only thing it could do which was to recoup the cost outlay by selling the stocks of the imported 340ci engines. The engines were sold off in the upmarket 770 SE (Grand Tourer) Charger. The SE was fitted with an imported 'Torqueflite' 727 transmission, Chrysler further watered down engine performance by using a single pipe exhaust system. Apart from its unique engine, the Charger 770 SE featured other signature details such as combination black and white vinyl trim and one with single colour Maroon vinyl trim, turned metal dash facia, and it was only available in three body colours, namely Vintage Red (Bright Red), Limelight (green), and Sunfire (yellow metallic). Production records indicate that Chrysler manufactured a total of 125 VH Valiant Charger 770 SE cars, two of which varied from standard specification in being painted White and one Deep Maroon.  VJ Valiant Charger  Chrysler VJ Valiant Charger 770 (with Option E55) Chrysler VJ Valiant Charger Sportsman In March 1973 the VH range was superseded by the VJ series. The VJ featured changes to the cowl, grille, lighting and rear quarter feature panel, with notably 7\\" round headlights replacing the previous rectangular units. Significantly, this new model range saw the end of the Charger R/T, which pretty much coincided with Chrysler having officially withdrawn from participation in Australian touring car racing at the end of the 1972 season. However, the essential elements of the Six Pack E37 engine option were carried over into the VJ series, now referred to as the E48 engine option. * option E48: Street tune \\"Six Pack\\" engine with three two-barrel Weber carburettors and four-speed manual gearbox. * option E55: 4bbl V8 (1.88\\" valve heads). * option E57: 2bbl V8 (introduced late 1974 to replace E55 option) * option A23: VJ Charger Sportsman VJ Charger 770 (with option E55) When specified with the E55 340ci V8 engine option, such VJ-series cars were no longer tagged as a special edition Charger 770 \\"SE\\". This meant that a variety of colour and trim combinations are featured in E55 optioned VJ Chargers such that the only external distinguishing features were the \\"340 4BBL\\" badges on the front guards. Most, but not all, of the VJ-series E55 option cars also featured the W35 option seven inch wide alloy wheels that were a signature item for all prior E38, E49, and E55 option VH-series Chargers. There was an improvement to the motor in this model, as opposed to the previous VH-series. The introduction of \\"Electronic Ignition\\" replaced the use of points ignition. This greatly improved the car for normal use making cold starts easier, and no longer requiring the ignition to be tuned every 10,000 km or so. The Carter ThermoQuad was used in this series as well, however not from the start, or at least not all the cars left the factory with one. Some still had the previous models AVS carburettor. When the carburettor change was implemented is unknown, with some examples having the Thermoquad and later builds still keeping the AVS. There is considered to be an improvement to engine performance as the flow in the carburettor was increased from 625 cfm to 800 cfm for the Thermoquad. During this option's life, there were other engine variations, e.g. the motors also had a change in the cylinder heads. According to the service manuals, early VJ models maintained heads with 2.02\\" inlet valves, whereas later heads had a decrease in inlet valve size which saw a reduction to 1.88\\", again, when this was implemented is not truly known and some early build cars have the smaller valves whereas some later builds have the larger valves. It seems that most E55 versions of the VJ Charger were manufactured during the latter half of 1973. When remaining stocks of the V8 depleted, Chrysler ceased manufacturing cars with option E55 and in late 1974 extended availability of the lazy V8 (from the prestige Chrysler by Chrysler sedan) to the Charger 770 by way of option E57. VJ Charger Sportsman (option A23) In August 1974, a limited edition Charger Sportsman was released, based upon the Charger XL. Built to a quantity of 500 units, all Sportsman cars were painted an exclusive combination of Vintage Red and white, with a combination black and white interior featuring specific cloth trim. These cars were powered by the standard 265ci engine and four speed manual transmission.  VK Charger  Chrysler VK Charger 770 The mildly revised VK series Charger was released in October 1975 in only two variants:Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, pages 140‚Äì141 * Charger XL: , 3spd manual ( and litre engine options) * Charger 770: , 3spd manual (, V8 and V8 engine options) The introduction of the VK series saw the demise of the \\"Six Pack\\" engine E48 option package, such that only a basic specification engine remained. The Charger was now marketed as the Chrysler Charger rather than as the Chrysler Valiant Charger with Chrysler script badging having replaced Valiant badging front and rear. Some further changes with the VK model included 'white-out' grille treatment, revised rear light clusters, and revised 'C' pillar ornamentation utilising extended fibreglass panels in black, incorporating XL or 770 badge identification. Inside, wiper and windscreen washer controls were now integrated into the indicator stalk and there were also some trim revisions that included bold Boca-Raton cloth seat inserts for the Charger 770. In June 1976, ADR 27A (an updated emissions regulation) was implemented for all Australian market motor vehicles, which resulted in both the engine and the V8 engine being dropped from all relevant vehicles in Chrysler's VK series range. White Knight Special owned by Kevin Johnson-Bade VK Charger White Knight Special (option A50): Following July 1976, Chrysler released 200 limited edition Charger XL cars that were principally a cosmetic treatment inside and out, and featuring a front body spoiler. Half of the production run were painted Arctic White and the other half were painted Amarante Red, with bumpers and grille painted to match. These cars featured the six-cylinder engine, with a choice of manual or automatic transmission, and interiors were trimmed to a specific combination of white vinyl with red accents.  CL Charger  Chrysler CL Charger 770 The CL series Charger was introduced in late October 1976 and was the last Charger model made in Australia, it featured new front bodywork and was expected to be designated as the VL series, but Chrysler decided to rename it CL to reflect the corporate Chrysler name which was now being applied over the whole range of cars sold in Australia. The Charger XL variant was deleted (except for police duties) such that the CL series offered only the Charger 770 for public sale.Elisabeth Tuckey and Ewan Kennedy, Chrysler Valiant, 1996, page 165 CL Charger Drifter (A34, A49 options): Late in the life of the CL Charger, Chrysler introduced the Drifter Pack option which was made available in four body colour choices, namely Spinnaker White (A34), Impact Orange (A49), Sundance Yellow (A49), and Harvest Gold (A49). This was basically a cosmetic option inspired by features found on the Chrysler Drifter panel van. These cars were available in a choice of or engines, but only with 4-speed manual transmission. Chrysler's manufacturing production of the Charger ceased on 16 August 1978.  Motorsport  Leo Geoghegan's Chrysler VH Valiant Charger. The Valiant Charger was raced in Australia in an official capacity during 1971 and 1972, with most effort concentrated upon the series and the annual Bathurst 500 mile touring car event. Chrysler Australia employed the services of racing driver Leo Geoghegan to assist in the development of the Charger as a touring car racer. The Charger won the first race in which it was entered, the Toby Lee 100 at Oran Park, driven by Doug Chivas. In the 1972 Hardie-Ferodo 500 at Bathurst, a VH Charger R/T E49 driven by Doug Chivas placed third outright behind a Ford XY Falcon GTHO and a Holden Torana GTR XU-1. They were comprehensively beaten by the XY Falcon GTHO, lapping some 6 seconds per lap slower due to brake pad issues. A rumour exists, that the order from Sydney for the Chrysler team and others was allegedly misplaced on the Saturday night before Sunday's race. The rumour further claims that Holden and Ford played a hand, or teams of the two major makers in Australia, played a part. This has been substantiated by a Ford team member at the track.and Bib Stilwell, told the same story many years later, regardless Chrysler were unable to capitalise on the previous success,the car under developed at the time In New Zealand, where the touring car rules were less open, the Charger proved to be unbeatable from 1971 through to 1979 at the famous B&H; 500 mile (later 1000 km) series held at Pukekohe Park Raceway. The most successful of New Zealand drivers were Leo Leonard and Jim Little. Allan Moffat, driving the Ford XY Falcon GTHO, was comprehensively beaten by the Charger in New Zealand. Moffat proclaimed the winning car as \\"The Fastest Charger in the World\\".

Established in 1969 and located in the Kwai Chung district of the New Territories, the school consists of a , six-storey school building and a new wing which was opened in 2004. Facilities of the school include of 24 conventional class rooms, eleven special purpose rooms, an assembly hall that seats a thousand people, and a basketball court.  History  With the number of local school-age children increasing continuously, the late Reverend Peter Wong, former General Secretary of The Hong Kong Council of the Church of Christ in China, decided to build a new secondary school in Kwai Chung in response to rising demand for school vacancies. After much planning, an English-language secondary school was built and given the name of Chuen Yuen College, after other schools with the name of Chuen Yuen in the area. On 18 May 1969, the cornerstone was laid in a ceremony presided over by Professor Yung Chi-tung (ÂÆπÂïüÊù±), president of Chung Chi College, Chinese University of Hong Kong. The first classes were held that September. On 16 November, the school held a public dedication ceremony with Bishop Otto Nall. Initially, the school only offered the standard Chinese curriculum, but, starting in 1972, it allowed English education students to enroll. In 1973, the school added Hong Kong university preparatory classes and a math/science programme to its offerings. In 1974, it expanded to 24 different classes, offering a standard education program. Directives from Hong Kong's education administration requiring 9 years of free education for students led the school to expand its admissions in 1976, and in 1978, again in response to government directives, it began offering special education classes. However, in 1985 government funding changed and it began reducing its special education enrollments and increasing the number of ordinary classes. The school's founding headmaster, Mr Cheung Wan Cha (ÂºµÈõ≤Êßé), retired in 1983. Its second headmaster, Mrs Yau Oi Naam (ÈÇ±ËóπÊ•†), left the school in 1992. The third headmaster, Mrs Lei Sek Yuk Ru (ÊùéÁü≥ÁéâÂ¶Ç), returned to serve in her alma mater, the Ying Wa Girls' School (‰∏≠ËèØÂü∫Áù£ÊïôÊúÉËã±ËèØÂ•≥Ê†°), in Sept 2001; Mr Wong Wai Yiu (ÈªÉÂÅâËÄÄ) took over as the fourth (and current) headmaster.  Programmes offered and administration structure  The programme offered at Chuen Yuen is roughly the same as in other Hong Kong schools. Outside of the core subjects, it offers classes in fine arts and graphic design, music, home economics, industrial arts, computer skills, physical education and religion, in conformance with public needs. In recent years, it has added to its offerings Mandarin language classes and business administration, accounting theory, travel and tourism education and communications studies, in order to give students more choices. Since its opening, Chuen Yuen has been focusing on offering a holistic education and putting great emphasis on the moral development and spiritual needs of students. The school also encourages its students to participate in extracurricular activities via various programmes. The school is under the direction of an administrative council along with special committees for education, instructional services, extracurricular activities, religion, guidance counselling, citizenship and moral education, each responsible for the corresponding department and for improving standards in their respective fields. Furthermore, the school has special interest committees such as the information science and technology committee, the teacher training committee, and the parents' support and liaison committee. In 1994, the school also established an association of friends, parents and teachers of Chuen Yuen college. Trivia Guests who visit the school would sometimes mistake the name of the school for Yuen Chuen (Traditional Chinese:ÂÆåÂÖ®), which means utterness in Chinese.

Prima pratica (Italian, 'first practice') refers to early Baroque music which looks more to the style of Palestrina, or the style codified by Gioseffo Zarlino, than to more \\"modern\\" styles. It is contrasted with seconda pratica music. These terms are synonymous to stile antico and stile moderno, respectively. History Stile antico has been associated with composers of the high Baroque and early Classical periods of music, in which composers used controlled dissonance and modal effects and avoided overtly instrumental textures and lavish ornamentation, to imitate the compositional style of the late Renaissance. Stile antico was deemed appropriate in the conservative confines of church music, or as a compositional exercise as in J. J. Fux's Gradus Ad Parnassum (1725), the classic textbook on strict counterpoint. Much of the music associated with this style looks to the music of Palestrina as a model. The term prima pratica was first used during the conflict between Giovanni Artusi and Claudio Monteverdi about the new musical style.Palisca For 18th-century composers such as Johann Sebastian Bach, can refer to music composed as late as the early years of that century (e.g. by Antonio Lotti, Pietro Torri), a style Bach would imitate more frequently in his later compositions (starting in the 1730s, up to his death in 1750). =Monteverdi's era= In the early Baroque Claudio Monteverdi and his brother coined the term prima pratica to refer to the older style of Palestrina, and seconda pratica to refer to Monteverdi's music. At first, prima pratica referred only to the style of approaching and leaving dissonances. In his Seconda parte dell'Artusi (1603), Giovanni Artusi writes about the new style of dissonances, referring specifically to the practice of not properly preparing dissonances (see Counterpoint), and rising after a flattened note or descending after a sharpened note. In another book, his L'Artusi, overo Delle imperfettioni della moderna musica (1600) (\\"The Artusi, or imperfections of modern music\\") Artusi had also attacked Monteverdi specifically, using examples from his madrigal \\"Cruda Amarilli\\" to discredit the new style. Monteverdi responded in a preface to his fifth book of madrigals, and his brother Giulio Cesare Monteverdi responded in Scherzi Musicali (1607) to Artusi's attacks on Monteverdi's music, advancing the view that the old music subordinated text to music, whereas in the new music the text dominated the music. Old rules of counterpoint could be broken in service of the text. According to Giulio Cesare, these concepts were a hearkening back to ancient Greek musical practice. =18th‚Äì19th century= The great composers of the late Baroque all wrote compositions in the stile antico, especially Bach. His Mass in B minor has sections written in stile antico which contrast with up-to-date Baroque idioms. Later composers such as Haydn and Mozart also used stile antico. Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, written after the composer's study of Palestrina, is a late flowering of the style. Late Baroque For 18th-century composers such as Bach, can refer to music composed as late as the early years of that century, for example by Antonio Lotti and Pietro Torri. Bach's interest in this style grew in the 1730s, and in the last two decades of his life (1730s‚Äì1740s) he would write in this style more frequently, leading to an outspoken style shift in this composer's work around 1740.Neuaufgefundenes Bach-Autograph in Wei√üenfels at Classical era Romantic era References Sources * Stephen R.

Neville was a staple of the New Orleans music scene for over five decades. He was the founder of the funk band The Meters whose musical style set the tone of New Orleans funk, a co-founder of the rock-soul-jazz band The Neville Brothers, and he later formed the spinoff group The Funky Meters. He performed on many recordings by notable artists from New Orleans and elsewhere, including Labelle (on \\"Lady Marmalade\\"), Paul McCartney, Lee Dorsey, Robert Palmer, Dr. John and Professor Longhair. He was the recipient of three Grammy awards. Life and career Neville grew up in New Orleans. He was the son of Amelia (Landry) and Arthur Neville Sr. He started on piano and performed with his brothers at an early age. He was influenced by the R&B; styles of James Booker, Bill Doggett, Booker T. Jones, Lloyd Glenn and Professor Longhair. In high school he joined and later led The Hawketts. In 1954 the band recorded \\"Mardi Gras Mambo\\" with Neville on vocals. The song gained popularity and became a New Orleans carnival anthem. The band toured with Larry Williams. Neville performed regularly in New Orleans, joined the U.S. Navy in 1958, and returned to music in 1962. He released several singles as a lead artist in 1950s and 1960s. In early 1960s Neville formed the Neville Sounds. The band included Aaron Neville, Cyril Neville, George Porter, Leo Nocentelli, and Ziggy Modeliste. Shortly after, Aaron and Cyril left the group to form their own band. The remaining four members continued playing at the Nitecap and the Ivanhoe nightclubs. The band backed many notable artists such as Lee Dorsey, Betty Harris and The Pointer Sisters. The band had a strong sense of groove and unlike traditional groups each instrument was free to lead and go anywhere musically. Over time the band's style came to represent New Orleans funk. In the late 1960s the band changed its name to The Meters and released three instrumental albums. Early on, compositions were through live improvisation, however this changed in the early 1970s. The band gained notoriety in the rock music community including with musicians Paul McCartney, Robert Palmer and The Rolling Stones. The group released five more albums and disbanded in late 1970s due to financial, managerial and artistic factors. The band's musical style emphasized rhythm over melody and had a lasting impact on upcoming musical styles such as hip-hop as well as jam bands including Phish, Galactic and the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Art Neville (left) and George Porter Jr. of the Funky Meters at New Orleans Jazz & Heritage Festival 2004 In 1978 Neville and his brothers Cyril, Aaron and Charles formed The Neville Brothers. Previously, the brothers had worked on The Wild Tchoupitoulas album. The group's debut album, titled The Neville Brothers, was released in 1978. In 1981 music critic Stephen Holden wrote: the Neville Brothers' style of soul music combines \\"funk, doo-wop, reggae and salsa under the banner of New Orleans rhythm and blues\\". The group released several albums throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including Fiyo on the Bayou and Yellow Moon, and an album in 2004. During this period, Neville performed several shows with the original Meters bandmates including a 1989 reunion at the New Orleans Jazz Festival. Following that performance, Neville, Porter, Nocentelli and Russell Batiste formed The Funky Meters. The lineup changed in 1994 with Brian Stoltz replacing Nocentelli on guitar. Neville performed concurrently with both The Neville Brothers and The Funky Meters. In a 1995 interview, Neville spoke about the joy of live improvisation. He said \\"The best part, to me, is when the [rhythm] just evolves into some other stuff.\\" Neville received a Grammy in 1989 with The Neville Brothers for Best Pop Instrumental Performance. He received a Grammy in 1996 with various artists for Best Rock Instrumental Performance in \\"SRV Shuffle\\", a tribute to Stevie Ray Vaughan.

It is one of three large parklands around Havering-atte-Bower; the others are Havering Country Park and Pyrgo Park. Bedfords Park is a Site of Metropolitan Importance for Nature Conservation and a local nature reserve. It was awarded a Green Flag Award in 2007 which was maintained at least until 2013. The site is managed by Havering Council and the visitor centre is managed by the Essex Wildlife Trust. Geography Bedfords Park is situated on a south-facing slope, the top of which is 110 metres above sea level and affords views over east London and across the River Thames to Kent. The highest part of the park is on a ridge capped by a patch of Chalky Boulder Clay and it is this that allows the Round Pond to retain water. The park is made up of mixed parkland and deciduous woods and is much narrower on the ridge while broadening as you move down the slope in a southerly direction. Vehicular access is gained on the north side of the park from Broxhill Road, while there is pedestrian access from Lower Bedfords Road on the southern edge of the park, and also using a permissive footpath from Orange Tree Hill. History The land that makes up Bedfords Park originates in the two adjoining estates of Bedfords, believed to be named after the family of Robert de Bedford mentioned in 1285 and John Bedford who held the land in 1362, and Earls which later became known as Upper Bedfords. The latter was taken from John Derewin in 1212 by King John as forfeiture for homicide and given to William d'Aubigny, 3rd Earl of Arundel for the annual rent of one Sparrowhawk. The manor, which is one of the olderst in Havering and was one of four held in serjeanty, remained in the family at least until the time of the 5th Earl. In 1452 Thomas Cooke (who was to become Lord Mayor of London 10 years later) took possession of the manor of Bedfords, having already acquired the 'manor or messuage' of Earls, and held these as part of the Gidea Hall estate. This continued for 200 years until 1659 after which the properties changed hands several times, being briefly part of Gobions Manor, but by 1678 the two estates were held by Robert Wolley. After being sold out of Gobions Manor, the ownership was in the hands of various London merchants until 1771 when it was sold by Nathaniel Houlton to a Mr John Heaton. During this time there is no evidence of the owners living in either manor. Bedford Park's mansion John Heaton rebuilt the house at Bedfords as a two-storey brick mansion rendered with cement, and resided there until his death in 1818. Upper Bedfords (previously Earls) was also rebuilt during this time in a crenelated style, including a tower which has often caused it to be mistaken for a church. It was at this time (c. 1777) that the lane which had run from Broxhill Road to Lower Bedfords Road and going past Bedfords was closed by the owner. This is also the point at which today's park is recognisable as Chapman and Andre's survey of that time depicts the northern tree line, approach avenue, and park boundaries as they occur today. The property passed down two generations in the Heaton family, although it was let to tenants between 1826 and 1834. At this point the property again changed hands several times and was even listed in the Chelmsford Chronicle on 21 June 1867 (on page 4): Bedfords Park for sale - 1867 It was purchased 3 years later from the mortgagee of the previous owner by Henry R. Stone in 1870. His son Henry J. Stone was the last lord of the manor, and although in parts, Bedfords was sold to Romford Urban District Council by his widow in 1933. Romford UDC opened the park to the public in 1934, and instituted a museum in the house which locals seem to have referred to as Bedfords Mansion, this focussing on natural history and containing stuffed birds and animals from the local area. It was also around this time that a captive herd of red deer were introduced. During World War II Bedfords House was used by the Auxiliary Fire Service and afterwards was used as the council archive but was gradually allowed to fall into disrepair until it was demolished in 1959. In the 1960s a cafe was built on the site of the house until this also fell out of use in the 1980s. Bedfords Park Mansion - west-facing thumb Today the route of the public lane closed around 1777 can still be traced along the entrance drive, past the old stable block (the only part of the house to survive), and then down the slope to the east of the visitor centre, the whole being characterised by the avenue of mature Horse Chestnut trees. The site of the house is now occupied by a Visitor Centre run by Essex Wildlife Trust. Queen Anne's Oak Queen Anne's Oak c.1860 This was an ancient oak tree that stood to the side of the mansion and the deer enclosure. The above is the earliest known photograph of the oak tree where legend has it, Queen Anne sat by this tree on her visits to the estate. That is why the estate took this concerted effort to help keep the tree alive for so long; including bricking around the base of the tree and bracing it with metal belts. It is also mentioned in the Romford Then and Now publication from 2005 where it mentions: A new oak tree was planted on the actual site of the tree to commemorate its memory in 2015.

Students are allowed to wear the uniforms they wore during secondary school. The Provisional Admission Exercise (PAE), colloquially known as the first three months among Singapore students, refers to the interim exercise/period in which graduating Secondary 4 students in Singapore could choose to join a junior college or centralised institute for Term 1 in the following academic year, before the official release of the GCE 'O' level results. Students used the score of their respective secondary schools' internal preliminary examinations to apply under the programme.  Programme  Orientation programme held at the institute stadium of Millennia Institute in 2007. Most pre-university centres' orientation programmes during the PAE were longer as compared to those held at the start of the actual pre-university academic year. Students usually made use of this period of time to socialise and enjoy themselves; their workload was greatly reduced, and cases of skipping classes were common. This is in stark contrast to the pressure-cooker stress that students usually undergo during a normal school term. Junior colleges in Singapore also made use of this period to organise many activities, with fun as an emphasis, in order to entice students to stay in their respective institutions after the PAE. This is particularly true if the junior college is not prominent for its academic-orientated performance. Break in the canteen during PAE 2007; PAE-admitted students wearing their secondary school uniforms. During the PAE, students were permitted to wear uniforms of their secondary schools instead of those of the pre-university centre. The phenomenon of gate-crashing, or colloquially called crashing, arose from this loophole; in an act amounting to trespassing, students not affiliated to a school enter without prior consent from the school administration. Some students gatecrashed to enjoy the prestige of crashing a \\"good\\" pre-university centre; others did so to join their former schoolmates. It was also common to see students from different secondary schools exchanging their school uniforms with those from schools considered more recognised, mostly for the fun of it or in some cases, to escape the \\"neighbourhood school\\" stigma presented by their uniforms. Critics claim that some secondary schools give an unfair advantage over their students, by either inflating grades for the internal preliminary examinations or making them easier. Students who choose to remain in the JCs after the PAE are awarded bonus 'loyalty' scores, which cuts off 2 points in their GCE 'O' Level grade, giving them a greater chance of remaining in the pre-university centre. However, the option to reduce one's score by 2 points is only applicable if the student scores an L1R5 of 20 points or less. School administrations struggled to cope with the admission procedures of two student batches in an academic year. It is also argued that in many cases, lessons had to be retaught as many students did not remain in the same pre- university centre after the PAE because some left for other JCs or polytechnics.  End of PAE  The Ministry of Education had originally announced the consolidation of a single admission batch for pre-university centres from 2006 onwards, but due to administrative problems, the abolishment was delayed till 2009, making 2008 the last year with PAE. This coincides with the arrangement between SEAB and UCLES to cut short the marking period of papers.

According to Irish tradition, the Rath is the burial place of Heremon, son of the Celtic Taoiseach Milesius. The Gaelic name is Rath Beithigh, meaning \\"the Rath of the Birch trees.\\" It is located in an ancient valley once called M√°gh Airgid Rois (\\"The Plain of the Silver Wood\\"). It consists of a flat-topped oval mound about north to south and east to west. A fosse wide surrounds the mound, leaving a gap at the river's edge. Outside there is a rampart about high. The whole structure overlooks a bend on the Nore. The river is fordable at this location, so strategically the fort controlled the crossing. Parts of the Rath are being eroded by the presence of livestock in the field. The remains of a church dedicated to St. Catherine is located in the graveyard situated just about north of the Rath. The church is built on the site of an earlier castle or stronghouse. Remains of what are believed to be stables or workshops were discovered in the adjacent field. The earliest gravestone date that can be distinguished in the graveyard is 1715. Just east of the old church is a pond under the road, known locally as Poll Leabhair, meaning \\"the Pond of the Book\\" or \\"Hole of the Book.\\" According to tradition, the church was desecrated during the Cromwellian wars, and the Missal was dumped in this pond. In the mid-19th century the church bell was found in a sand-pit in a nearby field and was presented to the Church of Ireland Church in Killeshan, Carlow, according to Carrigan's History of Ossory. A well nearby is known as St. Catherine's Well. Its specific location is unclear, but it is somewhere a short distance south of Poll Leabhair and between the field known as The Paddock and the river Nore. Oral history records that the well's water was very popular as a cure for eye disease.

Ernie Hayes was a right-handed batsman, usually batting at No 3 and strong at driving and pulling, a leg-break bowler and a fine slip fielder. He was a regular in the Surrey side for 15 years up to the First World War, scoring 1,000 runs and more in every season from 1899 to 1914. His best year was 1906 when he scored 2,309 runs at an average of more than 45 runs an innings, and he was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1907. His highest score, 276, was made against Hampshire in 1909 at The Oval, when he shared a second wicket partnership of 371 with Jack Hobbs that remains a Surrey record. Hayes' bowling was intermittently useful: in 1905, he took 76 wickets, and in 1912 there were 60, but in other seasons he took very few and was expensive. As a slip fielder, he took more than 600 catches in all matches. Hayes' Test match career was not a success. He went to South African under Pelham Warner in 1905‚Äì06 and played in three of the Tests in the first series ever won against England by the South African cricket team. He scored just 69 runs, with a top score of 35. He also went on the 1907‚Äì08 tour to Australia, but his form was so poor that he was not picked for any of the Tests. In 1909, he played once in a home Test against the Australians, but though the match was won, he scored only 13 runs in his two innings. Finally, he was recalled for one match against South Africa in the 1912 Triangular Tournament, and scored just four runs. After distinguished war service that won him the MBE, Hayes returned to Surrey as an amateur in 1919, but retired after just one season. He was afflicted with a contracture of the fingers of the right hand that made holding a bat difficult: this was attributed to years of fielding at slip to the stinging pace of Tom Richardson and William Lockwood. He moved to Leicestershire as coach and Second Eleven captain, and was so successful that, in 1926, at the age of 49, he was picked for five first-team matches, scoring 99 against Nottinghamshire in his first game and heading the county's averages. In all cricket, he scored 27,318 runs with 48 centuries, and took 515 wickets. He was later coach at Surrey. In 1933 he retired to run a pub, the Paxton Arms in West Norwood, being its landlord for 20 years.Keith Booth, Ernest Hayes ‚Äì Brass in a Golden Age, ACS Publications, 2009, .

On his debut, he took five wickets in the first innings in Johannesburg. Biography He was born on Christmas Day, 25 December 1875 in Yorkshire. He learned his cricket in London and began his career with Surrey in 1896, but was regarded as merely promising until the following year when he took a regular place from the out-of-form William Lockwood and took 75 wickets despite being overshadowed by Tom Richardson. On two occasions his bowling was nonetheless a vital factor in Surrey winning or turning around matches. The following few years, however, were very patchy and Lees struggled to maintain his place in the side against competition from the rejuvenated Lockwood and Bill Brockwell. He lost his place very early in 1898 and did not become a regular again until 1900, when performances like eight for 31 against Hampshire and nine wickets in a superb win over Lancashire showed he had the potential to be a major force. However, Lees was again disappointing in 1901 and almost completely lost his place in 1902 despite Surrey being dreadfully short of bowlers. However, in the following year a performance of thirteen wickets for 75 runs against Cambridge University saw Lees finally establish himself as an integral part of the Surrey eleven. Although he only twice took five wickets in a County Championship innings, Lees not only took 102 wickets but developed his hard hitting sufficiently to be often valuable as a batsman for a team weakened immensely by the loss of Brockwell and Bobby Abel. 1904 saw Lees raised to the status of Surrey's chief bowler (except on sticky wickets) by the dropping out of Lockwood and Richardson, but by the standards of the day he was very expensive in most matches. However, in 1905 Lees, aided by some fiery pitches at the Oval in July and August, rose far beyond what his previous performances would suggest. With improved accuracy, spin and life from the fast pitches he was the leading wicket-taker in England, falling only seven short of 200 first-class wickets at a price far below any he had previously managed. Wisden ‚Äì Walter Lees This earned Lees a Wisden Cricketer of the Year nomination in 1906, and he was chosen for a tour to South Africa. His batting remained on the same level as previous years, but he did hit a maiden century in fifty minutes against Hampshire, something he was to repeat a year later against Sussex. In 1906, though he took 168 wickets, Lees was overshadowed by the tremendous speed of Neville Knox on the dry but very true Oval pitches, but was believed by observers to be just as good as in 1905.Pardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty-Fourth Edition (1907), p. 47 In a famous match for the Players, Lees put on more pace than usual and took six wickets, whilst with 51 he proved better able to play Knox and Walter Brearley than most of the recognised professional batsmen.Pardon (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty-Fourth Edition (1907), pp. 332-334 Lees‚Äô 1907 season was affected by a strain that cost him a month‚Äôs cricket and any chance of representative honours, whilst from 1908 inconsistency began to plague his bowling and his batting was no longer of value. Though he had some deadly days in 1909, it was clear Lees was on the way down, and by the end of 1910 he had lost his place in the Surrey side to Bill Hitch and Tom Rushby. After a few games in 1911, Lees was not re-engaged. He died in 1924 still short of his fiftieth birthday.

Although the type species, B. excelsus, had long been considered a species of the closely related Apatosaurus, researchers proposed in 2015 that Brontosaurus is a genus separate from Apatosaurus and that it contains three species: B. excelsus, B. yahnahpin, and B. parvus. Brontosaurus had a long, thin neck and a small head adapted for a herbivorous lifestyle, a bulky, heavy torso, and a long, whip- like tail. The various species lived during the Late Jurassic epoch in the Morrison Formation of what is now North America, and were extinct by the end of the Jurassic.Foster, J. (2007). Jurassic West: The Dinosaurs of the Morrison Formation and Their World. Indiana University Press. 389pp. Adult individuals of Brontosaurus are estimated to have weighed up to and measured up to long. As the archetypal sauropod, Brontosaurus is one of the best-known dinosaurs and has been featured in film, advertising, and postage stamps, as well as many other types of media. Description Comparison of three specimens and a human: Oklahoma specimen of Apatosaurus ajax (orange), A. louisae (red), and Brontosaurus parvus (green) Brontosaurus was a large, long- necked, quadrupedal animal with a long, whip-like tail, and fore limbs that were slightly shorter than its hind limbs. The largest species, B. excelsus, weighed up to and measured up to long from head to tail. The skull of Brontosaurus has not been found, but was probably similar to the skull of the closely related Apatosaurus. Like those of other sauropods, the vertebrae of the neck were deeply bifurcated; that is, they carried paired spines, resulting in a wide and deep neck. The spine and tail consisted of 15 cervicals, ten dorsals, five sacrals, and about 82 caudals. The number of caudal vertebrae was noted to vary, even within a species. The cervical vertebrae were stouter than other diplodocids, though not as stout as in mature specimens of Apatosaurus. The dorsal ribs are not fused or tightly attached to their vertebrae, instead being loosely articulated. Ten dorsal ribs are on either side of the body. The large neck was filled with an extensive system of weight-saving air sacs. Brontosaurus, like its close relative Apatosaurus, had tall spines on its vertebrae, which made up more than half the height of the individual bones. The shape of the tail was unusual for diplodocids, being comparatively slender, due to the vertebral spines rapidly decreasing in height the farther they are from the hips. Brontosaurus spp. also had very long ribs compared to most other diplodocids, giving them unusually deep chests. As in other diplodocids, the last portion of the tail of Brontosaurus possessed a whip-like structure. Restoration of B. excelsus. The limb bones were also very robust. The arm bones are stout, with the humerus resembling that of Camarasaurus, and those of B. excelsus being nearly identical to those of Apatosaurus ajax. Charles Gilmore in 1936 noted that previous reconstructions erroneously proposed that the radius and ulna could cross, when in life they would have remained parallel. Brontosaurus had a single large claw on each fore limb, and the first three toes possessed claws on each foot. Even by 1936, it was recognized that no sauropod had more than one hand claw preserved, and this one claw is now accepted as the maximum number throughout the entire group. The single front claw bone is slightly curved and squarely shortened on the front end. The hip bones included robust ilia and the fused pubes and ischia. The tibia and fibula bones of the lower leg were different from the slender bones of Diplodocus, but nearly indistinguishable from those of Camarasaurus. The fibula is longer than the tibia, although it is also more slender. History O.C. Marsh. The head is based on material now assigned to Brachiosaurus sp. In 1879, Othniel Charles Marsh, a professor of paleontology at Yale University, announced the discovery of a large and fairly complete sauropod skeleton from Morrison Formation rocks at Como Bluff, Wyoming. He identified it as belonging to an entirely new genus and species, which he named Brontosaurus excelsus, meaning \\"thunder lizard\\", from the Greek / meaning \\"thunder\\" and / meaning \\"lizard\\", and from the Latin excelsus, \\"noble\\" or \\"high\\". By this time, the Morrison Formation had become the center of the Bone Wars, a fossil-collecting rivalry between Marsh and another early paleontologist, Edward Drinker Cope. Because of this, the publications and descriptions of taxa by Marsh and Cope were rushed at the time. Obsolete mount of an apatosaurine referred to B. excelsus (specimen AMNH 460) with sculpted skull, completed in 1905, American Museum of Natural History Elmer Riggs, in the 1903 edition of Geological Series of the Field Columbian Museum, argued that Brontosaurus was not different enough from Apatosaurus to warrant its own genus, so he created the new combination Apatosaurus excelsus for it. Riggs stated that \\"In view of these facts the two genera may be regarded as synonymous. As the term 'Apatosaurus' has priority, 'Brontosaurus' will be regarded as a synonym\\". Nonetheless, before the mounting of the American Museum of Natural History specimen, Henry Fairfield Osborn chose to label the skeleton \\"Brontosaurus\\", though he was a strong opponent of Marsh and his taxa. In 1905, the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH) unveiled the first-ever mounted skeleton of a sauropod, a composite specimen (mainly made of bones from AMNH 460) that they referred to as the species Brontosaurus excelsus. The AMNH specimen was very complete, only missing the feet (feet from the specimen AMNH 592 were added to the mount), lower leg, and shoulder bones (added from AMNH 222), and tail bones (added from AMNH 339).Norell, M.A., Gaffney, E.S., & Dingus, L. (1995). Discovering Dinosaurs in the American Museum of Natural History. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. To complete the mount, the rest of the tail was fashioned to appear as Marsh believed it should, which had too few vertebrae. In addition, a sculpted model of what the museum felt the skull of this massive creature might look like was placed on the skeleton. This was not a delicate skull like that of Diplodocus, which would later turn out to be more accurate, but was based on \\"the biggest, thickest, strongest skull bones, lower jaws and tooth crowns from three different quarries\\". These skulls were likely those of Camarasaurus, the only other sauropod for which good skull material was known at the time. The mount construction was overseen by Adam Hermann, who failed to find Brontosaurus skulls. Hermann was forced to sculpt a stand-in skull by hand. Henry Fairfield Osborn noted in a publication that the skull was \\"largely conjectural and based on that of Morosaurus\\" (now Camarasaurus). Skeleton of the AMNH apatosaurine (possibly B. excelsus, specimen AMNH 460) as remounted in 1995 In 1909, an Apatosaurus skull was found, during the first expedition to what would become the Carnegie Quarry at Dinosaur National Monument, led by Earl Douglass. The skull was found a few meters away from a skeleton (specimen CM 3018) identified as the new species Apatosaurus louisae. The skull was designated CM 11162, and was very similar to the skull of Diplodocus. It was accepted as belonging to the Apatosaurus specimen by Douglass and Carnegie Museum director William H. Holland, although other scientists, most notably Osborn, rejected this identification. Holland defended his view in 1914 in an address to the Paleontological Society of America, yet he left the Carnegie Museum mount headless. While some thought Holland was attempting to avoid conflict with Osborn, others suspected that Holland was waiting until an articulated skull and neck were found to confirm the association of the skull and skeleton. After Holland's death in 1934, a cast of a Camarasaurus skull was placed on the mount by museum staff. Hypothetical skull, sculpted in 1931, Yale Peabody Museum At the Yale Peabody Museum, a skeleton was mounted in 1931 with a skull unique from all the others. While at the time most museums were using Camarasaurus casts, the Peabody Museum sculpted a completely different skull. They based the lower jaw on a Camarasaurus mandible, with the cranium resembling Marsh's 1891 illustration. The skull also included forward-pointing nasals, something truly different to any dinosaur, and fenestrae differing from the drawing and other skulls. No apatosaurine skull was mentioned in literature until the 1970s, when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. They found that though he never published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that Apatosaurus (and Brontosaurus) had a Diplodocus-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought to pertain to Diplodocus might instead be those of Apatosaurus. They reassigned multiple skulls to Apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Though they supported Holland, Apatosaurus was noted to possibly have possessed a Camarasaurus-like skull, based on a disarticulated Camarasaurus-like tooth found at the precise site where an Apatosaurus specimen was found years before. On October 20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first skull of an Apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1995, the American Museum of Natural History followed suit, and unveiled their remounted skeleton (now labelled Apatosaurus excelsus) with a corrected tail and a new skull cast from A. louisae. In 1998, the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh included in his 1896 skeletal restoration was suggested to belong to Brachiosaurus instead. In 2011, the first specimen of Apatosaurus where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMC VP 7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from A. louisae, and the specimen was found to have a majority of features related to those of A. ajax. Infographic explaining the history of Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus according to Tschopp et al. 2015 Almost all 20th-century paleontologists agreed with Riggs that all Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus species should be classified in a single genus. According to the rules of the ICZN (which governs the scientific names of animals), the name Apatosaurus, having been published first, had priority as the official name; Brontosaurus was considered a junior synonym and was therefore discarded from formal use. Despite this, at least one paleontologist‚ÄîRobert T. Bakker‚Äîargued in the 1990s that A. ajax and A. excelsus are in fact sufficiently distinct that the latter continues to merit a separate genus. In 2015, an extensive study of diplodocid relationships by Emanuel Tschopp, Octavio Mateus, and Roger Benson concluded that Brontosaurus was indeed a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus. The scientists developed a statistical method to more objectively assess differences between fossil genera and species, and concluded that Brontosaurus could be \\"resurrected\\" as a valid name. They assigned two former Apatosaurus species, A. parvus and A. yahnahpin, to Brontosaurus, as well as the type species B. excelsus. Paleontologist Michael D'Emic made a critique.D'Emic, M. 2015. \\"Not so fast, Brontosaurus\\". Time.com Palaeontologist Donald Prothero criticized the mass media reaction to this study as superficial and premature, concluding: > Until someone has convincingly addressed the issue, I'm going to put > \\"Brontosaurus\\" in quotes and not follow the latest media fad, nor will I > overrule Riggs (1903) and put the name in my books as a valid > genus.Prothero, D. 2015. \\"Is \\"Brontosaurus\\" Back? Not So Fast!\\". > Skeptic.com. Classification Brontosaurus is a member of the family Diplodocidae, a clade of gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. The family includes some of the longest and largest creatures ever to walk the earth, including Diplodocus, Supersaurus, and Barosaurus. Brontosaurus is also classified in the subfamily Apatosaurinae, which also includes Apatosaurus and one or more possible unnamed genera. Othniel Charles Marsh described Brontosaurus as being allied to Atlantosaurus, within the now defunct group Atlantosauridae. In 1878, Marsh raised his family to the rank of suborder, including Apatosaurus, Brontosaurus, Atlantosaurus, Morosaurus (=Camarasaurus), and Diplodocus. He classified this group within Sauropoda. In 1903, Elmer S. Riggs mentioned that the name Sauropoda would be a junior synonym of earlier names, and grouped Apatosaurus within Opisthocoelia. Most authors still use Sauropoda as the group name. Left front limb of B. yahnahpin, Morrison Natural History Museum Originally named by its discoverer Othniel Charles Marsh in 1879, Brontosaurus had long been considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus; its type species, Brontosaurus excelsus, was reclassified as A. excelsus in 1903. However, an extensive study published in 2015 by a joint British-Portuguese research team concluded that Brontosaurus was a valid genus of sauropod distinct from Apatosaurus. Nevertheless, not all paleontologists agree with this division. The same study classified two additional species that had once been considered Apatosaurus and Eobrontosaurus as Brontosaurus parvus and Brontosaurus yahnahpin respectively. Cladogram of the Diplodocidae after Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015): =Species= * Brontosaurus excelsus, the type species of Brontosaurus, was first named by Marsh in 1879. Many specimens, including the holotype specimen YPM 1980, have been assigned to the species. They include FMNH P25112, the skeleton mounted at the Field Museum of Natural History, which has since been found to represent an unknown species of apatosaurine. Brontosaurus amplus, occasionally assigned to B. parvus, is a junior synonym of B. excelsus. B. excelsus therefore only includes its type specimen and the type specimen of B. amplus. The largest of these specimens is estimated to have weighed up to 15 tonnes and measured up to long from head to tail. Both known definitive B. excelsus fossils have been reported from Reed's Quarry 10 of the Morrison Formation Brushy Basin member in Albany County, Wyoming, dated to the late Kimmeridgian age, about 152 million years ago. Mounted cast skeleton of B. parvus (UW 15556) * Brontosaurus parvus, first described as Elosaurus in 1902 by Peterson and Gilmore, was reassigned to Apatosaurus in 1994, and to Brontosaurus in 2015. Specimens assigned to this species include the holotype, CM 566 (a partial skeleton of a juvenile found in Sheep Creek Quarry 4 in Albany County, WY), BYU 1252-18531 (a nearly complete skeleton found in Utah and mounted at Brigham Young University), and the partial skeleton UW 15556 (which had once been accidentally mixed together with the holotype). It dates to the middle Kimmeridgian. Adult specimens are estimated to have weighed up to 14 tonnes and measured up to long from head to tail. *Brontosaurus yahnahpin is the oldest species, known from a single site from the lower Morrison Formation, Bertha Quarry, in Albany County, Wyoming, dating to about 155 million years ago.Turner, C.E. and Peterson, F., (1999). \\"Biostratigraphy of dinosaurs in the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation of the Western Interior, U.S.A.\\" Pp. 77‚Äì114 in Gillette, D. D. (ed.), Vertebrate Paleontology in Utah. Utah Geological Survey Miscellaneous Publication 99-1. It grew up to long.Holtz, Thomas R. Jr. (2011) Dinosaurs: The Most Complete, Up-to-Date Encyclopedia for Dinosaur Lovers of All Ages, Winter 2010 Appendix. The type species, E. yahnahpin, was described by James Filla and Patrick Redman in 1994 as a species of Apatosaurus (A. yahnahpin).Filla, J.A., Redman, P.D. (1994). \\"Apatosaurus yahnahpin: a preliminary description of a new species of diplodocid dinosaur from the Late Jurassic Morrison Formation (Kimmeridgian-Portlandian) and Cloverly Formation (Aptian-Albian) of the western United States\\", M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France (Nouvelle S√©rie) 139 (Ecosyst√®mes Continentaux du M√©sozoique): 87-93 The specific name is derived from Lakota mah-koo yah-nah-pin, \\"breast necklace\\", a reference to the pairs of sternal ribs that resemble the hair pipes traditionally worn by the tribe. The holotype specimen is TATE-001, a relatively complete postcranial skeleton found in Wyoming, in the lower Morrison Formation. More fragmentary remains have also been referred to the species. A re-evaluation by Robert T. Bakker in 1998 found it to be more primitive, so Bakker coined the new generic name Eobrontosaurus, derived from Greek , \\"dawn\\", and Brontosaurus.Bakker, R.T. (1998). \\"Dinosaur mid-life crisis: the Jurassic- Cretaceous transition in Wyoming and Colorado\\". In: S.G. Lucas, J.I. Kirkland, & J.W. Estep (eds.) Lower and Middle Cretaceous Terrestrial Ecosystems; New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin, 14: 67‚Äì77. The cladogram below is the result of an analysis by Tschopp, Mateus, and Benson (2015). The authors analyzed most diplodocid type specimens separately to deduce which specimen belonged to which species and genus. Tail vertebra of B. excelsus specimen YPM 1980 Palaeobiology =Posture and locomotion= Cast of B. parvus specimen UWGM 15556 at Tellus Science Museum Historically, sauropods like Brontosaurus were believed to be too massive to support their own weight on dry land, so theoretically they must have lived partly submerged in water, perhaps in swamps. Recent findings do not support this, and sauropods are thought to have been fully terrestrial animals. Diplodocids like Brontosaurus are often portrayed with their necks held high up in the air, allowing them to browse on tall trees. Though some studies have suggested that diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, other studies have found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argue that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Trackways of sauropods like Brontosaurus show that the average range for them was around per day, and they could potentially reach a top speed of . The slow locomotion of sauropods may be due to the minimal muscling or recoil after strides. Various uses have been proposed for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods. They were suggested to have been for defence, but the shape and size of them makes this unlikely. Other predictions were that it could be for feeding, but the most probable is that the claw was for grasping objects like tree trunks when rearing. =Physiology= James Spotila et al. (1991) suggest that the large body size of Brontosaurus and other sauropods would have made them unable to maintain high metabolic rates, as they would not be able to release enough heat. However, temperatures in the Jurassic were 3 degrees Celsius higher than present. They assumed that the animals had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel found that an avian system would have allowed them to dump more heat. Some scientists have argued that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. =Juveniles= Reconstructed skeleton of a juvenile B. parvus (type specimen CM 566), Carnegie Museum of Natural History Juvenile Brontosaurus material is known based on the type specimen of B. parvus. The material of this specimen, CM 566, includes vertebrae from various regions, one pelvic bone, and some bones of the hind limb. =Tail= An article that appeared in the November 1997 issue of Discover Magazine reported research into the mechanics of diplodocid tails by Nathan Myhrvold, a computer scientist from Microsoft. Myhrvold carried out a computer simulation of the tail, which in diplodocids like Brontosaurus was a very long, tapering structure resembling a bullwhip. This computer modeling suggested that sauropods were capable of producing a whip-like cracking sound of over 200 decibels, comparable to the volume of a cannon. Paleoecology Restoration of a B. excelsus group The Morrison Formation is a sequence of shallow marine and alluvial sediments which, according to radiometric dating, ranges between 156.3 million years old (Mya) at its base, and 146.8 Mya at the top, which places it in the late Oxfordian, Kimmeridgian, and early Tithonian stages of the Late Jurassic period. This formation is interpreted as a semiarid environment with distinct wet and dry seasons. The Morrison Basin, where dinosaurs lived, stretched from New Mexico to Alberta and Saskatchewan, and was formed when the precursors to the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains started pushing up to the west. The deposits from their east-facing drainage basins were carried by streams and rivers and deposited in swampy lowlands, lakes, river channels, and floodplains. This formation is similar in age to the Lourinha Formation in Portugal and the Tendaguru Formation in Tanzania. Brontosaurus may have been a more solitary animal than other Morrison Formation dinosaurs. As a genus, Brontosaurus existed for a long span of time, and have been found in most levels of the Morrison. B. excelsus fossils have been reported from the upper Salt Wash Member to the upper Brushy Basin Member, ranging from the middle to late Kimmeridgian age, about 154‚Äì151 Mya. Additional remains are known from even younger rocks, but they have not been identified as any particular species. Older Brontosaurus remains have also been identified from the middle Kimmeridgian, and are assigned to B. parvus. Fossils of these animals have been found in Nine Mile Quarry and Bone Cabin Quarry in Wyoming and at sites in Colorado, Oklahoma, and Utah, present in stratigraphic zones 2‚Äì6. The Morrison Formation records an environment and time dominated by gigantic sauropod dinosaurs. Dinosaurs known from the Morrison include the theropods Ceratosaurus, Ornitholestes, and Torvosaurus, the sauropods Apatosaurus, Brachiosaurus, Camarasaurus, and Diplodocus, and the ornithischians Camptosaurus, Dryosaurus, and Stegosaurus. Other vertebrates that shared this paleoenvironment included ray-finned fishes, frogs, salamanders, turtles, sphenodonts, lizards, terrestrial and aquatic crocodylomorphans, and several species of pterosaurs. Shells of bivalves and aquatic snails are also common. The flora of the period has been revealed by fossils of green algae, fungi, mosses, horsetails, cycads, ginkgoes, and several families of conifers. Vegetation varied from river-lining forests of tree ferns, and ferns (gallery forests), to fern savannas with occasional trees such as the Araucaria-like conifer Brachyphyllum. In popular culture Outdated 1897 restoration by Charles R. Knight of B. excelsus submerged in water, and Diplodocus dragging its tail The length of time taken for Riggs's 1903 reclassification of Brontosaurus as Apatosaurus to be brought to public notice, as well as Osborn's insistence that the Brontosaurus name be retained despite Riggs's paper, meant that the Brontosaurus became one of the most famous dinosaurs. Brontosaurus has often been depicted in cinema, beginning with Winsor McCay's 1914 classic Gertie the Dinosaur, one of the first animated films. McCay based his unidentified dinosaur on the apatosaurine skeleton in the American Museum of Natural History. The 1925 silent film The Lost World featured a battle between a Brontosaurus and an Allosaurus, using special effects by Willis O'Brien. These, and other early uses of the animal as major representative of the group, helped cement Brontosaurus as a quintessential dinosaur in the public consciousness. Sinclair Oil Corporation has long been a fixture of American roads (and briefly in other countries) with its green dinosaur logo and mascot, a Brontosaurus. While Sinclair's early advertising included a number of different dinosaurs, eventually only Brontosaurus was used as the official logo, due to its popular appeal. Gertie the Dinosaur (1914) As late as 1989, the U.S. Postal Service caused controversy when it issued four \\"dinosaur\\" stamps: Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus, Pteranodon, and Brontosaurus. The use of the term Brontosaurus in place of Apatosaurus led to complaints of \\"fostering scientific illiteracy.\\" The Postal Service defended itself (in Postal Bulletin 21744) by saying, \\"Although now recognized by the scientific community as Apatosaurus, the name Brontosaurus was used for the stamp because it is more familiar to the general population.\\" Indeed, the Postal Service even implicitly rebuked the somewhat inconsistent complaints by adding that \\"[s]imilarly, the term 'dinosaur' has been used generically to describe all the animals [i.e., all four of the animals represented in the given stamp set], even though the Pteranodon was a flying reptile [rather than a true 'dinosaur'],\\" a distinction left unmentioned in the numerous correspondence regarding the Brontosaurus/Apatosaurus issue. Palaeontologist Stephen Jay Gould not only supported this position, but indeed, cheered and advanced it enough to not only name an essay, but even the entire book of which it is but a part Bully for Brontosaurus, stating: \\"Touch√© and right on; no one bitched about Pteranodon, and that's a real error.\\" His position, however, was not one suggesting the exclusive use of the popular moniker; he echoed Riggs' original argument that Brontosaurus is a synonym for Apatosaurus. Nevertheless, he noted that the former has developed and continues to maintain an independent existence in the popular imagination. The more vociferous denunciations of the usage have elicited sharply defensive statements from those who would not wish to see the name be struck from official usage. Tschopp's study has generated a very high number of responses from many, often opposed, groups - of editorial, news staff, and personal blog nature (both related and not), from both sides of the debate, from related and unrelated contexts, and from all over the world.

Because of his profession as a singer, Knox's cricket career was short, but he was undoubtedly the fastest bowler of his time and one of the fastest bowlers ever to play for England ‚Äì probably capable of speeds over 150 km/h (93 mph). Life and career Knox attended Dulwich College.Hodges, S, (1981), God's Gift: A Living History of Dulwich College, pages 232, (Heinemann: London) He played two matches for Surrey in 1904 without achieving a great deal, but the following year, aided by some fiery pitches at The Oval, advanced so much that he was an excellent backup to Walter Lees in a major Surrey revival. Although he was expensive on true pitches Knox took 129 wickets for less than 22 runs each, and his promise was clearly noted, though even then the length (over 20 metres ‚Äì very long for the time) of his run-up was seen as taking a great deal of energy out of him and it was thought Knox would have trouble coping with arduous seasons. The following season ‚Äì one with hardly a day of rain in the Home Counties after early May ‚Äì bore out almost all that was thought of Knox. When sound, he was clearly the fastest bowler seen for a long time in county cricketPardon, Sydney H. (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty- Fourth Edition (1907); p. cxxviii and, even on much truer Oval pitches, he was able to make the ball rise dangerously. He could also spin the ball back from the off as much as Richardson at his best. Early in the season, Knox‚Äôs bowling was beyond everything else the factor behind Surrey rising to the top of the table, and at times ‚Äì notably against Leicestershire and Sussex at the Oval ‚Äì his pace could bowl sides out cheaply on even the best of pitches. However, from the middle of June, the strain of bowling on such hard, sun-soaked pitches took its toll and Knox suffered constantly from shin strains. These strains kept him out of nine of Surrey‚Äôs last sixteen matches and according to Wisden, Knox ‚Äúoften played when he should have been resting.‚Äù Nonetheless, his twelve wickets for 174 against the Players at Lord's in July is still remembered as perhaps the fastest bowling ever seen in the history of Gentlemen v Players games:Pardon (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty-Fifth edition (1908), part II, p. 101 some of the professional batsmen were literally intimidated. Knox was rewarded for this and his superb early season form with nomination as a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1907, though a wet summer severely restricted his opportunities, a superb effort against a powerful South African team earned Knox a place in the second Test at Headingley. This turned out to be a grievous error because he was a mere passenger on a very soft pitch,Pardon (editor) John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty-Fifth edition (1908), part II, p. 27 and even at The Oval in the third Test Knox did not achieve much. Indeed, not playing as regularly as before, Knox took only 44 County Championship wickets and 70 in all games - as against 117 and 144 in 1906. At the end of 1907, Knox announced he would be playing no more first-class cricket, but soon before the 1908 season began it was expected he would play regularly in July and August.Pardon (editor); John Wisden‚Äôs Cricketers‚Äô Almanack; Forty-Sixth edition (1909); part II, p. 46 A superb performance for the Gentlemen at the Oval gave Surrey great hope he would be as good as in 1906, but he only played in three matches, and in 1909 could spare no time for cricket at all. 1910 saw Knox back in the Surrey eleven for five matches, in which he bowled as well as before, but after July he could never again spare any time for county cricket ‚Äì thus ending a brief but brilliant career. In the Great War Knox joined the Royal Army Ordnance Corps as a Lieutenant, being promoted to Captain in 1919 and ending his army career as a Major. Continuing his career as a singer, Neville Knox was in poor health for many years before his death in 1935.

Historical situation In the Second World War some of the signing scientists had been members of the Uranverein, a nuclear research project of the Nazi regime. The war ended with the nuclear destruction of the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki by the United States. After World War II the Cold War began. In 1953 the hydrogen bomb was invented. A short time later both superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, had a so-called overkill potential. In the whole world and especially in the frontier states of the Cold War there was a great fear of nuclear war at that time. Germany was divided, and both German states were frontier states in the Cold War. In May 1955, West Germany became a sovereign nation and joined NATO. It founded its own army, the Bundeswehr, in 1955. There were many protests against the remilitarisation of West Germany. In 1956 East Germany founded its own army, the Nationale Volksarmee (NVA). Following the end of the Korean War, NATO's focus shifted to Europe. Through NATO, the United States deployed its first nuclear weapons in West Germany in March 1955. This led to proposals for the development of similar capabilities for newly created West German army (Bundeswehr) in the course of the year 1956. Franz Josef Strauss, appointed Federal Minister of Nuclear Energy in 1955, and Defence Minister in 1956, was charged with building up the West German defence forces. Attempts by German nuclear physicists, including Otto Hahn and Carl Friedrich von Weizs√§cker, to dissuade Germany politicians from nuclear expansion were felt to be unsuccessful. On April 5, 1957 chancellor Konrad Adenauer trivialized tactical nuclear weapons in a press release as ‚Äúespecially harmless weapons‚Äù.

Some of us have raised our concerns a few months ago with the appropriate federal minister. Today the debate on this question has become general knowledge. The undersigned therefore feel the requirement to speak up about facts known to experts, but which seem to be inadequately known to the public. 1) Tactical nuclear weapons have the same destructive effect as normal atomic bombs. They are \\"tactical\\" only insofar as they are applied not only to civilian residences, but also to ground troops. Every single tactical nuclear weapon has a similar effect to the first atom bomb which destroyed Hiroshima. Since tactical nuclear weapons are available in significant numbers their destructive effect is on the whole much larger. They are only \\"small\\" in comparison to recently developed bombs, principally the hydrogen bomb. 2) There is no natural limit for the development of life- threatening effects of strategic nuclear weapons. Today a tactical nuclear weapon can destroy a small city, and a hydrogen bomb can render an entire region such as the Ruhr Valley uninhabitable. Already today, one can probably wipe out the entire population of West Germany with the radioactivity from H-bombs. We know of no technical means to protect a large population from this threat. We realise how difficult it is to foresee the political consequences of these facts. Since we are apolitical, no one expects us to do so. Our profession, i.e. pure science and its application, through which we bring many young people into our fold, leaves us with the responsibility for the potential effects of these actions. Therefore we cannot remain silent to all political issues. We align ourselves with the freedom that the Western world represents against Communism. We cannot deny the fear of the H-bomb contributes to the maintenance of peace in the whole world, and freedom in part of the world. However this form of peace and freedom is in the long term untenable, and the collapse of this situation is potentially deadly. We have no expertise to make concrete political suggestions to the Superpowers. We believe that a small country such as West Germany is best protected, and world peace most assisted when nuclear weapons of any type are banned. In any case, none of the undersigned are prepared to participate in the creation, testing or deployment of any type of nuclear weapon. At the same time we feel it is extremely important that we continue to work together on the peaceful development of nuclear energy.

Einige von ihnen haben den zust√§ndigen Bundesministern ihre Bedenken schon vor mehreren Monaten mitgeteilt. Heute ist eine Debatte √ºber diese Frage allgemein geworden. Die Unterzeichnenden f√ºhlen sich daher verpflichtet, √∂ffentlich auf einige Tatsachen hinzuweisen, die alle Fachleute wissen, die aber der √ñffentlichkeit noch nicht hinreichend bekannt zu sein scheinen. 1\\\\. Taktische Atomwaffen haben die zerst√∂rende Wirkung normaler Atombomben. Als \\"taktisch\\" bezeichnet man sie, um auszudr√ºcken, da√ü sie nicht nur gegen menschliche Siedlungen, sondern auch gegen Truppen im Erdkampf eingesetzt werden sollen. Jede einzelne taktische Atombombe oder -granate hat eine √§hnliche Wirkung wie die erste Atombombe, die Hiroshima zerst√∂rt hat. Da die taktischen Atomwaffen heute in gro√üer Zahl vorhanden sind, w√ºrde ihre zerst√∂rende Wirkung im ganzen sehr viel gr√∂√üer sein. Als \\"klein\\" bezeichnet man diese Bomben nur im Vergleich zur Wirkung der inzwischen entwickelten \\"strategischen\\" Bomben, vor allem der Wasserstoffbomben. 2\\\\. F√ºr die Entwicklungsm√∂glichkeit der lebensausrottenden Wirkung der strategischen Atomwaffen ist keine nat√ºrliche Grenze bekannt. Heute kann eine taktische Atombombe eine kleinere Stadt zerst√∂ren, eine Wasserstoffbombe aber einen Landstrich von der Gr√∂√üe des Ruhrgebietes zeitweilig unbewohnbar machen. Durch Verbreitung von Radioaktivit√§t k√∂nnte man mit Wasserstoffbomben die Bev√∂lkerung der Bundesrepublik wahrscheinlich schon heute ausrotten. Wir kennen keine technische M√∂glichkeit, gro√üe Bev√∂lkerungsmengen vor dieser Gefahr sicher zu sch√ºtzen. Wir wissen, wie schwer es ist, aus diesen Tatsachen die politischen Konsequenzen zu ziehen. Uns als Nichtpolitikern wird man die Berechtigung dazu abstreiten wollen; unsere T√§tigkeit, die der reinen Wissenschaft und ihrer Anwendung gilt und bei der wir viele junge Menschen unserem Gebiet zuf√ºhren, bel√§dt uns aber mit einer Verantwortung f√ºr die m√∂glichen Folgen dieser T√§tigkeit. Deshalb k√∂nnen wir nicht zu allen politischen Fragen schweigen. Wir bekennen uns zur Freiheit, wie sie heute die westliche Welt gegen den Kommunismus vertritt. Wir leugnen nicht, da√ü die gegenseitige Angst vor den Wasserstoffbomben heute einen wesentlichen Beitrag zur Erhaltung des Friedens in der ganzen Welt und der Freiheit in einem Teil der Welt leistet. Wir halten aber diese Art, den Frieden und die Freiheit zu sichern, auf die Dauer f√ºr unzuverl√§ssig, und wir halten die Gefahr im Falle des Versagens f√ºr t√∂dlich. Wir f√ºhlen keine Kompetenz, konkrete Vorschl√§ge f√ºr die Politik der Gro√üm√§chte zu machen. F√ºr ein kleines Land wie die Bundesrepublik glauben wir, da√ü es sich heute noch am besten sch√ºtzt und den Weltfrieden noch am ehesten f√∂rdert, wenn es ausdr√ºcklich und freiwillig auf den Besitz von Atomwaffen jeder Art verzichtet. Jedenfalls w√§re keiner der Unterzeichnenden bereit, sich an der Herstellung, der Erprobung oder dem Einsatz von Atomwaffen in irgendeiner Weise zu beteiligen. Gleichzeitig betonen wir, da√ü es √§u√üerst wichtig ist, die friedliche Verwendung der Atomenergie mit allen Mitteln zu f√∂rdern, und wir wollen an dieser Aufgabe wie bisher mitwirken.

Within the crater, the explosion also formed a series of small cones (known as scoria cones) and spheres surrounded by a crater lake. The Tower Hill crater is roughly wide and high, and as a giant maar (volcanic explosion crater), it is of international and national geological significance.

Tasmanian Devil: A unique and threatened animal. Allen & Unwin. . p. 41. Greenstone axe heads and other artefacts excavated from the tuff indicated that Aboriginal people were resident in the area when the volcano erupted. A basalt tool dubbed the \\"Bushfield Axe\\", found buried under volcanic ash near Tower Hill in 1947, was particularly significant. The evidence also aligns with local people's oral histories of volcanic eruptions, indicating the longevity of and truth contained in such histories. The Koroitgundidj people long inhabited this region of Australia and their descendants retain special links with the area. The most recent eruption was previously dated in 1990 as 25,000 BP.Orth, K.; King, R. (1990). The Geology of Tower Hill. Department of Industry, Victoria. . p. 3. However, in February 2020, new evidence came to light by using a more sophisticated method of dating than previously, a form of radiometric dating known as argon-argon dating, showing that both Budj Bim and Tower Hill volcanoes erupted at least 34,000 years ago. Specifically, Tower Hill was dated at within 3,800 years either side of 36,800 years BP. Significantly, this is a \\"minimum age constraint for human presence in Victoria\\", and also could be interpreted as evidence for the Gunditjmara oral histories which tell of volcanic eruptions being some of the oldest oral traditions in existence. The study was carried out by the University of Melbourne's School of Earth Sciences' David Phillips and three other researchers. The first confirmed sighting of Tower Hill by Europeans was by French explorers sailing with Captain Baudin aboard G√©ographe in 1802. Matthew Flinders sailed east along the southern coast of Australia and on 20 April 1802 in the ship's log referred to \\"Peaked Hill Position uncertain\\", which may refer to Tower Hill. The Hill was painted by the artist Eugene von Guerard in 1855, who was the foremost landscape artist in the colonies at the time. The painting Tower Hill, 1855Tower Hill is now in the Warnambool art gallery. The painting was used as a source of information of local native vegetation when an extensive revegetation project was undertaken in the Tower Hill Wildlife Reserve from 1961. =Naming= The origin of the English name, Tower Hill, is not certain. One source suggests that it arose in the 1840s owing to its resemblance to a castle, while another credits a sailor from Glasgow with \\"naming the site after Tower Hill in Scotland\\". Description Located about west of Melbourne and north-west of Warrnambool, Tower Hill's formation is known as a \\"nested maar\\", the largest of its type in Victoria. It was created by molten lava pushing its way up through the Earth's crust, before hitting a layer of water- bearing rock, which led to huge explosions. A shallow crater was left, later becoming a lake after it filled with rainwater. Subsequent to this, later eruptions occurred in the centre of this crater-lake, pushing up islands and cone-shaped hills, known as scoria cones. It is \\"one of the largest eruption points of the Pleistocene Newer Volcanics Province of Victoria\\". The main crater is by . Within the steep-walled tuff ring is a crater with a depth of over . Because of the complex nature of its formation and structure, and as one of the largest maars in the world, it is of great geological significance both nationally as internationally. Tower Hill volcano is roughly and high, and as a giant maar (volcanic explosion crater), it is of international and national geological significance. It has a gradient of between 10% to 80% at the higher points. Reserve Now part of the state park system as the Tower Hill Wildlife Reserve, the area had been used since European settlement for farming and stone quarrying.

Domestically, he played first-class cricket for Nottinghamshire from 1902 to 1932, and is their all-time leading run scorer. Playing career Along with other notable batsmen such as Jack Hobbs, Frank Woolley and Phil Mead, he was one of a group who, beginning their careers in the Edwardian Era, seemed to go on for ever. In Gunn's case, it was from 1902 to 1932, in the course of which he made more runs for Nottinghamshire than anyone else, before or since: 31,592 at 35.70.Christopher Martin-Jenkins (1981) The Wisden Book of County Cricket, Queen Anne Press, , p. 294. Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote of him: \\"A whimsical artist, George Gunn was capable of making runs against any attack, orthodox or unorthodox, as the mood took him. His record in a long career is outstanding, but all who saw him play regularly seem agreed that he should have scored even more runs than he did.\\"Christopher Martin-Jenkins (1981) The Wisden Book of County Cricket, Queen Anne Press, , p. 33. His Test career was an unusual one, all but one of his 15 Tests being outside England. He was not selected for the 1907‚Äì8 tour of Australia, but visited the country anyway, for the good of his health. It was arranged that he could be called upon by England if necessary. In the event, it was necessary, and he appeared in the first Test at Sydney. Scores of 119, in his first innings in Test cricket, and 74 ensured that he would play in all five Tests. He made another century, 122, in the fifth Test, also at Sydney. He topped the averages, with 462 runs at 51.33. He was only chosen for one Test in England's home series against Australia in 1909, making 0 and 1 in the second Test at Lord's, but toured again in 1911‚Äì12. Though not quite as successful as four years earlier, he made 381 runs at 42.33. After World War I, he was out of favour, and his final four Tests did not come until 1929‚Äì30, on a tour to the West Indies when several veteran players (e.g. Rhodes and Sandham) seem to have been chosen as a reward for long service. He was a member of a notable Nottinghamshire cricketing family, being a younger brother of John Gunn and a nephew of Billy Gunn, both of whom also played Test cricket, and the father of G. V. Gunn. He scored 164 not out on his fiftieth birthday, 13 June 1929, at Worcester. In 1931, at the age of 52 he scored 183 against Warwickshire, with his son scoring 100 not out in the same innings, a unique occurrence in first-class cricket. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1914.

In 1984, Lavelle was convicted on federal charges of perjury related to an investigation into misuse of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's \\"Superfund\\" money during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a major hazardous waste site. The Lavelle incident was labeled \\"Sewergate\\" or \\"Garbagegate\\" by the newspapers at the time.Michael Deaver. nndb.com In 2004, Lavelle was convicted again on unrelated federal charges of one count of wire fraud and two counts of making false statements to the FBI. Lavelle committed these crimes in her NuTECH Enterprises, Inc. business of environmental consultation. Biography Lavelle was born in Portsmouth, Virginia to Dr. Patrick Lavelle and Rita Lavelle. In 1969 Lavelle earned her bachelor's degree in Biology and Mathematics, with a minor in chemistry, from Holy Names University in Oakland, California. She continued her graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley in physiological chemistry and stoichiometry. She earned a master's degree cum laude in business administration from Pepperdine University in 1980. From 1969 to 1976, she was the California State Consumer Affairs Department information officer, state director of consumer education, and publications assistant in the office of then-Governor Ronald Reagan. She was director of marketing for Intercontinental and Continental Chemical Corporation in Sacramento, California, from 1976 to 1978. Lavelle's responsibilities included development of corporate guidelines to comply with the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, a law that her later position at the EPA left her to administer nationwide compliance with by both business and government sectors. Beginning in 1978, Lavelle initiated, directed and managed several programs for Aerojet-General Corporation subsidiaries; these included programs for divisions which manufactured chemicals and industrial and chemical intermediates, nuclear and chemical waste treatment systems, liquid rocket engines for the aerospace industry, and high-speed marine propulsion systems for defence applications. When Lavelle joined Aerojet-General Corporation, she became director of communications for one subsidiary, Cordova Chemical Co., until 1979, moving to a similar communications position for the largest subsidiary, Aerojet Liquid Rocket Co., in 1979. In 1981, she was named one of the outstanding women in aerospace by Aerospace Magazine. On February 18, 1982, President Ronald Reagan announced his intention to nominate Lavelle for assistant administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency for solid waste and emergency response. Her position included directing the hazardous waste control program and the $1.6 billion \\"Superfund\\" program which provides for the emergency cleanup of chemical spills and hazardous waste dumps. EPA Administrator Anne Gorsuch described Lavelle as bringing \\"over 12 years of professional experience in state government and private industry to the agency\\" and went on to say that \\"she has demonstrated expertise in getting results, as shown by her record with the executive branch of government in California, with a mid-sized chemical firm and with a large diversified international corporation.\\" Lavelle had held several positions of responsibility in the California Republican Party, including membership on the executive board of directors of California Federated Republican Women and the Sacramento and Alameda County central committees. Superfund Conviction Lavelle was indicted on federal perjury charges after an investigation was launched based on evidence submitted by another EPA employee, whistleblower Hugh Kaufman. The evidence showed that Lavelle was involved with misuse of the EPA's \\"Superfund\\" money during her tenure with the agency, and irregularities at the Stringfellow Acid Pits, a major hazardous waste site. In 1984, Lavelle was convicted of lying to the Congress and served three months of a six-month prison sentence, paid a $10,000 fine and was under probation for five years. Environmental Conviction Lavelle and a partner owned NuTECH Enterprises, Inc., an environmental consulting firm in Oceanside, California. Lavelle and Robert V. Cole, a part owner of Denova Environmental, Inc., a hazardous waste storage facility in Rialto, California, forged documents that purportedly bore the signature of Joseph Bertelli, the owner of Lemco Corporation in South Los Angeles, to make it appear that Bertelli owed Cole's company more than $52,000 for the removal and storage of hazardous waste. Those documents were used to obtain $36,441 from Capital Partners USA, Inc. Only when Capital Partners attempted to collect from Bertelli did it realize that Bertelli had neither signed the documents nor agreed to the bill, and Denova had never removed hazardous waste for Lemco. On September 24, 2004, a jury in Los Angeles federal court found Lavelle guilty of one count of wire fraud and two counts of making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Cole pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud and was sentenced on December 16, 2004, to one year of probation and was ordered to pay a $3,000 fine.

Founding In 1106, five Dutchmen journeyed from the mouth of the Rhine to Bremen to negotiate an arrangement with Archbishop Frederick I of Bremen to settle the swampy regions south of the Hunte on both sides of the Weser River, an area which came to be called Stedingen. The peasants were to cultivate the land, which would pass from father to son in free hereditary possession, while every settler would pay a yearly tax of one pfennig, the eleventh sheaf of all harvests, and a tenth of all livestock as acknowledgement of the archbishop's overlordship; otherwise, they would be free to administer their own affairs without interference by any secular lord. The arrangement found great favor among the younger Dutch peasants, who went to settle the area in large numbers, despite the difficulty of cultivating the marshy moorland, where the soil was poor and Heath, cotton grass and reeds covered the land and the riverbank. The settlers dug ditches to drain much of the water and built dikes to provide dry land and to prevent flooding. Gerard I During the reign of Gerard I () as archbishop (1210‚Äì1219), his kinsman Otto I, Count of Oldenburg, was given permission to built two fortresses, Lechtenburg and Lineburg, in Stedingen, in order to enforce both ecclesiastical and feudal discipline on the peasantry, who clung to old-style Germanic folk-customs and continually sought greater independence from the overlordship of Bremen. \\"The Stedingers refused to pay tithes and to perform forced labour as serfs, sticking to the original agreement of settlement. These duties were demanded of them with considerable severity...\\".Catholic Encyclopedia, vol. 14, 283‚Äì284 The Stedingers accused the Count's vassals of rape and kidnapping, and determined at their Thing or popular assembly to proclaim total independence, to refuse to pay their feudal tithes, to build bulwarks with fortified gates and trenches along the roads, and to form militias in order to defend against any encroachment. Gerard, busied with other concerns, did little to counter these acts of defiance. Gerard II and the crusade The new Archbishop, Gerard II, was determined to enforce orthodoxy on the Stedingers, as well as payment of the tax which his predecessor had neglected to collect. When a mendicant friar who was traveling through the territory proclaimed in a sermon that \\"Disobedience was idolatry,\\" he was attacked by the inhabitants, who then embarked on a spate of anti- clerical violence, sacking monasteries and killing clergy. The Archbishop, resolved on enforcing his demands, built Schlutterburg Castle on the border of the Stedinger territory, in which he installed his brother, Lord Herman II of Lippe. On Christmas of 1229 came the first battle between the peasantry and the knights of the Archbishop; Herman was killed, and the rest of the knights took in flight. On the 17th of March 1230, Gerard convened a council at Bremen, where the abbots and higher clergy of the archbishopric were to try the Stedingers for their refusal to obey feudal law, for rioting, sacrilege, and murder, and for allegedly worshipping images of wax, seeking counsel from soothsayers, and consorting with evil spirits. Having found the peasants guilty, the council decreed an interdict and the excommunication of all those who opposed the archbishop's decrees; the church doors were nailed shut and the priests left the territory. The archbishop himself went to Rome to persuade Pope Gregory IX to call for a crusade against the Stedingers. He succeeded in this and Dominican friars were dispatched throughout northern Germany to preach the crusade, for which the pope promised the same spiritual rewards as for the crusades in the Holy Land. In spring of 1233, a large number of German noblemen, supported by the citizenry, assembled for the campaign in Bremen. The population on the east bank of the Weser had not prepared adequate defenses, so the crusading army attacked there first, massacring most of the population; the few survivors were burnt at the stake. The crusaders then returned to Bremen to prepare the attack against the more heavily fortified west bank of the Weser. They made their assault on the West Stedingers on the 6th of July, 1233, but were repelled with heavy losses. In the winter of that year, Gerhard attempted to drown the rebels by having holes bored into the levees of the Weser to weaken them, but the workers were driven off by the levees' guards. In spring of the year 1234, the Dominicans throughout northern Germany preached a new crusade against the Stedingers. A large army was assembled at Bremen under the command of Henry I, Duke of Brabant, while Stedingers were led by Bolko von Bardenfleth, Tammo von Huntrop, and Detmar tom Diek. The Stedingers under Bolko von Bardenfleth advanced against the crusaders at one of the territory's fortified gates; neither side could gain a decisive advantage until a single crusading knight forced his armored war horse all the way to the rear of the peasant troop, thus opening a path for the other crusaders. The peasants were then quickly overwhelmed. The rest of the Stedingers had taken a position by Altenesch under Detmar tom Diek and Tammo von Huntrop, where they too were defeated after heavy resistance. As it was recorded in the Saxon Chronicle of Reppichau: \\"Thus the Stedingers met their end; because they had carried on for more than thirty-three years with great violence and injustice, our Lord God struck them down with His own violence.\\"Aldus namen de Stedinge eren ende, de grote gewalt unde unrecht hadden gedreven mer dan drittich unde dre jar, unse here got slog se do mit siner gewalt. Repgauische Chronik, p.88 (1859). Modern There are many people named Steding living today throughout northern Germany. In the Hameln region (on the south of the river Weser) there are Steding families, a Steding Shoe Store in Hessisch-Oldendorf, and a Steding Metzgerei (Butcher / Deli) in the old town of Hameln. The Steding families have moved throughout Germany. There are also Steding families living in the United States, most originally from this same region south of the river Weser (Hessisch-Oldendorf, Fuhlen).

Some of the land is located on the Flathead Indian Reservation (known as the Tribal Trust Lands of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes) and they continue to have claim over the land provided they assist in maintaining the resource. The Northwest Montana Wetland Management District is administered by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, an agency within the U.S. Department of the Interior. The individual lands were acquired beginning in 1970 by purchasing plots from willing landowners, and an ongoing effort to continue to increase area. Of the 200 species of birds reportedly observed on district lands, Canada goose, peregrine falcon, green-winged teal, meadowlark, owls, ring-necked pheasant, great blue heron and numerous species of ducks can be found here. Small mammals such as the porcupine, muskrat, mink, beaver and skunk are also common. Kalispell, Montana is within of many of the different locations.

It saw him win two caps for his country, as well as being a cricketer for Lancashire County Cricket Club who played in three Test matches for the England cricket team in 1909. Life From 1899 to 1914 Sharp played cricket regularly for Lancashire and played in every match of 1904 when the Championship was won without a defeat. After World War I he played as an amateur and captained the Lancashire side from 1923 to 1925. His position on the football pitch was right winger. After being signed from Aston Villa Sharp went on to be a Championship runner-up on three occasions with Everton, scored a goal in the club's 2‚Äì1 defeat to Sheffield Wednesday in the 1907 FA Cup Final and was an FA Cup winner one year previously against Newcastle United. His portrait appeared on 14 editions of cigarette packets, the mark of a popular sportsman at the time. When his playing career ended, Sharp became a director of Everton, a position he held for many years. He started a sports shop in Whitechapel Liverpool, which existed until the 1980s before being taken over by JJB Sports and later closed. There was also a shop in Chester, within the Grosvenor Precinct. His shop was the official supplier of playing strips to both Everton and Liverpool for many years. His brother, Bertram, was also a footballer with Aston Villa, Everton and Southampton who later became a director of Everton as well as a cricketer with Herefordshire County Cricket Club.

Earlier career and education Gono started his career as a tea boy at National Breweries in Que Que in 1977. He put himself through various correspondence courses from O-Level through A-Level and moved on to the Zimbabwe Fertiliser Company as a bookkeeper. After working at Van Leer as an accountant, he was appointed finance manager at the Zimbabwe Development Bank (ZDB) in 1987. When he left the Zimbabwe Development Bank in 1995, he had risen to the post of general manager. He went on to become managing director of the Bank of Credit and Commerce of Zimbabwe (BCCZ). Under his direction BCCZ became the largest and most successful bank in Zimbabwe, The Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe, or as he coined it, 'Jewel Bank'. He was subsequently appointed as governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. He obtained a master's degree in Business Administration at the University of Zimbabwe and went on to lecture there, and was also appointed to head the University of Zimbabwe Council. He was awarded an honorary degree at the same institution. He then went on to earn another PhD in Strategic Management in 2007 from Atlantic International University.Marc Abrahams, \\"Improbable research: the hundred trillion dollar book\\", The Guardian, 12 October 2009.  Reserve Bank governorship  Gono was first appointed as governor of the Reserve Bank in November 2003 because of his reputation as a turnaround specialist, particularly because of his work at the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe. In November 2008, Gono was reappointed to a new five-year term as governor, beginning on 1 December 2008.\\"Zimbabwe extends bank chief's tenure\\", AFP, 26 November 2008. Gono stepped down on 30 November 2013 after a 10-year term at the helm of the Reserve Bank. = Results of policies = After taking over the governorship of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe, Gono implemented a host of highly criticized policies in a bid to try to keep the Zimbabwe afloat. There were a host of problems before he became governor, hence the appointment of turnaround strategies but they seemed to be too much for him to tackle, hence the decline of the economy continued:\\"TO DR.

This went against the advice of global economists, but with full support from President Robert Mugabe. As predicted by the textbook quantity theory of money, this practice devalued the Zimbabwean dollar and caused hyperinflation. The RBZ demonetized old bank notes on 1 August 2006 and introduced a new currency. Each new Zimbabwe dollar was worth 1000 old Zimbabwe dollars.Slashes Zeros, AllAfrica, 1 August 2006 (subscription required) (accessed 2 August 2008) The highest denominations for the new currency were 1, 10, and 100 thousand revalued dollars. A year later on 1 August 2007, he authorized a 200 thousand dollar denomination. This marked the start of a series of new denominations issued in rapid succession, including 250, 500, and 750 thousand dollars (20 December 2007); 1, 5, and 10 million dollars (16 January 2008); 25 and 50 million dollars (4 April 2008); 100 and 250 million dollars (5 May 2008); 500 million and 5, 25, and 50 billion dollars (20 May 2008); and 100 billion dollars (21 July 2008). From the time of currency revaluation to the beginning of June 2008 the money supply in the country increased from billion to more than quadrillion, or a 20,000,000 fold increase. Gono denied media claims that he had opposed price cuts that the government instituted to arrest inflation. As time went by, it became apparent that the RBZ had instituted price cuts that saw bare shelves in shops and many businesses closing.\\"Gideon Gono: 'I'm not against price war'.

Backed by vice president Joyce Mujuru, Gono has several times called for an end to the farm invasions sanctioned by the ZANU-PF party, as these destroy the Zimbabwean economy. Gono's criticism of farm takeovers is in sharp contrast to statements made by other ministers, including Lands Minister Didymus Mutasa. In an interview with the state-controlled The Herald newspaper, he said, \\"I have openly condemned such retrogressive acts as destruction of horticultural greenhouses, decimation of tobacco barns, institution of fresh farm invasions\\".\\"Friends want me dead, claims Zim bank chief\\", Independent Online, 23 October 2006 \\"There are too many subdivisions among us, too many contradictions, too much infighting among ourselves, incredible suspicion and mistrust of one another,\\" Gono said. Gono admitted that his efforts to rescue and improve the economy of Zimbabwe were being thwarted and risked failure.\\"Zimbabwe's central bank chief admits failure\\" , New Zimbabwe.com, 3 November 2006 (accessed 2 August 2007) Gono said there were several factors that were outside the central bank's control, which made it difficult to reign in inflation. \\"Some of those factors are within the governor's control and influence while others such as politics, sanctions, droughts, under-utilisation of farms, disruptions at those farms, rampant corruption, indiscipline, law and order are factors outside the governor's control,\\" he said in an interview with The Herald newspaper.\\"Zim losing inflation battle\\" , News24, 23 October 2006 He has also blamed the failure of the economy on sanctions imposed on the country, a charge critics dispute.\\"Dr Gideon Gono: How Sanctions are ruining Zimbabwe\\", African Business, 1 June 2007 (accessed 2 August 2008) Critics allege that Gono has kept his job as the governor mainly through Mugabe's patronage saying Mugabe has not only shielded Gono from critics, but has commended him in his activities as governor despite the extreme deterioration of the Zimbabwean economy.Leave Gono alone, AllAfrica, 26 July 2006 (subscription required) (accessed 2 August 2008) He had been Mugabe's banker for a long period before becoming governor of the RBZ.\\"Gideon Gono‚Äôs star starting to fade\\", Zimbabwe Review, 30 December 2007 (accessed 2 August 2008) Personal life Like many of Mugabe's inner circle, Gono also owns a farm (in Norton). However, unlike others, he is said to have bought and paid for it in the late 1990s before the land redistribution program in which other farms were confiscated from localised white farmers. In November 2008, Gono published a book titled Zimbabwe's Casino Economy: Extra-ordinary Measures for Extra-ordinary Challenges describing the post-colonial economy of Zimbabwe particularly during the first five years (2003‚Äì2008) of his term as Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ). On 24 October 2010, the South-African newspaper Sunday Times ran a story falsely claiming that he had an affair with Amai Grace Mugabe, the wife of President Robert Mugabe. It was later reported that the story could have been made up as a part of internal fighting inside the ruling party or the RBZ. =Personal sanctions= Gono is banned from travelling to the United States because of his then influential position in government-owned institutions in Zimbabwe, namely the Commercial Bank of Zimbabwe where he was the CEO and subsequently, the Central Bank where he was the Governor of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. He was added to and subsequently removed from the EU's list of individuals subject to personal sanctions and the ban on travel to the EU was lifted in 2013 after he retired from Government service. He however is still on the US sanctions list. He had no assets frozen by the EU sanctions.

A victim of \\"anti-Rightist\\" purges, he spent his later life in prisons and reeducation centres. The recovery and publication of Gu's prison diaries and theoretical writings caused a sensation in intellectual circles when published in the mid 1990s. Having spent his life as a highly trained economist with Marxist convictions and heroic career as a revolutionary, his fall from grace and savage punishment led him to develop an authentic and deeply personal conversion to the values of liberal democracy. Cut off from the mainstream of 20th century Western thought, he in a sense \\"reinvented the wheel\\" of liberal theory. While certain critics have disparaged his ideas as \\"laughable if translated into English,\\" from a Chinese liberal perspective he represents a rare case of authentic invention of liberalism, relatively free of suspect foreign influences. Gu was an accountancy expert in his youth, joining the underground Communist Party in Shanghai in the late 1930s, and later appointed to leading roles in the post- Liberation Shanghai tax administration. However, having given outspoken and unwelcome advice to senior cadres, he was in 1952 charged with counter- revolutionary tendencies, demoted and sentenced to \\"remoulding.\\" In each of the succeeding cycles of Leftist-inspired purges Gu's \\"Rightist\\" label was reimposed and his punishments renewed. Rehabilitated in a brief period of political relaxation in the early 1960s, he was rescued from his pariah status by the economist Sun Yefang, with whom he had been associated in the Shanghai underground movement. Sun arranged a research position for Gu in the Institute of Economics of the Philosophy and Social Science Section (Xuebu, Â≠¶ÈÉ®) of the Chinese Academy of Science (CAS). The Xuebu was to form the core of the Chinese Academy of Social Science (CASS) when it was split off from CAS in 1977. Many senior figures in CASS, such as the economist Wu Jinglian, were formatively influenced by Gu Zhun during this period. The Cultural Revolution once again submerged people with Rightist backgrounds. Gu was again subjected to harsh punitive treatment, losing contact with his wife and children. His main contact with the outside world was with his brother Chen Minzhi () (1920-). Contemporary intellectual historians like Zhu Xueqin have hailed Gu Zhun's oeuvre as a major resource for contemporary Chinese liberalism. Li Shenzhi, a Vice-President of CASS and noted liberal activist, wrote of Gu Zhun as a man who \\"set himself ablaze to illuminate others.‚Äù Critics decry this as exaggeration, pointing to the limits of Gu's intellectual range. Main economic thought (Most of his works were written in 1973 and 1974.) *He raised questions that his contemporaries did not dare to, and tried to give some tentative answers. In this process, he gradually moved away from the idealism still active in communist doctrine, and rediscovered Anglo-American empiricism and the value of liberty intrinsic to it. * At a time when dogmas of central planning predominated, he was among the world pioneers of the idea that socialism should incorporate market economics. In arguing that socialism aimed at a \\"good market economy\\" as distinct from the \\"bad ones‚Äù found in capitalist systems, he emphasised the values of the rule of law and constitutionalism. *In 1965, Gu Zhun was forced to work in Xinyang, Henan province. During Mao‚Äôs period, some 200,000 people died of hunger in that region. There were even cases of cannibalism. Shocked by what he saw, Gu began to ask how communist idealism could be the doctrinal source of such horrors, and how such tragedy could be avoided in future. He wrote, > ‚Äú‚Ä¶ today people turn idealism into dogmas in the name of revolution, hence I > am turning absolutely to empiricism and pluralism, and democracy.‚Äù *In his article \\"On Commercial Production and the Theory of Value under Socialism\\" (1957), he insisted that the market, rather than a central Plan, should be the basis of productive decisions. Planning could not be expected to encompass everything, to interfere in detail with processes of production and transfer, let alone to perform with complete precision. At a time in which Karl Marx and Mao Zedong were accredited with quasi-divine wisdom, and their dicta treated as infallible, unquestionable and unalterable, Gu Zhun's new model of planning was nothing short of heresy. At that time, had an ordinary person been reported to have raised such ideas, they would have been put into prison, even executed. These, however, were the views that enlightened later key economists such as Sun Yewang and Wu Jinglian and form the core of the post-Mao reforms Why did capitalism arise in Britain? *Britain inherited technologies accumulated from the Renaissance onward, gathered experience in management, navigation developed in the 16th century, trade, and the advantageous consequences of colonization. * a United Kingdom was founded whose basic policy was to protect the expansion of commercial interests * The United Kingdom expanded immensely through colonization. However, the goal was not to establish a Roman style empire like Napoleon, but to establish a Greek style colonial order which was relatively independent of the mother country. * Business adopted the form of monopolistic companies (the East Indian company, the South China Sea company, etc.), consisting mostly of entrepreneurially-minded aristocrats. In the mid 19th century, Mill emphasized in his works that it was not appropriate for the state to manage business directly. These had in fact been standard British government views since the 17th century. * (China was just the opposite, with monopolies in salt and iron from the Han Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty. Traditionally, all these enterprises were controlled and managed by the central government). * The effects of different approaches to war. The Napoleonic war, won by England and lost by France, was Gu Zhun's example. France, whose historical heritage was in many ways similar to Britain's, adopted standard dynastic policies. Virtually without exception these led to the suppression of development. In Britain, on the other hand, wars led to the accumulation of wealth, leading ultimately to the industrial revolution. Imperialism (the \\"highest level of capitalism,\\" according to Lenin) failed to follow the path predicted by Lenin, just as capitalism had not developed according to the predictions of Karl Marx. Marx had predicted inevitable demise of capitalism, on the grounds that: # The core of capitalism ‚áí multiplication of capital ‚áí high profit ‚áí lower wages ‚áí insufficient consumption ‚áí creates panic; # Moreover, when the organic composition of capital increases, the commensurable surplus value performance for the increasingly lowed capital profit margin. Thus, the margin profit on capital tends to zero: capitalism cannot persist in the long run and will die eventually; # In social structural terms, capital tends to be centralised. As more and more capitalists are deprived, contradictions between capital and private ownership will increase. Socialism will finally only require a slight effort. # These predictions were belied by the realities of the early 20th century, making it necessary for Lenin to offer a modified theory. Unfortunately, this too failed to be confirmed. The Great Depression that followed the economic crisis of 1929 (the third \\"international\\" general crisis of the 1930s) encouraged a rediscovery of Marx. Now 40 years had gone by (i.e. to the time of Gu Zhun's writing), but no repeat of the Great Depression has taken place and it was unlikely that it ever would. Why? The reason for capitalism's great vitality is, apart from new technology, products and materials; and big companies, governments and trade union; and in addition to its pluralistic philosophy, academic freedom and democratic politics, is that it did not limit, but tried to develop critique. Capitalism may be a pile of evil, but this fact is constantly exposed, and given unceasingly attention. Improvements great or small can thus be made. Hence, capitalism was enabled to continue; \\"‚Ä¶I see that the capitalism cannot be extinguished through violent revolution, because of its improvement through critique . ‚Ä¶\\" See also *Chinese philosophy References  *Yinhang kuaiji [Banking Accountancy] Shanghai: Commercial Press 1930. \\"Èì∂Ë°å‰ºöËÆ°\\" *Chuji shangye buji jiaokeshu [Elementary commercial bookkeeping textbook]\\"ÂàùÁ∫ßÂïÜ‰∏öÁ∞øËÆ∞ÊïôÁßë‰π¶\\" *Buji chujie [Elementary bookkeeping] \\"Á∞øËÆ∞ÂàùÈò∂\\" *Gufen youxian gongsi kuaiji [Limited company accounting] \\"ËÇ°‰ªΩÊúâÈôêÂÖ¨Âè∏‰ºöËÆ°\\" *Zhonghua yinhang kuaiji zhidu [Accounting systems of Chinese banks]\\"‰∏≠ÂçéÈì∂Ë°å‰ºöËÆ°Âà∂Â∫¶\\" *Suode shui yuanli yu shiwu [principles and practice of income tax] () *Zhonghua zhengfu kuaiji zhidu [Accounting systems of Chinese government] () *Chen Minzhi, Wo yu Guzhun [Gu Zhun and me], Shanghai: Shanghai Wenyi chubanshe,2003 (). *Luo Yinsheng, Gu Zhun huazhuan [Illustrated biography of Gu Zhun], Beijing Tuanjie chubanshe 2005 (). *Gu Zhun quanji [Complete works of Gu Zhun], Guiyang: Guizhou People's Press, 1994 (). *Gu Zhun riji [Diary of Gu Zhun], Beijing Jingji ribao chubanshe 1997 () *\\"\\" [On commercial production and the theory of value under socialism] ([Economic Research] 1957, no. 3) *\\"\\" [Several theoretical problems of accounting under socialism] (1978) *\\"\\" [From Idealism to Empiricism] (1974) *\\"The city-state Constitution of Greece\\" (written 1974?

Bird's fame as a cricketer in the years before the First World War rested more on his deeds as a schoolboy than on his prowess as a county or Test player. In 1907, as captain of the Harrow School team, he scored two centuries in the annual match at Lord's against Eton College that was one of the social highlights of the year. He played a few games for Lancashire that season, then disappeared for two years, reappearing in 1909 with Surrey. On a fairly flimsy record, he was taken by H. D. G. Leveson Gower on the 1909‚Äì10 English tour of South Africa, where he played in all five Tests. He took three wickets for 11 runs in his first Test against South Africa at Johannesburg and in the third Test he put on 95 for the seventh wicket with Jack Hobbs, a stand that enabled England to win the match by three wickets. In the fourth match at Cape Town he scored 57 in the first innings. Back in England, Bird played regularly for Surrey in 1910 and took over as the county's captain from Leveson-Gower for two years from 1911. A forceful right-handed batsman, he scored 1,000 runs in three seasons and also took useful wickets with medium-pace bowling. But he appears never to have been in serious contention for a Test place until selected again for a South African tour in 1913‚Äì14, under Johnny Douglas. He made his highest Test score, 61, in the first Test at Durban, putting on 115 for the seventh wicket with Douglas, but achieved little else in the series until he took the first three wickets in South Africa's second innings in the final match, played at Port Elizabeth. Bird played only a few first-class matches after the First World War, and coached at his old school and later at Surrey. He was ill for several years before his death at the age of 45.

Tall and gangling, and with a toothcomb moustache, Percy Buckenham was a fast bowler and a useful lower order batsman. He played for Essex from 1899 to 1914, but suffered, particularly in his early years, from slipshod fielding which meant, according to his obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack, he was more expensive than he perhaps deserved. His career average, at more than 25, is high for the era in which he played. The 1906 season was the first in which he took more than 100 wickets, and he played several representative matches over the next few English seasons without breaking into the Test match team in England. He was picked in the squad for the fifth Test at The Oval against the 1909 Australians, but was then left out of the team: his omission was described by Sydney Pardon, editor of Wisden, as \\"a fatal blunder\\" and the selectors' decision not to include a fast bowler at all \\"touched the confines of lunacy\\". Buckenham's only Test experience came on the 1909-10 tour to South Africa, under the captaincy of H. D. G. Leveson Gower. In four Tests, he took 21 wickets at 28 runs apiece, including five for 115 in the first South African innings of the third Test at Johannesburg. But though he had his most productive season in 1911, with 134 first-class wickets, he was considered too old for the 1911-12 tour to Australia. Buckenham was a good amateur footballer and played county soccer for Essex. He played right-back for the Upton Park F.C. team that won the inaugural Olympic football tournament in 1900. Buckenham retired in 1914 to become professional at the Scottish club Forfarshire and after serving with Royal Garrison Artillery in the First World War he became cricket coach at Repton School.

Paul D. Petsu, 2002, \\"USS Sides pays tribute to Broome‚Äôs One Day War\\" (U.S. Seventh Fleet website.), accessed 18 April 2007. The number of refugees has previously been given as 8,000, but new research by Dr Tom Lewis contends that this figure is massively overstated. The figure was first quoted in the relevant Australian Official War History and has been reproduced in many publications since.Lewis & Ingman (2010) The actual number of aerial evacuees passing through Broome at this time is estimated to have been only 1,350. Most of these were military personnel. There were approximately 250 Dutch civilian refugees, most of whom were family members of Dutch aircrews.Gillison, Douglas. Royal Australian Air Force 1939‚Äì1942, Australia in the War of 1939‚Äì1945, Series Three Air, Volume I. Australian War Memorial: Canberra, 1962, pp. 463‚Äì468 The attack Lt Zenjiro Miyano‚Äîthe commander of Dai 3 K≈çk≈´tai (3rd Air Group) of the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service‚Äîled nine Mitsubishi A6M2 Zero fighters and a Mitsubishi C5M2 reconnaissance plane from their base at Kupang, Timor in the attack, on the morning of 3 March. From about 09:20, the Zeros made strafing attacks on the flying boat anchorage at Roebuck Bay and the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) base at Broome Airfield. No bombs were dropped, although some were reported, perhaps a result of witnesses seeing the Zero pilots releasing their drop tanks. The raid lasted an hour. The Japanese fighters destroyed at least 22 Allied aircraft. These included an airborne United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) B-24A Liberator, full of wounded personnel‚Äînearly 20 died when it crashed in the sea, about off Broome.https://www.ozatwar.com/wa12.htm The Allies also lost 15 flying boats at anchorage; many Dutch refugees were on board and the exact number and identities of all those killed is unknown but the ages and names of some were recorded when they were moved from Broome to the Perth War Cemetery at Karrakatta in 1950 (the known casualties include 9 children, the youngest being just 1). At the airfield, the Japanese fighters destroyed two B-17E Flying Fortresses and a B-24 belonging to the USAAF, two Lockheed Hudsons belonging to the RAAF and a Lockheed Lodestar belonging to the Royal Netherlands East Indies Air Force (ML-KNIL). The aircraft destroyed included: eight PBY Catalinas operated by the Royal Australian Air Force, the Royal Netherlands Navy Air Service (MLD), United States Navy and the Royal Air Force; two Short Empires belonging to the RAAF and QANTAS, and five Dornier Do 24s belonging to the MLD. A USAAF B-24 Liberator on fire at Broome Airfield following the attack. A KLM Douglas DC-3 airliner‚ÄîPK-AFV (carrying refugees from Bandung)‚Äîwas also shot down, north of Broome, with the loss of four lives and diamonds worth ¬£150,000 ‚Äì 300,000 (now approximately A$20‚Äì40 million). There were no Allied fighter planes based in Broome at the time. The Zeroes encountered some light arms fire from the ground. One Zero pilot‚ÄîWarrant Officer Osamu Kud≈ç‚Äîwas killed by ground fire from a Dutch ML-KNIL pilot, First Lieutenant Gus Winckel, using a 7.9mm machine gun he had removed from his Lodestar. Winckel balanced the weapon on his shoulder and sustained burns to his left forearm when it touched the barrel of the gun after firing. Another Zero ran out of fuel and ditched while returning to his base, although the pilot survived. In 2010, new research argued instead that Kudo's Zero was shot down by the tail guns in the B-24A Arabian Knight, which itself was downed by Kudo's attack with the loss of 19 of the 20 American military personnel on board. Aftermath Following the attack, an RAAF officer‚ÄîPilot Officer Frank Russell, who had been on one of the flying boats during the raid‚Äîwrote of Charlie D'Antoine‚Äîan Aboriginal flying boat refueller‚Äîhelped two passengers from the planes to reach the shore, swimming through burning fuel and wreckage.ABC-TV, \\"Broome Hero\\" (Message Stick, 5 February 2006), accessed 18 April 2007. D'Antoine later received a bravery award from the Dutch government and was invited to attend a royal reception in the Netherlands. At least one U.S. serviceman‚ÄîSgt. Melvin Donoho‚Äîmanaged to swim about from the crashed B-24 to shore, a journey which took him more than 36 hours. Some accounts say that a Sgt. Willard J. Beatty also made it ashore but died soon afterwards; other sources suggest that this was a false report, emanating from one newspaper article.Western Australian Museum (no date), \\"The B24 Liberator crash\\", accessed 18 April 2007.

William Fisk Harrah: The Life and Times of a Gambling Magnate. Doubleday & Company, Inc. . It is owned by CAI Investments, which plans to renovate the building as a mixed-use development named Reno City Center. It is credited for being the first property of the Harrah's casino chain, founded by William F. Harrah. History William F. Harrah opened his first bingo parlor on October 29, 1937, but by December 1937, that parlor was closed. Harrah then spent the winter raising money and re-opened his casino, now called the Heart Tango. The Heart Tango location was between Virginia and Center streets, in the heart of the Reno casino action. Over time, Harrah slowly acquired neighboring casinos adjacent to his Virginia Street casino. Harrah slowly built his operation. In 1968, he acquired The Reno Golden Hotel and contracted noted casino architect Martin Stern Jr. to create and construct a luxury 24‚Äìstory hotel tower to build atop the bones of the former Grand Hotel. The tower opened on October 10, 1969. In 1981, a 100-room tower was added to the existing 24-story tower by the new owners Holiday Inn. Harrah's had a showroom that hosted the same top headliners as those who appeared in Las Vegas, such as Joan Rivers, Smothers Brothers, Merle Haggard, Frank Sinatra, Wayne Newton, Captain and Tennille and Mitzi Gaynor. In 1991, after the death of Sammy Davis Jr., the Headliner Room name was changed to Sammy's Showroom. Davis had performed at Harrah's regularly and was the opening night act in the Headliner Room. Sammy's Showroom opened with a dual headliner and revue acts. Over the years, Sammy's has switched to a revue show-only policy. Headliners in the first years of the re-christened Sammy's Showroom included Vic Damone, Tony Bennett, Rich Little, Phyllis Diller, Marilyn McCoo and Norm Crosby. The last headliner to appear in Sammy's Showroom was Gordie Brown in 2004. In 1995, Harrah's Entertainment was spun off from Promus Hotel Company (formerly Holiday Inn) and built the world's largest Hampton Inn, one of its signature hotel brands, next door to the Reno hotel. The Reno Hampton Inn hotel opened in November 1995. The Hampton Inn at Harrah's Reno was connected to the casino floor and included its own hotel lobby, valet and meeting facilities. During the Reno Truckee River flood of 1997, both the Hampton Inn and Harrah's had to be closed due to water damage. In 1999, the Promus Company was sold to the Hilton Hotels Corporation. Harrah's acquired the 26-story Hampton addition and made that hotel a seamless part of Harrah's, adding 400 rooms to its room count. In 1999, Harrah's purchased the closed older casinos of the Nevada Club and Harold's Club and soon imploded both aging casinos to make room for a grand outdoor entertainment venue, called The Plaza. Opened in 2000 as a concert venue, the first year shows included Ray Charles, KC and the Sunshine Band and Chuck Berry. The VIP seats in the Plaza were given to casino guests and also sold. The area also had free seating. Concerts could be heard all along Virginia Street. Harrah's remodeled the East Tower (formerly called the Hampton Inn) in 2003 and the original West Tower from 2005 to 2006. Harrah's has left the famed Harrah's Steak House, its most recognizable restaurant that founder Harrah built on May 26, 1967, virtually untouched. Major interior casino and meeting room renovations took place in 1995, 1999 and 2006. The Carvings Buffet (formerly Fresh Square Market Buffet) was opened on February 24, 2006, after it was closed in August 2005 for renovations which cost $6 or $10 million dollars to renovate the buffet restaurant. In early 2011, hotel management decided to begin investing in certain worn areas of the hotel property to refurbish them. Starting in late 2010, executive management decided to return to the use of \\"wall-wash\\" exterior lighting to bathe the hotel towers in bright purple, the official color of the Harrah's brand. In February 2011, it closed its age-old Cafe' Napa coffee shop which was opened in June 1999 and was replaced with a Hash House a go go restaurant. Pool area on the fifth floor (2019) On October 6, 2017, ownership of the Harrah's Reno property was transferred to Vici Properties as part of a corporate spin-off and it was leased back to Caesars Entertainment. In January 2020, Caesars and Vici announced that they would sell Harrah's Reno to CAI Investments, a Las Vegas-based real estate firm. CAI intended to close the property and convert it into a non-gaming hotel, along with mixed-use development. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Harrah's Reno was among businesses that were ordered by Governor Steve Sisolak to close on March 17, 2020, to prevent the spread of the virus. In June 2020, Caesars announced that it would not reopen Harrah's Reno. The sale was finalized in September, with Vici receiving 75 percent of the $41.5 million sale price, and Caesars receiving the other 25 percent. CAI will rename the property Reno City Center. It will include 540 apartments.

Early life Thompson was born in Woodbridge in Suffolk, England, the second of seven children of George Thompson and his wife Elizabeth (n√©e Miles). George Thompson was a builder and the Suffolk county surveyor, descended from a family of farmers in the nearby village of Bredfield. Francis' grandfather Jacob was also a builder and two of his uncles were architects. Thompson attended Woodbridge Grammar School and his family's background instilled him with an interest in architecture. He married Anna Maria Watson on 17 May 1830 in Woodbridge church. The couple soon emigrated to Montreal in British North America (now in Quebec, Canada). Their son, Francis Jacob, was born the following year. Anna died of cholera in 1832 as a result of the second cholera pandemic, a global outbreak which killed 4,000 people in Montreal. Thompson designed multiple houses, commercial buildings, courts, and a church. In 1832, he worked with John Wells (another English emigrant) to build St. Anne's Market, which was temporarily used for the pre-confederation Canadian parliament. Thompson returned to England in 1837, prompted by growing friction between French and British settlers. Railway work Although at first sight Thompson was young and inexperienced, Robert Stephenson the engineer for the North Midland Railway (NMR), recruited him to be the railway company's architect in February 1839. The North Midland was in the early stages of building its line north from Derby to Leeds. He designed many publicly acclaimed buildings, including multiple railway stations and warehouses. In Derby, he designed a compete railway town, featuring Derby Trijunct station (opened 1840), the meeting point for three railway companies. The station had a three-bay glazed train shed and a two- storey, red-brick frontage in an Italianate style, described as \\"the first really great station\\".Lloyd & Insall, pp. 8‚Äì9. Thompson was also responsible for a cluster of buildings around the station, including a roundhouse, terraced houses for the workers, and the Midland Hotel, which is among the most representative of his surviving works. The group was the world's first complete complex of railway buildings. The station was remodelled several times in the intervening century and almost completely rebuilt in the 1980s. Thompson designed several smaller stations for the NMR, including Belper and Eckington, both since rebuilt, and Wingfield (which remains largely intact) and Ambergate (where Thompson's original building survives but has been superseded by newer buildings). Notable for his criticism of the extravagant nature of the railway architecture of the day, Whishaw nevertheless praised Thompson's works in Derby, writing: > The admirably contrived and elegant roofs, the spacious platforms, the great > length of the whole erection extending to upwards of a thousand feet. All > unite in rendering it the most complete structure of the kind in the United > Kingdom or perhaps the world.Whishaw, F., (1840) The Railways of Great > Britain and Ireland: Practically described and illustrated London: Simpkin, > Marshall and Co. Holywell Junction station which is Italianate and Grade II* listed. Thompson and Stephenson went on to work together on the Chester and Holyhead Railway, for which Thompson designed the architectural elements of the Britannia Bridge over the Menai Strait as well as the Italianate Chester railway station, the frontage of which closely resembles the original station at Derby. The bridge was largely destroyed by fire in 1970, though Thompson's masonry work was incorporated into the rebuilt structure. Among his other works on the line were the stations at Holywell Junction, Flint, and Mostyn (now disused), Conwy, and Bangor.Lloyd & Insall, p. 14. Thompson was also the architect on the Conwy Railway Bridge, including making the towers castellated in order to match the nearby 13th-century Conwy Castle. The Britannia and Menai bridges both used Stephenson's pioneering tubular design. Cambridge railway station, along with Great Chesterford and Audley End on the Eastern Counties Railway, were initially credited to Sancton Wood but are now believed to be the work of Thompson.Lloyd & Insall, Introduction. Canada again Thompson remarried in 1840. His second wife, Elizabeth, died in 1852, and on 30 June 1853, he married Mary Ann Groves, from Wareham, Dorset. The couple sailed for Canada, and Thompson took up employment with the Grand Trunk Railway and the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad. He designed Union station in Portland, Maine, which was claimed to be the largest station in America when it opened in 1855. He also designed the masonry for the Victoria Bridge in Montreal, another Stephenson-designed tubular bridge, as well as multiple other stations and railway workshops. The Thompsons returned to London in April 1859. In 1866, he retired to a house he built in Hastings in Sussex, before finally moving home to Bredfield in Suffolk, where he died on 23 April 1895. He was buried in the local cemetery. Although well paid during his career, retirement rained Thompson's wealth and he died in poverty without leaving a will.

In politics, \\"carrot or stick\\" sometimes refers to the realist concept of soft and hard power. The carrot in this context could be the promise of economic or diplomatic aid between nations, while the stick might be the threat of military action.  Origin  The earliest English-language references to the \\"carrot and stick\\" come from authors in the mid-1800s who in turn wrote in reference to a \\"caricature\\" or cartoon of the time that depicted a race between donkey riders, with the losing jockey using the strategy of beating his steed with \\"blackthorn twigs\\" to urge it forward, while the winner of the race sits in his saddle relaxing and holding the butt end of his baited stick. In fact, in some oral traditions, turnips were used instead of carrots as the donkey's temptation. Decades later, the idea appeared in a letter from Winston Churchill, dated July 6, 1938: \\"Thus, by every device from the stick to the carrot, the emaciated Austrian donkey is made to pull the Nazi barrow up an ever-steepening hill.\\" The Southern Hemisphere caught up in 1947 and 1948 amid Australian newspaper commentary about the need to stimulate productivity following World War II. The earliest uses of the idiom in widely available U.S. periodicals were in The Economist's December 11, 1948 issue and in a Daily Republic newspaper article that same year that discussed Russia's economy. In the German language, the idiom translates as sugar bread and whip.  Examples  The broadly accepted \\"carrot or stick\\" concept. In the years leading up to World War II and during the war itself, Joseph Stalin applied the \\"carrot or stick\\" principle among the nations of the Soviet Sphere of Influence in order to establish tighter control over them. For example, in 1934, Stalin reversed his decision to attack the socialists of the region, instead allowing them to join the \\"People's Front Against Fascism and War.\\" Despite this alliance's limited success when it came to strategies against the fascism of Nazi Germany, Stalin had effectively replaced the \\"stick\\" of aggression that he had been using against the socialists with the \\"carrot\\" of a better deal for them: membership in a more sweeping system of Popular Fronts against the Axis. Stalin's use of reward and punishment, as described above, has not been unique in the world arena. A casual survey of international news confirms that the tactic is still in common use today, by people in power up to and including the presidents of the United States and NATO. The carrot and stick as metaphor could be applied to the conduct of the Chinese during the Ming treasure voyages in the 15th century. The carrot was trade opportunity and the stick was the overwhelming naval power that the Ming Chinese expeditionary fleet could bring upon recalcitrant rulers. Diplomatic relationships were based on a mutually beneficial maritime commerce and a visible presence of a Chinese militaristic naval force in foreign waters. The Chinese naval superiority was a crucial factor in this interaction, namely because it was inadvisable to risk punitive action from the Chinese fleet. Meanwhile, the worthwhile and profitable nature of the Ming treasure voyages for foreign countries was a persuading factor to comply.

He is remembered as a model of honesty and integrity in office. A play based on his career, Hai Rui Dismissed from Office, gained political significance in the 1960s during the Cultural Revolution. Biography Statue of Hai Rui Hai Rui, was born in Qiongshan, Hainan on January 23, 1513. His father died when he was three, and he was raised by his mother. His great-great-grandfather was a native of Guangzhou named Hai Da-er (Êµ∑Á≠îÂÖí, Haidar, an Arabic name), and his mother was from a Muslim (Hui) family that originated from the Indian subcontinent. Hai Rui himself however was noted primarily as a Neo-Confucian and never discussed Islam in his Confucian works. Hai took the Imperial examination but was unsuccessful, and his official career only began in 1553, when he was 39, with a humble position as clerk of education in Fujian. He gained a reputation for his uncompromising adherence to upright morality, scrupulous honesty, poverty, and fairness. This won him widespread popular support, evinced among other things by his being enshrined while alive; but he also made many enemies in the bureaucracy. Nevertheless, he was called to the capital Beijing and promoted to the junior position of secretary of ministry of Revenue. In 1565, he submitted a memorial strongly criticizing the Jiajing Emperor for the neglect of his duties and bringing disaster to the country, for which he was sentenced to death in 1566. He was released after the Emperor died in early 1567. Hai Rui was reappointed under the Longqing Emperor but soon forced to resign in 1570 after complaints were made over his overzealous handling of land-tenure issues. He then spent 15 years in retirement in Hainan before being finally brought back to the Empire's \\"auxiliary capital\\" of Nanjing, in 1585, to serve under the Wanli Emperor. Hai Rui was promoted to censor-in- chief of Nanjing in 1586, but died in office a year later. Legacy Tomb of Hai Rui Hai Rui memorial in Haikou In 1959, writer and scholar Wu Han became interested in the life of Hai Rui, and wrote several articles on his life and his fearless criticism of the emperor. He then wrote a play for Peking Opera titled \\"Hai Rui Dismissed from Office\\", which he revised several times before the final version of 1961. Wu's play was interpreted by the Gang of Four member Yao Wenyuan as an allegorical work, in which the honest moral official Hai Rui representing the disgraced communist marshal Peng Dehuai, who was purged by Mao after criticizing the Great Leap Forward. According to Yao, the corrupt emperor in Wu's play represented Mao Zedong. The November 10, 1965, an article in a prominent Shanghai newspaper, \\"A Criticism of the Historical Drama 'Hai Rui Dismissed From Office'\\" (), written by Yao, began a propaganda campaign that eventually led to the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, the tomb of Hai Rui was destroyed, Hai Rui's body dug up and incinerated by Red Guards (the tomb has since been rebuilt).Roderick MacFarquhar, The Red Terror: Mao's Last Revolution (Cambridge: Harvard University, 2006) p. 120. Yao's campaign led to the persecution and death of Wu Han, as well as others involved in related works, such as Zhou Xinfang for his opera Hai Rui Submits His Memorial (). While Wu Han considers Hai Rui to be a moral socialist, this was not necessarily the case. As historian Ray Huang puts it, \\"Though one might expect the moral interpretation of history to be generally discredited by now, this is not the case. Some modern historians tend to view the Confucian morality in of certain individuals in terms of the own sense of social justice. Wu Han, for instance, praises his hero Hai Jui for ‚Äòstanding on the side of peasantry‚Äô in their conflict with the landlords. He also asserts that Hai, ‚Äòdespite a hundred setbacks, still continued the struggle to build a socialist society.\\" Haikou, the largest city on Hai Rui's home island of Hainan, celebrates Hai Rui's deeds. A memorial has been constructed and his tomb is open for worship.

Life and career Parkin played one first-class match for Yorkshire in 1906, before it was discovered that he was born twenty yards outside the county boundary. Despite the fact that many cricketers had appeared for Yorkshire who were not born inside the county boundaries he then spent the next 8 years playing league and minor counties cricket for Durham. From 1910 he represented Church CC in the Lancashire League, taking 685 wickets in six seasons at an average of 8.27. He then joined Lancashire and played at Old Trafford from 1914 to 1926, although four of these years were lost to the Great War. He was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1924. He was a mercurial, inventive off spinner who used flight, guile and turn to dismiss batsman and demanded attacking fields from his captains. He could be expensive, as he disdained any policy of containment against good batsmen on flat pitches and was criticised for over experimentation, but at his best he could run through any side. In 1921 he was described as the best bowler in England. He took 14 Leicestershire County Cricket Club wickets on his debut for the Red Rose at Liverpool in 1914, when he was already 28, and did not become a full-time cricketer until the age of 34 in 1921, the year he topped the Test averages against Warwick Armstrong's mighty Australian side. Before then he had combined his Saturday league commitments for Rochdale CC with appearances for Lancashire. He took 14 wickets in the 1919 Roses Match at Old Trafford at just 10 apiece and, in the first innings of the Gentlemen v Players match of 1920 dismissed 9 Gentlemen at the Oval, six clean bowled, for 85. He was picked for England's tour of Australia that winter and took 5 for 60 in the first innings at Adelaide in a difficult rubber for the England team. He was England's most successful bowler in all first-class games on the tour however, with 73 at 21 each. In all he played 8 Tests against Australia without ever appearing on the winning side. He is one of the few players to have opened both the bowling and batting, against Australia at Old Trafford, for England, a remarkable performance by a spin bowler who played only 10 games. He was known as a great character in the dressing room but his outspoken views often saw him clash with the cricketing authorities of the time. He was dropped from the England team when he criticised England Captain Arthur Gilligan in a newspaper article and fell out with the Lancashire Committee two years later which ended his first-class career. After leaving Lancashire he returned to league cricket and continued to prove a heavy wicket taker for many years. He was Lancashire's best bowler in 1923, taking 209 wickets at 16.94, and 1924, 200 at just 13.67, but in 1925 took 'only' 121 wickets at 20.79. Ted McDonald and Dick Tyldesley began to dominate the attack for the powerful Lancashire team as they sought to end Yorkshire's dominance of the County Championship. His benefit match with Middlesex in 1925 realised ¬£1,880 and in 1926 he played in eleven county matches, taking 36 wickets at 15.13 and helped Lancashire win the championship for the first time since 1904. Sadly a dispute with the powers that be saw his first-class career end at 40. He was equally unorthodox and inventive as a batsman, if rather less skilled, but plucky even if a risky runner between the wickets. He wrote lively accounts of his cricketing days and was, characteristically, a talented conjurer and magician. He used to experiment with new deliveries by bowling them at his wife in the nets and occasionally sent her home with bruised fingers.

Its primary goal is to promote efforts to fulfill international commitments made on water and water related issues . In the United Nations Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) by 2015. In March, 2019, the United Nations General Assembly declared the years 2018-2028 as the Water Action Decade. In order to help to achieve the internationally agreed water-related goals contained in the United Nations Millennium Declaration, and in Agenda 21 and the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation of the World Summit of Sustainable Development (WSSD) the Decade focuses on water-related issues at all levels and on the implementation of programmes and projects, and the furtherance of cooperation at all levels. During the first UN Decade on Water from 1981‚Äì1990, it is estimated that more than a billion people gained access to safe drinking water. The primary goal of the 'Water for Life' Decade is to promote efforts to fulfill international commitments made on water and water-related issues by 2015. These commitments include the Millennium Development Goals to reduce by half the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015 and to stop unsustainable exploitation of water resources. At the World Summit in Johannesburg in 2002, two other goals were adopted: to aim to develop integrated water resource management and water efficiency plans by 2005 and to halve, by 2015, the proportion of people who do not have access to basic sanitation. World Water Day, 22 March 2005, marked the official commencement of the ‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô Decade. Themes Central water related themes include: food, health, environment, disaster prevention, energy, transboundary water issues, scarcity, culture, sanitation, pollution and agriculture. As women play a central role in water provision and management, a special emphasis will be placed on ensuring the participation and involvement of women in these development efforts. Activities An up-to-date Calendar of Events has the latest on the activities planned throughout the Decade.http://www.unesco.org/water/water_events/Date At the national level, it is expected that each country will take its own approach to organize activities around the ‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô Decade. All activities that promote public awareness of issues related to the ‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô theme are encouraged, including the organization of conferences, seminars, expositions and other such public events. Organizers UN-Water is coordinating the International Decade for Action ‚ÄòWater for Life‚Äô, 2005-2015.

Accompanied by singing, it provides spectacular variety and complexity of skills. Woven around the presiding deity of Beereshwara or Beeralingeswara, chiefly worshipped by the Kuruba Gowdas of Karnataka and also called Halumathasthas, it presents both entertainment and spiritual edification.  Background  In all temples of Beereshwara the major instrument Dollu is hung by means of a thick thread tied to hooks in the ceiling. Every time worship is offered to Beereshwara, there should be an instantaneous beating of the dollu. This expressive literature its oral tradition goes by the legend called 'Halumatha Purana' or Kuruba Purana. The story is that the demon Dolla-asura worshiped Shiva devotedly and, when Shiva appeared before him, asked him to ask for a boon; that he should be able to swallow Shiva himself, or else he requests immortality which Shiva refuses so that the enraged Dollu swallows Shiva. Shiva started growing big. The asura, unable to bear the pain, pleaded Shiva to come out. Shiva tore open the demon, thus killing him, and came out. Shiva used the skin of the asura to make a dollu/drum and gave it to the rustics, his devotees, the ‚ÄúHalu Kurubas‚Äù. The ‚ÄúHalu Kuruba‚Äù tribes in shimogga follow this tradition even today. The performers form a semi-circle and involve in extremely swift and supple movements. The beat is controlled and directed by a leader with cymbals who is positioned in the centre. Slow and fast rhythms alternate and group Share: weaves varied patterns. The costumes are simple. Upper part of the body is usually left bare while a black sheet-rug is tied on the lower body over the \`dhooti\` or sarong. Dollu Kunitha performed by women Kuruba Gowdas sing with intonation distinct from other kinds of folk singers, tracing the origin of their genealogy, evolution and development over the ages. Dollu dance has gone on uninterruptedly generation after generation with renewed vigour and raciness of performance. Hardly any religious performance of a ritualistic ceremony or any village festival can ever take place without this dance, especially in North Karnataka. On all these occasions, the Dollu dance becomes the very centre of activity around which other important things get built up. Since this dance demands strength, muscle power and the spirit of endurance, only well-built sturdy persons of enough stamina alone can take to it.

Between 1919 and 1927 Waddington made 255 appearances for Yorkshire, and in all first-class cricket played 266 matches. In these games, he took a total of 852 wickets with his left arm fast-medium bowling. Capable of making the ball swing, Waddington was admired for the aesthetic quality of his bowling action. He was a hostile bowler who sometimes sledged opposing batsmen and questioned umpires' decisions, behaviour which was unusual during his playing days. Waddington first played for Yorkshire after the First World War, when the team had been weakened by injuries and retirements. He made an immediate impression in 1919, his first season; he took 100 wickets and was largely responsible for Yorkshire's victory in the County Championship that year. After a similarly successful season in 1920, he was selected for the 1920‚Äì21 Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) tour of Australia, during which he appeared in two of the five Tests. However, the England team were outclassed; used in an unfamiliar tactical role, Waddington took just one wicket and never played for England again. He continued to be effective for Yorkshire, particularly against the weaker counties, but was often inconsistent. His reputation as an uncompromising opponent was cemented when he was found guilty of dissent and inciting the crowd in a game against Middlesex. A succession of injuries reduced his effectiveness and he retired from first-class cricket in 1927. He continued to play league cricket and worked for the family business, a fat- refining firm, but maintained his connection with Yorkshire cricket. In the early 1920s, Waddington played several football matches for Halifax Town as a goalkeeper, and after his retirement from cricket enjoyed some success as an amateur golfer. He was in trouble with the police on more than one occasion and after the Second World War was charged with defrauding his wartime employers, the Ministry of Food; he was found not guilty. He died in 1959 at the age of 66. Early life Abraham Waddington was born in Clayton, Bradford, on 4 February 1893, the eldest of three brothers. His family owned a fat-refining business managed by his father, Sam. When he left school, Waddington joined the family firm as a lorry driver, occasionally working in the refinery. He began playing cricket for Crossley Hall in the West Bradford League at the age of 11; as a teenager he played in the Bradford League for Lidget Green and then Laisterdyke, gaining a local reputation as a fast-medium bowler. He helped Laisterdyke win the League championship in 1913,Howe, p. 72. before moving to Wakefield for the 1914 season, where he took 98 wickets at an average of 12.00.Woodhouse, p. 303. He played for Yorkshire Second XI in August 1914, alongside future First XI teammates Herbert Sutcliffe and Cec Tyson, but the outbreak of the First World War prevented him making any further appearances for the county. When war was declared, Waddington volunteered for Lord Kitchener's New Army, joining the Bradford Pals battalion of the West Yorkshire Regiment. On 1 July 1916, during the first day of the Battle of the Somme, Waddington was wounded by shrapnel at Serre, and took shelter in a crater in no man's land with other wounded soldiers. One of these was the Yorkshire cricketer Major Booth, who was mortally wounded. Waddington comforted Booth while the cricketer died in his arms, an experience which haunted Waddington for the rest of his life.Howe, p. 73. After recovering, Waddington transferred to the Royal Flying Corps. First-class cricketer =County debut= Yorkshire's bowling attack was severely depleted when cricket resumed in 1919 owing to a combination of retirements and deaths in the war. Additionally, George Hirst was past his best, meaning that Yorkshire needed to recruit new fast bowlers. In May and June, the team struggled to dismiss opposing sides on hard pitches; their results were poor and when two important matches were lost in June, Wisden Cricketers' Almanack suggested that \\"things looked very black\\". At this point in the season the Yorkshire cricketers Roy Kilner and Arthur Dolphin, who like Waddington had also been wounded at the Somme, recommended him to the Yorkshire committee, probably after seeing him take part in cricket matches in the army. Having returned to play for Laisterdyke in the Bradford League, Waddington was called into the Yorkshire side at the beginning of July for the County Championship match against Derbyshire. On his first-class debut, he took four for 26 (four wickets for 26 runs) in 26 overs, and after missing the next match, he followed up with nine wickets against Essex in his second game, taking his first five wicket haul in the second innings of that match. From Waddington's debut, Yorkshire's results improved and the team won the Championship. Wisden judged that Waddington's contribution was crucial: \\"Without him Yorkshire would certainly not have won the Championship\\". He and Wilfred Rhodes formed an effective bowling partnership and, according to Wisden, \\"Rhodes and Waddington, with E. R. Wilson, for a few weeks, and [Emmott] Robinson to help them, carried the eleven from success to success\\". It described Waddington as bowling \\"left-hand, medium pace inclining to fast\\", with a \\"delivery that seems part of himself‚Äîfree from any suggestion of labour or undue effort\\"; it noted that he always bowled a good length and made the ball bounce sharply after pitching. The writer judged Waddington's first season had been one of \\"exceptional promise\\" and predicted that Waddington would go on to \\"great things\\". In the official history of Yorkshire County Cricket Club, Derek Hodgson suggests that Waddington's versatility brought him success, as did the line which he bowled to the batsmen.Hodgson, p. 106. He finished with 100 wickets at an average of 18.74, with eight five-wicket returns. Waddington was only the sixth bowler in first-class cricket history to reach 100 wickets in his debut year. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the Championship in 1920; most of the bowling responsibility fell once more on Waddington and Rhodes, and the other bowlers provided little support. Despite a good start to the season, the team faded in the latter part of the year.Hodgson, p. 107. Wisden suggested that \\"in the circumstances [Rhodes and Waddington] did wonders, Waddington having some irresistible days against the weaker counties.\\" He took 141 wickets in the season at an average of 16.79. His best figures came in the two matches against Northamptonshire: in the first game he took 11 wickets, and in the second took 13 wickets for 48 runs, including seven for 18 in the first innings, and a hat-trick. Waddington's season concluded with his selection for the professional \\"Players\\" teams in the prestigious Gentlemen v Players match at the Scarborough Festival. He was one of four players from Yorkshire chosen to tour Australia that winter with the MCC.Woodhouse, p. 310. Hodgson suggests that he was chosen as \\"the discovery of the first post-war period\\". =Test selection and leading bowler= alt=Two cricketers on a field The 1920‚Äì21 MCC tour to Australia was unsuccessful for the tourists. Captained by J. W. H. T. Douglas, the team was overwhelmed by Australia, losing all five Test matches. Wisden stated that the \\"chief cause of failure was the bowling\\". The MCC had been reluctant to tour so soon after the war, and critics had predicted the bowling would be weak in Australian conditions, where the pitches were generally hard and good for batting. At the beginning of November, before the first-class matches began, Waddington was operated on for abscesses, and missed the first five games. He played only one first-class match before the first Test, but took wickets in several minor matches. Selected for the first Test, he took the first wicket to fall in the game, that of Charlie Macartney, but failed to take another wicket in the match while conceding 88 runs, hampered by a leg injury in the later stages. He did not play another Test until the fourth, where he bowled five overs for 31 runs. Waddington ended the tour with seven wickets at an average of 46.71; his single Test wicket was at a cost of 119 runs. The tour was a frustrating experience for Waddington, who found the heat difficult to deal with; he was also unhappy that most of his appearances came in the non-first-class country matches, many against opponents fielding more than eleven players to make a more even fight. Throughout the tour, the press criticised Douglas for the way he used bowlers. Although Yorkshire used Waddington in short bursts with the objective of taking wickets, Douglas used him to bowl long defensive spells with the prime objective of run-saving, a task to which Waddington was unsuited.Howe, p. 74. Considered a failure‚ÄîWisden later described his tour as \\"a sad disappointment\\"‚ÄîWaddington did not play for England again and was never seriously considered for a recall. He did have one batting success on the tour, scoring his maiden first-class fifty against an \\"Australian XI\\". In the 1921 season, Waddington took 105 wickets at an average of 18.94. The introduction of the pace bowler George Macaulay into the team gave him more support, but according to a later edition of Wisden, Waddington's form was poor that year. The almanack's review of the 1921 season suggested that, when at full strength, Yorkshire had the best bowling attack in the championship, but the team finished third. Both Waddington and Yorkshire were more successful the following year: the county won the first of four successive championships, and Waddington took 133 wickets at an average of 16.08. He was often effective in the most important matches. Wisden suggested that \\"Yorkshire were very good at every point, but their main strength lay in the excellence and variety of their bowling ... [Waddington] was, on occasions, more successful against strong sides than he had ever been before. He had days of astonishing success and once, at least, bowled with a bewildering swerve [i. e. swing bowling] that recalled George Hirst at his best.\\" Among his best performances were figures of eight for 34 against Northamptonshire (the best of his career), seven wickets for six runs in a Sussex total of 20 and eight for 35 against Hampshire. His season ended with festival games at Eastbourne, where he represented the North against the South and played for a team of ex- Royal Air Force servicemen. =Injury and controversy= Waddington was less effective in 1923, and despite a good bowling average, he was inconsistent. In July, he slipped on wet grass when he was about to bowl against Leicestershire at Fartown Ground, Huddersfield; the subsequent shoulder injury effectively ended his season, apart from one match against Lancashire in which he bowled just six overs. In September, the injury required an operation to repair a torn ligament. The injury affected the remainder of his career and his bowling was never as effective.Howe, p. 76. In total, before his injury, he took 65 wickets at 18.23 in 1923. That season, he recorded his best figures with the bat; after never having a first-class batting average better than 12 in an English season, he scored 317 runs at 24.38, including his first fifty in England. On his return in 1924, Waddington bowled little in his first matches, but was used more in Yorkshire's defeat by Middlesex at Lord's where he bowled 42 overs to take three for 116. Several Yorkshire players were absent, playing representative matches, but the game had consequences later in the season.Woodhouse, p. 327.Howe, p. 75. In the return match at Sheffield in July, the Yorkshire players seemed determined to have revenge but could only secure a draw. Critics thought that the Yorkshire bowlers appealed excessively to the umpires, and the Middlesex players were barracked by the crowd. The journalist Alfred Pullin described the match as \\"a sorry exhibition of ill feeling and bad manners.\\" The umpires reported Waddington to the cricket committee of the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and gestures of displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him to write a letter of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned at the end of the season,Woodhouse, p. 332. and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match.Marshall, p. 16. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.Woodhouse, p. 333 =Decline= Waddington took more than 100 wickets in a season for the final time in 1925. Although his form was mixed, he achieved some good performances.Woodhouse, p. 338. Wisden attributed Yorkshire's championship victory to their bowlers and suggested that \\"Waddington enjoyed a well-merited success\\". In total, he took 109 wickets at an average of 20.24. In 1926 both he and the other bowlers were less successful as Yorkshire slipped to second. Wisden noticed a decline in his bowling, but expected him to recover his form. He took 78 wickets at an average of 23.30, and scored his highest aggregate with the bat in a season, making 525 runs with two fifties. In the English winter of 1926‚Äì27, he travelled to India and worked as a cricket coach. Waddington's bowling declined further in 1927, to the point where Wisden suggested his record was poor and his \\"work was only occasionally worthy of his reputation\\". The effectiveness of the other bowlers was similarly reduced, and combined with a cautious, safety-first approach, Yorkshire had a mixed season and finished third.Hodgson, pp. 119‚Äì20. Waddington took 45 wickets at 32.02, and conceded a high number of runs on many occasions.Woodhouse, p. 345. However, in what was his last season, he scored his only first-class century, an innings of 114 against Worcestershire. His final first-class appearance was for the North against the South at the Folkestone Festival, where he bowled 16 overs without taking a wicket. At the end of the season, Waddington was offered a new contract despite his decline in bowling and continuing problems from his injured shoulder. He turned it down, ending his county cricket career. In all first-class matches, Waddington took 852 wickets at an average of 19.75 and scored 2,527 runs at an average of 12.89 with four fifties as well as the century. The following season, Yorkshire awarded him a testimonial of ¬£1,000. Style and personality Waddington bowled with control, maintaining a good length while his action made the ball swing away from the batsman. For variation, he delivered an off-cutter and when he bowled, the ball seemed to increase its speed after bouncing.Cardus, p. 31. He often bowled around the wicket. His curved run-up began from the on side of the wicket, and he ran behind the umpire. He then released the ball from the corner of the bowling crease, creating a sharp angle for the batsman to face, sometimes using short deliveries with a ring of leg side fielders.Cardus, p. 73. Waddington modelled his bowling on that of George Hirst, a fellow left-arm paceman who also acted as a coach and mentor to him in his early career, but Derek Hodgson notes that the two men were very different in personality: Waddington was far more quick- tempered than Hirst. Waddington's bowling action was noted for its excellence and perfection. Neville Cardus, the journalist and cricket writer, described it as \\"gloriously rhythmical\\",Cardus, p. 54. and \\"so lovely that one simply cannot deny he is a good bowler.\\" But too often, Cardus suggested, he was \\"ever raising hopes that real greatness will come from him, only to disappoint again and again\\". Although Waddington scored a first-class century in his final season, he did not live up to his batting potential despite a good style. A lower-order batsman,Marshall, p. 38. he was inclined to be dismissed through playing irresponsible shots. Herbert Sutcliffe believed that, had he not been a bowler, Waddington may have developed into a leading batsman; he wrote that Waddington \\"had as delightful a batting style as he had a bowling style.\\"Sutcliffe, p. 138. But Sutcliffe suggested that Waddington did not possess the required patience: \\"He used to hit up a brilliant 30 or 40 before making a perfectly silly shot\\". Waddington resented the class divisions in English cricket, his feelings fuelled by experiences of officers in the war and possibly his tour to Australia in 1920‚Äì21. He fully embraced Yorkshire's hard-edged competitiveness in the early 1920s: he questioned the decisions of umpires and sledged opposing batsmen, both of which were unusual at the time. His Times obituary noted that some disagreements came because Waddington played to win and was an enthusiastic appealer, although he was unlikely to win many appeals for leg before wicket because of the angle at which he bowled. Anthony Woodhouse, the cricket historian, describes Waddington as a \\"wild and irresponsible ... quick-tempered individual\\". But there was another side to his personality; he was a good talker and liked to wear smart clothes, including monogrammed silk shirts. Sutcliffe, a close friend and teammate of Waddington,Howe, pp. 72, 76. called him \\"a genial fellow in the dressing room; a man with a rare personality, proof of which is shown by the fact that whenever there was a discussion of any kind in the dressing room, Abe generally ruled it, to all intents and purposes, the chairman.\\"Sutcliffe, p. 137. The cricket writer Jim Kilburn wrote that \\"at his best, [Waddington] was a magnificently hostile bowler with one of the most beautiful actions ever seen in cricket, and his pace and break-back were a problem for the greatest of batsmen\\".Howe, p. 77. The historian Leslie Duckworth summed him up: \\"Yes, a man of temper, Waddington, but a fine cricketer.\\" Later life When Waddington retired from first-class cricket, he took over the family business. He played as a professional for West Bromwich Dartmouth CC in the Birmingham League in 1928, and for Accrington in 1929 and 1930. He maintained friendships with several members of the Yorkshire team and was a pallbearer at Kilner's funeral in 1928. In 1954‚Äì55, the Yorkshire player and England captain Len Hutton invited Waddington to accompany the members of the MCC team to Australia. En route by sea, the team visited the grave of Hedley Verity, the Yorkshire bowler who was killed in Italy in the Second World War and buried there. Including his visit as a player, Waddington made five trips to Australia. Waddington had success in other sports, especially as an amateur football goalkeeper. He was with Bradford City in the 1920‚Äì21 football season, but did not play a match for them. For the 1921‚Äì22 season, he played for Halifax Town, making seven appearances in the Football League. He was a good enough golfer to represent Yorkshire, to partner Henry Cotton, and to play in the qualifying rounds of the Open Championship in 1935 and 1939. Sutcliffe wrote that leading golfers told him that had Waddington not been a cricketer, he had the talent to have succeeded as a golfer, although he was prone to carelessness in his play. One Bradford golf club banned him after he poured a glass of beer over the captain, who Waddington believed had used inappropriate language in front of a woman. A motorcycling enthusiast, he regularly attended the Isle of Man TT, although his love of fast cars brought him trouble from the police at times. After one incident in 1938, he was fined ¬£5 for assaulting a policeman and using obscene language after being asked to dip his headlights. In 1950, he was fined and banned from driving for a year after being found drunk while attempting to start up his car. In mitigation, his lawyer claimed he was suffering from \\"overwork, worry and insomnia.\\" At the start of the Second World War, Waddington was appointed chairman of the North Eastern Division Advisory Committee for the Control of Oils and Fats and became an agent of the Ministry of Food. His responsibilities included arranging for the storage of fats. When the war concluded, he was charged with conspiracy to defraud the Ministry of Food when it was discovered that a letter detailing amounts of money had been altered. The prosecution alleged that between 1943 and 1944, Waddington and the manager of another fat storage firm shared ¬£1,600 between them which should have gone to the latter's company when the price paid by the Ministry for storage increased. Waddington denied all knowledge; his brother Priestley, another director at the family firm, said that he made the arrangements to pay a portion of the increased fees to Waddington's co-defendant without the knowledge of Waddington. Waddington was acquitted when a judge ruled that there was no way that it could be proven that he had known of the alteration to the letter, or that he was in any way responsible. Waddington was married twice. In 1925, he married Mabel Fawell; none of his Yorkshire teammates were aware that he was getting married. In 1952, he married Doris Garforth; on this occasion, many of his former cricketing colleagues attended. After a long illness, Waddington died in a Scarborough nursing home on 28 October 1959 aged 66. He was cremated in Bradford.Woodhouse, p. 304.

He has acted on various Argentine films and television series for five decades. Career Alberto Fernandez de Rosa began acting when he was a child. He debuted in theater at the age of eleven, participating at plays on the Teatro Liceo, under the supervision of playwright Luisa Vehil. While not a prominent actor at first, he struggled until he was finally able to land a job in the television series, 1962's La Familia Falcon (The Falcon Family). At the age of eighteen, de Rosa became a teen idol in Argentina. Next, he made his first movie, El Secreto de Monica\\" (Monica's Secret). This film proved important in Fernandez de Rosa's acting career, as it exposed him for the first time to Spain's public. He ended that year by participating in El Televisor. In 1963, de Rosa came back to La Familia Falcon, this time, playing the character of Alberto. In 1965, he played Bobby in the comedy film Pajarito G√≥mez. He followed that work with El Castigador (The Punisher), and 1966's Buenos Aires, Summer 1912 (Buenos Aires in the Summer of 1912), which was a look back at Argentina's capital city during the 1910s. The 22-year-old actor made four films in 1966. Apart from Buenos Aires, Summer 1912, another major movie he made that year was El Bikini Rojo (Red Bikini), which enjoyed success in West Germany as well as in Argentina. After taking a rest from filming in 1967, de Rosa returned to the screens in 1968, participating in the Italian- Spaniard production Il marchio di Kriminal. He had by then moved to Spain. De Rosa lived in Spain for three years, during which he made a total of seventeen films. After returning to Argentina in 1971, de Rosa participated in his first television series, playing Ruben in Ni√±o, las Cosas Simples de la Vida (Boy, Simpler Things in Life). By then, he shifted from being a teen idol to becoming a critically respected actor, both in Argentina and in Spain. After one more movie, de Rosa participated in La Ultima Se√±ora Anderson, a movie that was shown in the United States as Death at the Deep End of the Swimming Pool. La Ultima Se√±ora Anderson was also shown in movie theaters in Italy. In some United States markets, the movie was given the title The Fourth Victim. In 1972, he participated in Destino de un Capricho (A Wish's Destiny), then returned to Spain the next year to film the comedy Don Quijote cabalga de nuevo (Don Quijote Rides Again). De Rosa began 1973 by making another movie, then established himself in West Germany for a small period, having been contracted by an important television network to participate in a sitcom. He acted in 26 episodes of a series named Kara Ben Nemsi Effendi. After that, he returned to Spain, where he made Manolo, la Nuit (Manolo by Night) and two other films before that year was over. In 1974, de Rosa participated in what was arguably his most successful film: El Insolito Embarazo de los Martinez (The Martinez Family's Strange Pregnancy), a comedy movie about a man who became impregnated by his wife. The film was successful both in Spain and Latin America and later on became the inspiration for the Hollywood movie, Junior. In 1974, de Rosa made seven more movies, including Yo la vi Primero, El Reprimido, and Los Nuevos Espa√±oles, which were released in English as I Saw Her First, The Repressed Man, and The New Spaniards, respectively. In 1975, de Rosa acted in the international hit, El Poder del Deseo (Power of Desire). The film gave de Rosa international exposure, as it was shown in many Hispanic and English-speaking countries. The next year, de Rosa participated in Los Casados y la Menor (The Married Couple and the Minor), Mi Mujer es muy Decente, Dentro de lo que Cabe (My Wife is Decent, Depending on what Decent Is), La Guerra del Cerdo (Diary of a Pig War), and in an episode of a television series named Las Sorpresas (Surprises). In 1976, de Rosa was casted in the horror-comedy film Tiempos Duros Para Dracula\\" (Hard Tomes for Dracula). He also partook roles in Retrato de Familia (Family Portrait), La Mujer es Cosa de Hombres (Women are for Men), Juan que re√≠a (Juan, the Man That Laughed), and Las Camareras (Female Flight Attendants). In 1977, de Rosa played Manene in El Monosabio (The Wise Monkey). He was also casted in Caperucita y Roja (She wears a hood and her face is reddened), which was a spoof off the Little Red Riding Hood children's story, plus Estoy Hecho un Chaval (I feel like a Kid Again) and Caledonio y yo Somos Asi (Caledonio and I are Like That). In 1978, de Rosa participated in El Juego del Diablo (Devil's Game), after which he decided to take a voluntary retirement from Argentine screens. He had already, however, become an iconic figure among Argentine actors. When he returned to screen acting in 1981, he acted in Buscando a Perico (Searching for Perico). He also acted in Rocky Carambola, which was an international hit. Rocky Carambola was released in Mexico as Criada se Enamora: La Rocky Carambola (Maid Falls in Love: Rocky Carambola); other countries knew this film as Le Agarro la Mano el Chango (The Monkey Grabbed its Hand). Next for him was Italian release Por Favore, Ocupatti de Amelia (Please, Take Care of Amelia), which was released in Spain as Por Favor, Ocupate de Amelia. 1982 began for de Rosa with another movie Corazon de Papel. Then, he played Alberto Fernandez in La Colmena, which was released in English, as The Beehive. De Rosa returned to Spain on 1983, where he worked on a children's film, Parchis Entra en Accion (Parchis Goes to Action). He then returned to Argentina after that. Back at home, he participated in his first telenovela, Mesa de Noticias (News Table), where he acted as Rosales. He followed that up acting as Eduardo in El Ultimo Kamikaze (The Last Kamikaze), then he acted in Mi Amigo el Vagabundo (My Friend the Homeless), finishing his 1984 screen acting schedule with Dos Mejor que Uno (Two are Better Than One). De Rosa acted in only one film during 1985, Flores Robadas de los Jardines de Quilmes (Flowers stolen from Quilmes' Gardens), but he came back in 1986 to participate in five films, namely Brigada explosiva (Explosive Brigade), once again, playing Rosales. The film is a sequel of Brigada explosiva contra los ninjas, or Explosive Brigade versus Ninjas, Dragon Rapide, where he played General Ordaz, Los Amores de Laurita (Laurita's Loves) and Los Insomnes (Insomniacs). De Rosa made two films in 1987, Los Ba√±eros m√°s locos del mundo (The Craziest Beach Goers in the World), Los Matamonstruos en la mansion del terror (The Monster Killers at the Horror Mansion). Then, he began 1988 with Los Pilotos mas locos del mundo (The Craziest Pilots in the World, a sequel to Los Ba√±eros m√°s locos del mundo), which was followed by Soldadito Espa√±ol (Little Spaniard Soldier), a comedy movie that was directed by Antonio Gimen√®z Rico). He finished off 1988 with a small role in Baton Rouge which starred Victoria Abril and Antonio Banderas in one of Banderas' earlier works and where Fernandez de Rosa actually had a job as an extra, playing a card player. In 1989, Fernandez de Rosa returned to Buenos Aires. This would prove to be an important career move for Fernandez de Rosa later on. In Buenos Aires, he became a theater director in the well known Teatro San Martin. Meanwhile, he acted in a television show named DNI: La Otra Historia (DNI: The Other Story). During 1990, Fernandez de Rosa acted on television only once. He was elected as subsecretary of culture in Buenos Aires, and he returned to screen acting with his participation in \\"Atame!\\", which was televised in the United States as \\"Tie me Up, Tie me Down!\\". Next came one of the most important acting jobs in Fernandez de Rosa's career: His character in Grande Pa!, Teo, became very popular in Argentina. In Grande Pa! (titled Super Dad in English speaking countries that televised the show), de Rosa had his first chance of acting alongside Agustina Cherri, who would later on act with Fernandez de Rosa in \\"Chiquititas\\". During the early 1990s, Fernandez de Rosa became casting director at Telefe, a job he held in high esteem; he saw his being chosen as casting director at Telefe as a form of respect towards his career as an actor by that company's executive directors. Fernandez de Rosa made one more series in 1991, \\"Fuera de Juego\\" (\\"Offsides\\"). In 1992, he acted in a Spaniard comedy, \\"Sevilla Connection\\". He also participated in \\"Una Mujer Bajo la Lluvia' (\\"Woman in the Rain\\") as \\"Javier\\", and in Aqui, el que no Corre...Vuela (Here, He Who Won't Run...Will Fly). De Rosa began 1993 by playing Cairo in Tretas de Mujer (A Woman's Threats). But after Tretas de Mujer, de Rosa was approached by Telefe to begin searching for teenaged actors to be cast in his next show, Chiquititas. He spent 1994 helping Cris Morena prepare the show that would become a megahit internationally. Chiquititas \\"Chiquititas\\" began to be produced by Telefe, and shown across Argentina and various countries in Latin America, Europe and Asia in 1995 . Fernandez de Rosa acted along with the performers he cast for the children's telenovela, including Maria Jimena Piccolo, Facundo Arana, Romina Yan (Morena's daughter) and, as aforementioned, Agustina Cherri. He played \\"Saverio\\", a cook who had immigrated from Spain. The fact that Fernandez de Rosa had lived for many years in Spain helped him play \\"Saverio\\", who had a Spaniard accent. Playing \\"Saverio\\" enabled Fernandez de Rosa to become known among Argentina's younger generations during the 1990s. \\"Chiquititas\\" albums and magazines followed; although Fernandez de Rosa mainly did not participate in these products, he would occasionally be featured on the magazine. When \\"Chiquititas\\" began to be shown in the United States on Telefe's satellite network during the 2000s (decade), Fernandez de Rosa started to become famous among Hispanics in that country as well. After Chiquititas Fernandez de Rosa slowed down his work as a screen actor considerably after \\"Chiquititas\\", concentrating more on his job as casting director for Telefe. In 1996, he played \\"Augustus Rios\\" in \\"Palace\\". Contrary to previous years, however, Fernandez de Rosa acted in only one new production during 1996. Already a veteran actor, Fernandez de Rosa once again participated in only one new production in 1997, \\"24 Horas (Algo Esta por Explotar)\\" (\\"24 Hours, Something's About to Explode\\") a drama-comedy starring Julieta Ortega and Eduardo Cutuli. In \\"24 Horas (Algo Esta por Explotar)\\", Fernandez de Rosa also had the opportunity to act alongside well known actress Divina Gloria. Fernandez de Rosa took 1998 off, then returned to Argentine television in the 1999 soap opera, \\"La Mujer del Presidente\\" (\\"The President's Wife\\"). After being away for one more year, Fernandez de Rosa joined Guillermo Francella in 2001 during some episodes of Francella's hit series \\"Pone a Francella\\" (\\"Put on Francella\\"). 2001 has so far proven to be the last year in which Fernandez de Rosa did screen acting, with his last appearance in a film named \\"Te Besare Ma√±ana\\" (\\"I Will Kiss you Tomorrow\\"). As of 2006, Fernandez de Rosa continued working as casting director for Telefe.

It was released on 20 February 1995 by 4th & B'way Records. In the years leading up to the album, Tricky had grown frustrated with his limited role in the musical group Massive Attack and wanted to pursue an independent project. Shortly after, he discovered vocalist Martina Topley-Bird ‚Äì who he felt would offer another dimension to his lyrics ‚Äì and signed a solo contract with 4th & B'way Records in 1993. Tricky recorded Maxinquaye the following year, primarily at his home studio in London, and Topley-Bird served as the album's main vocalist, with Alison Goldfrapp, Ragga and Mark Stewart performing additional vocals. Tricky produced the album alongside Mark Saunders, who helped him use dub production techniques and heavily altered samples taken from a variety of sources. The record's groove-oriented and low-tempo sound incorporates elements from hip hop, soul, rock, ambient techno, reggae and experimental music. Tricky's lyrics explore themes of cultural decline, dysfunctional sexual relationships, fear of intimacy and recreational drug use, as he drew on his experiences in British drug culture and the influence of his late mother Maxine Quaye, after whom the album is titled. Maxinquaye reached the number three position on the United Kingdom's albums chart and sold over 100,000 copies in its first few months of release. 4th & B'way marketed the album by relying on independent record promoters and Tricky's appearances in media, including publicity photographs and music videos that portrayed him and Topley-Bird in gender-bending fashion. Maxinquaye was cited by many journalists as the year's best record and the key release of the burgeoning trip hop genre. Since then, it has sold more than 500,000 copies worldwide and ranks frequently on lists of the greatest albums, while regarded as a significant influence on electronica, underground hip hop and British hip hop.  Background  Tricky, photographed in 2008 After a troubled upbringing in the Knowle West neighbourhood of Bristol, Tricky became involved with an eclectic collective of DJs and musicians known as The Wild Bunch during the late 1980s.; . As part of the collective, he helped arrange sound systems around Bristol's club scene and performed raps under a stage name derived from \\"Tricky Kid\\", the nickname given to him in a street gang as a youth.; . The Wild Bunch signed a record deal with 4th & B'way Records and released two singles, but their slow, experimental sound failed to make a commercial impact. The collective dissolved in 1989, which led to a few of its members forming the group Massive Attack, with Tricky a frequent collaborator who rapped over their productions; he later reworked material he had written for Massive Attack on Maxinquaye.; . Tricky eventually grew frustrated with his role in Massive Attack, finding it limiting, and wanted to record an album with a female vocalist whose singing would offer another dimension to his lyrics and their meaning. In 1993, he discovered Martina Topley-Bird, then a teenager at Clifton College, when he saw her sitting against a wall near his house, singing to herself. \\"That's really how it happened\\", she recalled. \\"A few weeks later, I went around to his house with some friends. We'd been drinking cider after our GCSEs. We were banging on his door, but he wasn't in. Then Mark Stewart, who lived there, came up to us and said: 'Yeah, this is Tricky's house, jump in through the window.'\\" Tricky, whose lyrics had matured from raps about street violence and sex to more personal and introspective writing, said Topley-Bird found his songs \\"quite depressing\\", which he believed was because of her more privileged background: \\"It's just reality. She's been a student all her life, grew up in Somerset, and I don't think she's ever faced the real world. She finds it all a bit weird. But she's my best mate.\\" They formed a musical and romantic partnership over subsequent years, and their first recording together ‚Äì \\"Aftermath\\" ‚Äì later appeared on Maxinquaye. After offering the song to Massive Attack, who were not interested in including it on their 1991 album Blue Lines, Tricky released \\"Aftermath\\" independently to local record stores in September 1993 before he signed a record deal with 4th & B'way.; .  Recording and production  Tricky asked Mark Saunders to co-produce Maxinquaye after being impressed by his previous work with the rock band The Cure on their albums Mixed Up (1990) and Wish (1992). They recorded Maxinquaye in the first half of 1994 at Tricky's home studio in Kilburn; further recording later took place at the Loveshack and Eastcote studios in Notting Hill. Island Records, 4th & B'Way's parent label, set up equipment in the home studio at Tricky's request, including an Akai S1000 sampler, an Atari 1040 computer with Logic software, an Alesis ADAT recorder, an AKG C3000 microphone, a Behringer Composer compressor and a Mackie 1604 mixing desk. An Akai S1000 sampler, among the equipment used for the album The recording sessions were somewhat chaotic, and Saunders, who had the impression he would only perform engineering duties, often found himself serving as a DJ and programmer. Tricky instructed him on what to sample, regardless of different tempos and pitches, and asked him to piece the results together, something Saunders achieved by pitch-shifting the respective samples until the combination sounded satisfactory.; . The samples they experimented with were taken from the many vinyl records that Saunders recalled were \\"littered\\" all over Tricky's floor. Influenced by dub music's production techniques, Tricky exhaustively altered borrowed sounds on his sampler, mixed tracks as they were being recorded live in the studio, and preserved sounds that otherwise would have been unwanted in the final mix, including glitches and crackles. Tricky had no concept of pitch and no regard for notational conventions or time signatures, nor any previous experience with sampling. Consequently, his approach to Maxinquaye challenged Saunders to rethink his ideas about music production and experiment in ways he had never tried before. Saunders was asked to combine samples of two songs that were 30 beats per minute apart and composed in entirely different keys. \\"[Tricky] thought differently to anybody I've ever known\\", he recalled. \\"It didn't occur to me that by de-tuning one to slow it down, both might then gel musically at that point. I always think of it like going into a scrapyard and building a car out of all the bits you can find. You could probably build a car that would work, and although it might be the ugliest you've ever seen, it would have loads of character.\\" Martina Topley-Bird (2010) According to the American critic Robert Christgau, Maxinquayes groove-oriented and low-tempo music drew not only on dub but also on lo-fi, ambient techno and hip hop, while James Hunter from Rolling Stone said Tricky subsumed American hip hop, soul, reggae and 1980s English rock sounds into \\"a mercurial style of dance music\\".; . Entertainment Weeklys resident critic David Browne classified the music as an intellectual form of R&B.; Ben Walsh of The Independent called it an experimental album featuring a \\"heady blend\\" of soul, rock, punk, hip hop, dub and electronica. In Tricky's own words, he composed his songs based on a particular sound he liked rather than having a definite song structure in mind: \\"I couldn't write you a blues track or a hip-hop track if you asked. I just make what I hear and then me and Martina sing all the words on paper, putting the emphasis on the things that perhaps shouldn't be sung.\\" Almost all of Topley-Bird's vocals on Maxinquaye were recorded in a single take, a process she later said was \\"totally instinctive. There was no time to drum up an alter ego.\\" Topley-Bird, a soft-spoken singer, found herself backed on most tracks by Tricky's rapped vocals. According to the journalist Sean O'Hagan, she sang with a \\"broken voice\\" that acted as \\"the perfect foil to Tricky's whispered and drawled raps\\". The liner notes credited Tricky and Topley-Bird for vocals on all songs except \\"Pumpkin\\" and \\"You Don't\\", which Tricky performed with Alison Goldfrapp and Ragga, respectively. A printing error mistakenly credited the then-unknown Topley-Bird as \\"Martine\\" on the record. Other musicians were recruited to play instruments for some tracks, including James Stevenson on guitar and Pete Briquette on bass. The band FTV performed on \\"Black Steel\\", which was a rock version of Public Enemy's \\"Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos\\" (1988) and one of two remakes on Maxinquaye; Tricky also remade one of his contributions for Massive Attack, \\"Karmacoma\\" (1994), retitling it as \\"Overcome\\".; . Saunders contributed guitar himself, with the resulting improvisations treated as samples.  Themes  Much of the thematic content on Maxinquaye is informed by Tricky's late mother. He explained the title's connection to his mother in an interview with Simon Reynolds: \\"Quaye, that's this race of people in Africa, and 'Maxin,' that's my mum's name, Maxine, and I've just taken the E off\\"; Reynolds interpreted this as a \\"place name\\" similar to the Rastafarian idea of Zion. In another source, Tricky was reported as saying Quaye had also been his mother's surname. According to Greg Kot, his mother's name provided the album its title while her suicide, along with his father abandoning him and Tricky's lack of moral sense as a youth, helped inform his \\"unsentimental grasp on reality\\", which was reflected in Maxinquayes \\"collision of beauty and violence\\". In the opinion of Stylus Magazines Kenan Hebert, who called it \\"a document of obsession, mistrust, misconduct, solipsism and sociopathy\\", the songs dealing with dysfunctional sexual relationships and fear of intimacy were given a Freudian angle by his mother's influence on the album, including Tricky's reference to her on \\"Aftermath\\". In an interview for The Wire, Tricky explained his mother's influence and his use of female vocalists like Topley- Bird: \\"My first lyric ever on a song was 'your eyes resemble mine, you'll see as no others can'. I didn't have any kids then ... so what am I talking about? Who am I talking about? My mother ... used to write poetry but in her time she couldn't have done anything with that, there wasn't any opportunity. It's almost like she killed herself to give me the opportunity, my lyrics. I can never understand why I write as a female, I think I've got my mum's talent, I'm her vehicle. So I need a woman to sing that.\\" While songs such as \\"Overcome\\" and \\"Suffocated Love\\" dealt with themes of \\"sexual paranoia and male dread of intimacy\\", the rest of Maxinquaye explored the psychological tolls of the British recreational drug culture, which Reynolds said served as a \\"temporary utopia\\" for a generation of users who otherwise lacked a \\"constructive outlet for its idealism\\". He felt the album's cover art, featuring rusting metal surfaces, represented the cultural decline explored in the music's themes. Tricky drew on Rastafarian ideas about end time for the record, although unlike adherents to that movement he did not disassociate himself from \\"Babylon\\", or the degenerate qualities of Western society, writing lyrics such as \\"my brain thinks bomb-like/beware of our appetite\\" on \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\". He later told Reynolds, \\"I'm part of this fuckin' psychic pollution ... It's like, I can be as greedy as you. The conditioned part of me says 'yeah, I'm gonna go out and make money, I'm going to rule my own little kingdom.'\\" Christgau deemed the album's songs \\"audioramas of someone who's signed on to work for the wages of sin and lived to cash the check\\", while O'Hagan said Tricky's \\"impressionistic prose poems\\" were written from the deviant perspective of the urban hedonist: \\"Maxinquaye is the sound of blunted Britain, paranoid and obsessive ... This was the inner-city blues, Bristol style\\".; . The songs \\"Ponderosa\\", \\"Strugglin'\\" and \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\" were inspired by Tricky's experiences with marijuana, alcohol, cocaine and ecstasy, particularly a two-year binge and consequent state of despondency while on Massive Attack's payroll after the completion of Blue Lines. His stream-of-consciousness lyrics on Maxinquaye explore the delirious, despondent and emotionally unstable state associated with drug use while offering a pessimistic view of the drug culture, as Tricky viewed the high of cocaine undeserved and the depth of thought achieved through ecstasy unsubstantial.; . In Reynolds' opinion, Tricky's experiences with drug-induced paranoia, anxiety and visions of spectres and demons were represented in the production of songs such as \\"Aftermath\\" and \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\". For the latter track, he altered and slowed down a vocal sample to give it a wounded basso profondo sound, while channelling it through a loop of an orchestral Isaac Hayes recording, \\"Ike's Rap II\\".; . On \\"Strugglin'\\", which sampled sounds of a creaking door and the click of a gun being loaded, Tricky's lyrics made explicit reference to his visions of \\"mystical shadows, fraught with no meaning\\".  Marketing and sales  After Tricky signed to 4th & B'way, the label reissued \\"Aftermath\\" in January 1994 and released \\"Ponderosa\\" in April to promote Maxinquaye.; . The following year, three more singles were released‚Äî\\"Overcome\\" in January, \\"Black Steel\\" in March and \\"Pumpkin\\" in November. The label also released a four-track EP entitled The Hell E.P. in July, which was a collaboration with the American rap group Gravediggaz and featured \\"Hell Is Round the Corner\\"; the song reached number 12 on the British singles chart. 4th & B'way relied on independent record promoters and Tricky's cover story in NME to promote Maxinquaye, even though hip hop records in the United Kingdom generally received exposure through dance music dealers and press. According to 4th & B'way's director Julian Palmer, the UK's demographic of young music buyers such as students was more progressive than in the United States, where he said the record would have to be marketed differently because of his race. He believed that much like Portishead, a contemporary Bristol act, Tricky would have received airplay in the US on alternative or college rock radio if the label focused their efforts to promote him there: \\"Some people I've met were confused because he's black, and it's not easy to break through those barriers there.\\" According to Rupert Howe from Q, the album's music tested stylistic barriers and \\"sounded as alien to hip hop\\" as it did to the Britpop sound popular in the UK at the time. Tricky toured the United States as a supporting act for PJ Harvey (1998). Publicity photos and music videos promoting Maxinquaye featured Tricky and Topley-Bird utilising androgynous imagery. They were photographed on one occasion wearing gender- bending clothing such as a mufti. Other promotional shots based on a wedding concept captured Topley-Bird dressed as the groom. As The Independents Phil Johnson recalled, the very thin Tricky was dressed in drag as the bride and his sickly looking face \\"painted and preened\\", with smeared lipstick and a false eyelash in the style of Alex from the 1971 film A Clockwork Orange. In Johnson's opinion, the record's gender-bending promotional efforts were canny in how they \\"maximized Maxinquayes cross-genre potential\\". According to Reynolds and Joy Press, while \\"most post-rock 'n' roll forms of popular music ideologically rest on rebellions against the feminine\\", Tricky \\"utilized the feminine to construct his rebellion against the strict categories of black identity and music\\". The musician later explained that he simply believed feminine men were much more interesting than masculine men. Maxinquaye was released on 20 February 1995 and sold over 100,000 copies in its first few months in the UK, despite no significant radio airplay. The record charted for 35 weeks on the British albums chart, peaking at number three. After it was released in the US on April 18, Tricky toured the country as a supporting act for the alternative rock singer-songwriter PJ Harvey. According to Nielsen SoundScan, the album had sold 222,000 copies in the US by 2003. By 2012, it had sold over 500,000 copies worldwide. That same year, Tricky performed the entire album with Topley-Bird on April 27 at the Sundance London festival, which was their first onstage appearance together in 15 years.  Critical reception and legacy  Maxinquaye received widespread acclaim from contemporary critics. Reviewing in March 1995 for Mojo, Jon Savage called it a very ambitious and musically audacious work that brilliantly explored the disparities in Britain's social structure, with Topley-Bird as the \\"dominant voice\\" articulating Tricky's vision of uncertainty in an ever-changing world. Dele Fadele from NME said the record was unprecedented, spellbinding and revealed something new with every listen. He found Tricky's production innovative and his fusion of various sounds so seamless, \\"you can't label the results under any existing genre\\". David Bennun of Melody Maker deemed the album almost perfect and Tricky's music highly \\"gripping, original, sublime, his lyrics so abstruse and woven into the sound, that they become inseparable\\". Maxinquayes combination of \\"dreamlike ambient music and hip-hop bite\\" was praised by the Los Angeles Times critic Robert Hilburn for giving Tricky's \\"soundscapes about contemporary life such a seductive and provocative edge\\". In Q magazine, Tom Doyle credited Topley-Bird's singing for making Maxinquaye \\"a highly inventive and intoxicating collection\\" while declaring that \\"with this debut, Tricky proves himself to be more challenging and eclectic than his peers\\". At the end of 1995, Maxinquaye was named the year's best record in critics polls conducted by several English publications, including NME, Melody Maker and The Wire.; . It also finished second in the voting for the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics. The record received a nomination for the 1995 Mercury Prize, an annual music award given to the best album from the UK and Ireland, losing out to Portishead's 1994 debut Dummy. Along with Massive Attack's Blue Lines, Maxinquaye was hailed by journalists as the pivotal release in what they were calling \\"trip hop\\" music; Jon Pareles, the chief critic at The New York Times, called it the genre's \\"first album-length masterpiece\\".; . Tricky disliked the term, saying \\"I was supposed to have invented trip hop, and I will fucking deny having anything to do with it\\".; . Writing years later for Stylus Magazine, Hebert argued that \\"there's too much here to be sequestered to any genre, let alone that one ... Calling Tricky 'trip-hop' is a bit like calling Prince 'pop'. It's partially accurate, but the music is so much better than that.\\" In Mojo, Victoria Segal later called Maxinquaye \\"an exotic, erotic alien that nobody (not least its creator) has managed to clone\\". It was also dubbed \\"the British postmodern album of the 90s\\" by Jason Draper of Record Collector and \\"a visionary post- rock statement\\" by The Philadelphia Inquirers Tom Moon, while AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine said it remains \\"a bracing sonic adventure that gains richness and resonance with each listen\\" because of the songs' imaginative structures and exceptional use of \\"noise and experimental music\\".; ; . By the end of the 1990s, Christgau had come to view Maxinquaye as among the decade's most essential albums. In The Village Voice, he wrote that its enduring significance lies in an aesthetic of cool derived from the blues and African-American culture, which valued a self-possessed resolve in the face of oppression: Maxinquaye has frequently appeared on authoritative lists of the greatest albums, including NMEs 2013 list of the 500 greatest albums, which ranked it 202nd best.; . Uncut named it 156th best on a similar list in 2016. It was ranked high in a Q-published poll determining the 100 greatest British albums, Mojos \\"100 Modern Classics\\" and Rolling Stones \\"Essential Recordings of the 90s\\", among other lists. The record was also ranked 66th on Pitchforks list of the 100 best albums from the 1990s, with the site's guest writer Rollie Pemberton crediting the record for helping shape \\"the landscapes of modern electronica and underground hip-hop\\". Slant Magazine named it the 21st greatest electronic album of the 20th century and wrote that along with Blue Lines and Dummy, it was also \\"one of the most influential trip-hop albums of the '90s\\". In 2015, it was placed at number one on Fact magazine's list of the 50 best trip hop albums, with an accompanying essay saying it contains \\"some of the most tortured and original electronic music cut to wax\\" which \\"left an indelible mark on British music, electronic and otherwise\\". It was included in the music reference book 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die; the journalist Alex Rayner wrote in an accompanying chapter that the \\"innovative, thought provoking and intricately arranged\\" album played a significant role in popularising British hip hop and spoken word music in the UK. Based on such listings, Acclaimed Music ranks Maxinquaye as the 153rd most acclaimed album in history.

He is one of just 12 English double internationals. Cricket Makepeace played in four Tests for England in the 1920‚Äì21 Ashes series in Australia. His first-class career with Lancashire lasted from 1906 to 1930. \\"I count Makepeace amongst the immortals of Lancashire and Yorkshire cricket,\\" wrote Neville Cardus.Cardus, Neville: The Roses Matches: 1919‚Äì1939 (Souvenir Press, 1982), p. 18. Dudley Carew described Makepeace as \\"a master against the turning ball on a difficult pitch\\", and continued: > There was little to catch the eye about his batting, but he was the most > pleasing of defensive batsmen, of men whose art rises to the heights under > the challenge of adversity. ... The fireworks, the rockets, and the frenzies > of big hitting are admirable in their way, but cricket would not be the > enchanting game it is were it not for the quiet beauty of the game's less > riotous colours; Clare wrote poetry as well as Shelley, and Makepeace was of > his school.Dudley Carew, To the Wicket, Chapman & Hall, London, 1946, p. > 135. After his retirement from playing, Makepeace spent two decades as county coach. When Albert Chevallier Tayler was preparing his 1906 painting, Kent vs Lancashire at Canterbury, he arranged sittings with the winning Kent team he was commissioned to celebrate. Tayler also intended to do include Makepeace. Makepeace however was unable to attend a sitting, so Tayler compromised by using William Findlay as the batsman. Findlay had not actually played in that particular match, but he was able to travel to Tayler's London studio as he had just been appointed as secretary of Surrey County Cricket Club. Football Makepeace made 336 appearances and scored 23 goals for Everton between 1902 and 1919 and was a member of the team that won the FA Cup in 1906. He made four appearances as a wing half for the England national football team between 1906 and 1912 and also represented the Football League XI. He is an inductee in Everton's Hall of Fame.  Personal life  Makepeace served as a flight sergeant in the Royal Air Force during the First World War.

Meteoroids are 30 micrometers to 1 meter, dust is smaller, and the term \\"micrometeoroid\\" is discouraged (though not micrometeorite). The IMO noted the new definition, but still displays a prior definition on their site. The Meteoritical Society site retains its prior definition, 0.001 cm. \\"0.001 cm in diameter\\" The AMS has posted no rigorous definition. = Composition = Dust is generally chondritic in composition. Its monomers contain mafic silicates, such as olivine and pyroxene. Silicates are rich in high-condensation temperature forsterite and enstatite. As these condense quickly, they tend to form very small particles, not merging droplets. As with chondritic meteoroids, particles contain Fe(Ni) sulfide and GEMS (glass with embedded metal and sulfides) Various amounts of organics (CHON) are present. Though organics are cosmically abundant, and were widely predicted to exist in comets, they are spectrally indistinct in most telescopes. Organics were only confirmed via mass spectrometry during the Halley flybys. Some organics are in the form of PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons). Very small inclusions of presolar grains (PSGs) may be found. Dust and comet origin Microscopic view of comet dust particle The models for the origin of comets are:Science News 149, June 1, 1996, pp. 346‚Äì347. # the interstellar model, # the Solar System model, # primordial rubble piles, # aggregation of planetesimals in the dust disk around the Uranus‚ÄìNeptune region, # cold shells of material swept out by the protostellar wind. Bulk properties of the comet dust such as density as well as the chemical composition can distinguish between the models. For example, the isotopic ratios of comet and of interstellar dust are very similar, indicating a common origin. The 1) interstellar model says that ices formed on dust grains in the dense cloud that preceded the Sun. The mix of ice and dust then aggregated into a comet without appreciable chemical modification. J. Mayo Greenberg first proposed this idea in the 1970s. In the 2) Solar System model, the ices that formed in the interstellar cloud first vaporized as part of the accretion disk of gas and dust around the protosun. The vaporized ices later resolidified and assembled into comets. So the comets in this model would have a different composition than those comets that were made directly from interstellar ice. The 3) primordial rubble pile model for comet formation says that comets agglomerate in the region where Jupiter was forming. Stardust's discovery of crystalline silicates in the dust of comet Wild 2 implies that the dust formed above glass temperature (> 1000 K) in the inner disk region around a hot young star, and was radially mixed in the solar nebula from the inner regions a larger distance from the star or the dust particle condensed in the outflow of evolved red giants or supergiants. The composition of the dust of comet Wild 2 is similar to the composition of dust found in the outer regions of the accretion disks around newly-forming stars. A comet and its dust allow investigation of the Solar System beyond the main planetary orbits. Comets are distinguished by their orbits; long period comets have long elliptical orbits, randomly inclined to the plane of the Solar System, and with periods greater than 200 years. Short period comets are usually inclined less than 30 degrees to the plane of the Solar System, revolve around the Sun in the same counterclockwise direction as the planets orbit, and have periods less than 200 years. A comet will experience a range of diverse conditions as it traverses its orbit. For long period comets, most of the time it will be so far from the Sun that it will be too cold for evaporation of ices to occur. When it passes through the terrestrial planet region, evaporation will be rapid enough to blow away small grains, but the largest grains may resist entrainment and stay behind on the comet nucleus, beginning the formation of a dust layer. Near the Sun, the heating and evaporation rate will be so great, that no dust can be retained. Therefore, the thickness of dust layers covering the nuclei of a comet can indicate how closely and how often a comet's perihelion travels are to the Sun. If a comet has an accumulation of thick dust layers, it may have frequent perihelion passages that don't approach the Sun too closely. A thick accumulation of dust layers might be a good description of all of the short period comets, as dust layers with thicknesses on the order of meters are thought to have accumulated on the surfaces of short-period comet nuclei. The accumulation of dust layers over time would change the physical character of the short-period comet. A dust layer both inhibits the heating of the cometary ices by the Sun (the dust is impenetrable by sunlight and a poor conductor of heat), and slows the loss of gases from the nucleus below. A comet nucleus in an orbit typical of short period comets would quickly decrease its evaporation rate to the point that neither a coma or a tail would be detectable and might appear to astronomers as a low-albedo near-Earth asteroid. Further assemblages and bodies Dust particles, aided by ices and organics, form \\"aggregates\\" \\"dust grains form fractal aggregates\\" (less often, \\"agglomerates\\") of 30 to hundreds of micrometers. These are fluffy, Tucson \\"fluffy aggregate\\" due to the imperfect packing of cluster-type (large) dust particles, and their subsequent, imperfect packing into aggregates.

A number of other Commonwealth realms also mark this day in this way. The awards are presented by or in the name of the reigning monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II or her vice-regal representative. British honours are published in supplements to the London Gazette. Honours have been awarded at New Year since at least 1890, in which year a list of Queen Victoria's awards was published by the London Gazette on 2 January. There was no honours list at New Year 1902, as a list had been published on the new King's birthday the previous November, but in January 1903 a list was again published, though including only Indian orders until 1909 (while the other orders were announced on the King's birthday in November). There were also no honours issued in 1940, due to the outbreak of the Second World War in September 1939. Australia has discontinued New Year Honours, as it now announces its honours on Australia Day, 26 January, and the Queen's Official Birthday holiday, in early June.

Marosa di Giorgio is considered one of the most singular voices in Latin America. Critics tend to agree that her writing is greatly influenced by European surrealism, although her vocabulary, style, and imagery are uniquely her own. Her work deals predominately with the imaginary world of childhood and nature. In the past few years, Latin American critics such as Hugo Achugar, Luis Bravo, Leonardo Garet, Sylvia Guerra, Mar√≠a Alejandra Minelli, and Mar√≠a Rosa Olivera-Williams have explored Marosa Di Giorgio's writing. Uruguayan poet Roberto Echavarren published in 1991 \\"Transplatinos\\", which offers an excellent introduction to Di Giorgio's writing. Selected poems from The March Hare have been translated into English by K.A. Kopple and published in the 1995 by Exact Change Yearbook. An article discussing gender politics, parody, and desire (as elaborated by Gilles Deleuze) also written by K.A. Kopple appeared in March 2000 in the Journal of Latin American Cultural Studies. In'Identity, Nation, Discourse: Latin American Women Writers and Artists, edited by Claire Taylor (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2009), Soledad Monta√±ez opens up a new discussion of Di Giorgio's erotic writing. Monta√±ez shows how \\"Di Giorgio's erotic prose illustrates the representation and performance of patriarchal hierarchy as a perverse comedy, creating a genre that constructs gender narratives in order to undermine the patriarchal system from within.\\"In Taylor (2009) \\"The Perverse Comedy: Genre, Gender and Identity in Marosa di Giorgio's Misales (1993), Camino de las pedrer√≠as (1997) and Rosa M√≠stica (2003)\\", p.158 Monta√±ez also affirms that \\"The effect achieved in Marosa's radicalised narrative is ultimately a mocking performance, a burlesque discourse that reveals and denounces domination and power.

A further branch ran from Brymbo to Coed Talon, where it connected with lines to Mold. The system was constructed in several stages between 1844 and 1872, while the various lines making up the system closed in 1952, 1972 and 1982. A directly competing route to Brymbo was opened by the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway in the 1880s. It closed in stages between 1954 and 1970. History The railway was one of several constructed to serve the intensive quarrying, mining and iron founding operations in the area west of Wrexham, which were undergoing considerable expansion in the mid 19th century thanks to exploitation of the underlying Middle Coal Measures. =Construction= The section of line between Brymbo and Minera had originally been part of the former North Wales Mineral Railway, built in 1844 and later incorporated into the Great Western Railway. This line's operation was constrained by the rope- worked inclines, locally known as \\"brakes\\", and tunnels along its route through the hilly country between Wheatsheaf Junction, near Wrexham, and Brymbo. As a result, an Act of 1861 proposed that a new railway, the Wrexham and Minera Railway, would be constructed from Croes Newydd, at Wrexham on the main Shrewsbury-Chester line of the Great Western Railway to Brymbo, where it would join the GWR's existing route to Minera. The new railway company would have a capital of ¬£48,000 in total (¬£36,000 of which would be in shares) and the power to enter into agreement with GWR on operational matters and division of receipts.THE SESSIONAL PAPERS, PRINTED BY ORDER OF THE HOUSE OF LORDS, IN THE SESSION 1861, VOL. XXXIII George Robert Jebb, who had previously worked on the Shrewsbury-Chester route, was appointed Resident Engineer. The line was fully completed and jointly leased to the GWR and LNWR, within whose \\"sphere of influence\\" it also fell, in June 1866.Brymbo, disused-stations.org A short branch was also constructed through to the colliery at Vron, owned by William Low, one of the Wrexham and Minera company's directors. In the 1870s a further extension, the Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway, was built from Brymbo through to an end-on connection with the LNWR's Ffrith Branch, which ran from Llanfynydd to Coed Talon near Mold. This line was jointly operated by the GWR and the LNWR - the only line in North Wales to be so operated. The completion of this link through the Cegidog valley not only gave the GWR a route to Mold, but allowed the LNWR access to the North Wales Coalfield. The construction of the Wrexham-Brymbo line led to the immediate abandonment of the North Wales Mineral Railway's original Brymbo (or \\"Brake\\") tunnel and incline. The lower section of the NWMR route from Wheatsheaf Junction, through Summerhill Tunnel, to Moss remained in use until 1908 for colliery traffic. =Introduction of passenger services= Coedpoeth Station, 1900 Between 1882 and 1905 the GWR gradually introduced passenger services between Wrexham and Minera, in response to requests from local communities. Halts or stations were located at Plas Power (Southsea), the Lodge, Brymbo, Brymbo West, Pentresaeson (for Bwlchgwyn), Coedpoeth, and Vicarage Crossing (Minera), with a passenger terminus at the rather remote Berwig Halt. From 1905 the GWR began operating a railmotor service, with as many as fifteen workings on Saturdays.Christiansen, R. Wrexham and Minera Joint Railway, orig. publ. in Railway World, Feb 1987 The LNWR ran its own passenger trains from Mold south to the joint station at Brymbo. In 1905, the businesses of Coedpoeth campaigned for the Great Western Railway company to lay a new branch from the existing Coedpoeth Station into the village centre. Local business claimed the station was too far away (being effectively located in Minera) to serve them properly and was of little convenience. Regardless, their petition failed miserably. This may have been because the gradient was simply too steep for conventional rail, as well as the little profit for a large undertaking. Despite this situation, Coedpoeth station remained a main focal point for the area, serving several villages with a combined population of around 9000 people. At the top end of the line, there was a mile-long spur, the New Brighton branch, along the flank of Esclusham Mountain serving the Delafield Minera Leadmines (which operated their own locomotive Henrietta, a Manning Wardle 0-6-0). The mines closed in 1910 and the spur was pulled up, only to be opened again for several years from 1920 to serve silica clay beds. =Route= The line ran west from Croes Newydd, steadily climbing through the farmland west of Wrexham. Shortly beyond Croes Newydd yard, the GWR's Moss Valley branch (serving several collieries near Moss, with a spur running as far as Ffrwd north of Brymbo) diverged. The main Brymbo branch continued westwards passing the industrial villages of New Broughton and Southsea, where there were connections to more collieries. Swinging northwards and still climbing, it ran along the eastern side of a rather steep valley to Brymbo, where the joint line to Coed Talon diverged just beyond the main joint station. At Brymbo Middle signalbox a short trailing branch south-west to Vron served the collieries there, passing through the steelworks en route. The section from Brymbo West onwards to Minera remained solely in GWR ownership: traversing the rural area west of Brymbo, it passed the brickworks at Cae-llo and the steel company's siding at the Smelt mine, where fireclay and coal were mined, before reaching Minera, 3 miles and 1234 yards beyond Brymbo West. This part of the route featured a large number of level crossings over minor roads. =End of passenger traffic= Site of Berwig Halt, near Minera, the final stop for passenger services. Taken in early 1960s. Competition from new bus services meant that the GWR's passenger service from Wrexham was cut back to Coedpoeth from 1926, and discontinued entirely at the end of 1930, but the small goods office and water tower were left standing at Coedpoeth, as steam locomotives needed replenishing after the hard climb from Croes Newydd. All lines continued in use for freight traffic, however, and the passenger service from Mold to Brymbo (now operated by the LNWR's successor, the LMS) continued with five trains a day on weekdays throughout the 1930s, despite there now being no onward connection to Wrexham.Llanfynydd, disused-stations.org The end section of the Vron branch was closed in 1930 along with the collieries it served, but part of its length from Vron Junction remained in use to serve the increasing steelworks traffic. Passenger traffic on the joint line from Brymbo to Coed Talon declined during the Second World War, however, with only two passenger trains a day in each direction, largely maintained for schoolchildren attending school in Mold. The passenger service was finally withdrawn in 1950 by British Railways, with the final closure of Brymbo station, although its goods siding remained open. The Brymbo-Coed Talon line was taken out of use in 1952, although it was not formally closed until 1963. =Working the route= A down freight passing the site of Brymbo West halt, with Brymbo Steelworks in the background. The route from Croes Newydd to Brymbo was double-tracked, and built to a standard designed to cope with heavy coal and freight trains to and from the steelworks. These trains were usually worked by traincrews from Croes Newydd shed using GWR 2800 Class locomotives based there; given the steep climb from Wrexham to Brymbo, which reached gradients of 1 in 36, a bank engine (such as a GWR 5600 Class locomotive) was often used. The more lightly built section beyond Brymbo West to Minera was worked by smaller locomotives, such as the 5700 Class, with engine 9610 being used almost exclusively on this line. In later years BR Standard Class 9F and ex-LMS 8F locomotives were also used on steelworks traffic. Steam locomotives continued in use on the line until relatively late under British Railways, with Class 24 and Class 25 diesels being introduced to Croes Newydd shed from 1967‚Äì8. One unusual aspect of workings on the line was that gravity shunting was permitted at Brymbo on shorter trains even as late as the 1970s.Brymbo, Railways of North Wales, accessed 27-05-10 The gradients here could be problematic: there was an incident in the 1970s in which a train ran out of control on the former Vron Branch, and broke through level crossing gates in Brymbo.Railway accidents: report to the Secretary of State for Transport on the safety record of the railways in Great Britain, HMSO, 1975, p.59 =Final closure= By the early 1970s the section of line from Brymbo West to Minera saw only two trains a week, and it was closed in 1972, shortly before Minera Limeworks was itself closed. The last part of the system, the 3-mile line from Brymbo West to Wrexham, remained open for freight trains to and from the steelworks, and as late as the mid 1970s there were 7 return workings a day. This section of line was taken out of use on 1 October 1982, due to increasing amounts of steelworks traffic being sent by road. The steelworks itself closed in 1990‚Äì91, along with a final section of the Vron Branch that had remained in use as part of the works' internal railway system. =Today= After a period of abandonment, the track was lifted in the late 1980s. Many of the line's bridges and other structures, including the platforms of the former Brymbo station, were not demolished until the 1990s. A number of structures remain, including a large stone viaduct near Ffrith on the former Joint Railway from Brymbo to Coed Talon. The Moss Valley spur between Wrexham Maelor Hospital and the site of Moss and Pentre Station has now been re-surfaced as a cycle route. Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Brymbo Branch =History= Site of Brymbo (GC) station, immediately beneath Brymbo Steelworks. The Brymbo branch of the Wrexham, Mold and Connah's Quay Railway was built to directly compete with the GWR line to Brymbo. Although originally planned in the 1860s, legal challenges by the GWR meant that it was finally constructed in the 1880s after a parliamentary bill for further expansion of the WMCQ line was tabled in 1881; the branch was built and opened to freight traffic in stages, with a full passenger service to Brymbo commencing on 1 August 1889.Journal of the Great Central Railway Society, 152, (June 2007), 38 The line left the WMCQ main line near Gwersyllt, and ran through the coal mining district of the Moss Valley, with halts at Moss and Pentre and New Broughton, where it passed under the GWR Brymbo branch before turning to run parallel to it. A small halt was provided at Plas Power, nearly adjacent to the GWR halt: there was a connection between the two lines at this point where there were sidings to Plas Power colliery. The line then headed north to Brymbo on the opposite (western) side of the valley to the GWR route; a trailing connection shortly before the tiny WMCQ Brymbo station led to a short branch to Vron and its colliery. The WMCQ terminus at Brymbo was located in a gloomy, cramped and rather inaccessible spot immediately beneath the vast slag tips on which the furnaces of Brymbo Steelworks had been built. Although the branch handled a reasonable volume of freight, passenger services on the line were never especially successful and the Great Central Railway, which had absorbed the WMCQ, discontinued them on a 'temporary' basis in 1917. They were never restarted. As a result of the Railways Act 1921, the GCR was absorbed by the London and North Eastern Railway, Brymbo becoming its most westerly outpost. The branch, sections of which had a 'difficult' combination of sharp curves and steep gradients, was worked by J58, and then by four Kitson & Co. J60 class locomotives based at Wrexham, later being replaced by J94s.The Kitson J60 (GCR Class B) 0-6-0T Locomotives, LNER Encyclopedia, accessed 27-05-10 Site of Moss and Pentre Railway Station as of early 2008. The GWR Moss Valley branch (closed in 1935 although the track was not lifted until 1952) ran over the overbridge Rather surprisingly given its duplication of the GWR route, parts of the WMCQ Brymbo branch remained open under British Railways until as late as 1970. After initial closure in 1954, a section from Gwersyllt to a coal distribution centre at Gatewen was reopened in 1958, while part of the top end of the line, from a reinstated connection with the ex-GWR line at Broughton Forge Junction (Plas Power) to the site of the former WMCQ Brymbo station and on to Brymbo Fishponds Sidings, was not taken out of use until 1970. =Today= Many of the line's structures have disappeared since the 1970s, but its formation can still be traced (and walked as a footpath) from New Broughton to Moss Valley, where there are a number of bridges. A large brick bridge still stands across the B5101 road south of Brymbo. Gallery Gallery of locations on the former line.

It is the sequel to Mappy, which was released three years earlier. The game was ported to the Wii Virtual Console in Japan on June 2, 2009. Gameplay Screenshot of the game In Hopping Mappy players control the Micro Police mouse, Mappy, as he bounces on a pogo stick to run circles around pink cats, called Meowkies, who patrol either vertically or horizontally. There is also Goro, a cat who patrols in a zigzag pattern, but he needs to take occasional breaks. There are eight treasures that a player must grab to complete a round, except on the bonus round where the player will just want to collect all the balloons that he can. The main intrigue here is getting past a blockade of Meowkies. The player controls are simple - he can bounce in any of the four directions, the only places he can land are the centres of the checkerboard squares (making for very few locations overall), and he will move at the same speed as the cats. If the player pushes the accelerator button and runs around, he will go twice as fast. When the cats have sped up (after a \\"Hurry Up\\" warning has appeared) they will match Mappy's accelerated speed. Reception In Japan, Game Machine listed Hopping Mappy as being the thirteenth most-popular arcade game of April 1986.

Early life Born in Sandhurst, Berkshire, Lawrence entered the British Army at the age of fourteen, before discovering his skill as a musician. He left the Army and toured the country in the Great Depression, seeing the suffering endured by people and joining first the unemployed workers' movement, then in 1937 the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). His opposition to the Molotov- Ribbentrop Pact led him to leave the CPGB and join instead the Trotskyist Revolutionary Workers League in 1939. A supporter of Isaac Deutscher, Lawrence followed him into the Workers International League (WIL) in 1941 and then left to join the Revolutionary Socialist League (RSL). In that organisation, he became the industrial organiser, and the prime exponent of Trotsky's Proletarian Military Policy. However, this was a policy strongly supported by the WIL, who began paying Lawrence for his activities. As a result, he was expelled from the RSL. Trotskyism Shortly after his expulsion, Lawrence was contacted by Sam Gordon of the American Socialist Workers Party, and began to work for the SWP and became the Fourth International's representative in Britain. He helped organise a fusion of the assorted Trotskyist groups into the Revolutionary Communist Party. After a spell as South Wales organiser, during which he was active in supporting Jock Haston's candidacy in the 1945 Neath by-election, he became the editor of Socialist Outlook while working as a coal miner in Cannock Chase. He allied himself with Gerry Healy to form The Club, remaining a key member through turmoil in the British Trotskyist movement. The split of Lawrence from Healy mirrored the later 1953 split in the Fourth International. Healy supported James P. Cannon and what became the International Committee of the Fourth International, while Lawrence initially supported Michel Pablo and the International Secretariat of the Fourth International. This led to a dispute over control of Socialist Outlook, which was ultimately won by Healy. Lawrence resigned as editor and began contributing instead to Tribune, a Labour Party publication. He turned increasingly towards Stalinism. He also disagreed with Pablo's attempts to get the ICFI members to attend the ISFI-organised 1954 congress of the Fourth International. He allied himself with the Socialist Union of America's position, that the FI should dissolve, and claimed he was taking Pabloism to its \\"logical conclusion\\" - much to Pablo's disagreement. Labour Party Lawrence united at the Congress with the American group and minorities of the French and Canadian groups and walked out alongside them after failed in their attempts to propose that the International should dissolve. He later claimed that he has been criticised at the congress for Stalinist views. In October 1954, he dissolved the British Section of the International Secretariat, tending to support the entry of its members into the Labour Party rather than the Communist Party. His supporters remained a loose grouping, with particular strength in car manufacturing trade union organisation. Lawrence had joined the Labour Party with The Club several years before, and in 1956 was elected leader of St Pancras Council. There he reduced rents, fought against restoring requisitioned property to the private sector, and declared May Day a paid holiday, raising the Red Flag over the Town Hall on May Day 1958 and as a result being arrested. He worked increasingly closely with the Communist Party; his support for Nikita Khrushchev's Secret Speech and the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 led to the dropping of links with the Socialist Union. Following the Red Flag incident, he was expelled from the Labour Party, and subsequently joined the CPGB with some of his supporters. For refusing to implement rent rises, he was surcharged and jailed for three months in 1960. His disagreements with the British Road to Socialism led to him leaving the CPGB again in 1964, while he moved to work for the Press Association and became an activist in the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades. Communism and syndicalism Following his disillusionment with what he saw as the CPGB's reformism and opposition to real struggle, Lawrence became a syndicalist, associated first with Solidarity, then the Syndicalist Workers Federation, the London Anarchist Group, founding Workers Mutual Aid and the London May Day Committee. In the early 1970s, he wrote extensively for Freedom, and worked on campaigns with Brian Behan, but in 1973 he was expelled from his union and moved to Shoreham-by-Sea and entered semi-retirement.

Polycephaly is the condition of having more than one head. The term is derived from the Greek stems poly (Greek: \\"œÄŒøŒªœç\\") meaning \\"many\\" and kephalƒì (Greek: \\"Œ∫ŒµœÜŒ±ŒªŒÆ\\") meaning \\"head\\". A polycephalic organism may be thought of as one being with a supernumerary body part, or as two or more beings with a shared body. Two-headed animals (called bicephalic or dicephalic) and three-headed (tricephalic) animals are the only type of multi- headed creatures seen in the real world, and form by the same process as conjoined twins from monozygotic twin embryos. In humans, there are two forms of twinning that can lead to two heads being supported by a single torso. In dicephalus parapagus dipus, the two heads are side by side. In craniopagus parasiticus, the two heads are joined directly to each other, but only one head has a functional torso. Survival to adulthood is rare, but does occur in some forms of dicephalus parapagus dipus. There are many occurrences of multi- headed animals in mythology. In heraldry and vexillology, the double-headed eagle is a common symbol, though no such animal is known to have ever existed. Occurrences The Tocci brothers as young boys in 1881. Two-headed people and animals, though rare, have long been known to exist and documented. =Occurrence in humans= Two-headed girl In humans, as in other animals, partial twinning can result in formation of two heads supported by a single torso. Two ways this can happen are dicephalus parapagus, where there are two heads side by side, and craniopagus parasiticus, where the heads are joined directly. Dicephalus parapagus dipus In dicephalus parapagus dipus, the two heads are side by side, on a torso with two legs, with varying levels of twinning of organs and structures within the torso. The shared body may have four arms altogether, or three arms, or two arms only. There are Greek- based medical terms for the variations, e.g. dibrachius means two-armed, tribrachius means three-armed. Both heads may contain a fully formed brain, or one may be anencephalic. If carried to term, dicephalus parapagus twins are usually stillborn, or die soon after birth. Survival to adulthood does however occasionally occur in cases where the twins are born with three to four arms. Chances of survival are improved if two complete hearts are present. Separation surgery is contraindicated, except in cases where one of the twins is clearly dying. Giacomo and Giovanni Battista Tocci (born between 1875 and 1877), were dicephalus parapagus dipus twins who survived to adulthood. Each had his own pair of arms. They learned to speak several languages, but never learned to walk. Abigail and Brittany Hensel, born in 1990, are another instance of dicephalus parapagus dipus twins who grew up. They were born with two functional arms, plus a vestigial third arm, which was surgically removed. Each twin has her own complete head, heart and spine, and controls one arm and one leg. They developed good motor skills, and completed courses at school and university. Craniopagus parasiticus Drawing of the eighteenth century Boy of Bengal, affected by craniopagus parasiticus. Craniopagus parasiticus is an extremely rare condition in which the two heads are joined directly together, and one twin (known as the autosite) has a functioning torso, while the other (known as the parasite) has only a vestigial torso. The parasite is supported by blood supplied from the autosite head. This threatens the life of the autosite by placing an additional burden on the autosite's vital organs. Operations to separate the two heads have been performed in the hope of saving the autosite. Skeletal structure in a case of dicephalus parapagus dipus. From: Hirst & Piersol, 1893. =Occurrence in animals= Polycephalic animals often make local news headlines when found. The most commonly observed two- headed animals are turtles and snakes. Other species with known two-headed occurrences include cattle, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, and fish. In 1894, a two- headed partridge was reported in Boston, Massachusetts. It was notable as a dicephalic animal for surviving into adulthood with two perfect heads. Scientists have published in modern journals about dissecting such animals since at least the 1930s. A 1929 paper studied the anatomy of a two-headed kitten. Polycephalic animals, due to their rarity, are a subject of novelty. \\"We\\", a two-headed albino rat snake born in captivity in 2000 with both female and male genitalia, was scheduled to be auctioned on eBay with an expected price tag of $150,000 (¬£87,000), though their policy of not trading in live animals prevented the sale. On October 31, 2006, the World Aquarium announced that \\"We\\" was adopted by Nutra Pharma Corporation, a biotechnology company developing treatments using modified cobra venom and cobratoxin. \\"We\\" died of natural causes at age eight in June 2007, not long after being acquired by Nutra Pharma. Two-headed farm animals sometimes travel with animal side shows to county fairs. Most notably, The Venice Beach Freakshow supposedly houses the largest collection of two-headed specimens in the world, including over 20 two-headed animals that are alive. Many museums of natural history contain preserved two-headed animals. The Museum of Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Ripley's Believe It Or Not! museum in Gatlinburg, Tennessee, have collections of preserved two-headed animals. A very well preserved 2-headed lamb is on display in Llanidloes museum in Wales. A live two-headed turtle named Janus can be seen at the Natural History Museum in Geneva, Switzerland. Anatomy and fitness In cases where multiple heads are fully developed and non-parasitic, they share control of the organs and limbs, though the specific structure of the connections varies. Animals often move in a disoriented and dizzy fashion, with the brains \\"arguing\\" with each other; some animals simply zig-zag without getting anywhere. Snake heads may attack and even attempt to swallow each other. Thus, polycephalic animals survive poorly in the wild compared to normal monocephalic animals. Most two-headed snakes only live for a few months, though some have been reported to live a full life and even reproduced, with the offspring born normal. A two-headed black rat snake with separate throats and stomachs survived for 20 years. A two-headed albino rat snake named \\"We\\" survived in captivity for 8 years. There is some speculation that the inbreeding of snakes in captivity increases the chances of a two-headed birth. =One or two beings?= It is difficult to draw the line between what is considered \\"one animal with two heads\\" or \\"two animals that share a body\\". Abigail and Brittany Hensel were given two distinct names at birth. They identify as two people, and are recognised as two people legally and socially. On the other hand, Syafitri, born 2006 in Indonesia, were given one name by their parents because they only had one heart. In early Germany, conjoined twins that could not be separated were legally considered a single entity. Some questions that can arise when considering the legal, moral, and ethical implications of polycephaly in humans are: If one twin commits a crime, should the innocent half be sent to prison along with the guilty half? What if the twins possess different tastes? Is it a crime if one objects to romantic advances? If one twin commits suicide, how can it be determined to not be murder? What if one twin is asleep and the other is awake? Is it academic dishonesty if one tells the other answers to a test? With other animals, polycephaly is usually described as \\"one animal with two heads\\". One of the heads, especially in three-headed animals, may be poorly developed and malformed, and not \\"participate\\" much. =Two faces on one head= Where twinning of the head itself is only partial, it can result in the condition known as diprosopus‚Äîone head with two faces. Earliest known occurrence The February 22, 2007, issue of the journal Biology Letters detailed the discovery of a 122 million-year-old fossil of a two-headed Hyphalosaurus lingyuanensis, marking the earliest known occurrence of axial bifurcation. List of recent occurrences =Humans= Dicephalic conjoined twins (dicephalus parapagus dipus) * In 1990 Abigail and Brittany Hensel were born in Minnesota, United States. * In 2000 Ayse and Sema Tanrikulu were born in Kahramanmara≈ü, Turkey * In June 2000 Carmen and Lupita Andrade were born in Veracruz, Mexico.

They died on April 30, 2008. * On August 25, 2008, a baby boy named Kiron was born with two heads in south-western Bangladesh. The baby was described by the gynaecologist present at the birth as having \\"one stomach and he is eating normally with his two mouths. He has one genital organ and a full set of limbs\\". He died on August 28, 2009. * In July 2009, dicephalic twins were born in Indonesia with two hearts but sharing all other internal organs. * In 2011 Sueli Ferreira gave birth to a child with two heads in Campina in Paraiba state, Brazil, but the baby died a few hours later because of lack of oxygen to one of the heads. * On December 19, 2011, a pair of male twins, Emanoel and Jesus Nazare, were born in Maraj√≥ Island, Brazil. The children had two heads, two legs and two arms, sharing all the body below the neck. Each child had a separate spine, but shared a heart, liver, lungs and pelvis, and both brains functioned. The boys appeared on the Channel 4 programme Bodyshock on December 19, 2012, where it was reported they had died at six months. * In March 2014 dicephalic twin girls were delivered via caesarian section at Cygnus JK Hindu Hospital in Sonipat, Haryana, in northern India. The babies reportedly have two heads, two necks and two spinal columns but share all major organs. Craniopagus parasiticus Craniopagus parasiticus is a condition in which a parasitic twin head with an undeveloped or underdeveloped body is attached to the head of a developed twin. Recorded cases include: * In 1783 the \\"Two-Headed Boy of Bengal\\" was born in India; the second head was joined roughly upside down on top of the developed twin's head. The boy survived until 1787 and was killed by a snakebite. * In 2003 Rebeca Martinez was born in the Dominican Republic with an extra head but died 7 hours after surgery at the age of 8 weeks. * In 2004 Egyptian Naglaa Mohamed gave birth to Manar Maged who had the head and undeveloped torso of another child attached. In 2005 the second head was removed and later that year Naglaa appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show with her surviving child. Manar died from a brain infection in 2006. Unconfirmed reports * In 2008 a female child named Lali Singh was born to Vinod and Sushma Singh of the Gautam Buddha Nagar district of Uttar Pradesh in India. The family refused special medical care, and later reports stated that the case was not one of polycephaly, but a condition called craniofacial duplication, a rare congenital disorder. The child died from a heart attack. =Non-human mammals= Cats Two-faced kitten, Lausanne There have been numerous reports of two-faced cats; most die soon after birth. Reports of two-headed kittens are common, relative to other animals, because of their status as household pets. Recent two-headed kittens include: * On May 20, 2020, a two-faced kitten named Biscuits and Gravy was born in Oregon. He died after three days. https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/24/us/biscuits-and-gravy-two- faced-kitten-dies-trnd/index.html * On June 11, 2013, a two-faced kitten named Deucy was born in Amity, Oregon.

T. Nelson of Cedar City, Utah on Mother's Day, May 8, 1949, to a crossbred cow owned by Willard Lund of Paragonah, Utah. The \\"Father Bull\\" is unknown but must have been an outstanding Hereford. The double calf was alive and healthy but died during birth. This calf, or calves, joined together from the beginning of the neck as far as the belly, with two complete, almost perfect body frames, had but one system of vital organs. Each of the two normal heads had a food channel to one stomach and a breathing channel, or windpipe, to the one set of lungs. The two briskets, or breasts, shared on each side by these calves, contained the one set of lungs on one side and the one heart on the other side. Branching off from the one stomach and digestive system were two channels of elimination. This calf weighed approximately 85 pounds at birth. The over-all measurements as it stands mounted are: 42.5 inches high, 20 inches from tail to tail, and 18 inches from side to side including the front legs. The \\"Mother Cow\\" lived and was sold as a \\"fat cow\\" in July 1949. This calf was stuffed by Mr. C. J. Sanders, taxidermist, 2631 South State Street, Salt Lake City 5, Utah, who stated that it is the most unusual monstrosity he has ever worked with. Dr. A. C. Johnson, of Cedar City, Utah, stated that this is the best specimen of monstrosity in animal life that he has ever seen or heard of in his 47 years of practice as a veterinarian. \\"The Dancing Calves\\" were owned by West and Gail Seegmiller who displayed them for many years at their Desert Pearl Cafe (no longer in existence), in Cedar City, Utah. Dr. A. C. Johnson, Dr. T. Donald Bell, William H. Lund, Dr. R. G. Williams, Dr. J. S. Prestwich, Dr. A. L. Graff, S. T. Nelson, and James Hoyle, Jr. all signed as witnesses that they saw the calf in the flesh soon after birth and knew it to be authentic. The calves and original document were donated to the Garth and Jerri Frehner Museum of Natural History on the Southern Utah University campus in Cedar City, Utah, where they are now on display. * The Deformed Animals Museum of Llub√≠, Spain, preserves various two- headed specimens. * A head mount of a two-headed calf is on display in the Museum at the Georgia State Capitol Building in Atlanta, Georgia. * A two- faced calf is preserved at the Douglas County Museum in Waterville, Washington.

Reportedly, the owner/rancher, J. R. Newman immediately took the calf to his local veterinarian for examination/treatment. The veterinarian, Dr. James Brown, was quoted by a local reporter as saying, \\"I've seen slight variations [of this condition] but nothing like this before. This is by no means normal.\\" * A full taxidermy of a two headed calf can be found in Melton Mowbray museum, Leicestershire, UK. * A full taxidermy of a two headed calf can be found in the Museum of Marxell (in the Northern Black Forest in Germany).

Mythological occurrences The 16th-century German zoologist Conrad Gesner has been influenced by the Beast of Revelation in his depiction of the Hydra in volume four of Historiae Animalium. =Mesopotamian mythology= * Mu≈°ma·∏´·∏´u, a seven headed serpent related to mythology of Ninurta,Cuneiform Monographs 1: Mesopotamian Protective Spirits, The ritual texts. F.A.M. Wiggermann p. 164 and Ningishzida. Sometimes related to Mu≈°·∏´u≈°≈°u. * Humbaba, the guardian of the Cedar Forest, where the gods lived. A description from Georg Burckhardt translation of Gilgamesh says, \\"he had the paws of a lion and a body covered in thorny scales; his feet had the claws of a vulture, and on his head were the horns of a wild bull; his tail and phallus each ended in a snake's head.\\" =Greek mythology= Greek mythology contains a number of multi-headed creatures. Typhon, a vast grisly monster with many snake heads, is often described as having several offspring with Echidna, a creature with the lower body of a serpent but the upper body of a beautiful woman. Their offspring, by one source or another, account for many of the major monsters of Greek mythos, including: * Cerberus ‚Äì a monstrous multi-headed dog that guards the gate to Hades. * Ladon ‚Äì a sometimes hundred-headed serpent-like dragon that guards the garden of the Hesperides and is overcome by Heracles. * Chimera ‚Äì sometimes depicted with the heads of a goat and a lion. * The Lernaean Hydra ‚Äì an ancient nameless serpent-like chthonic water beast that possessed numerous heads. * Orthrus ‚Äì a two-headed dog owned by Geryon. * Scylla ‚Äì sometimes described as a six-headed sea monster. Other multi-headed creatures in Greek mythology include: * The Hecatonchires ‚Äì giants with fifty heads and one hundred arms. The word \\"Hecatonchire\\" means \\"hundred arms\\". They were the sons of Gaia, and Uranus. * Hecate ‚Äì Greek goddess of witches, nightmares, crossroads, and one of the Moon deities; sometimes represented with three heads. =Iranian mythology= Zahhak, an evil figure in Iranian mythology - also evident in ancient Iranian folklore as A≈æi DahƒÅka (Azh dahak) - is the most significant and long-lasting of the a≈æis of the Avesta, the earliest religious texts of Zoroastrianism. He is described as a monster with three mouths, six eyes, and three heads (presumably meaning three heads with one mouth and two eyes each), cunning, strong and demonic. But in other respects A≈æi DahƒÅka has human qualities, and is never a mere animal. =Hinduism= Vishnu reclines on the multi-hooded serpent Shesha, while the four-headed Brahma sits on a lotus, rising from Vishnu's navel. Hindu deities are often depicted with multiple arms or heads. * The fire-god Agni has two heads * Dattatreya: three * The creator-god Brahma: four * The goddess Gayatri: five * The war-god Kartikeya: six Though usually depicted with one head, some deities like Ganesha (in Heramba form) and Shiva (Sadashiva) have aspects where they are depicted with multiple heads; five in this case. The Vishvarupa form of Vishnu is described as having infinite heads. Besides deities, demons (asura and rakshasa) may be depicted with multiple heads. The demon-king Ravana is depicted with ten heads; while his son Trishira with three heads. Animal races in Hindu mythology like NƒÅgas (serpents) may have multiple heads. The Naga Shesha is depicted with five or seven hoods, but said to have infinite hoods. Uchchaihshravas is a celestial seven-headed horse. The divine white elephant Airavata is depicted with multiple heads, trunks and tusks. =Taoism= * Nezha, a god sometimes shown in \\"three heads and six arms\\" form =Occultism= * Bune, a dragon with the heads of a dog, a griffin, and a man, in occultism =Ancient Mediterranean civilizations= The two-headed Janus. * Janus, a two- or four-faced god in Roman mythology * Nehebkau, a two- headed snake in Egyptian mythology =European culture= * Various Ogres, Trolls, and Giants in European folklore and fairy tales * Double-headed eagle, a heraldic symbol * Lernaean Hydra, Greek Mythology =Eastern Europe= * Balaur, a dragon with three, seven or twelve heads, in Romanian mythology *Kucedra, with three, seven or nine heads in Albanian mythology * Svantevit, four-headed god of war and divination in Slavic mythology * Triglav (meaning \\"three headed\\") is a god or complex of gods in Slavic mythology * Zmey Gorynych, a dragon in Slavic mythology * Dragons in Hungarian folklore usually have three or seven heads =Northern Europe= * √ûr√∫√∞gelmir, a six-headed giant in Norse mythology =Japan= * Yamata no Orochi, an eight-headed snake in Japanese mythology =Korea= * Jihaguk Daejeok, a nine-headed giant in Korean mythology =Judaism= The Talmud (Brachot 61a) says that originally Adam was created as a single body with two faces (which were then separated into two bodies - male (Adam) & female (Eve)). The Zohar (introduction 1:9B / p. 9B) speaks of descendants of Cain with 2 heads. The Talmud (Menachot 37a) records an incident in which Phlimo asked Judah the Prince, which head a two headed person should put on Tefillin. Judah was initially dismissive, but then another man came in saying that his wife had just given birth to a two headed baby, and asked a (different) halachic question.

Originally created by Ken Musgrave, it was marketed commercially by his Pandromeda Inc. company. Functionality MojoWorld could generate entire planets through mathematics and procedural generation, using a simple graphical interface and a planet-generation Wizard.See the long chapter by Ken Musgrave, \\"MojoWorld: Building Proceedural Planets\\", in: Musgrave et al, Texturing and Modeling: A Procedural Approach (3rd edition), Morgan Kaufmann, 2003. The resulting terrain could then be navigated in 3D space much like a videogame, allowing users to easily find exactly the right place for a scenic landscape picture. MojoWorld also allowed the user to edit the landscape and scene, and then have it rendered to an image by the computer. Rickets, Ed, \\"MojoWorld 2.0: the strangest program on the face of the planet is back, and it's better than ever\\", in-depth product review in 3D World magazine, December 2002. (Verdict: \\"9/10\\") As well as making still renders of any size, 360-degree views of the planet could also be shared by having the software render a set of 6 x 90-degree tiles covering the entire view. This could be assembled in Quicktime QTVR and shown on the Web. After Quicktime became defunct, tile assemblage was handled by Pano2VR. In 2004 a wholly free MojoWorld 3 Viewer was also released, which enabled anyone to experience, view and render from a saved MojoWorld planet file. Render size for the free Viewer was capped at \\"1024 x 465 pixels with MojoWorld watermark\\", and animations could be rendered at \\"320 x 240 pixels\\". The software was supported by a detailed 500-page manual. Users expanded the software's functionality with free plugins, such a volumetrics plugin. Versions MojoWorld 3.0 was released 2004 in Standard and Professional versions, with Pro adding official plugins such as MojoTree (forest generation) and a library of plants and planets. Version 3.1 added native support for .pz3 files created with Poser 6. The final release was MojoWorld 3.1.1 in October 2005, featuring procedural forest generation, boulders, and rocks, and enhanced atmospheres. Many users later migrated to the somewhat similar but more complex Vue landscape software. MojoWorld 3.1.1 is known to work on Windows 8.1 and 10, and at 2019 a small-but-keen groups of users gather on the Renderosity forum for MojoWorld.

Martirio de los priores de las cartujas inglesas de Londres, Nottingham y Axholme. c.1626 The Carthusian Martyrs of London were the monks of the London Charterhouse, the monastery of the Carthusian Order in central London, who were put to death by the English state in a period lasting from the 4 May 1535 till the 20 September 1537. The method of execution was hanging, disembowelling while still alive and then quartering. Others were imprisoned and left to starve to death. The group also includes two monks who were brought to that house from the Charterhouses of Beauvale and Axholme and similarly dealt with. The total was 18 men, all of whom have been formally recognized by the Catholic Church as martyrs. At the outset of the \\"King's Great Matter,\\" (the euphemism given to King Henry VIII's decision to divorce Catherine of Aragon, marry Anne Boleyn and break legal ties with the Pope) the government was anxious to secure the public acquiescence of the Carthusian monks, since they enjoyed great prestige for the austerity and sincerity of their way of life. When this attempt failed, the only alternative was to annihilate the resistance, since their refusal put the prestige of the monks in opposition to the king's will. This took the form of a long process of attrition. The First Group Despite their strict enclosure, the monks of the London Charterhouse were held in high esteem and had considerable influence among the people, as many used to consult the Carthusians for spiritual advice.Hendriks, Lawrence. The London Charterhouse, London, Kegan Paul, Trench & Co., 1889, p. 129 On 4 May 1535 the authorities sent to their death at Tyburn, London three leading English Carthusians, Doms John Houghton, prior of the London house, Robert Lawrence and Augustine Webster, respectively priors of Beauvale and Axholme, along with a Bridgettine monk, Richard Reynolds of Syon Abbey and a secular priest John Haile.Turley, K.V., \\"The London Charterhouse: Murder, Plague and Martyrdom\\", National Catholic Register, March 12, 2018 The Second Group Little more than a month later, it was the turn of three leading monks of the London house: Doms Humphrey Middlemore, William Exmew and Sebastian Newdigate. They were bound upright in chains for thirteen days before being taken to die at Tyburn, London on 19 June.Gasquet, Francis Aidan. Henry VIII and the English Monasteries, G. Bell, 1906, p. 70 Newdigate was a personal friend of Henry VIII, who twice visited him in the prison to persuade him to give in, in vain. The Third Group Vicente Carducho. Martirio de los padres John Rochester y James Walworth. The next move was to seize four more monks of the community, two being taken to the Carthusian house at Beauvale in Nottinghamshire, while Dom John Rochester and Dom James Walworth were taken to the Charterhouse of St. Michael in Hull in Yorkshire. They were made an \\"example\\" of on 11 May 1537, when, condemned on trumped-up charges of treason, they were hanged in chains from the York city battlements until dead.McNamara, Robert F., \\"Carthusian Martyrs\\" The Fourth Group Vicente Carducho. \\"Prisi√≥n y muerte de los diez miembros de la cartuja de Londres\\" (1632). Cartuja del Paular-Museo del Prado On 18 May 1537 the twenty hermits and eighteen lay brothers remaining in the London Charterhouse were required to take the Oath of Supremacy. Of these, the hermits Doms Thomas Johnson, Richard Bere, Thomas Green (priests), and John Davy (a deacon), refused. Richard Bere was the nephew, and namesake of, Richard Bere the Abbot of Glastonbury (1493‚Äì1525). The younger Bere abandoned his studies in the law, and became a Carthusian in February 1523.Blessed Richard Bere (Glastonbury Shrine) accessed 12 October 2009 Thomas Green may be the Thomas Greenwood who obtained a bachelor's degree at Oxford, and later a Master's degree at Cambridge in 1511, who became Fellow of St John's College, Cambridge in 1515 and the Doctorate in Divinity in 1532. This would associate him with St. John Fisher. Likewise, of the brothers, Robert Salt, William Greenwood, Thomas Redyng, Thomas Scryven, Walter Pierson, and William Horne also refused.Hennessey, Michael. \\"Only the Cross Stands as the World Turns\\", Seattle Catholic, 26 October 2005 As to the rest of the community, the charterhouse was \\"surrendered\\" and they were expelled. Those refusing the oath were all sent on 29 May to Newgate Prison, and treated as had been their fellow Carthusians in June 1535. They were chained standing and with their hands tied behind them to posts in the prison. This time, however, no further proceeding was foreseen and they were simply left to die of starvation. According to legend, Margaret Clement (n√©e Giggs), who had been raised by St. Thomas More, bribed the gaoler to let her have access to the prisoners, and, disguised as a milkmaid, carried in a milk-can full of meat which she fed to them. She also relieved them as best she could of the filth. However, King Henry became suspicious and began to ask whether they were already dead. When this filtered back to the gaoler, he became too afraid to let Margaret enter again. For a brief time she was allowed to go on the roof and uncover the tiles, and let down meat in a basket as near as she could to their mouths. This method meant the monks could get little or nothing from the basket, and in any case the gaoler became too afraid and stopped any contact. The lay brother William Greenwood died first, on 6 June, and two days later the deacon Dom John Davy, on 8 June. Brother Robert Salt died on 9 June, Brother Walter Pierson and Dom Thomas Green on 10 June, and Brothers Thomas Scryven and Thomas Redyng on 15 June and 16 June, respectively. These last named had survived a remarkably long time. It seems likely that at this point the King and his Council had decided upon a change of plan which entailed bringing the survivors to execution and that Thomas Cromwell gave orders that those still living were to be given food so as to keep them alive. At any rate, the hermit, Dom Richard Bere, did not die till 9 August, and Dom Thomas Johnson not until 20 September. A Lone Survivor For some reason Brother William Horne was kept alive. Refusing to abandon his religious habit, he was not attainted till 1540, when he was hanged, disembowelled, and quartered at Tyburn on August 4, 1540 along with five other Catholics: the two laymen Robert Bird and Giles Heron, Friar Lawrence Cook, Carmelite Prior of Doncaster, the Benedictine monk, Dom Thomas Epson, and (probably) the secular priest William Bird, Rector of Fittleton and Vicar of Bradford, Wiltshire.

Compile put more thought into this game after its predecessor became successful, but never knew how much of a turnaround the game would bring. Due to its highly acclaimed success, it became the most predominant game of the series. Though with many of its rules being experimental, the ability of and became a top hit immediately, thus creating longer matches for better gameplay. Also due to its successes, it became the most widely known multiplatform game in Japan, appearing in the Arcade, on major domestic consoles, on major handhelds, on the NEC PC-9800 series, on the PC, and on others. The name of Puyo Puyo 2/Ts≈´ derives from an English pun, as when spoken aloud sounds similar to the English word \\"two\\". Compile used similar puns for Puyo Puyo SUN and Puyo Puyo~n. Gameplay Just like the first game, Puyo fall from the top of the screen in pairs, can be moved left and right, and can be rotated clockwise and counter-clockwise by 90¬∞; if the third column from the left fills up to the top, the game is over. The game has multiple new rules. The first extended rule added to this game was called \\"Offsetting\\". This will allow a player to counter and negate Garbage Puyos being sent by the opponent with chains of their own. Offsetting can also be used to send the Puyos back to the opponent, known as \\"Garbage overflow\\". The standard ojamas were kept with the release of Puyo Puyo 2, however, two new garbage types also appeared, known as Point Puyos and Hard Puyos. Point Puyos, when erased adjacently with neighbouring groups of Puyos, add points to your overall score, and can also make your chains more powerful in the short-term. Hard Puyos, when they land on the field, are harder to erase than Standard Garbage or Point Puyos, and are often referred to as Steelies. Unlike its predecessor, Puyo Puyo 2 has three different modes for each type. The three main modes are, Single Puyo Puyo, Double Puyo Puyo, and Endless Puyo Puyo. For Super Puyo Puyo 2, and Super Puyo Puyo 2 Remix, using a Super Multitap, an additional mode known as Minna de Puyo Puyo (Everybody Puyo Puyo, also the name of a Puyo Puyo game for the Game Boy Advance), means that up to 4 players (though for Remix, including a COM player) can play. Single Puyo Puyo is a story mode. In an attempt not only to steal Arle's heart, but also to nab Carbuncle, the Dark Prince sets up a battle tower, in which Arle has to beat characters on each floor to climb up the tower. As Arle wins every match, she gains bonus points which add on to her total score, and this acts as Experience. The chains are balanced to be weaker and do less damage than in the first game, providing a greater chance to make a comeback. There are five predefined rule sets available in the versus menu. The player can set custom rules. Multiplayer lets multiple players play together. Development and legacy Puyo Puyo 2 was originally developed by Compile and released by Sega for arcades in 1994, and became the biggest arcade game to have been played in Japan since the arrival of Street Fighter II. The success of the game prompted Compile to port the game to several consoles and computers, including the Super Famicom, Mega Drive, PC Engine, Game Boy, Game Gear, Sega Saturn, PlayStation, PC under Windows 95, WonderSwan, Neo Geo Pocket Color, PlayStation 2, et al. The Game Boy Advance and N-Gage games Puyo Pop are also heavily based on this particular installment of the series, a Virtual Boy port was in development, but never released due to the system's failure. The Super Famicom version added a 4-player mode - Compile's first attempt at such a mode for a domestic console - with the use of a multitap. Without a multitap, 3 and 4 MAN players cannot be played. Translation group J2E would translate this version in 2001. Months later, Compile released , a special version of the Super Famicom game that allowed up to 4 players to play without the need of the multitap, by replacing the human players with computer ones. A port was also released for the PC Engine (in Super CD-ROM¬≤ format) titled . Super Puyo Puyo 2 Remix also included two new Extended Training and Special Modes, as well as other features. Another case are the PC-Engine CD, Saturn and PlayStation versions, which add voice-overs and cutscenes. The PC version of Puyo Puyo 2 was the only version to include a separate Nazo Puyo quest, as the CD versions had a \\"cut-down\\" version included into them. This version was also translated into Korean. To show the success of Puyo Puyo 2, in the Sega Ages 2500 series for the PlayStation 2, Sega released a version titled , which paid tribute to one of the most popular versions, the Sega Saturn version. Only one version of Puyo Puyo 2 was internationally released, and that was Puyo Pop for the Neo Geo Pocket Color, which was the first Puyo Puyo game to use the international title of Puyo Pop, but the third Western release after Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine and Kirby's Ghost Trap/Avalanche. For the first time, the arcade version of Puyo Puyo 2 finally saw a western release on April 26, 2016 by developer M2 for the Nintendo 3DS as a part of the Sega 3D Classics Collection game pack after nearly twelve years of being exclusive to Asia. The game itself remained untranslated. In 2019, Sega announced the Arcade version will be re-released for the Nintendo Switch under the brand. The Super Famicom version was released on SNES and Super Famicom Nintendo Switch Online and again remained untranslated for release in the west.  Reception  In Japan, Game Machine listed Puyo Puyo 2 on their November 1, 1994 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the year.

The orchestra also gave a 2004 Charity Royal Command Concert at Bangkok's National Theater at the invitation of Princess Galyani Vadhana, elder sister of the King of Thailand. This was a project of the Fund for Classical Music Promotion, a non-profit organization providing scholarships to young musicians to further their musical studies (in cooperation with the Embassy of the Philippines in Bangkok and the Ministry of Culture of Thailand). In 2006, the PPO's tour of the United States helped celebrate the centennial of the first Filipino migrants to Hawaii and California. In 2009, after an exhaustive two-year search process, the PPO and the Cultural Center of the Philippines selected Olivier Ochanine as the PPO's next Principal Conductor and Music Director to start January 2010. Under the leadership of Olivier Ochanine, the Philippine Philharmonic Orchestra became the first Filipino orchestra to perform in New York's Carnegie Hall in 2016. In May 2016 Japanese conductor Yoshikazu Fukumura became the principal conductor of the orchestra.

It was released in February 1996 under the pseudonym \\"Nearly God\\", which originated from an interview during which Tricky was asked \\"so how does it feel to be God... well, nearly God.\\"The Face - April 96 Described by Tricky as a compilation of exceptional yet unfinished demos, Nearly God was the result of a clause in his recording contract with Island Records, which allowed him to release an album once a year under a name other than his own. According to Tricky, \\"I needed it to come out, but Island would never let me release two Tricky albums in the same year\\"; his official second album Pre- Millennium Tension was released in September 1996. An austerely produced trip hop record, Nearly God was well received by critics and featured collaborations between Tricky and artists such as Alison Moyet, Bj√∂rk, Neneh Cherry, Terry Hall, and Martina Topley-Bird, who had worked with him on his previous album Maxinquaye (1995). Recording Nearly God was recorded in three weeks during the summer, in New York and London, and Tricky himself describes it as \\"a collection of brilliant, incomplete demos\\". The tracks were re-worked & mixed in London by Ian Caple & Tricky. Originally, Nearly God also included a song with Blur frontman Damon Albarn, but it was removed at the last minute, with Tricky expressing displeasure at Albarn's working methods, saying: \\"He wants to work on something for like two months and then do the vocals again and again and again, and I don't work like that.\\" The Madness of King Tricky I - Raygun 96 The song was later recorded again with former Madness singer Suggs, but this version (\\"I'll pass right through you\\") was not released either. Four of ten rumoured songs with Neneh Cherry were released on her singles \\"Woman\\", \\"Kootchi\\" and \\"Feel it\\" in 1996 and 1997. Tricky also recorded another song with Cath Coffey, a cover of the Grease song \\"Summer Nights\\" which was released in 1997 on her first album Mind the Gap (released only in Japan so far). The final product contains collaborations with Terry Hall (singer of The Specials), Alison Moyet, Cath Coffey, Neneh Cherry, Bj√∂rk and Martina Topley-Bird. The first track is a cover of \\"Tattoo\\", a b-side of popular post-punk band Siouxsie and the Banshees.Boyd, Brian. \\"He Be The Prophet\\". The Irish Times. 24 May 1996. Retrieved 12 October 2015.  Critical reception  Nearly God received positive reviews from critics. James Hunter of Rolling Stone found the music gripping, \\"recalling the early intimacy of Laurie Anderson, the raw aggression of Public Image Ltd. and the spaced oddities of Scott Walker\\". Spin magazine's Terri Sutton was impressed by Tricky's production and the record's \\"obsession with debilitating stasis\\", comparing it favourably to Sly & the Family Stone's 1971 album There's a Riot Goin' On: \\"Nearly God is most indebted to Riot for the idea that an attention to details, a precise awareness, can capture from entropy's numbing flow small gifts of nuance and emotional resonance.\\" Roger Morton from NME was less enthusiastic: \\"The loopy loops and dysfunctional mantras of Tricky's smoked- out backing tracks are less structured and more spartan than on Maxinquaye. Sometimes it sound like he's just kicked the sequencer and walked out. The onus is heavily on the singers to carry the weight, and it doesn't always work.\\" In Melody Maker, Taylor Parkes deemed it \\"a mess, albeit a hugely affecting one, a stop-gap, when three more months spent on arrangements and production would have fastered a masterpiece to surpass Maxinquaye\\". At the end of 1996, Nearly God was voted the 19th best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide, published by The Village Voice.1996 Pazz & Jop Robert Christgau, the poll's creator, later gave it a one-star honorable mention, indicating \\"a worthy effort consumers attuned to its overriding aesthetic or individual vision may well like\\". He cited \\"Together Now\\" and \\"Children's Story\\" as highlights and felt the record indulged in a sluggishness \\"true Tricky albums only play with\\". As of September 2003 it has sold 54,000 copies in United States according to Nielsen SoundScan.

Around one thousand shows are put on annually on the theatre's eight running stages. The theatre has been at its present location in the Art Nouveau building at Nybroplan, Stockholm, since 1908. The theatre was built by the architect Fredrik Lilljekvist. Famous artists like Carl Milles and Carl Larsson were involved in making the decorations,Cavilli-Bjorkman, Gorel. The World of Carl Larsson. The Green Tiger Press. 1982. . and some of the interior decorations were made by Prince Eugen. The theatre's acting school, Dramatens elevskola, produced many actors and directors who would go on to be famous, including Gustaf Molander (who also taught there), Alf Sj√∂berg, Greta Garbo, Vera Schmiterl√∂w, Signe Hasso, Ingrid Bergman, Gunnar Bj√∂rnstrand, Max von Sydow, and Bibi Andersson. The school was split off as a separate institution in 1967 (see Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting). History =17th and 18th century= Bollhuset at Slottsbacken in Stockholm during the 1780s. From right to left: Stockholm Palace, Storkyrkan, Bollhuset Theatre and the Tessin Palace. Drawing, Martin Rudolf Heland. The first Swedish theatre opened in Bollhuset and Lejonkulan in 1667 and employed only foreign companies. While the plays were sometimes open to the public, it remained more or less a court theatre. The first Swedish play, Den Svenska Spr√§tth√∂ken, was performed in 1737 by the first Swedish theatre company. The Swedish theatre was turned out of their playhouse by Queen Louisa Ulrika of Prussia after the 1753‚Äì54 season, and the playhouse was given to a French company. In 1771, king Gustav III fired the French company and encouraged Swedish talents, and thus, the Royal Swedish Opera was founded in Bollhuset. A theatre of spoken drama was founded by Fredrik Ristell in the same building in 1787, but was not to last long. In 1788 Ristell fled the country to escape his creditors. The actors formed a company and asked for the king's protection, which led to the establishment of the national theatre. Sweden's national stage for dramatic art (spoken drama) was established by King Gustav III in 1788. It was then that the Royal Theatre (Kungliga Teatern) in Sweden was officially split in two, and the Royal Theatre (today known as the Royal Swedish Opera) became thereafter solely an opera stage. For spoken drama a new theatre was built specifically, called Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern --the Royal Dramatic Theatre, to distinguish it from the Royal Theatre (the opera stage). The king became the formal director and placed the theatre under Royal protection, to be ruled by the actors themselves by votes every fourteenth day under the supervision of the Royal Swedish Academy of Arts. This rule was quite chaotic, and the voting is described as capricious and temperamental: \\"The male actors arguing with each other, one of the ladies voting yes because another lady voted no, others of them counting their buttons and letting fate decide\\",Henrikson, Alf, Fram till Nybroplan: om Kungliga Dramatiska teatern, Wiken, H√∂gan√§s, 1988 (in Swedish) and in 1803, the actors themselves asked for the system to be replaced by a director. The Royal Dramatic Theatre was located in the old premises at Bollhuset during its first years, but in 1792, the old building was deemed to be to run down, and 1 November 1793, the theatre was opened in the Palace of Makal√∂s, also called Arsenalen, where the theatre was to be located for the next thirty years; it was now often commonly called the Arsenal Theatre. In 1798, the theatres and operas of Stockholm were united by a royal monopoly, and the \\"Two Stages\\" ruled uncontested over the city for over forty years. =19th and 20th century= In 1825, the old Palace building of the theatre caught fire and burned down in the middle of a performance. The theatre was now located in the same building as the Opera, an arrangement that was to continue for almost forty years. The middle of the 19th century was to mean changes both within and without the theatre. In 1834, the actors, infuriated by a new system that replaced their percent of the theatre income by a set salary, went on strike, knowing they had succeeded with a similar action against an unpopular director in 1828. This time, however, the strike was broken by the government, which gave some of them raised salaries and fired the others with pensions. The fired actors founded a theatre company that performed all around town, and in 1842, the theatre monopoly was broken and a second theatre was founded in Stockholm; by the 1850s, there were several theatres in the city, and the Royal Dramatic Theatre experienced heavy competition, especially from the Svenska teatern (Swedish Theatre). There was much criticism about the sharing of localities between the opera and the theatre, as the localities of the Opera were built for singing and considered unsuitable for spoken drama. In 1863, the Royal Dramatic Theatre purchased the playhouse of an old rival theatre, Mindre teatern, and moved the theatre to it. Here the Royal Dramatic Theatre remained until 1907, and it was here new dramas of the 19th Century were performed: the pioneering plays of Ibsen and Chekov, as well as August Strindberg's late dramatic works, for example Till Damaskus (To Damascus). But at the beginning of the 20th century, the playhouse was rundown and in desperate need of renovation and a more modern, functional stage. From the 1880s the national stage had suffered stiff competition from several new private theatres in Stockholm, in particular, the Svenska teatern (Swedish Theatre), which was run by the charismatic theatre personality Albert Ranft. Many of the original Swedish stagings of Ibsen's plays had been produced at the Swedish Theatre instead of the national stage, as well as new German and French dramatic works, and the national stage was at the same time accused of being old, dusty and overcrowded. There was lively debate in the press on the subject of refurbishing the national stage at Kungstr√§dg√•rden. Many different kinds of restoration were proposed, but King Oscar II was not satisfied with any of the suggestions. Instead, the decision was soon made to completely tear down the old theatre building and to build a new, bigger, fresher and more modern one at a more suitable location. From the 1850s onwards, Stockholm as a city and as Sweden's definitive capital had changed considerably as had its centre. In 1881, the Royal Dramatic Theatre, which had until then been financed by the royal court‚Äîwhich gave the actors status as court staff‚Äîwas separated from the court and the royal family and made a state theatre, which was completed in 1888. The new location that was eventually picked out for the new Royal Dramatic Theatre Nybroplan was closer to what was then becoming the heart of Stockholm and was beautifully situated by the waterfront. Fredrik Lilljekvist was appointed the head architect, and on February 18, 1908, the national stage's new theatre building at Nybroplan opened with Strindberg's new play M√§ster Olof. This building is the present Royal Dramatic Theatre. Here the legendary theatre directors, brothers Olof and Gustaf Molander, Alf Sj√∂berg, and Ingmar BergmanShakespeare, William.

He was also an author and book illustrator. Life He was born in Kettering, Northamptonshire on 11 February 1841, the second son of Henry John Nettleship, a solicitor there, and brother of Henry Nettleship, Richard Lewis Nettleship, and of Edward Nettleship, the ophthalmic surgeon. His mother was Isabella Ann, daughter of James Hogg, vicar of Geddington and Master of Kettering Grammar School. Nettleship was for some time a chorister at New College, Oxford. Afterwards he was sent to the cathedral school at Durham, where his brother Henry had preceded him. Having won the English verse prize on the subject of \\"Venice\\" in 1856, he was taken away comparatively young, in order to enter his father's office. There he remained for two or three years, finishing his articles in London. Admitted a solicitor and in practice for a brief period, he decided to devote himself to art, and entered himself as a student at Heatherley's and at the Slade School in London, but was largely self-taught. For twenty-seven years (1874‚Äì1901) he exhibited spacious oil pictures of lions, tigers, etc., at the Royal Academy and for most of the period at the Grosvenor Gallery. In 1880 Nettleship was invited to India by the Gaekwar of Baroda, for whom he painted a cheetah hunt as well as an equestrian portrait. In his later years he took to the medium of pastel, and, painting his old subjects on a smaller scale, enjoyed greater popularity. Arthur W.E. O‚ÄôShaughnessy's poem \\"A Neglected Harp\\" in Epic of Women (1870) Nettleship was far more than a painter. His intellectual sympathies were unusually wide. In 1868, when only twenty-seven, he published a volume of Essays on Robert Browning's Poetry, which was probably the first serious study of the poet. It passed through three editions with considerable enlargements. The third edition was titled Robert Browning: Essays and Thoughts (1895). The book brought about an intimate friendship between the poet and his critic. Another book that shows both his mature power of literary expression and his opinions about his own art is George Morland and the Evolution from him of some Later Painters (1898). Here there are touches of self-portraiture. He was one of The Brotherhood, a group of the 1870s including John Butler Yeats and Edwin John Ellis. They were admirers of William Blake, on friendly terms with the Pre- Raphaelites or at least the Rossetti brothers, and part of the Bedford Park social and artistic group. He created a group of what he called \\"Blake drawings\\" exploring the style of the poet-artist. He also made the Blake- influenced illustrations to Arthur O'Shaughnessy's poetry collection Epic of Women and other poems in 1870. Nettleship died in London on 31 August 1902, and was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery. A memorial tablet in bronze, designed by Sir George Frampton, with the aid of two locally born artists, Sir Alfred East and Thomas Cooper Gotch, was placed in the parish church at Kettering. Writing He wrote in Essays on Robert Browning's poetry (1868) the first major work of criticism on Browning, whose mid-century reputation was in the doldrums. This brought him Browning's friendship. He was prominent as a founder of the Browning Society. He wrote also a biography of the artist George Morland, George Morland and the Evolution from him of some Later Painters (1898). Family In 1876, he married Ada, a fashion designer and the daughter of James Hinton. She survived him with three daughters, the eldest of whom, Ida, was an artist and the first wife of the artist Augustus John.

The by-election was the first seat to change hands in the 2005 Parliament when Willie Rennie won the seat for the Liberal Democrats, a gain from Labour, by 1,800 votes. The BBC reported a swing from Labour to the Liberal Democrats of 16.24%. It was the first time Labour had lost a seat at a Westminster by-election in Scotland since the Scottish National Party won the Glasgow Govan by-election in 1988, and the first time Labour had ever lost to the Liberal Democrats, or their predecessors the Liberal Party, in a Scottish Westminster by-election. The by-election took place in the middle of a leadership election in the Liberal Democrats and the party was perceived in the media to be declining in the polls as a result of negative publicity surrounding the resignation of former leader Charles Kennedy and revelations about the private lives of Mark Oaten and Simon Hughes. The constituency of Dunfermline and West Fife was first created for the United Kingdom Parliament at the 2005 general election and saw a comfortable Labour win at that election. It was the second Westminster by-election in a Scottish constituency since the 2005 general election. In the 2005 Livingston by-election, Labour retained the seat with the Scottish National Party second but 2,680 votes behind. The Livingston constituency lies just across the Firth of Forth from the Dunfermline and West Fife constituency. Campaign The Courier reported on 23 January that leaked minutes of a meeting on 11 January at Westminster revealed that \\"senior Scottish Liberal Democrats do not believe their party has any chance of winning the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election\\", and that \\"their aim is to beat the SNP rather than topple Labour\\". This suggestion was backed up on 27 January by a poll in the Daily Telegraph that put the Lib Dems at 13% UK-wide (down 9% on Election 2005), their worst position since the 2001 general election. The Sunday Herald reported on 29 January that they had \\"evidence of a high-level \\"fix\\" to select (the Labour) candidate\\", because \\"party bosses sent out a leaflet on behalf of Catherine Stihler‚Äôs campaign hours before she was selected to fight the seat.\\" This story followed earlier reports of a similar row over the selection of the Conservative and Unionist candidate: Fife Tory leader Stuart Randall‚Äôs claim that he was left off the shortlist for being \\"far too old and middle-aged to fit the bill\\". Randall, who stood as Conservative candidate against Gordon Brown in Dunfermline East at the 2001 and 2005 general elections and fought Dunfermline East at the 2003 Scottish Parliament election, was aged only 43. Local Conservative activists were reported to be furious that such a high-profile local figure was left off the shortlist of candidates for the by-election. The by-election electorate for the constituency was 72,225, a slight increase (of 2.04%) on the general election in May 2005. Implications (on UK and Scottish elections) The constituency neighbours Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, the seat of Gordon Brown, former Leader of the Labour Party and Prime Minister. Brown actually lived in the Dunfermline and West Fife constituency. The constituency is also near to North East Fife, then the constituency of Sir Menzies Campbell, former leader of the Liberal Democrats (only a leadership contender at the time). Prior to the election it was speculated that a poor showing for either party in the vicinity of Brown and/or Campbell's political bases could impact upon their chances of winning their respective parties' leaderships. The result of this Westminster by-election were seen as a litmus test of the parties' standing prior to the 2007 Scottish Parliament election; the Liberal Democrats proceeded to win the Dunfermline West seat, which comprises the bulk of Dunfermline and West Fife, from Labour in the 2007 Holyrood election. The results of all by-elections in Scotland have been particularly highly valued by psephologists and political commentators since the demise of the last regular, monthly Scottish voting-intention poll (by The Herald and Taylor Nelson Sofres System 3) at the end of 2003. The result was also notable as it came at a time when Labour's national opinion poll ratings were very high. Immediately after the election the Liberal Democrats claimed that the results showed they were the challengers to the Labour Party and that the Conservatives had failed their first electoral test under their new leader.

The film follows a low- ranking mafioso who is ordered by his boss to get rid of a gun used to kill corrupt cops and finds himself in a race against time when the gun ends up in the wrong hands. The film was released theatrically in the United States on February 24, 2006. Plot Joey Gazelle, a low-ranking mafioso working alongside New Jersey mobster Tommy Perello, is present when a large drug deal with a Jamaican gang goes awry. A trio of corrupt cops led by Rydell storm in to rob the criminals, but his two police accomplices are killed in the ensuing shootout. Tommy tells Joey to get rid of the incriminating guns, but Joey goes home to his wife Teresa and their twelve-year-old son Nicky. There Joey sees Teresa bending to put clothes in washing machine. When she bends, her pants lower down and her panties and lower buttocks become visible. Seeing this Joey quickly comes and grabs her butt and then keeps his hands on her hip and starts kissing her on cheeks, ears and neck. And then he lifts her onto the top of the washing machine and proceeds to undo her pants and starts kissing her belly and then he grabs her panties and pushes them sidewards and starts to kiss her vagina. Then he goes towards her lips and kissing her on all her body. Then she also removes his pants and grabs his buttocks and starts to remove her pants. Then she goes out as she has no interest at that time and puts on her pants. Then Joey comes and presses her boobs and kisses her and goes to basement. Nicky and his friend from next door, Oleg, secretly watch as Joey stashes the guns in the basement. And then Oley pretends to go to his house and then Teresa goes to dry the clothes where Joey comes and taps her butt and goes out. Oleg steals one of the guns before heading home to his mother Mila and abusive stepfather, Anzor, the nephew of Russian mob boss, Ivan. When Anzor becomes belligerent, Oleg shoots him. Joey, attracted by the gunshot, finds Anzor lightly wounded and Oleg gone. When Anzor describes the gun, Joey realizes it is one of the weapons traceable to the earlier killings. Joey then realizes that he must track down Oleg and the missing gun before the police do. Throughout the night, Oleg runs into many unsavory people. A homeless man, then a drug dealer, and finally an abusive pimp named Lester and his prostitute, Divina. After Oleg helps Divina, she decides to look after the boy. She takes him to a diner, where they run into Joey and Nicky. Joey is there to explain to Frankie Perello, the Italian mob boss, that Oleg has the gun, but (falsely) states that it was not fired during the shootout. Nicky and Oleg stash the gun in the diner bathroom, and after Oleg leaves with Divina, the police catch Oleg and return him to Anzor. Oleg soon escapes from Anzor, then is taken in by a kindly married couple, Dez and Edele, and their two young children. When Oleg becomes suspicious of them, he sneaks Edele's cell phone and secretly calls Teresa. Teresa arrives, threatens her way inside the apartment, but finds no sign of Oleg. She threatens Dez, who leads her to a closet, where Oleg is tied up with a plastic bag over his head. Teresa saves him, then holds the couple at gunpoint and tells Oleg to get the other kids and leave. When Teresa finds children's costumes, plastic body bags and snuff films, she calls the police from Edele's cell phone, reports gunshots, hangs up, and then murders them both. Throughout all of this, Joey has been searching for the missing gun, and is finally about to get it back. However, just before he can, both he and Oleg are caught by Tommy and Sal, another one of Frankie's thugs. They take Joey and Oleg to a remote landfill, where Tommy threatens Joey at gunpoint, but suddenly kills Sal instead. Tommy then reveals that he had just learned that Sal was an informant helping Rydell. At the same time, Rydell is killed by a bomb Tommy had planted. Tommy then takes Joey and Oleg to an Ice Hockey Rink to meet Frankie and rival mob boss Ivan. Ivan has brought Anzor, to try and get Oleg to tell them the source of the gun he used to shoot Anzor. When Ivan slaps the boy, Joey lashes out at Ivan, and he, in turn, is subdued and beaten by Ivan's thugs. When Anzor refuses Ivan's order to kill Oleg, Ivan kills Anzor. When Ivan turns to kill Oleg, Joey distracts him by accusing Frankie of planning to kill the Russians because Anzor was cooking meth to sell in Frankie's territory. A shootout ensues between the Russians and Italians, with one thug killing Tommy while Frankie personally kills Ivan. Frankie turns to shoot Joey - who suddenly reveals he is actually an undercover FBI agent, showing a hidden wire under his shirt. Oleg then distracts Frankie, enabling Joey to disarm and kill him. Joey and Oleg then exit just as the FBI and local police storm the building. Joey and Oleg then stop at a diner for breakfast before heading home. As they are leaving, Lester emerges, holding the gun that Oleg had hidden earlier. In the ensuing struggle, Lester shoots Joey in the stomach, but not before Joey fatally stabs Lester with a switchblade. Joey and Oleg struggle to return to Teresa and Nicky. Meanwhile, Mila, thinking Oleg is dead, commits suicide by blowing herself up in Anzor's meth lab. Just as Teresa and Nicky rush outside to investigate, they see Joey crash his car after losing consciousness. Days later, Teresa, Nicky, and Oleg attend Joey's funeral; Oleg has been adopted into the family. They drive out to a small farmhouse, where Joey emerges, having faked his death for his protection from those exposed by his work as an FBI undercover officer.

He was born in Saint Thomas, Jamaica and died of Parkinson's disease in St Catherine, Jamaica at the age of 67. Gilchrist's Test career might have been longer had he not been sent home halfway through West Indies' 1958‚Äì59 tour of the Indian subcontinent after disagreements with captain Gerry Alexander. One cause of this was Gilchrist's \\"penchant for bowling beamers from 18 yards\\" as Cricinfo has put it, as well as off-field arguments. This involved deliberately overstepping the bowling mark by four yards to come closer to the batsman and intimidate him. In the Fourth Test at Nagpur, after Indian batsman A. G. Kripal Singh had struck three consecutive boundaries and taunted him, Gilchrist deliberately overstepped the bowling mark by six metres and delivered a bouncer which hit the Sikh batsman on the head and dislodged his turban. In the following match, against North Zone, he unleashed a barrage of beamers against Swaranjit Singh, whom Alexander had known at Cambridge. He ignored his captain's instruction to cease this form of attack. During the lunch interval Alexander substituted him, and he was subsequently sent home, while the other players proceeded to Pakistan for the remainder of the tour. Alexander told him: ‚ÄúYou will leave by the next flight. Good afternoon.‚Äù This marked the end of his Test career. There were suggestions that he had pulled a knife on Alexander.Daily Telegraph obituary of Alexander Retrieved 20 April 2011 He later attracted attention while playing in the Lancashire League by removing a stump from the playing arena and striking an opposition batsman in the head.

It was a conscious effort by Tricky to depart away from the trip hop label with which critics had described his previous music. The album was well received by critics, being named the ninth best record of the year in the 1996 Pazz & Jop poll. Background In an October 1996 interview for Ray Gun, Tricky said he wanted to make Pre-Millennium Tension an \\"out-an-out punk record\\" to get away from the trip hop label with which his previous work had been categorized by critics. He said, \\"I thought it was going be heavier... What I wanted to do was a total fast album. Some of the tracks are fast and hard, but they didn't come out like that.\\" The album was mainly recorded in Jamaica, and other parts were recorded at Platinum Islands Studio, New York. It was recorded & mixed & programmed by Ian Caple. Recorded in Grove Studios, Ocho Rios, Jamaica & mixed at El Cortijo Studio in Spain. According to PopMatters writer Wayne Franklin, Pre-Millennium Tension \\"revealed a new, more sinister sound, most likely attained due to his move to New York City and his work with underground rappers ... containing the singles \\"Christiansands\\" (the biggest hit of his career), \\"Tricky Kid\\", and \\"Makes Me Wanna Die\\" (which contains a sample of Eric B. & Rakim‚Äôs \\"To the Listeners\\")\\". Critical reception Pre-Millennium Tension received positive reviews from critics, who found the record's music ambitious, eclectic, and threatening. USA Today reviewer Elysa Gardner called it a dazzling trip hop album and Tricky \\"prolific, innovative and fearlessly eccentric\\", comparing him to American musician Prince. In the Chicago Tribune, Greg Kot said Tricky had transcended the boundaries of trip hop by drawing upon and manipulating a number of styles, including ambient, drum and bass, hip hop, and dancehall, in his evocative production. \\"Few records have more artfully blurred the boundaries between sensuality and terror, fascination and fear, seduction and confusion\\", Kot wrote. David Bennun from The Guardian argued that Tricky had deconstructed hip hop clich√©s and \\"gangsta-isms\\" into bizarrely malcontent songs on what was an \\"astonishing record ‚Äì not a great one, but a very good, very awkward and very strange one\\". Village Voice critic Robert Christgau found his use of hip hop soundscapes compelling on a record that \\"comprehends and inhabits the dystopia of everyday life more radically than Wu-Tang could conceive\\". He qualified his praise by adding that the success of Tricky's formula relied heavily on Topley-Bird. Simon Williams of NME was less impressed, writing that the album's last few songs \\"seemed to suffer from the very fury which makes the rest of the record work\\". He singled out \\"My Evil Is Strong\\" and \\"Piano\\" for overindulging in cynical attitudes and monotonous music. David Browne was more critical in Entertainment Weekly. He believed Tricky's incorporation of more soul and reggae elements than Maxinquaye, as well as his use of spasmodic beats and \\"revue-style singers\\", had weakened his \\"trademark trip-hop\\" style and resulted in a more theatrical, \\"pretentious\\" record. At the end of 1996, Pre-Millennium Tension was voted the ninth best album of the year in the Pazz & Jop, an annual poll of American critics nationwide. It was later included in Q magazine's \\"50 Heaviest Albums of All Time\\". In a 1997 interview between journalist Liz Jones and Prince, Jones told Prince he should listen to Tricky, because Tricky reminds her of Prince earlier in his career. Intrigued, Prince asks her the name of Tricky's latest album; she said Pre-Millennium Tension, and Prince spontaneously answered, \\"well, isn't that another way to say ‚Äò1999‚Äô\\" (1999 being Prince's breakthrough album released in 1982.) This interview is featured in Liz Jones' book Slave to the Rhythm. In 2017, Nate Patrin of Pitchfork noted the album's longevity, saying that the album's name \\"is the only obvious thing that tells you it‚Äôs two decades old rather than two weeks.\\" As of 2003 \\"Pre-Millennium Tension\\" has sold 218,000 copies in US. As of 1996 the album has sold 450,000 units worldwide according to Billboard.

Towards the end of her time at the Slade, she met Gwen's brother Augustus John, and they married on 24 January 1901. They honeymooned in Swanage and initially took a flat in Fitzroy Street, London, but John was soon appointed a temporary professor at the school of art at University College, Liverpool. They remained in Liverpool for 18 months, and it was there that the first of their five sons, David Anthony Nettleship, was born in January 1902. He later became a musician and postman. A portrait of Ida by John from around 1901, while she was in her first pregnancy, is held by the National Museum of Wales. The family moved to London in 1903, where John co-founded Chelsea Art School with William Orpen. Their second son Caspar John was born in London in March 1903; he became an officer in the Royal Navy. Later in 1903, Nettleship's life with John was complicated when Dorelia McNeill became John's model and mistress. From 1903 to 1907, the three lived together in a m√©nage √† trois, first at Matching Green in Essex and from 1905 in Paris. Nettleship had three further sons with John in quick succession: Robin (born 1904 in Essex), who became a linguist; Edwin (born 1905 in Paris), who became a boxer and watercolourist; and Henry (born 1907 in Paris), who became a religious philosopher. During this period, Dorelia also had children with John, in 1905 and 1906. Given John's limited income and the growing family, Nettleship eventually gave up painting to take care of the children and the housework. Although she found this wearisome and considered leaving John, she did not live long enough to do so. She died of puerperal fever in Paris in 1907 after the birth of her fifth son, Henry. She was cremated at the P√®re Lachaise Cemetery. John remained with Dorelia after Nettleship's death, and they brought up Nettleship's children. Despite the fact that Nettleship was John's wife, housekeeper, and the mother of five of his children, there is not a single mention of Nettleship in Chiaroscuro, John's 1952 memoir. The Good Bohemian, an edition of Nettleship's letters, was published in 2017; it was edited by John's granddaughter Rebecca John and John's biographer Michael Holroyd.

A big-hitting right-handed batsman, Clarke played five One Day Internationals for the Netherlands in the 1996 Cricket World Cup. At the age of 47, he was the oldest cricketer to play in the World Cup. He once topped the six hitting tally in the Hong Kong Sixes, a tournament that included Brian Lara. School times Clarke was educated at St Michael's parish, which was the same school that West Indian cricketers Vanburn Holder and David Murray went to. Domestic career He represented Barbados in first-class cricket from 1970 until 1978 and played 26 games for them in total. His highest first- class score of 159 was made against Mike Denness's touring England side in 1973‚Äì74. He then began coaching in the Netherlands and played for Quick Haag before moving to Sparta 1888 in Rotterdam. His score of 265 not out for Quick against Bloemendaal in 1990 remains the highest score ever made in Dutch domestic cricket. In 1995 he made 86 for the Netherlands in a NatWest Trophy game against Northamptonshire. International career When the Netherlands qualified for the 1996 World Cup, Clarke was heavily influential in getting them there, having made 121 not out against Bermuda in a crucial 1994 ICC Trophy play-off match. Clarke played in all five of the Netherlands' World Cup matches as an opening batsman, though he scored only 50 runs at an average of 10. He did, however, achieve two records: in the first match he became, at the age of 47 years and 240 days, both the oldest One Day International debutant and player in history. He beat the previous record for oldest debutant, held by England's Norman Gifford, by almost three years, and the previous record for oldest player, held by Zimbabwe's John Traicos, by almost two years. In 2005 Clarke returned to cricket at the age of 56 to play for VVV Amsterdam in the Hoofdklasse and after a gap of six years, he hit 782 runs. He also aired trenchant opinions on the state of cricket in the Netherlands. Clarke has retired from playing, but remains active as a coach in the Dutch youth programme.

An all-rounder, he played 41 Test matches for South Africa from 1955 to 1970. He captained the young South African team on its five-month tour of Australia and New Zealand in the 1963‚Äì64 season, levelling the series with Australia, and was also captain in 1964‚Äì65 against England in South Africa. A left- handed, classically correct opening batsman, he was also a successful left-arm medium-pace bowler with 123 wickets at Test level. Among Test bowlers with 75 wickets or more, he is the most economical of all, conceding an average of only 1.64 runs per over.Wisden Cricketers' Almanack 2012, p.1305. He enjoyed particular success at first-class level, with over 11,000 runs at 40.60 together with 534 wickets and a competitive 21.65. He played for Natal from 1952 to 1953 to 1965‚Äì66, for North-Eastern Transvaal in 1966‚Äì67 and 1967‚Äì68, then returned to Natal for his last two seasons, 1968‚Äì69 and 1969‚Äì70. The cricket journalist Telford Vice has described Goddard as \\"a man of rare grace, intelligence and spirit\\".\\"A meeting of past and present\\" Sir Donald Bradman said he was \\"a completely reliable and honest player who could be depended upon before any season started to put up a sterling performance over a whole series\\", praised his \\"qualities of sincerity and integrity\\", and said that he \\"enriched the game of cricket and set a fine example\\".Graham Short, The Trevor Goddard Story, Purfleet, Durban, 1965, p. 3. Early life and career Born in Durban, South Africa, Trevor Goddard was the youngest in a family of four boys whose father was a linotype operator with the Natal Mercury.Short, p. 13. Trevor played in the first XI at Durban High School from 1946 to 1948, scoring several centuries and taking many wickets as a left-arm orthodox spinner, often bowling in tandem with Arthur Tayfield, Hugh's younger brother.Short, pp. 16‚Äì17. Along with Arthur Tayfield, he played in the South African Schools XI in 1948‚Äì49. Fully grown, he stood six feet two inches. He changed to pace bowling when he began playing for the Tech club in Durban, which had a spin bowler (the Natal left-armer Les Payn) and needed a medium-pacer.Short, p. 15. He also played soccer for Natal, but gave it up in 1954, partly to avoid injuries that might jeopardise his cricket career, and partly because he did not think it fair to ask his employers to give him leave to play two sports.Short, p. 18. He made his first-class debut for Natal against Transvaal at Durban in 1952‚Äì53, opening the bowling and batting at number seven. In his third match he hit his first century, 100 not out against Eastern Province, and he finished the season with 433 runs at 43.30 and 18 wickets at 30.00. The next season, he opened the batting for Natal with the captain, Jackie McGlew, and in his second match as opener he hit 174 and took 5 for 73 (also opening the bowling) against Western Province. He continued to perform consistently, helping Natal to victory in the Currie Cup in 1954‚Äì55 with 460 runs at 51.11, 10 catches, and 9 wickets at 16.00 in six matches, and was selected to tour England in 1955. In September 1954 he married Jean, who was born in England. They eventually had two children.Short, pp. 23‚Äì24. Early Test career =1955 series= In 23 matches on the 1955 tour he hit 1163 runs at 30.60 and took 60 wickets at 21.90. He played in all five Tests, opening the batting and, in two Tests, the bowling as well. In a series in which bowlers dominated, he took 25 wickets at 21.12 and made 235 runs at 23.50. He played a big part in the victory in the Fourth Test at Leeds, making 9 and 74 (in an opening partnership of 176 in four and a quarter hours with McGlew after South Africa had trailed by 20 on the first innings) and taking 2 for 39 and 5 for 69. On the last day he \\"bowled over the wicket without relief from 11.30 a.m. until the match was won at 4.12 pm\\", finishing with figures of 62‚Äì37‚Äì69‚Äì5.Wisden 1956, pp. 250‚Äì51. Summing up the tour, Norman Preston wrote that although Goddard \\"was obviously a cricketer of great possibilities\\"', he was mostly a \\"defensive cricketer\\": \\"When batting, survival at the crease was his main consideration, and when bowling ... he aimed persistently at or outside the leg stump to a field set suitably for those tactics\\".Norman Preston, \\"South Africans in England, 1955\\", Wisden 1956, p. 221. =1956‚Äì57 series= When England toured South Africa in 1956‚Äì57, in another series dominated by the bowlers Goddard top-scored in four innings and led the South African aggregates and averages with 333 runs at 33.30, with a top score of 69. He also took 12 catches, which remains the South African record for a series (shared with Bert Vogler and Bruce Mitchell) and 15 wickets at 24.66. Wisden's summary said he was now \\"one of the big personalities in world cricket\\", but described his leg-side bowling as \\"not pretty to watch\\".Leslie Smith, \\"M.C.C. Team in South Africa, 1956‚Äì57\\", Wisden 1958, p. 812. =1957‚Äì58 series= His bowling was less effective against the Australians the following season, yielding only 7 wickets at 59.57, but he scored 284 runs at 35.50. He hit 90 in the first innings of the First Test, when he put on 176 for the first wicket with McGlew, a record against Australia. In the second innings of the Second Test he opened and carried his bat for 56 not out in a team total of 99 all out and an innings defeat. He batted at number five in the Third Test, number four in the Fourth Test, then returned to open in the Fifth.\\"Australians in South Africa, 1957‚Äì58\\", Wisden 1959, pp. 775‚Äì802. He maintained his form in the next two domestic seasons, taking 6 for 3 (figures of 11‚Äì9‚Äì3‚Äì6) when Natal dismissed Border for 16 in 1959‚Äì60, and making his first double-century, 200 against Rhodesia, two weeks later. He also captained Natal for the first time in one match (which Natal won). =1960 series= He toured England in 1960, an unsuccessful tour for South Africa that John Arlott described as \\"the unhappiest ever made by a party of overseas cricketers in England\\".John Arlott, The Essential John Arlott, Willow, London, p. 135. The team vice-captain to McGlew, Goddard made 220 runs at 24.44 and took 17 wickets at 24.35 in the five Tests, although a new restriction of fielders on the leg side prevented his use of his more defensive bowling methods.Norman Preston, Wisden 1961, p. 267. In the Fifth Test, after England had been dismissed for 155 in the first innings, Goddard batted for six hours and 10 minutes in scoring 99 and helping South Africa to a lead of 264; but the match was drawn after a second-innings recovery by England and rain on the last day.Wisden 1961, pp. 302‚Äì4. In 24 matches on the tour he scored 1377 runs at 37.21, with four centuries, and took 73 wickets at 19.71, including career- best match figures of 10 for 79 against Lancashire. He captained the team in five matches.Norman Preston, \\"South Africans in England, 1960\\", Wisden 1961, pp. 264‚Äì308. He played only part of the 1960‚Äì61 season. In August 1961 he and his family went to live in England for a year. He had a job with Decca Records in London, and on weekends during the 1962 English cricket season he played as the club professional for Great Chell in the North Staffordshire League. He set a league record for runs in a season, scoring 1128 runs at 94.00, as well as taking 64 wickets at 12.15.Wisden 1963, pp. 780‚Äì81. He believed his season with Great Chell changed his attitude to playing. The clubs depend almost entirely on their professional, who must develop what Goddard called the \\"killer instinct\\".Short, p. 98. He returned to South Africa for the 1962‚Äì63 season, scoring 723 runs at 65.72 with four centuries, and taking 19 wickets at 21.31, as \\"his medium-paced deliveries gave indications of new-found subtlety\\".Geoffrey Chettle, \\"Cricket in South Africa, 1962‚Äì63\\", Wisden 1964, p. 857. Test captaincy =1963‚Äì64 series= Goddard was appointed captain of South Africa on its five-month tour of Australia and New Zealand in 1963‚Äì64. His employer was unable to give him so much leave, and he was only able to tour because the cricket-loving director of a large Durban store offered him a public relations position and time off to play cricket.Short, pp. 18‚Äì19, 99. He suffered from severe sinusitis during the early part of the tour and spent time in hospital in Perth and Brisbane, where an operation after the First Test relieved the condition.Short, pp. 108‚Äì9, 132. He scored 454 runs at 64.85 and took 11 wickets at 38.18 in the five Tests against Australia,Wisden 1965, pp. 819‚Äì20. and led his young side to a one-all result with three Tests drawn. Sir Donald Bradman said he had \\"little doubt the South African side should have won the series\\" had they, and especially Goddard, had more confidence in their ability.Short, 1965, p. 3. Wally Grout agreed, saying, \\"Time and time again in the series, when a little boldness would have carried them through, they chose caution.\\"Wally Grout, My Country's Keeper, Pelham, London, 1965, pp. 116‚Äì17. Nevertheless, Goddard believed that, after the victory in the Fourth Test, \\"South Africa had at long last come out of its post-war chrysalis and had spread its wings as a Test-winning nation\\".Short, p. 150. The three-Test series in New Zealand that followed finished with all matches drawn, although South Africa, despite being reduced at one stage to eleven fit men,Short, p. 162. had by far the better of all three matches. Goddard scored 233 runs at 46.60 and took 7 wickets at 20.28 (series figures of 140‚Äì81‚Äì142‚Äì7).Wisden 1965, pp. 820‚Äì21. He remarked at the end of the series that \\"with the weather and the playing conditions in New Zealand you can't expect to play good cricket\\".Peter Pollock, The Thirty Tests, Don Nelson, Cape Town, 1978, p. 47. =1964‚Äì65 series= He took up the post of cricket organiser of the privately financed Sport Foundation of South Africa in late 1964.Short, p. 191. Goddard was appointed captain for the five-Test series against the visiting English side in 1964‚Äì65. However, after England won the First Test and the next two were drawn, the selectors asked him to relinquish the captaincy. They wanted him to issue a statement, \\"the gist of which was that he had asked to be relieved of the captaincy\\". He refused to do so, and they let him remain captain for the rest of the series. When he scored his only Test century, 112, in the Fourth Test, \\"almost the entire England team moved over to congratulate this most popular player. The crowd rose for fully a minute. It was an inspiring spectacle.\\"Jackie McGlew, Cricket Crisis, Hodder & Stoughton, London, 1965, p. 116. Goddard finished the series with 405 runs at 40.50, and 6 wickets at 51.66.Wisden 1966, p. 796. Disappointed with the way he had been handled, he told the selectors during the Fourth Test that he would retire from Test cricket at the end of the series and would consequently be unavailable for the tour to England in 1965. They later offered him the captaincy of the touring team, but he was adamant.Short, pp. 186‚Äì87. Later Test career =1966‚Äì67 series= He played the 1965‚Äì66 season for Natal, and at the end of the season he captained South to an overwhelming victory against North in a trial match, making 102 and taking 6 for 30 in the respective first innings. He captained a strong South African XI to an important victory against the Australian touring team early in December 1966,Wisden 1968, p. 838. then made his highest score, 222 for North-Eastern Transvaal against Western Province a few days later. Under the captaincy of Peter van der Merwe (who in 1965 had named his son Trevor after Goddard)Short, pp. 187. he played all five Tests against the Australians, scoring 294 runs at 32.66 and having his most successful series with the ball, taking 26 wickets at 16.23. After the Australian second innings in the First Test, when he took his best Test figures of 6 for 53 to give South Africa its first-ever Test victory over Australia in South Africa, he was carried off the field shoulder-high by the jubilant crowd.Peter Pollock, The Thirty Tests, Don Nelson, Cape Town, 1978, pp. 92‚Äì93. Asked why the Australians had found Goddard's deliveries so hard to play, Denis Lindsay replied, \\"Trevor's swinging them in circles.\\"Peter Pollock, The Thirty Tests, Don Nelson, Cape Town, 1978, pp. 96. Eight of the South Africans who won the series 3‚Äì1 had toured in Goddard's team in 1963‚Äì64.Geoffrey Chettle, \\"Australia in South Africa, 1966‚Äì67\\", Wisden 1968, pp. 828‚Äì54. He continued his all-round form for North-Eastern Transvaal in 1967‚Äì68 and Natal in 1968‚Äì69. He took up the position of sports supervisor at the University of Natal in 1968, which combined administrative, coaching and mentoring duties.Trevor Goddard, Caught in the Deep, Vision Media, East London, 1988, pp. 26‚Äì7. His prot√©g√©s at the university included John Traicos and Vintcent van der Bijl. =1969‚Äì70 series= In the first match in the Currie Cup in 1969‚Äì70 he carried his bat for 85 not out for Natal against Western Province. His batting form fell away somewhat in the next few matches but his bowling was as effective as ever, and he was selected for the first three Tests against Australia. He opened the batting with Barry Richards in the first four innings of the series, and although he made only 16, 17, 17 and 6, his opening partnerships with Richards were worth 21, 52, 88 and 56. He took 9 wickets at 22.55, conceding only 203 runs from 126.3 overs, and taking the final three wickets of the Third Test to ensure South Africa's victory in the series.Wisden 1971, pp. 887‚Äì98. Goddard had already said that it would be his last series. Immediately after the Third Test ended, while the players were celebrating in the dressing room, one of the selectors told Goddard he had been left out of the team for the final Test now that the series was won, so that the team should consist only of players who would be touring England later that year. The decision and its timing were widely unpopular. Peter Pollock said \\"it was no way to say thanks to a man who had been involved almost from the start in South Africa's rise to cricketing glory\\".Peter Pollock, The Thirty Tests, Don Nelson, Cape Town, 1978, p. 129. Trevor Chesterfield described it as \\"cruel and unnecessary; an act which took some of the sparkle out of the 4‚Äì0 whitewash\\".J. McGlew & T. Chesterfield, South Africa's Cricket Captains, Southern, Halfway House, 1996, p. 114. The captain, Ali Bacher, said that despite the team's success, the day was \\"one of the saddest since I first played Test cricket for South Africa\\".Eric Litchfield, Cricket Grand-Slam, Howard Timmins, Cape Town, 1970, p. 145. Goddard himself simply said, \\"I wouldn't be human if I did not say I was disappointed. But that's life.\\"Litchfield, p. 146. He ended his first-class career a month later by leading Natal to victory against Rhodesia in Salisbury, and taking a hat- trick.Rhodesia v Natal, 1969‚Äì70. After cricket In Caught in the Deep, Goddard's memoir of his life after cricket, he wrote: \\"As the clouds of controversy following my exclusion from the Springbok team began to lift, it gradually began to dawn on me that as far as reality and true fulfilment was concerned I had almost certainly been on the wrong track.\\"Goddard, p. 24. \\"I had always tried to live by certain standards which I had presumed were acceptable to God,\\" he wrote, but he now believed he had been self-righteous in this presumption and, he wrote, \\"I was looking towards God and seeing Him raise His finger. In God's judgement I was undeniably out.\\"Goddard, p. 36-37. He and his wife began to pursue a more intense kind of Christian belief.Goddard, p. 32-39. Jean died of cancer in 1975.Goddard, p. 54. He resigned from his position at the University of Natal in 1977Goddard, p. 62. and took up lay preaching and missionary work. He conducted many missions in secondary schools. In 1978 he married a widow, Lesley.Goddard, p. 67. In December 1985, while driving alone near Graaff-Reinet, he fell asleep at the wheel and his car left the road and crashed; he sustained multiple injuries and spent weeks in hospital, but eventually recovered fully.Goddard, pp. 79‚Äì86. In his final years he lived with his daughter on her farm in Free State. He died on 25 November 2016 at the age of 85 after a long illness. Sources * Goddard, T.

He later served as a Revolutionary in the Communist International (Comintern) in Moscow, before being cashiered in 1929. Later an official in the Soviet government, Pepper ran afoul of the secret police and was executed during the Great Terror of 1937‚Äì38. Biography =Early years= J√≥zsef Pog√°ny was born J√≥zsef Schwartz in Budapest in the Hungary. He was the first of three children. His family were ethnic Jews, but he himself adopted the Hungarian name Pog√°ny to de-emphasize his Jewish origins. His father, Vilmos Schwarz, was a tradesman who became a minor civil servant; he also served Chevra Kadisa synagogue in Pest. His mother Hermina Weinberger was a hairdresser. He was not related to artist Willy Pogany, as was once claimed by Whittaker Chambers. =Hungary= Pog√°ny studied at the University of Budapest (1904-1908); he spent his last six months of studies in Berlin and Paris. He wrote his dissertation on J√°nos Arany. N√©pszava, the Hungarian socialist newspaper for which J√≥zsef Pog√°ny wrote during World War I.He worked as a high school teacher and journalist in Hungary prior to the revolution of 1918‚Äì1919. He wrote for the official organ of the Hungarian Social Democratic Party, N√©pszava (People's Voice), and was a war correspondent during the years of World War I. Despite lack of military credentials aside from war reportage, at the time of the collapse of the Austro-Hungarian empire in 1918, Pog√°ny found himself as the leader of the Budapest Soldiers' Soviet. While Pog√°ny dedicated himself to promotion of what one historian has called \\"the often impossible demands of the soldiers,\\" he nonetheless remained for a time supportive of the policies of the left-wing government of Count Mih√°ly K√°rolyi. On 13 November 1918, Gyula K√°rolyi's new minister of defense, Albert Bartha, decided to take on the Budapest Soldiers' Soviet head on in an attempt to bolster the sagging discipline of the army. Bartha declared that he would \\"no longer tolerate Soldiers' Councils,\\" a position which greatly agitated the newly empowered soldiers. On 4 December he was forced to retreat from this position, however, when the disciplinary power of the officers was transferred to new popularly elected military tribunals.Vermes, \\"The October Revolution in Hungary,\\" pg. 45. Bartha attempted to dodge this decision with the establishment of new disciplinary \\"flying squads,\\" but this move was regarded as counterrevolutionary and Bartha was forced to resign on 11 December. Before this resignation was publicized, Pog√°ny, acting without the endorsement of the Social Democratic Party, led a soldiers' demonstration on the Ministry of Defense demanding Bartha's dismissal. The formal announcement of the resignation on 12 December made it appear to have been the direct result of the street action, further bolstering the status of the Budapest Soldiers' Soviet at the expense of the authority of the officers corps. At the time of the March 1919 uprising which proclaimed a Hungarian Soviet Republic with B√©la Kun as de facto leader, Pog√°ny cast his lot decisively with the revolution. The Communist Party of Hungary (KMP) first merged with radical members of the Social Democratic Party to form a single organization. Pog√°ny was one of five party leaders signing the unity document on behalf of the Left Socialists. While the two parties were formally ratifying the agreement, Pog√°ny's Soldiers' Soviet assumed control of the Budapest police, occupied the collector jail, and dispatched armed bands throughout the capital to intimidate political opponents.Bennett Kovrig, Communism in Hungary: From Kun to K√°d√°r. Stanford, CA: Hoover Institution Press, 1979; pg. 39. A Revolutionary Governing Council was established on 21 March 1919, with Pog√°ny named People's Commissar of War.Kovrig, Communism in Hungary, pg. 40. The first two decrees of the Revolutionary Governing Council instituted the death penalty for armed resistance to the new regime and a total prohibition of alcohol consumption in Hungary. The next day, newspapers appeared carrying the proclamation drafted by Kun and Pog√°ny proclaiming the establishment of a Hungarian Soviet Republic. J√≥zsef Pog√°ny speaks during the Hungarian Revolution of 1919.One of Pog√°ny's first acts as People's Commissar of War was to summarily dismiss all \\"non-proletarian elements from the Hungarian military and to abolish conscription. It was hoped that a new recruitment campaign targeted at wage-workers and landless peasants would make up the losses, resulting in a homogeneous and loyal military organization. This policy, begun by Pog√°ny and continued by his successor, proved to be a total failure, however, as only about 5,000 qualified individuals chose to enlist in the Hungarian Red Army after an intensive three week campaign. The former Communists did not trust the former Left-Socialists now enlisted as party allies, however. Pog√°ny clashed pointedly with a number of hardline Communist Party radicals, including Tibor Szamuely and B√©la V√°g√≥.Kovrig, Communism in Hungary, pg. 52. On 2 April, Pog√°ny was shifted to the less sensitive position of deputy People's Commissar of Foreign Affairs, while Szamuely was transferred to the People's Commissariat of Culture, where he assumed responsibility for the revolutionary government's military recruitment campaign. Pepper was shortly moved again to the position of People's Commissar of Education, a position which he retained until the fall of the revolutionary government on 1 August 1919. Despite his removal as head of the People's Commissariat of War, Pog√°ny remained a member of governing Revolutionary National Council, in which he seems to have maintained an ultra-radical position against a negotiated truce with Romania and in favor of an all-or- nothing gamble on the policy of uncompromising revolutionary war ‚Äî a position roughly analogous to that espoused in 1918 by the \\"Left Communists\\" in Soviet Russia.On 13 April 1919, Pog√°ny declared that \\"[revolutionary war] is the only possible way to liberate the Hungarian proletarian masses from the hated rule of foreign capitalists and boyars.\\" See: Eva S. Balogh, \\"Nationality Problems of the Hungarian Soviet Republic,\\" in Iv√°n V√∂lgyes (ed.), Hungary in Revolution, 1918‚Äì19: Nine Essays. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 1971; pg. 96. Pog√°ny also joined Tibor Szamuely as an adherent of \\"Red Terror\\" ‚Äî proposing that the Soviet government take as hostages 200 prominent citizens as a means of forcing an end to counter-revolutionary resistance.Gy√∂rgy Bors√°nyi, The Life of a Communist Revolutionry, B√©la Kun. Mario D. Fenyo, trans. Boulder, CO: Social Science Monographs/Atlantic Research and Publications, 1993; pg. 165. Although himself of mixed mind on the issue, Kun signed on to the plan. The hostages, many of them elderly and of no significant threat to the regime, were taken before ultimately being liberated as a goodwill gesture in an effort to bring about a negotiated settlement. Pog√°ny's leading position in the Soviet government made him a target for anti- communist forces. When the Red government was overthrown by Admiral Horthy and his allies, Pog√°ny fled to Austria and later to Soviet Russia to avoid being killed in the reprisals known as the \\"White Terror.\\" Pog√°ny was accused by the new regime of complicity in the murder of former Hungarian Prime Minister Count Istv√°n Tisza by a group of soldiers during the Chrysanthemum Revolution of October 1918. He was tried in absentia and convicted along with five others in October 1921, but never extradited for enforcement of the sentence. =Germany= In March 1921, Pog√°ny was sent to Germany along with B√©la Kun to help organize a revolutionary uprising there with the Communist Party of Germany. According to scholar Thomas L. Sakmyster: > Despite the pressure from Moscow on the GCP leadership, Kun and Pog√°ny > encountered stiff resistance to their plans from the more moderate faction > of the GCP leadership, especially from Klara Zetkin and Paul Levi. They > regarded the Comintern agents as obnoxious and unscrupulous outsiders who > knew little about conditions in Germany and were proposing a highly > unrealistic and potentially disastrous policy... The message either did not > reach Pog√°ny or he chose to ignore it, for the action proceeded in Hamburg > as planned... The plan to spark a major revolution had failed.. Pog√°ny... > made his way back to Berlin. Following the defeat of this so-called \\"March Action,\\" Pog√°ny and Kun returned to Moscow, where they attended the 3rd World Congress of the Comintern from 22 June to 12 July. =United States= Along with other √©migr√© Hungarian radicals in Soviet Russia, Pog√°ny was set to work in the apparatus of the Communist International (Comintern), which was at the time attempting to foment general socialist revolution across Europe. The Hungarian Communists in exile were bitterly divided along factional lines. Pog√°ny, as a member of the governing Central Committee of the Hungarian Communist Party, was closely allied to B√©la Kun in the factional turmoil which ensued. The Comintern disapproved of the disorganizing impact of this intra-party war among the Hungarian Communists and ordered the feuding groups to disband in January 1922. Pog√°ny was dispatched by the Comintern to the United States in July 1922 to assist with the Hungarian Federation of the Communist Party of America (CPA).Theodore Draper, The Roots of American Communism. New York: Viking, 1957; pg. 364. Upon arrival Pog√°ny adopted a new Americanized name as his own, \\"John Pepper\\" ‚Äî the name by which he was known for the rest of his life ‚Äî and immediately set about learning the English language. Along with the Comintern's official representative to the CPA, Genrik Valetski, and its representative to the Communist Party's trade union movement, Boris Reinstein, Pepper attended the ill-fated August 1922 convention of the CPA, held in Bridgman, Michigan, narrowly escaping from the clutches of the police who raided the gathering. Future factional ally Benjamin Gitlow later recalled the initial impression which Pepper made upon him when he first met him at the Bridgman convention: > The second of the three Comintern nuncios looked like a Hungarian version of > the proverbial traveling salesman. Short and stocky, with a large head and a > disproportionately larger nose that proudly bore a pair of gold-rimmed > spectacles perched importantly on its bridge, he dressed like a dude, combed > his hair sleek and neat, was always clean-shaven, smoked gold-tipped > cigarettes, listened attentively to everything that was being said in his > presence, and said absolutely nothing.... In Hungary his name had been Josef > Pog√°ny; he came to America as John Pepper. Making use of his European erudition, storied past as a revolutionary leader, and personal magnetism, Pepper soon emerged as one of the CPA's most authoritative voices. Pepper wrote extensively on international developments and domestic policy questions for the party press, becoming the American Communist movement's most forceful advocates for abandonment of \\"underground\\" isolation and adoption of the strategy of constructing a mass Labor Party in America. Pepper aligned with Jay Lovestone's pro-Bukharin faction, as Whittaker Chambers recalled in his memoirs: > For the first and only time, I attended a Lovestone caucus meeting... I > remember the short, arrogant figure of John Pepper, who, as Joseph Pogany, > had been the commissar for war in the Hungarian Soviet Government, and who > was now the official representative of the Communist International to the > American Communist Party, and Lovestone's \\"gray eminence.\\" A factional foe, James P. Cannon, later recalled the decisive role which Pepper played in the American Communist movement of the 1920s: > He first came to this country in the summer of 1922 and soon began to > regulate party affairs with the arbitrary authority of a receiver appointed > by the court to take over a bankrupt concern. His only trouble was that this > particular concern was by no means bankrupt, and the receiver's operations > met with challenge and opposition which limited his tenure to a rather short > term. But while it lasted it was a real merry-go-round which left everybody > dizzy.  > > We were [later] told in Moscow that he had been shipped to America in one > of the moves to break up the raging faction fight in the √©migr√© leadership > of the defeated Hungarian Communist Party, and that his assignment was to > work with the Bureau of the Hungarian Federation of the party in the U.S. > > As far as I know, that's all the official authorization he ever had. But > Pepper, a manipulator deluxe, was never one to be stopped by the formal > rules and regulations which act as restraints on ordinary mortals. The man > worked fast. Pepper was made a member of the governing Central Executive Committee of the CPA's \\"above-ground\\" arm, the Workers Party of America, a position to which he was re-elected by the 3rd Convention in January 1924. Pepper allied himself closely with the Executive Secretary of the CPA's \\"legal\\" wing, C.E. Ruthenberg, and together the two headed one of the two primary factions in the American Communist Party throughout the second half of the 1920s. Not surprisingly, Pepper was loathed by the opposition faction headed by William Z. Foster and James P. Cannon, who managed to have Pepper recalled to Moscow by the Comintern in 1925. =Soviet Union= Once back in Moscow, Pepper headed the Information Department of the Comintern, while continuing to play a role in a factional war that swept the American Communist Party by supporting the various positions of the Ruthenberg-Lovestone faction which came before the Executive Committee of the Communist International (ECCI). An acute factionalist, Pepper was early to attempt to bolster the standing of his American allies in Moscow by agitating against Leon Trotsky and accusing the Foster group of softness towards the discredited Soviet leader. Pepper was a delegate of the Communist Party of America to the 5th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, convened in March 1925, to which he delivered the report of the Information Department on 6 April 1925. At the 6th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, held in February and March 1926, Pepper was made an alternate member of the Presidium of ECCI and returned to the political commission of that body. At the 7th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI, held in November and December 1926, Pepper was named a member of the political commission, where he was instrumental in helping to remove his nemesis Grigory Zinoviev from the Comintern Presidency. In July 1927 Pepper was elected to the Presidium of ECCI. Pepper fell from favor in 1928 as Joseph Stalin and Nikolai Bukharin parted company in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, with Pepper's political views coming under criticism at both the 9th Enlarged Plenum of ECCI and the 6th World Congress of the Comintern. In 1929, Stalin repeated accusations against him at the ECCI Presidium and in May 1929 the Comintern sent an open letter to the American Communist Party relaying the news that the \\"Pepper case\\" would shortly be submitted to the disciplinary International Control Commission (ICC) of the Comintern The ICC returned its verdict in September 1929, confirming the accusations made against Pepper and removing him from all functions in the Communist International. Following his dismissal from the Comintern, Pepper went to work in the Soviet government. At the time of his 1937 arrest, Pepper was serving as the head of the publicity department of the People's Commissariat of the Food Industry.\\"Dzhon Vil'gel'movich Peper-Pogan',\\" in L. I.

Following extensive interrogation, he was convicted of \\"participation in a counter-revolutionary organization\\" in a summary trial on 8 February 1938, and executed that same day.

After retiring from playing, he was prominent in cricket administration, and served as chairman of the England selectors and as President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). Life and career Insole was born in Clapton, London, attended the Monoux School, Walthamstow, and lived most of his adult life at Chingford. He was cricket captain of Cambridge University whilst a history student at St Catharine's College and went on to captain Essex for many years. He scored 20,113 first-class runs for Essex, the ninth highest aggregate for the club. He played as a wicket-keeper, batsmen, and as a bowler. He was one of the Wisden Cricketers of the Year in 1956. He was President of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) for the twelve months, beginning on 1 October 2006. For his many services to cricket, Insole was appointed a CBE in 1979. Insole was chairman of selectors for England in the 1960s, and in 1968, he was criticized for presiding over the non-selection of Basil D'Oliveira for a tour to South Africa. Only later did it become generally known that the selectors had been pressurised into omitting D'Oliveira because he was a 'coloured' South African and his inclusion in a team to visit the country, then under apartheid, was thought to be undiplomatic. Also during Insole's time Geoffrey Boycott was dropped, in 1967 after having scored 246 not out. Boycott admitted to still feeling aggrieved about this over 40 years later, while commenting on the third Test between New Zealand and England at Napier on 24 March 2008 and again during the Test Match Special commentary of England against the West Indies at Edgbaston on 7 June 2012, where he said that Insole \\"should have spelt his name with an A!\\" Again on 9 August 2014 during the 4th Test against India at Old Trafford, Insole's name was mentioned and Boycott was off on his tirade and reiterated his thoughts on how Insole's name should be spelt and was quickly silenced by Jonathan Agnew.TMS Insole was a first team footballer for the amateur Corinthian-Casuals F.C., and played in the 1956 FA Amateur Cup final, before they lost to Bishop Auckland in a replay. He managed the 1978-79 by David Liverman and 1982-83 Ashes tours to Australia, and for nine years to 2006 was chair of the European Cricket Council. Insole died on 5 August 2017, aged 91. His death was announced by Essex County Cricket Club the following day.

Terraces were common in baseball in the early days, and were typically used to make up the difference in grade level between the edge of the outfield and a nearby street, which might vary from a few feet to a very significant slope. Many of these features were eventually covered when interior bleachers were built, but in some cases that was not possible, and the terrace remained for the life of the ballpark. This feature is to be distinguished from the normal gradual \\"turtleback\\" grading that is or was sometimes done in baseball and football fields in order to facilitate drainage. *Baker Bowl in Philadelphia. :Had a gradual rise in center field necessitated by a railroad tunnel emanating from the station on the other side of Broad Street.

The most famous major league ballpark with a terrace. Like most terraces, its purpose was to make up the difference in grade level between the field and the streets. The outfield area was too small to cover with bleachers, and excavation to level the area was never undertaken.

The name of the music is not an accurate description because Guangdong music is not the only music of the whole Guangdong area. Cantonese classical music especially were usually much livelier in pace and happier than those of other China provinces which is typical and the very essence of the Cantonese's character. In Guangdong, there are numerous traditional genres of music such as Teochew music and Hakka music (Hakka Hanyue and sixian). The name of the music originated in the 1920 and 1930s when the music was popular in Shanghai ballrooms in the form of \\"Spiritual Music\\" (Á≤æÁ•ûÈü≥Ê®Ç, Jƒ´ngshƒõn Yƒ´nyu√®; more properly translated as \\"spirited music\\"). As the performers were almost entirely from Guangdong, Shanghai people generalized the form of music as Guangdong music. Musically, compositions are based on tunes derived from Cantonese opera, together with new compositions from the 1920s onwards. Some pieces have influences from jazz and Western music, using syncopation and triple time, and incorporating instruments such as the saxophone, violin, guitar, piano, drum set, or xylophone.Leisure and Cultural Service Department (Hong Kong) - Guangdong music series Instrumentation The gaohu is the most common lead instrument used in performing Cantonese music. It was invented by L√º Wencheng (ÂêïÊñáÊàê, 1898-1981) in the 1920s. Prior to this, the erxian was the most common lead bowed string instrument in the Cantonese ensemble. Ensembles led by the erxian and also featuring the tiqin are called yinggong (Á°¨Âºì, literally \\"hard bow\\") ensembles, while those led by the gaohu are called ruangong (ËΩØÂºì, literally \\"soft bow\\") because the erxian and tiqin have thick bamboo bows, while the gaohu has a thinner, flexible bow. Guangdong music gradually evolved into a string ensemble format by the 1960s, led by the gaohu with ruan, qinqin, yangqin, sanxian, yehu, tiqin and various woodwind (including houguan) and percussion instruments. Alto saxophone, xylophone, violin, piano, electric guitar, and drum set may also be used, in combination with traditional instruments.

After the war the club joined the Luton & District League for the 1946‚Äì47 season, where they played until joining Division Two of the South Midlands League in 1954. They won Division Two at the first attempt, earning promotion to Division One. The following season saw them finish as runners-up in Division One, resulting in promotion to the Premier Division. In 1962‚Äì63 the club finished bottom of the division and were relegated back to Division One. However, they returned to the Premier Division two seasons later after winning the Division One title in 1964‚Äì65. This saw the start of a decade-long spell of success for Barton Rovers; their first five seasons back in the Premier Division saw them finish third on four occasions and runners-up once. They then went on to win three successive titles between 1970‚Äì71 and 1972‚Äì73, and after a third-place finish in 1973‚Äì74, they won five consecutive titles.

He is considered a pioneer in the field of ecological and evolutionary genetics of plants.C. Stacy French (1989) Biographical Memoirs (National Academy of Sciences, Volume 58, pages 75-89) Clausen's Masters and Ph.D. work studied hybrids formed between Viola arvensis and Viola tricolor. Biography Clausen was born in Nr. Eskilstrup, Soderup parish on the island of Zealand, Denmark. He was the son of Christen Augustinus Clausen (1858-1938) and Christine (Christensen) Clausen (1856-1933). His parents were farmers and at age 14 he took responsibility for the family farm and was largely educated at home with the assistance of a local school teacher. He studied Mendel's genetics and Darwinian evolutionary theory. In 1913 he entered the University of Copenhagen, where he studied botany, genetics and ecology. Christen Raunki√¶r suggested he undertake graduate studies and Clausen chose to study the genetics and ecology of the plant family Violaceae. He studied hybridization patterns across a range of environments and described introgression of genes between species. He completed his master's degree in 1920 and was appointed assistant professor to geneticist √òjvind Winge at the Royal Veterinary and Agricultural University in Copenhagen. In 1926, Clausen was awarded his Ph.D. for his work on Violaceae; his monograph was one of the first publications that combined systematics, ecology and genetics for any plant group. During 1927-1928, Clausen received a Rockefeller scholarship to study at the University of California, Berkeley where he worked on the genetics of the genus Crepis with E. B. Babcock. During this time he met Californian botanist Harvey Monroe Hall, who invited Clausen to return to the United States to work on the ecological genetics of Californian native species. Clausen returned to the California in 1931 as a staff member at the Carnegie Institution of Washington Department of Plant Biology at Stanford, California. He would become a naturalized citizen of the United States during 1943. With taxonomist David D. Keck and physiologist William Hiesey, he formed the first interdisciplinary effort to combine genetics, ecology and systematics in order to understand the ecological genetics of the evolutionary process in California plants. The project lasted 20 years during which they performed some of the classic experiments in plant ecology in which they looked at species formation across Altitudinal zonation using experimental plots at Stanford (near sea level), at Mather in Sacramento County (at about 4,600 feet), and at Timberline in the Sierra Nevada (at about 10,000 feet). Works Collectively Clausen, Keck and Hiesey wrote five books on their work, including Experimental Studies on the Nature of Species. I. Effect of Varied Environments on Western North American Plants published in 1940 and Experimental Studies on the Nature of Species. III. Environmental Responses of Climatic Races of Achillea in 1948. Clausen produced one additional book about his work based on the Messenger Lectures he gave at Cornell which was published in 1951 as Stages in the Evolution of Plant Species. Honors Clausen was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences; he was also a member of the Botanical Society of America, and the Society for the Study of Evolution. He was a fellow of the California Academy of Sciences and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. He was knighted in the Order of the Danneborg by Frederick IX of Denmark. Clausen was a member of the First Baptist Church of Palo Alto, California. References Other sources *Smocovitis, V. B.

The objective of this policy was to confine the effects of the conflict to Northern Ireland.David McKittrick & David McVea, Making Sense of the Troubles, Penguin Books 2001, , pg.123 / 171Liz Curtis, Ireland: The Propaganda War, The British Media and the Battle for the Hearts and Minds, Pluto Press 1984, , pg.68‚Äì69Richard Bourke, Peace in Ireland: The War of Ideas, Pimlico 2003, , pg.164 Name and origin The name of the policy comes from a similar US strategy towards the end of the Vietnam War called \\"Vietnamization\\". Vietnamization was a policy to increase the proportion of South Vietnamese forces fighting in the conflict, while reducing that of the American military. It was a response to the Vietnam Syndrome of American public opinion turning against American military involvement in Vietnam. By analogy, British policymakers perceived the death of soldiers from Mainland Britain (i.e. England, Scotland, and Wales) during The Troubles to be far more consequential in terms of British public opinion than what could be portrayed as \\"Irish people killing and policing Irish people\\".Neumann, Peter R. \\"The myth of Ulsterization in British security policy in Northern Ireland.\\" Studies in Conflict and Terrorism 26.5 (2003): 365‚Äì377. The move to locally based policing followed the Hunt Report, published on 3 October 1969. This recommended a complete reorganisation of the Royal Ulster Constabulary, with the aim of both modernising the force and bringing it into line with the other police forces in the UK. In 1970, Lord Carrington also warned that British Army expenditures in Northern Ireland were unacceptably high; throughout the 1970s, military leadership stressed the need to focus on confronting the Red Army on the North German Plain, rather than on fighting in Northern Ireland. The Ulsterisation plan was outlined in an unpublished 1975 British strategy paper titled The Way Ahead produced by a committee of senior British Army, RUC and MI5 officers, chaired by John Bourn, a Northern Ireland Office civil servant.Mark Urban, Big Boys' Rules: The Secret Struggle against the IRA, Faber and Faber 1992, , pg.17 Implementation Ulsterisation included various attempts to reform views of the RUC, whose reputation had suffered from its involvement in the 1969 Northern Ireland riots, which was seen as biased by Northern Ireland civil rights movement campaigners. Under Labour's first Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Merlyn Rees, increases in the proportion of police and army recruits from Northern Ireland into the UDR continued until the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1988. Rees' aim was to put security policy on a more logical and rational basis, and along with the Chief Constable of the RUC, Englishman Kenneth NewmanNewman had started his career in the Palestine Police, and would be given the job of implementing Police Primacy in 1976, Mark Urban, pg.18 they produced the often controversial strategies of \\"criminalisation\\" and Ulsterisation.David McKittrick & David McVea, Making Sense of the Troubles, Penguin Books 2001, , pg.123 These policies would later be extended by Roy Mason, and would include the use of the Special Air Service on the Irish border.Alan F. Parkinson, Ulster Loyalism and the British Media, Four Courts Press1998, , pg.47 Result Ulsterisation brought about striking changes in the casualty patterns, with military/police casualties from Northern Ireland exceeding those from Britain for the rest of the conflict, reversing the previous pattern. A related strategy, 'Criminalisation', was meant to avoid any acknowledgement of the political motivation and nature of the conflict and was partly motivated to change perceptions of the conflict from a colonial war to that of a campaign against criminal gangs.Liz Curtis, Ireland: The Propaganda War, The British Media and the Battle for the Hearts and Minds, Pluto Press 1984, , pg.51 It was judged that the political impact in Britain of killings of British soldiers by the Provisional Irish Republican Army was greater than the deaths of local security forces members. The drop in the number of non-UDR British Army casualties by 1976 helped prevent any build-up of sentiment in Britain for a withdrawal from Northern Ireland.

The republican prisoners' status as political prisoners, known as Special Category Status, had begun to be phased out in 1976. Among other things, this meant that they would now be required to wear prison uniforms like ordinary convicts. The prisoners refused to accept that they had been administratively designated as ordinary criminals, and refused to wear the prison uniform. Background Maze prison outside of Belfast. Convicted paramilitary prisoners were treated as ordinary criminals until July 1972, when Special Category Status was introduced following a hunger strike by 40 IRA prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category, or political, status meant prisoners were treated very much like prisoners of war, for example, they did not have to wear prison uniforms or do prison work. In 1976, as part of the policy of \\"criminalisation\\", the British Government brought an end to Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted after 1 March 1976. The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow. The imminent withdrawal of Special Category Status caused relations between the prisoners and prison officers to deteriorate, and in early 1976 the IRA leaders in prison sent word to the IRA Army Council asking them to begin assassinating prison officers, stating \\"we are prepared to die for political status. Those who try to take it away from us must be fully prepared to pay the same price\\". Outside the prison the IRA responded by shooting prison officer Patrick Dillon in April 1976, the first of nineteen prison officers to be killed during the five-year protest. The blanket protest began on 14 September 1976 when newly convicted prisoner Kieran Nugent refused to wear prison uniform. Nugent had previously been interned in the compounds of Long Kesh during 1975, but was arrested in May 1976 and received a three- year sentence after being convicted of possessing weapons and hijacking a car. In 1985, Nugent gave an interview describing his arrival at the newly constructed H-Blocks at the prison complex: > I was brought straight to the blocks. Cell 17, D wing H1 or 2. I was > stripped and beaten. The screws who knew me said, 'We are the bosses now. > There are no OCs here'. A screw said to me, 'What size are you in the waist > and what size are you for shoes?' I asked him 'What for?' and he told me > 'For a uniform'. I said, 'You have got to be joking'. I was the only one in > the H-Blocks. They dragged me into the cell. Davy Long [one of the warders] > wanted me to compromise. He suggested I wore my own shoes and trousers if I > wore a prison shirt. I just laughed. He locked the door. I lay on the floor > all night without mattress, blankets or anything else. The heat was > reasonable in all fairness and I slept. Nugent was given a blanket on the second day of his imprisonment, which he wore during an exercise period. Nugent only wore a prison uniform once, when his mother visited the prison. He told her: > You will not be seeing me for three years because to have a visit I have to > wear uniform. If they want me to wear a uniform they'll have to nail it to > my back. Other newly convicted prisoners joined the protest, and at first they were allowed to wear blankets during the exercise period but eventually they were ordered to leave the blankets in their cells. As prison rules required the prisoners to wear prison uniform when leaving their cells, they were confined to their cells for twenty-four hours a day. The prison governor would order the protesting prisoners to wear uniforms every two weeks, and the prisoners refused. As a result of their refusal, they would receive three days \\"on the boards\\" where all furniture was removed from their cell, and they were served the \\"number one diet\\" consisting of tea without milk, watery soup and dry bread. The refusal to comply with prison rules carried a further punishment, the loss of remission which reduced a prisoner's sentence by fifty percent in exchange for good behaviour. Prisoners were entitled to four visits from friends or family each month, three were in exchange for good behaviour and the fourth was statutory. Protesting prisoners automatically forfeited the three \\"privileged\\" visits, and their refusal to wear prison uniform even for visits meant they forfeited the fourth. This left one censored letter in and out of the prison each month as their only contact with the outside world, until after several months some prisoners compromised by agreeing to wear uniforms for visits to maintain contact with the paramilitary leaderships outside the prison. As a result of the IRA's assassination campaign against prison officers, relations between the prisoners and prison officers were tense. In March 1978 some prisoners refused to leave their cells to shower or use the lavatory because of attacks by prison officers, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells. The prisoners requested showers be installed in their cells and when this request was turned down they refused to use the wash-hand basins. Dirty protest and hunger strikes At the end of April 1978 a fight occurred between a prisoner and a prison officer in H-Block 6. The prisoner was taken away to solitary confinement, and news spread across the wing that the prisoner had been badly beaten. The prisoners responded by smashing the furniture in their cells, and the prison authorities responded by removing the remaining furniture from the cells leaving the prisoners in cells with just blankets and mattresses. The prisoners responded by refusing to leave their cells, and as a result the prison officers were unable to clear them. This resulted in the blanket protest escalating into the dirty protest, as the prisoners were unable to \\"slop out\\" (i.e., empty their chamber pots) so resorted to smearing excrement on the walls of their cells. On 27 October 1980, IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon, began a hunger strike aimed at restoring political status for paramilitary prisoners by securing what were known as the \\"Five Demands\\": # The right not to wear a prison uniform; # The right not to do prison work; # The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits; # The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week; # Full restoration of remission lost through the protest. After a 53-day hunger strike with McKenna lapsing in and out of a coma and on the brink of death, the government appeared to concede the essence of the prisoners' five demands with a 30-page document detailing a proposed settlement. With the document in transit to Belfast, Hughes took the decision to save McKenna's life and end the strike after 53 days on 18 December. In January 1981 it became clear that the prisoners' demands had not been conceded. On 4 February the prisoners issued a statement saying that the British government had failed to resolve the crisis and declared their intention of \\"hunger striking once more\\". The 1981 Irish hunger strike began on 1 March when Bobby Sands refused food, and by the time the strike ended on 3 October, ten men, including Sands, had starved to death. Two days later, the incoming Northern Ireland Secretary, James Prior, announced a number of changes in prison policy, including that from then on all paramilitary prisoners would be allowed to wear their own clothes at all times.

According to Garhwali folklore, Pyoli was a young maiden living in the forest. She was raised by animals and her first human contact was in the form of a prince who had lost his way during a hunting expedition. She tended after him and of course he fell in love with her. He persuaded her to marry him and accompany him to his palace. Although she loved the prince she started wilting away in the absence of a natural environment. No one could cure her and finally she died pining for her flora and fauna friends. Her last wish was that she should be buried among her friends. The prince took her to be buried at the place he had first met her. Some time later a pretty, yellow flower came out at the spot. This flower was named after the pretty nature-loving belle.

Background Convicted paramilitary prisoners were treated as ordinary criminals until July 1972, when Special Category Status was introduced following a hunger strike by 40 IRA prisoners led by the veteran republican Billy McKee. Special Category (or political) status meant prisoners were treated very much like prisoners of war, for example, not having to wear prison uniforms or do prison work. In 1976, as part of the policy of \\"criminalisation\\", the British Government brought an end to Special Category Status for paramilitary prisoners in Northern Ireland. The policy was not introduced for existing prisoners, but for those convicted after 1 March 1976. The end to Special Category Status was a serious threat to the authority which the paramilitary leaderships inside prison had been able to exercise over their own men, as well as being a propaganda blow. The imminent withdrawal of Special Category Status caused relations between the prisoners and prison officers to deteriorate, and in early 1976 the IRA leaders in prison sent word to the IRA Army Council asking them to begin assassinating prison officers, stating \\"we are prepared to die for political status. Those who try to take it away from us must be fully prepared to pay the same price\\". Outside the prison the IRA responded by shooting prison officer Patrick Dillon in April 1976, the first of nineteen prison officers to be killed during the five-year protest.The Provisional IRA, p. 351. On 14 September 1976 newly convicted prisoner Kieran Nugent began the blanket protest, in which IRA and INLA prisoners refused to wear prison uniform and either went naked or fashioned garments from prison blankets. Dirty protest In March 1978 some prisoners refused to leave their cells to shower or use the lavatory because of attacks by prison officers, and were provided with wash-hand basins in their cells.Brits by Peter Taylor (), page 229 The prisoners requested showers installed in their cells, and when this request was turned down they refused to use the wash-hand basins. At the end of April 1978 a fight occurred between a prisoner and a prison officer in H-Block 6. The prisoner was taken away to solitary confinement, and news spread across the wing that the prisoner had been badly beaten. The prisoners responded by smashing the furniture in their cells, and the prison authorities responded by removing the remaining furniture from the cells, leaving the prisoners in cells with just blankets and mattresses. The prisoners responded by refusing to leave their cells, and as a result the prison officers were unable to clear them. This resulted in the blanket protest escalating into the dirty protest, as the prisoners could not leave their cells to \\"slop out\\" (i.e., empty their chamber pots), and started smearing excrement on the walls of their cells.The Provisional IRA, pp. 351‚Äì352. Prisoner Pat McGeown described the conditions inside the prison in a 1985 interview: > There were times when you would vomit. There were times when you were so run > down that you would lie for days and not do anything with the maggots > crawling all over you. The rain would be coming in the window and you would > be lying there with the maggots all over the place.The Provisional IRA, p. > 352. The prison authorities attempted to keep the cells clean by breaking the cell windows and spraying in disinfectant, then temporarily removing the prisoners and sending in rubber-suited prison officers with steam hoses to clean the walls. However, as soon as the prisoners were returned to their cells they resumed their protest. By mid-1978 there were between 250 and 300 protesting prisoners, and the protest was attracting media attention from around the world. Tom√°s √ì Fiaich, the Roman Catholic Cardinal Archbishop of Armagh, visited the prison on 31 July 1978 and condemned the conditions there: > Having spent the whole of Sunday in the prison, I was shocked at the inhuman > conditions prevailing in H-Blocks, three, four and five, where over 300 > prisoners were incarcerated. One would hardly allow an animal to remain in > such conditions, let alone a human being. The nearest approach to it that I > have seen was the spectacle of hundreds of homeless people living in the > sewer pipes in the slums of Calcutta. The stench and filth in some of the > cells, with the remains of rotten food and human excreta scattered around > the walls was almost unbearable. In two of them I was unable to speak for > fear of vomiting. Despite the conditions, √ì Fiaich said the morale of the prisoners was high: > From talking to them [he wrote] it is evident that they intend to continue > their protest indefinitely and it seems they prefer to face death rather > than to submit to being classed as criminals. Anyone with the least > knowledge of Irish history knows how deeply this attitude is in our > country's past. In isolation and perpetual boredom they maintain their > sanity by studying Irish. It was an indication of the triumph of the human > spirit over adverse material conditions to notice Irish words, phrases and > songs being shouted from cell to cell and then written on each cell wall > with the remnants of toothpaste tubes.The Provisional IRA, p. 353. The protest continued with no sign of compromise from the British government, and by late 1979 nine out of ten newly arriving prisoners were choosing to join the protest.The Provisional IRA, p. 354. In January 1980 the prisoners issued a statement outlining what were known as the \\"Five Demands\\": # The right not to wear a prison uniform; # The right not to do prison work; # The right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits; # The right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week; # Full restoration of remission lost through the protest.Provos The IRA & Sinn F√©in, pp. 229‚Äì234. In February 1980, Mair√©ad Farrell and over thirty other prisoners in Armagh Women's Prison joined the dirty protest following a series of disputes with the prison governor, including allegations they had been ill-treated by male prison officers. They did not conduct a blanket protest, as women prisoners in Northern Ireland already had the right to wear their own clothes, but this did include smearing their menstrual blood on the cell walls. In June 1980 the British government's position was strengthened when the European Commission of Human Rights rejected a case by four prisoners including Kieran Nugent that conditions inside the prison were \\"inhuman\\". The Commission's ruling was that the conditions were self-inflicted and \\"designed to enlist sympathy for the [prisoners'] political aims'. Hunger strikes On 27 October 1980, IRA members Brendan Hughes, Tommy McKearney, Raymond McCartney, Tom McFeeley, Sean McKenna, Leo Green, and INLA member John Nixon, began a hunger strike aimed at restoring political status for paramilitary prisoners by securing the \\"Five Demands\\".

Biography Wim Gijsen was one of the Netherlands' most successful writers of modern Science Fiction and Fantasy books. Previously he had been known as a writer of prose, poems, children's books and various works on meditation, vegetarianism and yoga, and translated a book on Tarot by Eden Gray. In 1980 he published his first science fiction novel De Eersten Van Rissan (The First Ones of Rissan). One year later the second part of the series was released: De Koningen Van Weleer (The Kings of the Past). He also wrote another science fiction series: Iskander de Dromendief (Iskander the Dream Thief) and Het Huis van de Wolf (The House of the Wolf). Until his death, he continued writing fantasy literature, with the Deirdre-trilogy being his most popular work today. Gijsen repeatedly used a special theme in his books: A distant planet, where humans coming from Earth have settled down centuries ago and have forgotten about their technological past, now live in a culture that resembles Earth's Middle Ages, with only few people who are aware of technology and who do not share the belief in magic and superstition that the human society has adopted. Popular works The Rissan series * 1980: The First Ones of Rissan, OT: De Eersten Van Rissan * 1981: The Kings of the Past, OT: De Koningen Van Weleer In The First Ones of Rissan, the state of Lhissey is being ruled by a caste of priests who divide the inhabitants into five castes that have to obey strict religious rules. The people of Lhissey do not know that the clairvoyant priests are actually using modern technology to spy on them and to control their behaviour. One day Hirdan, the son of a craftsman, meets a stranger and shows him the ancient city, which immediately raises the priests' suspicions. They promise Hirdan to accept him as one the candidates for the highest caste if he can find out what the stranger wants in Lhissey. Hirdan, who realizes that the caste system is a detriment to the people of Lhissey refuses and flees from the city ‚Äì accompanied by the stranger, who turns out to be an archeologist who is interested in the old pyramid in the centre of the city which must have been there long before the first men came to Rissan. The First Ones of Rissan must have built the pyramid and it is his job to find out where they have gone. Things get even more complicated when Hirdan finds out that the mysterious stranger came to Rissan travelling through the stars like the Gods in the ancient myths of his people. The Dream Thief series * 1982: Iskander the Dream Thief, OT: Iskander de Dromendief * 1983: The House of the Wolf, OT: Het Huis van de Wolf Iskander, a mediocre magician, is travelling through the Island Kingdom of Albe and tries to make ends meet by astonishing his superstitious clients with his simple magic tricks. His only real talent is his ability to enter other people's dreams, changing them in the process. A High Priestess turns to him to seek help for the young Prince of Albe, who is constantly tormented by cruel dreams that could eventually cause a war between Albe and the \\"Continent of Taurus\\". Iskander soon realizes that these dreams are not mere nightmares, but they have been sent by a dark force from the distant Western Continent that wants to invade the rich kingdom of Albe. The \\"Wolf\\" then attacks the Holy Island of Vale, the spiritual center of Albe, with his fleet and Iskander has to conquer his own fears to fight his overpowering enemy. Deirdre-Trilogy * 1985: Keerkringen. * 1985: Bidahinne * 1986: Lure Living in a medieval world dominated by men, the young priestess Deirdre soon learns what it means to be an outcast, after she leaves her monastery without seeking permission in order to see her father one last time before his death. Her family rejects her, so she is forced to earn money as a deckhand in the city of Chelle. Due to her advanced education, she is one of only few women who are able to read, write and do number work, so Deirdre manages to establish a successful enterprise consisting of the capital of the many poor women living in the large city. However, some wealthy business men do not approve of the new competitor and start an intrigue that brings Deirdre not only to court, but she is also sentenced to serve as a prostitute in a local temple. After a long time of indignity, she is bought free by a mysterious abbess from a distant desert monastery beyond the Lavender Sea. She explains to Deirdre that she might be the long sought 'Bidahinne', the woman who was mentioned in a prophecy and who will bring freedom between the known world and the distant kingdom of Lure, where powerful women reign, who possess weapons much stronger than any of those known to men. An adventurous journey begins for Deirdre and the delegates of the monastery, beyond the mountains, to a mysterious land that no man of the known world has seen in millennia.

Purposeful introgression is a long-term process; it may take many hybrid generations before the backcrossing occurs. Introgression differs from simple hybridization. Introgression results in a complex mixture of parental genes, while simple hybridization results in a more uniform mixture, which in the first generation will be an even mix of two parental species. Definition Introgression or introgressive hybridization is the incorporation (usually via hybridization and backcrossing) of alleles from one entity (species) into the gene pool of a second, divergent entity (species).Anderson E, 1949. Introgressive hybridization. New York: Wiley & Sons Ancient introgression events can leave traces of extinct species in present‚Äêday genomes, a phenomenon known as ghost introgression.Jente Ottenburghs (2020) Ghost Introgression: Spooky Gene Flow in the Distant Past. BioEssays. https://doi.org/10.1002/bies.202000012 Source of variation Introgression is an important source of genetic variation in natural populations and may contribute to adaptation and even adaptive radiation. It can occur across hybrid zones due to chance, selection or hybrid zone movement. There is evidence that introgression is a ubiquitous phenomenon in plants and animals, including humans, in which it may have introduced the microcephalin D allele. It has been proposed that historically, domestic animals have had a limited number of domestication situations followed by long periods of introgression where they have acquired the genetic material of wild animals in their DNA. Introgressive hybridization has also been shown to be important in the evolution of domesticated crop species, possibly providing genes that help in their expansion into different environments. A genomic study from New York University Abu Dhabi Center for Genomics and Systems Biology showed that domesticated date palm varieties from North Africa show introgressive hybridization of between 5-18% of its genome from the wild Cretan palm Phoenix theophrasti into Middle East date palms P. dactylifera. This process is also similar to the evolution of apples by hybridization of Central Asian apples with the European crabapple. It has also been shown that indica rice arose when Chinese japonica rice arrived in India about ~4,500 years ago and hybridized with an undomesticated proto-indica or wild O. nivara, and transferred key domestication genes from japonica to indica. Examples =Humans= There is strong evidence for the introgression of Neanderthal genes and Denisovan genes into parts of the modern human gene pool (see more at Archaic human admixture with modern humans). =Butterflies= One important example of introgression has been observed in studies of mimicry in the butterfly genus Heliconius. This genus includes 43 species and many races with different color patterns. Congeners exhibiting overlapping distributions show similar color patterns. The subspecies H. melpomene amaryllis and H. melpomene timareta ssp. nov. overlap in distribution. Using the ABBA/BABA test, some researchers have observed that there is about 2% to 5% introgression between the pair of subspecies. Importantly, the introgression is not random. The researchers saw significant introgression in chromosomes 15 and 18, where important mimicry loci are found (loci B/D and N/Yb). They compared both subspecies with H. melpomene agalope, which is a subspecies near H. melpomene amaryllis in entire genome trees. The result of the analysis was that there is no relation between those two species and H. melpomene agalope in the loci B/D and N/Yb. Moreover, they performed the same analysis with two other species with overlapping distributions, H. timareta florencia and H. melpomene agalope. They demonstrated introgression between the two taxa, especially in the loci B/D and N/Yb. Finally, they concluded their experiments with sliding-window phylogenetic analyses, estimating different phylogenetic trees depending on the different regions of the loci. When a locus is important in the color pattern expression, there is a close phylogenetic relationship between the species. When the locus is not important in the color pattern expression, the two species are phylogenetically distant because there is no introgression at such loci. =Wild species= Introgression could be an important conservation problem for wild species through hybridisation, for instance, between wild and domestic catsReview of scientific papers on gene introgression between wild and domestic cats or among wild canids and domestic dogs.Review and link to scientific papers regarding introgression of dog genes into wild canid populations Another important example in iris species from southern Louisiana has been studied by Arnold & Bennett (1993).Arnold, M. L. & Bennett, B. D. (1993). Natural Hybridization in Louisiana irises: genetic variation and ecological determinants. In: Harrison, R. G. ed. (1993). Hybrid Zones and Evolutionary Process, pp. 115‚Äì139. New York: Oxford University Press. Introgression line An introgression line (IL) is a crop species that contains genetic material artificially derived from a wild relative population through repeated backcrossing. An example of a collection of ILs (called an IL-Library) is the use of chromosome segments from Solanum pennellii (a wild variety of tomato) that was introgressed into Solanum lycopersicum (a variety of cultivated tomato). The lines of an IL-library usually cover the complete genome of the donor. Introgression lines allow the study of quantitative trait loci, but also the creation of new varieties by introducing exotic traits.Eshed, Y (1995) An Introgression Line Population of Lycopersicon pennellii in the Cultivated Tomato Enables the Identification and Fine Mapping of Yield- Associated QTL See also * Chimera (genetics) * Genetic engineering * Genetic erosion * Genetic pollution * Transgene * Transgenic plant References Further reading  D√©cobert, O.

Alberto Sughi (October 5, 1928 - March 31, 2012) was an Italian painter. Biography Sughi was born in Cesena, Emilia-Romagna. A self-taught painter, by the end of his formative years he had become one of the greatest Italian artists of his generation. He started painting in the early 1950s, choosing realism in the debate between abstract and figurative art in the immediate post-war period. Even from his early works, however, Sughi‚Äôs paintings have avoided any attempt at social moralising. They depict moments from daily life with no heroes, allowing Enrico Crispolti, in 1956, to define his work as \\"existential realism\\". His artistic expression proceeds, almost always, in thematic cycles, in the manner of film sequences. First of all, there were his so-called \\"green paintings\\", devoted to the relationship between man and nature (1971‚Äì1973), then the Supper cycle (1975‚Äì1976), after that the 20 paintings and fifteen studies of Imagination and Memory of the Family, dating from the early 1980s; the series Evening or reflection started from 1985. His most recent series of large canvases, exhibited in 2000, is entitled Nocturnal. Sughi has taken part in all the most important collective exhibitions of contemporary art, from the International Biennale art exhibition in Venice to the Quadriennale in Rome, as well as various exhibitions that have been held abroad, charting the history of Italian art from the 1970s until today. Italian and foreign museums have held large retrospective exhibitions; among the most significant are the Gallery of Modern Art in Bologna (1977), the Manezh Gallery in Moscow (1978), the Museum of Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, the Fine Arts Museum in Budapest and the National Gallery in Prague (1986), the Civic Modern Art Gallery in Ferrara (1988), the Casa Masaccio in San Giovanni Valdarno (1990), the Assis Chateaubriand Art Gallery in S√£o Paulo in Brazil (1994) and the Civic Museum of San Sepolcro (2003). The artist has taken part in the cycle of exhibitions entitled The search for identity in Cagliari, Palermo and Ascoli Piceno (2003‚Äì2004), the exhibition Evil. Exercises in cruel painting at the Hunting Lodge of Stupinigi, in Turin (2005), and the exhibition \\"Intimate Portraits from Lotto to Pirandello\\", at the Regional Archaeological Museum in Aosta (2005) . In 1994, Alberto Sughi was appointed director of the Ente Quadriennale Nazionale d' Arte in Rome. At the end of 2005 and until 21 January 2006, a large retrospective exhibition of Sughi‚Äôs work was held at the Palazzo della Pilotta in Parma. The exhibition contained 642 works, including paintings, tempera, drawings, and lithographs, made between 1959 and 2004, and owned by the collections of the Centro Studi ed Archivio della Comunicazione (CSAC) at the University of Parma, including the painting Rimmel, made in 2004. In April and May 2006, the modern art gallery in Arezzo held the exhibition il Segno e l'Immagine, consisting of 50 works (all made on paper and then applied to canvas) painted in 2005 and 2006. 2007 has seen two new major Alberto Sughi's solo exhibitions, the first hold in the new rooms of the Biblioteca Malatestiana di Cesena, the second in the Complesso Vittoriano, Rome. In May 2009 Alberto Sughi had a new large retrospective this time in Palazzo Sant'Elia, Palermo, Sicily. The exhibition presented a group of ninety paintings, both from public and private collections. The exhibition catalogue featured a long essay \\"Dove va l'uomo\\" (\\"Where man goes\\") by the exhibition curator Professor Maurizio Calvesi. In September 2009 the same exhibition was shown at the Italian Institute of Culture in London. In 2011 Alberto Sughi's work Un mondo di freddo e di ghiaccio (A world of cold and of ice), Oil on canvas, 140x160cm, 2011, has been selected for the 54th Venice Biennale, Padiglione Italia. The painting (reproduced here below) will be presented to the public at the Italian Pavilion, in Venice, when the Biennale will open on 4 June 2011. Alberto Sughi, Un mondo di freddo e di ghiaccio (2011)  Controversies  In May 2006, news emerged that the prize-winning Japanese artist, Yoshihiko Wada (aged 66) had been accused of plagiarizing the work of Alberto Sughi (aged 77), having produced several pieces of art virtually identical to pieces from Sughi. The story made national news in Japan. Several pieces of art on exhibition which bear striking similarities to Sughi's works had helped Wada win the Education, Science and Technology Minister's Art Encouragement Prize in March. However, in April the Japan Artists Association and Agency for Cultural Affairs received an anonymous tip-off questioning the authenticity of Wada's work sparking an investigation into the allegations of plagiarism. Wada denies the plagiarism claims, and stated that he had known Sughi ever since he studied in Italy in the 1970s, and had received artistic influence from Sughi whilst doing study and design work together with him. Wada claims he had painted with Sughi \\"in collaboration\\" and therefore the paintings are not plagiarised. Wada told the Japanese newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun he had known Sughi for 40 years and they had drawn together and exchanged opinions. He says the paintings were created as an homage to Sughi and that he had made it clear when exhibiting the works. Sughi said he was unaware of the existence of the similar paintings until he was contacted by the Japanese embassy in Italy in early May. According to Sughi, Wada had introduced himself as a great fan of his work and had visited as many as five times taking photos of his works from different angles. Sughi did not know Wada was also an artist and had only thought Wada was a fan of his paintings. Sughi expressed shock at finding out about Wada's works and is considering filing a criminal complaint and damage suit against Wada for plagiarism. Sughi claims that over 30 of Wada's paintings bore an uncanny resemblance to his work and had suggested that the best way to clarify the truth would be to hold an exhibition of his work alongside Wada's. He also expressed that the award Wada had received should be rescinded. Three of the seven screening judges that decided to award Wada with the art recommendation prize attended a special review meeting. The panel examined the investigation reports, statements, and pictoral records from Wada and Sughi, with a focus on Wada's \\"Drama and Poesie\\" memoir exhibition, which was the basis for his prize. They concluded that there was insufficient evidence to assume Wada's works were not stolen. The Agency for Cultural Affairs also concluded that several of Wada's works appeared to be plagiarised and decided on Monday (June 5) to strip Wada of the prize he won. This would be the first time since the award was set up in 1950 that an artist was stripped of the award.

The first practical transmissions of moving images over a radio system used mechanical rotating perforated disks to scan a scene into a time-varying signal that could be reconstructed at a receiver back into an approximation of the original image. Development of television was interrupted by the Second World War. After the end of the war, all-electronic methods of scanning and displaying images became standard. Several different standards for addition of color to transmitted images were developed, with different regions using technically incompatible signal standards. Television broadcasting expanded rapidly after World War II, becoming an important mass medium for advertising, propaganda, and entertainment. Television broadcasts can be distributed over the air by VHF and UHF radio signals from terrestrial transmitting stations, by microwave signals from Earth orbiting satellites, or by wired transmission to individual consumers by cable TV. Many countries have moved away from the original analog radio transmission methods and now use digital television standards, providing additional operating features and conserving radio spectrum bandwidth for more profitable uses. Television programming can also be distributed over the Internet. Television broadcasting may be funded by advertising revenue, by private or governmental organizations prepared to underwrite the cost, or in some countries, by television license fees paid by owners of receivers. Some services, especially carried by cable or satellite, are paid by subscriptions. Television broadcasting is supported by continuing technical developments such as long-haul microwave networks, which allow distribution of programming over a wide geographic area. Video recording methods allow programming to be edited and replayed for later use. Three-dimensional television has been used commercially but has not received wide consumer acceptance owing to the limitations of display methods. Mechanical television Facsimile transmission systems pioneered methods of mechanically scanning graphics in the early 19th century. The Scottish inventor Alexander Bain introduced the facsimile machine between 1843 and 1846. The English physicist Frederick Bakewell demonstrated a working laboratory version in 1851. The first practical facsimile system, working on telegraph lines, was developed and put into service by the Italian priest Giovanni Caselli from 1856 onward.Huurdeman, p. 149 The first telefax machine to be used in practical operation was invented by an Italian priest and professor of physics, Giovanni Caselli (1815‚Äì1891).Beyer, p. 100 The telegraph was the hot new technology of the moment, and Caselli wondered if it was possible to send pictures over telegraph wires. He went to work in 1855, and over the course of six years perfected what he called the \\"pantelegraph.\\" It was the world's first practical fax machine. Willoughby Smith, an English electrical engineer, discovered the photoconductivity of the element selenium in 1873. This led, among other technologies, towards telephotography, a way to send still images through phone lines, as early as in 1895, as well as any kind of electronical image scanning devices, both still and in motion, and ultimately to TV cameras. The Nipkow disk. This schematic shows the circular paths traced by the holes, which may also be square for greater precision. The area of the disk outlined in black shows the region scanned. As a 23-year-old German university student, Paul Julius Gottlieb Nipkow proposed and patented the Nipkow disk in 1884.Shiers, George and May (1997), Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940. Taylor & Francis, pp. 13, 22. . This was a spinning disk with a spiral pattern of holes in it, so each hole scanned a line of the image. Although he never built a working model of the system, variations of Nipkow's spinning-disk \\"image rasterizer\\" became exceedingly common.Shiers & Shiers, p. 13, 22. Constantin Perskyi had coined the word television in a paper read to the International Electricity Congress at the International World Fair in Paris on August 24, 1900. Perskyi's paper reviewed the existing electromechanical technologies, mentioning the work of Nipkow and others.\\"T√©l√©vision au moyen de l'√©lectricit√©\\", Congr√®s Inographs by Telegraph\\", The New York Times, Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7. However, it was not until 1907 that developments in amplification tube technology, by Lee de Forest and Arthur Korn among others, made the design practical.\\"Sending Photographs by Telegraph\\", The New York Times, Sunday Magazine, September 20, 1907, p. 7. The first demonstration of the instantaneous transmission of images was by Georges Rignoux and A. Fournier in Paris in 1909. A matrix of 64 selenium cells, individually wired to a mechanical commutator, served as an electronic retina. In the receiver, a type of Kerr cell modulated the light and a series of variously angled mirrors attached to the edge of a rotating disc scanned the modulated beam onto the display screen. A separate circuit regulated synchronization. The 8x8 pixel resolution in this proof-of-concept demonstration was just sufficient to clearly transmit individual letters of the alphabet. An updated image was transmitted \\"several times\\" each second.Henry de Varigny, \\"La vision √† distance \\", L'Illustration, Paris, December 11, 1909, p. 451. In 1911, Boris Rosing and his student Vladimir Zworykin created a system that used a mechanical mirror-drum scanner to transmit, in Zworykin's words, \\"very crude images\\" over wires to the \\"Braun tube\\" (cathode ray tube or \\"CRT\\") in the receiver. Moving images were not possible because, in the scanner, \\"the sensitivity was not enough and the selenium cell was very laggy\\".R. W. Burns, Television: An International History of the Formative Years, IET, 1998, p. 119. . Baird in 1925 with his televisor equipment and dummies \\"James\\" and \\"Stooky Bill\\" (right). By the 1920s, when amplification made television practical, Scottish inventor John Logie Baird employed the Nipkow disk in his prototype video systems. He created his prototype in a little village called Santa Cruz on the island of Trinidad where he was recovering from an illness. He also started work on the first color television. On March 25, 1925, Baird gave the first public demonstration of televised silhouette images in motion, at Selfridge's Department Store in London. Since human faces had inadequate contrast to show up on his primitive system, he televised a talking, moving ventriloquist's dummy named \\"Stooky Bill\\", whose painted face had higher contrast. By January 26, 1926, he demonstrated the transmission of image of a face in motion by radio. This is widely regarded as being the world's first public television demonstration. Baird's system used the Nipkow disk for both scanning the image and displaying it. A brightly illuminated subject was placed in front of a spinning Nipkow disk set with lenses which swept images across a static photocell. The thallium sulphide (Thalofide) cell, developed by Theodore Case in the US, detected the light reflected from the subject and converted it into a proportional electrical signal. This was transmitted by AM radio waves to a receiver unit, where the video signal was applied to a neon light behind a second Nipkow disk rotating synchronized with the first. The brightness of the neon lamp was varied in proportion to the brightness of each spot on the image. As each hole in the disk passed by, one scan line of the image was reproduced. Baird's disk had 30 holes, producing an image with only 30 scan lines, just enough to recognize a human face. In 1927, Baird transmitted a signal over of telephone line between London and Glasgow. In 1928, Baird's company (Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television) broadcast the first transatlantic television signal, between London and New York, and the first shore-to-ship transmission. In 1929, he became involved in the first experimental mechanical television service in Germany. In November of the same year, Baird and Bernard Natan of Path√© established France's first television company, T√©l√©vision-Baird-Natan. In 1931, he made the first outdoor remote broadcast, of The Derby.J. L. Baird, \\"Television in 1932\\", BBC Annual Report, 1933. In 1932, he demonstrated ultra-short wave television. Baird's mechanical system reached a peak of 240 lines of resolution on BBC television broadcasts in 1936, though for action shots (as opposed to a seated presenter) the mechanical system did not scan the televised scene directly. Instead, a 17.5mm film was shot, rapidly developed and then scanned while the film was still wet. An American inventor, Charles Francis Jenkins, also pioneered the television. He published an article on \\"Motion Pictures by Wireless\\" in 1913, but it was not until December 1923 that he transmitted moving silhouette images for witnesses. On June 13, 1925, Jenkins publicly demonstrated the synchronized transmission of silhouette pictures. In 1925, Jenkins used a Nipkow disk and transmitted the silhouette image of a toy windmill in motion, over a distance of five miles (from a naval radio station in Maryland to his laboratory in Washington, D.C.), using a lensed disk scanner with a 48-line resolution.\\"Radio Shows Far Away Objects in Motion\\", The New York Times, June 14, 1925, p. 1. He was granted U.S. patent 1,544,156 (Transmitting Pictures over Wireless) on June 30, 1925 (filed March 13, 1922). On December 25, 1925, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a television system with a 40-line resolution that employed a Nipkow disk scanner and CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This prototype is still on display at the Takayanagi Memorial Museum at Shizuoka University, Hamamatsu Campus.Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television, NHK (Japan Broadcasting Corporation), 2002, retrieved 2009-05-23. By 1927, Takayanagi improved the resolution to 100 lines, which was not surpassed until 1931.High Above: The untold story of Astra, Europe's leading satellite company, page 220, Springer Science+Business Media By 1928, he was the first to transmit human faces in halftones. His work had an influence on the later work of Vladimir K. Zworykin.Albert Abramson, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 231. . By 1935, Takayanagi had invented the first all-electronic television.Popular Photography, November 1990, page 5 His research toward creating a production model was halted by the US after Japan lost World War II. Herbert E. Ives and Frank Gray of Bell Telephone Laboratories gave a dramatic demonstration of mechanical television on April 7, 1927. The reflected-light television system included both small and large viewing screens. The small receiver had a two- inch-wide by 2.5-inch-high screen. The large receiver had a screen 24 inches wide by 30 inches high. Both sets were capable of reproducing reasonably accurate, monochromatic moving images. Along with the pictures, the sets also received synchronized sound. The system transmitted images over two paths: first, a copper wire link from Washington to New York City, then a radio link from Whippany, New Jersey. Comparing the two transmission methods, viewers noted no difference in quality. Subjects of the telecast included Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover. A flying-spot scanner beam illuminated these subjects. The scanner that produced the beam had a 50-aperture disk. The disc revolved at a rate of 18 frames per second, capturing one frame about every 56 milliseconds. (Today's systems typically transmit 30 or 60 frames per second, or one frame every 33.3 or 16.7 milliseconds respectively.) Television historian Albert Abramson underscored the significance of the Bell Labs demonstration: \\"It was in fact the best demonstration of a mechanical television system ever made to this time. It would be several years before any other system could even begin to compare with it in picture quality.\\"Abramson, Albert, The History of Television, 1880 to 1941, McFarland & Co., Inc., 1987, p. 101. . In 1928, WRGB (then W2XB) was started as the world's first television station. It broadcast from the General Electric facility in Schenectady, NY. It was popularly known as \\"WGY Television\\". Meanwhile, in the Soviet Union, L√©on Theremin had been developing a mirror drum-based television, starting with 16-line resolution in 1925, then 32 lines and eventually 64 using interlacing in 1926. As part of his thesis on May 7, 1926, Theremin electrically transmitted and then projected near-simultaneous moving images on a five-foot square screen. By 1927 he achieved an image of 100 lines, a resolution that was not surpassed until 1931 by RCA, with 120 lines. Because only a limited number of holes could be made in the disks, and disks beyond a certain diameter became impractical, image resolution in mechanical television broadcasts was relatively low, ranging from about 30 lines up to about 120. Nevertheless, the image quality of 30-line transmissions steadily improved with technical advances, and by 1933 the UK broadcasts using the Baird system were remarkably clear.Donald F. McLean, Restoring Baird's Image (London: IEEE, 2000), p. 184. A few systems ranging into the 200-line region also went on the air. Two of these were the 180-line system that Compagnie des Compteurs (CDC) installed in Paris in 1935, and the 180-line system that Peck Television Corp. started in 1935 at station VE9AK in Montreal. Anton Codelli (22 March 1875 ‚Äì 28 April 1954), a Slovenian nobleman, was a passionate inventor. Among other things, he had devised a miniature refrigerator for cars and a new rotary engine design. Intrigued by television, he decided to apply his technical skills to the new medium. At the time, the biggest challenge in television technology was to transmit images with sufficient resolution to reproduce recognizable figures. As recounted by media historian Melita Zajc, most inventors were determined to increase the number of lines used by their systems ‚Äì some were approaching what was then the magic number of 100 lines. But Baron Codelli had a different idea. In 1929, he developed a television device with a single line ‚Äì but one that formed a continuous spiral on the screen. Codelli based his ingenious design on his understanding of the human eye. He knew that objects seen in peripheral vision don't need to be as sharp as those in the center. The baron's mechanical television system, whose image was sharpest in the middle, worked well, and he was soon able to transmit images of his wife, Ilona von Drasche-Lazar, over the air. Despite the backing of the German electronics giant Telefunken, however, Codelli's television system never became a commercial reality. Electronic television ultimately emerged as the dominant system, and Codelli moved on to other projects. His invention was largely forgotten.Early Television: A Bibliographic Guide to 1940, page 192, article 1898, Anton CodelliCulture.si: http://www.culture.si/en/Radio-Television_Slovenia_(RTV_Slovenia), The first known transmitted TV image on the territory of Slovenia The advancement of all-electronic television (including image dissectors and other camera tubes and cathode ray tubes for the reproducer) marked the beginning of the end for mechanical systems as the dominant form of television. Mechanical TV usually only produced small images. It was the main type of TV until the 1930s. The last mechanical television broadcasts ended in 1939 at stations run by a handful of public universities in the United States. Electronic television In 1897, J. J. Thomson, an English physicist, in his three famous experiments was able to deflect cathode rays, a fundamental function of the modern Cathode Ray Tube (CRT). The earliest version of the CRT was invented by the German physicist Karl Ferdinand Braun in 1897 and is also known as the Braun tube.Ferdinand Braun (1897) \\"Ueber ein Verfahren zur Demonstration und zum Studium des zeitlichen Verlaufs variabler Str√∂me\\" (On a process for the display and study of the course in time of variable currents), Annalen der Physik und Chemie, 3rd series, 60 : 552-559. It was a cold-cathode diode, a modification of the Crookes tube with a phosphor-coated screen. A cathode ray tube was successfully demonstrated as a displaying device by the German Professor Max Dieckmann in 1906, his experimental results were published by the journal Scientific American in 1909. In 1908 Alan Archibald Campbell- Swinton, fellow of the Royal Society (UK), published a letter in the scientific journal Nature in which he described how \\"distant electric vision\\" could be achieved by using a cathode ray tube (or \\"Braun\\" tube) as both a transmitting and receiving device. He expanded on his vision in a speech given in London in 1911 and reported in The Times\\"Distant Electric Vision\\", The Times (London), Nov. 15, 1911, p. 24b. and the Journal of the R√∂ntgen Society. Shiers, George and May (1997), Early television: a bibliographic guide to 1940. New York: Garland, p. 56. Retrieved 2010-06-13. In a letter to Nature published in October 1926, Campbell-Swinton also announced the results of some \\"not very successful experiments\\" he had conducted with G. M. Minchin and J. C. M. Stanton. They had attempted to generate an electrical signal by projecting an image onto a selenium-coated metal plate that was simultaneously scanned by a cathode ray beam. These experiments were conducted before March 1914, when Minchin died. They were later repeated in 1937 by two different teams, H. Miller and J. W. Strange from EMI, and H. Iams and A. Rose from RCA. Both teams succeeded in transmitting \\"very faint\\" images with the original Campbell-Swinton's selenium-coated plate. Although others had experimented with using a cathode ray tube as a receiver, the concept of using one as a transmitter was novel.Abramson, Albert, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, p. 16. The first cathode ray tube to use a hot cathode was developed by John B. Johnson (who gave his name to the term Johnson noise) and Harry Weiner Weinhart of Western Electric, and became a commercial product in 1922. The problem of low sensitivity to light resulting in low electrical output from transmitting or \\"camera\\" tubes would be solved with the introduction of charge-storage technology by the Hungarian engineer K√°lm√°n Tihanyi in the beginning of 1924. \\"K√°lm√°n Tihanyi (1897‚Äì1947)\\", IEC Techline, International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), 2009-07-15. In 1926, Tihanyi designed a television system utilizing fully electronic scanning and display elements and employing the principle of \\"charge storage\\" within the scanning (or \\"camera\\") tube. His solution was a camera tube that accumulated and stored electrical charges (\\"photoelectrons\\") within the tube throughout each scanning cycle. The device was first described in a patent application he filed in Hungary in March 1926 for a television system he dubbed \\"Radioskop\\".\\"K√°lm√°n Tihanyi's 1926 Patent Application 'Radioskop'\\", Memory of the World, United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), 2005, retrieved 2009-01-29. After further refinements included in a 1928 patent application, Tihanyi's patent was declared void in Great Britain in 1930,Tihanyi, Koloman, Improvements in television apparatus. European Patent Office, Patent No. GB313456. Convention date UK application: 1928-06-11, declared void and published: 1930-11-11, retrieved: 2013-04-25. and so he applied for patents in the United States. Although his breakthrough would be incorporated into the design of RCA's \\"iconoscope\\" in 1931, the U.S. patent for Tihanyi's transmitting tube would not be granted until May 1939. The patent for his receiving tube had been granted the previous October. Both patents had been purchased by RCA prior to their approval. Charge storage remains a basic principle in the design of imaging devices for television to the present day. On December 25, 1926, Kenjiro Takayanagi demonstrated a TV system with a 40-line resolution that employed a CRT display at Hamamatsu Industrial High School in Japan. This was the first working example of a fully electronic television receiver. Takayanagi did not apply for a patent. On September 7, 1927, Philo Farnsworth's image dissector camera tube transmitted its first image, a simple straight line, at his laboratory at 202 Green Street in San Francisco.Postman, Neil, \\"Philo Farnsworth\\", The TIME 100: Scientists & Thinkers, TIME.com, 1999-03-29, retrieved 2009-07-28.\\"Philo Taylor Farnsworth (1906‚Äì1971)\\" , The Virtual Museum of the City of San Francisco, retrieved 2009-07-15. By September 3, 1928, Farnsworth had developed the system sufficiently to hold a demonstration for the press. This is widely regarded as the first electronic television demonstration. In 1929, the system was further improved by elimination of a motor generator, so that his television system now had no mechanical parts.Abramson, Albert, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, p. 226. That year, Farnsworth transmitted the first live human images with his system, including a three and a half-inch image of his wife Elma (\\"Pem\\") with her eyes closed (possibly due to the bright lighting required).The Philo T. and Elma G. Farnsworth Papers Vladimir Zworykin demonstrates electronic television (1929) Meanwhile, Vladimir Zworykin was also experimenting with the cathode ray tube to create and show images. While working for Westinghouse Electric in 1923, he began to develop an electronic camera tube. But in a 1925 demonstration, the image was dim, had low contrast and poor definition, and was stationary.Abramson, Albert, Zworykin, Pioneer of Television, University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 51. . Zworykin's imaging tube never got beyond the laboratory stage. But RCA, which acquired the Westinghouse patent, asserted that the patent for Farnsworth's 1927 image dissector was written so broadly that it would exclude any other electronic imaging device. Thus RCA, on the basis of Zworykin's 1923 patent application, filed a patent interference suit against Farnsworth. The U.S. Patent Office examiner disagreed in a 1935 decision, finding priority of invention for Farnsworth against Zworykin. Farnsworth claimed that Zworykin's 1923 system would be unable to produce an electrical image of the type to challenge his patent. Zworykin received a patent in 1928 for a color transmission version of his 1923 patent application,Zworykin, Vladimir K., Television System. Patent No. 1691324, U.S. Patent Office.

In September 1939, after losing an appeal in the courts and determined to go forward with the commercial manufacturing of television equipment, RCA agreed to pay Farnsworth US$1 million over a ten-year period, in addition to license payments, to use Farnsworth's patents.Stashower, Daniel, The Boy Genius and the Mogul: The Untold Story of Television, Broadway Books, 2002, p. 243‚Äì244. .Everson, George (1949), The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T. Farnsworth New York City: W. W. Norton & Co., , 266 pages In 1933 RCA introduced an improved camera tube that relied on Tihanyi's charge storage principle. Dubbed the Iconoscope by Zworykin, the new tube had a light sensitivity of about 75,000 lux, and thus was claimed to be much more sensitive than Farnsworth's image dissector. However, Farnsworth had overcome his power problems with his Image Dissector through the invention of a completely unique \\"multipactor\\" device that he began work on in 1930, and demonstrated in 1931.Abramson, Albert (1987), The History of Television, 1880 to 1941.

Norton & Co., , page 139. and showed great promise in all fields of electronics. A problem with the multipactor, unfortunately, was that it wore out at an unsatisfactory rate.Everson, George (1949), The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T. Farnsworth New York: W. W. Norton & Co., , page 141. At the Berlin Radio Show in August 1931, Manfred von Ardenne gave a public demonstration of a television system using a CRT for both transmission and reception. However, Ardenne had not developed a camera tube, using the CRT instead as a flying-spot scanner to scan slides and film.Albert Abramson, Zworykin: Pioneer of Television, University of Illinois Press, 1995, p. 111. Philo Farnsworth gave the world's first public demonstration of an all-electronic television system, using a live camera, at the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia on August 25, 1934, and for ten days afterwards.\\"New Television System Uses 'Magnetic Lens'\\", Popular Mechanics, Dec. 1934, p. 838‚Äì839.Burns, R. W. Television: An international history of the formative years. (1998). IEE History of Technology Series, 22. London: IEE, p. 370. . In Britain the EMI engineering team led by Isaac Shoenberg applied in 1932 for a patent for a new device they dubbed \\"the Emitron\\", which formed the heart of the cameras they designed for the BBC. In November 1936, a 405-line broadcasting service employing the Emitron began at studios in Alexandra Palace, and transmitted from a specially built mast atop one of the Victorian building's towers. It alternated for a short time with Baird's mechanical system in adjoining studios, but was more reliable and visibly superior. This was the world's first regular high-definition television service.Burns, R. W., Television: An international history of the formative years. (1998). IEE History of Technology Series, 22. London: IEE, p. 576. . The original American iconoscope was noisy, had a high ratio of interference to signal, and ultimately gave disappointing results, especially when compared to the high definition mechanical scanning systems then becoming available. The EMI team under the supervision of Isaac Shoenberg analyzed how the iconoscope (or Emitron) produces an electronic signal and concluded that its real efficiency was only about 5% of the theoretical maximum. They solved this problem by developing and patenting in 1934 two new camera tubes dubbed super-Emitron and CPS Emitron. The super-Emitron was between ten and fifteen times more sensitive than the original Emitron and iconoscope tubes and, in some cases, this ratio was considerably greater. It was used for an outside broadcasting by the BBC, for the first time, on Armistice Day 1937, when the general public could watch in a television set how the King lay a wreath at the Cenotaph. This was the first time that anyone could broadcast a live street scene from cameras installed on the roof of neighbor buildings, because neither Farnsworth nor RCA could do the same before the 1939 New York World's Fair. Ad for the beginning of experimental television broadcasting in New York City by RCA in 1939 On the other hand, in 1934, Zworykin shared some patent rights with the German licensee company Telefunken. The \\"image iconoscope\\" (\\"Superikonoskop\\" in Germany) was produced as a result of the collaboration. This tube is essentially identical to the super-Emitron. The production and commercialization of the super-Emitron and image iconoscope in Europe were not affected by the patent war between Zworykin and Farnsworth, because Dieckmann and Hell had priority in Germany for the invention of the image dissector, having submitted a patent application for their Lichtelektrische Bildzerlegerr√∂hre f√ºr Fernseher (Photoelectric Image Dissector Tube for Television) in Germany in 1925, two years before Farnsworth did the same in the United States. The image iconoscope (Superikonoskop) became the industrial standard for public broadcasting in Europe from 1936 until 1960, when it was replaced by the vidicon and plumbicon tubes. Indeed, it was the representative of the European tradition in electronic tubes competing against the American tradition represented by the image orthicon. The German company Heimann produced the Superikonoskop for the 1936 Berlin Olympic Games, later Heimann also produced and commercialized it from 1940 to 1955, finally the Dutch company Philips produced and commercialized the image iconoscope and multicon from 1952 to 1958. American television broadcasting at the time consisted of a variety of markets in a wide range of sizes, each competing for programming and dominance with separate technology, until deals were made and standards agreed upon in 1941.Everson, George (1949), The Story of Television, The Life of Philo T. Farnsworth New York: W. W. Norton & Co., , page 248. RCA, for example, used only Iconoscopes in the New York area, but Farnsworth Image Dissectors in Philadelphia and San Francisco.Abramson, Albert (1987), The History of Television, 1880 to 1941. Jefferson, NC: Albert Abramson. p. 254. . In September 1939, RCA agreed to pay the Farnsworth Television and Radio Corporation royalties over the next ten years for access to Farnsworth's patents.Schatzkin, Paul (2002), The Boy Who Invented Television. Silver Spring, Maryland: Teamcom Books, pp. 187‚Äì8. . With this historic agreement in place, RCA integrated much of what was best about the Farnsworth Technology into their systems. In 1941, the United States implemented 525-line television.\\"Go-Ahead Signal Due for Television\\", The New York Times, April 25, 1941, p. 7.\\"An Auspicious Beginning\\", The New York Times, August 3, 1941, p.

The first broadcast in 625-line standard occurred in 1948 in Moscow.\\"M.I. Krivocheev ‚Äì an engineer's engineer\\", EBU Technical Review, Spring 1993. The concept of 625 lines per frame was subsequently implemented in the European CCIR standard. In 1936, K√°lm√°n Tihanyi described the principle of plasma display, the first flat panel display system. In 1978, James P Mitchell described, prototyped and demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display LED Display targeted at replacing the CRT. Color television The basic idea of using three monochrome images to produce a color image had been experimented with almost as soon as black-and-white televisions had first been built. Older televisions have the RGB (Red-Green- Blue) color scheme while modern televisions focus on LEDs to create the image. Among the earliest published proposals for television was one by Maurice Le Blanc in 1880 for a color system, including the first mentions in television literature of line and frame scanning, although he gave no practical details.M. Le Blanc, \\"Etude sur la transmission √©lectrique des impressions lumineuses\\", La Lumi√®re Electrique, vol. 11, December 1, 1880, p. 477‚Äì481. Polish inventor Jan Szczepanik patented a color television system in 1897, using a selenium photoelectric cell at the transmitter and an electromagnet controlling an oscillating mirror and a moving prism at the receiver. But his system contained no means of analyzing the spectrum of colors at the transmitting end, and could not have worked as he described it.R. W. Burns, Television: An International History of the Formative Years, IET, 1998, p. 98. . Another inventor, Hovannes Adamian, also experimented with color television as early as 1907. The first color television project is claimed by him,Western technology and Soviet economic development: 1945 to 1965, by Antony C. Sutton, Business & Economics - 1973, p. 330 and was patented in Germany on March 31, 1908, patent No. 197183, then in Britain, on April 1, 1908, patent No. 7219,The History of Television, 1880-1941, by Albert Abramson, 1987, p. 27 in France (patent No. 390326) and in Russia in 1910 (patent No. 17912).A. Rokhlin, Tak rozhdalos' dal'novidenie (in Russian) Scottish inventor John Logie Baird demonstrated the world's first color transmission on July 3, 1928, using scanning discs at the transmitting and receiving ends with three spirals of apertures, each spiral with filters of a different primary color; and three light sources at the receiving end, with a commutator to alternate their illumination.John Logie Baird, Television Apparatus and the Like, U.S. patent, filed in U.K. in 1928. Baird also made the world's first color broadcast on February 4, 1938, sending a mechanically scanned 120-line image from Baird's Crystal Palace studios to a projection screen at London's Dominion Theatre.Baird Television: Crystal Palace Television Studios. Previous color television demonstrations in the U.K. and U.S. had been via closed circuit. Mechanically scanned color television was also demonstrated by Bell Laboratories in June 1929 using three complete systems of photoelectric cells, amplifiers, glow-tubes and color filters, with a series of mirrors to superimpose the red, green and blue images into one full color image. The first practical hybrid system was again pioneered by John Logie Baird. In 1940 he publicly demonstrated a color television combining a traditional black-and- white display with a rotating colored disc. This device was very \\"deep\\", but was later improved with a mirror folding the light path into an entirely practical device resembling a large conventional console. However, Baird was not happy with the design, and as early as 1944 had commented to a British government committee that a fully electronic device would be better. Mexican inventor Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena also played an important role in early TV. His experiments with TV (known as telectroescop√≠a at first) began in 1931 and led to a patent for the \\"trichromatic field sequential system\\" color television in 1940. In 1939, Hungarian engineer Peter Carl Goldmark introduced an electro-mechanical system while at CBS, which contained an Iconoscope sensor. The CBS field-sequential color system was partly mechanical, with a disc made of red, blue, and green filters spinning inside the television camera at 1,200 rpm, and a similar disc spinning in synchronization in front of the cathode ray tube inside the receiver set.Peter C. Goldmark, assignor to Columbia Broadcasting System, \\"Color Television\\", U.S. Patent 2,480,571, filed Sept. 7, 1940. The system was first demonstrated to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) on August 29, 1940, and shown to the press on September 4.Current Broadcasting 1940\\"Color Television Success in Test\\", The New York Times, August 30, 1940, p. 21.\\"Color Television Achieves Realism\\", The New York Times, Sept. 5, 1940, p. 18.\\"New Television System Transmits Images in Full Color\\", Popular Science, December 1940, p. 120.

NBC (owned by RCA) made its first field test of color television on February 20, 1941. CBS began daily color field tests on June 1, 1941.Ed Reitan, RCA-NBC Color Firsts in Television (commented). These color systems were not compatible with existing black-and-white television sets, and as no color television sets were available to the public at this time, viewing of the color field tests was restricted to RCA and CBS engineers and the invited press. The War Production Board halted the manufacture of television and radio equipment for civilian use from April 22, 1942, to August 20, 1945, limiting any opportunity to introduce color television to the general public.\\"Making of Radios and Phonographs to End April 22,\\" The New York Times, March 8, 1942, p. 1. \\"Radio Production Curbs Cover All Combinations,\\" Wall Street Journal, June 3, 1942, p. 4. \\"WPB Cancels 210 Controls; Radios, Trucks in Full Output,\\" The New York Times, August 21, 1945, p. 1.Bob Cooper, \\"Television: The Technology That Changed Our Lives\\", Early Television Foundation. As early as 1940, Baird had started work on a fully electronic system he called the \\"Telechrome\\". Early Telechrome devices used two electron guns aimed at either side of a phosphor plate. Using cyan and magenta phosphors, a reasonable limited-color image could be obtained. He also demonstrated the same system using monochrome signals to produce a 3D image (called \\"stereoscopic\\" at the time). A demonstration on August 16, 1944 was the first example of a practical color television system. Work on the Telechrome continued and plans were made to introduce a three-gun version for full color. This used a patterned version of the phosphor plate, with the guns aimed at ridges on one side of the plate. However, Baird's untimely death in 1946 ended development of the Telechrome system.Albert Abramson, The History of Television, 1942 to 2000, McFarland & Company, 2003, pp. 13‚Äì14. Baird Television: The World's First High Definition Colour Television System. Similar concepts were common through the 1940s and 1950s, differing primarily in the way they re-combined the colors generated by the three guns. The Geer tube was similar to Baird's concept, but used small pyramids with the phosphors deposited on their outside faces, instead of Baird's 3D patterning on a flat surface. The Penetron used three layers of phosphor on top of each other and increased the power of the beam to reach the upper layers when drawing those colors. The Chromatron used a set of focusing wires to select the colored phosphors arranged in vertical stripes on the tube. One of the great technical challenges of introducing color broadcast television was the desire to conserve bandwidth, potentially three times that of the existing black-and-white standards, and not use an excessive amount of radio spectrum. In the United States, after considerable research, the National Television Systems CommitteeNational Television System Committee (1951‚Äì1953), [Report and Reports of Panel No. 11, 11-A, 12‚Äì19, with Some supplementary references cited in the Reports, and the Petition for adoption of transmission standards for color television before the Federal Communications Commission, n.p., 1953], 17 v. illus., diagrams., tables. 28 cm. LC Control No.:54021386 Library of Congress Online Catalog approved an all-electronic Compatible color system developed by RCA, which encoded the color information separately from the brightness information and greatly reduced the resolution of the color information in order to conserve bandwidth. The brightness image remained compatible with existing black-and- white television sets at slightly reduced resolution, while color televisions could decode the extra information in the signal and produce a limited- resolution color display. The higher resolution black-and-white and lower resolution color images combine in the brain to produce a seemingly high- resolution color image. The NTSC standard represented a major technical achievement. Color bars used in a test pattern, sometimes used when no program material is available. Although all-electronic color was introduced in the U.S. in 1953, high prices and the scarcity of color programming greatly slowed its acceptance in the marketplace. The first national color broadcast (the 1954 Tournament of Roses Parade) occurred on January 1, 1954, but during the following ten years most network broadcasts, and nearly all local programming, continued to be in black-and-white. It was not until the mid-1960s that color sets started selling in large numbers, due in part to the color transition of 1965 in which it was announced that over half of all network prime-time programming would be broadcast in color that fall. The first all-color prime- time season came just one year later. In 1972, the last holdout among daytime network programs converted to color, resulting in the first completely all- color network season. Early color sets were either floor-standing console models or tabletop versions nearly as bulky and heavy, so in practice they remained firmly anchored in one place. The introduction of GE's relatively compact and lightweight Porta-Color set in the spring of 1966 made watching color television a more flexible and convenient proposition. In 1972, sales of color sets finally surpassed sales of black-and-white sets. Color broadcasting in Europe was also not standardized on the PAL format until the 1960s. By the mid-1970s, the only stations broadcasting in black-and-white were a few high- numbered UHF stations in small markets, and a handful of low-power repeater stations in even smaller markets such as vacation spots. By 1979, even the last of these had converted to color, and by the early 1980s black-and-white sets had been pushed into niche markets, notably low-power uses, small portable sets, or use as video monitor screens in lower-cost consumer equipment. By the late 1980s even these areas switched to color sets. Digital television Digital television (DTV) is the transmission of audio and video by digitally processed and multiplexed signal, in contrast to the totally analog and channel separated signals used by analog television. Digital TV can support more than one program in the same channel bandwidth. It is an innovative service that represents the first significant evolution in television technology since color television in the 1950s.Kruger, L. G. (2001). Digital Television: An Overview. Hauppauge, New York: Nova Publishers. Digital TV's roots have been tied very closely to the availability of inexpensive, high-performance computers. It wasn't until the 1990s that digital TV became a real possibility. In the mid-1980s Japanese consumer electronics firm Sony Corporation developed HDTV technology and the equipment to record at such resolution, and the MUSE analog format proposed by NHK, a Japanese broadcaster, was seen as a pacesetter that threatened to eclipse U.S. electronics companies. Sony's system produced images at 1125-line resolution (or in digital terms, 1875x1125, close to the resolution of Full HD video1125 divided by 3, and then multiplied by 5, due to the 5:3 aspect ratio, asumming square pixels) Until June 1990, the Japanese MUSE standard‚Äîbased on an analog system‚Äîwas the front-runner among the more than 23 different technical concepts under consideration. Then, an American company, General Instrument, demonstrated the feasibility of a digital television signal. This breakthrough was of such significance that the FCC was persuaded to delay its decision on an ATV standard until a digitally based standard could be developed. In March 1990, when it became clear that a digital standard was feasible, the FCC made a number of critical decisions. First, the Commission declared that the new ATV standard must be more than an enhanced analog signal, but be able to provide a genuine HDTV signal with at least twice the resolution of existing television images. Then, to ensure that viewers who did not wish to buy a new digital television set could continue to receive conventional television broadcasts, it dictated that the new ATV standard must be capable of being \\"simulcast\\" on different channels.The new ATV standard also allowed the new DTV signal to be based on entirely new design principles. Although incompatible with the existing NTSC standard, the new DTV standard would be able to incorporate many improvements. The final standard adopted by the FCC did not require a single standard for scanning formats, aspect ratios, or lines of resolution. This outcome resulted from a dispute between the consumer electronics industry (joined by some broadcasters) and the computer industry (joined by the film industry and some public interest groups) over which of the two scanning processes‚Äîinterlaced or progressive‚Äîis superior. Interlaced scanning, which is used in televisions worldwide, scans even-numbered lines first, then odd-numbered ones. Progressive scanning, which is the format used in computers, scans lines in sequences, from top to bottom. The computer industry argued that progressive scanning is superior because it does not \\"flicker\\" in the manner of interlaced scanning. It also argued that progressive scanning enables easier connections with the Internet, and is more cheaply converted to interlaced formats than vice versa. The film industry also supported progressive scanning because it offers a more efficient means of converting filmed programming into digital formats. For their part, the consumer electronics industry and broadcasters argued that interlaced scanning was the only technology that could transmit the highest quality pictures then feasible, that is, 1080 lines per picture and 1920 pixels per line. William F. Schreiber, who was a director of the Advanced Television Research Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology from 1983 until his retirement in 1990, thought that the continued advocacy of interlaced equipment originated from consumer electronics companies that were trying to get back the substantial investments they made in the interlaced technology. Digital television transition started in the late 2000s. All the governments across the world set the deadline for analog shutdown by the 2010s. Initially the adoption rate was low. But soon, more and more households were converting to digital televisions. The transition was expected to be complete worldwide by the mid to late 2010s. Smart television Advent of digital television allowed innovations like smart TVs. A smart television, sometimes referred to as connected TV or hybrid television, is a television set with integrated Internet and Web 2.0 features, and is an example of technological convergence between computers and television sets and set-top boxes. Besides the traditional functions of television sets and set-top boxes provided through traditional broadcasting media, these devices can also provide Internet TV, online interactive media, over-the-top content, as well as on-demand streaming media, and home networking access. These TVs come pre-loaded with an operating system. Smart TV should not to be confused with Internet TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Internet television refers to the receiving television content over internet instead of traditional systems (terrestrial, cable and satellite) (although internet itself is received by these methods). Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television (WebTV) is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV. A first patent was filed in 1994 (and extended the following year) for an \\"intelligent\\" television system, linked with data processing systems, by means of a digital or analog network. Apart from being linked to data networks, one key point is its ability to automatically download necessary software routines, according to a user's demand, and process their needs. Major TV manufacturers have announced production of smart TVs only, for middle-end and high-end TVs in 2015. 3D television Stereoscopic 3D television was demonstrated for the first time on August 10, 1928, by John Logie Baird in his company's premises at 133 Long Acre, London. Baird pioneered a variety of 3D television systems using electro-mechanical and cathode-ray tube techniques. The first 3D TV was produced in 1935. The advent of digital television in the 2000s greatly improved 3D TVs. Although 3D TV sets are quite popular for watching 3D home media such as on Blu-ray discs, 3D programming has largely failed to make inroads among the public. Many 3D television channels that started in the early 2010s were shut down by the mid-2010s. Terrestrial television = Overview = Programming is broadcast by television stations, sometimes called \\"channels\\", as stations are licensed by their governments to broadcast only over assigned channels in the television band. At first, terrestrial broadcasting was the only way television could be widely distributed, and because bandwidth was limited, i.e., there were only a small number of channels available, government regulation was the norm. = Canada = The Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) adopted the American NTSC 525-line B/W 60 field per second system as its broadcast standard. It began television broadcasting in Canada in September 1952. The first broadcast was on September 6, 1952 from its Montreal station CBFT. The premiere broadcast was bilingual, spoken in English and French. Two days later, on September 8, 1952, the Toronto station CBLT went on the air. This became the English-speaking flagship station for the country, while CBFT became the French-language flagship after a second English-language station was licensed to CBC in Montreal later in the decade. The CBC's first privately owned affiliate television station, CKSO in Sudbury, Ontario, launched in October 1953 (at the time, all private stations were expected to affiliate with the CBC, a condition that was relaxed in 1960‚Äì61 when CTV, Canada's second national English-language network, was formed). = Czechoslovakia = The first mass-produced Czechoslovak TV-set Tesla 4001A (1953-57). In former Czechoslovakia (now Slovakia and the Czech Republic) the first experimental television sets were produced in 1948. In the same year the first TV- transmission was performed. The first regular TV public transmission started on May 1, 1953. The state-owned TV-centers were in Prague, Bratislava, Brno and Ostrava. In 1961 more than a million citizens had a television set. In 1970, Czechoslovak television had three channels: Czech, Slovak and a bilingual Federal Channel. In 1973, color broadcasting started. = France = The first experiments in television broadcasting began in France in the 1930s, although the French did not immediately employ the new technology. In November 1929, Bernard Natan established France's first television company, T√©l√©vision- Baird-Natan. On April 14, 1931, there took place the first transmission with a thirty-line standard by Ren√© Barth√©lemy. On December 6, 1931, Henri de France created the Compagnie G√©n√©rale de T√©l√©vision (CGT). In December 1932, Barth√©lemy carried out an experimental program in black and white (definition: 60 lines) one hour per week, \\"Paris T√©l√©vision\\", which gradually became daily from early 1933. The first official channel of French television appeared on February 13, 1935, the date of the official inauguration of television in France, which was broadcast in 60 lines from 8:15 to 8:30 pm. The program showed the actress B√©atrice Bretty in the studio of Radio-PTT Vision at 103 rue de Grenelle in Paris. The broadcast had a range of . On November 10, George Mandel, Minister of Posts, inaugurated the first broadcast in 180 lines from the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower. On the 18th, Susy Wincker, the first announcer since the previous June, carried out a demonstration for the press from 5:30 to 7:30 pm. Broadcasts became regular from January 4, 1937 from 11:00 to 11:30 am and 8:00 to 8:30 pm during the week, and from 5:30 to 7:30 pm on Sundays. In July 1938, a decree defined for three years a standard of 455 lines VHF (whereas three standards were used for the experiments: 441 lines for Gramont, 450 lines for the Compagnie des Compteurs and 455 for Thomson). In 1939, there were about only 200 to 300 individual television sets, some of which were also available in a few public places. With the entry of France into World War II the same year, broadcasts ceased and the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was sabotaged. On September 3, 1940, French television was seized by the German occupation forces. A technical agreement was signed by the Compagnie des Compteurs and Telefunken, and a financing agreement for the resuming of the service is signed by German Ministry of Post and Radiodiffusion Nationale (Vichy's radio). On May 7, 1943 at 3:00 evening broadcasts. The first broadcast of Fernsehsender Paris (Paris T√©l√©vision) was transmitted from rue Cognac-Jay. These regular broadcasts (5 hours a day) lasted until August 16, 1944. One thousand 441-line sets, most of which were installed in soldiers' hospitals, picked up the broadcasts. These Nazi- controlled television broadcasts from the Eiffel Tower in Paris were able to be received on the south coast of England by R.A.F. and BBC engineers,http://www.earlytelevision.org/raf.html R.A.F. Reception of German TV from Paris, retrieved 2013 April 23 who photographed the station identification image direct from the screen. In 1944, Ren√© Barth√©lemy developed an 819-line television standard. During the years of occupation, Barth√©lemy reached 1015 and even 1042 lines. On October 1, 1944, television service resumed after the liberation of Paris. The broadcasts were transmitted from the Cognacq-Jay studios. In October 1945, after repairs, the transmitter of the Eiffel Tower was back in service. On November 20, 1948, Fran√ßois Mitterrand decreed a broadcast standard of 819 lines; broadcasting began at the end of 1949 in this definition. Besides France, this standard was later adopted by Algeria, Monaco, and Morocco. Belgium and Luxembourg used a modified version of this standard with bandwidth narrowed to 7 MHz. = Germany = Electromechanical broadcasts began in Germany in 1929, but were without sound until 1934. Network electronic service started on March 22, 1935, on 180 lines using telecine transmission of film, intermediate film system, or cameras using the Nipkow Disk. Transmissions using cameras based on the iconoscope began on January 15, 1936. The Berlin Summer Olympic Games were televised, using both all-electronic iconoscope-based cameras and intermediate film cameras, to Berlin and Hamburg in August 1936. Twenty-eight public television rooms were opened for anybody who did not own a television set. The Germans had a 441-line system on the air in February 1937, and during World War II brought it to France, where they broadcast from the Eiffel Tower. After the end of World War II, the victorious Allies imposed a general ban on all radio and television broadcasting in Germany. Radio broadcasts for information purposes were soon permitted again, but television broadcasting was allowed to resume only in 1948. In East Germany, the head of broadcasting in the Soviet occupation zone, Hans Mahler, predicted in 1948 that in the near future ‚Äòa new and important technical step forward in the field of broadcasting in Germany will begin its triumphant march: television.‚Äô In 1950, the plans for a nationwide television service got off the ground, and a Television Centre in Berlin was approved. Transmissions began on December 21, 1952 using the 625-line standard developed in the Soviet Union in 1944, although at that time there were probably no more than 75 television receivers capable of receiving the programming.\\"TV in the GDR\\", Loughborough University\\"Fernsehen aus Adlershof\\", Deutsches Rundfunkarchiv Babelsberg In West Germany, the British occupation forces as well as NWDR (Nordwestdeutscher Rundfunk), which had started work in the British zone straight after the war, agreed to the launch of a television station. Even before this, German television specialists had agreed on 625 lines as the future standard.\\"50 years of Eurovision\\", EBU, January, 2004. This standard had narrower channel bandwidth (7 MHz) compared to the Soviet specification (8 MHz), allowing three television channels to fit into the VHF I band. When color was introduced, West Germany chose a variant of the NTSC color system, modified by Walter Bruch and called PAL. East Germany accepted the French SECAM system, which was used in Eastern European countries. With the reunification of Germany, it was decided to switch to the PAL color system. The system was changed in December 1990. = Italy = In Italy, the first experimental tests on television broadcasts were made in Turin since 1934. The city already hosted the Center for Management of the EIAR (lately renamed as RAI) at the premises of the Theatre of Turin. Subsequently, the EAIR established offices in Rome and Milan. On July 22, 1939 comes into operation in Rome the first television transmitter at the EIAR station, which performed a regular broadcast for about a year using a 441-line system that was developed in Germany. In September of the same year, a second television transmitter was installed in Milan, making experimental broadcasts during major events in the city. The broadcasts were suddenly ended on May 31, 1940, by order of the government, allegedly because of interferences encountered in the first air navigation systems. Also, the imminent participation in the war is believed to have played a role in this decision. EIAR transmitting equipment was relocated to Germany by the German troops. Lately, it was returned to Italy. The first official television broadcast began on January 3, 1954 by the RAI. = Japan = Television broadcasting in Japan started on August 28, 1953, making the country one of the first in the world with an experimental television service. The first television tests were conducted as early as 1926 using a combined mechanical Nipkow disk and electronic Braun tube system, later switching to an all-electronic system in 1935 using a domestically developed iconoscope system.Kenjiro Takayanagi: The Father of Japanese Television . Retrieved 2012-11-01. In spite of that, because of the beginning of World War II in the Pacific region, this first full-fledged TV broadcast experimentation lasted only a few months. Regular television broadcasts would eventually start in 1953. In 1979, NHK first developed a consumer high-definition television with a 5:3 display aspect ratio. The system, known as Hi-Vision or MUSE after its Multiple sub-Nyquist sampling encoding for encoding the signal, required about twice the bandwidth of the existing NTSC system but provided about four times the resolution (1080i/1125 lines). Satellite test broadcasts started in 1989, with regular testing starting in 1991 and regular broadcasting of BS-9ch commenced on November 25, 1994, which featured commercial and NHK television programming. Sony first demonstrated a wideband analog high-definition television system HDTV capable video camera, monitor and video tape recorder (VTR) in April 1981 at an international meeting of television engineers in Algiers. The Sony HDVS range was launched in April 1984, with the HDC-100 camera, HDV-100 video recorder and HDS-100 video switcher all working in the 1125-line component video format with interlaced video and a 5:3 aspect ratio. = Mexico = The first testing television station in Mexico signed on in 1935. When KFMB-TV in San Diego signed on in 1949, Baja California became the first state to receive a commercial television station over the air. Within a year, the Mexican government would adopt the U.S. NTSC 525-line B/W 60-field-per-second system as the country's broadcast standard. In 1950, the first commercial television station within Mexico, XHTV in Mexico City, signed on the air, followed by XEW-TV in 1951 and XHGC in 1952. Those three were not only the first television stations in the country, but also the flagship stations of Telesistema Mexicano, which was formed in 1955. That year, Emilio Azc√°rraga Vidaurreta, who had signed on XEW-TV, entered into a partnership with R√≥mulo O'Farrill who had signed on XHTV, and Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena, who had signed on XHGC. The earliest 3D television broadcasts in the world were broadcast over XHGC in 1954. Color television was introduced in 1962, also over XHGC-TV. One of Telesistema Mexicano's earliest broadcasts as a network, over XEW-TV, on June 25, 1955, was the first international North American broadcast in the medium's history, and was jointly aired with NBC in the United States, where it aired as the premiere episode of Wide Wide World, and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. Except for a brief period between 1969 and 1973, nearly every commercial television station in Mexico, with exceptions in the border cities, was expected to affiliate with a subnetwork of Telesistema Mexicano or its successor, Televisa (formed by the 1973 merger of Telesistema Mexicano and Television Independiente de Mexico). This condition would not be relaxed for good until 1993, when Imevision was privatized to become TV Azteca. = Soviet Union (USSR) = The Soviet Union began offering 30-line electromechanical test broadcasts in Moscow on October 31, 1931, and a commercially manufactured television set in 1932. First electronic television system on 180 lines at 25 fps was created in the beginning of 1935 in Leningrad (St. Petersburg). In September 1937 the experimental Leningrad TV Center (OLTC) was put in action. OLTC worked with 240 lines at 25 fps progressive scan. In Moscow, experimental transmissions of electronic television took place on March 9, 1937, using equipment manufactured by RCA. Regular broadcasting began on December 31, 1938. It was quickly realized that 343 lines of resolution offered by this format would have become insufficient in the long run, thus a specification for 441-line format at 25 fps interlaced was developed in 1940. Television broadcasts were suspended during Great Patriotic War. In 1944, while the war was still raging, a new standard, offering 625 lines of vertical resolution was prepared. This format was ultimately accepted as a national standard. The transmissions in 625-line format started in Moscow on November 4, 1948. Regular broadcasting began on June 16, 1949. Details for this standard were formalized in 1955 specification called GOST 7845-55, basic parameters for black-and-white television broadcast. In particular, frame size was set to 625 lines, frame rate to 25 frames/s interlaced, and video bandwidth to 6 MHz. These basic parameters were accepted by most countries having 50 Hz mains frequency and became the foundation of television systems presently known as PAL and SECAM. Starting in 1951, broadcasting in the 625-line standard was introduced in other major cities of the Soviet Union. Color television broadcast started in 1967, using SECAM color system. = Turkey = The first Turkish television channel, ITU TV, was launched in 1952. The first national television is TRT 1 and was launched in 1964. Color television was introduced in 1981. Before 1989 there was the only channel, the state broadcasting company TRT, and it broadcast in several times of the dateline. Turkey's first private television channel Star started it broadcast on 26 May 1989. Until then there was only one television channel controlled by the state, but with the wave of liberalization, privately owned broadcasting began. Turkey's television market is defined by a handful of big channels, led by Kanal D, ATV and Show, with 14%, 10% and 9.6% market share, respectively. The most important reception platforms are terrestrial and satellite, with almost 50% of homes using satellite (of these 15% were pay services) at the end of 2009. Three services dominate the multi-channel market: the satellite platforms Digit√ºrk and D-Smart and the cable TV service T√ºrksat. = United Kingdom = The first British television broadcast was made by Baird Television's electromechanical system over the BBC radio transmitter in September 1929. Baird provided a limited amount of programming five days a week by 1930. During this time, Southampton earned the distinction of broadcasting the first-ever live television interview, which featured Peggy O'Neil, an actress and singer from Buffalo, New York.Hawley, Chris, \\"Peggy O'Neil sang her way from the Hydraulics to stardom\\", The Hydraulics [blog], January 15, 2009. On August 22, 1932, BBC launched its own regular service using Baird's 30-line electromechanical system, continuing until September 11, 1935. On November 2, 1936, the BBC began transmitting the world's first public regular high- definition service from the Victorian Alexandra Palace in north London. It therefore claims to be the birthplace of TV broadcasting as we know it today. It was a dual-system service, alternating between Marconi-EMI's 405-line standard and Baird's improved 240-line standard, from Alexandra Palace in London. The BBC Television Service continues to this day. The government, on advice from a special advisory committee, decided that Marconi-EMI's electronic system gave the superior picture, and the Baird system was dropped in February 1937. TV broadcasts in London were on the air an average of four hours daily from 1936 to 1939. There were 12,000 to 15,000 receivers. Some sets in restaurants or bars might have 100 viewers for sport events (Dunlap, p56). The outbreak of the Second World War caused the BBC service to be abruptly suspended on September 1, 1939, at 12:35 pm, after a Mickey Mouse cartoon and test signals were broadcast, so that transmissions could not be used as a beacon to guide enemy aircraft to London. It resumed, again from Alexandra Palace on June 7, 1946 after the end of the war, began with a live programme that opened with the line \\"Good afternoon everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh?\\" and was followed by the same Mickey Mouse cartoon broadcast on the last day before the war. At the end of 1947 there were 54,000 licensed television receivers, compared with 44,000 television sets in the United States at that time. The first transatlantic television signal was sent in 1928 from London to New York by the Baird Television Development Company/Cinema Television, although this signal was not broadcast to the public. The first live satellite signal to Britain from the United States was broadcast via the Telstar satellite on July 23, 1962. The first live broadcast from the European continent was made on August 27, 1950. = United States = WNBT (later WNBC) schedule for first week of commercial TV programming in the United States, July 1941 American family watching TV, 1958 WRGB claims to be the world's oldest television station, tracing its roots to an experimental station founded on January 13, 1928, broadcasting from the General Electric factory in Schenectady, NY, under the call letters W2XB. It was popularly known as \\"WGY Television\\" after its sister radio station. Later in 1928, General Electric started a second facility, this one in New York City, which had the call letters W2XBS and which today is known as WNBC. The two stations were experimental in nature and had no regular programming, as receivers were operated by engineers within the company. The image of a Felix the Cat doll rotating on a turntable was broadcast for 2 hours every day for several years as new technology was being tested by the engineers. The first regularly scheduled television service in the United States began on July 2, 1928, fifteen months before the United Kingdom. The Federal Radio Commission authorized C. F. Jenkins to broadcast from experimental station W3XK in Wheaton, Maryland, a suburb of Washington, D.C. For at least the first eighteen months, 48-line silhouette images from motion picture film were broadcast, although beginning in the summer of 1929 he occasionally broadcast in halftones.\\"What Television Offers You\\", Popular Mechanics, November 1928, p. 823.\\"The Latest in Television\\", Popular Mechanics, September 1929, p. 472. Hugo Gernsback's New York City radio station began a regular, if limited, schedule of live television broadcasts on August 14, 1928, using 48-line images. Working with only one transmitter, the station alternated radio broadcasts with silent television images of the station's call sign, faces in motion, and wind-up toys in motion.\\"WRNY to Start Daily Television Broadcasts; Radio Audience Will See Studio Artist\\", The New York Times, August 13, 1928, p. 13.\\"WRNY Has Extended Television Schedule\\", The New York Times, September 30, 1928, p. 155. Speaking later that month, Gernsback downplayed the broadcasts, intended for amateur experimenters. \\"In six months we may have television for the public, but so far we have not got it.\\"\\"Television Drama Shown With Music\\", The New York Times, August 22, 1928, p. 1. Gernsback also published Television, the world's first magazine about the medium. General Electric's experimental station in Schenectady, New York, on the air sporadically since January 13, 1928, was able to broadcast reflected-light, 48-line images via shortwave as far as Los Angeles, and by September was making four television broadcasts weekly. It is considered to be the direct predecessor of current television station WRGB. The Queen's Messenger, a one- act play broadcast on September 11, 1928, was the world's first live drama on television.The Queen's Messenger, Early Television Museum. Radio giant RCA began daily experimental television broadcasts in New York City in March 1929 over station W2XBS, the predecessor of current television station WNBC. The 60-line transmissions consisted of pictures, signs, and views of persons and objects.\\"Television Placed on Daily Schedule\\", The New York Times, March 22, 1929, p. 30. Experimental broadcasts continued to 1931.\\"Six Visual Stations on the New York Air\\", The New York Times, July 19, 1931, p. XX13. General Broadcasting System's WGBS radio and W2XCR television aired their regular broadcasting debut in New York City on April 26, 1931, with a special demonstration set up in Aeolian Hall at Fifth Avenue and Fifty-fourth Street. Thousands waited to catch a glimpse of the Broadway stars who appeared on the six-inch (15 cm) square image, in an evening event to publicize a weekday programming schedule offering films and live entertainers during the four-hour daily broadcasts. Appearing were boxer Primo Carnera, actors Gertrude Lawrence, Louis Calhern, Frances Upton and Lionel Atwill, WHN announcer Nils Granlund, the Forman Sisters, and a host of others.\\"Radio Talkies Put On Program Basis\\", The New York Times, April 27, 1931, p. 26. CBS's New York City station W2XAB began broadcasting their first regular seven-day-a-week television schedule on July 21, 1931, with a 60-line electromechanical system. The first broadcast included Mayor Jimmy Walker, the Boswell Sisters, Kate Smith, and George Gershwin. The service ended in February 1933.CBS considers it to be an ancestor of WCBS-TV, which first went on the air on July 1, 1941 as one of the first two commercially licensed television stations in the country (the other being the National Broadcasting Company's WNBC). Don Lee Broadcasting's station W6XAO in Los Angeles went on the air in December 1931. Using the UHF spectrum, it broadcast a regular schedule of filmed images every day except Sundays and holidays for several years.W6XAO later moved to VHF Channel 1 before World War II, and to Channel 2 in the post-war television realignment. It was commercially licensed in 1947 as KTSL and is the direct ancestor of current station KCBS-TV. By 1935, low-definition electromechanical television broadcasting had ceased in the United States except for a handful of stations run by public universities that continued to 1939. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) saw television in the continual flux of development with no consistent technical standards, hence all such stations in the U.S. were granted only experimental and non-commercial licenses, hampering television's economic development. Just as importantly, Philo Farnsworth's August 1934 demonstration of an all-electronic system at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia pointed out the direction of television's future. On June 15, 1936, Don Lee Broadcasting began a one-month-long demonstration of high definition (240+ line) television in Los Angeles on W6XAO (later KTSL, now KCBS-TV) with a 300-line image from motion picture film. By October, W6XAO was making daily television broadcasts of films. By 1934 RCA increased the definition to 343 interlaced lines and the frame rate to 30 per second.Alexander B. Magoun, Television: The Life Story of a Technology. Greenwood, p. 65. . On July 7, 1936 RCA and its subsidiary NBC demonstrated in New York City a 343-line electronic television broadcast with live and film segments to its licensees, and made its first public demonstration to the press on November 6. Irregularly scheduled broadcasts continued through 1937 and 1938.\\"Where Is Television Now? \\", Popular Mechanics, August 1938, p. 178. Regularly scheduled electronic broadcasts began in April 1938 in New York (to the second week of June, and resuming in August) and Los Angeles.\\"Telecasts Here and Abroad\\", The New York Times, Drama-Screen-Radio section, April 24, 1938, p.10.\\"Early Birds\\", Time, June 13, 1938.\\"Telecasts to Be Resumed\\", The New York Times, Drama-Screen-Radio section, Aug. 21, 1938, p. 10.Robert L. Pickering, \\"Eight Years of Television in California\\", California ‚Äî Magazine of the Pacific, June 1939. NBC officially began regularly scheduled television broadcasts in New York on April 30, 1939, with a broadcast of the opening of the 1939 New York World's Fair. In 1937 RCA raised the frame definition to 441 lines, and its executives petitioned the FCC for approval of the standard. By June 1939, regularly scheduled 441-line electronic television broadcasts were available in New York City and Los Angeles, and by November on General Electric's station in Schenectady. From May through December 1939, the New York City NBC station (W2XBS) of RCA broadcast twenty to fifty-eight hours of programming per month, Wednesday through Sunday of each week. The programming was 33% news, 29% drama, and 17% educational programming, with an estimated 2,000 receiving sets by the end of the year, and an estimated audience of five to eight thousand. A remote truck could cover outdoor events from up to away from the transmitter, which was located atop the Empire State Building. Coaxial cable was used to cover events at Madison Square Garden. The coverage area for reliable reception was a radius of 40 to from the Empire State Building, an area populated by more than 10,000,000 people (Lohr, 1940). The FCC adopted NTSC television engineering standards on May 2, 1941, calling for 525 lines of vertical resolution, 30 frames per second with interlaced scanning, 60 fields per second, and sound carried by frequency modulation. Sets sold since 1939 that were built for slightly lower resolution could still be adjusted to receive the new standard. (Dunlap, p31). The FCC saw television ready for commercial licensing, and the first such licenses were issued to NBC- and CBS-owned stations in New York on July 1, 1941, followed by Philco's station WPTZ in Philadelphia. In the U.S., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed stations to broadcast advertisements beginning in July 1941, but required public service programming commitments as a requirement for a license. By contrast, the United Kingdom chose a different route, imposing a television license fee on owners of television reception equipment to fund the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), which had public service as part of its Royal Charter. The first official, paid advertising to appear on American commercial television occurred on the afternoon of July 1, 1941, over New York station WNBT (now WNBC) before a baseball game between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Philadelphia Phillies. The announcement for Bulova watches, for which the company paid anywhere from $4.00 to $9.00 (reports vary), displayed a WNBT test pattern modified to look like a clock with the hands showing the time. The Bulova logo, with the phrase \\"Bulova Watch Time\\", was shown in the lower right-hand quadrant of the test pattern while the second hand swept around the dial for one minute.\\"Imagery For Profit\\" R. W. Stewart, The New York Times, July 6, 1941. WNBT/Bulova test pattern After the U.S. entry into World War II, the FCC reduced the required minimum air time for commercial television stations from 15 hours per week to 4 hours. Most TV stations suspended broadcasting; of the ten original television stations only six continued through the war.p.78 Perspectives on Radio and Television: Telecommunication in the United States Routledge, 1998 On the few that remained, programs included entertainment such as boxing and plays, events at Madison Square Garden, and illustrated war news as well as training for air raid wardens and first aid providers. In 1942, there were 5,000 sets in operation, but production of new TVs, radios, and other broadcasting equipment for civilian purposes was suspended from April 1942 to August 1945 (Dunlap). The Philco Predicta, 1958. In the collection of The Children's Museum of Indianapolis By 1947, when there were 40 million radios in the U.S., there were about 44,000 television sets (with probably 30,000 in the New York area). Regular network television broadcasts began on NBC on a three-station network linking New York with the Capital District and Philadelphia in 1944; on the DuMont Television Network in 1946, and on CBS and ABC in 1948. Following the rapid rise of television after the war, the Federal Communications Commission was flooded with applications for television station licenses. With more applications than available television channels, the FCC ordered a freeze on processing station applications in 1948 that remained in effect until April 14, 1952. By 1949, the networks stretched from New York to the Mississippi River, and by 1951 to the West Coast. Commercial color television broadcasts began on CBS in 1951 with a field-sequential color system that was suspended four months later for technical and economic reasons. The television industry's National Television System Committee (NTSC) developed a color television system based on RCA technology that was compatible with existing black and white receivers, and commercial color broadcasts reappeared in 1953. With the widespread adoption of cable across the United States in the 1970s and 80s, terrestrial television broadcasts have been in decline; in 2013 it was estimated that about 7% of US households used an antenna.\\"CEA Study Says Seven Percent of TV Households Use Antennas\\" , '\\"TVTechnology, 30 July 2013\\"Nielsen: Broadcast Reliance Grew in 2012\\" , TVTechnology, 14 January 2013 A slight increase in use began around 2010 due to a switchover to digital terrestrial television broadcasts, which offer pristine image quality over very large areas, and offered an alternate to CATV for cord cutters. Cable television Cable television is a system of broadcasting television programming to paying subscribers via radio frequency (RF) signals transmitted through coaxial cables or light pulses through fiber-optic cables. This contrasts with traditional terrestrial television, in which the television signal is transmitted over the air by radio waves and received by a television antenna attached to the television. FM radio programming, high-speed Internet, telephone service, and similar non-television services may also be provided through these cables. The abbreviation CATV is often used for cable television. It originally stood for Community Access Television or Community Antenna Television, from cable television's origins in 1948: in areas where over-the-air reception was limited by distance from transmitters or mountainous terrain, large \\"community antennas\\" were constructed, and cable was run from them to individual homes. The origins of cable broadcasting are even older as radio programming was distributed by cable in some European cities as far back as 1924. Early cable television was analog, but since the 2000s all cable operators have switched to, or are in the process of switching to, digital cable television. Satellite television =Overview= Satellite television is a system of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually referred to as a satellite dish and a low-noise block downconverter (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television. The most common method of reception is direct-broadcast satellite television (DBSTV), also known as \\"direct to home\\" (DTH). In DBSTV systems, signals are relayed from a direct broadcast satellite on the Ku wavelength and are completely digital. Satellite TV systems formerly used systems known as television receive-only. These systems received analog signals transmitted in the C-band spectrum from FSS type satellites, and required the use of large dishes. Consequently, these systems were nicknamed \\"big dish\\" systems, and were more expensive and less popular. The direct-broadcast satellite television signals were earlier analog signals and later digital signals, both of which require a compatible receiver. Digital signals may include high- definition television (HDTV). Some transmissions and channels are free-to-air or free-to-view, while many other channels are pay television requiring a subscription. In 1945 British science fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke proposed a worldwide communications system that would function by means of three satellites equally spaced apart in earth orbit. This was published in the October 1945 issue of the Wireless World magazine and won him the Franklin Institute's Stuart Ballantine Medal in 1963. The first satellite television signals from Europe to North America were relayed via the Telstar satellite over the Atlantic ocean on July 23, 1962. The signals were received and broadcast in North American and European countries and watched by over 100 million. Launched in 1962, the Relay 1 satellite was the first satellite to transmit television signals from the US to Japan. The first geosynchronous communication satellite, Syncom 2, was launched on July 26, 1963. The world's first commercial communications satellite, called Intelsat I and nicknamed \\"Early Bird\\", was launched into geosynchronous orbit on April 6, 1965. The first national network of television satellites, called Orbita, was created by the Soviet Union in October 1967, and was based on the principle of using the highly elliptical Molniya satellite for rebroadcasting and delivering of television signals to a network of twenty ground downlink stations each equipped with a parabolic antenna in diameter. The first commercial North American satellite to carry television transmissions was Canada's geostationary Anik 1, which was launched on 9 November 1972. ATS-6, the world's first experimental educational and Direct Broadcast Satellite (DBS), was launched on May 30, 1974. It transmitted at 860 MHz using wideband FM modulation and had two sound channels. The transmissions were focused on the Indian subcontinent but experimenters were able to receive the signal in Western Europe using home constructed equipment that drew on UHF television design techniques already in use.Long Distance Television Reception (TV-DX) For the Enthusiast, Roger W. Bunney, In the Soviet Union, the Moskva (or Moscow) system of broadcasting and delivering of TV signals via satellites was launched in 1979. Stationary and mobile downlink stations with parabolic antennas in diameter were receiving signal from Gorizont communication satellites deployed to geostationary orbits. The first in a series of Soviet geostationary satellites to carry Direct-To-Home television, Ekran 1, was launched on October 26, 1976. It used a 714 MHz UHF downlink frequency so that the transmissions could be received with existing UHF television technology rather than microwave technology. =Beginning of the satellite TV industry= In the United States, the satellite television industry developed from the cable television industry as communication satellites were being used to distribute television programming to remote cable television headends. Home Box Office (HBO), Turner Broadcasting System (TBS), and Christian Broadcasting Network (CBN, later The Family Channel) were among the first to use satellite television to deliver programming. Taylor Howard of San Andreas, California became the first person to receive C-band satellite signals with his home- built system in 1976. PBS, a non-profit public broadcasting service, began to distribute its television programming by satellite in 1978.Public Service Broadcasting in the Age of Globalization, Editors: Indrajit Banerjee, Kalinga Seneviratne. On October 18, 1979, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) began allowing people to have home satellite earth stations without a federal government license. The front cover of the 1979 Neiman-Marcus Christmas catalogue featured the first home satellite TV stations on sale for $36,500. The dishes were nearly in diameter and were remote-controlled. The price went down by half soon after that, but there were only eight more channels. The Society for Private and Commercial Earth Stations (SPACE), an organisation that represented consumers and satellite TV system owners was established in 1980. Early satellite television systems were not very popular due to their expense and large dish size. The satellite television dishes of the systems in the late 1970s and early 1980s were in diameter, made of fibreglass or solid aluminum or steel,Ku-Band Satellite TV: Theory, Installation and Repair. Frank Baylin et al. and in the United States cost more than $5,000, sometimes as much as $10,000. Programming sent from ground stations was relayed from eighteen satellites in geostationary orbit located above the Earth. =TVRO/C-band satellite era= By 1980, satellite television was well established in the USA and Europe. On April 26, 1982, the first satellite channel in the UK, Satellite Television Ltd. (later Sky1), was launched. Its signals were transmitted from the ESA's Orbital Test Satellites. Between 1981 and 1985, TVRO systems' sales rates increased as prices fell. Advances in receiver technology and the use of Gallium Arsenide FET technology enabled the use of smaller dishes. 500,000 systems, some costing as little as $2000, were sold in the US in 1984. Dishes pointing to one satellite were even cheaper. People in areas without local broadcast stations or cable television service could obtain good-quality reception with no monthly fees. The large dishes were a subject of much consternation, as many people considered them eyesores, and in the US most condominiums, neighborhoods, and other homeowner associations tightly restricted their use, except in areas where such restrictions were illegal. These restrictions were altered in 1986 when the Federal Communications Commission ruled all of them illegal. A municipality could require a property owner to relocate the dish if it violated other zoning restrictions, such as a setback requirement, but could not outlaw their use. The necessity of these restrictions would slowly decline as the dishes got smaller. Originally, all channels were broadcast in the clear (ITC) because the equipment necessary to receive the programming was too expensive for consumers. With the growing number of TVRO systems, the program providers and broadcasters had to scramble their signal and develop subscription systems. In October 1984, the U.S. Congress passed the Cable Communications Policy Act of 1984, which gave those using TVRO systems the right to receive signals for free unless they were scrambled, and required those who did scramble to make their signals available for a reasonable fee. Since cable channels could prevent reception by big dishes, other companies had an incentive to offer competition. In January 1986, HBO began using the now- obsolete VideoCipher II system to encrypt their channels. Other channels uses less secure television encryption systems. The scrambling of HBO was met with much protest from owners of big-dish systems, most of which had no other option at the time for receiving such channels, claiming that clear signals from cable channels would be difficult to receive. Eventually HBO allowed dish owners to subscribe directly to their service for $12.95 per month, a price equal to or higher than what cable subscribers were paying, and required a descrambler to be purchased for $395. This led to the attack on HBO's transponder Galaxy 1 by John R. MacDougall in April 1986. One by one, all commercial channels followed HBO's lead and began scrambling their channels. The Satellite Broadcasting and Communications Association SBCA was founded on December 2, 1986 as the result of a merger between SPACE and the Direct Broadcast Satellite Association (DBSA). Videocipher II used analog scrambling on its video signal and Data Encryption Standard based encryption on its audio signal. VideoCipher II was defeated, and there was a black market for descrambler devices, which were initially sold as \\"test\\" devices. = Late 1980s and 1990s to present = DBS satellite dishes. By 1987, nine channels were scrambled, but 99 others were available free-to-air. While HBO initially charged a monthly fee of $19.95, soon it became possible to unscramble all channels for $200 a year. Dish sales went down from 600,000 in 1985 to 350,000 in 1986, but pay television services were seeing dishes as something positive since some people would never have cable service, and the industry was starting to recover as a result. Scrambling also led to the development of pay-per-view events. On November 1, 1988, NBC began scrambling its C-band signal but left its Ku band signal unencrypted in order for affiliates to not lose viewers who could not see their advertising. Most of the two million satellite dish users in the United States still used C-band. ABC and CBS were considering scrambling, though CBS was reluctant due to the number of people unable to receive local network affiliates. The piracy on satellite television networks in the US led to the introduction of the Cable Television Consumer Protection and Competition Act of 1992. This legislation enabled anyone caught engaging in signal theft to be fined up to $50,000 and to be sentenced to a maximum of two years in prison. A repeat offender can be fined up to $100,000 and be imprisoned for up to five years. Satellite television had also developed in Europe but it initially used low power communication satellites and it required dish sizes of over . On December 11, 1988 Luxembourg launched Astra 1A, the first satellite to provide medium power satellite coverage to Western Europe. This was one of the first medium-powered satellites, transmitting signals in Ku band and allowing reception with small dishes (90 cm). The launch of Astra beat the winner of the UK's state Direct Broadcast Satellite licence holder, British Satellite Broadcasting, to the market. In the US in the early 1990s, four large cable companies launched PrimeStar, a direct broadcasting company using medium power satellite. The relatively strong transmissions allowed the use of smaller (90 cm) dishes. Its popularity declined with the 1994 launch of the Hughes DirecTV and Dish Network satellite television systems. On March 4, 1996 EchoStar introduced Digital Sky Highway (Dish Network) using the EchoStar 1 satellite. EchoStar launched a second satellite in September 1996 to increase the number of channels available on Dish Network to 170. These systems provided better pictures and stereo sound on 150-200 video and audio channels, and allowed small dishes to be used. This greatly reduced the popularity of TVRO systems. In the mid-1990s, channels began moving their broadcasts to digital television transmission using the DigiCipher conditional access system. In addition to encryption, the widespread availability, in the US, of DBS services such as PrimeStar and DirecTV had been reducing the popularity of TVRO systems since the early 1990s. Signals from DBS satellites (operating in the more recent Ku band) are higher in both frequency and power (due to improvements in the solar panels and energy efficiency of modern satellites) and therefore require much smaller dishes than C-band, and the digital modulation methods now used require less signal strength at the receiver than analog modulation methods.Mirabito, M.,& Morgenstern, B. (2004). Satellites: Operations and Applications. The New Communication Technologies (fifth edition). Burlington: Focal Press. Each satellite also can carry up to 32 transponders in the Ku band, but only 24 in the C band, and several digital subchannels can be multiplexed (MCPC) or carried separately (SCPC) on a single transponder. Advances in noise reduction due to improved microwave technology and semiconductor materials have also had an effect. However, one consequence of the higher frequencies used for DBS services is rain fade where viewers lose signal during a heavy downpour. C-band satellite television signals are less prone to rain fade. Internet television Internet television (Internet TV), (online television) or IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is the digital distribution of television content via the Internet as opposed to traditional systems like terrestrial, cable and satellite, although internet itself is received by terrestrial, cable or satellite methods. Internet television is a general term that covers the delivery of television shows and other video content over the Internet by video streaming technology, typically by major traditional television broadcasters. Internet television should not to be confused with Smart TV, IPTV or with Web TV. Smart television refers to the TV set that has an inbuilt operating system. Internet Protocol television (IPTV) is one of the emerging Internet television technology standards for use by television broadcasters. Web television is a term used for programs created by a wide variety of companies and individuals for broadcast on Internet TV. Television sets A television set, also called a television receiver, television, TV set, TV, or telly, is a device that combines a tuner, display, and speakers for the purpose of viewing television. Introduced in the late 1920s in mechanical form, television sets became a popular consumer product after World War II in electronic form, using cathode ray tubes. The addition of color to broadcast television after 1953 further increased the popularity of television sets in the 1960s, and an outdoor antenna became a common feature of suburban homes. The ubiquitous television set became the display device for the first recorded media in the 1970s, such as VHS and later DVD, as well as for early home computers and videogame consoles. In the late 2000s flat panel television incorporating liquid-crystal displays largely replaced cathode ray tubes. Modern flat panel TVs are typically capable of high-definition display (720p, 1080p or 2160p) and can also play content from a USB device.

Television usage in the western world skyrocketed after World War II with the lifting of the manufacturing freeze, war-related technological advances, the drop in television prices caused by mass production, increased leisure time, and additional disposable income. While only 0.5% of U.S. households had a television in 1946, 55.7% had one in 1954, and 90% by 1962.Number of TV Households in America, Television History: The First 75 Years. In Britain, there were 15,000 television households in 1947, 1.4 million in 1952, and 15.1 million by 1968. By the late 1960s and early 1970s, color television had come into wide use. In Britain, BBC1, BBC2 and ITV were regularly broadcasting in color by 1969. By the late 2000s, CRT display technology was largely supplanted worldwide by flat-panel displays such as LCD. Flat-panel television, especially LCD, has become the dominant form of television since the early 2010s.  Technological innovations  The first national live television broadcast in the U.S. took place on September 4, 1951 when President Harry Truman's speech at the Japanese Peace Treaty Conference in San Francisco was transmitted over AT&T;'s transcontinental cable and microwave radio relay system to broadcast stations in local markets.\\"Truman to Be Televised In First National Hook-Up\\", The New York Times, September 4, 1951, p. 2.\\"Television Highlights\\", The Washington Post, September 4, 1951, p. B13.\\"Coast to Coast Television\\" (CBS advertisement), The Wall Street Journal, September 4, 1951, p. 9. The first live coast-to-coast commercial television broadcast in the U.S. took place on November 18, 1951 during the premiere of CBS's See It Now, which showed a split-screen view of the Brooklyn Bridge in New York City and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. Eurovision Song Contest held yearly from 1956 by the European Broadcasting Union was launched, among other goals, with the aim to make technical improvements in the field of simultaneous sharing of TV signals across main national European broadcasters, a technical challenge by that time. It is the longest-running annual international televised music competition. In 1958, the CBC completed the longest television network in the world, from Sydney, Nova Scotia to Victoria, British Columbia. Reportedly, the first continuous live broadcast of a \\"breaking\\" news story in the world was conducted by the CBC during the Springhill mining disaster, which began on October 23, 1958. The development of cable television and satellite television in the 1970s allowed for more channels and encouraged companies to target programming toward specific audiences. It also enabled the rise of subscription television channels, such as Home Box Office (HBO) and Showtime in the U.S., and Sky Television in the U.K.  Television pioneers  Important people in the development and contributions of TV technology. * Manfred von Ardenne * John Logie Baird * Alan Blumlein * Walter Bruch (PAL television) * Guillermo Gonz√°lez Camarena * Alan Archibald Campbell-Swinton * Karl Ferdinand Braun * Allen B.

It is a collection of 400 heroic poems about kings, wars and public life, of which two are lost and a few have survived into the modern age in fragments. The collected poems were composed by 157 poets, of which 14 are anonymous and at least 10 were poetess. This anthology has been variously dated between 1st century BCE and 5th century CE, with Kamil Zvelebil ‚Äì a Tamil literature scholar, dating predominantly all of the poems of Purananuru sometime between 2nd and 5th century CE. While few poems are dated to the period of 1st century BCE. The Purananuru anthology is diverse. Of its 400 poems, 138 praise 43 kings ‚Äì 18 from the Chera dynasty (present day Kerala), 13 Chola dynasty kings, and 12 Early Pandyan dynasty kings. Another 141 poems praise 48 chieftains. These panegyric poems recite their heroic deeds, as well as another 109 poems that recite deeds of anonymous heroes likely of older Tamil oral tradition. Some poems are gnomic in nature, which have attracted unrealistic attempts to read an ethical message, states Zvelebil. The poetry largely focuses on war, means of war such as horses, heroic deeds, widowhood, hardships, impermanence, and other effects of wars between kingdoms based along the rivers Kaveri, Periyar and Vaigai. The Purananuru is the most important Tamil corpus of Sangam era courtly poems, and it has been a source of information on the political and social history of ancient Tamil Nadu. According to Hart and Heifetz, the Purananuru provides a view of the Tamil society before large scale Indo-Aryan influences affected it. The life of the Tamils of this era revolved around the king, emphasized the purity of women and placed limitations of the rights of widows. Further, the compilation suggests that the ancient Tamils had a caste system called kuti. The anthology is almost entirely a secular treatise on the ancient Tamil thought on kingship, the constant state of wars within old Tamil speaking regions, the bravery of heroes and the ferocious nature of this violence. According to Amritha Shenoy, the Purananuru poems eulogize war and describe \\"loyalty, courage, honor\\" as the virtues of warriors. In contrast, Sivaraja Pillai cautions that the historical and literary value of Purananuru poems may be limited because the poems were not a perfect work of art but one of compulsion from impoverished poets too eager to praise one king or another, seeking patrons through exaggeration and flattery rather than objectivity.John Marr (1958), The eight Tamil anthologies with special reference to Purananuru and Pattirruppattu, SOAS, University of London, page 9; The Chronology Of The Early Tamils, KN Sivaraja Pillai, University of Madras, page 18 The Purananuru poems use words, phrases, and metaphors that suggest the ancient Tamil society interacted with other parts of the Indian subcontinent. Examples include references to the Himalaya of \\"immeasurable heights\\", Shiva, Vishnu, four Vedas, Ramayana, rivers and other aspects. Anthology Among the eight Sangam anthologies, Purananuru and Pathitrupathu are concerned with life outside family - kings, wars, greatness, generosity, ethics and philosophy. While Pathitrupathu is limited to the glory of Chera kings in 108 verses, Purananuru contains an assortment of themes in three hundred ninety seven poems. Of the original 400 poems, two have been lost, and some poems miss several lines.Hart 1999, p. xvi Structure and content There are 400 poems in Purananuru including the invocation poem. Each poem measures anywhere between 4 and 40 lines. Poems 267 and 268 are lost, and some of the poems exist only in fragment. The author of 14 poems remain unknown. The remaining poems were written by 157 poets. Of the poets who wrote these poems, there are men and women, kings and paupers. The oldest book of annotations found so far has annotations and commentary on the first 266 poems. The commentator Nachinarkiniyar, of the eleventh‚Äìtwelfth century Tamil Nadu, has written a complete commentary on all the poems. =Subject matter= The Purananuru poems deal with the puram aspect of the Sangam literature, that is war, politics and public life. Many poems praise kings and chieftains. Some of the poems are in the form of elegies in tribute to a fallen hero. These poems exhibit outpourings of affection and emotions. Purananuru is notable for three features: the king and his believed powers over the climate and environment (rains, sunshine, successful crops), the ancient Tamil belief in the power of women's purity, namely karpu (chastity), and the ancient system of caste (kuti, kudi) that existed in Tamil kingdoms independent of any Indo- Aryan influence from north India. According to Hart and Heifetz, the Purananuru content is organized in the following way (poem sequence number in brackets):Hart 1999, p. 349, xviRav 2003, p. 126 * Invocation to Shiva (1) * Praise of kings (2-64) * Death of the king, messengers, bards, bragging king, captive treatment, odds, speed of war, warriors, singing poets, poor poet and generous kings (65-173) * Ethical and moral poems (182-195) * Kings who were not generous to poets (196‚Äì211) * Death of kings, helplessness of widows, youth versus old age, cattle raids, memorial stone, drinking, combat (213‚Äì282) * War (283‚Äì314) * Kings who were generous to the poor (315‚Äì335) * Impermanence of life, the inevitability of death (336‚Äì367) * Low-caste drummer asking king for gifts (368‚Äì400) =Authors= The collected poems were composed by 157 poets, of which 14 are anonymous and at least 10 were poetess. Some of the authors of the poems, such as Kapilar and Nakkirar, have also written poems that are part of other anthologies. =Structure= There seems to be some definite structure to the order of the poems in Purananuru. The poems at the beginning of the book deal with the three major kings Chola, Chera and Pandya of ancient Tamil Nadu.Hart 1999, pp. xvi-xviii The middle portion is on the lesser kings and the Velir chieftains, who were feudatories of these three major kingdoms, with a short intervening section (poems 182 - 195) of didactic poems. The final portion deals with the general scenery of war and the effect of warfare. =Landscapes= Just as the akam (subjective) poems are classified into seven thinais or landscapes based on the mood of the poem, the Tamil prosodical tradition mentioned in the ancient Tamil grammatical treatise Tolkappiyam also classifies puram (objective) poems into seven thinais based on the subject of the poems. These are vetchi, when the king provokes war by attacking and stealing the cattle of his enemy; vanchi, when the king invades the enemy territory; uzhingai, when the king lays a siege of the enemy's fortress; thumbai, when the two armies meet on a battlefield; vaakai, when the king is victorious; paataan, when the poet praises the king on his victory; and kanchi, when the poet sings on the fragility of human life. The Purananuru does not, however, follow this system. The colophons accompanying each poem name a total of eleven thinais. From the subject matter of the poems they accompany, each can be said to represent the following themes: * Vetchi * Karanthai * Vanchi * Nochchi * Thumpai * Vaakai * Kanchi * Paadaan * Kaikkilai * Perunthinai * Pothuviyal The Kaikkilai and Perunthinai are traditionally associated with akam poetry. In Purananuru, they occur in the context of the familiar puram landscape of warfare. Thus songs 83, 84 and 85 are classified to belong to the kaikkilai thinai, which denotes unrequited love, and describe a noblewoman's love for King Cholan Poravai Kopperunarkilli. Similarly, songs 143 to 147 are classified as perunthinai or perunkilai thinai, which denotes unsuitable love, and deal with King Pekan's abandonment of his wife. Pothuviyal is described in commentaries as a general thinai used for poems that cannot be classified in any other manner but, in the context of Purananuru, is used almost exclusively for didactic verse and elegies or laments for dead heroes. =Realism= Purananuru songs exhibit a unique realism and immediacy not frequently found in classical literature. The nature and the subject of the poems lend us to believe that poets did not write these poems on events that happened years prior, rather they wrote (or sang) them on impulse in situ. Some of the poems are conversational in which the poet pleads, begs, chides or praises the king. One such example is poem 46. The poet Kovur Kizhaar address the Chola king Killivalavan to save the lives of the children of a defeated enemy who are about to be executed by being trampled under an elephant. The poet says, \\"‚Ä¶ O king, you belong to the heritage of kings who sliced their own flesh to save the life of a pigeon, look at these children; they are so na√Øve of their plight that they have stopped crying to look at the swinging trunk of the elephant in amusement. Have pity on them‚Ä¶\\" The almost impressionistic picture the poem paints cannot be anything but by someone who is witness to the events present in the poem. The second poem by Mudinagarayar addresses the Chera king Uthayan Cheralaathan and praises him for his feeding the armies at the Kurukshetra war. This is an obvious anachronism suggesting a king of the early common era Tamil country had a role to play in the battle of the Mahabharata epic. Based on this one poem, there have been attempts at dating the Purananuru poems to around 1000 BCE or older. Historical source Each Purananuru poem has a colophon attached to it giving the authorship and subject matter of the poem, the name of the king or chieftain to whom the poem relates and the occasion which called forth the eulogy are also found. It is from these colophons and rarely from the texts of the poems themselves, that we gather the names of many kings and chieftains and the poets and poetesses patronised by them. The task of reducing these names to an ordered scheme in which the different generations of contemporaries can be marked off one another has not been easy. To add to the confusions, some historians have even denounced these colophons as later additions and untrustworthy as historical documents. A careful study of the synchronisation between the kings, chieftains and the poets suggested by these colophons indicates that this body of literature reflect occurrences within a period of four or five continuous generations at the most, a period of 120 or 150 years. Any attempt at extracting a systematic chronology and data from these poems should be aware of the casual nature of these poems and the wide difference between the purposes of the anthologist who collected these poems and the historian‚Äôs attempts are arriving at a continuous history. There have been unsuccessful attempts at dating the poems of Purananuru based on the mention of the mythical Mahabharata war. A more reliable source for the period of these poems is based on the mentions one finds on the foreign trade and presence of Greek and Roman merchants in the port of Musiri (poem 343), which give us a date of between 200 BCE to 150 CE for the period of these poems. This is further strengthened by the mention of a reference to Ramayana in poem 378, and a reference to Maurya in poem 175, which indicates a late date of about 187 BCE. A combination of these two considerations would indicate a composition date range during the 2nd century BCE. Ramayana Reference The earliest reference to the story of the Ramayana in Tamil literature is found in the Purananuru 378, attributed to the poet UnPodiPasunKudaiyar, written in praise of the Chola king IIamchetchenni. The poem makes the analogy of a poet receiving royal gifts and that worn by the relatives of the poet as being unworthy for their status, to the event in the Ramayana, where Sita drops her jewels when abducted by Ravana and these jewels being picked up red-faced monkeys who delightfully wore the ornaments. This seems to indicate that the story of the Ramayana was familiar in the Tamil lands before the Kamba Ramayanam of the 12th century CE. Publishing in modern times thumb U. V. Swaminatha Iyer (1855-1942 CE) resurrected the first three epics and Sangam literature from the appalling neglect and wanton destruction of centuries.Lal 2001, pp. 4255-4256 He reprinted the literature present in the palm leaf form to paper books.M.S. 1994, p. 194 He published Purananuru for the first time in 1894. Ramaswami Mudaliar, a Tamil scholar, first gave him the palm leaves of Civaka Cintamani to study. Being the first time, Swaminatha Iyer had to face many difficulties in terms of interpreting, finding the missing leaves, textual errors and unfamiliar terms.

His mother won a Vauxhall Chevette in a national newspaper competition when he was ten; Having never learned to drive, she instead opted to take the prize in cash instead and spent it buying her son a drum kit. After taking lessons from local jazz musician Al Reed, Townshend's stage debut was made in March 1977, aged just 12. By the end of the 1970s, Townshend had graduated to playing in clubs with college bands. Townshend started an apprenticeship with the local bus company, the West Midlands Passenger Transport Executive, Fuzz worked on buses at the PTE's Dudley garage. During his time at Dudley, he recorded his first two John Peel Sessions for BBC Radio 1 and released his first single which made its way into the NME indie charts. Music Townshend joined former Beat singer Ranking Roger and his band General Public, which later toured the USA under the guise of 'Ranking Roger'. Local indie band Pop Will Eat Itself noticed him drumming with local acts and asked him to join. Townshend spent the next four and a half years drumming for the band, during which time they had successes in both the UK single and album charts and toured North America with Nine Inch Nails. Townshend started playing drums for the dance music outfit, Bentley Rhythm Ace. His first solo release, \\"Hello Darlin\\", was released in 1996, and he eventually signed to Echo Records, in July 1997.

Writing career and garage Townshend's first job in journalism was for Practical Classics, going on to become Technical Editor until March 2011, when he decided to go freelance, as well as starting a new classic car restoration business, Westgate Classics. In 2014, Townshend founded Classic Friendly Ltd, a network of classic car-friendly garages, offering comprehensive safety inspections for MoT test-exempt classic cars as well as standardised servicing regimes. He is also about to launch an inspection scheme for auction and online auction cars under the same CFL umbrella. In April 2019, a message posted on the Facebook page Classic Friendly Ltd confirmed that Townshend had resigned from the business around one year earlier, and that he had \\"no further dealings or influence with its direction or trading.\\" In the summer of 2016, Fuzz left Westgate Classics to set up a new garage, To-Ta Classics Ltd., in Oldbury, West Midlands. In 2018, To-Ta changed its name to SOS Workshop Ltd. TV career A TV production company invited Townshend to do a screen test audition for a new show, Car SOS, held at his garage.

History The music was played over both the opening and closing credits of the original series. The opening credits begin with the now-famous \\"where no man has gone before\\" monologue recited by series star William Shatner, accompanied by an opening fanfare. The main theme begins, punctuated at several points by the Enterprise flying toward and past the camera with a \\"whoosh\\" sound for dramatic effect, created vocally by Courage himself. A slightly longer version of the theme, minus the eight-note fanfare, was played over the closing credits, which were overlaid on a series of stills from various episodes. Courage has said his inspiration for the main part of the theme was the Richard Whiting song \\"Beyond the Blue Horizon,\\" giving him the idea for a song which was a \\"long thing that...keeps going out into space...over a fast moving accompaniment.\\" The unaired pilot \\"The Cage\\" used a wordless rendition of the melody line, sung by soprano Loulie Jean Norman with flute and organ, over an orchestral arrangement. When originally composed (and as heard in \\"The Cage\\"), Courage had Norman's vocalizations and the various instruments mixed equally to produce what Courage described as a unique \\"'what is that that I'm hearing?' sound.\\" According to Courage, however, Gene Roddenberry had the mix changed to bring up the female vocal, after which Courage felt the theme sounded like a soprano solo. Finally, for the third season it was remixed again, this time emphasizing the organ. The first several episodes, without any vocals, was a concerto-like solo of an electric violin playing the melodic line. Norman's vocal was restored for the remainder of the season. Producer Herbert Solow recalled that Norman had been hired under a Screen Actors Guild agreement and that she would receive rerun fees for her part in the theme. For the second season onwards, her vocalization was dropped from the theme. Solow regretted the choice and composer Courage was not informed until twenty-seven years later. The unaired version of the second pilot episode used an entirely different main title theme (Star Trek was the first series in American television history for which a network, NBC in this case, requested and paid for a second pilot episode), also composed by Courage. This version of the theme never aired for when the second pilot was re-edited for broadcast it received the series standard titles and the original theme, minus the William Shatner opening narration (this was changed for home video) . In 2006, CBS began syndicating a \\"remastered\\" version of the series with numerous changes, including a re-recording of the theme music, which was used for all episodes of the series. Elin Carlson, a professional singer and lifetime Star Trek fan, recorded the replacement for Norman's vocalization. Over time, the show's theme music has become immediately recognizable, even by many people who have never seen the program. Portions of the original theme have been used in subsequent Star Trek series and motion pictures. For 1979's Star Trek: The Motion Picture, scored by Jerry Goldsmith, Alexander Courage provided additional cues featuring his theme, where it softly accompanies the \\"captain's log\\" scenes. Dennis McCarthy reused the original theme's fanfare when he reworked Goldsmith's main theme for use as Star Trek: The Next Generation's theme music, where the fanfare precedes Goldsmith's theme. Most of the subsequent Star Trek motion pictures' main title themes started with the fanfare before segueing into music composed specially for the given film. 2009's Star Trek broke with this tradition; instead, composer Michael Giacchino used the opening notes sparingly in the movie, but featured an arrangement of the theme in the film's end credits. All the Star Trek feature films to date use the fanfare at some point.  Lyrics  Without Courage's knowledge, Roddenberry wrote lyrics to the theme ‚Äî not in the expectation that they would ever be sung, or indeed ever be made publicly available, but so that he could be officially registered as the lyricist of the theme and hence claim half the performance royalties. Although there was never any litigation, Courage later commented that he considered Roddenberry's conduct unethical. Roddenberry was quoted as responding, \\"Hey, I have to get some money somewhere. I'm sure not gonna get it out of the profits of Star Trek.\\". These lyrics were published in the book The Making of Star Trek by Roddenberry and Stephen Whitfield, and were featured in an issue of the DC Comics Star Trek comic book, \\"performed\\" by the character Uhura. Series associate producer Robert Justman noted that work on the film Doctor Dolittle kept Courage from working on more than two episodes of the first season. Justman claims he was unable to convince Courage to return for the second season and believed that Courage lost enthusiasm for the series due to the \\"royalty\\" issue. This is factually incorrect as Courage did work on the show before the show's second season, on June 16, 1967 he conducted thirty minutes of library music (much of it newly composed), including a new arrangement of the Star Trek theme. He returned again for the third season to score the episodes \\"The Enterprise Incident\\" and \\"Plato's Stepchildren\\". Other recordings and uses * Contrary to many claims, part of the theme was not copied for use in the television series Twelve O'Clock High. While there is a recurring musical motif by Dominic Frontiere that sounds quite similar to eight notes of the Star Trek theme, that motif is appeared as early as the fifth episode of that series (\\"Climate of Doubt\\") which aired October 23, 1964, two months before the Star Trek pilot episode \\"The Cage\\" commenced production. As such, it is not the Trek theme as it pre-dates the scoring of that pilot. *In the 1970s, Nichelle Nichols, who portrayed Uhura on the original series, recorded a disco version of the song with lyrics different from Roddenberry's. * Van McCoy released an instrumental disco version of the song on his 1976 album The Real McCoy. * Todd Rundgren's band, Utopia, released a disco version of the song on their 1976 album, Disco Jets. * Jazz trumpeter Maynard Ferguson recorded a fusion version of the tune with his big band, first released on his Conquistador album in January 1977. This recording was later used as the opening theme for The Larry King Show on the Mutual Radio Network, and was so popular that King would occasionally play the entire song at the end of the show. * The theme was used as the breakaway music for the aircraft carrier for many years, until it was replaced by the theme from Star Trek: The Motion Picture. * In 1992, Austrian dance act Edelweiss had a hit with the number \\"Starship Edelweiss,\\" which used the theme as its melodic base. * In the movie Wayne's World, Garth Algar (Dana Carvey) is heard whistling the Star Trek theme while lying on top of the hood of an AMC Pacer. While looking at the stars, he says, \\"Sometimes I wish I could boldly go where no one's gone before.\\" * At the 2005 Emmys, Shatner and operatic singer Frederica von Stade performed a live version of the theme, with Shatner reciting the opening monologue and von Stade singing the wordless melody line. * The 2003 release Magical Moods of the Theremin, by lounge act Project: Pimento, includes the theme performed with lyrics, and a theremin. (The title theme recordings for the TV series are often erroneously believed to feature a theremin.) * In the 2006 film RV, Jeff Daniels's character has an RV with a horn that uses a snippet of the theme. * In 2007, some TV ads for the Hummer H3 featured the theme recording used in the second and third seasons. * In 2009, the theme was used as the wake-up call for the crew of mission STS-125 aboard the space shuttle Atlantis. * On March 7, 2011, Shatner, in character as Kirk, voiced a wake-up call for the crew of STS-133 in the Space Shuttle Discovery on its final day docked to the International Space Station. His call at 0723 UTC, reminiscent of the over-voicing on the original Star Trek series, was backed by the theme as he said, \\"Space, the final frontier. These have been the voyages of the Space Shuttle Discovery. Her 30 year mission: To seek out new science. To build new outposts. To bring nations together on the final frontier. To boldly go, and do, what no spacecraft has done before.\\"'Star Trek' moment for Earth-bound shuttle Discovery. space-travel.com, March 7, 2011, accessed March 9, 2011 * Tenacious D has covered the theme live, with the original lyrics, on several occasions. * In at least one episode of the Big Bang Theory, Sheldon is seen playing the theme song on a theremin.

This is a system of elliptic differential operators on vector bundles, generalizing the de Rham complex constructed from smooth differential forms which appears in the original Lefschetz fixed-point theorem. Formulation The idea is to find the correct replacement for the Lefschetz number, which in the classical result is an integer counting the correct contribution of a fixed point of a smooth mapping f\\\\colon M \\\\to M. Intuitively, the fixed points are the points of intersection of the graph of f with the diagonal (graph of the identity mapping) in M\\\\times M, and the Lefschetz number thereby becomes an intersection number. The Atiyah‚ÄìBott theorem is an equation in which the LHS must be the outcome of a global topological (homological) calculation, and the RHS a sum of the local contributions at fixed points of f. Counting codimensions in M\\\\times M, a transversality assumption for the graph of f and the diagonal should ensure that the fixed point set is zero-dimensional. Assuming M a closed manifold should ensure then that the set of intersections is finite, yielding a finite summation as the RHS of the expected formula. Further data needed relates to the elliptic complex of vector bundles E_j, namely a bundle map :\\\\varphi_j \\\\colon f^{-1}(E_j) \\\\to E_j for each j, such that the resulting maps on sections give rise to an endomorphism of an elliptic complex T. Such an endomorphism T has Lefschetz number :L(T), which by definition is the alternating sum of its traces on each graded part of the homology of the elliptic complex. The form of the theorem is then :L(T) = \\\\sum_x \\\\left(\\\\sum_j (-1)^j \\\\mathrm{trace}\\\\, \\\\varphi_{j,x}\\\\right)/\\\\delta(x). Here trace \\\\varphi_{j,x} means the trace of \\\\varphi_{j} at a fixed point x of f, and \\\\delta(x) is the determinant of the endomorphism I -Df at x, with Df the derivative of f (the non-vanishing of this is a consequence of transversality). The outer summation is over the fixed points x, and the inner summation over the index j in the elliptic complex. Specializing the Atiyah‚ÄìBott theorem to the de Rham complex of smooth differential forms yields the original Lefschetz fixed-point formula. A famous application of the Atiyah‚ÄìBott theorem is a simple proof of the Weyl character formula in the theory of Lie groups. History The early history of this result is entangled with that of the Atiyah‚ÄìSinger index theorem. There was other input, as is suggested by the alternate name Woods Hole fixed-point theorem that was used in the past (referring properly to the case of isolated fixed points). A 1964 meeting at Woods Hole brought together a varied group: > Eichler started the interaction between fixed-point theorems and automorphic > forms. Shimura played an important part in this development by explaining > this to Bott at the Woods Hole conference in 1964. As Atiyah puts it:Collected Papers III p.2. > [at the conference]...Bott and I learnt of a conjecture of Shimura > concerning a generalization of the Lefschetz formula for holomorphic maps. > After much effort we convinced ourselves that there should be a general > formula of this type [...]; . and they were led to a version for elliptic complexes. In the recollection of William Fulton, who was also present at the conference, the first to produce a proof was Jean-Louis Verdier. Proofs In the context of algebraic geometry, the statement applies for smooth and proper varieties over an algebraically closed field.

Excellent resource for 20th century plant breeding. Standard reference for evolution and early history. About 95% of wheat produced worldwide is common wheat; it is the most widely grown of all crops and the cereal with the highest monetary yield.  Nomenclature and taxonomy of wheat and its cultivars Numerous forms of wheat have evolved under human selection. This diversity has led to confusion in the naming of wheats, with names based on both genetic and morphological characteristics. For more information, see the taxonomy of wheat. = List of the common cultivars = * 'Albimonte' * 'Manital' Evolution Bread wheat is an allohexaploid (an allopolyploid with six sets of chromosomes: two sets from each of three different species). Of the six sets of chromosomes, two come from Triticum urartu (einkorn wheat) and two from Aegilops speltoides. This spontaneous hybridisation created the tetraploid species Triticum turgidum (durum wheat) 580,000‚Äì820,000 years ago. The last two sets of chromosomes came from wild goat-grass Aegilops tauschii 230,000‚Äì430,000 years ago. Free-threshing wheat is closely related to spelt. As with spelt, genes contributed from Aegilops tauschii give bread wheat greater cold hardiness than most wheats, and it is cultivated throughout the world's temperate regions. History Common wheat was first domesticated in Western Asia during the early Holocene, and spread from there to North Africa, Europe and East Asia in the prehistoric period. Naked wheats (including Triticum aestivum/durum/turgidum) were found in Roman burial sites ranging from 100BCE to 300CE . Wheat first reached North America with Spanish missions in the 16th century, but North America's role as a major exporter of grain dates from the colonization of the prairies in the 1870s. As grain exports from Russia ceased in the First World War, grain production in Kansas doubled. Worldwide, bread wheat has proved well adapted to modern industrial baking, and has displaced many of the other wheat, barley, and rye species that were once commonly used for bread making, particularly in Europe. Plant breeding A field of wheat in Deggendorf, Germany Modern wheat varieties have been selected for short stems, the result of RHt dwarfing genes that reduce the plant's sensitivity to gibberellic acid, a plant hormone that lengthens cells. RHt genes were introduced to modern wheat varieties in the 1960s by Norman Borlaug from Norin 10 cultivars of wheat grown in Japan. Short stems are important because the application of high levels of chemical fertilizers would otherwise cause the stems to grow too high, resulting in lodging (collapse of the stems). Stem heights are also even, which is important for modern harvesting techniques. Other forms of common wheat Ears of compact wheat Compact wheats (e.g., club wheat Triticum compactum, but in India T. sphaerococcum) are closely related to common wheat, but have a much more compact ear. Their shorter rachis segments lead to spikelets packed closer together. Compact wheats are often regarded as subspecies rather than species in their own right (thus T. aestivum subsp. compactum).

The legal rights of the signatories in reference to the material is thereafter subject to the allowances and restrictions stated in the release, and also possibly in exchange for compensation paid to the photographed. A model release is not needed for most photograph publication because of freedom of speech rights (which vary by country.) A model release is needed for publication where personality rights or privacy rights would otherwise be infringed. No release is required for publication, as news, of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a public place. In general, no release is required for publication of a photo taken of an identifiable person when the person is in a public space unless the use is for trade or direct commercial use, which is defined as promoting a product, service, or idea.FAQ about privacy and libel ASMP.org Publication of a photo of an identifiable person, even if taken when the person is in a public place, that implies endorsement, without a model release signed by that person, can result in civil liability for whoever publishes the photograph.Legal rights of photographers COB.org Note that no model release is needed for the act of taking the photograph. Rather, if needed, the model release applies to the publication of the photograph. Liability rests solely with the publisher, except under special conditions. The photographer is typically not the publisher of the photograph, but usually licenses the photograph to someone else to publish. It is typical for the photographer to obtain the model release not merely because they are present at the time and can get it, but also because it gives them more opportunity to license the photograph later to a party who wishes to publish it. Note that the issue of model release forms and liability waivers is a legal area related to privacy and is separate from copyright. Also, the need for model releases pertains to public use of the photos: i.e., publishing them, commercially or not. The act of taking a photo of someone in a public setting without a model release, or of viewing or non-commercially showing such a photo in private, generally does not create legal exposure, at least in the United States. The legal issues surrounding model releases are complex and vary by jurisdiction. Although the risk to photographers is virtually nil (so long as proper disclosures of the existence of a release, and its content is made to whoever licenses the photo for publication), the business need for having releases rises substantially if the main source of income from the photographer's work lies within industries that would require them (such as advertising). In short, photojournalists almost never need to obtain model releases for images they shoot for (or sell to) news or qualified editorial publications. Photographers who also publish images may need releases to protect themselves, but there is a distinction between making an image available for sale (even via a website), which is not considered publication in a form that would require a release, and the use of the same image to promote a product or service in a way that would require a release.  Types of release  * Adult release: This is the form most commonly referred to as a \\"model release\\". The language of this release is normally intended for use by models over the age of majority. * Minor release: This variant of the model release contains language referring to the model (who is a minor) in the third-person, and required signature by a parent or other legal guardian of the model. A release which is not signed by a parent or guardian may afford no legal protection to the publisher. * Group release: This is a modified version of the adult release, which includes additional signature lines to accommodate use by multiple models or subjects in a single image.

His work is much praised for simplifying the Turkish language from the Persian and Arabic words and phrases that were common at the time. Biography √ñmer Seyfettin was born in G√∂nen, a town in Balƒ±kesir Province, in 1884. Son of a military official, he spent his early life travelling around the coast of Marmara Sea. He also began a military career and graduated from the Military Academy (Harp Okulu) in 1903. Following he was assigned as a Lieutenant and posted to Western Border units of the Ottoman Empire Army. It was in ƒ∞zmir where he became familiar with writing. In 1909, he served as an officer of the Hareket Ordusu (Action Army) which suppressed the Istanbul Irtica uprising, the religious groups opposing the newly formed constitutional monarchy in Istanbul. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk was an officer of the Hareket Ordusu. Promoted to First Lieutenant, Seyfettin was posted as an instructor in a military school in ƒ∞zmir. This position was an opportunity for Seyfettin to improve his French, and interact with like-minded writers. In 1910, Omer Seyfettin began publishing Genc Kalemler (Young Pens) with Ziya Gokalp and Ali Canip in Salonica. Seyfettin began the early efforts in using Turkish in his literary output as opposed to Ottoman Turkish, as he outlined to Ali Canip in a letter.K√∂roƒülu Erol (July 21, 2007), p.41 He was recalled to the army under mobilization orders at the beginning of the Balkan War and after his units were defeated in Yanina in January 1913, he spent approximately 12 months in Greece as a prisoner of war.K√∂roƒülu, Erol (July 21, 2007), p.154 After his release from captivity at the end of 1913, he returned to Constantinople, and was nominated the executive editor of the T√ºrk S√∂z√º, a publication which was related to the Committee for Union and Progress (CHP). In 1914, after leaving the army for the second time, Omer Seyfettin became a literature teacher in an Istanbul High school. He became, also in 1914, the chief-author (Bashyazar) of the magazine T√ºrk Yurdu. Between the years 1914 and 1917 he mainly wrote turanist poems, which were published in the outlets such as Tanin, T√ºrk Yurdu or Halka Doƒüru. In 1917 he was to publish most of his literary work, which included a wide array of short stories.K√∂roƒülu, Erol (July 21, 2007), p.159 He died of diabetes in 1920, at the age of 36.

Born in North Carolina, Forsyth joined the United States Army in 1800 as an officer and was a captain of the Regiment of Riflemen at the outbreak of war in 1812. He led raids into Upper Canada along the Saint Lawrence River in 1812‚Äì13 before transferring south and taking part in the battles of York and Fort George. Promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel, he held a command along Lake Champlain. Forsyth was killed in June 1814 at Odelltown, Lower Canada.  Early life  Forsyth was born circa 1760 in either Stokes County, North CarolinaTucker (2012), p. 247 or in Virginia. His parents were James Forsyth and Elizabeth Forsyth. Area records show he purchased land in Stokes County in 1794. In 1797 he married Bethemia Ladd. Forsyth was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the 6th Infantry Regiment on April 24, 1800 and was discharged on June 15, 1800. He was commissioned as a captain in the Regiment of Riflemen on 1 July 1808.Heitman p. 430  War of 1812  Based at Ogdensburg, New York during the autumn and winter of 1812, he led the successful Raid on Gananoque and other attacks across the Saint Lawrence River, which threatened the British supply lines to their forces in Upper Canada. In February 1813, the British used a temporary superiority in strength to drive Forsyth from his positions at the Battle of Ogdensburg. On October 24, 1812, Forsyth wrote to President James Madison that he had served as a captain for four years without promotion and requested a brevet promotion in recognition of his service.Stagg p. 441 Forsyth was promoted (not brevetted) to major on January 20, 1813 and brevetted to lieutenant colonel on February 6, 1813. The Raid on Elizabethtown occurred on February 7, 1813, when Benjamin Forsyth and 200 men crossed the frozen St. Lawrence River to occupy Elizabethtown and seize military and public stores, free American prisoners, then capture British military prisoners.Mahon, J. (1972). The War of 1812 {Pg. 140}. Da Capo Press. Forsyth's company was ordered to join the main American force at Sackett's Harbor rather than reoccupy Ogdensburg. They led the American assault at the Battle of York, and played a major part at the Battle of Fort George. Later in the year, Forsyth (now a major) and his men took part in the campaign aimed at capturing Montreal, but were not present at the Battle of Crysler's Farm. Forsyth was promoted to brevet Lieutenant Colonel the following winter. He was active in skirmishing and patrolling north of Lake Champlain in the late spring and summer and was killed in June 1814 in a clash at Odelltown, Lower Canada. Legacy Following his death, the people of North Carolina named Forsyth County after him. In addition, the state General Assembly paid for his son's education through special legislation and gave him a jewelled sword. Forsyth Street on Manhattan's Lower East Side is also named for him.

Piocha was a talented guitarist with some exposure to the Salvadoran rock scene who often experiment musically with Ernesto Asecas (\\"Neto\\") and Enrique Salopino (\\"Pino\\") who both lacked musical background and had only recently been exposed to hip-hop music. With time the experiment took a more defined shape and added new recruits, including drummer Carlos Alfredo (alias \\"Kalimba\\"), Rafa, and chorus girl and dancing king Jose Manuel (\\"Lady\\"). The sessions culminated in an ill-fated performance during a school event in the Salvadoran British School (ABC), where the band performed their original track \\"Armando Pleito.\\" Audience members were reported to have been \\"thoroughly disgusted\\" by the lack of skill, talent, and \\"any sort of entertainment value whatsoever\\"; backstage the band was escorted by the event organizer and invited to retire from the music scene indefinitely. But their ingenuity kept them going, and with the aid of Fruity Loops software, Neto, Lady, and Kique began to prepare some home-brewed tracks. Only after several attempts did the band manage to get some of their tracks on the air.

It used an electronic paper display developed by E Ink Corporation, was viewable in direct sunlight, required no power to maintain a static image, and was usable in portrait or landscape orientation. Sony sold e-books for the Reader from the Sony eBook Library in the US, UK, Japan, Germany, Austria, Canada and was reported to be coming to France, Italy and Spain starting in early 2012. The Reader also could display Adobe PDFs, ePub format, RSS newsfeeds, JPEGs, and Sony's proprietary BBeB (\\"BroadBand eBook\\") format. Some Readers could play MP3 and unencrypted AAC audio files. Compatibility with Adobe digital rights management (DRM) protected PDF and ePub files allowed Sony Reader owners to borrow ebooks from lending libraries in many countries.. The DRM rules of the Reader allowed any purchased e-book to be read on up to six devices, at least one of which must be a personal computer running Windows or Mac OS X. Although the owner could not share purchased eBooks on others' devices and accounts, the ability to register five Readers to a single account and share books accordingly was a possible workaround.

It became available in the U.S. in November 2008 at a MSRP of $399; in April 2009 it was selling for $349.99. Unlike Sony's LIBRI√©, a close cousin of the Sony Reader, the PRS-500 and PRS-505 offered no way for the user to annotate a digital book since those lack a keyboard. This was addressed by the release of the PRS-700. Improvements of PRS-700 vs. the PRS-505 include the following: * The 6-inch E Ink display (same resolution as before) is now a touch screen, removing the need for the 10 side buttons. * Note taking and virtual keyboard, made possible by the touch screen. * Page turning buttons remain but can also be accomplished by touch screen gestures. * LED lighting for use in poor lighting conditions. * Internal storage is doubled to 512 MB.

The 505 keeps the 6\\" E Ink display of the original Reader, but uses an improved version of E Ink Vizplex imaging film with faster refresh time, brighter white state, and 8-level grayscale. The PRS-505 is thinner than its predecessor (8 mm vs. 13 mm) and comes with more internal memory (256 MiB vs. 64 MiB). Other new product features included auto-synchronization to a folder on a host PC, support for the USB Mass Storage Device profile, and full USB charging capability (the PRS-500 could only be recharged via USB if the battery was not fully drained, and if the Sony Connect Reader software was installed on the host PC). Also, adding books to \\"Collections\\" (a feature to organize and group book titles) is now possible on the storage card, unlike the PRS-500 model. Version 1.1 firmware, available as a free download since July 24, 2008 adds support for the EPUB format, Adobe Digital Editions 1.5 and Adobe DRM protected PDF files, automatic reflow of PDF files formatted for larger pages enlarges the text to improve readability, and support for high capacity SDHC memory cards.

Sony Customer Support have confirmed that units sold in the US only work with Latin characters (as of 2007-03-02). On August 13, 2009, Sony announced that by the end of 2009, it would only sell EPUB books from the Sony Reader Store, and would have dropped its proprietary DRM entirely in favor of Adobe's CS4 server side copy protection. Official software =MS Windows= Sony Reader came bundled with Sony's proprietary software called Sony Reader Library (or formerly eBook Library and Sony Connect). It requires MS Windows XP or higher (MS Windows Vista or 7), an 800 MHz processor, 128 MB of RAM, and 20 MB of hard disk space. This software does not work on the 64-bit versions of MS Windows XP. 64-bit MS Windows Vista and 7 is supported since Sony eBook Library version 2.5 for all but the 500 models. In February 2014 Sony Reader announced that they were transferring content to the Kobo Store. In March 2014 the Sony Reader store was closed and account holders received an email with a link that enabled them to transfer their library to Kobo. Most titles transferred; however, some were not able to be transferred even though the titles were sold on Kobo; the transfer period ended in May.Readers Report that eBooks, Credits Aren‚Äôt Transferring From Sony to Kobo =Apple Mac OS X= Sony released an official Apple Mac OS X client for the Reader with the release of the PRS-300 and PRS-600. It is reported to work with the PRS-505, PRS-700, Reader Pocket Edition and Reader Touch Edition. The software now works under 10.7 Lion.. = Linux and other OS = Sony eBook Library was not officially supported on Linux-based systems or other operating systems, although when the device is connected it grants access to its internal flash memory and any memory card slots as though they were USB Mass Storage devices (on all models except PRS-500s that have not received the free EPUB upgrade from Sony), allowing the user to transfer files directly. See the Third party tools section below for a third-party software utility that provides comprehensive support for MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X, and Linux. Note if the device is locked, using the optional 4 digit pin it will not mount via USB, the lock option needs to be disabled in order to mount the device. Third party tools Several third-party tools exist for the Sony Reader. For example, the PRS Browser for Apple Mac OS X from Docudesk allows Apple Macintosh users to manage content on the Sony Reader. Users can also use the free software library and utility called Calibre to communicate with the Reader and manage their digital library. Calibre can convert many ebook formats as well as collate multiple HTML pages into a single ebook file with an automatically generated table of contents. Calibre can also manage RSS subscriptions, including scheduled pushes of newsfeeds to the reader. It has both a command line and graphical interface, and is available for MS Windows, Apple Mac OS X and Linux. Calibre notably does not offer MS Windows 64-bit support for the PRS-500 model either. Specialized on notes, annotations, bookmarks and other input by the user, noteworks allows for listing, exporting and other handling of this data, extracted from the device. In addition, Adobe Digital Editions can deliver DRM-locked PDF and ePub documents to the PRS-350, PRS-505 and PRS-700. The software is officially available for Windows and Mac OS. It can be run on Linux using Wine. After activating the reader on an officially supported platform, DRM-locked media can be downloaded and transferred to the reader on Linux as well.

It was published in the same year in Madras based English periodical The Indian Ladies Magazine. Plot It depicts a feminist utopia (called Ladyland) in which women run everything and men are secluded, in a mirror-image of the traditional practice of purdah. The women are aided by science fiction-esque \\"electrical\\" technology which enables laborless farming and flying cars; the women scientists have discovered how to trap solar power and control the weather. This results in \\"a sort of gender-based Planet of the Apes where the roles are reversed and the men are locked away in a technologically advanced future.\\" There, traditional stereotypes such as ‚ÄúMen have bigger brains‚Äù and women are \\"naturally weak\\" are countered with logic such as \\"an elephant also has a bigger and heavier brain\\" and ‚Äúa lion is stronger than a man‚Äù and yet neither of them dominates men. In Ladyland crime is eliminated, since men were considered responsible for all of it. The workday is only two hours long, since men used to waste six hours of each day in smoking. The religion is one of love and truth. Purity is held above all, such that the list of \\"sacred relations\\" (mahram) is widely extended.  Origin of the story  According to Hossain, she wrote Sultana's Dream as a way to pass the time while her husband, Khan Bahadur Syed Sakhawat Hossain, a deputy magistrate, was away on a tour. Her husband was an appreciative audience and encouraged Hossain to read and write in English. Thus, writing Sultana's Dream in English was a way of demonstrating her proficiency in the language to her husband. Sakhawat was very impressed by the story and encouraged Hossain to submit the piece to The Indian Ladies Magazine, which published the story for the first time in 1905. The story was later published in book form in 1908.

Ellis was Chairman of the Midland Railway from 1849 to 1858 and a Member of Parliament for Leicester between 1848 and 1852. Birth John Ellis was born near Leicester in 1789 to Joseph and Rebekah Ellis who were both members of the Society of Friends. Life As a Quaker he was involved with the 1840 World's Anti-Slavery Convention in London and was included in the painting of it that is now in the National Portrait Gallery in London. He was instrumental in establishment of the Leicester and Swannington Railway and in 1842 served as a director of the Midland Counties Railway and was the major instigator in its amalgamation into the Midland Railway in 1844, being deputy-chairman from its establishment and becoming its chairman from 1849 to 1858 after the fall of George Hudson. He was also a director of the London & Birmingham, Birmingham & Gloucester and Dunstable Railways; and later of the Manchester & Buxton and London and North Western Railways. Ellis ran his family's 400 acre farm and orchard until 1846, owned a coal and lime merchandising company, and started a worsted spinning company, Whitmore & Ellis. He was also a partner and agent in two collieries. In 1858 he served as director of Pare's Leicester Banking Company as well a chairman of the Leicester Savings Bank. In public service, Ellis served as a Leicester town councilor in 1837 and a Leicester Alderman in 1838 prior to becoming an MP. In 1845, John Ellis encountered Edward Sturge and Joseph Gibbons while they were travelling to a meeting regarding the sale of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway to the Great Western Railway. Ellis saw an opportunity and offered that his company would purchase the Gloucester companies with 6% on their capital of ¬£1.8 million if discussions with the GWR were inconclusive. The GWR declined to increase their offer, and the Gloucester companies turned back to Ellis. Death and legacy John Ellis died in 1862 at Belgrave Hall and was survived by a son, Edward Shipley Ellis, from his first marriage to Martha Shipley (d:1817); his second wife Priscilla Evans, and their three sons and six daughters.Christy, Miller, rev.

Physiology  = Hormonal pathways and neuroendocrine control = Breastfeeding delays the resumption of normal ovarian cycles by disrupting the pattern of pulsatile release of GnRH from the hypothalamus and hence LH from the pituitary. The plasma concentrations of FSH during lactation are sufficient to induce follicle growth, but the inadequate pulsatile LH signal results in a reduced estradiol production by these follicles. When follicle growth and estradiol secretion does increase to normal, lactation prevents the generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge and follicles either fail to rupture, or become atretic or cystic. Only when lactation declines sufficiently to allow generation of a normal preovulatory LH surge to occur will ovulation take place with the formation of a corpus luteum of variable normality. Thus lactation delays the resumption of normal ovarian cyclicity by disrupting but not totally inhibiting, the normal pattern of release of GnRH by the hypothalamus. The mechanism of disruption of GnRH release remains unknown. In women, hyperprolactinemia is often associated with amenorrhea, a condition that resembles the physiological situation during lactation (lactational amenorrhea). Mechanical detection of suckling increases prolactin levels in the body to increase milk synthesis. Excess prolactin may inhibit the menstrual cycle directly, by a suppressive effect on the ovary, or indirectly, by decreasing the release of GnRH. = The suckling stimulus = Suckling intensity directly correlates with the duration of the amenorrheal period following birth. Suckling intensity has several dynamic components: frequency of suckling, duration of the suckling bout, and duration of suckling in a 24 hour period. It is not clear which of these plays the most critical role in maintaining amenorrhea. Suckling intensity is highly variable across populations. Studies of U.S. and Scottish women show that at least six bouts per day and 60 minutes of suckling in a 24 hour period will typically sustain amenorrhea. Concurrent studies of !Kung women in Botswana and Gainj women in Papua New Guinea have shown that very frequent, very short suckling bouts of about 3 minutes, 40 to 50 times per day correlate with typical amenorrhea of up to two years postpartum. When an infant suckles, sensory receptors in the nipple send a signal to the anterior pituitary gland in the brain, which secretes prolactin and oxytocin. Prolactin and oxytocin trigger the release (letdown) of milk and its ejection from the nipple in a positive feedback loop. It was previously thought that prolactin hormone, which is released by the anterior pituitary in response to the direct nerve stimulation of suckling, was responsible for creating the hormonal pathways necessary to sustain amenorrhea. Now, however, it seems that this relationship is one of correlation not causation as prolactin levels in the blood plasma are simply an indicator of suckling frequency. Suckling, and the subsequent release of prolactin, is not directly responsible for postpartum infecundity. Rather it is one mechanism that increases milk production, thereby increasing the metabolic cost of breastfeeding to mothers, which contributes to sustained infecundity. Suckling as proxy indicator of infecundity rather than a direct, hormonal causal factor is supported in studies contrasting the nursing intensity hypothesis, which says that more intense (prolonged, frequent) breastfeeding will result in a longer period of lactational amenorrhea, and the metabolic load model, which posits that maternal energy availability will be the main factor determining postpartum amenorrhea and the timing of the return of ovarian function. = Lactation and energy availability = Postpartum ovarian function and the return of fecundity depend heavily on maternal energy availability. This is due to the relatively consistent metabolic costs of milk production across populations, which fluctuate slightly but represent a significant cost to the mother. The metabolic load hypothesis states that women with more available energy or caloric/metabolic resources will likely resume ovarian function sooner, because breastfeeding represents a proportionally lower burden on their overall metabolic function. Women with less available energy experience a proportionally higher burden due to breastfeeding and therefore have less surplus metabolic energy to invest in continued reproduction. The metabolic load model is therefore consistent with the nursing intensity hypothesis, in that more intense nursing increases the relative metabolic burden of breastfeeding on the mother. It also takes into account the overall energy supply of the mother in determining whether she has enough caloric/metabolic resources available to her to make reproduction possible. If net energy supply is high enough, a woman will resume ovarian cycling sooner despite still breastfeeding the current infant. = Infecundity = Amenorrhea itself is not necessarily an indicator of infecundity, as the return of ovarian cycling is a gradual process and full fecundity may occur before or after first postpartum menses. Additionally, spotting or the appearance of first postpartum menses can be a result of either lochia or estrogen withdrawal and not actual ovulation. Lactational amenorrhea has evolved as a mechanisms for preserving the health of the mother. This period of infecundity allows the mother to focus her energy on breastfeeding as well as allow time for her body to heal between births. The frequency and durations of the feedings determine how long the mother will continue to be infecund during breastfeeding. However there is variation across different cultures. The Turkana, Gainj, and Quechua societies all breastfeed on demand until their child is around 2 years old. The timing of returned ovulation for these women is however varied. Because of this, interbirth intervals vary across these three societies.  Return of fertility  Return of menstruation following childbirth varies widely among individuals. This return does not necessarily mean a woman has begun to ovulate again. The first postpartum ovulatory cycle might occur before the first menses following childbirth or during subsequent cycles. A strong relationship has been observed between the amount of suckling and the contraceptive effect, such that the combination of feeding on demand rather than on a schedule and feeding only breast milk rather than supplementing the diet with other foods will greatly extend the period of effective contraception. In fact, it was found that among the Hutterites, more frequent bouts of nursing, in addition to maintenance of feeding in the night hours, led to longer lactational amenorrhea. An additional study that references this phenomenon cross-culturally was completed in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and has similar findings. Mothers who breastfed exclusively longer showed a longer span of lactational amenorrhea, ranging from an average of 5.3 months in mothers who breastfed exclusively for only two months to an average of 9.6 months in mothers who did so for six months. Another factor shown to affect the length of amenorrhea was the mother's age. The older a woman was, the longer period of lactational amenorrhea she demonstrated. The same increase in length was found in multiparous women as opposed to primiparous. With regard to the use of breastfeeding as a form of contraception, most women who do not breastfeed will resume regular menstrual cycling within 1.5 to 2 months following parturition. Furthermore, the closer a woman's behavior is to the Seven Standards of ecological breastfeeding, the later (on average) her cycles will return. Overall, there are many factors including frequency of nursing, mother's age, parity, and introduction of supplemental foods into the infant's diet among others which can influence return of fecundity following pregnancy and childbirth and thus the contraceptive benefits of lactational amenorrhea are not always reliable but are evident and variable among women. Couples who desire spacing of 18 to 30 months between children can often achieve this through breastfeeding alone, though this is not a foolproof method as return of menses is unpredictable and conception can occur in the weeks preceding the first menses. Although the first post-partum cycle is sometimes anovulatory (reducing the likelihood of becoming pregnant again before having a post-partum period), subsequent cycles are almost always ovulatory and therefore must be considered fertile. For women exclusively breastfeeding ovulation tends to return after their first menses after the 56 days postpartum time period. Supplementing nutritional intake can lead to an earlier return of menses and ovulation than exclusive breastfeeding. Nursing more frequently for a shorter amount of time was shown to be more successful in prolonging amenorrhea than nursing longer but less frequently. The continuing of breastfeeding, while introducing solids after 6 months, to 12 months were shown to have an efficiency rate of 92.6 ‚Äì 96.3 percent in pregnancy prevention. Because of this some women find that breastfeeding interferes with fertility even after ovulation has resumed. The Seven Standards: Phase 1 of Ecological Breastfeeding # Breastfeed exclusively for the first six months of life; don‚Äôt use other liquids and solids, not even water. # Pacify or comfort your baby at your breasts. # Don‚Äôt use bottles and don‚Äôt use pacifiers. # Sleep with your baby for night feedings. # Sleep with your baby for a daily-nap feeding. # Nurse frequently day and night, and avoid schedules. # Avoid any practice that restricts nursing or separates you from your baby. Phase 1 is the time of exclusive breastfeeding and thus usually lasts six to eight months. Use as birth control For women who follow the suggestions and meet the criteria (listed below), LAM is >98% effective during the first six months postpartum. * Breastfeeding must be the infant's only (or almost only) source of nutrition. Feeding formula, pumping instead of nursing,ReproLine The Reading Room. Lactational Amenorrhea Method, which cites: and feeding solids all reduce the effectiveness of LAM. * The infant must breastfeed at least every four hours during the day and at least every six hours at night. * The infant must be less than six months old. * The mother must not have had a period after 56 days post-partum (when determining fertility, bleeding prior to 56 days post-partum can be ignored). * And to take full advantage of LAM, it is best that the baby's face not be covered when feeding. Routinely covering the baby reduces the baby's access to oxygen and visual contact with the mother, which trains the baby to speed up the suckling process and thus reduces the time period, rendering LAM less effective. If not combined with barrier contraceptives, spermicides, hormonal contraceptives, or intrauterine devices, lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) may be considered natural family planning by the Roman Catholic Church.  Cross cultural use of lactational amenorrhea  The use of lactational amenorrhea method (LAM) can be seen across the world. It is used in many different societies to varying extents. LAM can be used by itself or in combination with other methods. There are multiple examples of LAM use covered in studies conducted about postpartum birth control methods in various countries and areas of the world. Additionally, the connection between LAM use and infant nutrition and health has been examined in different contexts. Beyond the physiological factors that influence lactational amenorrhea, cross cultural differences can help account for many of the variations in lactational amenorrhea. In Turkey, exploration of LAM has exposed a distinct lack of knowledge surrounding the connection between lactational amenorrhea and birth control. However, these findings are contrasted with the fact that mothers demonstrated a desire to learn about LAM as a method of contraception. This lack of knowledge is not necessarily evident in other parts of the globe as exemplified in South-Eastern Hungary with the use of post-partum contraceptives. There is an imbalance of birth control method usage postpartum. LAM makes up nearly double the usage of other contraceptive usages. One of the primary factors influencing choice of contraceptive in this area is level of education. A higher level of education correlates to a bigger chance of utilizing effective contraception methods rather than LAM. Nutrition and health of both the mother and infant are connected to the use of LAM in the international community. By promoting LAM, exclusive breastfeeding for the infant becomes more prominent in order to make LAM as effective as possible. In Egypt, this has been shown to combat poor nutritional practices of mothers. To make sure infants are getting fully enriching breast milk, mothers must take their own nutritional practices seriously, leading to an overall improvement of nutrition. An area in Kenya further provides evidence that there is a substantial link between proper nutrition and LAM, specifically with infants. This exclusive use of breastfeeding has a positive impact on preventing pregnancy as well as reducing child mortality. The promotion of LAM has shown an increase in breast feeding overall, resulting in better prospects of survival for infants.

His 1949 book Introgressive Hybridization was an original and important contribution to botanical genetics. Career Anderson was born in Forestville, New York. When he was three, his family moved to East Lansing, Michigan where his father had accepted a position to teach dairy husbandry. In 1914 Anderson entered Michigan State College to study botany and horticulture. After completing his degree he joined the Naval Reserve and in 1919 he accepted a graduate position at the Bussey Institution of Harvard University. His studies were supervised by geneticist Edward Murray East and Anderson worked on the genetics of self-incompatibility in Nicotiana. He was awarded a master's degree in 1920 and a DSc in agricultural genetics in 1922. Iris versicolor He accepted a position as a geneticist at the Missouri Botanical Garden and was appointed assistant professor of botany at Washington University in St. Louis. His research was focused on developing techniques to quantify geographic variation in Iris versicolor. In 1929 he received a fellowship to undertake studies at the John Innes Horticultural Institute in Britain, where he worked with cytogeneticist C. D. Darlington, statistician R. A. Fisher, and geneticist J. B. S. Haldane. Anderson's data set on three related species of irises was used by Fisher as an example with which to demonstrate statistical methods of classification and has subsequently become very well known in the machine learning community, though often described as Fisher's iris data. Scatterplot of the Iris flower data set Anderson returned to the United States in 1931 and took a position at the Arnold Arboretum at Harvard where he worked with geneticist Karl Sax. In 1935 he returned to Missouri and in 1937 received the Engelmann Professorship in botany at Washington University. In 1941 he was invited to present the Jesup Lectures at Columbia University with Ernst Mayr, discussing the role of genetics on plant systematics, however unlike the other presenters of the Jesup Lectures who later wrote regarded as the foundation of the modern evolutionary synthesis, he never completed his accompanying manuscript. He published Introgressive Hybridization in 1949 which described the role of introgression in speciation. He also wrote the popular science book Plants, Man, and Life which was published in 1952. He was briefly director of the Missouri Gardens in 1954, but returned to teaching in 1957. He retired officially in 1967. Anderson was a close colleague and friend of Esther Lederberg . They frequented the Cold Spring Harbor Symposia and had many other colleagues in common, such as J. B. S. Haldane. Anderson was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1934. In 1954, he was an elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences. He was also president of the Botanical Society of America, and was a charter member of the Society for the Study of Evolution and the Herb Society. He received the Darwin-Wallace Medal of the Linnean Society. References Further reading *Kleinman, Kim. (1999). His Own Synthesis: Corn, Edgar Anderson, and Evolutionary Theory in the 1940s.

Background and introduction The Gibson Thunderbird was introduced in 1963.\\"Gibson Thunder Bird IV\\", Gibson.com At the time, Fender had been the leader in the electric bass market since their introduction of the Precision Bass twelve years earlier. The Thunderbird was designed by U.S. auto designer Raymond H. Dietrich (Chrysler, Lincoln, Checker) along with the Firebird guitar, which it resembles in design, construction, and name. Design and construction Josh Reedy of DecembeRadio playing a custom Gibson Thunderbird onstage. The Thunderbird bass, like the Rickenbacker 4000 series and the Firebird guitar designed concurrently, had neck-through construction: the neck wood runs the entire length of the body, with the rest of the body glued into place, although some cheaper Epiphone models feature a more conventional bolt- on neck construction. While previous Gibson bass guitars had a short scale of 30¬Ω\\", the Thunderbird had a 34\\" scale equal to that of the 34\\" scale of Fender's bass guitars. There were originally two Thunderbird models, the Thunderbird II (one pickup) and Thunderbird IV (two pickups) The Thunderbird generally features bass humbuckers, colloquially referred to as \\"soapbars\\" due to their oblong shape. =Non-reverse Thunderbirds= In 1966, Gibson changed the Thunderbird's design and construction. The original Thunderbirds (and Firebirds) had a \\"reverse\\" body, with the treble horn extended and the bass horn recessed. Due to a lawsuit brought by Fender because of the resemblance to the Fender Jazzmaster, the body styles were modified, with the result being called the \\"non-reverse\\" body. Also, the expensive neck-through construction was replaced by traditional Gibson set-neck construction. The non-reverse Thunderbird was continued until 1969, when the Thunderbird was discontinued. Though fewer non-reverse Thunderbirds were shipped, the original reverse-body instruments retain a higher collector's value. Gibson started producing the non-reverse Thunderbirds again for the public in late 2012. 1976-79 reissue The Thunderbird IV was reissued in 1976 as a bicentennial edition. This reissue featured the original body shape and neck-through construction but unlike the previous issues, the bicentennial edition included the new \\"3-point\\" bridge and a red, white, and blue thunderbird logo. The bass was offered in tobacco burst, ebony, white, or natural finish. After the bicentennial, the Thunderbird was continued as a regular production model until 1979, when it was discontinued once again.

After the war, he continued in leadership roles throughout the American Indian community, creating the Indian Service League of Chicago, which functioned as a social club. Greenwood represented Illinois Indians at the National Convention of American Indians in 1953 and helped influence national policies about American Indians as the Chairman of Ways and Means at the American Indian Chicago Conference in June, 1961.

Biography =1966‚Äì1991: Early life and education= Herman was born July 25, 1966 in Philadelphia but raised in Libertyville, Illinois, and attended Libertyville High School. She worked on the high school paper Drops of Ink with Tom Morello of Rage Against the Machine and The Nightwatchman; Adam Jones of Tool; and Jim Naureckas, editor at Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR). Herman was introduced to punk, new wave, and alternative culture at an early age through schoolmate and high school friend Stephanie Brown, whose brother was an album cover artist for clients like Warner Bros., Beserkley Records, The Tubes, and The Stranglers. Through this connection, she attended her first rock concert at age twelve, where she saw The Stranglers and met Hugh Cornwell. Shortly after, she saw and met The Tubes, and was given a rudimentary drum lesson by Prairie Prince. Midway through her senior year of high school, Herman moved to Prior Lake, Minnesota, though her high school diploma is from Libertyville High School. She attended the University of Minnesota, with a major of Film Studies and minor in Journalism, and lived in Minneapolis. In January 1985, during freshman year winter break at University of Minnesota, Herman went back to Illinois to help produce a horror spoof, The Season of the Snow Bitch, with LHS alumni, notably Morello and Jones, whose band the Electric Sheep provided the soundtrack for the video. Through Shannon Selberg, vocalist for Minneapolis noise rock band Cows, Herman met the other members of Babes in Toyland prior to their formation as a band. In 1988, after her brother injured his hand in a restaurant pasta machine accident, Herman inherited his bass guitar and started her first band, M&M; Stigmata. The band booked a show before writing any songs or having a practice. Babes in Toyland's Kat Bjelland was in attendance at the band's debut at Minneapolis' Uptown Bar, where the three-piece band's singer and guitarist showed up impaired and unable to play the guitar. Bjelland recorded the show, which was played with drums, bass, and vocals only. In 1989, Herman moved to Chicago, where she quickly became part of the burgeoning indie scene that included Steve Albini, The Jesus Lizard, Touch and Go Records, and the beginnings of the Billions Booking Agency. In 1992, while attending Columbia College Chicago and working in the English Department, Herman was invited to replace Babes in Toyland's departing bassist Michelle Leon. At the time, Herman was the bassist for Chicago band Cherry Rodriguez. =1992‚Äì1996: Babes in Toyland= Herman replaced Leon as Babes in Toyland bassist in 1992. Herman described her initiation into the band (Harmony Central, 8/23/00): :\\"An old friend phoned with news that the bassist had quit the band and asked if I'd like to join. That band, Babes in Toyland, had just signed to Reprise and was about to record their major label debut. I joined. In two weeks I was on tour, with a recording session scheduled immediately after we got off the road.\\" She played on the band's albums Fontanelle and Nemesisters and the Painkillers EP. She sang lead vocals on the Nemesisters cut \\"Killer on the Road\\". AllMusic described her bass playing as a \\"gut-pounding, throttling beat\\".\\"Babes in Toyland: Biography\\", AllMusic. Herman was again reunited with her Libertyville High School classmates Morello and Jones on 1993's Lollapalooza, when Babes in Toyland, Rage Against the Machine, and Tool were all playing the alternative rock tour that year.\\"Libertyville's Favorite Son Rages On About Rock and Racism\\", by Chris Heim, The Chicago Tribune, July 2, 1993. She recounted her state of mind when she quit the band after four years, citing health issues (South Loop Review, Vol. 1): :\\"I couldn't remember the last time I had enjoyed music either as a player or a listener. It had been far too long. Warner Bros. and the rest of their dysfunctional family had chewed up all the good parts, leaving only the greedy, ugly parts exposed.\\" After Herman left, the band played sporadically with other bassists for several years, but never released another studio album. =1997‚Äì2013: Post-Babes in Toyland= Herman went on to work as associate editor for Musician magazine and freelance journalist for Rolling Stone. In 1998, Herman started her own company, Pollyanna, which was involved in the music business in various forms, including management, booking, promotion, publicity, and music publishing. In 2000, she produced Hank Williams III's CMT-circulated video \\"You're the Reason\\", directed by P.W. Long.Bessman, Jim. CMT to Debut 'Western Beat' Series. Billboard Magazine. May 27, 2000. In late 2000, at age 34, Herman entered her first rehabilitation for alcoholism while living in New York City. The following year, Herman was in lower Manhattan during the September 11 attacks, an event which left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. She subsequently relocated to Nashville, Tennessee. During this period, she developed a crack cocaine addiction, which spanned several years. In June 2003, she suffered a gang rape which resulted in a pregnancy. She ultimately kept the child, and gave birth to a daughter, Anna, in 2004. In June 2006, Herman joined San Francisco start-up Fuzz, a music, technology, and e-commerce platform and social networking community where she began as Senior Director of Business Development. In March 2008, Herman became editor-in-chief of Fuzz editorial section The Fix. In June 2008, Herman changed to an advisory position at Fuzz and founded non-profit venture Project Noise Foundation, which she started with former Fuzz colleague Chris Skarakis. In spring of 2008, Project Noise partnered with Morello, Amnesty International, and Axis of Justice on The Nightwatchman's Justice Tour, featuring artists Perry Farrell, Ben Harper, and Wayne Kramer, among others. The tour aimed to spotlight regional social justice causes and activism combined with music in two-day events across the U.S. In September 2009, Herman moved to Los Angeles to continue as executive director of Project Noise. The Foundation produced a short video for fellow nonprofit, Jail Guitar Doors. =2014‚Äìpresent: Babes in Toyland reunion; departure= In 2014, Herman rejoined the reunited Babes in Toyland. In August 2015, Herman was fired from the band, for originally unspecified reasons. In December 2015, Herman revealed that the reason she had been asked to leave the band was due to an article she had written for the website Boing Boing on the sexual assault of Runaways bassist Jackie Fox by manager Kim Fowley in 1975 and Joan Jett's denial of having witnessed it. Herman said that because of drummer Lori Barbero's business connections with Jett, namely Barbero producing an album for a band under Jett's record label, Blackheart Records, Herman was kicked out of the band for what Barbero believed to be hurting possible future business between Barbero and Jett.

Minnesota won the Series four games to one, en route to winning the 1987 World Series four games to three over the St. Louis Cardinals. Background The Detroit Tigers finished the 1987 regular season with the best record in all of baseball, at 98‚Äì64 (.605). They won the American League East by two games in thrilling fashion over the Toronto Blue Jays, overcoming a 3¬Ω-game deficit with a week to go, and clinching the division‚Äîand their second postseason appearance in four years‚Äîon the last day of the season with a 1‚Äì0 win over Toronto at Tiger Stadium. The Twins, by contrast, finished with the worst record of any of the four teams that made the playoffs, at 85‚Äì77 (.525). Although they held off the Kansas City Royals by two games to take the American League West, they were clearly seen as the underdogs against the power of the Tigers in the 1987 ALCS. The Twins would go on to win the first of two World Championships in the next four years. As for Detroit, after their elimination in this series, the Tigers would not see the playoffs again for 19 years, when they won the American League Pennant in 2006. Summary =Minnesota Twins vs. Detroit Tigers= Game summaries =Game 1= Wednesday, October 7, 1987, at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota The 1987 AL playoffs opened at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome, with the Tigers throwing Doyle Alexander against the Twins' Frank Viola. In the bottom of the second, the Twins opened the scoring when third baseman Gary Gaetti homered off Alexander to give Minnesota a 1‚Äì0 lead. However, Detroit answered back the very next half-inning, as catcher Mike Heath homered to center field to tie the game. The game remained tied until the bottom of the fifth, when the Twins erupted for three runs. Gaetti led off the inning with his second round-tripper of the game, and Randy Bush followed by stroking a triple to right field and coming home on a double by Tom Brunansky. Steve Lombardozzi sacrificed Brunansky to third, and he scored on a subsequent base hit by Dan Gladden to make it 4‚Äì1. Beginning in the top half of the sixth, however, Detroit staged a comeback. Kirk Gibson hit a home run that inning, and then Heath ripped an RBI single in the seventh that scored Larry Herndon to cut Minnesota's lead down to one. In the top of the eighth, the Tigers took a one-run lead with a pair of sacrifice flies off Twins reliever Jeff Reardon that scored Gibson and Alan Trammell. In the bottom of the eighth, however, Minnesota took the lead for good. A double by Kirby Puckett brought Gladden home to tie the game, and Don Baylor and Brunansky drove in the go-ahead runs off Willie Hern√°ndez with a single and double, respectively. A single by Johnny Grubb and a walk to Lou Whitaker was all the Tigers could muster against Reardon in the ninth, as Gibson struck out to give the Twins an 8‚Äì5 victory and a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. This was the Twins' first postseason win since Game 6 of the 1965 World Series. =Game 2= Thursday, October 8, 1987, at Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome in Minneapolis, Minnesota For Game 2, the Twins sent Bert Blyleven to the hill against Detroit's ace, Jack Morris. In the top of the second, the Tigers opened the scoring when Chet Lemon hit a two-run home run off Blyleven. In the bottom half of the inning, however, the Twins stormed back, as Gaetti doubled to right and scored on another double by Brunansky. After a walk to Greg Gagne, catcher Tim Laudner hit the third double of the inning off Morris, scoring both Brunansky and Gagne for a 3‚Äì2 Minnesota lead. The Twins extended their lead in the fourth, as Bush singled and then stole second and third. After consecutive walks to Brunansky and Gagne, Gladden singled to left to drive in Bush and Brunansky. Kent Hrbek then added a homer in the fifth, giving Minnesota a 6‚Äì2 lead. Tigers second baseman Lou Whitaker touched Blyleven for a homer in the eighth, but the Twins hurler would allow nothing more. Former Tiger Juan Berenguer struck out the side in the ninth to hand the Twins a 6‚Äì3 victory and a 2‚Äì0 series lead. =Game 3= Saturday, October 10, 1987, at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan The Series shifted to Detroit for Game 3, with the Tigers' Walt Terrell facing the Twins' Les Straker. The two pitchers matched zeroes for the first two-and-a-half innings until the bottom of the third, when Detroit's Pat Sheridan doubled to left, moved to third on a single by Whitaker, and scored on a force out by Gibson that sent Whitaker to third. After Gibson stole second, a balk by Straker scored Whitaker, and a single by Trammell brought in Gibson. A double by Herndon then scored Trammell and Lemon to give the Tigers a 5‚Äì0 lead. In the top of the fourth, the Twins cut Detroit's lead to 5‚Äì2 with a Gagne home run and a Bush single that scored Hrbek, and in the sixth they reduced the lead down to one with a two-run homer by Brunansky. In the top of the seventh, a two-out single by Gaetti drove in Gladden and Gagne to give the Twins a 6‚Äì5 lead and put them on the cusp of taking a stranglehold on the series. Facing the prospect of blowing a 5‚Äì0 lead and falling behind three games to none, the Tigers rallied in the bottom of the eighth. Minnesota brought in Reardon to get a two-inning save. After a lead-off single by Larry Herndon. After Jack Morris pinch ran for Herndon, Reardon got Tom Brookens to pop out to Hrbek on a sacrifice bunt attempt. Pat Sheridan, 1 for 6 lifetime versus Reardon, hit the first pitch he saw into the upper deck in right field for a two-run home run that restored Detroit's lead, 7‚Äì6. In the top of the ninth, Mike Henneman retired the Twins in order to put the Tigers back in the Series, which now stood at 2‚Äì1 for Minnesota. =Game 4= Sunday, October 11, 1987, at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan The fourth game of the series matched Viola against Tiger left-hander Frank Tanana, who had thrown a 1‚Äì0 complete-game shutout over the Toronto Blue Jays on the final day of the regular season to punch Detroit's playoff ticket. In the bottom of the first, the Tigers gave Tanana a 1‚Äì0 lead when Lou Whitaker walked to lead off the inning and eventually scored on a throwing error by Twins shortstop Greg Gagne. However, in the top of the third, Kirby Puckett homered off Tanana to tie the game, then Gagne added a homer in the top of the fourth to give Minnesota a 2‚Äì1 lead. The Twins made it a 3‚Äì1 lead in the fifth when Puckett came home on a Gary Gaetti sacrifice fly, but the Tigers came to within a run in the bottom of the fifth when an infield hit by Kirk Gibson scored Whitaker. In the top of the sixth, Gagne doubled, moved to third on a wild pitch, and scored on a base hit by pinch-hitter Gene Larkin to give Minnesota a 4‚Äì2 advantage. In the bottom half of the inning, the Tigers again clawed to within a run when pinch-hitter Dave Bergman followed up singles by Chet Lemon and Darrell Evans with a single of his own, scoring Lemon and moving Evans to second. After Mike Heath sacrificed Evans to third and Bergman to second, Twins manager Tom Kelly pulled Keith Atherton in favour of Juan Berenguer. However, the Tiger rally was squelched when catcher Tim Laudner picked a stunned Evans off third and Berenguer induced a flyout from Jim Morrison to end the inning. In the eighth, the Twins restored their two-run lead when Laudner reached on an error by Evans (who was playing third base, as Bergman had stayed in the game as the first baseman) and came home to score on a single by Steve Lombardozzi. In the ninth, Reardon managed to preserve a 5‚Äì3 Twins win, putting them one victory away from the pennant. This was the first road postseason victory for the Minnesota Twins/Washington Senators since Game 1 of the 1925 World Series. =Game 5= Monday, October 12, 1987, at Tiger Stadium in Detroit, Michigan In what would turn out to be the last postseason game ever played at Tiger Stadium, the Twins would send Blyleven to the mound to face the Tigers' Doyle Alexander. In the top of the second, Minnesota drew first blood when Tom Brunansky doubled home Gary Gaetti and Randy Bush, but was thrown out trying to stretch his hit into a triple. Dan Gladden and Kirby Puckett added RBI base hits of their own to give the Twins a 4‚Äì0 lead, and Tigers manager Sparky Anderson replaced Alexander with Eric King. As they had several times during the series, Detroit cut the Twins' lead down to one run in the bottom of the fourth, when Kirk Gibson scored on an Alan Trammell single and Matt Nokes followed with a two-run homer that scored Trammell. In the top of the seventh, however, the Twins restored their two-run lead when Kent Hrbek singled, moved to second when Gaetti was hit by a pitch, took third on a wild pitch by King, and plated on a sacrifice fly by Bush. In the eighth, Tiger reliever Mike Henneman, who replaced King in the seventh, allowed a double to Gladden and a walk to Gagne. Puckett then grounded to Henneman, who attempted to initiate a double play. However, first baseman Darrell Evans misplayed the ball for his second error of the series, allowing Gladden to score and make it a 6‚Äì3 Minnesota lead. Although Chet Lemon homered for Detroit in the bottom half of the inning to make it 6‚Äì4, the Twins decisively stormed ahead in the top of the ninth. Brunansky hit his second home run of the postseason, and Gladden and Gagne followed with consecutive RBI doubles off Henneman and Jeff Robinson. The Twins sent Reardon, who entered the game in the bottom of the eighth, to the hill to close out the series in the bottom of the ninth. Although an RBI single by Gibson scored Jim Morrison, the Minnesota stopper allowed nothing more, as Matt Nokes grounded out to Reardon to end a 9‚Äì5 Twins victory and clinch the franchise's first World Series berth since .

In 1876, in a 20-foot (6.1 m) sailing dory, he made the first recorded single-handed crossing of the Atlantic Ocean, landing at Abercastle in west Wales as a celebration of the first centennial of the United States. Local author Rob Morris has also written a book about the crossing called Alfred \\"Centennial\\" Johnson. Johnson's dory, Centennial, is now in the collection of the Cape Ann Museum in Gloucester, Massachusetts. It is frequently displayed alongside Howard Blackburn's sloop Great Republic, a vessel which was also used in a single-handed trans-Atlantic crossing.  Conception  Alfred Johnson (sometimes spelled Johnsen) was born in Denmark on December 4, 1846. He had run away to sea as a teenager, and after working on sailing ships eventually ended up as a fisherman in Gloucester, Massachusetts. One day in 1874, he and some friends were playing cards and discussing the possibility of a single-handed Atlantic crossing, when Johnson declared that not only would such a crossing be possible, but that it could be carried out in an open dory ‚Äî and that he could do it. When his friends scoffed, Johnson set out to prove them wrong. the sailing dory Centennial with Johnson at helm in Gloucester harbor Johnson planned to carry out his voyage as a celebration of the first centennial of the United States; his aim was to sail to Liverpool, hoping to make the 3,000-mile journey in under 90 days. He bought a 20-foot (6.1 m) dory, named her Centennial, and prepared and provisioned her for sea. She was fitted out with a centreboard, to improve her sailing qualities, and three watertight compartments which would help her float if capsized, until she could be righted.  The voyage  Alfred Johnson plaque He sailed on the crossing on June 15, 1876. He stopped briefly in Nova Scotia to make some adjustments to his ballast, then set off into the open ocean around June 25. He was sighted by several ships along the way, most of which attempted to rescue him, only to be astonished when he refused. At one time, he received a gift of two bottles of rum from a passing ship. Johnson managed an average pace of about 70 miles (110 km) a day, quite respectable for such a small boat in the open sea, and survived a major gale which capsized the boat. Against the odds, he finally made landfall at Abercastle, a small port in Wales, on Saturday, August 12. After two days' rest, he finished his voyage by sailing into Liverpool on August 21, 1876, to an enthusiastic reception. Johnson received some attention for his feat, and his boat was exhibited in Liverpool for several months; he was thereafter known as Alfred \\"Centennial\\" Johnson. When asked late in life why he had done it, he said \\"I made that trip because I was a damned fool, just as they said I was.\\" Johnson's voyage was the first recorded single-handed crossing of the Atlantic, and perhaps the first major single-handed passage carried out in the spirit of adventure.

It is a species of Iris native to North America, in the Eastern United States and Eastern Canada. It is common in sedge meadows, marshes, and along streambanks and shores. The specific epithet versicolor means \\"variously coloured\\". It is one of the three Iris species in the Iris flower data set outlined by Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper \\"The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems\\" as an example of linear discriminant analysis. Description Iris versicolor is a flowering herbaceous perennial plant, growing high. It tends to form large clumps from thick, creeping rhizomes. The unwinged, erect stems generally have basal leaves that are more than wide. Leaves are folded on the midribs so that they form an overlapping flat fan. The well developed blue flower has 6 petals and sepals spread out nearly flat and have two forms. The longer sepals are hairless and have a greenish-yellow blotch at their base. The inferior ovary is bluntly angled. Flowers are usually light to deep blue (purple and violet are not uncommon) and bloom during May to July. Fruit is a 3-celled, bluntly angled capsule. The large seeds can be observed floating in fall. =Chemical constituents= The species has been implicated in several poisoning cases of humans and animals who consumed the rhizomes, which have been found to contain a glycoside, iridin. The sap can cause dermatitis in susceptible individuals. Uses The iris has been used as magical plant, with people carrying the root (or rhizome) to get 'financial gain', or it was placed in cash registers to increase business. Symbolism The iris is the official state flower of the U.S. state of Tennessee. This designation was made in 1933 by the state legislature. Although the law does not specifically define a type of iris, it is generally accepted that the purple iris is the state flower. The blue flag is the provincial flower of Quebec, having replaced the Madonna lily which is not native to the province.

It introduced a number of changes to the law, most notably in the restriction and reduction of existing rights, clamping down on unlicensed rave parties, and greater penalties for certain \\"anti-social\\" behaviours. The Bill was introduced by Michael Howard, Home Secretary of Prime Minister John Major's Conservative government, and attracted widespread opposition. Background A primary motivation for the act was to curb illegal raves and free parties, especially the traveller festival circuit, which was steadily growing in the early 1990s, culminating in the 1992 Castlemorton Common Festival. Following debates in the House of Commons in its aftermath, Prime Minister John Major alluded to a future clampdown with then Home Secretary Ken Clarke at that year's Conservative Party conference. At the 1993 conference, Michael Howard, who had become Home Secretary, announced details of the new Criminal Justice Bill. Despite protests and discord against the bill, the opposition Labour Party took an official line to abstain at the third reading, and the Act passed into law on 3 November 1994. Key measures Key measures of the act that received public attention included: * Part III, sections 34‚Äì39 which substantially changed the right to silence of an accused person, allowing for inferences to be drawn from their silence. * Part IV, sections 54‚Äì59 which gave the police greater rights to take and retain intimate body samples. * Part IV, section 60 which increased police powers of unsupervised stop and search. * The whole of Part V covered collective trespass and nuisance on land and included sections against raves and further sections against disruptive trespass, squatters, and unauthorised campers ‚Äì most significantly the criminalisation of previously civil offences. This affected many forms of protest including hunt sabotage and anti-road protests. Sections 63‚Äì67 in particular defined any gathering of 20 or more people where: * Part V, section 80 which repealed the duty imposed on councils by the Caravan Sites Act 1968 to provide sites for gypsy and traveller use. Grant aid for the provision of sites was also withdrawn. * Part VII, which handled \\"Obscenity and Pornography\\", banning simulated child pornography, harshening provisions dealing with the censorship and age restriction of videos (as administered by the British Board of Film Classification BBFC), and also increasing the penalty on obscene phone calls. * Part XI, which dealt with sexual offences. The definition of rape was extended to include anal rape. Section 143, though not given much consideration, legalised anal sex between heterosexual couples. The age at which homosexual acts were lawful was reduced from 21 years to 18. During the passage of the Bill, MPs considered an amendment to reduce this age to 16 (thereby equating it with the age of consent for heterosexual sex) but the motion was rejected by 27 votes. Analysis of the division list revealed that 42 Conservative MPs had supported equalisation, and the motion would have carried but for the opposing votes of 38 Labour MPs. * Part XII, which was a miscellany, and included the notice that the \\"Offence of racially inflammatory publication etc. (was henceforth) to be arrestable\\", although this was later to be modified by the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005. Part XII also criminalised the use of cells from embryos and foetuses. Opposition and protest March against the Criminal Justice Bill, London, July 1994. Whilst the legislation was still under debate, the groups Advance Party and Freedom Network coordinated a campaign of resistance. The group was composed of an alliance of sound systems and civil liberties groups.Brewster B. & Broughton F. (1999) Last Night a Dj Saved My Life: The History of the Disc Jockey, Page 373, Grove Press, A movement against the bill grew across \\"the overlapping squatting, road protest and free party scenes\\". Three demonstrations were organised in London throughout 1994. The first of these took place on 1 May (May Day), with an estimated 20,000 people taking part in a march starting at Hyde Park and finishing at Trafalgar Square. The second, on 24 July, followed the same route with numbers estimated between 20,000 and 50,000. The larger turnout was partly attributed to a mobilisation from the Socialist Workers Party and with them placards reading \\"Kill the Bill\\", but it also created a degree of \\"political tension\\" with the other founding groups. The third demonstration was called on 9 October, with police estimating 20,000 to 30,000 people attending, while organisers put the figure at over 100,000. The day ended in a riot in Hyde Park that continued into the evening. Accounts stated that, around 5pm, a confrontation occurred between protesters and police when protesters attempted to bring two sound systems into the park. With such a large number of protesters, the police were overpowered and backed off. Riot and mounted police reinforcements arrived shortly afterwards, and reportedly charged at protesters in an attempt to disperse the estimated 1,500-person crowd. The civil liberties group Liberty opposed many of the measures proposed by the act at the time, regarding them as \\"wrong in principle and likely to violate the European Convention on Human Rights\\". Criticism Jon Savage, author of books on youth culture, said of the legislation in Bill form, \\"It's about politicians making laws on the basis of judging people's lifestyles, and that's no way to make laws\\".The Faber Book of Pop (1995), ed. Hanif Koureshi and Jon Savage, p. 799 George Monbiot described it as \\"crude, ill-drafted and repressive\\".> The Act was described by Professor of Cultural Studies Jeremy Gilbert as a \\"piece of legislation which was \\"explicitly aimed at suppressing the activities of certain strands of alternative culture\\", the main targets being squatting, direct action, football fan culture, hunt sabotage and the free party.Gilbert J. Discographies: Dance Music, Culture, and the Politics of Sound, Page 150, Routledge 1999, The sections which specifically refer to parties or raves were, according to Professor of Sociology Nigel South, \\"badly defined and drafted\\" in an atmosphere of moral panic following the Castlemorton Common Festival.ed. South N. (1999) Drugs: Cultures, Controls and Everyday Life, Page 30, SAGE Publications Meaden, B. (2006) TRANCENational ALIENation Page 19, Lulu, The law's attempt to define music in terms of \\"repetitive beats\\" was described as \\"bizarre\\" by Professor of Law Robert Lee. Reflecting on the time, the journalist Ally Fogg wrote in The Guardian: = Response from musicians = The British Intelligent dance music band Autechre released the three-track Anti EP in support of the advocacy group Liberty. The EP contained \\"Flutter\\", a song composed to contravene the definition of music in the Act as \\"repetitive beats\\" by using 65 distinctive drum patterns. The EP bore a warning advising DJs to \\"have a lawyer and a musicologist present at all times to confirm the non-repetitive nature of the music in the event of police harassment\\". The fifth mix on the Internal version of Orbital's Are We Here? EP was titled \\"Criminal Justice Bill?\\". It consisted of approximately four minutes of silence. In their 1995 track Sad But New, Orbital incorporated samples from John Major's 1992 conference speech. \\"Their Law\\", a song by electronic dance acts the Prodigy and Pop Will Eat Itself, was written as a direct response to the bill. A quotation in the booklet of the Prodigy's 1994 album Music for the Jilted Generation read \\"How can the government stop young people having a good time? Fight this bollocks.\\" The album featured a drawing commissioned by the band from Les Edwards depicting a young male rebel figure protecting a rave from an impending attack of riot police. In 1993, the band Dreadzone released a single, \\"Fight the Power\\", in opposition to the proposed Criminal Justice Bill, featuring samples from Noam Chomsky discussing taking action and \\"taking control of your lives\\", advocating political resistance to the proposed bill.Rhian Jones: Clampdown: Pop-cultural Wars on Class and Gender. Zero Books 2013, The track also features on a 1994 compilation Taking Liberties, released to raise funds to fight the bill. The B-side to Zion Train's 1995 \\"Dance of Life\\" single included a track entitled \\"Resist the Criminal Justice Act\\".

Background and boundaries In 1894, under the Local Government Act 1894, Sunbury on Thames was created an urban district of the administrative county of Middlesex. It adopted planning, lighting and sanitary responsibilities. For 36 years it covered just the parish of Sunbury, which still includes the hamlets (colloquially villages) of Charlton and Upper HallifordVision of Britain.org.uk Boundary Map. Retrieved 2013-07-04 but gained the parishes of Shepperton and Littleton in 1930 on the abolition of the Staines Rural District. Middlesex 1930-1965 (rest of county as at 1931) Members and programmes By 1795 the parish had a fire engine for which a keeper and assistant keeper were appointed. Before 1859 the beadle looked after it and from that year to 1879 the overseer was responsible. A volunteer brigade was proposed in 1879, and had been formed by 1895, when it was decided to hand the engine over to the newly formed urban district council. The vestry agreed to sell the old parish cage or round house in 1859. In 1860 the old part of the Cemetery was opened by public subscription, in 1873 a public meeting was held to discuss the management of the greens, and in 1874 committees were appointed for telegraphic communications and for lighting. In or before 1879 part of the parish was made a lighting district. Serious agitation for better drainage began in 1890, and in 1892 the vestry decided to press for urban status. A parochial committee was formed in the same year using the Public Health Act 1875. At a local inquiry which was held in 1893 it was said that middle-class property in the parish was depreciating because of the Staines rural sanitary authority's apathy about drainage. The latter was not represented at the inquiry and there was no opposition to the proposed urban district, which was created in the following year. The council had 12 members until 1930, when it was increased to 17 on the addition of Shepperton and Littleton parishes. By 1957 it had been further increased to 20. In 1931 all the councillors were independents and from World War II until its demise the councillors were predominantly Conservative. During the first few years the council met twice monthly, but in the few years to 1957 it met thirteen times a year. The first meeting, in January 1895, was held at the Institute. Thereafter the council met at the Assembly Rooms in Thames Street until it acquired the lease of Church Villa later in 1895. By 1930 the building was too small and a temporary one was erected in the grounds. The house known as Benwell, which now contains the council offices, was purchased in 1932. Church Villa was bought by the council after 1929 and was used as a fire station until the early 1960s. Since World War II additional office buildings were put up in the grounds. In 1895 one person was appointed surveyor and inspector of nuisances, a collector and medical officer were appointed, and the vestry clerk was made clerk to the council. In 1957 there were five chief officers, including the joint post of public health inspector and chief housing officer, and there was an administrative staff of 48. The council's own expenditure within the district rose from ¬£7,152 in 1906-7 () to ¬£293,872 in 1956-7 (). In 1896 there were committees for finance, highways and lighting, by-laws, fire brigade, Church Green improvement, sanitary and general purposes, and drainage. The last comprised the whole council and a sewerage scheme absorbed much attention at first. The 'new cemetery' was provided in 1900. By 1957 the council had built 1,570 houses and flats, of which 996 were in the old parish rather than in Shepperton or Littleton. Coat of arms The district was granted a coat of arms in November 1948. It is described as: Per fess Or and argent on a fess Vert between in chief two shepherd's crooks in saltire and in base as many bars wavy azure a mitre between two Saxon crowns of the first. The crest is: On a wreath argent and vert in front of a sun rising Or a seax (Saxon sword) fesswise point to the dexter azure hilted gules. The motto is Latin for \\"God is my sun and shepherd\\". The shepherd's crooks stand for Shepperton, and the mitre for Sunbury-on-Thames, the two main towns in the district. The motto is a pun on the prefixes of the two towns (Sunbury and Shepperton). Successor The Royal Commission on Local Government in Greater London recommended the district for inclusion for the new administrative county of Greater London. Under the London Government Act 1963, the bulk of Middlesex contributed to Greater London from 1965, but Sunbury on Thames Urban District joined two others in a transfer to a neighbouring administrative county, in this case Surrey. In 1974, under the Local Government Act 1972, the urban district was abolished and its former area was combined with that of Staines Urban District to form the present-day borough of Spelthorne.

Public companies are called Allmennaksjeselskap (ASA) while companies without limited liability are called Ansvarlig selskap (ANS). All AS companies must have a stock capital of at least NOK 30,000. In addition, they must have a board of directors, depending on the size of turnover, balance sheet total or number of employees, an auditor. They may appoint a managing director (MD) or chief executive (CEO). If the company has assets exceeding NOK 3 million, the board must have at least three members and cannot be chaired by the MD/CEO. Practically all Norwegian companies have a fiscal year from January to December, but some foreign subsidiaries may have a different fiscal year, as is allowed, to match the parent corporation. The ASA differentiates from the Aksjeselskap in that it has rules regulating its ownership. There cannot be any rules limiting the company's ownership to certain interests, and an ASA must offer a public tender to purchase stock, either new stock or from existing owners if the company is converted from an AS. Norwegian companies, both those listed on a stock exchange and banks, must be ASAs (banks, however, are exempt from certain regulation including ownership regulation). An ASA is required to have a capital of NOK 1 million; a board with at least 40% of its members from each gender as well as an auditor.

Based in San Antonio, Texas, the public company was a leader in making unprofitable lines shed by Class I railroads into viable transportation routes. The company was sold on February 4, 2000 and merged into RailAmerica. History Railtex was founded in 1977 by Bruce Flohr as a business that leased rail cars. Flohr had invested $50,000 of his own money and had investor help for another $50,000 from investors. Flohr had started as a Southern Pacific train-crew brakeman in 1965 and rose to superintendent of Southern Pacific's San Antonio Division until he became deputy administrator of the Federal Railroad Administration in 1975. Seeking to broaden the revenue base, he purchased the San Diego and Imperial Valley Railroad. Operating the railroad the company quickly developed a formula for a series of successful takeovers, including: *Taking over only railroads where he could operate on a non-union basis - Railtex trains operated with two employees paid $10 to $15 an hour while union trains operated with three to four paid an average of $25 an hour. Railtex employees were called transportation specialists or \\"transpecs,\\" *Deploying three marketing managers rather than the usual one for the line and then marketing to businesses five to 10 miles from the track as opposed to the usual next the track customers *Purchasing older locomotives which could be acquired for a fraction of new locomotives. In 1986 it acquired its second Austin and Northwestern Railroad. In 1989 it sold its rail car business to Chrysler. The company went public in 1993 trading on NASDAQ under the sign RTEX. At the time of its acquisition by RailAmerica it had 26 railroads over approximately 4,100 route miles in the southeastern, midwestern and New England regions of the United States, as well as Eastern Canada and Mexico.

Martos was born between Chernihiv and Poltava in city of Ichnia and enrolled at the Imperial Academy of Arts between 1764 and 1773. He was then sent to further his education with Pompeo Batoni and Anton Raphael Mengs in Rome. Upon his return to Russia in 1779, Martos started to propagate the ideas of Neoclassicism. He executed a large number of marble tombs, which are often regarded as the finest in the history of Russian art. Enjoying the patronage of the Russian royalty, Martos held a professorship at the Imperial Academy of Arts since 1779 and became its dean in 1814. His main claim to fame is the Monument to Minin and Pozharsky on Red Square, conceived in 1804 but not inaugurated until 1818. Owing to the many years he spent on this one work, Martos did not produce much other sculpture in the period. He died at St Petersburg. His later outdoor sculptures - those of Duke de Richelieu above the Potemkin Stairs in Odessa, Prince Potemkin in Kherson, Alexander I in Taganrog, and Mikhail Lomonosov in Kholmogory - became the symbols of those towns, although modern art critics often compare them unfavorably with his earlier, less bombastic works. During the Soviet period Martos's memorial statues - including those of Nikita Panin and his family - were snatched from the cemeteries to be exhibited in the newly set up museums, while his colossal bronze statue of Catherine II, unveiled at the top of the Moscow Nobility Column Hall in 1812, was destroyed altogether.

Anderson was born in Milton Damerel, Devon, England and educated at Bedford School. He went to North Queensland as a mission preacher in 1882. Because of the continuing drought and rabbit plague, station owners no longer had the means of supporting the church, which meant that clergy had to work for almost nothing. Anderson's episcopate was also a time of conflict between the bishop and his clergy and the clergy and their parishioners. By the turn of the century, new towns were flourishing throughout the Riverina, as the growing wheat industry gave the district a much needed economic boost.

They are most popularly implemented in service- oriented architectures (SOA) to control XML-based web services traffic, and increasingly in cloud-oriented computing to help enterprises integrate on premises applications with off-premises cloud-hosted applications. XML appliances are also commonly referred to as SOA appliances, SOA gateways, XML gateways, and cloud brokers. Some have also been deployed for more specific applications like Message-oriented middleware. While the originators of the product category deployed exclusively as hardware, today most XML appliances are also available as software gateways and virtual appliances for environments like VMWare. History of XML appliances The first XML appliances were created by DataPower and Vordel in 1999, Sarvega in 2000, Forum Systems in 2001, Managed Methods in 2005 and Layer 7 Technologies in 2002. Early vendors like DataPower focused on the XML acceleration problem which they solved through specialized hardware. While several vendors like DataPower (purchased by IBM in 2005 ) and Layer 7 Technologies continue to offer hardware accelerated options for high performance situations, advances in computing speed has made software or vmware based \\"appliances\\" practical in many common customer situations. Early use cases for XML appliances included banking and cross-agency government information sharing. Today XML appliances are widely used across finance, telecommunications, government, energy, logistics commensurate with the growing usage of XML as a cross-division and cross-company data exchange protocol. In 2005, XML appliances (or SOA appliances, as they came to be known) became increasingly associated with service-oriented architectures and more specifically the problem of governing SOA. The governance of SOA comes down to the control of how applications delivered as \\"services\\" can be shared with or called by other applications. Appliances became a popular way of controlling or governing SOA because addressed message security, availability and translation of data so that an application can call another application irrespective of the data format and security policies. Governance of SOA became so critical that Gartner published a dedicated Integrated SOA Governance Technology Sets Magic Quadrant on the topic that covered both SOA management and SOA appliances in March 2007 and most recently in March 2009. In recent years as XML has become a common way to expose data and application functionality over the Internet. XML appliances or gateways have become commonplace in many integration scenarios. Use cases of XML appliances * High-speed transformation and processing of XML traffic * Security and governance of service-oriented architectures or SOA * Control of web application API's that are commonly today exposed as XML-based REST interfaces * Integration of enterprise applications to services hosted in the cloud Common features of XML appliances * They can parse, validate, transform and route XML messages via XPath and XSLT * They can control access to applications that expose data and functionality through XML APIs * They can control SLAs for how XML-based services get shared with other applications * They can track XML traffic and usage of specific application services exposed through XML interfaces Classification of XML appliances Although the term XML appliance is the most general term to describe these devices, most vendors use alternative terminology that describe more specific functionality of these devices. The following are alternative names used for XML appliances: * XML accelerators ‚Äî are devices that typically use custom hardware or software built on standards-based hardware to accelerate XPath processing. This hardware typically provides a performance boost between 10 and 100 times in the number of messages per second that can be processed. * Integration appliance ‚Äî (also known as application routers) are devices that are designed to make the integration of computer systems easier. * XML firewalls are classes of XML appliances focused on identity and message security. They typically implement WS-Security message standards along with standards like SAML, WS-I BSP, WS-Policy and so forth. * Message-oriented middleware appliances - are hardware devices supporting the sending and receiving of messages between distributed systems. * SOA Gateways are commonly used to govern SOA traffic. * API proxy are commonly used to manage Web API's. * Cloud brokers or gateways are commonly used to integrate enterprise applications with cloud services.

The production designer Don Homfray won a BAFTA for his work on the series.Gill Ducker Other Lives: Don Homfray, The Guardian, 23 March 2012 Production War and Peace followed the success of such literary adaptations as The Forsyte Saga (BBC2, 1967). Charlie Knode designed the costumes. The production took three years (1969‚Äì72) and involved location filming in SR Serbia and at English stately homes. Soldiers of the Yugoslav Territorial Defense appeared as extras in battle scenes.

In The New Yorker in 2016, Louis Menand wrote \\"It drags in parts today, but in 1972 no one had seen television that grand or ambitious before. The length‚Äîalmost fifteen hours‚Äîmeant the series could include scenes, like the wolf hunt, or Denisov dancing the mazurka, that are dramatically superfluous but thematically vital. The acting is inspired, in part because the casting was inspired, from Anthony Hopkins, as Pierre, to David Swift, as a pint- sized, swaggering Napoleon. Everyone looks just the way he or she‚Äôs supposed to look.\\" Clive James criticised some performances: \\"I was cruel to Morag Hood when I said that her performance made me want to throw a tarpauline over her and peg down the corners. I should have blamed the director, who had obviously told her to bounce up and down at all times in order to convey exuberance. [...] In that same production, Alan Dobie as Andrei was grim enough to send you to sleep, but Anthony Hopkins was a perfect Pierre: a real tribute to his acting, because his default mode is to be in command.\\" Paul Mavis (DVD Talk) awarded it 4 stars, saying \\"it positively luxuriates in its expansive format, giving the viewer a remarkable chance to fully experience the various nuances of character and the myriad permutations of shifting relationships (as well as Tolstoy's numerous plot coincidences) that mark this mammoth work.\\" He praised Alan Dobie as \\"uniformed in Byronic splendor [...] spot-on as the dour, heroic, closed-off Andrei Bolkonsky.\\", also praising Angela Down (Maria) and Sylvester Morand (Nikolai). However, he criticised Hood's performance, saying \\"the casting of Morag Hood (which, according to the production history included in this DVD set, was a desperate, last-minute decision) is a distressing misfire. [...] poor Hood can't begin to approach the character with even a modicum of believability. Natasha begins the story as a wild, impetuous girl of thirteen - an age and a temperament that Hood evidently felt needed to be delineated by having Natasha laugh insanely at everything while leaping about like a mad thing (Hood is also far too old to be a believable 13-year-old). As for later maturing into this bewitching, erotic little beauty whom all men adore, either an actress has that innate, inexplicable quality or they don't - you can't \\"act\\" that powerful allure onto the screen. It has to come from within, and simply put, Hood doesn't have it.\\" Andrew D. Kaufman, in his book Give War and Peace a Chance: Tolstoyan Wisdom for Troubled Times said that this version had \\"much to recommend\\", although he preferred the 1966‚Äì67 Soviet film. James Monaco called it \\"easily the best adaptation [...] in any medium\\" in How to Read a Film: The World of Movies, Media, Multimedia: Language, History, Theory (1977). DVD release The series was released in a Region 2 4-DVD boxset by DD Home Entertainment in 2005. The set is accompanied by an illustrated booklet, written by Andy Priestner, which provides a detailed account of how the series was made. In 2009 Simply Home Entertainment released a 5-disc edition with 200 production stills.

It is bounded to the north by the Bay of Biscay, to the east by the river Nal√≥n, to the south by Pravia and the west by Cudillero. The eucalyptus tree is the town tree and occupies great parts of the slopes down to the coast. There are two parishes (administrative divisions): Muros de Nal√≥n (which is divided in five villages: Ea, Pumariega, Muros, Reborio and Villar) and San Esteban de Pravia. Two important buildings in the municipality are the Palace of Valdecarzana and Vallehermoso and the Church of Santa Mar√≠a. It is possible to watch a panoramical view of the Asturian coast from the Mirador del Esp√≠ritu Santo. History Before the 19th century Muros de Nal√≥n's history were tied to the municipalities of Pravia, Cudillero and Soto del Barco. All these municipalities were integrated in one City Hall, so it is difficult to analyse Muros' individual history. On 14 April 1847, Muros de Nal√≥n was constituted as a Municipality separated of Pravia. At this time, it was known locally as 'Muros\\", \\"\\"Muros de Nal√≥n\\"\\" or \\"Muros de Pravia' however on 27 June 1916 it adopted the office name of Muros de Nal√≥n by a Royal Decree. =19th century onwards= Lighthouse of San Esteban de Pravia, Muros de Nal√≥n, Asturias The 19th century brought major changes, and in the Peninsular War, French troops under the command of Marshal Michel Ney, sacked the town. It was in the 19th century when local Muros' people began litigation against the council House of Valdecarzana, being integrated in 1827 into the ordinary jurisdiction of the council of Motherwell. Two decades later, in 1847 that Muros de Nal√≥n was constituted as an independent municipality. Around this time the road from Muros to San Esteban de Pravia is established. In 1916 the City acquired the new official name Muros de Nal√≥n. In September 1934, prior to the outbreak of Spanish civil war, the ship Vapor Turquesa landed a large cargo of weapons that were supposed to be sent to Ethiopia. These weapons remaining permanently in Asturias caused numerous problems during the Civil War. In Muros de Nal√≥n, the Civil War broke a day later than other areas of Asturias.

The military side (Linesman) was replaced by the Improved United Kingdom Air Defence Ground Environment (IUKADGE), while the civilian side (Mediator) became the modern public-private National Air Traffic Services (NATS). In the 1950s, the Royal Air Force was installing a radar network known as ROTOR using war-era radars like Chain Home. A new radar, the AMES Type 80, replaced all of the ROTOR radars and command centres with a series of nine Master Control Centres and a number of associated secondary radars. While these installations were in progress in the early 1950s, CSF introduced the carcinotron, which could output a radio signal at any desired frequency. This made it a very effective jamming system, and it appeared it could render ground-based radars like Type 80 useless. Considering several possible solutions, the RAF selected an experimental radar known as Blue Yeoman, but later known as the AMES Type 85. This radar changed its frequency with every pulse, making it impossible for carcinotron operators to know what frequency to jam. The RAF initially proposed an extensive network similar to the Type 80s, but as part of the 1957 Defence White Paper the threat was seen to be moving from bombers to missiles, and in late 1958 a much smaller system with only three main radars and a single control centre became \\"Plan Ahead\\". During this same period, civilian air traffic was increasing dramatically and led to the 1962 formation of the National Air Traffic Control Services organization to handle national-scale air traffic control (ATC). It was seen that combining data from Plan Ahead and the ATC system would have many advantages. Plan Ahead became Linesman and the ATC system Mediator. The centres would share locations in West Drayton, just north of Heathrow, Glasgow Prestwick Airport, and Mediator planned a third site in Preston, Lancashire. Ultimately all three Mediator sites were built, while only the temporary \\"L1\\" at West Drayton was ever completed as part of Linesman. Construction of Linesman was greatly delayed and it was not fully operational until March 1974. By that time the strategic threat had changed dramatically, and air strikes on the UK once again became a possibility. Linesman's single centralized L1 command centre was vulnerable, and the sea-side radars even more so. Money set aside to improve Linesman was instead directed to building its replacement, UKADGE. UKADGE was further expanded with Marconi Martello radars to become IUKADGE and the Type 85s stood down in the 1990s. History =ROTOR= As the threat of German air attack on the United Kingdom faded in 1944, the wartime network of Chain Home (CH) and AMES Type 7 sites was progressively de-manned, a process that rapidly accelerated with the end of the war in 1945. At the time, it was believed it would be at least another ten years before there would be another major war, so the Royal Air Force turned its attention to research and development of radar as they felt there was little reason to deploy any systems when better ones would be available by the time they would be needed. Various events in 1949, notably the Berlin Airlift and the testing of the first Soviet nuclear bomb, led to studies to rapidly re-implement the air defence system. Most influential was the Cherry Report, which outlined a set of equipment upgrades at existing WWII-era radar sites to improve their performance, along with an entirely new communications network to coordinate the response. Adopted as ROTOR, the new system split the UK's airspace into six \\"sectors\\" controlled from underground bunkers using thousands of miles of telex lines to pass information around. ROTOR planned for a staged deployment in several stages. The first re-used existing radars and control methods and was to be operational by 1952. The second would replace the Chain Home radars with a new Microwave Early Warning (MEW) set beginning around 1957. More stations would be added and the communications systems updated over time, with the final network being fully implemented by the late 1950s. =Master Radar Stations= The entire ROTOR plan was seriously upset by an experimental radar known as \\"Green Garlic\\" that was developed at the Telecommunications Research Establishment. This was created by combining an experimental low-noise receiver with a new high-power cavity magnetron and a lash-up antenna. The system over doubled the effective range for early warning, providing good detection of bomber-sized aircraft out to . This filled most of the requirements for MEW, but would be available years earlier. ROTOR was initially adjusted to include these radars starting in 1953, known in production form as the AMES Type 80. But even as these began to be installed, further upgrades to the design pushed the detection range out even further and greatly increased its accuracy. This allowed a single radar to both detect the enemy out to the radar horizon, as well as direct fighters to the targets and get them within range of their Airborne Interception radars. With the introduction of these Type 80 Mark III's, the ROTOR plan was obsolete. There was no longer any need to send information to a central plotting room, as the radars could do everything directly from their displays. Many of the underground bunkers, recently completed at great expense, were sold off as these Master Radar Stations came online in the late 1950s. =Carcinotron= In 1953 the French electronics firm CSF introduced a new type of microwave-generating vacuum tube, later known as the carcinotron. The carcinotron could generate about a kilowatt of output signal, compared to megawatts for the latest examples of the magnetron and newer examples of the klystron. However, it had the ability to be rapidly tuned across a wide bandwidth simply by changing a single input voltage, something the magnetron could not do and the klystron only within a limited bandwidth. Previously, jamming a radar was a time-consuming process that required an operator to listen for enemy radars on a receiver, isolate signals from potentially threatening radars, and then set up a transmitter on that frequency. This was effective against radars using magnetrons, which cannot change their operational frequency. Against other types of transmitters, the operator on the ground would notice the jamming and change their broadcasts, starting the jamming process over again. If several radars could see the aircraft, keeping the jammers properly tuned could be an impossible task. In contrast, the carcinotron could tune so rapidly that one could simply sweep its output through the bandwidth of any potential enemy broadcasts. As long as this was done quickly enough that every radar would see the jamming signal during the flight time of its pulses, on the order of a few milliseconds, then the signal from the carcinotron would mix with the radar's own and cause false signals to appear on the display. The carcinotron's signal was strong enough that it would overwhelm the radar's own signal, filling the radar display with noise and rendering the aircraft invisible. To test whether such a system would actually be effective, the RAF purchased a carcinotron from CSF and fit it to an aircraft christened \\"Catherine\\". In tests beginning in late 1954, the jammer proved to be able to render the area around the aircraft unreadable, even when the aircraft was still below the radar horizon. In one test, any aircraft to either side of the jammer was invisible, meaning a single powerful jammer could hide an entire formation of aircraft. As the jammer aircraft approached the radar station, the signal would be picked up in the radar antenna's side lobes, until the entire display was filled with noise and nothing could be tracked anywhere. It appeared that the decade-long effort to provide radar coverage for the UK was being rendered useless at a stroke. =Plan Ahead= As the nature of the threat of the carcinotron became clear, the Air Ministry began looking for potential solutions. Two concepts appeared to offer a potential solution. One was to simply overpower the carcinotron; although it could produce about a kilowatt of output in total, it would have to spread that signal across all the frequencies being used by the various radars. This meant the amount of energy in any one frequency was limited, perhaps 10 Watt per megahertz of bandwidth. If the receiver carefully filtered the return signal tightly around the broadcast frequency, it might only receive a few watts of jamming. With enough transmitted power, on the order of 10 MW, the signal reflected off a target at 200 miles would be about 11 W, thereby allowing the radar's signal to remain visible. This solution only worked if the carcinotron was forced to spread its signal over a wide bandwidth, and would not work if it could concentrate its signal into a smaller number of frequencies. To ensure this, the radar's signals had to be randomly spread across a wide bandwidth. This could not be accomplished with the magnetron, whose output frequency is a function of its physical construction, but this was possible using new high-power klystrons. This possibility was developed under the name \\"Blue Riband\\", using twelve klystrons that were randomly mixed together to produce an output signal on two widely separated frequencies. Against this new design, the carcinotron would be forced to spread its signal across the entire 500 MHz bandwidth of the set of klystrons. Even then, if its signal was sweeping too slowly it might only jam one of the two frequencies being used for that pulse, allowing the other to be received unjammed. This combination forced the carcinotron to rapidly and widely sweep its signal, allowing the Blue Riband to overpower the resulting diluted jamming signal. Another possibility was to use the carcinotron's own signal as the tracking source. If a single jammer is sending out a signal its location can be determined through simple triangulation by two stations by drawing the measured angles on a shared map. But if there is more than one jammer, each station will measure several angles and it is not easy to tell which of the measured crossing points contains the jammer aircraft. The introduction of the correlator introduced a way to eliminate this ambiguity. This concept was explored in a system known as \\"Winkle\\" that used two widely separated antennas, several correlators, and a computer to calculate the location of the jammer. It was later noted that one of the two antennas could be the Blue Riband, thereby reducing the number of new sites that had to be built. Winkle proved itself able to track the jammer even while it was below the radar horizon, allowing the aircraft to be driven off before it could approach close enough to be effective against Blue Riband. By 1957 a new network combining these systems was outlined under the name \\"Ahead\\". The system would cover the entire British Isles, like ROTOR and the Type 80s before it. Because the new systems had even longer range than Type 80, the number of stations would be smaller, with the baseline deployment having only five stations. A number of Type 80s would be retained in the new network purely for early warning, in locations were interceptions would not be taking place and the anti-jamming performance was not needed. =Changing threats= Prior to this period, the air defence mission in the UK was based on a damage- limitation model which aimed to reduce the amount of damage on the UK while inflicting losses on the enemy that would make follow-up attacks impossible. This sort of concept is best illustrated by the Battle of Britain, where the RAF was able to cause enough damage on the German bomber force that daylight raids had to be abandoned. Even in the post-war era with early nuclear bombs, this basic concept was still the prevailing strategic concept. The introduction of the hydrogen bomb rendered this concept useless. In this case, a single aircraft escaping interception could cause enormous damage. Estimating the number of bombers that would reach their targets, it appeared any such attack would result in the UK being devastated. In this environment, the only way to protect the UK from destruction was to ensure the attack never occurred, and the only way to do that was to offer a significant deterrent. By 1954 there were serious concerns being expressed about the usefulness of air defences. If the goal was to deter an attack, all that was required was enough warning to ensure the V bomber force would successfully launch. Directing fighters to their targets and shooting them down with surface to air missiles seemed like a useless gesture if an attack was underway, given that there was no situation where these weapons would seriously change the outcome of the war. By 1956, all pretext of general defence was dropped and the RAF adopted the policy that the only worthwhile mission was early warning and short-term defence of the V bomber bases while they launched, the \\"protection of the deterrent\\" mission. This led to a smaller network of only three stations covering the Midlands area, under the new name \\"Plan Ahead\\". Even this mission was ultimately eliminated with the release of the 1957 Defence White Paper. This paper explored the changes to the strategic outlook with the introduction of the ballistic missile. It noted that missiles able to reach the UK from eastern Europe were already available, and by the mid-1960s these would be armed with strategic weapons with enough accuracy to attack the bomber bases. Although a Soviet bomber attack was still possible, especially low-altitude sneak attacks, such attacks would simply portend the arrival of the missiles - there was no credible scenario where the Soviets used an all-bomber attack, if they released their strategic weapons they would use all of them. If this was the case, there was really no purpose to the air defence beyond the most minimal systems needed for identification. By 1957 even the concept of defending the V bombers was abandoned; if there was credible warning of any sort of attack the bombers had to launch immediately because in all scenarios missiles would be landing shortly. The key requirement was not air defence, but rapid warning of a missile attack. In October 1957 the UK approached the US about deploying a station of the Ballistic Missile Early Warning System (BMEWS) in the UK in a location that would cover attacks on the V bomber bases. =New mission= With the changes brought about by the White Paper, there appeared to be no need for Plan Ahead. However, air planners soon pointed out a critical problem. If the Soviets equipped an aircraft with a powerful carcinotron, they could fly it well off the shore and jam the relatively limited frequency band of the BMEWS. This would obscure a missile attack, and the V bombers would be forced to launch until the nature of the threat was determined. If the Soviets repeated this trick, the bomber force and its crews would be quickly worn out. The solution to this problem was to build a much smaller defensive network with enough performance to attack a jammer aircraft while it was still far enough away that the BMEWS would still be operational. This led to a new Ahead layout in 1958 with three stations arranged in a triangle covering the V bomber bases and extending to cover the BMEWS. Even this limited deployment was heavily criticised within the government, not the least of which by Prime Minister Harold Macmillan himself. He desired to move the UK's own force to missiles as well, at which point the network would be superfluous. Eventually, the plan was approved only if all other air defence radars were cancelled, and accordingly, work on the Blue Joker system ended in 1960. =Air traffic control= Through the 1950s, the RAF had become accustomed to treating the airspace above as their own to use as they saw fit. At that time, the RAF's fighters and bombers were jet powered and flew at altitudes and speeds that the civilian aircraft, mostly propeller- driven, could not touch. The introduction of the first jetliners, and their rapid expansion in the late 1950s, had led to a number of close calls between civilian and military traffic. This would only get worse over time. Some sort of system would be needed to cover the high-altitude traffic across the entire UK, and this led to the National Air Traffic Control Service (NATS) under Laurence Sinclair, who were planning an extensive network of their own based on the new Decca DASR-1 and Marconi S264 radars. Macmillan remained sceptical of Plan Ahead and asked the Chief Scientific Advisor to the Ministry of Aviation, Solly Zuckerman, to consider it. Zuckerman stated there was no way to significantly reduce the estimated cost of the system and still have a military use. However, he suggested one solution would be to use it as the basis for a shared military/civilian air traffic control network and thus share the costs that would otherwise require two complete networks. A series of follow-up studies by NATS all agreed with Zuckerman, pointing out that a military network would need complete information on civilian flights anyway in order to filter out contacts that were scheduled jetliner traffic. There appeared to be no reason not to merge the networks, and the result would be a network once again covering the entire UK. Only minor changes were made to the military network. One was to move the location of the inland radar to a new location further north on the eastern shoreline, which was intended to cover the BMEWS location now that it had also moved to its final position at RAF Fylingdales. This meant the original triangular layout was now an extended line, but this had little effect on the overall performance. The other change was to move the southern-sector control centre from RAF Bawburgh to be beside the new London Area Control Center in West Drayton, which would significantly reduce the cost of the telecommunications equipment. This led to a firestorm of protest within the RAF, because while it was true this would help communications with the civilian network, it made communications with the military radars more difficult, potentially able to be jammed. The argument over this issue raged, but no changes were made in the immediate term. = Linesman/Mediator= By 1961 any remaining argument was overruled, and on 21 February the Treasury released funding for the newly-christened Linesman/Mediator. Implementation Linesman, whilst part of the \\"Ahead\\" plan, evolved out of the study into combining radar information carried out in the late 1950s by the Royal Radar Establishment (RRE) at Malvern with the participation of the Automatic Telephone and Electric Company (ATE) of Liverpool. The concept was to reduce the complexity of the existing distributed ROTOR system using multiple Master Radar Stations (MRS) with a single site designated \\"L1\\" (Linesman 1). L1 would be able to direct all of the air command using a complete air picture of the UK. During the initial stages of the project RRE became the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment (RSRE) and, in 1962, AT&E; was merged with Plessey. Linesman was a comprehensive upgrade of the UK air defence system; along with work on the signalling and communications issues, upgrades to the existing radars were also planned. The existing Type 80 radars used in the MRS network were powerful but relatively easy to jam. Upgrades were aimed primarily at offering improved jamming resistance in the event of a noisy ECM environment. To augment the existing Type 80 a new Type 84 radar had already been proposed. Linesman proposed that three new radars were developed, two primary long-range search radars; Marconi's Type 84 and the AEI Type 85 \\"Blue Yeoman\\", with additional height finding capability being provided by the Decca HF 200 height-finder. To improve system resilience to jamming the two primary radars operated on different frequency bands, the Type 84 in \\"L\\" band, the Type 85 in \\"S\\" band. As the system developed more systems were added to improve the ECM capability of the system. During various reviews of Linesman and the \\"Ahead\\" plan it was decided to incorporate civilian air traffic control, the \\"Mediator\\" portion of the plan. Linesman and Mediator were now considered jointly, although this led to escalating costs and the subsequent need to scale down the original plan. Whilst the L1 was originally intended to be underground at Bawburgh, Norfolk, cost cutting between 1960 and 1962 led to a prototype of the L1 system being set up above-ground in Building 123 at West Drayton in 1963. The Mediator element set up LATCC (London Air Traffic Control Centre) in a building nearby. LATCC used the Linesman data in their Marconi Myriad computers to handle all air traffic control in the London area. Here the main manufacturers (Plessey ‚Äì data processing, and Marconi ‚Äì displays) carried out enhanced development. Each of the Linesman sites was able to operate on its own, but the network was intended to be controlled from the centralized \\"L1\\" site (now at West Drayton). Each of the field stations sent data to L1 over microwave links, eventually phone lines, where it was recombined to form a country-wide view of the airspace; a Recognized Air Picture (RAP). The original central computer system for Linesman consisted of 21 Plessey XL4 and XL6 germanium computers, integrated as the Radar Data Processing System (RDPS). These computers worked together using random highways that were a very early version of a Local Area Network. The 21 RDPS computers then worked to assemble the Recognised Air Picture (RAP) which covered an area 1024 by 1024 nautical miles over the British Isles. Three more Ferranti Argus 500 computers were added to this as the Recognised Air Picture Dissemination System (RAPIDS) which also extended the RAP to 1900 by 1900 nautical miles. Long-range early warning data was also fed through data links to and from NATO and French radar sites. Other parts of the system were never commissioned, including three more computers that would have integrated the processing of filed civilian flight plans, and data links that would have been used to integrate the Bloodhound missile's computer systems as well as a link to Fylingdales. The RDPS was working operationally until 1984 when it was scrapped. But the Ahead plan and the Linesman system were one of the earliest visions of using computers for distributive processing in both local and wide area networks. There were even early concepts of packet switching and routing of data. Sites The concept of two main data processing hubs, the L1 and L2, also divided the UK into two areas: the Northern Track Production Area (NTPA) and the Southern Track Production Area (STPA). The L1 primarily looked after the STPA with inputs from four main sites ‚Äì RAF Neatishead in Norfolk, RAF Staxton Wold in Yorkshire, RAF Boulmer in Northumberland and RAF Bishops Court in Northern Ireland. To this there were also inputs from six civilian radars at Ash, Ventnor, Clee Hill, Burington, London 1 and London 2. It was understood from the start that the L1 site, above ground and made largely of glass, was subject to air attack; as the second \\"L2\\" site originally planned to be built underground at Prestwick was never carried out, elements of the air defence system were devolved out to use the standby capabilities of the radar sites, namely the Standby Local Early Warning and Control (SLEWC) systems at RAF Neatishead and RAF Boulmer. Because the L2 was never implemented, the L1 had to extend its processing to cover the Northern Area as well but, with no computer data links, inputs for RAF Saxa Vord, RAF Benbecula and RAF Buchan had to be voice-told for manual input into the L1 system. Later the L1 also took an input from RAF Portreath in Cornwall. Data from Shackleton AEW aircraft also had to be voice-told into the L1 computer system. On the output side, the Recognised Air Picture as the General Situation Display (GSD) was fed out as the Higher Formation Display (HFD) to RAF High Wycombe, RAF Bentley Priory and HMS Warrior (Northwood). As with the ROTOR plan, buildings were given \\"R\\" designations, including underground bunkers as well as above- ground technical and operations buildings. There was a serious fire in the R3 bunker at RAF Neatishead where it had to move into temporary buildings above ground for some time. In addition, the R3 at RAF Boulmer was closed down for refurbishment in December 1982 and operations moved to the Boulmer Interim Facility (BIF). Equipment The core system principle was to take the input from all sensors and enable 'The Hub Concept' where the system resources were reorganized to provide an air data processing system. This produced an RAP, (Recognised Air Picture) whereby all aircraft and air movements could identified and tracked within the UK air space. Intercepts etc. were undertaken at other sites using the information feeds from L1. It continued in operation until the late 1970s, early 1980s. The core to the system were the Type 84 & 85 primary radars. Height finding capability was provided by the Type 85 (one of the first 3D radars) and the HF200 Height Finders. As Linesman progressed additional systems were introduced to aid ECCM capability and communications. Each primary radar had an associated secondary radar (IFF), SSR 750, with the smaller secondary radar mounted on the main primary radar aerial. =Primary radar T84= The Marconi AMES Type 84 was a primary \\"L\\" band radar. The main transmitting equipment was contained in a building over which the aerial was mounted; this building was given the type designation \\"R17\\". The transmitter was a magnetron in the single storey building, the signal passing through a rotating joint in the rotating cabin before being fed to the hornstacks on the aerial. The aerial was designed as two 60 foot by 21 foot elliptical parabolic antennas placed back-to-back, one acting as the radar, and the other as an IFF/secondary radar system. In practice the original IFF system was never installed, and instead more modern systems with much smaller antennas were installed on the \\"front\\" dish, either below the feed horn, or on top of the main antenna. The received signals from both the primary and secondary radars were processed at the main technical building for the Linesman site, the R12 building. =Primary radar T85= Type 85 The AEI (later Marconi) AMES Type 85 \\"Blue Yeoman\\" radar operated in the \\"S\\" band part of the spectrum. By comparison with the Type 84 it was massive, a MOPA system with 12 klystron transmitters and 60 receivers. The equipment was housed in the main technical block for the Radar site, the R12 building, the aerial being mounted on top of the building. The Type 85 ended up using the same design of antenna as the T84, although only \\"one side\\" of it, the aerial for the associated secondary radar being mounted underneath, rather than above. The Type 85, however, offered an extremely advanced ECCM system enabling the shifting frequencies on the fly, or as it is now known frequency agility. The radar had 12 transmitters which were grouped in four bands, A, B, D & E. Each transmitter had a peak power output of 5 MW, giving 60 MW total power output, this massive power was routed through waveguide switches that enabled the aerial to produce a standard \\"cosec squared\\" beam or, in conditions of intense ECM the power concentrated into a beam 6 degrees high aimed at the target. As well as the frequency agility and sheer power the Type 85 had multiple receivers enabling the return signals to be detected through the heaviest jamming, this included \\"dicky fix\\" receivers to combat carcinotron jamming. Post reception processing, including double integration loops enabling the comparison and discarding of spurious returns enhanced the ECCM capability still further. Whilst not having the Moving Target Indicator (MTI) facility the Type 84 had, the frequency band and processing ensured the Type 85 produced a clear picture even under the most arduous conditions. As the transmission and reception of the Type 85 was based on 12 beams it was also a 3D radar. Data from the radar was passed to the Automatic Height Finder which compared comparative strength of returns from a target between beams. Given the range and known angle it is a simple process to calculate height. However this was being done hundreds of times a second on multiple targets, in the late 1960s and early 1970s it was a considerable feat. =Secondary radar= The secondary radar used in the system was the Cossor SSR750. Each primary radar had an associated secondary radar, at RAF Staxton Wold and RAF Neatishead there was an additional \\"freestanding\\" SSR. Secondary Radar information was associated with the primary (search) radar and presented on the same display. This gave operators a range of information that far exceeded the traditional, 'range and direction\\". The secondary radar was a dual military and civil system that worked by interrogating a transponder on board the aircraft, receiving and translating a coded reply. Decoding SSR signals was carried out at L1 with the decoders supplied by Elliott Automation. =Height finding= There were three height finding facilities within the Linesman system. One was built into the Type 85 radar, the second was a stand- alone system using the HF200 radar and the third was based on the SSR interrogating the aircraft's systems. The Type 85 working with the Auto Height Computer Type 12493 enabled an operator to select a target and, by triangulation in the radar's 12 beams, obtain a height. The HF200 provided another means of finding the height of a target. This radar, rather than continuously rotating, nodded on a bearing selected by the operator. The bearing derived from the main primary radar would enable a reading of the height to be sent back to the operator. The secondary radar system SSR750 as part of the joint military civil functionality could interrogate a transponder on board as aircraft for the height. This height, automatically derived from the onboard altimeter, was in the late 1960s and early 1970s shown to the operator on a box mounted above his screen. Later, with the advent of plot extraction it could be displayed alongside the aircraft on the traditional Plan position indicator (PPI) display. =Passive detection= A third system was later added to the network, the RX12874 \\"Winkle\\" passive jamming-detection system or PD system. PD consisted of a series of high-speed rotating antennas mounted on R15 buildings separated by many miles, combined with similar signals captured from a Type 85 radar. The three Type 85 radars located at Neatishead, Staxton Wold, and Boulmer used the associated high speed PD aerials to make a PD baseline. For this the two aerials (T85 and PD) 100 miles apart had to be in sync to ensure they swept the same area of sky at the same time, sync and turning information was sent over microwave link. For example, the Type 85 at Neatishead used the signals captured from the high speed aerial at Staxton Wold to detect jamming aircraft. Each Type 85 with its associated high speed aerial was able to provide a PD baseline of several hundred miles to the north and south. There was a high speed aerial situated at Dundonald Hill in Ayrshire, Scotland which provided a baseline to the north of RAF Boulmer, but there was no similar extension to the south of RAF Neatishead. The signals were combined at one of the radar stations (at the location of the Type 85 forming one end of the baseline) in a phase correlator that produced a series of possible locations and plotted them as a series of blips on a unique \\"theta-phi\\" display. The operators manually adjusted gains in order to reduce the number of blips, and then sent that information to a remote display where it could be combined with normal data from the Type 85. The idea was to locate any specialty-equipped jammer aircraft within a larger attack, allowing them to be prioritized for attack, thereby lowering the ECM load on other radars. Operational training Such a complex system required that Operators be fully trained. To this end L1 had a large, digital radar simulator that was capable of generating all the radar inputs of the live system. It was ordered from Elliott Automation following the successful development of the world's first digital radar simulator by that company. Based on the Elliot 502 computer it could simulate 6 radar heads with jamming and noise while displaying over 200 aircraft. Operation Linesman, as originally conceived, never became operational. It went operational in the early 1970s but only in producing and disseminating the overall Recognised Air Picture, the General Situation Display and the Higher Formation display until 1984. The interception side was only ever used in the training role of the School of Fighter Control. The L1 got three more computers (Elliott Argus 500s) as the Recognised Air Picture Dissemination System (RAPiDS) and these disseminated the RAP out from the L1 in a more advanced format. Though the concepts remained valid, the technology used to route the radar signals was out-of-date long before the system was completed. Having the control of aircraft centralised in one place also put it at high risk. A change of plan moved the interception roles out to two of the main radar stations, where the RAP from the L1 was used to monitor the airspace while the Fighter Controllers then used the Standby Local Early Warning and Control Systems (SLEWC based on Elliott 920C computers) to control interceptions. In the original design, processed radar signals were returned from the radar station to L1 and LATCC via microwave links. In the 1960s and 1970s this consisted of processed, but by today's standard raw, video and turning information (i.e. the angle of azimuth of the radar aerial). Received signals from the PD equipment and aerial turning synchronisation information were transmitted over the same links. In the late 1970s, plot extraction equipment was introduced. This took the primary and associated secondary radar outputs, combined and processed them before sending them over telephone lines to the L1. The RPEARDS (Radar Plot Extraction And Remote Display Equipment) was a hard-wired computer that processed, combined and transmitted the signals. Its memory was magnetic core store that had the capacity of some 1000 words, each of over 60 bits in length, and transmission over the telephone line was at 2400 baud using GMSK.  Legacy  Linesman built on Rotor which had built on Chain Home and the lessons of the Second World War. During the dangerous and tense period that was the Cold War, where the detection and interception of Russian bombers was a weekly, if not daily, event, Linesman enabled the protection and policing of UK air space. IUKADGE and subsequent developments have all built on the legacy of these systems, systems which stem from the Dowding System. An air defence system that enables the quick and accurate deployment of assets to intercept a threat conserves resources and targets them to where they are of the most use. Conceived, proven and tested in the heat of the Battle of Britain, the system is still sound even if the technology has improved many times and the threat since 9/11 has been significantly altered. A spin-off from the Linesman/Mediator work at RSRE Malvern was the invention of the touchscreen in 1965. This was carried out by a team led by E.A Johnson, working in H Building at Malvern. Whilst much of the evidence of Linesman systems and their associated above-ground installations has gone, it is still possible to get a feeling for what operating and working at the height of the Cold War was like at the RAF Air Defence Radar Museum at RAF Neatishead.

History Alaska grew up around the eponymous Alaska Mine, where pre-colonial miners are believed to have mined about a million tonnes of ore. Messina Transvaal Development Company (MTD) started producing copper in 1959 and the Mine closed in 1977. MTD built a smelter nearby in 1966 and a Refinery in 1980. Other mines in the district also produced copper flotation concentrate which was brought to Alaska for smelting and refining. These Mines included MTD's Mhangura copper mine in Mhangura and Shackleton mine near Lions Den. The smelter and refinery closed in late 2000 by which time most of the mines feeding it had to close, devastating the local economy and plunging the town's inhabitants into poverty. Periodic reports of Chinese investment reopening the mine and smelter have not come to fruition. Population According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 3,854.

The tanker is expected to remain in service until the 2020s. Construction and acquisition Delos was built at Hyundai Mipo Dockyard in South Korea. Another five ships were built to the same design, all for civilian service. She was launched on 12 April 2004, and was purchased by the Australian Government on 3 June 2004 and handed over from Hyundai on 16 June 2004, with the intention of modifying her as a replacement for .Saunders (ed.), IHS Jane's Fighting Ships 2012‚Äì2013, p. 35 Delos was leased (bareboat charter) to Teekay Shipping for operation as an commercial oil tanker until September 2005, then was taken up by Tenix Defence (which had been awarded the A$60 million conversion contract on 15 March 2005) for conversion into a replenishment vessel, which was completed 5 weeks ahead of schedule. Sirius was commissioned into the RAN on 16 September 2006, in a ceremony that included Westralias decommissioning. While HMAS Sirius is the first ship of this name to serve as part of the RAN, she is named after , the flagship of the First Fleet of British convicts sent to Australia in 1788. Sirius has a full load displacement of 46,775 tonnes, is in length, with a beam of and a draught of .

Sirius can carry up to of fuel, including of helicopter aviation fuel, plus 240 tonnes of dry stores carried in a container deck designed for twelve intermodal containers. Modifications by Tenix included the fitting of two replenishment points (one on each side, allowing the underway replenishment of two ships simultaneously), installation of a helicopter deck aft of the superstructure, fitting of the container deck, addition of two 70-man lifeboats and two RHIBs (the latter sourced from Westralia), and modification of the internal layout and equipment to bring it to naval standards. Sirius is armed with five 12.7 mm machine guns for self- defence. The ship's company includes 8 officers and 46 sailors. Originally, the RAN planned to have a ship specially constructed for the role. The decision to instead purchase an under-construction civilian tanker and modify her for military service allowed Sirius to enter service three years before originally planned, at half the acquisition project's planned cost. Operational history HMAS Sirius (right) refuelling in 2007 On the morning of 13 March 2009, Sirius was one of seventeen warships involved in a ceremonial fleet entry and fleet review in Sydney Harbour, the largest collection of RAN ships since the Australian Bicentenary in 1988. Sirius did not participate in the fleet entry, but was anchored in the harbour for the review. In 2010, Sirius was approved to carry and deploy boarding parties.Gillett, Australia's Navy, Part 2, p. 50 This capability was tested during Exercise Kakadu 10, along with the ship's first ever dual replenishment. Sirius was forced to turn back en route to the RIMPAC 2010 exercise in Hawaii due to problems with her engine, and did not participate in the exercise as a result. The tanker completed a six-month maintenance period in Sydney on 16 September 2014; she spent five months of this period out of the water in the Captain Cook Graving Dock. HMAS Sirius joined HMAS Stuart, KDB Darulehsan, USS Rafael Peralta and RSS Supreme on their way to Pearl Harbor, Hawaii in preparation for RIMPAC 2020 on 6 August. RIMPAC 2020 will scheduled to start on 17 August. End of service Sirius was originally expected to remain in service for approximately 15 years. In 2012, the ship was predicted to remain in service until the early 2020s.Gillett, Australia's Navy, Part 2, p. 51 The 2013 Defence White Paper stated that the replacement of Sirius and would be brought forward. As well as building replacement vessels (either in Australia, overseas, or a combination), leasing existing vessels was also to be considered. In June 2014, the Minister for Defence announced that two companies had been invited to a restricted tender competition. Spanish shipbuilder Navantia is offering the design, while South Korea's DSME is proposing the downsized Aegir variant of the Tide-class tanker. The 20,000+ tonne ships will be built overseas, as they will be too large to build in Australian shipyards. Australia considered the design for their replacement tankers, with Navantia competing against the Aegir variant of the Tide-class tanker built by South Korea's DSME in a restricted tender competition. Navantia's proposal based on Cantabria was announced as the successful design in the Australian tender in March 2016, with an expected in service date for the first of two Supply-class replenishment oilers late 2020. The effects of COVID-19 on the Spanish workforce has delayed the delivery of the first vessel () and may extend the period of service into late 2021.

It is located about 95 km north-west of Harare on the main Harare-Chinhoyi road. According to the 1982 Population Census, the town had a population of 5,698. The name of the town is derived from banket rock formation: early settlers saw a conglomerate, which they hoped would bear gold, like the banket of the Witwatersrand gold fields.Stagman, J.G. 1961. The Geology of the Country around Sinoia and Banket, Lomagundi District. Southern Rhodesia Geological Survey Bulletin 49. ASIN: B0017ZS932. The conglomerate was not gold-bearing, although gold was late discovered and, along with chromite, is still mined in the area. Cattle, maize, cotton and tobacco are commercially farmed in the area. Banket grew as a service centre for the surrounding mines and commercial farms, and has suffered from the downscaling of chromite mining in Zimbabwe. The town further suffered from the expropriation of white-owned commercial farms in the controversial land reform programme that began in 2000. The town's main source of income and business clientele, the farmers and businesspeople, all but disappeared from the scene, leading to a loss of business and income. The settlers who took over the farms failed to fill the gap created by the demise of commercial farms. This led to the collapse of retail businesses and the few industries that were in the town. The town has three primary schools (Kuwadzana, St Georges and Banket Primary) and two secondary schools (Kuwadzana High School and the Catholic-church-owned Sacred Heart Secondary School). It has a district hospital and a council clinic. The town grew primarily because of its role as a service centre for surrounding commercial farms and mining settlements. Mazvikadei Dam is also located north of Banket. Government and politics Before the 1992 amalgamation of the rural councils, which managed mainly commercial farm land, and district councils, which managed mainly land held under traditional tenure, Banket- Trelawney Rural Council (BTRC) ran the small town. Services were good and infrastructure was solid . But there was a discrepancy in the level and quality of services between the white commercial farms and mainly white low density suburbs and the black high-density, low-income residential township of Kuwadzana. The amalgamation resulted in the creation of the Zvimba Rural District Council (ZRDC), with the head office being located at Murombedzi growth point. Crispen Kadhoza (ZANU-PF) served as councillor for Banket in ZRDC until losing ZANU-PF primary elections in 2008, and could therefore not represent the party in the electoral contest of 29 March, which was won by the MDC's Fanuel Tembo and Emmanuel Chinanzvavana who became the councillors for the two wards. In 2008 Banket gained international fame following a series of politically motivated abductions of supporters of the opposition party. These included the councillors Fanuel Tembo, Emmanuel Chinanzvavana, his wife Concillia Chinanzvavana and an infant who was abducted with the mother.

Callum (born 19 November 1958) is a Scottish automobile designer who is currently Vice President, Design for Ford Motor Company. His elder brother Ian Callum was the Design Director of Jaguar from 1999 to 2019. Early years Callum was born in Dumfries, Scotland. He initially intended to become a veterinarian, though by university age Callum elected to study architecture at Napier University in Edinburgh before becoming disillusioned with the prospect of calculating the size of waste pipes of seven-story buildings for the rest of his life.'A Golden Touch That Runs in the Family', Phil Patton, The New York Times 25 Oct 2006 , accessed 16 Apr 2016 He changed disciplines and graduated in industrial design and followed the well-trodden car designer path of continuing his studies at the Royal College of Art in London, graduating with a master's degree in transportation design. Career =Early career= Upon graduation, Callum's car design career began in 1982 where he worked for Chrysler before joining PSA Peugeot Citro√´n advanced studio in Poissy, France, contributing to the design of passenger and commercial vehicles. In 1988/1989, Callum joined Ghia as a consultant designer where he contributed to the 1989 Ghia Via concept and the Aston Martin Lagonda Vignale. He also participated in Ghia's design consultancy to Jaguar.'Who's Where: Moray Callum', Car Design News, 30 Apr 2002 , accessed 04/02/07 =Ford= In 1995 Callum was hired by Ford, for whom he had worked on numerous projects at Ghia, to work in Dearborn, Michigan, on North American vehicles. He worked on various notable North American projects including the facelift of the 2000 Ford Taurus, whose front grille design has been mischievously cited by some critics as the inspiration for his brother's 2006 Jaguar XK design, as opposed to the Jaguar E-Type which inspired both. He also did work on the Ford Windstar, Mercury Villager, Super Duty pickup trucks, Ford Excursion, and the Ford EX concept. =Mazda= On 7 September 2001, Callum was promoted to lead Mazda worldwide design, where his team included Tsutomu \\"Tom\\" Matano, the designer of the Mazda MX-5. Callum was tasked with revitalising the Mazda range, which by the late 1990s was regarded as bland, and in this respect Callum has largely been viewed as successful'Industry: Designer reshuffle at Ford', 4Car News, Channel 4, 2 May 2006 , accessed 4 Feb 2007 with the creation of a consistent brand look that featured 'crisp black interiors and red-lighted instruments' and exteriors with 'edgy shapes that were emotional and almost biological ‚Äì part flame, part flower, expressive of the sporting image the company sought'. He oversaw the daunting 2005 redesign of the iconic MX-5 and worked on almost every other vehicle in Mazda's passenger car range including the 2006 Mazda5. He was also responsible for leading the design of Mazda's new sporty crossovers, the 2007 CX-7 and CX-9 which were previewed by the 2005 Mazda MX-Crossport concept. He was also instrumental in the production of the Washu (Detroit 2003), Ibuki (Tokyo 2003), and Kabura (Detroit 2006) concept cars.'Mazda Magician Moray Callum Named Head of Ford Design', Inside Line, Edmunds, 3 May 2006 , accessed 4 Feb 2007 =Return to Ford= Having overseen Mazda's successful reinvention as a dynamic and sporty brand, Callum was moved by J Mays back to Ford as Design Director for Ford's North American brands passenger cars where he reported to Peter Horbury from May 2006. This move, along with Horbury's appointment as Executive Design Director for Ford North American brands, was part of Ford's attempt to consolidate its ‚ÄòRed, White & Bold‚Äô design strategy in an attempt to breathe fresh design into its expanding car line-up in North America. Callum was replaced at Mazda by Laurens van den Acker whilst his predecessor Patrick Schiavone was appointed designer of North American SUVs and pick-ups at Ford.

Brachyury functions as a transcription factor within the T-box family of genes. Brachyury homologs have been found in all bilaterian animals that have been screened, as well as the freshwater cnidarian Hydra.  History  The brachyury mutation was first described in mice by Nadezhda Alexandrovna Dobrovolskaya-Zavadskaya in 1927 as a mutation that affected tail length and sacral vertebrae in heterozygous animals. In homozygous animals the brachyury mutation is lethal at around embryonic day 10 due to defects in mesoderm formation, notochord differentiation and the absence of structures posterior to the forelimb bud (Dobrovolska√Øa-Zavadska√Øa, 1927). The name brachyury comes from the Greek brakhus meaning short and oura meaning tail. In 2018 HGNC updated the human gene name from T to TBXT, presumably to overcome difficulties associated with searching for a single letter gene symbol. It is assumed that the mouse nomenclature will also be updated in due course. The mouse T gene was cloned by Bernhard Herrmann and colleagues and proved to encode a 436 amino acid embryonic nuclear transcription factor. T binds to a specific DNA element, a near palindromic sequence TCACACCT through a region in its N-terminus, called the T-box. T is the founding member of the T-box family which in mammals currently consists of 18 T-box genes. The crystal structure of the human brachyury protein was solved in 2017 by Opher Gileadi and colleagues at the Structural Genomics Consortium in Oxford. Brachyury expression in 7.5dpc CD1 mouse embryos  Role in Development  The gene brachyury appears to have a conserved role in defining the midline of a bilaterian organism, and thus the establishment of the anterior-posterior axis; this function is apparent in chordates and molluscs. Its ancestral role, or at least the role it plays in the Cnidaria, appears to be in defining the blastopore. It also defines the mesoderm during gastrulation. Tissue-culture based techniques have demonstrated one of its roles may be in controlling the velocity of cells as they leave the primitive streak. It effects transcription of genes required for mesoderm formation and cellular differentiation. Brachyury has also been shown to help establish the cervical vertebral blueprint during fetal development. The number of cervical vertebrae is highly conserved among all mammals; however a spontaneous vertebral and spinal dysplasia (VSD) mutation in this gene has been associated with the development of six or fewer cervical vertebrae instead of the usual seven. = Expression = In mice T is expressed in the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage embryo (but not in the majority of mouse embryonic stem cells) followed by the primitive streak (see image). In later development expression is localised to the node and notochord. In Xenopus laevis Xbra (the Xenopus T homologue, also recently renamed t) is expressed in the mesodermal marginal zone of the pre- gastrula embryo followed by localisation to the blastopore and notochord at the mid-gastrula stage. = Orthologs = The Danio rerio ortholog is known as ntl (no tail)  Role in disease  = Cancer = Brachyury is implicated in the initiation and/or progression of a number of tumor types including chordoma, germ cell tumors, hemangioblastoma, GIST, lung cancer, small cell carcinoma of the lung, breast cancer, colon cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, prostate cancer, and oral squamous carcinoma. In breast cancer brachyury expression is associated with recurrence, metastasis and reduced survival. It is also associated with resistance to tamoxifen and to cytotoxic chemotherapy. In lung cancer brachyury expression is associated with recurrence and decreased survival. It is also associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy, radiation, and EGFR kinase inhibitors. In prostate cancer brachyury expression is associated with Gleason score, perineural, invasion and capsular invasion. It is also associated with resistance to cytotoxic chemotherapy. In addition to its role in common cancers, brachyury has been identified as a definitive diagnostic marker, key driver and therapeutic target for chordoma, a rare malignant tumor that arises from remnant notochordal cells lodged in the vertebrae. The evidence regarding brachyury's role in chordoma includes: * Brachyury is highly expressed in all chordomas except for the dedifferentiated subtype, which accounts for less than 5% of cases * Germ line duplication of the brachyury gene is responsible for familial chordoma. * A germline SNP in brachyury is present in 97% of chordoma patients. * Somatic amplifications of brachyury are seen in a subset of sporadic chordomas either by aneuploidy or focal duplication. * Brachyury is the most selectively essential gene in chordoma relative to other cancer types. * Brachyury is associated with a large superenhancer in chordoma tumors and cell lines, and is the most highly expressed superenhancer-associated transcription factor. Brachyury is an important factor in promoting the epithelial‚Äìmesenchymal transition (EMT). Cells that over-express brachyury have down-regulated expression of the adhesion molecule E-cadherin, which allows them to undergo EMT. This process is at least partially mediated by the transcription factors AKT and Snail. Overexpression of brachyury has been linked to Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC, also called malignant hepatoma), a common type of liver cancer. While brachyury is promoting EMT, it can also induce metastasis of HCC cells. Brachyury expression is a prognostic biomarker for HCC, and the gene may be a target for cancer treatments in the future. = Other diseases = Overexpression of brachyury may play a part in EMT associated with benign disease such as renal fibrosis.  Role as a therapeutic target  Because brachyury is expressed in tumors but not in normal adult tissues it has been proposed as a potential drug target with applicability across tumor types. In particular, brachyury-specific peptides are presented on HLA receptors of cells in which it is expressed, representing a tumor specific antigen. Various therapeutic vaccines have been developed which are intended to stimulate an immune response to brachyury expressing cells.

He is an Australian- born higher education administrator and academic who became the inaugural Chief Executive of the UK's Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC) in 2005, remaining in that role until 2009. From 1995 to 2010 he was Professor of Biblical Criticism at St Andrews University. From 1998 to 2001 he was Vice- Principal for Research and Provost of St Leonard‚Äôs College at St Andrews. During the years 1999 to 2003 he served as a member of the Board of Scottish Enterprise Fife. From October 2010 to March 2013 he was Principal at St Mary‚Äôs University College Twickenham. He had an earlier career as a lawyer, working in Sydney during 1978-81 and 1984-92 as an articled clerk, then solicitor and barrister. Esler is a leading figure with an international reputation in the field of social-scientific interpretation of biblical texts. He applies ideas and perspectives from disciplines such as social psychology, anthropology and sociology to Old and New Testament texts to gain a better sense of what they meant to their original audiences. He has also published in the areas of New Testament theology and the Bible and the visual arts. He holds a Doctor of Divinity from the University of Oxford, by submitted work (2008), and is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh (elected 2009). Life, career and scholarship Born in Sydney, Australia on 27 August 1952, Esler completed secondary schooling at the then named Marist Brothers High School in the Sydney suburb of Eastwood. He read English, Greek and Law at the University of Sydney (B.A. Hons, LL.B) from 1971 to 1977. During 1977 he also worked as Associate to Mr Justice W. H. Collins of the New South Wales Supreme Court. From 1978 to 1981 he was employed as an articled clerk and solicitor at Allen, Allen and Hemsley, at the same time completing undergraduate Hebrew at Sydney University on a non-degree basis (1978-1980) and undertaking part of an LLM. In 1979 he and four others established National Outlook, an Australian Christian ecumenical monthly magazine devoted to justice and peace issues.http://www.frbruceduncan.com/index2.php?option=com_docman&task;=doc_view&gid;=256&Itemid;=29 In October 1981 Esler went to Magdalen College, Oxford and undertook a D. Phil in New Testament. At that time the new movement to apply social-scientific ideas and perspectives in biblical interpretation was gaining momentum. Esler adopted this broad approach in his doctorate and applied ideas from the sociology of knowledge and of sectarianism to investigate how social and political factors had affected the way Luke wrote his Gospel and the Acts of the Apostles. Thus Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann‚Äôs The Social Construction of Reality supplied the idea that Luke was legitimating a new social and religious movement to its members in the late first century AD. Esler‚Äôs doctoral thesis was accepted by Oxford in 1984 and a modified version was published by Cambridge University Press in 1987. In 1984 Esler returned to Sydney, initially as a solicitor at Allen, Allen and Hemsley before being called to the Bar in 1986. He completed his LLM in these years. In 1985 he began teaching New Testament courses on a part-time basis at Sydney University. In 1990 Esler attended a meeting in Portland, Oregon of a group of mainly US biblical critics committed to social-scientific interpretation.Philip F. Esler, \\"The Context Group Project: An Autobiographical Account\\", in Mario Aguilar and Louise Lawrence, eds, Anthropology and Biblical Studies: Avenues of Research. Leiden: Deo Publishing, 2004, 46-61. At this meeting those present formally constituted themselves as \\"The Context Group: A Project for the Study of the Bible in its Socio-Cultural Context\\".The Context Group Although of diverse interests, all members accepted the importance of Mediterranean anthropology in understanding the context of ancient Greco-Roman world. Esler remains a member of the Context Group and has written on its history and modus operandi. In 1992 Esler was appointed Reader in New Testament in St Andrews University, becoming Professor of Biblical Criticism there in 1995. At St Andrews Esler initially published research which drew on his initial focus on the sociology of knowledge and of sectarianism and his expanding interests in Mediterranean anthropology, millennialism and magic.Philip F. Esler, The First Christians in Their Social Worlds: Social-Scientific Approaches to New Testament Interpretation (1994) Esler returned to the application of Mediterranean anthropology to biblical texts in Sex, Wives, and Warriors: Reading Biblical Narrative With Its Ancient Audience (2011).See review: http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/hls.2011.0017 Esler has formulated an approach called ‚Äòarchival ethnography‚Äô to assist in the interpretation of the legal papyri from 70 to 200 CE that survive from caves in the Dead Sea region.Philip F. Esler, Babatha‚Äôs Orchard: The Yadin Papyri and An Ancient Jewish Family Tale Retold (Oxford: OUP, 2017). In 2018 he applied the anthropology and sociology of gossip to the Book of Ruth in an article in the Journal of Biblical Literature,Philip F. Esler, \\"‚ÄòAll That You Have Done ‚Ä¶ Has Been Fully Told to Me‚Äô: The Power of Gossip and the Story of Ruth\\", Journal of Biblical Literature (2018) 137:645-666 an article that attracted a positive comment in a statement from the outgoing editor of the journal.https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.15699/jbl.1374.2018.foreword?seq=1 In the mid-1990s Esler began using both the social identity theory of social psychologist Henri Tajfel and the approach to ethnic identity of anthropologist Fredrik Barth and these have been prominent in his research since then. In 1996 he published an essay applying social identity theory and Barth‚Äôs ideas on ethnicity to Galatians.Philip F. Esler, \\"Group Boundaries and Intergroup Conflict in Galatians: A New Reading of Gal. 5:13-6:10\\", in Mark Brett, ed., Ethnicity and the Bible, (Leiden: E J Brill, 1996), 215-240. This was the first published application of social identity theory in New Testament studies.Jack Barentsen, Emerging Leadership in the Pauline Mission: A Social Identity Perspective on Local Leadership Development in Corinth and Ephesus (2011), p. 41. Social identity theory has now become a widely used approach in New Testament interpretation.See Social Identity Approaches to the New Testament, edited by Coleman A. Baker and J. Brian Tucker (London: T & T Clark), now in press. Esler applied both social identity theory and ideas on ethnicity in Galatians (1998) and Conflict and Identity in Romans (2003). He has recently argued for the need to take seriously the reality of Judean ethnic identity in the ancient Mediterranean world and its asymmetrical relationship to Christ-movement socio-religious identity in the interpretation of New Testament texts.Philip F. Esler, \\"Judean Ethnic Identity in Josephus‚Äô Against Apion\\", in A Wandering Galilean: Essays in Honour of Sean Freyne, edited by Zuleika Rodgers with Margaret Daly-Denton and Anne Fitzpatrick McKinley (Leiden: Brill: 2009), 73-91; \\"Judean Ethnic Identity and the Purpose of Hebrews\\", in Method & Meaning: Essays on New Testament Interpretation in Honor of Harold A. Attridge, edited by Andrew B. McGowan and Kent Harold Richards (Atlanta, GA: Society of Biblical Literature, 2011), 469-89; and \\"Judean Ethnic Identity and the Matthean Jesus\\", in Jesus: Gestalt und Gestaltungen: FS F√ºr Gerd Theissen, edited by Petra von Gem√ºnden, David G. Horrell, and Max K√ºchler (NTOA; G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 2013). Esler also writes on the way that biblical stories have been represented in Western art, including his study of two Rembrandt depictions of Saul and David in 1998.Philip F. Esler, \\"The Madness of Saul: A Cultural Reading of 1 Samuel 8-31\\", in Exum, Cheryl J, and Moore, Stephen D, eds. Biblical Studies/Cultural Studies. (Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1998), 220 262. In 2004 he co- authored with artist Jane Boyd a book on the Vel√°zquez painting Christ with Martha and Mary in the National Gallery in London which was covered in The Independent on 18 February 2005 under the heading \\"Through the looking-glass: how a mirror explains the secrets of a masterpiece\\" (p. 3). A work Esler co- authored with Ronald A. Piper, Lazarus, Martha and Mary: A Social-Scientific and Theological Reading of John, contains a chapter on the Lazarus frescoes from the early Christian tombs in the Roman catacombs. More recently Esler has contributed a chapter on the biblical paintings of Welsh artist Ivor Williams to Imaging the Bible in Wales 1800-1975 (edited by Martin O‚ÄôKane and John Morgan-Guy). Esler‚Äôs understanding of the role of the Arts and Humanities Research Council on his appointment as its Chief Executive in 2005 appeared in an article in The Guardian. His developing views were reflected in the evidence he provided to the House of Commons Select Committee on Science and Technology at their introductory meeting with him on 28 February 2007 While at the AHRC, Esler also chaired the Network Board of HERA: Humanities in the European Research Area, an EU-funded network of national Research Funding Agencies for collaborative research in the humanities.http://www.esf.org/media-centre/ext-single-news/article/podcast- heras-prof-philip-esler-on-the-1st-european-conference-for-collaborative- humanities-res.html For much of his last year at the AHRC, Esler was involved in a major project on impact published in 2009 as Leading the World: The Economic Impact of UK Arts and Humanities Research. One of his initiatives in this project was commissioning essays by leading UK arts and humanities researchers on the public value of research in their areas. These were later edited by Jonathan Bate FBA and published in 2010 as The Public Value of the Humanities. While Chief Executive of the AHRC (2005-2009), Esler chaired the Research Councils UK Knowledge Transfer and Impact project that formulated an approach to impact that was then applied to Research Council grants. Impact was also later adopted, after some development, by the Higher Education Funding Council for England. Esler also brokered a collaborative agreement between all seven UK Research Councils and the Research Funding Agency of the State of S√£o Paulo in Brazil (\\"FAPESP\\"). This agreement was signed by him on behalf of the Research Councils and by the President of FAPESP on 15 September 2009.http://www.bv.fapesp.br/namidia/noticia/32170/ahrc-signs-groundbreaking- mou-brazil/http://www.fapesp.br/en/5340 This agreement was renewed for a further three years in September 2012http://www.rcuk.ac.uk/media/news/2012news/Pages/120926.aspx On 1 October 2010 Professor Esler became Principal and Professor of Biblical Interpretation at St Mary's University College, Twickenham.http://www.smuc.ac.uk/news/2010/056-new-principal.htm In 2012 St Mary‚Äôs was the subject of a QAA report into a degree programme in Clinical Hypnosis provided with a partner institution, a programme that Esler and the Senior Management later closed.http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/421128.articlehttp://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/419611.article In the same year a number of other issues related to the University College were widely reported in the press: opposition to the decision to merge two academic schools;http://www.thetablet.co.uk/latest- news/4581http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/09/25/top-historian- criticises-st-marys-for-grotesque-treatment-of-professor/ the unpopularity of the suspension of the head of one of those schools;http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/421270.article protests against the merger and senior management by some theological and other students at the University College and at the Catholic Bishops Conference of England and Wales;http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=21482 the legal proceedings preparatory to commencement of a defamation suit brought by Esler and two other members of staff against the editor of a Catholic news site, Josephine Siedleka (one of the three Catholic Women of the Year in 2012), proceedings from which Esler later withdrew;http://www.indcatholicnews.com/news.php?viewStory=21489 a vote of no confidence in Esler by the local branch of the Universities and Colleges Union (UCU).http://thetablet.co.uk/issue/1000338/classifieds From 2009 to 2015 Esler was one of fifteen members of the Council of the Society of Biblical Literature (SBL), one of the oldest learned societies in the US, with members from the US and other countries. On 22 January 2013 Esler announced that he would step down as Principal of St Mary's on 31 March 2013.

Early years Remco Wouter Campert was born in The Hague, son of writer and poet Jan Campert,Remco Campert on website of Berlin International Literature Festival author of the poem De achttien dooden, and actress Joekie Broedelet. His parents separated when he was three years old, causing him to sometimes live with either of his parents and sometimes his grandparents, depending on situations and circumstances. His father died in 1943 in a Nazi concentration camp, Neuengamme. Remco then went to live with his mother. They returned to Amsterdam after World War II in 1945, after having spent the three preceding years in the town of Epe. His writings In Amsterdam, he started a secondary education at the Amsterdam Lyceum, occasionally writing articles or drawing comics for the school's newspaper. As the years went on, he skipped more and more classes and spent increasing amounts of time in cinemas, jazz clubs or pubs. He finally left school without graduating. With Rudy Kousbroek, a school friend, he founded the magazine Braak in May 1950. Between 1949 and 1952 Campert drew cartoons for the Dutch magazine Mandrill and Het Parool and in the 1970s for Haagse Post too. In 1979 he drew comics for NRC Handelsblad. Campert married Freddie Rutgers in 1949, but they separated five years later. In order to finance his living, Campert resorted to writing commercial texts or jingles as well as translating foreign literary works. He later married author Fritzi ten Harmsen van der Beek (daughter of comics artist Harmsen van der Beek ), with whom he lived in Blaricum until 1957, when he returned to Amsterdam. He divorced his second wife and married Lucia van den Berg in 1961. They moved to Antwerp in 1964, but Campert returned to Amsterdam two years later. There, he met art gallery owner Deborah Wolf, with whom he lived until 1980. He has mostly kept quiet about his life in the following years, however, he once explained his situation in 1994, in an interview to Cees van Hoore, journalist of newspaper 'Nieuwsblad van het Noorden'. He was quoted as saying; \\"I don't choke myself. I'm my own best company. Whenever I lived together with someone, I felt like being underwater for days on end. To be together is to be twice alone and I don't need that. I'm more than happily married to my career.\\" By the end of the 1970s, he had written very little. He explained to journalist Jan Brokken of the Dutch newspaper Haagse Post: \\"I couldn't write for years on end. I didn't feel like it. I felt a physical repulsion towards it. I thought about it, but I was paralysed by doubts.\\" He resumed writing in 1979. He wrote Somberman's actie in 1985. From 1989 until 1995, Campert starred in theatres throughout the nation and beyond in a play he had created together with Jan Mulder (author and ex-football player). Their shows were based on both their literary works. 1995 was also the year he read his bestseller novel 'Het leven is vurrukkulluk' on the radio. Dutch people of older generations will most likely associate his name with CaMu, the partnership between Remco Campert and Jan Mulder that wrote daily front-page columns for national newspaper 'de Volkskrant' from 1995 until 2006. These columns traditionally have been bundled into books titled CaMu ....: Het jaaroverzicht van Remco Campert en Jan Mulder at the end of each year.

A set of many AIMs can be used to estimate the proportion of ancestry of an individual derived from each population. A single-nucleotide polymorphism is a modification of a single nucleotide base within a DNA sequence. There are an estimated 15 million SNP (Single-nucleotide polymorphism) sites (out of roughly 3 billion base pairs, or about 0.4%) from among which AIMs may potentially be selected. The SNPs that relate to ancestry are often traced to the Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA because both of these areas are inherited from one parent, eradicating complexities that come with parental gene recombination. SNP mutations are rare, so sequences with SNPs tend to be passed down through generations rather than altered each generation. However, because any given SNP is relatively common in a population, analysts must examine groups of SNPs (otherwise known as AIMS) to determine someone‚Äôs ancestry. Using statistical methods such as apparent error rate and Improved Bayesian Estimate, the set of SNPs with the highest accuracy for predicting a specific ancestry can be found. Examining a suite of these markers more or less evenly spaced across the genome is also a cost-effective way to discover novel genes underlying complex diseases in a technique called admixture mapping or mapping by admixture linkage disequilibrium. As one example, the Duffy Null allele (FY*0) has a frequency of almost 100% of Sub-Saharan Africans, but occurs very infrequently in populations outside of this region. A person having this allele is thus more likely to have Sub-Saharan African ancestors. North and South Han Chinese ancestry can be distinguished unambiguously using a set of 140 AIMS. Collections of AIMs have been developed that can estimate the geographical origins of ancestors from within Europe. Following the development of ancient DNA databases, ancient ancestry- informative marker (aAIM) were similarly defined as a single-nucleotide polymorphism that exhibits substantially different frequencies between different ancient populations. A set of aAIMs can be used to identify the ancestry of ancient populations and eventually quantify the genetic similarity to modern-day individuals.  Discovery and development  The discovery of ancestry-informative markers was made possible by the development of next generation sequencing, or NGS. NGS enables the study of genetic markers by isolating specific gene sequences. One such method for sequence extraction is the use restriction enzymes, specifically endonuclease, which modifies the DNA sequence. This enzyme can be used with DNA ligase (connecting two different DNA), modifying DNA by inserting DNA from other organism. Another method, cDNA sequencing, or RNA-seq, can also help to acquire information of the transcriptomes in a broad range of organisms and find SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms), within a DNA sequence.  Applications  Ancestry informative markers have a number of applications in genetic research, forensics, and private industry. AIMs that indicate a predisposition for diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and renal disease have been shown to reduce the effects of genetic admixture in ancestral mapping when using admixture mapping software. The differential ability of ancestry-informative markers allows scientists and researchers to narrow geographical populations of concern; for example, illegal organ trafficking can be traced to certain areas by comparing the samples taken from organ recipients and deciphering the foreign marker in their body. An array of private companies, such as 23andMe and AncestryDNA, provide cost-effective direct-to-consumers (DTC) genetic testing by analyzing ancestry informative markers to determine geographic origins. These private companies collect massive quantities of data such as biological samples and self-reported information from consumers, a practice known as biobanking, enabling their researchers to discover more insights on AIMs. Though AIM panels can be useful for disease screening, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) prevents the use of genetic information for insurance and workplace discrimination.  Medical research  Different ancestral traits and their affiliation to diseases can help scientists determine appropriate approaches of treatment for a specific population. Medical researchers have revealed the link between ancestry traits and some common diseases; for example, individuals of African descent have been found to be at higher risk of asthma than those of European ancestry. AIM panels can be used for detecting disease risk factors. One such panel was created for African American ancestry based on subsets of commercially available SNP arrays. These types of arrays can help reduce the cost of identifying risk factors, since they allow researchers to screen for ancestry markers instead of the entire genome. This is due to the fact that these SNP arrays narrow the scope of the necessary screening from hundreds of thousands of SNP markers to a panel of a few thousands of AIMs. While some believe that structured populations should be used in studies to better ascertain genetic associations to diseases, the social implications of the potential racial stigma that may result from such studies is a major concern. However, the study done by Yang et al. (2005) suggests that the technology to conduct deeper research into and identify ancestry-associated variations in human disease does already exist.

It includes APIs for both the Java and the C# programming languages. The APIs are supported by a registered Australian charitable organization: Legion of the Bouncy Castle Inc. Bouncy Castle is Australian in origin and therefore American restrictions on the export of cryptography from the United States do not apply to it.  History  Bouncy Castle started when two colleagues were tired of having to re-invent a set of cryptography libraries each time they changed jobs working in server-side Java SE. One of the developers was active in Java ME (J2ME at that time) development as a hobby and a design consideration was to include the greatest range of Java VMs for the library, including those on J2ME. This design consideration led to the architecture that exists in Bouncy Castle. The project, founded in May of 2000, was originally written in Java only, but later added a C# API in 2004. The original Java API consisted of approximately 27,000 lines of code, including test code and provided support for J2ME, a JCE/JCA provider, and basic X.509 certificate generation. In comparison, the 1.53 release consists of 390,640 lines of code, including test code. It supports the same functionality as the original release with a larger number of algorithms, plus PKCS#10, PKCS#12, CMS, S/MIME, OpenPGP, DTLS, TLS, OCSP, TSP, CMP, CRMF, DVCS, DANE, EST and Attribute Certificates. The C# API is around 145,000 lines of code and supports most of what the Java API does. Some key properties of the project are: * Strong emphasis on standards compliance and adaptability. * Public support facilities include an issue tracker, dev mailing list and a wiki all available at the website. * Commercial support provided under resources for the relevant API listed on the Bouncy Castle website On 18 October 2013, a not-for-profit association, the Legion of the Bouncy Castle Inc. was established in the state of Victoria, Australia, by the core developers and others to take ownership of the project and support the ongoing development of the APIs. The association was recognised as an Australian charity with a purpose of advancement in education and a purpose that is beneficial to the community by the Australian Charities and Not-For- Profits Commission on 7 November 2013. The association was authorised to fundraise to support its purposes on 29 November 2013 by Consumer Affairs Victoria.  Architecture  The Bouncy Castle architecture consists of two main components that support the base cryptographic capabilities. These are known as the 'light-weight' API, and the Java Cryptography Extension (JCE) provider. Further components built upon the JCE provider support additional functionality, such as PGP support, S/MIME, etc. The low-level, or 'light- weight', API is a set of APIs that implement all the underlying cryptographic algorithms. The APIs were designed to be simple enough to use if needed, but provided the basic building blocks for the JCE provider. The intent is to use the low-level API in memory constrained devices (JavaME) or when easy access to the JCE libraries is not possible (such as distribution in an applet). As the light-weight API is just Java code, the Java virtual machine (JVM) does not impose any restrictions on the operation of the code, and at early times of the Bouncy Castle history it was the only way to develop strong cryptography that was not crippled by the Jurisdiction Policy files that prevented JCE providers from performing \\"strong\\" encryption. The JCE- compatible provider is built upon the low-level APIs. As such, the source code for the JCE provider is an example of how to implement many of the \\"common\\" crypto problems using the low-level API. Many projects have been built using the JCE provider, including an Open Source Certificate Authority EJBCA.  Certified releases  The C# and Java releases now have FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified streams as well. These differ from the regular releases in that, while the modules are designed in a similar fashion to the regular releases, the low-level APIs are quite different ‚Äì largely to support the enforcement of controls that FIPS requires when an algorithm is used. In the case of the JCE level of the Java API, the provider is still largely a drop-in replacement for the regular release. The first FIPS-certified releases were made available in November 2016, with the Java version being assigned certification number 2768 and the C# version being assigned certification number 2792.  Spongy Castle  The Android operating system, as of early 2014, includes a customized version of Bouncy Castle. Due to class name conflicts, this prevents Android applications from including and using the official release of Bouncy Castle as-is. A third-party project called Spongy Castle distributes a renamed version of the library to work around this issue.  Stripy Castle  Originally, it was assumed a FIPS 140-2 version of Spongy Castle could also be done. It turned out due to Android's DEX file processing that for FIPS purposes the provider needs to be installed on the device separate from the application. The FIPS 140-2 release for Android is now called Stripy Castle and is packaged under org.stripycastle. This was needed in order to avoid clashes with Android's version of Bouncy Castle as well as clashes for applications that might be using Spongy Castle and not requiring FIPS 140-2 certified services.

It was redesignated Air Anti-Submarine Squadron 32 (VS-32) on 20 April 1950. The squadron initially flew the Grumman TBM-3E/-3W Avenger and was based at Naval Air Station Norfolk, Virginia. In 1951 the squadron moved to Naval Air Station Quonset Point, Rhode Island. VS-32 transitioned to the Grumman S2F-1 Tracker in 1954. The VS community moved in October 1973 to the homeport located at Naval Air Station Cecil Field, Florida. The squadron participated in Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

In early 1975, VS-32 was maintaining S2Fs in Hangar 11 at NAS Cecil Field, Jacksonville. The Commanding Officer (CO) was CDR Ted Simpson, and the Executive Officer (XO), soon to be the CO, was CDR Procter. The Squadron was being repopulated by members that would receive the transition training to the new S-3As. During the course of the year, many members received training on common systems shared with the P-3C Orion at NAS Jacksonville, and also training on systems common to most Naval Aircraft. Many of the squadron members were chosen by the CO and XO for a particular training track. With a few exceptions, the squadron members were transported to NAS North Island in San Diego (Coronado Island) for transition training. There was a one-week layover at NAS Fallon, Nevada, due to the aircraft being needed for the final evacuation from Vietnam. The transition training was performed by technical representatives from Lockheed (Burbank), Sperry Univac, and other vendors. Classes were also instructed by naval personnel. On-the-job training was with VS-41, which was the Reserve Air Group squadron. The aircraft were S-3As, flown by pilots in training, crewed by TACCOs (Tactical Coordinator Officer), SENSOs (Sensor Operators), and a copilot who was responsible for radar, FLIR, and other supplemental systems. The aircraft were maintained by members of VS-32 with assistance from VS-41 personnel. Launch of a VS-32 S-2E from USS Wasp, 1969. By the end of the summer of 1975, many of the training tracks were complete, and many VS-32 members continued at VS-41 performing day-to-day operations. The first VS-32 S3A was delivered, and subsequently ferried to NAS Cecil Field by VS-32 personnel. The squadron returned to NAS Cecil Field en masse late 1975, and continued to receive new aircraft regularly. Bureau numbers (BUNOs) began with 159700 and ended with 159711. The purpose of having this number of aircraft, atypical for many sea going squadrons, was that one aircraft would essentially be used for parts, rather than a large purchase of spares alone. In 1976, preparations for working up to the first cruise with the S3 were begun. The squadron sailed on the USS John F. Kennedy out of NS Norfolk, Virginia. During these work-ups, almost the entire squadron personnel, manuals, tools, test equipment, etc. were transported to Norfolk to be loaded onto the Kennedy. After a few weeks of underway training and verification, they would return in entirety to Cecil Field for a short break before returning to the ship. In August 1976 the squadron began moving members and aircraft to Norfolk for a North Atlantic cruise. From September to December 9, they deployed to the North Atlantic for flight operations and training for winter operations. There were opportunities to hunt for potentially hostile submarines. There were a number of successful detections, tracking, identification, and recording on audio and digital tape of Soviet and other submarines. In addition there were a few visual sightings. The S-3A was shown to be an accurate platform for Anti-submarine warfare. An S-3A of VS-32 assigned to CVW-1 aboard USS America in 1982 There were flight ops north of the Arctic Circle, with flight deck personnel in extreme cold- weather gear. Aircrew members wore poopy suits in case of emergency ejections. During the cruise, the Kennedy visited Edinburgh, Scotland, Wilhelmshaven, Germany, Brest, France, and Portsmouth, England. VS-32 suffered its first major incident when there was an explosive decompression at night at . The co- pilot broke his left arm when the top canopy on co-pilot's side blew off. The pilot was blinded in one eye by debris. All radio communication was lost 150 miles from the ship. They made a low pass over the ship, waving wings to indicate that they needed to land. They made a ready deck, and landed successfully with F.O.D. (Foreign Object Damage) in both engines. They returned to the ship with a near-perfect recovery. His blindness was temporary, and he returned to flight status shortly thereafter. On 20 February 1991, during Operation Desert Storm, the 's VS-32 became the first S-3 squadron to engage, bomb and destroy a hostile vessel‚Äìan Iraqi gunboat. During its final deployment in 2007, VS-32 aircraft flew 960 sorties, which totaled more than 2,200 flight hours, and included more than 950 carrier landings. Squadron VS-32 operated at sea for 180 days with 13 days spent in port. VS-32 was officially deactivated effective 30 September 2008 in a deactivation ceremony on 25 September 2008.

It was directed by independent film maker Steve Pallotta and featured an appearance by Brian Lisik. Tom Erickson of WNIR also stars in the movie. The film is considered a \\"local cult favorite\\". Production At the 2004 debut of Pallotta's film Lake Evermore, Palotta announced his plans to film Circle Track Summer as \\"a launching pad for a commercial filmmaking career\\", with plans to have it air on a cable network and eventually be released to home video. Filming occurred over a 14-month period (2005‚Äì2006) at the Barberton Raceway in Barberton, Ohio. With most of cast and crew working for free, the film was made on a micro-budget of under $10,000, and was one of the first independent films shot by cinematographer Christopher Parker on the Panasonic DVX100 digital video camera. The film was edited in a room in the director's house and music was provided by musician friends of the director. Circle Track Summer is Steve Pallotta's third full-length feature, following his first two movies The Forbidden Closet and Lake Evermore. With this project, cinematographer Christopher Parker, takes his production level \\"up several notches\\". The project was shot entirely on location in the Akron, Ohio area, with more than 200 locals involved in the one-year filming. The project's costume design was done by Susie Smith, known for her award-winning work on St. Elsewhere. The filmed debuted July 29, and had a DVD release by CustomFlix on May 19, 2006. The film features WNIR radio talk show personalities, Stan Piatt, Maggie Fuller, Tom Erickson, Phil Fergusson, and Bob Earley. The film also includes cameo appearances by Akron Beacon-Journal columnist Bob Dyer, Bob Golic of Saved By the Bell: The College Years with additional cameos by Cuyahoga Falls then-mayor Don Robart and Nina Rawls, wife of Lou Rawls. Plot The owner of a failing race track seeks to reverse his fortune by holding a series of promotion events where the cars are driven by women. Becky (JodyMarie Spiech) is a waitress who unknowingly puts her life in danger while attempting to save the family farm. She had rediscovered her lost high-school sweetheart, reporter Scoop Hendrickson (Tony Rio), and must decide whether or not to tell him of what ended their romance. To raise money to save the farm, she and three other financially strapped but voluptuous local girls, Su Shi (Jenna Christie), Tammy Lay (Heather Ley) and Jette Black (Lindsay Robertson), sign up for a new Powder-Puff auto racing event at the Barberton Speedway in hopes of winning cold, hard cash. The promotional catch developed by the track owner is that the women must wear bikinis as they race, and must drive the cars backwards.

The strengths lie mostly in three things: the willingness of the filmmakers to take a chance by poking fun at every known stereotype of Ohioans, and especially of natives of Barberton; Pallotta‚Äôs ability to avoid crossing the fine line between localizing a story by using well-known landmarks or inside jokes and providing free advertising by referring to everything by its full name and location - something natives of an area never do; and the supporting players.\\" References External links * * Circle Track Summer at the Internet Movie Database * Circle Track Summer at the AllMovie * WKSU News Category:American films Category:American action comedy films Category:2005 action comedy films Category:American independent films Category:2005 films Category:American auto racing films Category:Films shot in Ohio Category:2005 comedy films Category:2005 independent films ","title":"Circle Track Summer"},{"id":"3637023","text":"Margaret Daphne Hampson (born 1944) is an English theologian. Educated at Oxford and at Harvard, she held a personal Chair in \\"Post-Christian Thought\\" at the University of St Andrews. Hampson's distinctive theological position has both gained her notoriety and been widely influential. Holding that Christianity is neither true nor moral (in not being gender inclusive), she believes the overcoming of patriarchal religion to be fundamental to human emancipation. As a theologian Hampson has always held to a \\"realist\\" position, in which the understanding of \\"that which is God\\" is based in human religious experience.  Biography  Hampson was born on 15 June 1944 in Croydon, England. Her background was in politics and modern history. Her Oxford doctorate on The British Response to the German Church Struggle, 1933‚Äì1939 was not without its impact on her: she was later to write that a Church which discriminated against women was no more to be considered 'Christian' than one that discriminated against non-Aryans.Theology and Feminism (Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1990), p. 30 From her early teens she had herself envisaged ordination. Following a year teaching British history, she went to Harvard as a Knox scholar (the second woman ever to enter the advanced degree programme in systematic theology). In 1974 she took up a post at the University of Stirling; from 1977 in theology at the University of St Andrews. Asking for baptism, she was also confirmed in the Anglican Church without being consulted. Now an insider, she took a lead in arguing in fundamental theological terms for the ordination of persons without respect to sex, writing the statement circulated to members of the Synod of the Church of England before the vote in 1979. With a growing feminist consciousness, in 1980 she left the church and, shortly after, Christianity, behind her as incompatible with human equality. It did not however occur to her that she should thereby cease to believe in God: indeed she comments that the move took her back to what essentially had been her formation at home and at her school.Theology and Feminism, p. 30 A frequent lecturer and occasional broadcaster, from the 1980s Hampson became known to a wider public. Many in the burgeoning women's movement in the church were challenged, or encouraged, by her thought. She was the first 'iconoclast' in the BBC Radio 4 series of that name. In 1986 she held a major debate with Rosemary Ruether on the compatibility of Christianity with feminism in Westminster Cathedral hall.Published as 'Is there a place for Feminists in a Christian Church?', New Blackfriars, 68, no.801 (Jan. 1987). At St Andrews, Hampson set up one of the first two courses on 'Feminism and Theology' in the UK. From 1985-88 she was the founding president of the European Society of Women in Theological Research, with branches in Eastern and many Western European countries. After taking a degree in Continental philosophy at the University of Warwick in 1992-93, she expanded the range of her teaching at St Andrews to include courses on 'Challenges to Christian Belief', 'Theology and Recent Continental Philosophy' (the first such undergraduate course in the UK) and a cross- disciplinary course in the Faculty of Arts in 'Feminist Theory'. In 2002 she was awarded a personal chair and shortly afterwards, worn out from the situation she had for many years encountered in her job, took early retirement. Hampson has since lived in Oxford, where she is an Associate of the Faculty of Theology, undertaking some teaching and continuing to publish. In 2005 Hampson was a Visiting Fellow at Clare Hall, Cambridge, and is now a Life Member.  Thought  Hampson is unusual in being both schooled in Continental thought, thus having a post-Kantian, post-Freudian and feminist ideological critique of Christianity, and also a marked British empirical streak, holding that theology should be grounded in human religious experience. It would be misleading to regard her as predominantly a polemical thinker. Rather is her thought characterized by a desire for reasoned judgments as to what can be the case. She is adamant that Christian claims to a unique revelation in Christ are incompatible with what, since the eighteenth century Enlightenment, has been known to be the nature of reality. Hence she contends that the Christian myth must be discarded; while also allowing that it has served as a 'vehicle' which has carried human religious sensibilities.Cf. After Christianity (second edn. London, SCM Press, 2002), ch. I 'Christian Particularity'; 'Kant and the Present', in ed. P. S. Anderson New Topics in Feminist Philosophy of Religion (New York: Springer, 2010) As she points out, a theology which makes no such claim to a particular revelation, in which God is rather conceived as everywhere and at all times available, while expanding a secular Enlightenment paradigm as to what is possible does not contravene the recognition that nature and history form a (non-determinative) causal nexus. She has long taken such an epistemological position for granted. As a 19-year-old on the radio, she challenged a panel as to how the Bible could be considered anything other than literature among other religious literature, the record of people's awareness of God. Hampson compounds such an epistemological position with an ethical critique of Christianity. From the belief there has been a unique revelation in history it follows that Christians must constantly refer back to that past age. The values and outlook of that patriarchal age, in its constant reiteration, come to form the religious subconscious, affecting present-day relations between men and women.Cf. Theology and Feminism, ch. 3 'The Concretion of Religion'; After Christianity, ch. 2 'Continuity and Discontinuity'. Hampson further finds problematic the idea of a transcendent God; again the corollary of a belief in particular revelation. The relationship to such scripture, or to such a God, must necessarily be heteronomous.Cf. her 'On Autonomy and Heteronomy', in ed. Hampson, Swallowing a Fishbone? Feminist Theologians Debate Christianity (London, SPCK, 1996), pp. 1-16. At a later date feminist appropriation of G. W. F. Hegel came to be crucial for Hampson's critique of Christianity.See for example 'Searching for God?' in eds. M. McGhee and J. Cornwell, Philosophers and God: At the Frontiers of Faith and Reason (London and New York: Continuum International Publishing Group, 2009). Prompted by Luce Irigaray's building on the thought of Ludwig Feuerbach, Hampson came to hold that religious thought-structures are a masculinist projection, both reflecting and serving to legitimise male superordination; and thus a form of fascism.'Searching for God?', p.70; 'The Sacred, The Feminine and French Feminist Theory', in eds. G. Pollock and V. Turvey Sauron, The Sacred and the Feminine (London and New York, I. B. Tauris, 2007) pp. 61-64. Hampson would have theology become like any other discipline; drawing on the past when that remains appropriate, taking novel directions when the progress of human knowledge or ethics demands this.After Christianity, pp. 51, 57. The more challenging aspect of Hampson's thought has been to consider (if the Christian myth is to be dismissed), how then 'God' had best be conceptualised. Hampson has always been forthright as to her belief that prayer, or focused thought for another, is effective. It is the conviction that there is such a dimension to reality, Hampson has said, that led her to abandon secular history for theology.Cf. After Christianity, pp. 222-30 'God', for her, is the name that humans have given to their awareness (anthropomorphising it) of this reality. Hampson holds that God had best be understood as spirit, intimately interconnected with what we are. Drawing on the thought of Schleiermacher and feminist writing, she suggests that a 'porous' and relational understanding of the self may allow us to envisage how humans and 'that which is God' are inter-related.The most extensive working out of such a theological position remains of After Christianity, ch. 6 'A Future Theism', but see also 'That Which is God' in eds. G. Howie and J. Jobling, Women and the Divine (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2009). (Whether 'God' has agency, or would exist if humans did not, remain for her open questions.) It is this theological realism which those of more traditional beliefs have often recognised as being held in common. For her part Hampson always insists that the definition of what it is to be Christian necessarily involves an epistemological claim; what is no more than an ethical outlook cannot on its own constitute Christianity.After Christianity ch. I 'Christian Particularity'; which considers also Kierkegaard's Philosophical Fragments. Academically, Hampson has always been impressed by the power of Lutheran thought, little known or appreciated in the British context. She has found herself over many years existentially involved with the differing (and as she believes incompatible) structures of Lutheran and Catholic thought and their resulting spiritualities; the subject of her Harvard doctorate. She is fascinated by Luther's originality, over-turning philosophical presuppositions inherited from the ancient world and setting theology on another course. Hampson finds the Lutheran tradition best able to respond to the dilemma with which the Enlightenment confronts Christians. From the early 1970s she has been fascinated by the thought of Kierkegaard; in particular his Philosophical Fragments as that text which clarified the necessary clash of Christianity with modernity. Her most recent book is Kierkegaard: Exposition and Critique. Thinking Rudolf Bultmann's position the most adequate attempt to mount an apologetic for Christianity in modernity, she judges it however to fail.See her Christian Contradictions: The Structures of Lutheran and Catholic Thought (Cambridge University Press, 2001, paperback 2004); for Bultmann see ch. 6 'Dialogue with Bultmann'. Among major theologians, it is Schleiermacher (not a Lutheran) to whom Hampson returns once and again in appreciation.Cf. After Christianity pp. 212-22; also 'Re- review: Friedrich Schleiermacher, On Religion: Speeches to the Cultured Among Its Despisers' in Modern Believing, vol. 40, no. 4 (October 1999).

He was elected President of the Senate in 2014. On 31 October 2017, Parry informed the government that he may be a British citizen, and issued his intention to resign from his position if dual nationality was confirmed. The next day he reported that he had received confirmation of his dual citizenship and, on 2 November, he resigned as president and from the Senate. He was replaced in the Senate by next Liberal Party Tasmanian Senate candidate and former senator Richard Colbeck after a recount. Early life Parry was born on 31 October 1960 in Burnie, Tasmania, to William Stephen (\\"Bill\\") Parry (1940‚Äì2015) and Patricia Dawn Evans; his father had been born in Liverpool, UK and had emigrated to Australia in the 1950s. He was educated at Burnie's Marist Regional College, after which he enrolled at the Tasmania Police Academy in Hobart. Career Parry was employed as an officer with the Tasmanian Police from 1977 to 1986, and was promoted to detective in 1983. After leaving the police force, he completed a certificate in Mortuary Science at the Australian College of Funeral Service, and was a funeral director from 1986 to 2004, becoming president of the Australian Funeral Directors Association. Parry performed a significant role in the wake of the 1996 Port Arthur massacre, acting as the Team Leader of the Embalming Team. Parry was also president of the Burnie Chamber of Commerce and Industry from 2000 to 2004, and a director of the Tasmanian Chamber of Commerce and Industry from 2000 to 2005. Politics In 2004, Parry was elected to the Australian Senate for the state of Tasmania as a member of the Liberal Party of Australia. He was elected government deputy whip in the Senate in November 2006 and government whip in April 2007 in succession to the late Senator Jeannie Ferris. Senator Parry was elected opposition whip after the 2007 federal election, and on 16 February 2009, in addition to his role as whip, he was appointed manager of opposition business in the Senate. On 4 July 2011, Parry was elected by the Senate as the deputy president and chairman of committees, replacing Alan Ferguson. On 7 July 2014 the Senate elected him as its president. On 31 October 2017 Parry informed the government he believed he may be a British citizen through descent, which would disqualify him from sitting in Parliament under Section 44 of the Constitution. The next day he confirmed he did indeed hold dual British-Australian citizenship and announced he would be resigning as senate president and Senator for Tasmania on 2 November 2017. Upon the election of his successor, there was all-party praise for Parry's performance as President. Parry's senate position was filled by Richard Colbeck who was sworn in on 12 February 2018. Post-politics In 2019, Parry was appointed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as a part-time member with an initial term of seven years.

Though consequences of the English Reformation were felt in Ireland and Scotland as well, this article only covers those who died in the Kingdom of England. On 25 February 1570, Pope Pius V's \\"Regnans in Excelsis\\" bull excommunicated the English Queen Elizabeth I, and any who obeyed her. This papal bull also required all Roman Catholics to rebel against the English Crown as a matter of faith. In response, in 1571 legislation was enacted making it treasonable to be under the authority of the Pope, including being a Jesuit, being Roman Catholic or harbouring a Roman Catholic priest. The standard penalty for all those convicted of treason at the time was execution by being hanged, drawn and quartered. In the reign of Pope Gregory XIII (1572‚Äì85), authorisation was given for 63 recognised martyrs to have their relics honoured and pictures painted for Roman Catholic devotions. These martyrs were formally beatified by Pope Leo XIII, 54 in 1886 and the remaining nine in 1895. Further groups of martyrs were subsequently documented and proposed by Roman Catholic bishops of England and Wales and formally recognised by Rome.

Retrieved 2012-02-19. Responding to Pius V's action, Elizabeth I's government passed anti-Roman Catholic decrees in 1571 forbidding anyone from maintaining the jurisdiction of the pope by word, deed or act; requiring use of the Book of Common Prayer in all cathedrals, churches and chapels, and forbidding criticism of it; forbidding the publication of any bull, writing or instrument of the Holy See (the death penalty was assigned to this); and prohibiting the importing of Agnus Dei images, crosses, pictures, beads or other things from the Bishop of Rome. Later laws made illegal the drawing of anyone away from the state church; non-attendance at a Church of England church; raising children with teachers who were not licensed by an Anglican diocesan bishop; and attending or celebrating the Roman Catholic Mass. In 1585, a new decree made it a crime punishable by death to go overseas to receive the sacrament of Ordination to the Roman Catholic priesthood. Nicholas Devereux (who went by the alias of Nicholas Woodfen) and Edward Barber (see below Edward Stransham) were both put to death in 1586 under this law. William Thomson and Richard Lea (see below Richard Sergeant) were hanged, disembowelled and quartered under the same law. In 1588, eight priests and six laymen at Newgate were condemned and executed under this law. =1570‚Äì1603= * William Hambledon, priest, 1585 * John MacMahon, Jesuit priest, 1594The history and topography of the county of Clare, from the earliest times to the beginning of the 18th century, (1893), P67 - citing Anthony Bruodin, 'Propugnaculum Catholicae Veritatis', 1669 =1606‚Äì1680= * James Brown, Benedictine, 1645 Died in prison * Thomas Wood, priest, before 1588 See also * Elizabeth Barton#Arrest and execution * Carthusian Martyrs * Pilgrimage of Grace#Those executed after the Pilgrimage * Irish Catholic Martyrs * Marian persecutions  References  = Citations = = Sources = * Pendrill, Colin (2000), The English Reformation 1485-1558, Heinemann. * Pallen, C.B.; Wynne, J.J., eds.

Biography He was born on September 9, 1872 in Humpolec in Bohemia. He worked as a conductor in Prague and Berlin before being selected by the New York Philharmonic to replace Gustav Mahler on Mahler's death in 1911. Some commentators did not see Str√°nsk√Ω as a worthy successor to Mahler: the periodical Musical America wrote: An article in the New York Times about the appointment began: \\"The financial backers of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra will be interested to learn that the German artistic world is filled with astonishment over the engagement of Josef Stransky of Berlin as the successor to the late Gustav Mahler\\", before going on to allege that Str√°nsk√Ω was chosen over other candidates such as Oskar Fried and Bruno Walter because of his low financial demands. Stransky had the widest repertoire of any of the Philharmonic's previous conductors. Str√°nsk√Ω married Marie Doxrud (1881‚Äì1954), a soprano from Norway, in 1912. During his tenure with the Philharmonic, Str√°nsk√Ω received praise for his interpretations of Franz Liszt and Richard Strauss by the prominent critic Henry T. Finck of the New York Evening Post. However, Daniel Gregory Mason expressed his dissatisfaction with what he referred to as \\"the Wagnerian, Lisztian and Tschaikowskian pap ladled out to us by ... Stransky of the Phihamonic Society\\", and went as far as to call the conductor \\"a total musical incompetent\\". In an even more biting critique published in H. L. Mencken's American Mercury Magazine, critic D. W. Sinclair wrote Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York Mahler scholar Henry-Louis de La Grange has characterized Str√°nsk√Ω as a \\"conscientious but uninspiring\\" leader, who allowed the high performing levels achieved by Mahler to fall. From his installation in 1911 until the end of the 1919‚Äì20 season, Str√°nsk√Ω conducted every Philharmonic concert.Horowitz (2005), p. 278 He conducted the orchestra's first recordings, which were made for Columbia Records. He was elected an honorary member of Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia fraternity, the national fraternity for men in music, in 1917 by the fraternity's Alpha chapter at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1921 the Philharmonic merged with the National Symphony, conducted by Willem Mengelberg. For the 1922‚Äì23 season, Str√°nsk√Ω conducted the first half of the season and Mengelberg the second: Str√°nsk√Ω subsequently left the orchestra. =Art dealer= Str√°nsk√Ω ultimately left the musical profession to become an art dealer, specializing in Picasso's Rose Period. He was a partner in the art gallery E. Gimpel & Wildenstein in New York City. The gallery became Wildenstein & Company in 1933. Before his death, Str√°nsk√Ω amassed a private art collection that included more than 50 major impressionist and post- impressionist paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh, Gauguin, Renoir, Monet, Manet, Degas, C√©zanne, Matisse, Seurat, Toulouse-Lautrec, Pissarro, Sisley, Delacroix, Ingres, Corot, Courbet, Daumier, Derain, Boudin, Modigliani, Segonzac, Fantin-Latour, Vuillard, Utrillo, Vlaminck, Guys, Laurencin, Rouault, Gromaire, and others.\\"The Private Collection of Josef Stransky\\", The Art News, Volume XXIX, Number 33, New York, May 16, 1931, pp. 86-117. He also owned a large collection of old master paintings, and was a recognized authority on the old masters.From Maud Dale's introduction to \\"The Private Collection of Josef Stransky,\\" The Art News, Volume XXIX, Number 33, New York, May 16, 1931, pp. 86-117: \\"Josef Stransky retired at the height of his musical career in order to devote himself entirely to the fine arts. His hobby became his profession and his profession his hobby. A serious student of painting since his early youth, he is now known not only as a collector and fine judge of modern pictures but he has become a recognized authority on the works of the old masters.\\" Then, from Ralph Flint's segment of the introduction: \\"...long before he ever dreamed of occupying a seat on the New York Art Exchange, Stransky was a collector. Even in his student days when music was his ruling passion the acquisitive urge proved so irresistible that on one occasion he spent his entire holdings for a coveted painting. How many times he has repeated that early performance it would be difficult to say. ...today the Stransky collection stands as one of the finest, most comprehensively selected sequences of French art of the XVIIIth, XIXth, and XXth centuries that is to be met with either here or abroad. Considering the wide range and completeness of the Stransky collection it can only be hoped that it will be kept together in the years to come, for it should stand intact as a fitting memorial to a great collector and art lover.\\" Had this group of works remained intact and in private hands, today it would be one of the most valuable privately held art collections in the world.\\"Is this Jefferson?\\" isthisjefferson.org Accessed 4 February 2013. Recently, Str√°nsk√Ω was discovered to have owned for many years a 1785 painting by Nicolas Benjamin Delapierre that may be the earliest known portrait of Thomas Jefferson. It was sold by the estate of his widow (Marie D. Stransky) in October 1954.\\"Is this Jefferson?\\" isthisjefferson.org Accessed 4 February 2013. Str√°nsk√Ω died in New York City on March 6, 1936 and is buried at Woodlawn Cemetery in the Bronx, New York City. References Bibliography * Horowitz, Joseph. Classical Music in America.

Unlike the superior courts of Canada, the jurisdiction of the provincial courts is limited to those matters which are permitted by statute. They have no inherent jurisdiction. Appeals of provincial court decisions are usually heard by the superior court of the province. These courts typically evolved from older magistrate, municipal, or local courts. Many of these former courts were as likely to have lay magistrates or justices of the peace presiding as they were to have a judge who had formal legal training.

Some of these courts continued in some form after Canada and the United States became independent countries. These courts initially had general jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters. New York In New York, the Court of Quarter Sessions was established in October 17, 1683, by the first Assembly in New York. It had jurisdiction over both civil and criminal matters until 1691, when it was restricted to felony crimes not punishable by death or life imprisonment. The court was abolished in all counties of New York except New York County (now Manhattan) by the New York Constitution of 1846. In New York County, the Court of General Sessions continued until 1962 when its scope devolved to the New York Supreme Court (a trial-level court of general jurisdiction not to be confused with the highest court of the New York system, which is called the New York Court of Appeals). At the time when it was abolished, the Court of General Sessions of New York County was the oldest criminal court in the United States. Pennsylvania In Pennsylvania, the courts of general sessions in continued until the constitution of that Commonwealth was rewritten in 1968 and the courts' jurisdiction was placed under the pre-existing Courts of Common Pleas in each county. South Carolina The Court of General Sessions in South Carolina originally served the entire colony and met in Charles Town. It had the same justices as the Court of Common Pleas, and it dealt with criminal cases. Some records of the court date from 1671. An act in 1785 established courts in every county. The current South Carolina Circuit Court has two divisions ‚Äì the civil division, called the Court of Common Pleas, and the criminal division, called the Court of General Sessions. Washington, D.C. The District of Columbia has a court called the Court of General Sessions. It is part of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia. However, it dates only as far back as 1963, when Congress converted the Municipal Court to the Court of General Sessions. It was combined with other courts into the Superior Court in 1970.

Its first play was a production of Richard III but harassment from the local officials of Madison caused the production to be moved to three different venues before closing. In 1970 at the invitation of Paul Sills, Organic moved to Chicago where Sills helped the theater find a home in the Holy Covenant Church where they produced original adaptations of George Orwell's Animal Farm and Homer's Odyssey. When Sills took his production of Story Theater to Los Angeles that summer he invited Organic to produce at his Body Politic Theater on Lincoln Avenue. The company ended up staying there over three years where it produced Candide which was invited by Joseph Papp to the Public Theater in New York. They also produced Poe by playwright Stephen Most and Warp! by Stuart Gordon and Bury St. Edmund aka Lenny Kleinfeld, an original science-fiction epic adventure in three parts. Warp! was produced on Broadway at the Ambassador Theater in 1973. Returning to Chicago the company set up shop in the Uptown Center Hull House on Beacon Street. The new company included Joe Mantegna, Dennis Franz and Meshach Taylor. Their first production there was The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit by Ray Bradbury. This was followed by Bloody Bess - A Tale of Piracy and Revenge by John Ostrander and William J. Norris. In 1974 they presented the world premiere of Sexual Perversity in Chicago by David Mamet. That same year they embarked on their first European tour playing in Amsterdam, Brussels, and Hamburg. Returning to Chicago they produced a two part adaptation of Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn. This production toured the United States and Europe. In the next few years Organic worked with Roald Dahl to present Switch Bitch and Kurt Vonnegut Jr.'s The Sirens of Titan In 1976 they created Bleacher Bums and toured the show throughout the United States and presented the show at The American Place Theater. It was adapted for television and aired nationally on PBS in 1979. In 1985, with Stuart Gordon directing, Organic Theatre,in collaboration with Goodman Theatre staged a shortened version of its earlier two-evening Huckleberry Finn in Chicago. The production was also recorded on stage for a WTTW-TV special. The cast included a young Hedwig's Angry Inch creator John Cameron Mitchell as Huck, Tom Towles as Pap, Meshach Taylor as Jim, Eric Berg as Tom Sawyer, and an ensemble consisting of Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, Roberta Custer, Peter Van Wagner, Michael Fosberg, and Richard Henzel. In 1981 Organic renovated the Buckingham Theater on Clark Street where it worked with author Mary Renault to adapt her book The King Must Die to the stage. This was followed by a musical adaptation of William Kotzwinkle's book Dr. Rat by June Shellene and Richard Fire and the company's longest running show E/R conceived by Dr. Ronald Berman. Productions Notable productions during founding artistic director Stuart Gordon's leadership included: * Sexual Perversity in Chicago by David Mamet, world premiere production * Cops by Terry Curtis Fox, starring Dennis Franz and Joe Mantegna * Bleacher Bums concept by Joe Mantegna, (there was also production for WTTW television that aired in 1979) * E/R Emergency Room by Zaid Farid, Richard Fire, Stuart Gordon, Gary Houston, Carolyn Purdy-Gordon, Tom Towles, Bruce A. Young and Dr. Ronald Berman, who suggested the concept of the play. It later became a television series E/R in 1984, with Bruce A. Young and Shuko Akune reprising their roles from the Organic production. * The Sirens of Titan (1977) adapted by Stuart Gordon from the 1959 novel by Kurt Vonnegut After ‚ÄúE/R Emergency Room,‚Äù Stuart Gordon went to the west coast to make his cult classic sci-fi film \\"Re-Animator\\". Artistic directors after Stuart Gordon included Thomas Ricciohttp://www.thomas-riccio.net and Richard Fire.

Historically it was called Ninch,Placenames Database of Ireland: Laytown (see archival records) after the townland it occupies.Placenames Database of Ireland: Ninch Together with the neighbouring villages of Mornington and Bettystown it comprises the census town of Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington with a combined population of 10,889 at the 2011 Census, which is part of the wider area collectively known as East Meath. The 2016 Census recorded a population of 11,872 in the area which is now called Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington- Donacarney. Beachfront sculpture Voyager History The surrounding area is known to have been settled for around 1500 years; recent excavations have revealed settlement at Laytown since at least the 6th century AD. =Archaeological finds= One of the most notable historical finds in Irish history was made on Bettystown beach in 1850. A local woman claimed (rather implausibly) to have found the Tara Brooch in a box buried in the sand. Many think it was in fact found inland and the claim was made to avoid a legal claim by the landowner of the actual find site, wherever that was. The Tara Brooch is now on display in the National Museum of Ireland in Dublin. More recent archaeological finds include, for example, a blue glass bead of the Early Christian Period which was found in 1976 at the rath at Ninch West. The rath is traditionally associated with Laeg mac Riangabra, Cuchulain's charioteer, from whom Laytown is said to take its name. The glass bead is now also in the collection of the National Museum of Ireland. Also in the late 1970s, an earthen mound known locally as 'The Mote' and overlooking the River Nanny at The Ninch, was partially excavated by P. D. Sweetman for the National Monuments Section of the Office of Public Works. Two Iron Age interments were found.http://www.themodernantiquarian.com/site/925/laytown_an_inse.htmlSweetman, P.D. 1982-3 ‚ÄòReconstruction and partial Excavation of an Iron Age Burial Mound at Ninch, Co.

With the ever-developing and growing city of Dublin, Laytown, along with other villages and towns all along the east coast, has seen population growth. This has brought problems with overcrowded schools. https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/25/business/worldbusiness/25youth.html?ex=1327381200&en;=38409dcd59f12062&ei;=5088&partner;=rssnyt&emc;=rss Geography Laytown is 50 km (30 mi) north of the nation's capital, Dublin. Laytown and neighbouring village, Bettystown, sit on one of Ireland's most scenic beachfronts. The beach stretches from Mornington at the River Boyne, which borders County Louth to Gormanston at the River Delvin, which borders County Dublin. Laytown sits on the mouth of the River Nanny, a tidal estuary where mullet, trout, eels, gobies and flounder can be caught - but no salmon. According to local folklore, Saint Patrick banished all the salmon from the river. By an old schoolhouse overlooking the river there is a spring known as St Patrick's Well, though the access path to it is overgrown. = Climate = Laytown has a temperate oceanic climate (K√∂ppen: Cfb), similar to most other towns in Ireland, with few extremes of temperature and ample precipitation all year round and an annual average rainfall of . Weather in Laytown is very similar to that of nearby Drogheda. Education There are two primary schools in Laytown/Bettystown which follow a Catholic ethos. They are Scoil Oilibhear Naofa Junior School and Scoil an Spioraid Naomh Senior School. Scoil Oilibhear Naofa is a recently built state-of-the-art school and the Department of Education has plans for a complete redevelopment of Scoil an Spioraid Naomh.. There are also two multi-denominational schools outside the town that service East Meath and South Drogheda. They are Le Cheile Educate Together National School and Gaelscoil an Bhradain Feasa. These schools teach an ethical programme and a basic type of comparative religion. If parents want the children to have faith formation in any particular religion, they have to arrange that in after school classes. A new secondary school (Colaiste na hInse) has been built in Laytown which services the East Meath area. Transport and communications The village is a commuter town for people working in Dublin, who are served by the rail line into Dublin Connolly station, and the M1 motorway linking the north east of the country to the capital. The village is served by the Northern commuter train line linking Drogheda and Dundalk to Connolly station in Dublin. Laytown railway station opened on 25 May 1844 and was renamed as Laytown & Bettystown in 1913. An express coach service links Laytown, Bettystown and Sonairte with Parnell Street in Dublin. Bus √âireann has changed from route 190 to the D1 which provides several daily services to/from Drogheda via Bettystown and Mornington. A Great Northern Railway (Ireland) locomotive Slieve Gullion in May 1985 going through Laytown railway station on a special run by the Railway Preservation Society of Ireland. The East Meath area also has a free monthly magazine known as the Meath Coaster. This magazine, solely supplied in East Meath, showcases images of the coast's scenery, local schools' and clubs' achievements as well as an update from the Meath County Council. Amenities The town has a garda station and a primary school called Scoil an Spioraid Naoimh. Col√°iste na hInse is a co-educational secondary school in Laytown which was founded in 2008 and had an enrollment of over 1,000 pupils as of 2018. The village also has three pubs, two newsagents, a pharmacy, two take- aways and a railway station. Sonairte, the National Ecology Centre, is half a mile from the station on the Julianstown road (R150). https://web.archive.org/web/20080517124617/http://www.sonairte.org/ Laytown on film Both Irish and American movies (The Crying Game and Michael Collins) and television shows have been filmed all over Laytown, mostly on the beach. The Crying Game was filmed locally in the village of Laytown in 1991 using the carpark as a fair-ground and the former long wooden pedestrian bridge over the River Nanny as a location. Laytown races Since 1868 Laytown has hosted a single annual horse racing meeting on its beach - one of only a couple on sand (held on the beach) race meetings run under official rules of racing in Europe. The BBC have made it the subject of a documentary, titled Racing the Tide, and have included passages in their Coast and Countryfile programmes. The horses used to run along the beach, make a U-turn and run back. The onlookers used to stand just feet away from them to watch the racing, with no barriers in between. In 1994 a terrible accident occurred when one of the horses became spooked by a small river stream on the course and bolted into the crowd. This caused panic amongst some of the other horses too. One jockey was taken to hospital, several people in the crowd were injured, and, tragically, three horses had to be put down because of the injuries they sustained. The races were abandoned for a few years and when they did restart, several safety measures had been put into practice. Barriers were constructed, the crowd were separated from the runners and now watch from a field next to the beach, the number of runners in each race was limited and the races were limited to much shorter distances with no turning round. Politics The Laytown-Bettystown-Mornington-Julianstown area is governed locally by the Meath County Council. However, this area of east Meath is part of the Louth (D√°il constituency) constituency.

Conflict Archive on the Internet (CAIN). Retrieved 5 April 2011. ‚Äì 25 September 2011) was a leader of the paramilitary Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) and a leading loyalist politician in Northern Ireland. One of the first UVF members to be convicted of murder, Spence was a senior figure in the organisation for over a decade. During his time in prison Spence renounced violence and helped to convince a number of fellow inmates that the future of the UVF lay in a more political approach. Spence joined the Progressive Unionist Party (PUP), becoming a leading figure in the group. As a PUP representative he took a principal role in delivering the loyalist ceasefires of 1994. Early years Spence was born in the Shankill Road, Belfast, Northern Ireland, the son of William Edward Spence, who was born in Whitehaven, England and raised in the Tiger's Bay area of north Belfast before moving to the Shankill.Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 6 William Edward Spence was a member of the Ulster Volunteers and had fought in the First World War.Thomas Hennessey, Northern Ireland: The Origin of the Troubles, Dublin: Gill & Macmillan, 2005, p. 54 He married Isabella \\"Bella\\" Hayes, Gusty Spence's mother, in 1919. Spence was the sixth of seven children, their birth order being Billy, Cassie, Jim, Bobby, Ned junior, Gusty and Lily. The family home was 66 Joseph Street in an area of the lower Shankill known colloquially as \\"the Hammer\\".Roy Garland, Gusty Spence, Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2001, p. 5 He was educated at the Riddel School on Malvern Street and the Hemsworth Square school, both on the Shankill, finishing his education aged fourteen.Garland, Gusty Spence, pp. 11‚Äì12 He was also a member of the Church Lads' Brigade, a Church of Ireland group, and the Junior Orange Order.Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 12 His family had a long tradition of Orange Order membership.Steve Bruce, The Red Hand, Oxford University Press, 1992, p. 15 Spence took various manual jobs in the area until joining the British Army in 1957 as a member of the Royal Ulster Rifles. Spence rose to the rank of military police sergeant.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Dublin: Poolbeg, 1997, p. 20 He served in the army until 1961 when ill-health forced him to leave. Spence was stationed in Cyprus during his time in the army and saw action fighting against the forces of Colonel Georgios Grivas.Moloney, Paisley, p. 130 After leaving the army Spence found employment at the Harland & Wolff shipyard in Belfast where he worked as a stager (builder of the scaffolding in which the ships are constructed), a skilled job that commanded respect amongst working class Protestants and ensured for Spence a higher status within the Shankill. From an early age Spence was a member of the Prince Albert Temperance Loyal Orange Lodge, where fellow members included John McQuade.Moloney, Paisley, pp. 130‚Äì131 He was also a member of the Royal Black Institution and the Apprentice Boys of Derry.Susan McKay, Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People, Belfast: Blackstaff Press, 2005, p. 139 Due to his later involvement in a murder he was expelled from the Orange Order and the Royal Black Institution, although it is unknown whether the Apprentice Boys of Derry took any disciplinary action. The Reverend Martin Smyth was influential in the expulsion of Spence by the Orange Order.Brian Kennaway The Orange Order-A Tradition Betrayed, p. 47 Involvement with loyalism His older brother Billy Spence was a founding member of Ulster Protestant Action (UPA) in 1956Moloney, Paisley, pp. 74‚Äì75 and Gusty Spence himself was also a member of the group. He was frequently involved in street fights with republicans and garnered a reputation as a \\"hard man\\". He was also associated loosely with prominent loyalists such as Ian Paisley and Desmond Boal and was advised by both men in 1959 when he launched a protest against Gerry Fitt at Belfast City Hall after Fitt had described Spence's regiment as \\"murderers\\" over allegations that they had killed civilians in Cyprus. Spence, along with other Shankill Road loyalists, broke from Paisley in 1965 when they sided with Jim Kilfedder in a row that followed the latter's campaigns in Belfast West. Paisley had intimated that Kilfedder, a rival for the leadership of dissident unionism, was close to Fine Gael after learning that he had attended party meetings while a student at Trinity College, Dublin. The Shankill loyalists supported Kilfedder and following his election as MP sent a letter to Paisley accusing him of treachery during the entire affair.Moloney, Paisley, p. 133 Ulster Volunteer Force Spence had claimed that he was approached in 1965 by two men, one of whom was an Ulster Unionist Party MP, who told him that the Ulster Volunteer Force was to be re-established and that he was to have responsibility for the Shankill. He was sworn in soon afterwards in a ceremony held in secret near Pomeroy, County Tyrone.Hennessey, Northern Ireland, p. 55 Because of his military experience Gusty Spence was chosen as the military commander and public face of the UVF when the group was established although RUC Special Branch believed that his brother Billy, who kept a much lower public profile, was the real leader of the group. Whatever the truth of this intelligence, Gusty Spence's Shankill UVF team was made up of only around 12 men on its formation. Their base of operations was the Standard Bar, a pub on the Shankill Road frequented by Spence and his allies (it was normal practice for UVF \\"teams\\" to be based at a single pub that its members used socially). On 7 May 1966, a group of UVF men led by Spence petrol bombed a Catholic-owned pub on the Shankill Road. Fire also engulfed the house next door, killing the elderly Protestant widow, Matilda Gould (77), who lived there. On 27 May, Spence ordered four UVF men to kill an Irish Republican Army (IRA) member, Leo Martin, who lived on the Falls Road. Unable to find their target, the men drove around in search of any Catholic instead. They shot dead John Scullion (28), a Catholic civilian, as he walked home.Dillon, Martin. The Shankill butchers: the real story of cold-blooded mass murder. Routledge, 1999. Pages 20‚Äì23 Spence later wrote \\"at the time, the attitude was that if you couldn't get an IRA man you should shoot a Taig, he's your last resort\\". On 26 June, the same gang shot dead Catholic civilian Peter Ward (18) and wounded two others as they left a pub on Malvern Street, Belfast. Two days later, the government of Northern Ireland declared the UVF illegal. Shortly after, Spence and three others were arrested. In October 1966, Spence was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Peter Ward, although Spence has always claimed he was innocent. He was sent to Crumlin Road Prison. During its 12 July 1967 march, the Orange lodge to which he belonged stopped outside the prison in tribute to him.McKay, Susan. \\"Portadown: Bitter Harvest\\". Northern Protestants: An Unsettled People. Blackstaff Press, 2000. This occurred despite Spence having been officially expelled from the Orange Order following his conviction.Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 77 Spence's involvement in the killings gave him legendary status among many young loyalists and he was claimed as an inspiration by the likes of Michael Stone.Martin Dillon, Stone Cold, London: Arrow Books, 1993, pp. 23‚Äì24 Tim Pat Coogan has described Spence as a \\"loyalist folk hero\\".Tim Pat Coogan, The Troubles, London: Hutchinson, 1995, p. 380 The attack was however repudiated by Ian Paisley and condemned in his Protestant Telegraph, sealing the earlier split between the two.Peter Taylor, Loyalists, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2000, p. 43 In prison Spence appealed against his conviction and was the subject of a release petition organised by the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee, although nothing came of either initiative.Taylor, Loyalists, p. 44 Despite the fact that control of the UVF lay (nominally at least) with Spence's closest ally Samuel \\"Bo\\" McClelland, from prison Spence was often at odds with the group's leadership, in particular with regards to the 1971 McGurk's Bar bombing. Spence now argued that UVF members were soldiers and soldiers should not kill civilians, as had been the case at McGurk's Bar.Taylor, Loyalists, p. 109Cusack & McDonald, UVF, p. 21 Spence respected Irish republican paramilitaries, who he felt also lived as soldiers, and to this end he wrote a sympathetic letter to the widow of Official IRA leader Joe McCann after he was killed in 1972.Taylor, Loyalists, p. 109‚Äì110 Spence sent a sympathetic letter to Joe McCanns widow when he died because Spence was captured by Joe McCann while patrolling the Fall's Rd area. Joe McCann released Spence because McCann stated \\"Spence was just a soldier like him who believed in his cause.\\" =Fugitive= Spence was granted two days leave around 1 July 1972 to attend the wedding of his daughter Elizabeth to Winston Churchill \\"Winkie\\" Rea. The latter had formally asked Spence for his daughter's hand in marriage during a prison visit.Taylor. Loyalists. pp.110‚Äì111 Met by two members of the Red Hand Commando upon his release, Spence was informed of the need for a restructuring within the UVF, and told not to return to prison. He initially refused and went on to attend his daughter's wedding. Afterwards a plot was concocted where his nephew Frankie Curry, also a UVF member, would drive Spence back to jail but the car would be stopped and Spence \\"kidnapped\\". As arranged, the car in which Spence was a passenger was stopped on the Springmartin Road and Spence was taken away by UVF members. He remained at large for four months and during that time even gave an interview to ITV's World in Action in which he called for the UVF to take an increased role in the Northern Ireland conflict against the Provisional IRA while also distancing himself from any policy of random murders of Catholics.Taylor. Loyalists. pp. 111‚Äì112 He also took on responsibility for the restructuring, returning the UVF to the same command structure and organisational base that Edward Carson had utilised for the original UVF, with brigades, battalions, companies, platoons, and sections. He also directed a significant restocking of the group's arsenal, with guns mostly taken from the security forces.Taylor, Loyalists, p. 112 Spence gave his permission for UVF brigadier Billy Hanna to establish the UVF's Mid-Ulster Brigade in Lurgan, and endorsed Hanna as commander of the unit.\\"Sunningdale pushed hard-liners into fatal outrages in 1974\\".

He was returned to Crumlin Road gaol soon afterwards, where he shared a cell with William \\"Plum\\" Smith, one of the Red Hand Commandos whom he had met upon his initial release and who had since been jailed for attempted murder.Taylor, Loyalists, pp. 112‚Äì113 Move to politics Spence soon became the UVF commander within the Maze Prison. Spence ran his part of the Maze along military lines, drilling inmates and training them in weapons use while also expecting a maintenance of discipline.Dillon, Stone Cold, p. 39 As the loyalist Maze commander, Spence initially also had jurisdiction over the imprisoned members of the Ulster Defence Association (UDA), although this came to an end in 1973 when, following a deterioration of relations between the two groups outside the prison walls, James Craig became the UDA's Maze commander.Henry McDonald & Jim Cusack, UDA, Dublin: Penguin Ireland, 2004, p. 110 By this time Spence polarised opinion within the UVF, with some members fiercely loyal to a man they saw as a folk hero and others resenting his draconian leadership and increasing emphasis on politics, with one anonymous member even labelling him \\"a cunt in a cravat\\".Bruce, The Red Hand, p. 118 Spence began to move towards a position of using political means and persuaded the UVF leadership to declare a temporary ceasefire in 1973.Taylor, Loyalists, p. 138 Following Merlyn Rees' decision to legalise the UVF in 1974, Spence encouraged them to enter politics and supported the establishment of the Volunteer Political Party. However, Spence's ideas were abandoned as the UVF ceasefire fell apart that same year following the Ulster Workers' Council strike and the Dublin and Monaghan bombings; the carnage of the latter had shocked and horrified Spence.Taylor, Loyalists, p.139 Furthermore, the VPP suffered a heavy defeat in West Belfast in the October 1974 general election, when the DUP candidate John McQuade captured six times as many votes as the VPP's Ken Gibson.Taylor, pp. 139‚Äì140 Spence was increasingly disillusioned with the UVF and he imparted these views to fellow inmates at Long Kesh. According to Billy Mitchell, Spence quizzed him and others sent to the Maze about why they were there, seeking an ideological answer to his question. When the prisoner was unable to provide one Spence would then seek to convince them of the wisdom of his more politicised path, something that he accomplished with Mitchell.McKay, Northern Protestants, p. 55 David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson were among the other UVF men imprisoned in the mid-1970s to become disciples of Spence.Taylor, Loyalists, pp. 141‚Äì142 In 1977 he publicly condemned the use of violence for political gain, on the grounds that it was counter-productive. In 1978 Spence left the UVF altogether. His brother Bobby, also a UVF member, died in October 1980 inside the Maze, a few months after the death of their brother Billy.Garland, Roy. Gusty Spence. p. 242 PUP activity Released from prison in 1984, he soon became a leading member of the UVF-linked Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) and a central figure in the Northern Ireland peace process. Spence initially worked solely for the PUP but after a spell he also set up the Shankill Activity Centre, a government-supported scheme to provide training and leisure opportunities for unemployed youths.Bruce, The Red Hand, p. 147 He was entrusted by the Combined Loyalist Military Command (CLMC) to read out their 13 October 1994 statement that announced the loyalist ceasefire. Flanked by his PUP colleagues Jim McDonald and William \\"Plum\\" Smith, as well as Ulster Democratic Party members Gary McMichael, John White and Davy Adams, Spence read out the statement from Fernhill a former Cunningham family home on their former Glencairn estate in Belfast's Glencairn area, an important training centre for members of Edward Carson's original UVF.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 274‚Äì275 A few days after the announcement, Spence made a trip to the United States along with the PUP's David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson and the UDP's McMichael, Adams and Joe English, where among their engagements was one as guests of honour of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 275 He went on to become a leading advocate of the Belfast Agreement. In August 2000, Spence was caught up in moves by Johnny Adair's \\"C\\" Company of the UDA to take control of the Shankill by forcing out the UVF and other opponents. Adair's men forced their way into Spence's Shankill home but found it empty as Spence tended to spend much of the summer at a caravan he owned in Groomsport. Nonetheless the C Company members ransacked the house and stole Spence's army medals while the Spence family were forced to stay off the Shankill for the entirety of the loyalist feud.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, pp. 326‚Äì327 When Spence's wife died three years later he said that C Company had been responsible for her death such was the toll that the events had taken on her health.McDonald & Cusack, UDA, p. 327 On 3 May 2007, he read out the statement by the UVF announcing that it will keep its weapons but put them beyond the reach of ordinary members. The statement also included a warning that activities could \\"provoke another generation of loyalists toward armed resistance\\". He did not specify what activities or what was being resisted. Personal life Spence married Louie Donaldson, a native of the city's Grosvenor Road, on 20 June 1953 at Wellwood Street Mission, Sandy Row.Garland, R. Gusty Spence, p. 28 The couple had three daughters, Elizabeth (born 1954), Sandra (1956) and Catherine (1960).Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 29 Louie died in 2003. Spence, a talented footballer in his youth with Old Lodge F.C., was a lifelong supporter of Linfield F.C.Garland, Gusty Spence, p. 14 =Death= Spence died on 25 September 2011, aged 78, in a Belfast hospital; he had been suffering from a long-term illness and was admitted to hospital 12 days prior to his death. Spence was praised by, among others, PUP leader Brian Ervine, who stated that \\"his contribution to the peace is incalculable\\"; and Sinn F√©in's Gerry Kelly who claimed that while Spence had been central to the development of loyalist paramilitarism, \\"he will also be remembered as a major influence in drawing loyalism away from sectarian strife\\". However, a granddaughter of Matilda Gould, who died of burn injuries at the age of 74, which had been sustained in the UVF's attempted bombing of a Catholic bar next door to Gould's home, objected to Spence being called a \\"peacemaker\\" and described him as a \\"bad evil man\\".

As of 2006, its circulation was quoted at 11,000. The news is currently available on-line, as well as via the traditional broadsheet format, providing options for readers. The publication was known as The Daily Inter-Mountain in the early part of the twentieth century, The paper was later called The Elkins Inter-Mountain for many years and now for several decades the newspaper has been titled The Inter-Mountain, reflecting the broad range of circulation to many cities, towns, and rural areas of West Virginia. General Information The Inter-Mountain has served the citizenry of central West Virginia for more than a century. In fact, for years The Inter-Mountain has been the only daily newspaper in Randolph and the 7 surrounding counties. The newspaper's production center is located in a college town, home of Davis & Elkins College, and is near land transportation links and an airport. A nationally recognized fall festival is held early in October known as the Mountain State Forest Festival. The festival provides opportunity to celebrate the beauty of the forests and brings thousands of visitors to the city each year. Dignitaries have descended upon Elkins for each of the many fall celebrations. Historical Information The Elkins- based newspaper of the Ogden Newspapers Inc. chain has an interesting history. In 1897, a fire in the town did much damage to the early newspaper offices and other structures. Again, on August 7, 1974, The Inter-Mountain burned to the ground and everything was destroyed but a camera, a roll of film, and the newspaper personnel who escaped with their lives literally running from the fire. Stories of the fire and the response to the emergency were highlighted in news stories published around the country. A story in The Miami Herald noted that Editor Eldora Marie Bolyard Nuzum vowed that not one edition would be missed as a result of the fire.Newspaper Building Destroyed-Editor Laments $500,000 Loss\\", The Miami Herald, Miami, Florida, August 8, 1974, 8-B. Other publications and the broadcast media carried the story of the newspaper that had not died in the fire and the famous radio commentator, Paul Harvey, praised the Editor, staff, and publisher for perseverance against the odds in one of his \\"now you know the rest of the story seqments\\". By borrowing typewriters, getting a press delivered into Elkins meant for another town, and printing the paper at another Ogden site in Parkersburg, the next scheduled edition of The Inter-Mountain was delivered carrying the story of the fire on the first page. Not one employee lost their job. In The 100 Best Small Towns in America by Norman Crampton, printed in 1995, Eldora Nuzum was quoted, \\"We made headlines across the country\\" and she suggested \\"the show must go on.\\" Crampton wrote that \\"She asked townspeople who had darkrooms to go straight home and develop the film that many had shot of the big blaze downtown. Mrs. Nuzum even had the presence of mind to remember regular events--she assigned a reporter to cover the school board meeting that evening.\\" Crampton, Norman. The 100 Best Small Towns in America. 2nd edition. MacMillan, New York, 1995, pp. 134-37. Over the years, The Inter-Mountain Editor, Eldora Nuzum, interviewed U.S. Presidents and other dignitaries and is recognized as a respected and honored American newspaper editor and American journalist.Skidmore, Linda H. and Higgins, Carra, \\"Press Association Honors Nuzum\\", The Inter-Mountain, Elkins, West Virginia, August 8, 2009, 1,7A. She was the first female editor of a daily newspaper in West Virginia.Sullivan, Ken (ed). The West Virginia Encyclopedia, WV Humanities Council, Charleston, WV, 2006. 539. Though women before her published small, sporadic social publications, Nuzum was a pioneer in being managing editor of a daily periodical publishing hard news in the state. The Inter-Mountain developed from a linotype print publication to the modern, computerized publication it is today. Owner Information The Inter-Mountain is one of several newspapers printed by Ogden Newspapers Inc. in West Virginia and is among many papers published by the major chain in the United States. Publishing Information The Inter-Mountain recently named a new publisher, Heather Goodwin Henline, who has been with Ogden Newspapers Inc. for 13 years.Goodwin Henline named publisher She has won multiple state and national newspaper awards and recognitions during her tenure. The West Virginia native most recently was editor of The Journal in Martinsburg, W.Va., one of The Inter- Mountains sister publications.

It is a sequel for Synergistic's 1990 title Spirit of Excalibur, set in Spain around the turn of the 10th and 11th Centuries. Vengeance of Excalibur puts the player in control of a small team of \\"Knights of the Round Table\\" who will seek out in Spain for the stolen items of the treasure of Camelot (the series advances the timeline of Arthurian lore 500 years past period where it is usually established). Plot The game begins two years after Spirit of Excalibur left off: Britain has been reunited under King Constantine III, who succeeds King Arthur after the Battle of Camlann, and peacefully rules over the realm after killing Mordred's sons and their aunt, Morgan le Fay. During a stormy night a lone knight is admitted into Camelot; while Constantine converses with the stranger, the knight lets in a second figure, who subsequently transforms Constantine into a statue. They then proceed to the treasure room of the castle and steal its contents, including Arthur's mythical sword Excalibur and the recently recovered Holy Grail. The knight is also able to subdue and kidnap Nineve, the court's sorceress, second in magical power only to Merlin. With the treasures of Camelot stolen, plagues and demonic creatures roam the British country-side. Merlin is appointed acting regent of the realm while the Knights of the Round Table are dispatched in small groups to search the medieval western Europe and find a way to stop this mystic assault. The player controls a group of knights bound for the Iberian peninsula from Portsmouth: a witness to the assault on Camelot reveals that the knight is the rogue warrior Sir Bruce sans Pitie, and that there is evidence that indicates that he may have traveled to Spain, a country torn by the war between the Christian kingdoms of the north and the Muslim caliphates of the south, and plagued by groups of mercenary knights, violent bandits, and clannish Basques. If they manage to negotiate these hazards, the forces of the Round Table must still find and defeat Sir Bruce and his ally, the Shadow Master. Gameplay Screenshot of a \\"scene level\\" from Vengeance of Excalibur Episode 1 Gameplay in Vengeance of Excalibur is nearly identical to its predecessor Spirit of Excalibur: the game is made up of seven episodes, each with a specific goal, usually the retrieval of one of the stolen artifacts, and a number of lesser quests that may be undertaken to complete the episode, or to enhance the powers of the player's knights. Unlike Spirit where the player had many knights under his control, in Vengeance of Excalibur he or she only has a team of four knights which are later joined by the sorceress Nineve and by other characters who temporarily join the player's team ‚Äì usually to provide troops for large-scale battles. Some of the knights the player can choose from at the beginning are either returning characters from Spirit, like Sir Lancelot or Sir Bors, while the others are new and not necessarily derived from Arthurian mythology. Every character has his strong point when the game begins; for example Lancelot is the most combat-capable starting out, while Bors is the most pious. The player is also presented with the chance to import four characters from Spirit of Excalibur, bringing the total number of knights that can be chosen up to sixteen. These imported characters (which can include Lancelot and Bors) are translated into the game with most of their statistics and items intact from Spirit, which can make the game easier if they were significantly developed in the previous game. Vengeance of Excalibur has some important differences that set it apart from that of its predecessor. The first difference relates to individual combat, which now allows for 3-versus-3 fights, as opposed to the 1-vs.-1 battles of the original game. In addition, the player can no longer manually control his fighter: there are now however three different combat styles that the player can choose for every character who is fighting (reckless/full offense, normal, and cautious/full defense). The second difference is the size of the locations the player can travel to. In Spirit of Excalibur every location usually had a few scenes, like the outside and the inside of a castle, from which the characters could move to and from. In Vengeance locations often have more than two scenes, and the characters can be directed to more than one direction in each scene. This effectively creates a larger environment for the player to explore, and it makes in-game mazes and labyrinths possible. Reception Computer Gaming World stated that Vengeances story was inferior to its predecessor and the final battle was disappointing, but liked the audio.

The remains of the gardens are Grade II* listed with the adjoining Chart Park on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens. History of the estate A hillside manor that descended from earlier Earls of Surrey throughout the Middle Ages to the 23rd Earl of Arundel and Surrey who became the 5th Duke of Norfolk in 1652, it was sold by his descendant the 11th Duke of Norfolk in 1807 to the Hope banking family. Its descent was not straightforward; the family successfully put forward an acceptable stance and level of regal support in the Wars of the Roses, English Reformation and Marian Persecutions, the English Civil War and avoided the ravages of Popish Plot Anti-Catholicism which plagued five years of the reign of Charles II of England such as resulted in the execution of close kinsman William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford. The Duke of Norfolk of this family is today one of two people to be guaranteed a seat in the House of Lords, whose family arms appears in the chamber and who has mostly ceremonial roles he is expected to perform, rather than to speak in debates. At the height of the regency architecture period the house was remodelled by the architect, William Atkinson for banker and celebrated interior designer Thomas Hope, work that completed in 1823; he also developed the grounds in a particular picturesque style. The house was occupied by his son, the MP Henry Hope from c. 1840. Between 1836 and 1841 the house was again remodelled, by the architect Alexander Roos, in the form of a great Roman villa. Latter occupants and demolition It was let, for a while to Lord William Beresford VC and his wife Lilian, formerly Duchess of Marlborough. Deepdene was placed into receivership and sold in 1917. It became a hotel during the inter-war years. During the Second World War it became the home of various offices of the Southern Railway Company mainly the Chief Accounts office which was 'temporarily' evacuated there from London. Deepdene House was demolished by British Rail in 1967, and in 1969 replaced by an office block designed by architects Scherrer & Hicks. The site has since been redeveloped as a green office estate, and partly sold for private development. Pevsner summed up the demise of Hope's masterpiece as a \\"disgraceful and depressing story\\". Remnant gardens and Dorking Golf Course Deepdene Gardens The gardens were laid out by Thomas Howard, 5th Duke of Norfolk. The horticulturalist and planner John Claudius Loudon praised the gardens as an exemplar of landscape architecture, one of the earliest uses of that phrase. A large minority of the gardens remain, which have been retained as features visible from the clubhouse to complement the holes and rough of Dorking Golf Course. Parts of the garden have been sold for residential homes and gardens. A project has recently restored and re-linked remaining parts of the garden and opened the Deepdene Trail to the public. The Deepdene Painter Thomas Hope (1769-1831), who lived in the house in the 1820s, was a major collector of, among other things, Ancient Greek pottery. Sir John Beazley, who classified Attic black-figure pottery and red-figure pottery, named an otherwise anonymous painter the \\"Deepdene Painter\\" after an amphora that was in the collection of Deepdene House. This name-vase passed from the Hope Collection at Deepdene to the Honorable Marshall Brooks at Tarporley and thence to William Randolph Hearst, who donated the amphora to the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, where it has the accession number 50.8.21. left References External links * *The Deepdene Trail Category:British country houses destroyed in the 20th century Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1967 Category:Country houses in Surrey Category:Gardens in Surrey Category:Grade II* listed parks and gardens in Surrey Category:Dorking ","title":"Deepdene House and Gardens"},{"id":"3637251","text":"Janey King (born 1947 in Denbigh, Wales) is a British journalist and romance novelist, writing under the pseudonym of Rosie Thomas.

The Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) was established by the United States Shipping Board, sometimes referred to as the War Shipping Board, on 16 April 1917 pursuant to the Shipping Act (39 Stat. 729) to acquire, maintain, and operate merchant ships to meet national defense, foreign and domestic commerce during World War I. The EFC was renamed the U.S. Shipping Board Merchant Fleet Corporation by act of Congress 11 February 1927 (44 Stat. 1083). The Board and Corporation were abolished 26 October 1936 and their functions transferred to the U.S. Maritime Commission by the Merchant Marine Act (49 Stat. 1985) of 29 June 1936. The Shipping Board had been established while the United States was at peace with intent to restore the nation's Merchant Marine. That changed with war. In the words of Edward N. Hurley, Chairman of the Board: > When the United States declared war against Germany the whole purpose and > policy of the Shipping Board and the Fleet Corporation suffered a radical > change overnight. From a body established to restore the American Merchant > Marine to its old glory, the Shipping Board was transformed into a military > agency to bridge the ocean with ships and to maintain the line of > communication between America and Europe. Conceived as an instrumentality of > peace, the Board became an instrumentality of war. Unlike other military > agencies‚Äîthe Army and Navy‚Äîit began with nothing‚Äîno ships, no officers, no > crews, no organizations. Ten days after the declaration of war the Emergency Fleet Corporation was established in response to those wartime requirements. Origin On 2 April 1917 President Woodrow Wilson cited Germany's refusal to suspend unrestricted submarine warfare in the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean in his request for a declaration of war on Germany, and Congress concurred on 2 April 1917. In that April 1,250,000 deadweight tons were sunk, with 122 ocean-going ships sunk in the first two weeks after that declaration of war. British losses in that period equaled an average round-trip voyage loss of 25%. Allied losses before U.S. entry had already been that heavy that construction in yards outside the U.S. was unable to sustain current losses. Congress had rejected previous attempts to create a shipping board to manage U.S. maritime affairs, beginning with bills introduced as early in the war as 4 September 1914. President Wilson repeatedly requested enactment of a shipping act until Representative Joshua W. Alexander introduced House Bill 15455 that became law as the Shipping Act of 1916 (39 Stat. L. 728). That act established the United States Shipping Board headed by five commissioners appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate. That board had complete control over American ships and shipping. Most importantly with respect to the Emergency Fleet Corporation was its power to form corporations for acquiring, maintaining and operating merchant vessels under certain conditions. Ten days after declaration of war, on 16 April 1917, the Board created the Emergency Fleet Corporation (EFC) in the District of Columbia with a capital stock of $50,000,000. Implementation The Shipping Act was a peacetime act not fully anticipating wartime conditions. On 11 July 1917 the President by Executive Order delegated to the EFC all his wartime power and authority to acquire existing vessels and to construct and operate all vessels acquired or to be acquired by the United States. The EFC operated largely under these powers rather than the basic peacetime act for the duration of the war. While the Act had envisioned the corporations with the United States as simply the majority stockholder, the wartime reality was that it was the sole stockholder. Legally the EFC could not actually operate the ships unless no private companies could be found to do so. In reality wartime conditions made tighter government control imperative. As a corporation, even with total government ownership, the EFC did not have the powers of the Board, thus the Shipping Board usually assumed and then transferred ships and facilities to the EFC which was subject to federal and state laws governing corporations. =Early controversy= A fundamental flaw led to early controversy. The Chairman of the United States Shipping Board, William Denman (a lawyer and campaign contributor to Woodrow Wilson), was also head of the EFC with only nominal powers over the EFC with the critical exception of the power to sign contracts. The EFC General Manager, General George Washington Goethals, had all other effective powers without that one crucial power necessary to implement the Corporation's policies.Richard Striner (2014). Woodrow Wilson and World War I: A Burden Too Great to Bear. Rowman&Littlefield.; p. 125. Popular conception of what became the Denman-Goethals controversy involved William Denman's support of wooden ship construction and General Goethals' opposition. That Goethals could not sign contracts while expected to build ships and Denman as President of the Fleet Corporation who could sign contracts had no control over the actual operation of the EFC resulted in the highly public resignation of both men. After the war, the wooden ship program in particular resulted in a large number of hulls with no useful purpose that were then a disposal problem. In retrospect some considered this entire effort a waste. The impractical plan to mass-produce a thousand small wooden steamers was developed by the lawyer William Denman and an amateur yachtsman from Massachusetts (Frederic A. Eustis). Both men convinced Woodrow Wilson of this scheme, and claimed the famous engineer General George Washington Goethals agreed to assist them, the White House announced to the press that Goethals would take the job (without his knowledge). Goethals reluctantly agreed ‚Äîbecause his quick resignation would lead to a public relations disaster for the president‚Äî, but he soon realized that the plan for building wooden ships was flawed (they were small, slow and could not efficiently be mass-produced). Goethals encouraged ship builders to look into the mass production of steel vessels by fabricating standardized parts across the country, a plan that would eventually be adopted.Anne Cipriano Venzon (2013). The United States in the First World War: An Encyclopedia. Routledge. p.550. =Reconstitution of the Board= \\"Make Every Minute Count For Pershing\\", United States Shipping Board Emergency Fleet Corporation, ca. 1917‚Äì1919 The President accepted the resignations of both Denman and Goethals and appointed Edward N. Hurley Chairman of the Shipping Board 27 July 1917. Rear Admiral Washington L. Capps replaced Goethals as General Manager of the EFC. Capps resigned due to ill health and was succeeded for two weeks by Rear-Admiral Frederic R. Harris who resigned over an issue of authority. EFC's Vice-President, Charles Piez then established stability by recommending that the General Manager post be abolished and that Charles M. Schwab be appointed in the new post of Director General. Schwab was thus able to give total attention to EFC matters, whereas Piez had held both posts of Vice-President and General Manager. Actions On entry into the war there were fewer than 50,000 shipyard workers in U.S. yards and production could not possibly meet wartime demands and attrition. Under the delegated Presidential authority the Shipping Board, through Admiral Capps, General Manager of the Fleet Corporation, requisitioned the shipyards and all steel ships over 2500 deadweight tons then under construction. A primary goal was to focus shipyard work on U.S. requirements rather than commercial needs of neutral and even Allied customers. Another goal was to standardize production. The shipyards protested without success. As many of the 431 ships involved were only contracts or still under construction the EFC assumed responsibility for their completion. There were international consequences, one being the fact that Great Britain had a large number of those ships also planned for war service. In the end the ships were requisitioned and the British were satisfied that they would be used in the war effort. Ships of enemy states interned in the U.S. were seized and some overseas were acquired. U.S. ships in service were then commandeered with their owners becoming operators for the EFC. Even Great Lakes shipping was pressed into oceanic service. With available ships and yards commandeered the EFC began its expansion of shipbuilding capacity. The early concept of managing the building of ships in existing yards was quickly shown to be inadequate as they were completing the hulls commandeered as contracted or in progress or with Navy orders. Entirely new shipyards had to be established with the EFC as sponsor. Four government-financed yards accounted for 25% of the new steel fabricated ships built with 94 ways. *Bristol yard: Merchant Shipbuilding CorporationSee Shipbuilding History, Merchant Shipbuilding Corp., Chester PA *Hog Island: American International Shipbuilding Corporation. Now the site of Philadelphia International Airport and the home of the notable \\"Hog Islander\\" ships. The Hog Island project was subject of some controversy but ended up being a prototype for mass-produced ships that was capable of handling up to 78 ships at a time on the ways or fitting out. *Newark: Submarine Boat Corporation *Wilmington-Carolina Shipbuilding Company: This was a minor yard in World War I and apparently not directly the predecessor of the North Carolina Shipbuilding Company prominent in World War II. In testimony Mr. Piez noted: \\"The Carolina Shipbuilding Company is constructing a yard with four ways at Wilmington, N.C. Our agents there are the Carolina Shipbuilding Company, which in reality is the Fuller Construction Company of New York, who are large builders.\\" In full operation these yards had more annual tonnage capacity than found in any country before 1918. Western World in 1922 The shipbuilding program was concluded with the 9 May 1922 delivery of the ship completed and delivered as Western World, launched as Nutmeg State 17 September 1921, by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation at Sparrows Point, Maryland. Ships built under the EFC were common in commerce after the war even while many were laid up. Twenty years later in the crisis of shipping before the U.S. began wartime production, to some extent using the USSB/EFC model again, the British need for hulls brought many of the old laid up ships now under Maritime Commission control into that war. Controversies Emergency Fleet Corporation Design 1001, Ferris type, photo of the USS Banago (ID # 3810). Incomplete merchant ships laid up at Seattle, Washington, circa early to mid-1919, probably the storage facility at Seattle used by the Northern Pacific Division of the Emergency Fleet Corporation for wooden cargo ships it accepted without engines after the World War I Armistice. Naval History & Heritage Command, Online Library of Selected Images, Photo #: NH 43179. The EFC was a subject of controversy. The armistice took effect before the yards, Hog Island being by far the largest and most publicized, reached full production and the expense was very large. The wooden ship program in particular resulted in a large number of hulls with no useful purpose that were then a disposal problem. Gearing up for wartime production produced a glut of ships and a market problem with peace. In retrospect some considered the entire effort waste. There were allegations of fraud, with one involving charges and civil suits against Charles W. Morse. The USSB and EFC are used by both those of the opinion government is too close to industry in collaboration for war projects and those with the view government should stay out of such matters and a source of waste even in national emergency. =Controversial wooden ships= A notable, possibly notorious, project was the wooden, ocean-going steamer. William Denman had been an early proponent of these ships, as the nation had abundant lumber supplies, and there was doubt whether domestic steel production could cope with the demands of shipbuilding in conjunction with other wartime pressures. Both British and U.S. officials considered the ships worthwhile if the ships could make a single, successful one-way voyage to the war. Still, the wooden ship program was so controversial that Edward N. Hurley, Chairman United States Shipping Board, had to defend them from \\"criticism and ridicule\\" with \\"I am convinced that we were amply justified in building the wood ships, although no one wished to assume the responsibility for them because of the criticism and ridicule which they had received.\\" Some of the several designs are commonly named Ferris Designs after Theodore E. Ferris, the official naval architect for the USSB. Ferris designed both steel and wood ships for mass production. One design, 1001, was for wooden 3,500 ton steam freighters with dimensions of approximately 281 X 46 X built largely of precut, numbered components of pine or Douglas fir. There were other wooden ship designs, many unique to regional yards, and a large wooden fleet was built, one that has been called by some the \\"white elephant\\" fleet. Some were burned in accidents; however others were burned after the war to recover valuable metals. For example, in 1922 Western Marine and Salvage Company (WM&SC;) of Alexandria, Virginia bought 233 such ships for $750,000 so that the ships could have machinery removed in Alexandria and then towed back to the anchorage on the Potomac and burned to regain remaining scrap. That activity brought protests from watermen and the operation was moved in 1924 to of company owned farmland surrounding Mallows Bay in Maryland.

An intercrosse stick is different from a normal lacrosse stick: the head is completely plastic while the head of a traditional stick has a pocket of synthetic mesh or leather and nylon string. The ball is larger, softer, and hollow, unlike a lacrosse ball, which is solid rubber. Intercrosse as a competitive adult sport is popular in many continental European countries, particularly in the Czech Republic, as well as in Quebec, Canada. Generally teams consist of five players per side, and the field size is 20 m wide and 40 m long. Goals are the same size as box lacrosse, 4 feet in height and width (1.2 x 1.2 m). As there is no contact allowed in the game, a player is not allowed to carry the ball for more than 5 seconds. Once it has obtained the ball a team must shoot on the goal within 30 seconds or lose possession. The international governing body is the F√©d√©ration Internationale d'Inter-Crosse (FIIC), it was formed in Paris in 1985. The FIIC hosts three international intercrosse competitions. The World Games was the first to be created in 1987. The World Games are an annual event where players from different countries come to compete and celebrate the sport of intercrosse. Players are divided randomly into mixed-gender teams to provide a focus on fair play and community. The World Championship started in 1999 and has been held bi- annually since 2006. The World Championship is for national teams and is meant to develop the sport at the elite level. Started in 2010, the European Cup is given to the club team earning the most points accumulated each year in approved tournaments across Europe. Soft stick lacrosse is also a popular way to introduce youth to lacrosse. It can be played outdoors or indoors and has a developed curriculum for physical education classes. Generally, the goals are small, semi-circular, portable nets and there is no goalie.

Personal life  Humphreys was born in Kingston-on-Thames, England, along with her brother Martin and sister Cathy. She now lives in Kingston, Ontario with her dog Charlotte. When she was younger she was expelled from high school and had to attend an alternative school to finish her education.Biography at Canadian Authors  Writing career  Humphreys's first novel, Leaving Earth, was a New York Times Notable Book in 1998, and a winner of the City of Toronto Book Award. In describing how she became a writer, Humphreys said, \\"I started writing when I was young and I just kept going. I read voraciously. I sent my poems (for I was writing exclusively poems then) out to magazines, and eventually I began to get them published. My first book of poetry came out when I was 25.\\" In a very favourable review of The Reinvention of Love in The Globe and Mail, Donna Bailey Nurse wrote: \\"The story is set amid the political turbulence and artistic fervour of 19th-century Paris. Charles Sainte-Beuve, an influential critic, earns the friendship of Victor Hugo after writing a review celebrating the writer's poems. He joins Hugo's literary circle, the Cenacle, which includes painter Delacroix, poet Lamartine and the boastful, profligate Alexandre Dumas. Charles becomes a fixture in the bustling Hugo household on Notre-Dame-des-Champs.\\" The Globe and Mail had this to say about Ms. Humphreys's recent novel: \\"The Evening Chorus, when all is said and done, is a formally conventional but for the most part satisfying yarn; a quiet novel about a calamitous event whose most trenchant passages show the cast of Humphreys's poet's eye.\\" Quill & Quire says of The River (2017): \\"Comparing The River to Helen Humphreys's critically acclaimed bestseller The Frozen Thames, her 2007 collection of vignettes about the eponymous river, it's obvious that the author is not content to repeat past successes.

The best-known captivity narratives in North America are those concerning Europeans and Americans taken as captives and held by the indigenous peoples of North America. These narratives have had an enduring place in literature, history, ethnography, and the study of Native peoples. They were preceded, among English-speaking peoples, by publication of captivity narratives related to English taken captive and held by Barbary pirates, or sold for ransom or slavery. Others were taken captive in the Middle East. These accounts established some of the major elements of the form, often putting it within a religious framework, and crediting God or Providence for gaining freedom or salvation. Following the North American experience, additional accounts were written after British people were captured during exploration and settlement in India and East Asia. Since the late 20th century, captivity narratives have also been studied as accounts of persons leaving, or held in contemporary religious cults or movements, thanks to scholars of religion like David G. Bromley and James R. Lewis. Traditionally, historians have made limited use of many captivity narratives. They regarded the genre with suspicion because of its ideological underpinnings. As a result of new scholarly approaches since the late 20th century, historians with a more certain grasp of Native American cultures are distinguishing between plausible statements of fact and value-laden judgments in order to study the narratives as rare sources from \\"inside\\" Native societies.Neal Salisbury. \\"Review of Colin Caolloway, 'North Country Captives: Selected Narratives of Indian Captivities'\\", American Indian Quarterly, 1994. vol. 18 (1). p. 97 In addition, modern historians such as Linda Colley and anthropologists such as Pauline Turner Strong have also found the North American narratives useful in analyzing how the colonists or settlers constructed the \\"other\\". They also assess these works for what the narratives reveal about the settlers' sense of themselves and their culture, and the experience of crossing the line to another. Colley has studied the long history of English captivity among other cultures, both the Barbary pirate captives who preceded those in North America, and British captives in cultures such as India or East Asia, which began after the early North American experience. Certain North American captivity narratives related to being held among Native peoples were published from the 18th through the 19th centuries. They reflected an already well-established genre in English literature, which some colonists would likely have been familiar with. There had already been numerous English accounts of captivity by Barbary pirates. Other types of captivity narratives, such as those recounted by apostates from religious movements (i.e. \\"cult survivor\\" tales), have remained an enduring topic in modern media. They have been published in books, and periodicals, in addition to being the subjects of film and television programs, both fiction and non- fiction.Joseph Laycock, \\"Where Do They Get These Ideas? Changing Ideas of Cults in the Mirror of Popular Culture\\", Journal of the American Academy of Religion, March 2013, Vol. 81, No. 1, pp. 80‚Äì106. Note: Laycock refers to an episode of the animated series King of the Hill, in which young women captured by a \\"cult\\" and subjected to a low-protein diet are rescued Texas-style: An open air beef barbecue is held outside the \\"cult\\" compound. When the women smell the steaks, and are fed bite-sized morsels, they are instantly rescued from their \\"brainwashed\\" state, and return to cultural normality. Laycock's work shows how anti-cult captivity narratives ‚Äì whether real or fictional, dramatic or comedic ‚Äì remain a staple of modern media. Background Elisa Bravo Jaramillo by Raymond Monvoisin Because of the competition between New France and New England in North America, raiding between the colonies was frequent. Colonists in New England were frequently taken captive by Canadiens and their Indian allies (similarly, the New Englanders and their Indian allies took Canadiens and Indian prisoners captive). According to Kathryn Derounian- Stodola, statistics on the number of captives taken from the 15th through the 19th centuries are imprecise and unreliable, since record-keeping was not consistent and the fate of hostages who disappeared or died was often not known.Introduction, Women's Indian Captivity Narratives, p. xv (New York: Penguin, 1998) Yet conservative estimates run into the thousands, and a more realistic figure may well be higher. Between King Philip's War (1675) and the last of the French and Indian Wars (1763), approximately 1,641 New Englanders were taken hostage.Vaughan, Alden T., and Daniel K. Richter. \\"Crossing the Cultural Divide:Indians and New Englanders, 1605‚Äì1763.\\" Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society 90 (1980): p. 53; 23‚Äì99. During the decades-long struggle between whites and Plains Indians in the mid-19th century, hundreds of women and children were captured.White, Lonnie J. \\"White Women Captives of Southern Plains Indians, 1866‚Äì1875\\", Journal of the West 8 (1969): 327‚Äì54 Many narratives included a theme of redemption by faith in the face of the threats and temptations of an alien way of life. Barbary captivity narratives, accounts of English people captured and held by Barbary pirates, were popular in England in the 16th and 17th centuries. The first Barbary captivity narrative by a resident of North America was that of Abraham Browne (1655). The most popular was that of Captain James Riley, entitled An Authentic Narrative of the Loss of the Brig Commerce (1817). Jonathan Dickinson's Journal, God's Protecting Providence ... (1699), is an account by a Quaker of shipwreck survivors captured by Indians in Florida. He says they survived by placing their trust in God to protect them. The Cambridge History of English and American Literature describes it as, \\"in many respects the best of all the captivity tracts.\\"The Cambridge History of English and American Literature. Volume XV. Colonial and Revolutionary Literature, Early National Literature, Part I, Travellers and Explorers, 1583‚Äì1763. 11. Jonathan Dickinson.] URL retrieved 24 March 2010 Ann Eliza Bleecker's epistolary novel, The History of Maria Kittle (1793), is considered the first known captivity novel. It set the form for subsequent Indian capture novels. Origins of narratives =New England and the Southern colonies= Hannah Duston by Junius Brutus Stearns American Indian captivity narratives, accounts of men and women of European descent who were captured by Native Americans, were popular in both America and Europe from the 17th century until the close of the United States frontier late in the 19th century. Mary Rowlandson's memoir, A Narrative of the Captivity and Restoration of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, (1682) is a classic example of the genre. According to Nancy Armstrong and Leonard Tennenhouse, Rowlandson's captivity narrative was \\"one of the most popular captivity narratives on both sides of the Atlantic.\\" Although the text temporarily fell out of print after 1720, it had a revival of interest in the 1780s. Other popular captivity narratives from the late 17th century include Cotton Mather's The Captivity of Hannah Dustin (1696‚Äì97), a well-known account that took place during King William's War, and Jonathan Dickinson's God's Protecting Providence (1699). American captivity narratives were usually based on true events, but they frequently contained fictional elements as well. Some were entirely fictional, created because the stories were popular. One spurious captivity narrative was The Remarkable Adventures of Jackson Johonnet, of Massachusetts (Boston, 1793). Captivity in another culture brought into question many aspects of the captives' lives. Reflecting their religious beliefs, the Puritans tended to write narratives that negatively characterized Indians. They portrayed the trial of events as a warning from God concerning the state of the Puritans' souls, and concluded that God was the only hope for redemption. Such a religious cast had also been part of the framework of earlier English accounts of captivity by Barbary pirates. The conflict between the English colonists and the French and Indians led to the emphasis of Indians' cruelty in English captivity narratives, to inspire hatred for their enemies. In William Flemming's Narrative of the Sufferings (1750), Indian barbarities are blamed on the teachings of Roman Catholic priests. During Queen Anne's War, French and Abenaki warriors made the Raid on Deerfield in 1704, killing many settlers and taking more than 100 persons captive. They were taken on a several hundred-mile overland trek to Montreal. Many were held there in Canada for an extended period, with some captives adopted by First Nations families and others held for ransom. In the colonies, ransoms were raised by families or communities; there was no higher government program to do so. The minister John Williams was among those captured and ransomed. His account, The Redeemed Captive (1707), was widely distributed in the 18th and 19th centuries, and continues to be published today. Due to his account, as well as the high number of captives, this raid, unlike others of the time, was remembered and became an element in the American frontier story.Haefeli and Sweeney, p. 273 During Father Rale's War, Indians raided Dover, New Hampshire. Elizabeth Hanson wrote a captivity narrative after gaining return to her people. Susannah Willard Johnson of New Hampshire wrote about her captivity during the French and Indian War (the North American front of the Seven Years' War). In the final 30 years of the 18th century, there was a revival of interest in captivity narratives. Accounts such as A Narrative of the Capture and Treatment of John Dodge, by the English at Detroit (1779), A Surprising Account, of the Captivity and Escape of Philip M'Donald, and Alexander M'Leod, of Virginia, from the Chickkemogga Indians (1786), Abraham Panther's A Very Surprising Narrative of a Young Woman, Who Was Discovered in a Rocky Cave (1787), Narrative of the Remarkable Occurrences, in the Life of John Blatchford of Cape-Ann (1788), and A Narrative of the Captivity and Sufferings of Mr. Ebenezer Fletcher, of Newipswich, Who Was ... Taken Prisoner by the British (1798) provided American reading audiences with new narratives. In some accounts, British soldiers were the primary antagonists. =Nova Scotia and Acadia= John Payzant (1749‚Äì1834) ‚Äì captive taken at Lunenburg, Nova Scotia Seven captivity narratives are known that were written following capture of colonists by the Mi'kmaq and Maliseet tribes in Nova Scotia and Acadia (two other prisoners were future Governor Michael Francklin (taken 1754) and Lt John Hamilton (taken 1749) at the Siege of Grand Pre. Whether their captivity experiences were documented is unknown). The most well-known became that by John Gyles, who wrote Memoirs of odd adventures, strange deliverances, &c.; in the captivity of John Gyles, Esq; commander of the garrison on St. George's River (1736). He was captured in the Siege of Pemaquid (1689). He wrote about his torture by the Natives at Meductic village during King William's War. His memoirs are regarded as a precursor to the frontier romances of James Fenimore Cooper, William Gilmore Simms, and Robert Montgomery Bird. Merchant William Pote was captured during the siege of Annapolis Royal during King George's War and wrote about his captivity. Pote also wrote about being tortured. Ritual torture of war captives was common among Native American tribes, who used it as a kind of passage.The Journal of Captain William Pote, Jr. Henry Grace was taken captive by the Mi'kmaq near Fort Cumberland during Father Le Loutre's War. His narrative was entitled, The History of the Life and Sufferings of Henry Grace (Boston, 1764). Anthony Casteel was taken in the Attack at Jeddore during the same war, and also wrote an account of his experience. The fifth captivity narrative, by John Payzant, recounts his being taken prisoner with his mother and sister in the Maliseet and Mi\`kmaq Raid on Lunenburg (1756) during the French and Indian War. After four years of captivity, his sister decided to remain with the natives. In a prisoner exchange, Payzant and his mother returned to Nova Scotia. John Witherspoon was captured at Annapolis Royal during the French and Indian War and wrote about his experience.John Witherspoon, Journal of John Witherspoon, Collections of the Nova Scotia Historical Society, Vol 2, pp. 31‚Äì62. During the war Gamaliel Smethurst was captured; he published an account in 1774. Lt. Simon Stephens, of John Stark's ranger company, and Captain Robert Stobo escaped together from Quebec along the coast of Acadia, finally reaching British-occupied Louisbourg and wrote accounts.A Journal of Lieut. Simon Stevens, from the time of his being taken, near Fort William-Henry, June the 25th 1758. With an account of his escape from Quebec, and his arrival at Louisbourg, on June the 6th, 1759.\\"Captain Robert Stobo (Concluded)\\", ed. George M. Kahrl, The Virginia Magazine of History and Biography Vol. 49, No. 3 (Jul., 1941), pp. 254‚Äì268 During the Petitcodiac River Campaign, the Acadian militia took prisoner William Caesar McCormick of William Stark's rangers and his detachment of three rangers and two light infantry privates from the 35th. The Acadian militia took the prisoners to Miramachi and then Restogouch. (They were kept by Pierre du Calvet who later released them to Halifax.) In August 1758, William Merritt was taken captive close to St. Georges (Thomaston, Maine), and taken to the Saint John River and later to Quebec. =North Africa= British captain witnessing the miseries of Christian slaves in Algiers, 1815 North America was not the only region to produce captivity narratives. North African slave narratives were written by white Europeans and Americans who were captured, often as a result of shipwrecks, and enslaved in North Africa in the 18th and early 19th centuries. If the Europeans converted to Islam and adopted North Africa as their home, they could often end their slavery status, but such actions disqualified them from being ransomed to freedom by European consuls in Africa, who were qualified only to free captives who had remained Christians. About 20,000 British and Irish captives were held in North Africa from the beginning of the 17th century to the middle of the 18th, and roughly 700 Americans were held captive as North African slaves between 1785 and 1815. The British captives produced 15 full biographical accounts of their experiences, and the American captives produced more than 100 editions of 40 full-length narratives. Types =Assimilated captives= In his book Beyond Geography: The Western Spirit Against the Wilderness (1980), Frederick W. Turner discusses the effect of those accounts in which white captives came to prefer and eventually adopt a Native American way of life; they challenged European-American assumptions about the superiority of their culture. During some occasions of prisoner exchanges, the white captives had to be forced to return to their original cultures. Children who had assimilated to new families found it extremely painful to be torn from them after several years' captivity. Numerous adult and young captives who had assimilated chose to stay with Native Americans and never returned to live in Anglo-American or European communities. The story of Mary Jemison, who was captured as a young girl (1755) and spent the remainder of her 90 years among the Seneca, is such an example. Where The Spirit Lives, a 1989 film written by Keith Leckie and directed by Bruce Pittman, turns the tables on the familiar white captive/aboriginal captors narrative. It sensitively portrays the plight of Canadian aboriginal children who were captured and sent to residential schools, where they were stripped of their Native identity and forced to conform to Eurocentric customs and beliefs. The story of Patty Hearst, which unfolded primarily in the mid-1970s, represents a special case. She was initially captured by a domestic U.S. terror group called the Symbionese Liberation Army in February, 1974. About a year later, she was photographed wielding a machine gun, helping them rob a bank. Was she an \\"assimilated captive\\" or was she only cooperating as a matter of survival? Was she \\"brainwashed\\" or fully conscious, acting with free will? These questions were hotly debated at the time.See Bodi, Anna E., \\"Patty Hearst: A Media Heiress Caught in Media Spectacle\\" (2013). CMC Senior Theses. Paper 639, for a more comprehensive and nuanced look at the Patty Hearst phenomenon than is found in most individual articles. Bodi repeatedly poses the dialectic between free choice and agency. =Anti-cult captivity narratives= Out of thousands of religious groups, a handful have become associated with acts of violence. This includes the Peoples Temple founded by Jim Jones in 1955, which ended in a murder/suicide claiming the lives of 918 people in November, 1978 in Guyana (see main article: Peoples Temple). Members of the Peoples Temple who did not die in the murder/suicide are examples of \\"cult survivors\\", and the cult survivor meme has become a popular one. A recent American sitcom, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, is premised on the notion of \\"cult survivor\\" as a social identity. It is not unusual for anyone who grew up in a religious and culturally conservative household ‚Äì and who later adopted secular mainstream values ‚Äì to describe themselves as a \\"cult survivor\\", notwithstanding the absence of any abuse or violence. In this sense, \\"cult survivor\\" may be used as a polemical term in connection with the so-called \\"culture war\\". Not all anti-cult captivity narratives describe physical capture. Sometimes the capture is a metaphor, as is the escape or rescue. The \\"captive\\" may be someone who claims to have been \\"seduced\\" or \\"recruited\\" into a religious lifestyle which he/she retrospectively describes as one of slavery. The term \\"captive\\" may nonetheless be used figuratively. Some captivity narratives are partly or even wholly fictional, but are meant to impart a strong moral lesson, such as the purported dangers of conversion to a minority faith. Perhaps the most notorious work in this subgenre is The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,Ruth Hughes on \\"The Awful Disclosures of Maria Monk,\\" University of Pennsylvania a fictional work circulated during the 19th century and beyond, and used to stoke anti-Catholic sentiment in the U.S. (see main article: Maria Monk). She claimed to have been born into a Protestant family, but was exposed to Roman Catholicism by attending a convent school. She subsequently resolved to become a Catholic nun, but upon admission to the order at the H√¥tel-Dieu nunnery in Montreal, was soon made privy to its dark secrets: the nuns were required to service the priests sexually, and the children born of such liaisons were murdered and buried in a mass grave on the building's premises. Though the Maria Monk work has been exposed as a hoax, it typifies those captivity narratives which depict a minority religion as not just theologically incorrect, but fundamentally abusive. In Rape-Revenge Films: A Critical Study, Alexandra Heller-Nicholas writes: > The basic structure of the captivity narrative concerns the rescue of > \\"helpless\\" maidens who have been kidnapped by \\"natives\\"[.] [They are] > rescued at the last possible moment by a \\"hero.\\" Commonly, this \\"hero\\" is > rewarded through marriage.

Lewis, David G. Bromley is a scholar of religion who draws parallels between the propaganda function of 19th century captivity narratives concerning Native peoples, and contemporary captivity narratives concerning new religious movements. Bromley notes that apostates from such movements frequently cast their accounts in the form of captivity narratives. This in turn provides justification for anti-cult groups to target religious movements for social control measures like deprogramming. In The Politics of Religious Apostasy, Bromley writes: > [T]here is considerable pressure on individuals exiting Subversive > organizations to negotiate a narrative with the oppositional coalition that > offers an acceptable explanation for participation in the organization and > for now once again reversing loyalties.

Bromley, \\"The Social > Construction of Contested Exit Roles\\", in The Politics of Religious > Apostasy, p.37 \\"Cult survivor\\" tales have become a familiar genre. They employ the devices of the captivity narrative in dramatic fashion, typically pitting mainstream secular values against the values held by some spiritual minority (which may be caricatured). As is true of the broader category, anti-cult captivity narratives are sometimes regarded with suspicion due to their ideological underpinnings, their formulaic character, and their utility in justifying social control measures. In addition, critics of the genre tend to reject the \\"mind control\\" thesis, and to observe that it is extremely rare in Western nations for religious or spiritual groups to hold anyone physically captive.See J. Gordon Melton, \\"Brainwashing and Cults: The Rise and Fall of a Theory\\" Like captivity narratives in general, anti-cult captivity narratives also raise contextual concerns. Ethnohistoric Native American culture differs markedly from Western European culture. Each may have its merits within its own context. Modern theorists question the fairness of pitting one culture against another and making broad value judgments. Similarly, spiritual groups may adopt a different way of life than the secular majority, but that way of life may have merits within its own context. Spiritual beliefs, rituals, and customs are not necessarily inferior simply because they differ from the secular mainstream. Anti-cult captivity narratives which attempt to equate difference with abuse, or to invoke a victim paradigm, may sometimes be criticized as unfair by scholars who believe that research into religious movements should be context-based and value-free.See Eileen Barker, \\"The Scientific Study of Religion? You must be joking!\\" Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion Vol. 34, No. 3 (Sep., 1995), pp. 287‚Äì310. Beliefs, rituals, and customs which we assumed were merely \\"primitive\\" or \\"strange\\" may turn out to have profound meaning when examined in their own context.See Heyrman, Christine Leigh. \\"Native American Religion in Early America\\". Divining America, TeacherServe¬Æ. National Humanities Center. Accessed Oct-16-2015. Just as Where the Spirit Lives may be viewed as a \\"reverse\\" captivity narrative concerning Native peoples, the story of Donna Seidenberg Bavis (as recounted in The Washington PostJanis Johnson, \\"Deprogram\\", The Washington Post, May 21, 1977.) may be viewed as a \\"reverse\\" captivity narrative concerning new religious movements. The typical contemporary anti-cult captivity narrative is one in which a purported \\"victim\\" of \\"cult mind control\\" is \\"rescued\\" from a life of \\"slavery\\" by some form of deprogramming or exit counseling. However, Donna Seidenberg Bavis was a Hare Krishna devotee (member of ISKCON) who ‚Äì according to a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the American Civil Liberties Union ‚Äì was abducted by deprogrammers in February 1977, and held captive for 33 days. During that time, she was subjected to abusive treatment in an effort to \\"deprogram\\" her of her religious beliefs. She escaped her captors by pretending to cooperate, then returned to the Krishna temple in Potomac, Maryland. She subsequently filed a lawsuit claiming that her freedom of religion had been violated by the deprogramming attempt, and that she had been denied due process as a member of a hated class. = Satanic captivity narratives = Among anti-cult captivity narratives, a subgenre is the Satanic Ritual Abuse story, the best-known example being Michelle Remembers.See \\"Satanic Ritual Abuse\\" in The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions edited by James R. Lewis, p.636 In this type of narrative, a person claims to have developed a new awareness of previously unreported ritual abuse as a result of some form of therapy which purports to recover repressed memories, often using suggestive techniques. Michelle Remembers represents the cult survivor tale at its most extreme. In it, Michelle Smith recounts horrific tales of sexual and physical abuse at the hands of the \\"Church of Satan\\" over a five-year interval. However, the book has been extensively debunked, and is now considered most notable for its role in contributing to the Satanic Ritual Abuse scare of the 1980s, which culminated in the McMartin preschool trial. = Children's novels inspired by captivity narratives = Captivity narratives, in addition to appealing to adults, have been attracting today's children as well. The narratives' exciting nature and their resilient young protagonists make for very educational and entertaining children's novels that have for goal to convey the \\"American characteristics of resourcefulness, hopefulness, pluck and purity\\". Elizabeth George Speare published Calico Captive (1957), a historical fiction children's novel inspired by the captivity narrative of Susannah Willard Johnson. In Rewriting the Captivity Narrative for Contemporary Children: Speare, Bruchac, and the French and Indian War (2011), Sara L. Schwebel writes: > Johnson's Narrative vividly describes Susanna Johnson's forty-eight-month > ordeal - the terror of being taken captive, childbirth during the forced > march, prolonged separation from her three young children, degradation and > neglect in a French prison, the loss of a newborn, a battle with smallpox, > separation from her husband, and finally, widowhood as her spouse fell in > yet another battle in the years-long French and Indian war.

Conclusions This article references captivity narratives drawn from literature, history, sociology, religious studies, and modern media. Scholars point to certain unifying factors. Of early Puritan captivity narratives, David L. Minter writes: > First they became instruments of propaganda against Indian \\"devils\\" and > French \\"Papists.\\" Later, ... the narratives played an important role in > encouraging government protection of frontier settlements. Still later they > became pulp thrillers, always gory and sensational, frequently plagiaristic > and preposterous.Minter, David L. \\"By Dens of Lions: Notes on Stylization in > Early Puritan Captivity Narratives\\" in American Literature, Vol. 45, No. 3 > (Nov., 1973), pp. 335‚Äì347, Abstract. In its \\"Terms & Themes\\" summary of captivity narratives, the University of Houston at Clear Lake suggests that: The Oxford Companion to United States History indicates that the wave of Catholic immigration after 1820: > provided a large, visible enemy and intensified fears for American > institutions and values.

Alexandra Heller-Nicholas (quoted earlier) points to the presence of a \\"helpless\\" maiden, and a \\"hero\\" who rescues her. Together, these analyses suggest that some of the common elements we may encounter in different types of captivity narratives include: * A captor portrayed as quintessentially evil * A suffering victim, often female * A romantic or sexual encounter occurring in an \\"alien\\" culture * An heroic rescue, often by a male hero * An element of propaganda Notable captivity narratives = 15th century = * Johann Schiltberger (1460), Reisebuch = 16th‚Äì17th century = * √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca (1542), La Relacion (The Report); Translated as The Narrative of Cabeza De Vaca by Rolena Adorno and Patrick Charles Pautz. * Hans Staden (1557), True Story and Description of a Country of Wild, Naked, Grim, Man- eating People in the New World, America * Hernando de Escalante Fontaneda (1575), Memoir On the Country and Ancient Indian Tribes Of Florida * Francisco N√∫√±ez de Pineda y Bascu√±√°n (1673), Cautiverio feliz y raz√≥n individual de las guerras dilatadas del reino de Chile (Happy Captivity and Reason for the Prolonged Wars of the Kingdom of Chile) * Fern√£o Mendes Pinto (1614), Pilgrimage * Anthony Knivet (1625), The Admirable Adventures and Strange Fortunes of Master Antonie Knivet * Robert Knox (1659‚Äì1678), An Historical Relation of the Island Ceylon * Hendrick Hamel (1668), Hamel's Journal and a Description of the Kingdom of Korea, 1653‚Äì1666 * Mary Rowlandson (1682), The Sovereignty and Goodness of God * Cotton Mather (1696‚Äì97), The Captivity of Hannah Dustan = 18th century = * John Williams (Reverend), The Redeemed Captive (1709) * Robert Drury, Madagascar, or Robert Drury's Journal (1729) * John Gyles, Memoirs of odd adventures, strange deliverances, &c.; in the captivity of John Gyles, Esq; commander of the garrison on St. George's River (1736) * Thomas Pellow (1740), The History of the Long Captivity and Adventures of Thomas Pellow * William Walton, The Captivity of Benjamin Gilbert and His Family, 1780‚Äì83 * Mercy Harbison, The Capture and Escape of Mercy Harbison, 1792 (1792) * Susannah Willard Johnson, A Narrative of the Captivity of Mrs. Johnson, Containing an Account of Her Sufferings During Four Years With the Indians and French (1796) * Ann Eliza Bleecker, The History of Maria Kittle (1797), novel * James Smith, An Account of the Remarkable Occurrences ... in the years 1755, '56, '57, '58 & 59 (1799) = 19th century = * John R.

The dynasty was a branch of the Arsacid dynasty of Parthia. Arsacid kings reigned intermittently throughout the chaotic years following the fall of the Artaxiad dynasty until 62 when Tiridates I secured Parthian Arsacid rule in Armenia. However, he did not succeed in establishing his line on the throne, and various Arsacid members of different lineages ruled until the accession of Vologases II, who succeeded in establishing his own line on the Armenian throne, which would rule the country until it was abolished by the Sasanian Empire in 428. Two of the most notable events under Arsacid rule in Armenian history were the conversion of Armenia to Christianity by Gregory the Illuminator in 301 and the creation of the Armenian alphabet by Mesrop Mashtots in c. 405. The reign of the Arsacids of Armenia marked the predominance of Iranianism in the country. Early Arsacids right The first appearance of an Arsacid on the Armenian throne came about in 12 when the Parthian King Vonones I was exiled from Parthia due to his pro-Roman policies and Occidental manners.Josephus, Jewish Antiquities, 18.42‚Äì47 Vonones I briefly acquired the Armenian throne with Roman consent, but Artabanus III demanded his deposition, and as Emperor Augustus did not wish to begin a war with the Parthians he deposed Vonones I and sent him to Syria. Artabanus III did not waste time after the deposition of Vonones I; he installed his son Orodes on the Armenian throne. Emperor Tiberius had no intention of giving up the buffer states of the Eastern frontier and sent his nephew and heir Germanicus to the East. Germanicus concluded a treaty with Artabanus III, in which he was recognized as king and friend of the Romans. Armenia was given in 18 to Zeno the son of Polemon I of Pontus, who assumed the Armenian name Artaxias (aka Zeno-Artaxias).Tacitus, Annals, 2.43, 2.56 The Parthians under Artabanus III were too distracted by internal strife to oppose the Roman- appointed King. Zeno's reign was remarkably peaceful in Armenian history. After Zeno's death in 36, Artabanus III decided to reinstate an Arsacid over the Armenian throne, choosing his eldest son Arsaces I as a suitable candidate, but his succession to the Armenian throne was disputed by his younger brother Orodes who was previously overthrown by Zeno. Tiberius quickly concentrated more forces on the Roman frontier and once again after a decade of peace, Armenia was to become the theater of bitter warfare between the two greatest powers of the known world for the next twenty-five years. Tiberius, sent an Iberian named Mithridates, who claimed to be of Arsacid blood. Mithridates successfully subjugated Armenia to the Roman rule and deposed Arsaces inflicting huge devastation to the country. Surprisingly, Mithridates was summoned back to Rome where he was kept a prisoner, and Armenia was given back to Artabanus III who gave the throne to his younger son Orodes. Another civil war erupted in Parthia upon Artabanus III's death. In the meantime Mithridates was put back on the Armenian throne, with the help of his brother, Pharasmanes I, and Roman troops. Civil war continued in Parthia for several years with Gotarzes eventually seizing the throne in 45. In 51 Mithridates‚Äô nephew Rhadamistus (a.k.a. Ghadam) invaded Armenia and killed his uncle. The governor of Cappadocia, Julius Pailinus, decided to conquer Armenia but he settled with the crowning of Radamistus who generously rewarded him. The current Parthian King Vologases I, saw an opportunity, invaded Armenia and succeeded in forcing the Iberians to withdraw from Armenia. The harsh winter that followed proved too much for the Parthians who also withdrew, thus leaving open doors for Radamistus to regain his throne. After regaining power, according to Tacitus, the Iberian was so cruel that the Armenians stormed the palace and forced Radamistus out of the country and Vologases I got the opportunity to install his brother Tiridates on the throne. Between Rome and Parthia Unhappy with the growing Parthian influence at their doorstep, Roman Emperor Nero sent General Gnaeus Domitius Corbulo with a large army to the east in order to install Roman client kings (see Roman‚ÄìParthian War of 58‚Äì63). After Tiridates I escaped, Roman client king Tigranes VI was installed and in 61 he invaded the Kingdom of Adiabene, which was one of the Parthian vassal kingdoms. Vologases I considered this as an act of aggression from Rome and restarted a campaign to restore Tiridates I onto the Armenian throne. In the following battle of Rhandeia in 62, command of the Roman troops was again entrusted to Corbulo, who marched into Armenia and set a camp in Rhandeia, where he made a peace agreement with Tiridates upon which he was recognized as a king of Armenia but he agreed to become Roman client king in that he would go to Rome to be crowned by Emperor Nero. Tiridates ruled Armenia until his death or deposition around 110 when Parthian king Osroes I invaded Armenia and throned his nephew Axidares, son of the previous Parthian king Pacorus II, as King of Armenia. Greater Armenia as part of the Roman Empire (in red), Lesser Armenia (in blue); 117 AD Arshakid Mausoleum: 4th century This encroachment on the traditional sphere of influence of the Roman Empire ended the peace since Emperor Nero's times some half century earlier and started a new war with the new Roman Emperor Trajan.Statius Silvae 5.1; Dio Cassius 68.17.1.; Arrian Parthica frs 37/40 Trajan marched towards Armenia in October 113 to restore a Roman client king in Armenia. Envoys from Osroes I met Trajan at Athens, informing him that Axidares had been deposed and asking that Axidares' elder brother, Parthamasiris, be granted the throne. Trajan declined their proposal and in August 114 captured Arsamosata where Parthamasiris asked to be crowned, but instead of crowning him he annexed his kingdom as a new province to the Roman Empire. Dio Cassius 68.17.2‚Äì3 Parthamasiris was dismissed and died mysteriously soon afterwards. As a Roman province Armenia was administered along with Cappadocia by Lucius Catilius Severus. The Roman Senate issued coins which had celebrated this occasion and had borne the following inscription: ARMENIA ET MESOPOTAMIA IN POTESTATEM P.R. REDACT√Ü, thus solidifying Armenia's position as the newest Roman province. After a rebellion led by a pretender to the Parthian throne (Sanatruces II, son of Mithridates IV), was put down, some sporadic resistance continued and Vologases III managed to secure a sizeable chunk of Armenia just before Trajan's death in August 117. However, in 118 the new Emperor Hadrian gave up Trajan's conquered lands, including Armenia, and installed Parthamaspates as King of Armenia and Osroene, although the Parthian King Vologases held most of Armenian territory. Eventually compromise with the Parthians was reached and Parthian Vologases was placed in charge of Armenia. Vologase ruled Armenia until 140. Vologases IV, son of legitimate Parthian king Mithridates IV, dispatched his troops to seize Armenia in 161 and eradicated the Roman legions stationed there under legatus Gaius Severianus. Encouraged by the spahbod Osroes, Parthian troops marched further West into Roman Syria.Sellwood Coinage of Parthia 257‚Äì260, 268‚Äì277; Debevoise History of Parthia 245; Dio Cass.71.2.1. Marcus Aurelius immediately sent Lucius Verus to the Eastern front. In 163, Verus dispatched General Statius Priscus, who was recently transferred from Britain along with several legions, from Syrian Antioch to Armenia. The Artaxata army under Vologases IV' command surrendered to Roman general Priscus who installed a Roman puppet, Sohaemus (Roman senator and consul of Arsacid and Emessan ancestry), on the Armenian throne, deposing a certain Pacorus installed by Vologases III.HA Marcus Antoninus 9.1, Verus 7.1; Dio Cass. 71.3.

As a result of an epidemic within the Roman forces, Parthians retook most of their lost territory in 166 and forced Sohaemus to retreat to Syria.HA Verus 8.1‚Äì4; Dio Cass. 71.2. After a few intervening Roman and Parthian rulers, Vologases II assumed the throne in 186. In 198 Vologases II assumed the Parthian throne and named his son Khosrov I to the Armenian throne. Khosrov I was subsequently captured by the Romans, who installed one of their own to take charge of Armenia. However the Armenians themselves revolted against their Roman overlords, and in accordance to new Rome-Parthia compromise, Khosrov I's son, Tiridates II (217‚Äì252), was made king of Armenia. Sassanids and Armenia In 224 the Persian king Ardashir I overthrew the Arsacids in Parthia and found the new Persian Sassanid dynasty. The Sassanids were determined to restore the old glory of the Achaemenid Persia, so they proclaimed Zoroastrianism as the state religion and considered Armenia as part of their empire. To preserve the autonomy of Arsacid rule in Armenia, Tiridates II sought friendly relations with Rome. This was an unfortunate choice, because the Sassanid king Shapur I defeated the Romans and made peace with the emperor Philip. In 252 Shapur I invaded Armenia and forced Tiridates II to flee. After the deaths of Tiridates II and his son Khosrov II, Shapur I installed his own son Hurmazd on the Armenian throne. When Shapur I died in 270, Hurmazd took the Persian throne and his brother Narseh ruled Armenia in his name. Under Diocletian, Rome installed Tiridates III as ruler of Armenia, and in 287 he was in possession of the western parts of Armenian territory. The Sassanids stirred some nobles to revolt when Narseh left to take the Persian throne in 293. Rome nevertheless defeated Narseh in 298, and Khosrov II's son Tiridates III regained control over Armenia with the support of Roman soldiers. Christianization Anachronistic painting of baptism of king Tiridates III (Trdat III) by St. Gregory the Enlightener. As late as the later Parthian period, Armenia was predominantly Zoroastrian.Mary Boyce. Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices Psychology Press, 2001 p 84 However, this was soon to change. In 301, Saint Gregory the Illuminator converted king Tiridates III and members of his court to ChristianityAcademic American Encyclopedia ‚Äì Page 172 by Grolier Incorporated traditionally dated to 301 according to historian Mikayel Chamchian's ‚ÄúPatmutiun Hayots i Skzbane Ashkharhi Minchev tsam diarn‚Äù (1784).Estimated dates vary from 284 to 314. 314 is the date favored by mainstream scholarship, so Garso√Øan (op.cit. p.82), following the research of Ananian, and Seibt (2002) The Armenian alphabet was created by Saint Mesrop Mashtots in 405 AD for the purpose of Bible translation, and Christianization as thus also marks the beginning of Armenian literature. According to Movses Khorenatsi, Isaac of Armenia made a translation of the Gospel from the Syriac text about 411. This work must have been considered imperfect, because soon afterward John of Egheghiatz and Joseph of Baghin, two of Mashtots' students, were sent to Edessa to translate the Biblical scriptures. They journeyed as far as Constantinople, and brought back with them authentic copies of the Greek text. With the help of other copies obtained from Alexandria the Bible was translated again from the Greek according to the text of the Septuagint and Origen's Hexapla. This version, now used by the Armenian Church, was completed about 434. Decline During the reign of Tigranes VII (Tiran), the Sassanid King Shapur II invaded Armenia. During the following decades, Armenia was once again disputed territory between the Byzantine Empire and the Sassanid Empire, until a permanent settlement in 387, which remained in place until the Arab conquest of Armenia in 639.

He played professionally as a quarterback in the National Football League (NFL) with the Miami Dolphins (1973‚Äì1987), Cleveland Browns (1988), and Indianapolis Colts (1989). Strock served as the head football coach at Florida International University from 2002 to 2006, compiling a record of 15‚Äì41. Playing career =College= Strock played college football at Virginia Tech. In his senior season in 1972, Strock led the nation in total passing and total offense, yet finished only ninth in voting for the Heisman Trophy. He was voted third-team All-America. The college game was then dominated by running backs; the 1972 Heisman went to wingback Johnny Rodgers of Nebraska.Heisman.com - 1972 voting To date, Strock still holds many collegiate football passing records at his alma mater and was inducted into the Virginia Tech Sports Hall of Fame in 1985. =Professional= Strock played in the National Football League as a quarterback. A 5th round selection (111th overall pick) of the 1973 NFL Draft, he spent the majority of his professional career with the Miami Dolphins (1973‚Äì1987), and was mostly known for his role as a back-up to Hall-of Famers Bob Griese in his first years with the team and Dan Marino as he finished his career with the club. He also played one season with the Cleveland Browns (1988) and part of a season on the roster of the Indianapolis Colts (1989) before retiring as a player. Strock was a member of the \\"taxi squad\\" during the 1973 season when the Dolphins won their second straight Super Bowl following the undefeated 1972‚Äì73 season. He was also a member of the Dolphin teams who played and lost in the 1982 and 1984 Super Bowls. Strock is well-remembered for coming off the bench on January 2, 1982, for the Miami Dolphins in an AFC Divisional Playoff Game against the San Diego Chargers at the Miami Orange Bowl. Strock led Miami from a 24‚Äì0 deficit to tie the score in the 3rd quarter. Ultimately, Miami lost the game to San Diego, 41‚Äì38, in overtime. The game is also remembered for the image of San Diego tight end Kellen Winslow being helped off the field by his teammates after the game while suffering from exhaustion. Strock finished the game with 29 of 43 completions for 403 yards and four touchdowns, with one interception. The game later became known as The Epic in Miami and has entered NFL lore as one of the greatest games ever in NFL history. Coaching career =Arena Football League, the World League and the NFL= Strock began his coaching career as the head coach of the Miami Hooters of the Arena Football League for one season in 1993. The following season, he moved on to be the head coach of the Massachusetts Marauders and again only stayed for one season. He then moved on to be an assistant coach of the Rhein Fire in the World League during 1995 season. Between 1996‚Äì1998 seasons, he was the quarterbacks coach of the Baltimore Ravens in the NFL. =Florida International University= On September 13, 2000, Strock was named the first head football coach in FIU's history. He was named to the position just shy of two years before the university's inaugural football game. Prior to being named head coach he was the director of football operations, a job he had obtained the year before. His overall record through the 2006 football season was 15‚Äì41. On November 15, 2006 Strock resigned as head coach of the FIU Golden Panthers. Of his 15 career victories, none came during the 2006 campaign and only three of them came against NCAA Division I-A opponents. His resignation came after an 0‚Äì9 start and a much-publicized brawl against the University of Miami Hurricanes caused 16 players from FIU to be suspended. His resignation became effective following FIU's last game against Troy University on December 2, 2006.

Route description Southern end, near Eastpoint The route begins at US 98/319 in Green Point, a rural community east of Eastpoint on the Gulf of Mexico in Franklin County, Florida. For the road's first it runs straight north,Google Street View; State Road 65 from southern terminus to first curve. and after this curves to the northwest. From here the road becomes North Shore Bay Road and winds around the southern border of the Tates Hell Swamp. As the road enters Beverly, it faces an at-grade crossing with an Apalachicola Northern Railroad line and then curves straight north again where it enters Apalachicola National Forest. In Buck Siding that line begins to run parallel to the east side of SR 65 and continues to do so as it crosses the Franklin- Liberty County Line. No sooner does the road cross that county line than it enters an unincorporated community named Sumatra where it has an intersection with County Road 22, also known as National Forest Route 175 and then County Road 379. Just around the intersection of NF Road 180, SR 65 curves to the northeast, where from here it spends the rest of its journey through the forest running from southwestern to northeastern Liberty County. In Wilma SR 65 has a wye intersection with County Road 12, a county road that wouldn't seem so important at the time but will prove to be important later on. Emerging from the forest, SR 65 enters Telogia where it has an intersection with County Road 67 and later the northwestern terminus of County Road 67A. North of this community the road crosses a bridge over the Telogia Creek and then has an intersection with the western terminus of County Road 2224 (Blue Creek Road, formerly CR 267). Curving straight north in front of a cemetery, SR 65 enters Hosford, Florida where it continues on this trajectory for more than four blocks. After the intersection with Tin Can Road and Woodman Street, SR 65 serves as the western border for Hosford Elementary-Junior High School, before curving to the northeast again where it has a major intersection with State Road 20 at a blinker-light intersection. Continuing its northeast curve, it passes by a man-made lake leading to a tributary of Telogia Creek and then a power sub-station before briefly curving more to the north. Eventually this trajectory too shall end as it crosses the very Apalachicola Northern Railroad line it followed since Buck Siding. The rest of the way, SR 65 continues to wind towards the northeast as it crosses the Liberty-Gadsden County Line, and adopts the name Hosford Highway. Just after crossing the county line, SR 65 runs over a bridge over Ocklawaha Creek and runs through a parcel of land known as the Forbes Purchase. During its time in this region, the road serves as the western terminus of County Road 65B (Old Federal Road) and then the southeastern terminus of County Road 65A. In Sawdust SR 65 has an intersection with County Road 274. Just before curving straight north, the road serves as the northeastern terminus of County Road 65A just south of the bridge over Interstate 10. Despite being a state road, SR 65 has no access to I-10, which it crosses over with a two-lane bridge. The road takes one last curve to the northeast before a wye intersection with State Road 12 where the route ends. Apart from several SR 65 shields in Quincy that refer to County Road 65, there are no signs connecting the two 65s. History Originally, SR 65 was co- signed with US 90 to Quincy, then north alone to the Georgia border, where it becomes State Route 241. Sometime in the 1990s , FDOT downgraded the stretch of SR 65 from Quincy to the Georgia border to the Gadsden County government, in which that segment became County Road 65.FDOT Map of Gadsden County, Florida (including SR 65 & CR 65) Major intersections Related routes State Road 65 contains eight related county roads, all of which are in Gadsden County, Florida. These include a county extension of a former segment of SR 65, and several suffixed alternate routes, many of which are duplicates of one another. =County Road 65= County Road 65 is the county extension of SR 65 north from Quincy. The route begins as North Madison Avenue, then becomes Attapulgus Highway north of the city limits. As Attapulgus Highway, the route winds around the outskirts of Quincy before curving primarily towards the northeast. County Road 65 crosses the Florida-Georgia State Line west of Dogtown, and becomes State Route 241. =County Road 65A= County Road 65A is a suffixed alternate county route of SR 65 that can actually be found in one of three locations in Gadsden County. The first and southernmost CR 65A is named Juniper Creek Road, a loop road on the west side of SR 65 in rural Gadsden County southeast of Greensboro and around Sawdust. The only moderate intersections are with the eastern terminus of CR 65D and CR 274. The road ends at SR 65 on the south side of the bridge over I-10. A former segment of this road can be found on the northwest corner of this bridge as Breeden Road, which becomes a dead end street north of the right-of-way of I-10. The second CR 65A is Dewey Johnson Way which begins just east of the north end of SR 65 near Douglas City and runs directly south to north. The sole moderate intersection along this road is CR 270A, which has a connecting spur on the northwest corner. The route ends at CR 268 in Gretna. The third, and northernmost CR 65A is Porter Mitchell Road which runs northwest from CR 65 to the Florida-Georgia State Line. Upon crossing the border, the road keeps the name Porter Mitchell Road. =County Road 65B= County Road 65B is another county suffixed alternate route of SR 65, that can be found in two locations in Gadsden County. The southernmost CR 65B is named Old Federal Road. It runs southeast from SR 65 towards the Lake Talquin area. In the vicinity of the Bear Creek Preserve, CR 65B intersects State Road 267 which also leads to CR 65C. The road makes a sharp northeast turn just before the intersection of Bear Creek Road. One other moderate intersection can be found along this segment, specifically CR 267A (Spooner Road), which is shared with a dirt road named Magnolia Farm Road. This segment of CR 65B ends at CR 268 (Highbridge Road) three blocks southeast of a bridge over I-10. The northernmost CR 65B is named Bettstown Road, which unlike Old Federal Road actually connects to one of the other county-suffixed alternates rather than to SR 65 or CR 65. The route runs west from CR 65A then curves northwest to the Florida-Georgia State Line. Unlike nearby CR 65A however, the name of the street changes to Betts Community Road upon crossing the border. =County Road 65C= County Road 65C is named McCall Bridge Road, and does not connect to either SR 65 or CR 65. In fact, there's very little evidence it even connects to a suffixed alternate of these routes, other than the possibility of a hidden concurrency with State Road 267 towards southern CR 65B. The road begins at SR 267 at the Wetumpka Volunteer Fire Department, and runs southeast through the Bear Creek Recreational Area of Lake Talquin State Park. Before entering the park, it passes by the Antioch Cemetery. Just east of the park, it encounters the northern terminus of Lakeview Point Road, which leads to the Lakeview Point Boat Ramp. The road then turns to the south itself near Bear Creek Road. County Road 65C ends on the north shore of Lake Talquin at a boat ramp of its own. =County Road 65D= County Road 65D is another county suffixed alternate of SR 65, which actually connects to one of the other county suffixed alternates. The entire road is named Telogia Creek Road and runs east and west from SR 12 to southern CR 65A south of Greensboro.

It was the last three-year regiment raised in New Hampshire, serving from September 24, 1862, to July 8, 1865. Carroll Davidson Wright was one of its regimental leaders. The regiment lost a total of 232 men during its service; 8 officers and 63 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, 4 officers and 151 enlisted men by disease. History Unidentified soldier with the 14th New Hampshire On September 24, 1862, the regiment was organized and mustered in Concord, New Hampshire. In October 1862, the 14th NH arrived in Washington, D.C., where it camped on East Capitol Hill before establishing winter quarters at Poolesville, Maryland. From November 1862 to April 1863, the 14th NH served picket duty along the upper Potomac River. In April 1863, the regiment moved its quarters to Camp Adirondack, in northeast Washington D.C. From April 1863 to the end of the year, the 14th NH performed guard duty at Old Capitol Prison, transporting prisoners and deserters, and at the Navy Yard Bridge (Benning's Bridge). In early 1864, the 14th NH briefly performed picket duty in the Shenandoah Valley. The regiment returned to New Hampshire to vote in the spring elections which were heavily contested. On March 16, 1864, the 14th N.H. departed for Louisiana to participate in the Red River Campaign, but arrived after it had ended. The regiment served at Camp Parapet, Carrollton, and Jefferson City until June 1864, when they returned to Virginia. The 14th served at Fortress Monroe and Berryville in Virginia until the end of July 1864. From August to December 1864, the regiment was part of General Sheridan's Army of the Shenandoah, and participated in the Third Battle of Winchester, on September 19, 1864, with heavy losses at the Battle of Fisher's Hill on September 22, 1864, and the Battle of Cedar Creek on October 19, 1864. Sergeant Major J. Henry Jenks, from Keene, New Hampshire, was the last man from this unit to fall in battle on October 19, 1864, in the Battle of Cedar Creek. At the conclusion of the Civil War, the 14th NH was stationed near Augusta and Savannah, Georgia. On July 8, 1865, the 14th New Hampshire Volunteer Regiment was mustered out in Savannah.

The naiskos (pl.: naiskoi; , diminutive of ŒΩŒ±œåœÇ \\"temple\\") is a small temple in classical order with columns or pillars and pediment. Often applied as an artificial motif, it is common in ancient art. It also found in the funeral architecture of the ancient Attic cemeteries as grave reliefs or shrines with statues for example the stele of Aristonautes from Kerameikos in Athenshttp://odysseus.culture.gr/h/4/eh430.jsp?obj_id=5425 and in the black- figure and red-figure pottery of Ancient Greece at the Loutrophoros and the Lekythos and the red-figure wares of Apulia in South Italy.https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/collection_object_details.aspx?objectId=463274&partId;=1 There also exist naiskos-type figurines or other types of temples formed in terracotta; examples abound at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The form of the naiskos suggests a religious context, relating especially to Greek funerary cult. Some of the Hellenistic inscriptions found in the Bay of Grama are placed inside a naiskos, and in this case the religious context is an invocation of Castor and Pollux (Dioskouroi) for a safe passage across the Adriatic, rather than funerary.http://www.persee.fr/doc/reg_0035-2039_2007_num_120_2_7870 A similar style, called the aedicula, is observed in Roman art.

SC-1012 was built by the Fellows and Craft Shipbuilders and launched on 28 December 1942. Commissioned on 18 August 1943. She was involved in several campaigns during World War II and traveled many miles across and throughout the South Pacific escorting convoys, providing Harbormaster duties and pre-invasion reconnaissance. Service history In February 1944, the SC-1012, commanded by Lt. (jg) E. Gordon Myers (22 January 1918-4 July 1962) was in a convoy when was torpedoed. The escort ships, and along with SC-1012, formed a Hunter-Killer group and began a systematic search for the submarine which had torpedoed her. No confirmed kill was recorded, but no further offensive action was seen from the submarine. During the SC-1012s Harbormaster duties, in the Keramerati Island Group, they had just escorted an ammunition ship to dock; when SC-1012 was targeted by a kamikaze. The crew was at battle stations and had just prepared to open fire when the pilot, apparently spotting a better target, broke off his attack and slammed into the ammunition ship, which burned for three or four days. During the pre-invasion reconnaissance of the islands, Col. \\"Squeeky\\" Anderson was the commanding officer for the landing forces. He would routinely board SC-1012 and go with them to map out the landing zones. During the actual invasion, SC-1012 would stand by at a preset location and the landing craft would then home in on her, aiming to the right or the left of where SC-1012 was stationed. This type of \\"spotting\\" enabled the landing ships to hit their target without using any other guidance systems. SC-1012 was extremely fortunate in not losing any crewmembers to any sort of enemy action. However, she was damaged beyond repair when Typhoon Louise hit the Seaplane Base on Okinawa in October 1945, and the SC-1012 was destroyed on 1 January 1946.

He is commonly called Pasa Isageum, isageum being the royal title in early Silla. As a descendant of Silla's founder Hyeokgeose, his surname was Bak. Background According to the Samguk Sagi, he was son of Talhae of Silla, and a woman from Persia. He was Yuri's nephew indicate the powerful support of the Seok clan. Reign In 87, he built Silla's first recorded castles outside of the Gyeongju region. In 94, when the adjacent Gaya confederacy attacked, Pasa sent 1,000 cavalry to respond. When the Gaya attacked again two years later, he personally led a force of 5,000 to another victory. Pasa was subsequently appeased by an emissary from Gaya, but maintained superiority over the confederacy. In 101, the Wolseong royal fortress was first constructed. Portions of this fortress are still preserved in central Gyeongju. The next year, Silla gained control over the previously independent states of Siljikgok (present-day Samcheok), Eumjipbeol (present- day northern Gyeongju), and Apdok (present-day Gyeongsan).

Route description = Okaloosa County(Niceville and Bluewater Bay) = SR 20 starts at SR 85 in Niceville as John Sims Parkway, which goes to Eglin AFB North Gate through Valparaiso as westbound SR 85 and southbound SR 397. SR 20 heads slightly southeast while SR 85 goes north towards Crestview. The road shortly after intersects the southern terminus of SR 285 as it passes by Niceville High School, reducing to four lanes from six lanes. Route 20 continues straight through Niceville before turning more southeast, crossing the C.G. Meigs bridge over Rocky Bayou, exiting the Niceville city limits and entering Bluewater Bay. 3 miles later, the road intersects SR 293, providing access to Destin via the Mid Bay Bridge before reducing to two lanes and entering Walton County. = Walton County = Briefly after crossing the county line, SR 20 continues southeast before turning east into Choctaw Beach, skirting along the Choctawhatchee Bay, as a two lane road. Upon leaving Choctaw Beach, the road increases to 55 mph-60 mph into Portland, intersecting Eglin Site C-6 before intersecting County Highway 83A, a loop road, twice in Freeport. Shortly after the second intersection with CR 83A, the road intersects US 331 Business, which happens to be US 331's old alignment through Freeport. SR 20 shortly after intersects US 331, exiting the town shortly after. Throughout the rest of Walton County, SR 20 does not intersect many roads other than SR 81 in Bruce, continuing eastbound. = Washington County = SR 20 is very short through Washington County, only intersecting SR 79 in Ebro leading to Panama City Beach/Bonifay. The road runs for 5 miles before straddling the Washington/Bay county line for another 6 miles before veering southeast into Bay County. = Bay County = Only about a mile after completely going into Bay County, SR 20 intersects SR 77, passing by several lakes for a few miles before turning northeast. The road intersects Blue Springs Road, then turning directly east and running close to the Washington County line, but still entirely in Bay County. After the county line ends, the road heads straight east, intersecting US 231 between Fountain and Youngstown, and then enters Calhoun County. = Calhoun County = State Road 20 continues heading straight east before veering southeast, then curving northeast, to finally resume the straight eastward pattern. The road becomes the southern terminus of SR 287 before entering a very short concurrency with SR 73 in Clarksville. Outside of it, the route intersects CR 275 between Clarksville and Blountstown. Through Blountstown, SR 20 is known as Central Avenue, still being a two lane road. The road slightly expands to include turn medians, intersecting SR 71, which allows access to SR 69. Shortly after, the road passes by the county sheriff's office and the courthouse. After Blountstown, the road becomes four lane, crossing the Apalachicola River on the Trammell Bridge into Liberty County. = Liberty County = After crossing the Apalachicola River, the road immediately heads into Bristol, remaining a four lane road through the town, intersecting SR 12 in the process. SR 20 then goes slightly southeast, intersecting Dempsey Barron Rd toward Hosford. The route intersects SR 65 in Hosford, after which the road intersects barely any more important roads in the county until it reaches, and running concurrent to, SR 267 right before crossing the Ochlockonee River into Leon County. = Leon County (including Tallahassee) = SR 20/SR 267 intersect CR 375 shortly after crossing county lines right before SR 267 splits from SR 20 as Bloxham Cutoff, going to US 98 heading to Perry, bypassing Tallahassee. SR 20, meanwhile, goes northeast, intersecting many rural roads through Fort Braden. The route goes straight east once more through Apalachicola National Forest before intersecting some more small, local roads while encountering a few stop light intersections. Finally, SR 20 enters Tallahassee and meets SR 263/Capital Circle SW and directly after meets SR 366, which heads east as Pensacola Street leading to Stadium Drive, while SR 20 heads north as Blountstown Street. About 1.3 miles later, SR 20 meets US 90/Tennessee Street and turns right into a hidden concurrency. The two roads head southeast along Tennessee St before drifting northeast and then east. After intersecting Stadium Drive, the roads head southeast again, passing along the north side of Florida State University. Heading directly east into downtown, the routes meet US 27/SR 61/Monroe Street, where SR 20 turns right onto these routes into another hidden concurrency, while US 90 continues as Tennessee Street heading east. Routes 20/27/61 run south along Monroe Street until heading east with US 27 along Apalachee Parkway in front of the Florida Capitol building, while SR 61 continues south along Monroe Street. Routes 20/27 head east along Apalachee Parkway out of Tallahassee, intersecting US 319/Capital Circle SE along the way. The two routes remain four laned throughout the rest of Leon County. = Jefferson County and Madison County = Remaining four laned all the way to Perry, US 27/SR 20 head east, intersecting SR 59. Around halfway between Capps and SR 59 is CR 259 in Waukeenah. In Capps, US 19, heading south from Monticello, join the 20/27 concurrency before the roads go right slightly before going even more southeast heading briefly into Madison County. In Madison County, the roads intersect CR 150 before entering Taylor County. = Taylor County = US 19/SR 20/US 27 head into Taylor County as Byron Butler Parkway, retaining four lanes and southeasterly direction. The routes go almost go perfectly straight for 16.5 miles until they reach Perry, where the routes go briefly south, where an intersection with US 98/Hampton Springs Avenue has US 19 leaving the concurrency with US 27/SR 20 to go along US 98 southbound heading towards St Petersburg, with 20/27 going east along Hampton Springs. A few blocks later, the routes intersect US 221/Jefferson St before leaving Perry and soon afterwards Taylor County, continuing east. = Lafayette County = As a two lane road, US 27/SR 20 head east, intersecting CR 348 and soon after CR 534. Afterwards, the roads head southeast again toward Mayo, where the roads go east, as well as intersecting SR 51, then after Mayo, head southeast once more. Curving slightly northeast, the routes intersect SR 349 and quickly enter Branford in Suwannee County. = Suwannee County/Columbia County = Immediately after crossing the county line, the roads enter the town of Branford, intersecting US 129/SR 249. After Branford, the roads head east to intersect SR 49. Routes 20/27 soon head southeast upon entering Columbia County, intersecting SR 47 in Fort White before CR 18 terminates at the routes, which briefly go south to then resuming their southeasterly direction towards High Springs. = Alachua County = Upon entering Alachua County, routes 20/27 enter High Springs. In the city, the two routes meet with US 41 where US 27 finally parts ways with SR 20 by turning south onto US 41, ending their 120 mile long concurrency. SR 20 is independent (and is a signed route) for a few blocks in High Springs before becoming concurrent with US 441, where it goes into yet another hidden concurrency. The routes head slightly southeast as a four lane road, becoming a moderate exit off of I-75 and entering Alachua, intersecting SR 235. The roads curve to the south as they enter Gainesville, where US 441 goes south onto 13th st while SR 20 heads southeast on 6th street to then go south to parallel US 441. SR 20 then goes east on 8th Avenue and then south onto Main Street before turning east again on SR 24/26. Finally, SR 20/24/26 goes east, then SR 20 goes southeast on Hawthorne Road to Hawthorne, where it intersects US 301, to enter Putnam County. = Putnam County = As SR 20 goes slightly northeast, it intersects SR 21. Going east, the route goes to Interlachen where it intersects CR 315, where the road increases to four lanes to Palatka. The road is kept four lanes through Palatka, where it is known as Crill Avenue, and intersecting SR 19, then heads east to Palm Avenue where it is reduced to two lanes. SR 20 continues to head east along Crill Avenue, then turns north on 9th avenue to US 17, where they cross the St Johns River on the Palatka Memorial Bridge and curve south in East Palatka toward San Mateo, where SR 20 leaves the concurrency with SR 100 from US 17 to head southeast out of Putnam County. = Flagler County = SR 20/100 continue their southeasterly direction for a bit to head straight east to intersect CR 305 and CR 205, then they go east to go into Bunnell, where SR 20 ends at US 1 just after going over an overpass. SR 100, however, goes concurrent with US 1 to Bunnell and continues to SR A1A.

It is located on the Shotts Line, west of towards . It was the sixth-least-used station in the UK until 2018-19 and was the second-least-used in Scotland, after Barry Links. http://orr.gov.uk/__data/assets/excel_doc/0018/15363/station- usage-2013-14-data.xlshttps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-51106246  History  The station was opened by the Caledonian Railway on their Cleland and Midcalder Line on 9 July 1869. Breich is named after the nearby Breich Water. The station pre-dates the present-day (2015) village of Breich and OS maps show that it has never possessed freight facilities such as loading docks and sidings, etc. The station in 1962 The surrounding area, although now very rural, was once highly industrialised with several collieries, lime works, iron workings, etc. nearby, together with the Levenseat Branch of the North British Railway and the originally 4 ft 6in Scotch gauge Wilsontown, Morningside and Coltness line with its old terminus station of Longridge opened in 1845 and closed in 1848.Butt (1995), page 149 A ticket office and waiting room was still present in 1962 as shown by the photograph of that date, together with a linesman's brick hut building, both on the Glasgow bound platform. The final section of the platforms running towards Edinburgh was slightly higher, had larger edging stones and were of a different construction suggesting that they were built at a different date than the rest of the platforms. The station gardens had an unusual diversity of planted shrubs and trees. The station was rebuilt on the same site in 2018 and it has lost the old pedestrian overbridge and wooden shelter. It has new platforms, two modern style passenger shelters, additional outside seating and electronic travel information displays. Access from platform 1 to 2 is via the rebuilt road overbridge. The car parking area is unchanged and the access is ill-defined due to the presence of a crossroads and traffic lights.  Services  = 2011= Mondays to Saturdays saw one train to Edinburgh and two towards Glasgow Central with no Sunday service. = 2018 = Monday to Saturdays the station was served by one eastbound towards Edinburgh and one westbound train towards Glasgow Central per day. There was no Sunday service. = 2019 = From May 2019, an hourly service has been introduced Monday - Saturday and a 2 hourly service on Sundays.  Station usage  In 2014‚Äì15, Breich was the tenth least-used station in Britain, with 92 passenger exits and entries. West Lothian Council's Route Utilisation Strategy suggests that if there was an increase in service frequency on the Shotts Line more services could stop at Breich. This could help future developments in the Breich and Longridge areas.  Proposed closure  On 21 June 2017, Network Rail announced that they had begun consultation on the proposed closure of the station due to low patronage and if retained will avoid heavy expenditure to update the station prior to electrification of the line. It would have been the first station in Scotland to close in over 30 years. The overwhelming response to the consultation was in favour of keeping Breich station open. Many respondents wished to see more services calling at Breich Station to increase patronage. It has been confirmed that the station will remain open and plans are being developed to possibly improve services. The station was closed temporarily from 23 June 2018 for 12 weeks during redevelopment as part of a ¬£2.4 million project to make it suitable for new electric trains. The redevelopment include worked to the platforms in order to make them compliant in both height and length for the new services as well as ensuring ramped access to both platforms and to station facilities such as waiting shelters, CCTV, etc...

Rain gardens are designed landscape sites that reduce the flow rate, total quantity, and pollutant load of runoff from impervious urban areas like roofs, driveways, walkways,and parking lots, and compacted lawn areas. Rain gardens rely on plants and natural or engineered soil medium to retain stormwater and increase the lag time of infiltration, while remediating and filtering pollutants carried by urban runoff. Rain gardens provide a method to reuse and optimize any rain that falls, reducing or avoiding the need for additional irrigation. A benefit of planting rain gardens is the consequential decrease in ambient air and water temperature, a mitigation that is especially effective in urban areas containing an abundance of impervious surfaces that absorb heat in a phenomenon known as the heat-island effect. Rain garden plantings commonly include wetland edge vegetation, such as wildflowers, sedges, rushes, ferns, shrubs and small trees. These plants take up nutrients and water that flow into the rain garden, and they release water vapor back to the atmosphere through the process of transpiration. Deep plant roots also create additional channels for stormwater to filter into the ground. Root systems enhance infiltration, maintain or even augment soil permeability, provide moisture redistribution, and sustain diverse microbial populations involved in biofiltration.B.C. Wolverton, Ph.D., R.C. McDonald- McCaleb (1986). ‚ÄúBiotransformation of Priority Pollutants Using Biofilms and Vascular Plants.‚Äù Journal of the Mississippi Academy of Sciences. Vol. XXXI, pp. 79-89. Microbes help to break down organic compounds (including some pollutants) and remove nitrogen. Rain gardens can improve water quality in nearby bodies of water and recharge depleted groundwater supply. Rain gardens also reduce the amount of polluted runoff that enters the storm sewer system, which discharges directly to surface waters and causes erosion, water pollution and flooding. University of Rhode Island. Healthy Landscapes Program. ‚ÄúRain Gardens: Enhancing your home landscape and protecting water quality.‚Äù Rain gardens also reduce energy consumption by decreasing the load on conventional stormwater infrastructure. Rain gardens are beneficial for many reasons; they improve water quality by filtering runoff, provide localized flood control, create aesthetic landscaping sites, and provide diverse planting opportunities. They also encourage wildlife and biodiversity, tie together buildings and their surrounding environments in integrated and environmentally advantageous ways, and provide significant solutions to important environmental problems that affect many aspects of life. History The first rain gardens were created to mimic the natural water retention areas that developed before urbanization occurred. The rain gardens for residential use were developed in 1990 in Prince George's County, Maryland, when Dick Brinker, a developer building a new housing subdivision had the idea to replace the traditional best management practices (BMP) pond with a bioretention area. He approached Larry Coffman, an environmental engineer and the county's Associate Director for Programs and Planning in the Department of Environmental Resources, with the idea. The result was the extensive use of rain gardens in Somerset, a residential subdivision which has a rain garden on each house's property.Wisconsin Natural Resources (magazine). ‚ÄúRain Gardens Made One Maryland Community Famous.‚Äù February 2003. This system proved to be highly cost-effective. Instead of a system of curbs, sidewalks, and gutters, which would have cost nearly $400,000, the planted drainage swales cost $100,000 to install. This was also much more cost effective than building BMP ponds that could handle 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm events. Flow monitoring done in later years showed that the rain gardens have resulted in a 75‚Äì80% reduction in stormwater runoff during a regular rainfall event. Some de facto rain gardens predate their recognition by professionals as a significant LID (Low Impact Development) tool. Any shallow garden depression implemented to capture and filter rain water within the garden so as to avoid draining water offsite is at conception a rain garden‚Äîparticularly if vegetation is planted and maintained with recognition of its role in this function. Vegetated roadside swales, now promoted as ‚Äúbioswales‚Äù, remain the conventional runoff drainage system in many parts of the world from long before extensive networks of concrete sewers became the conventional engineering practice in the industrialized world. What is new about such technology is the emerging rigor of increasingly quantitative understanding of how such tools may make sustainable development possible. This is as true for developed communities retrofitting bioretention into existing stormwater management infrastructure as it is for developing communities seeking a faster and more sustainable development path. Urban runoff mitigation = Effects of urban runoff = In developed urban areas, naturally occurring depressions where storm water would pool are typically covered by impermeable surfaces, such as asphalt, pavement, or concrete, and are leveled for automobile use. Stormwater is directed into storm drains which may cause overflows of combined sewer systems or pollution, erosion, or flooding of waterways receiving the storm water runoff.Kuichling, E. 1889. \\"The relation between the rainfall and the discharge of sewers in populous districts.\\" Trans. Am. Soc. Civ. Eng. 20, 1‚Äì60.Leopold, L. B. 1968. \\"Hydrology for urban land planning: A guidebook on the hydrologic effects of urban land use.\\" Geological Survey Circular 554. United States Geological Survey.Waananen, A. O. 1969. \\"Urban effects on water yield\\" in W. L. Moore and C. W. Morgan (eds), Effects of Watershed Changes on Streamflow. University of Texas Press, Austin and London. Redirected stormwater is often warmer than the groundwater normally feeding a stream, and has been linked to upset in some aquatic ecosystems primarily through the reduction of dissolved oxygen (DO). Stormwater runoff is also a source of a wide variety of pollutants washed off hard or compacted surfaces during rain events. These pollutants may include volatile organic compounds, pesticides, herbicides, hydrocarbons and trace metals.Novotny, V. and Olem, H. 1994. \\"Water Quality: Prevention, Identification, and Management of Diffuse Pollution.\\" Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York. = Stormwater management systems = Stormwater management occurs on a watershed scale to prevent downstream impacts on urban water quality. A watershed is maintained through the cyclical accumulation, storage, and flow of groundwater. Naturally occurring watersheds are damaged when they are sealed by an impervious surface, which diverts pollutant-carrying stormwater runoff into streams. Urban watersheds are affected by greater quantities of pollutants due to the consequences of anthropogenic activities within urban environments. Rainfall on impermeable surfaces accumulates surface runoff containing oil, bacteria, and sediment that eventually makes its way to streams and groundwater. Stormwater control strategies such as infiltration gardens treat contaminated surface runoff and return processed water to the underlying soil, helping to restore the watershed system. The effectiveness of stormwater control systems is measured by the reduction of the amount of rainfall that becomes runoff (retention), and the lag time (rate of depletion) of the runoff. Even rain gardens with small capacities for daily infiltration can create a positive cumulative impact on mitigating urban runoff. Increasing the amount of permeable surfaces by designing rain gardens reduces the amount of polluted stormwater that reaches natural bodies of water and recharges groundwater at a higher rate. Additionally, adding a rain garden to a site that experiences excessive rainwater runoff mitigates the water quantity load on public stormwater systems. The bioretention approach to water treatment, and specifically rain gardens in this context, is two-fold: to utilize the natural processes within landscapes and soils to transport, store, and filter stormwater before it becomes runoff, and to reduce the overall amount of impervious surfaces covering the ground that allow for contaminated urban runoff. Rain gardens perform most effectively when they interact with the greater system of stormwater control. This integrated approach to water treatment is called the \\"stormwater chain\\", which consists of all associated techniques to prevent surface run-off, retain run-off for infiltration or evaporation, detain run- off and release it at a predetermined rate, and convey rainfall from where it lands to detention or retention facilities. Rain gardens have many reverberating effects on the greater hydrological system. In a bioretention system such as a rain garden, water filters through layers of soil and vegetation media, which treat the water before it enters the groundwater system or an underdrain. Any remaining runoff from a rain garden will have a lower temperature than runoff from an impervious surface, which reduces the thermal shock on receiving bodies of water. Additionally, increasing the amount of permeable surfaces by designing urban rain gardens reduces the amount of polluted stormwater that reaches natural bodies of water and recharges groundwater at a higher rate.SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry, Syracuse, New York  Bioretention  The concept of LID (low- impact design) for stormwater management is based on bioretention: a landscape and water design practice that utilizes the chemical, biological, and physical properties of soils, microorganisms, and plants to control the quality and quantity of water flow within a site. Bioretention facilities are primarily designed for water management, and can treat urban runoff, stormwater, groundwater, and in special cases, wastewater. Carefully designed constructed wetlands are necessary for the bioretention of sewage water or grey water, which have greater effects on human health than the implications of treating urban runoff and rainfall. Environmental benefits of bioretention sites include increased wildlife diversity and habitat production and minimized energy use and pollution. Prioritizing water management through natural bioretention sites eliminates the possibility of covering the land with impermeable surfaces. = Water treatment process = Bioretention controls the stormwater quantity through interception, infiltration, evaporation, and transpiration. First, rainfall is captured by plant tissue (leaves and stems) and in the soil micropores. Then, water performs infiltration - the downward movement of water through soil - and is stored in the soil until the substrate reaches its moisture capacity, when it begins to pool at the top of the bioretention feature. The pooled water and water from plant and soil surfaces is then evaporated into the atmosphere. Optimal design of bioretention sites aim for shallow pooled water to reach a higher rate of evaporation. Water also evaporates through the leaves of the plants in the feature and back to the atmosphere, which is a process known as evapotranspiration. Bioretention controls the stormwater quality through settling, filtration, assimilation, adsorption, degradation, and decomposition. When water pools on top of a bioretention feature, suspended solids and large particles will settle out. Dust particles, soil particles, and other small debris are filtered out of the water as it moves downward through the soil and interspersed plant roots. Plants take up some of the nutrients for use in their growth processes, or for mineral storage. Dissolved chemical substances from the water also bind to the surfaces of plant roots, soil particles, and other organic matter in the substrate and are rendered ineffective. Soil microorganisms break down remaining chemicals and small organic matter and effectively decompose the pollutants into a saturated soil matter. Even though natural water purification is based on the design of planted areas, the key components of bioremediation are the soil quality and microorganism activity. These features are supported by plants, which create secondary pore space to increase soil permeability, prevent soil compaction through complex root structure growth, provide habitats for the microorganisms on the surfaces of their roots, and transport oxygen to the soil. Design A recently planted home rain garden Stormwater garden design encompasses a wide range of features based on the principles of bioretention. These facilities are then organized into a sequence and incorporated into the landscape in the order that rainfall moves from buildings and permeable surfaces to gardens, and eventually, to bodies of water. A rain garden requires an area where water can collect and infiltrate, and plants can maintain infiltration rates, diverse microorganism communities, and water storage capacity. Because infiltration systems manage storm water quantity by reducing storm water runoff volumes and peak flows, rain garden design must begin with a site analysis and assessment of the rainfall loads on the proposed bioretention system. This will lead to different knowledge about each site, which will affect the choice of plantings and substrate systems. At a minimum, rain gardens should be designed for the peak runoff rate during the most severe expected storm. The load applied on the system will then determine the optimal design flow rate. Existing gardens can be adapted to perform like rain gardens by adjusting the landscape so that downspouts and paved surfaces drain into existing planting areas. Even though existing gardens have loose soil and well-established plants, they may need to be augmented in size and/or with additional, diverse plantings to support a higher infiltration capacity. Also, many plants do not tolerate saturated roots for long and will not be able to handle the increased flow of water. Rain garden plant species should be selected to match the site conditions after the required location and storage capacity of the bioretention area are determined. In addition to mitigating urban runoff, the rain garden may contribute to urban habitats for native butterflies, birds, and beneficial insects. Rain gardens are at times confused with bioswales. Swales slope to a destination, while rain gardens are level; however, a bioswale may end with a rain garden as a part of a larger stormwater management system. Drainage ditches may be handled like bioswales and even include rain gardens in series, saving time and money on maintenance. Part of a garden that nearly always has standing water is a water garden, wetland, or pond, and not a rain garden. Rain gardens also differ from retention basins, where the water will infiltrate the ground at a much slower rate, within a day or two. =Soil and drainage= Collected water is filtered through the strata of soil or engineering growing soil, called substrate. After the soil reaches its saturation limit, excess water pools on the surface of the soil and eventually infiltrates the natural soil below. The bioretention soil mixture should typically contain 60% sand, 20% compost, and 20% topsoil. Soils with higher concentrations of compost have shown improved effects on filtering groundwater and rainwater. Non-permeable soil needs to be removed and replaced periodically to generate maximum performance and efficiency if used in the bioretention system. The sandy soil (bioretention mixture) cannot be combined with a surrounding soil that has a lower sand content because the clay particles will settle in between the sand particles and form a concrete-like substance that is not conducive to infiltration, according to a 1983 study. Compact lawn soil cannot harbor groundwater nearly as well as sandy soils, because the micropores within the soil are not sufficient for retaining substantial runoff levels. When an area's soils are not permeable enough to allow water to drain and filter at an appropriate rate, the soil should be replaced and an underdrain installed. Sometimes a drywell with a series of gravel layers near the lowest spot in the rain garden will help facilitate percolation and avoid clogging at the sedimentation basin. However, a drywell placed at the lowest spot can become clogged with silt prematurely, turning the garden into an infiltration basin and defeating its purpose as a bioretention system. The more polluted the runoff water, the longer it must be retained in the soil for purification. Capacity for a longer purification period is often achieved by installing several smaller rain garden basins with soil deeper than the seasonal high water table. In some cases lined bioretention cells with subsurface drainage are used to retain smaller amounts of water and filter larger amounts without letting water percolate as quickly. A five-year study by the U.S. Geological Survey indicates that rain gardens in urban clay soils can be effective without the use of underdrains or replacement of native soils with the bioretention mix. Yet it also indicates that pre-installation infiltration rates should be at least .25 in/hour. Type D soils will require an underdrain paired with the sandy soil mix in order to drain properly.Sustainable City Network, Dubuque, IA (2011-02-21).\\"USGS: Rain Gardens Work Regardless of Soil Conditions.\\" Rain gardens are often located near a building's roof drainpipe (with or without rainwater tanks). Most rain gardens are designed to be an endpoint of a building's or urban site's drainage system with a capacity to percolate all incoming water through a series of soil or gravel layers beneath the surface plantings. A French drain may be used to direct a portion of the rainwater to an overflow location for heavier rain events. If the bioretention site has additional runoff directed from downspouts leading from the roof of a building, or if the existing soil has a filtration rate faster than 5 inches per hour, the substrate of the rain garden should include a layer of gravel or sand beneath the topsoil to meet that increased infiltration load. If not originally designed to include a rain garden onsite, downpipes from the roof can be disconnected and diverted to a rain garden for retrofit stormwater management. This reduces the amount of water load on the conventional drainage system, and instead directs water for infiltration and treatment through bioretention features. By reducing peak stormwater discharge, rain gardens extend hydraulic lag time and somewhat mimic the natural water cycle displaced by urban development and allow for groundwater recharge. While rain gardens always allow for restored groundwater recharge, and reduced stormwater volumes, they may not improve pollution unless remediation materials are included in the design of the filtration layers. =Vegetation= Typical rain garden plants are herbaceous perennials and grasses, which are chosen for their porous root structure and high growth rate. Trees and shrubs can also be planted to cover larger areas on the bioretention site. Although specific plants are selected and designed for respective soils and climates,Dussaillant et al. Journal of Hydrologic Engineering plants that can tolerate both saturated and dry soil are typically used for the rain garden. They need to be maintained for maximum efficiency, and be compatible with adjacent land uses. Native and adapted plants are commonly selected for rain gardens because they are more tolerant of the local climate, soil, and water conditions; have deep and variable root systems for enhanced water infiltration and drought tolerance; increase habitat value, diversity for local ecological communities, and overall sustainability once established. Vegetation with dense and uniform root structure depth helps to maintain consistent infiltration throughout the bioretention system. There can be trade-offs associated with using native plants, including lack of availability for some species, late spring emergence, short blooming season, and relatively slow establishment. It is important to plant a wide variety of species so the rain garden is functional during all climatic conditions. It is likely that the garden will experience a gradient of moisture levels across its functional lifespan, so some drought tolerant plantings are desirable. There are four categories of a vegetative species‚Äô moisture tolerance that can be considered when choosing plants for a rain garden. Wet soil is constantly full of water with long periods of pooling surface water; this category includes swamp and marsh sites. Moist soil is always slightly damp, and plants that thrive in this category can tolerate longer periods of flooding. Mesic soil is neither very wet nor very dry; plants that prefer this category can tolerate brief periods of flooding. Dry soil is ideal for plants that can withstand long dry periods. Plantings chosen for rain gardens must be able to thrive during both extreme wet and dry spells, since rain gardens periodically swing between these two states. A rain garden in temperate climates will unlikely dry out completely, but gardens in dry climates will need to sustain low soil moisture levels during periods of drought. On the other hand, rain gardens are unlikely to suffer from intense waterlogging, since the function of a rain garden is that excess water is drained from the site. Plants typically found in rain gardens are able to soak up large amounts of rainfall during the year as an intermediate strategy during the dry season. Transpiration by growing plants accelerates soil drying between storms. Rain gardens perform best using plants that grow in regularly moist soils, because these plants can typically survive in drier soils that are relatively fertile (contain many nutrients). Chosen vegetation needs to respect site constraints and limitations, and especially should not impede the primary function of bioretention. Trees under power lines, or that up-heave sidewalks when soils become moist, or whose roots seek out and clog drainage tiles can cause expensive damage. Trees generally contribute to bioretention sites the most when they are located close enough to tap moisture in the rain garden depression, yet do not excessively shade the garden and allow for evaporation. That said, shading open surface waters can reduce excessive heating of vegetative habitats. Plants tolerate inundation by warm water for less time than they tolerate cold water because heat drives out dissolved oxygen, thus a plant tolerant of early spring flooding may not survive summer inundation. = Pollutant Removal = Rain gardens are designed to capture the initial flow of stormwater and reduce the accumulation of toxins flowing directly into natural waterways through ground filtration. Natural remediation of contaminated stormwater is an effective, cost-free treatment process. Directing water to flow through soil and vegetation achieves particle pollutant capture, while atmospheric pollutants are captured in plant membranes and then trapped in soil, where most of them begin to break down. These approaches help to diffuse runoff, which allows contaminants to be distributed across the site instead of concentrated. The National Science Foundation, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and a number of research institutions are presently studying the impact of augmenting rain gardens with materials capable of capture or chemical reduction of the pollutants to benign compounds. The primary challenge of rain garden design is predicting the types of pollutants and the acceptable loads of pollutants the rain garden's filtration system can process during high impact storm events. Contaminants may include organic material, such as animal waste and oil spills, as well as inorganic material, such as heavy metals and fertilizer nutrients. These pollutants are known to cause harmful over-promotion of plant and algal growth if they seep into streams and rivers. The challenge of predicting pollutant loads is specifically acute when a rain event occurs after a longer dry period. The initial storm water is often highly contaminated with the accumulated pollutants from dry periods. Rain garden designers have previously focused on finding robust native plants and encouraging adequate biofiltration, but recently have begun augmenting filtration layers with media specifically suited to chemically reduce redox of incoming pollutant streams. Certain plant species are very effective at storing mineral nutrients, which are only released once the plant dies and decays. Other species can absorb heavy metal contaminants. Cutting back and entirely removing these plants at the end of the growth cycle completely removes these contaminants. This process of cleaning up polluted soils and stormwater is called phytoremediation.

By providing access to the best current guidance, easy-to-use materials, and a network of trained \\"Rain Garden Mentor\\" Master Gardeners, this campaign seeks to capture and cleanse over 200 Million gallons of polluted runoff each year, and thereby significantly improve Puget Sound's water quality. * Maplewood, Minnesota has implemented a policy of encouraging residents to install rain gardens. Many neighborhoods had swales added to each property, but installation of a garden at the swale was voluntary. The project was a partnership between the City of Maplewood, University of Minnesota Department of Landscape Architecture, and the Ramsey Washington Metro Watershed District. A focus group was held with residents and published so that other communities could use it as a resource when planning their own rain garden projects. * Some local governmental organizations offer local grants for residents to install raingardens. In Dakota County Minnesota, the Dakota County Soil and Water Conservation District offers $250 grants and technical assistance through their Landscaping for Clean Water programhttp://www.dakotaswcd.org/cleanwater_form.html to encourage residents to install residential raingardens. * In Seattle, a prototype project, used to develop a plan for the entire city, was constructed in 2003. Called SEA Street, for Street Edge Alternatives, it was a drastic facelift of a residential street. The street was changed from a typical linear path to a gentle curve, narrowed, with large rain gardens placed along most of the length of the street. The street has 11% less impervious surface than a regular street. There are 100 evergreen trees and 1100 shrubs along this 3-block stretch of road, and a 2-year study found that the amount of stormwater which leaves the street has been reduced by 99%.City of Seattle, Washington.

Davis is an environment and civil engineering professor at the University of Maryland, College Park. For the past 20 years, Davis and his team have been studying the effectiveness of rain gardens. For their research, they constructed two rain gardens on campus near the Anacostia River watershed in the Fall of 2001. Much of the runoff from the University of Maryland campus, a member of the Anacostia Watershed Restoration Partnership, ends up in the Anacostia River feeding into the Chesapeake Bay. This research finds rain gardens to be a very effective method of water capture and filtration, encouraging others in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed to implement rain gardens. ** Davis' research showed that rain gardens aid in the capturing and bio-degradation of pollutants such as suspended solids, bacteria, metals, oil, and grease. ** Water quality analyzed at the University of Maryland showed a significant increase in water clarity after rain garden filtration. ** There is a rain garden at the Center for Young Children (CYC) at University of Maryland designed by students from the Department of Plant Science and Landscape Agriculture. The rain garden allows teachers at the CYC to educate future students on sustainability. = China = * At the University of Technology in Xi'an China, a rain garden was built to observe and study over 4 years. This study showed that over 4 years, there were 28 large storm events in Xi'an. Within these 28 storms, the rain garden was able to retain the rainfall from a majority of the storms. Only 5 of these storms caused the rain garden to overflow. * Rain Gardens in this sub-humid loess region of Xi'an China, are Low Impact Developments (LID). * China's plans to implement the \\"sponge city\\" program is in response to its urban flooding.

Map showing Bead Hill or Ganatsekwyagon, and the Rouge Trail to Lake Simcoe, ca. 1673 by Louis Jolliet. Water from glaciers melting 12,000 years ago formed ancestral Lake Ontario, which covered this entire area. A large ice lobe, roughly 20 metres thick, blocked the lake from draining eastward, leaving water levels high as the lake slowly drained south to what is now the Mississippi River. The ice lobe finally retreated, draining the lake to the St Lawrence River and forming the Great Lakes as we see them today. Glaciation occurred when average annual temperatures were only 2 - 5 ¬∞C lower than present. The small decrease to the former temperatures caused big changes to the landscape. Changes in average annual temperatures now may seem small, but they could cause major changes to the natural environment in the near future. Outcrops of rock formed during the last glacial period found in Rouge National Urban Park are important to geologists studying seismic activity, in particular the risk of earthquakes in the GTA. Faults are visible indicating significant earthquake activity between 80,000 and 13,000 years ago. The human history of Rouge National Urban Park goes back over 10,000 years. Palaeolithic nomadic hunters, Iroquoian farmers, early European explorers, and the multicultural suburban population that one can see around the park today are all part of this history. Since humans began living in the area of the present Great Lakes-St Lawrence Lowlands in Ontario, many groups of people made the lands and waters now protected in Rouge Park their home. The river and its valleys, uplands, forests and wetlands, along with the animal and plant species that lived here, sustained small nomadic groups, and later on larger, permanent settlements long before the rapid urbanization of the 20th century altered the landscape dramatically. Inspired by the scenery of the Rouge, F.H. Varley, one of the renowned Group of Seven painters, captured the banks of the Rouge River in Markham on canvas during the 1950s as a lasting memory of their beauty. Toronto Carrying-Place Trail National Historic Event This was an original portage route along the Rouge River to the Holland River, linking Lake Ontario to Lake Simcoe.See also the Aurora Huron Ancestral Village in Whitchurch-Stouffville. This route was created by Indigenous Peoples, and later used by early European traders, explorers and settlers. The Rouge River route is not currently marked by a federal historical marker, but the western branch of the route, following the Humber River, has one acknowledging both forks of the route. The Toronto Carrying-Place Trail was designated a National Historic Event on the advice of the national Historic Sites and Monuments Board in 1969.

The original Rouge Park was established in 1995 by the Province of Ontario in partnership with cities of Toronto, Markham and Pickering and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority. The original park consisted of approximately 40 square kilometres of parkland in Toronto, Markham and Pickering. Parks Canada first committed to work towards the creation of Rouge National Urban Park in 2011, following a review of the former regional Rouge Park's governance, organization and finance, which recommended the creation of a national urban park. In laying the groundwork for the park's establishment, Parks Canada has consulted and collaborated with over 20,000 Canadians and 200 organizations, including Indigenous People, all levels of government, community groups, conservationists, farmers and residents. The most well-known part of the original Rouge Park, near the Toronto Zoo and Rouge Beach areas, remain open and are managed on an interim basis by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority in partnership with Parks Canada and municipalities. As Rouge National Urban Park becomes fully operational, former Rouge Park lands will transfer to Parks Canada and become part of the much larger (79.1 km2) Rouge National Urban Park. Most remaining 'Rouge Park' lands were expected to transfer to Parks Canada in 2017. Once fully established, Rouge National Urban Park will be the largest urban protected area in North America. It stretches from Lake Ontario in the south, north to the post-glacial Oak Ridges Moraine in the north. April 1, 2015, Transport Canada transferred the first lands that would make up Rouge National Urban Park to Parks Canada - 19.1 km2 in the north end of the park in the City of Markham. On May 15, 2015 the Rouge National Urban Park Act came into force, formally establishing Rouge National Urban Park. The park is open with free admission to visitors 365 days per year, though there are camping fees. There are currently over 12 kilometres of rustic hiking trails in the Toronto and Markham areas of the park, though Parks Canada has plans to significantly expand the trail network and provide a contiguous link from Lake Ontario to the Oak Ridges Moraine. In Toronto, the park is accessible by public transportation by TTC and GO Transit. The role of civil society within conservation efforts of a green space was enhanced through expertise and science which allowed legalizing the civil society claims to the public. The civil society came up with their own expertise to validate their ecologically based arguments that could also stand up to competing alternative positions. The ecological restoration or monitoring programs that the civil society was involved in was a stride towards a booming long-term movement. Initiatives The Rouge River and valley, seen from Finch Meander Trail. A number of projects and initiatives are underway as part of the Rouge National Urban Park establishment process. The Beare Road Park Master Plan was proposed in 2013. It advocates for the closed Beare Road Landfill area to be turned into a park called Beare Hill Park that is integrated into the Rouge National Urban Park. The Beare Road Landfill closed in 1983 and has since been partly reforested and converted into a wetland. It is currently surrounded by the park to the west, north and east. There is an official trail in the Rouge National Urban Park where the hill can be viewed from but it does not allow access to the landfill area. Dirt trails to the hill have been created by patrons of the park who wish to gain a better view of Eastern Greater Toronto as it is one of the tallest points in the area. There is no solid barrier between the park and the landfill which allows animals and park patrons alike to traverse through the space, believing it to part of the park. The wetlands at the site are significant for many species such as bobolink, milk snakes and the Blanding's Turtle (a threatened species in Ontario) so Rouge Park conservation authorities work often in the area. On June 27, 2017 The City of Toronto held a meeting to discuss the progress of the Beare Hill Park and confirmed its integration into the greater Rouge National Urban Park. Work on the area has begun and it is predicted that the site will be open for the public in 2019. Plans for the site focus on trails for recreation, an observation deck and a focus on educating the public about how closed landfills are managed and rehabilitated. Parks Canada is working with 10 different First Nations with historic and present-day connections to the park through the Rouge National Urban Park First Nations Advisory Circle. Parks Canada's Indigenous partners play a role in and make significant contributions to all aspects of park operations, including helping to restore and enhance park ecosystems and farmland, sharing traditional stories and cuisine at in-park programs and events, and participating in and helping to monitor archaeological work throughout the park. In 2016, Parks Canada offered over 300 free public events in the park, including Frog Watch, Hoot and Howl, weekly guided walks, Art in the Park, the Fall Walk Festival, BioBlitz, Learn- to-Camp, Taste of the Trail and more. Several education and orientation centres, facilities, signage and interpretive panels are being planned in the Toronto and Markham areas of the park. Parks Canada is planning to significantly expand the park's trail network from 12 kilometres by adding dozens of kilometres of new trails in effort to provide a contiguous connection from Lake Ontario to Oak Ridges Moraine. Plans are also underway to link park trails with regional trails outside the park located in the cities of Toronto, Markham and Pickering and in the Township of Uxbridge. In 2016, Parks Canada partnered with OCAD University to hire the park's first ‚ÄúPhotographer-in-Residence‚Äù Heike Reuse. Heike's work was featured in the Toronto Star, CBC and Metro, and she also staged an exhibition in downtown Toronto.  Technology  = The Rouge App = Beginning in 2016, students from the University of Toronto Scarborough (The Arts & Science Co-op and Masters of Environmental Science Departments) and the Hub (the University's center for entrepreneurship) have worked in collaboration with Parks Canada to release the Rouge App, an application designed to provide park visitors with an interactive and informative guide in the palm of their hand. Information was collected from Parks Canada staff, indigenous communities, locals, scientists and historians for content. Features include: trail and landscape information, landmarks, cultural and historical information, GPS distance tracker, safety information on poisonous flora and fauna, a memory game for children, rewards for hiked distances, as well as an option to report issues. The app was launched on October 21, 2017 and is available on both IOS and Android phones in English, French and Simplified Chinese. = INaturalist = Parks Canada has a partnership with INaturalist, an online platform (and App) where people can upload observations of plant, insect and animal life in their area and contribute to citizen science. Through their partnership, they host BioBlitz events in their National Parks. Bioblitz are day (or multiday) events where visitors can interact with scientists and community members to find specific species of plants, insects or animals. Through June 24 and 25 of 2017, the Rouge National Urban Park hosted a Bioblitz event, the first since being recognized as a National Park. Participants were found to have recorded 43 different mammalian species on the INaturalist site =GIS and Spatial Analysis= Two of the tools that are being used to further the sustainability agenda are the use of GIS as a mapping tool for the park and spatial analysis techniques. The TRCA (Toronto and Region Conservation Authority) has a collection of thematic layers containing information about the watersheds that can be linked together by geography. These layers are used for decision-making support and solutions to ecological restoration, property acquisition, fisheries management, planning and floodplain mapping. The TRCA and the City of Toronto have a georeferenced digital ortho-photo dataset of the GTA at a resolution of 0.5 meters, which is the most accurate and comprehensive digital data for the GTA. This ortho-photo is used by TRCA biologists and the City of Toronto Natural Heritage Study to identify and digitize natural habitats and then analyze that data in relation to surrounding land uses, habitat patch size and shape. GIS was also used as a tool to ecologically assess the master plan for the Rouge Park Trails. A sensitivity analysis was done for the park, which involved plotting the location of rare plant and animal species, identifying wetlands and other sensitive habitats, and important nesting and breeding areas for wildlife. The mapping process involved the use of geo- referenced ecological data from sources like MNR, TRCA and Rouge Park to be mapped onto digital aerial photos of Rouge Park so that specific locations of sensitive species and habitats could be determined. The data that was mapped includes flora and fauna occurrences, provincially and locally significant wetlands, vegetation communities, Environmentally significant areas (ESAs) and interior forest habitat. The David Suzuki Foundation has also used GIS and spatial analysis to map the value of natural capital in the Rouge National Park. The foundation mapped the distribution of land cover and land use in the Rouge Park and the surrounding watersheds, as well as the average ecosystem service value per hectare by land cover type. The data was from the 2000-2002 Southern Ontario Land Resource Information System (SOLRIS). Biodiversity and wildlife White Tailed Deer at the Rouge National Urban Park, one of over 1,700 species of plants, animals, and fungi located within the Park. This urban park features numerous fauna such as white-tailed deer, mice, opossums, raccoons, hawks, coyotes, skunks, ducks, beaver, bald eagles, shrews, red foxes, turkeys, weasels, golden eagles, river otters, kestrels, moles, swans, minks, bats, woodchucks, and porcupines. The park has over 1,700 species of plants, animals and fungi, as verified in the 2012 and 2013 Ontario BioBlitz surveys. * 1006 plant species, including 6 which are nationally rare and 92 which are regionally rare. * 261 bird species, 5 of which are nationally rare breeding birds and 4 other breeding birds of special concern as well as numerous locally rare, area-sensitive raptor and colonial birds * 65 fish species, 2 of which are nationally vulnerable * 40 mammal species, some are locally rare * 21 reptile and amphibian species, some are locally rare Physical geography Rouge Beach Pond at Rouge National Urban Park. The pond is located at the mouth of the river. Rouge National Urban Park is located in the Rouge River, Petticoat Creek and Duffins Creek watersheds. The Rouge River remains the healthiest river that flows through the City of Toronto. The ravine system that surrounds the Rouge River forms a part of the larger Toronto ravine system; which also includes the ravines surrounding the other rivers and creeks in the city. =Artificial wetlands= The created wetlands within the Rouge Park watershed serve ecological benefits like providing a reduction in flood force, a reduction in extreme nutrient amount as well as being a crucial habitat for organisms that are semi-aquatic. However, a problem has been shown to occur amongst the created wetlands in regard to the potential they have for producing methyl mercury (MeHg). After the water, sediment and the invertebrates from the wetlands were sampled, it was determined that the MeHg concentrations decrease with an increase in the wetland age with the net production of MeHg being especially high in newly created wetlands. The proof of understanding behind these results has come from the fact that in younger wetlands the iron-reducing bacteria maybe adding a methane group to the inorganic mercury causing increase in production of MeHg. On the other hand, the organic matter that gets accumulated in the aged wetlands has the ability to bind inorganic mercury so that bacterial methylation is not able to take place.Sinclair, K. A., Xie, Q., & Mitchell, C. P. (December 2012). Methylmercury in water, sediment, and invertebrates in created wetlands of Rouge Park, Toronto, Canada. Environmental Pollution(171), 2017-215. =Farmland= People have been farming in the Rouge Valley for thousands of years, including Indigenous People and, later, European settlers. Rouge National Urban Park protects large tracts of Class 1 farmland, the rarest and most fertile soil in Canada. Since 2015, Parks Canada has partnered with park farmers, Indigenous partners, and conservation groups to complete 31 conservation and agricultural enhancements projects in Rouge National Urban Park. To date, more than 32 hectares of wetland and riparian habitat and 20 hectares of forest have been restored, and over 38,000 native trees and shrubs have been planted. Parks Canada has committed to preserving the park's farmland and working farms in a way that contributes to the overall health of the park while also providing unique visitor farm experiences. The park is home to two well known farmers markets, Whittamore's Farm (closed 2017) and Reesor's Farm Market. Conservation Friends of the Rouge Watershed is a non-profit, community-based environmental protection and conservation organization that aims to protect and restore the Rouge Watershed located in Scarborough, Ontario. They also contribute to the ecosystems within the watershed by creating habitat structures like raptor posts for owls and hawks to perch onto, which will regulate rodent populations. The Rouge National Urban Park Act, also called the Bill C-40, is a tailor-made approach for protecting the Rouge. It complements Ontario's Greenbelt Act and goes further by obligating the Government of Canada to protect the park, and its ecosystems, cultural artifacts, and native wildlife. The act also proposes wardens who will look after the park and patrol all year long. Wardens will be working closely with the local police to protect the visitors and the resources. The policy also focuses on restoring native ecosystems and wildlife landscape. Since 2014, Parks Canada has worked with the Toronto Zoo to rear and release 113 baby Blanding's turtles in the park; a threatened species, prior to this initiative, it was believed that only seven turtles remained in the park. Beginning in 2015, Parks Canada began to partner with park farmers and the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority to complete conservation and agricultural enhancements projects in Rouge National Urban Park. Urban pollution The Rouge park consists of acres of protected land right in the middle of a metropolitan area. It is home to various unique wildlife species that are otherwise at risk. The location of the park makes it vulnerable to many different sources of pollution. For example, one of Toronto's major highway cuts right through the park. To provide a safe and recreational environment for visitors and maintain biodiversity, it is important to identify these sources and better manage the risks. Different types of pollution sources found in the rouge park are listed below, and the risk associated with them. Sources of urban pollution found in the Rouge Park include: Many decades of urban development have led to increased erosion and channel instability. Erosion can cause sediment loading in streams and impact aquatic life. Eroded sediments can carry nutrients and other substances that can naturally build up in the soil, typical land development practices of an urban area have led to large concession blocks of soils being exposed at a given time.TRCA (2007, November). Rouge River- State of the Watershed Report. Retrieved from http://www.trca.on.ca/dotAsset/37751.pdf Much of the wetland in the park was drained and cleared to make room for agriculture. Farms are significant contributors to contaminants such as nutrients, bacteria's and pesticides getting into a river. In the Rouge park the median concentrations of phosphorus range from 0.02 mg/L in the Little Rouge River to 0.05 mg/L in the Main Rouge, south of Highway 7 (provincial guideline is 0.03 mg/L). Angus Glen is one of several golf courses located near the Rouge watershed. Maintenance for these courses typically threaten the river's health, although surrounding courses have taken measures to minimize it. 24 golf courses can be found located in the watershed, which can be a significant source of pesticides and nutrients. Golf course turfs also require a significant amount of irrigation which can threaten stream health. However, the surrounding golf course have undertaken proactive measures to fit environmental standards. In the Rouge watershed, there are six abandoned landfills, this poses a risk of leachates leaking through the sides of the landfill. it is important to continuously monitor these sites and prevent contamination. A study summarizing spills in the rouge park was conducted recently. From the data, we found that between 1988-2000, there were roughly 300 oil spills and 90 chemical spills. Most of these occurred on the road or from commercial plants, storage facilities, and tanker trucks. A recent spill in the Little Rouge River resulted in the killing of fish up to 4 km downstream of the spill. Typically, in an urban area, we can expect much of the soil to be impermeable due to asphalt & concrete. This means when excessive rainfall hits, it picks up pollutants and rapidly runs off. In 1970, a heavy thunderstorm hit Malvern and at the mouth of the Malvern outfalls, the Morningside stream was choked with pollutants such as oil, rubber, plastics and heavy metals from driveways, roads and parking lots. Further downstream, a breeding area for salmon and trout was negatively affected due to harm from flash floods and pollution.Correcting Stormwater Mistakes. (n.d.). Retrieved October 22, 2017, from http://www.frw.ca/rouge.php?ID=34 During the storm, runoff can pick up road salt which can cause contamination of groundwater and leaching out of trace metals.Marselek, J. (2003). Road salts in urban stormwater: an emerging issue in stormwater management in cold climates. Water Science & Technology, 48(9), 61-70 A multi-lane highway and railway tracks cuts through the park, and with it brings negative environmental impact.

Retrieved October 22, 2017, from http://www.frw.ca/rouge.php?ID=29 During winter, roads are covered in salts, which is an added contaminant in the watershed. The streams found in the Rouge Park have shown an overall increase in the levels of chloride found. Noise created by the highway can also impact acoustic ecology (soundscaping).

Signs and symptoms Signs of meningeoncephalitis include unusual behavior, personality changes, and thinking problems. Symptoms may include headache, fever, pain in neck movement, light sensitivity, and seizure. Causes Causative organisms include protozoans, viral and bacterial pathogens. Specific types include: =Bacterial= Veterinarians have observed meningoencephalitis in animals infected with listeriosis, caused by the pathogenic bacteria L. monocytogenes. Meningitis and encephalitis already present in the brain or spinal cord of an animal may form simultaneously into meningeoencephalitis. The bacterium commonly targets the sensitive structures of the brain stem. L. monocytogenes meningoencephalitis has been documented to significantly increase the number of cytokines, such as IL-1Œ≤, IL-12, IL-15, leading to toxic effects on the brain. Meningoencephalitis may be one of the severe complications of diseases originating from several Rickettsia species, such as Rickettsia rickettsii (agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF)), Rickettsia conorii, Rickettsia prowazekii (agent of epidemic louse-borne typhus), and Rickettsia africae. It can cause impairments to the cranial nerves, paralysis to the eyes, and sudden hearing loss. Meningoencephalitis is a rare, late-stage manifestation of tick-borne ricksettial diseases, such as RMSF and Human monocytotropic ehrlichiosis (HME), caused by Ehrlichia chaffeensis (a species of rickettsiales bacteria).

One common interpretation of capacity management is described in the ITIL framework. ITIL version 3 views capacity management as comprising three sub-processes: business capacity management, service capacity management, and component capacity management (known as resource capacity management in ITIL version 2). As the usage of IT services change and functionality evolves, the amount of central processing units (CPUs), memory and storage to a physical or virtual server etc. also changes. If it is possible to understand the demands being made currently, and how they will change over time, this approach proposes that capacity planning for IT service growth becomes easier and less reactive. If there are spikes in, for example, processing power at a particular time of the day, it proposes analyzing what is happening at that time and make changes to maximize the existing IT infrastructure, for example, tune the application, or move a batch cycle to a quieter period. This foresight from proactive capacity planning identifies: any potential capacity related issues likely to arise and justifies any necessary investment decisions to the business and IT stakeholders i.e. the precise server requirements to accommodate a future growth in IT resource demand, a technology refresh or a data center consolidation. These activities are intended to optimize performance and efficiency, and to plan for and justify financial investments. Capacity management is concerned with: * Monitoring the performance and throughput or load on a server, server farm, or property * Performance analysis of measurement data, including analysis of the impact of new releases on capacity * Performance tuning of activities to ensure the most efficient use of existing infrastructure * Understanding the demands on the service and future plans for workload growth (or shrinkage) * Influences on demand for computing resources * Capacity planning of storage, computer hardware, software and connection infrastructure resources required over some future period of time. Capacity management interacts with the discipline of Performance Engineering, both during the requirements and design activities of building a system, and when using performance monitoring as an input for managing capacity of deployed systems.  Factors affecting network performance  Not all networks are the same. As data is broken into component parts (often known frames, packets, or segments) for transmission, several factors can affect their delivery. *Delay: It can take a long time for a packet to be delivered across intervening networks. In reliable protocols where a receiver acknowledges delivery of each chunk of data, it is possible to measure this as round-trip time. *Packet loss: In some cases, intermediate devices in a network will lose packets. This may be due to errors, to overloading of the intermediate network, or to the intentional discarding of traffic in order to enforce a particular service level. *Retransmission: When packets are lost in a reliable network, they are retransmitted. This incurs two delays: First, the delay from re-sending the data; and second, the delay resulting from waiting until the data is received in the correct order before forwarding it up the protocol stack. *Throughput: The amount of traffic a network can carry is measured as throughput, usually in terms such as kilobits per second. Throughput is analogous to the number of lanes on a highway, whereas latency is analogous to its speed limit. These factors, and others (such as the performance of the network signaling on the end nodes, compression, encryption, concurrency, and so on) all affect the effective performance of a network. In some cases, the network may not work at all; in others, it may be slow or unusable. And because applications run over these networks, application performance suffers. Various intelligent solutions are available to ensure that traffic over the network is effectively managed to optimize performance for all users. See Traffic Shaping  The performance management discipline  Network performance management consists of measuring, modeling, planning, and optimizing networks to ensure that they carry traffic with the speed, reliability, and capacity that is appropriate for the nature of the application and the cost constraints of the organization. Different applications warrant different blends of capacity, latency, and reliability. For example: *Streaming video or voice can be unreliable (brief moments of static) but needs to have very low latency so that lags don't occur *Bulk file transfer or e-mail must be reliable and have high capacity, but doesn't need to be instantaneous *Instant messaging doesn't consume much bandwidth, but should be fast and reliable  Network performance management tasks and classes of tools  Network Performance management is a core component of the FCAPS ISO telecommunications framework (the 'P' stands for Performance in this acronym). It enables the network engineers to proactively prepare for degradations in their IT infrastructure and ultimately help the end-user experience. Network managers perform many tasks; these include performance measurement, forensic analysis, capacity planning, and load-testing or load generation. They also work closely with application developers and IT departments who rely on them to deliver underlying network services. *For performance measurement, operators typically measure the performance of their networks at different levels. They either use per-port metrics (how much traffic on port 80 flowed between a client and a server and how long did it take) or they rely on end-user metrics (how fast did the login page load for Bob.) **Per-port metrics are collected using flow-based monitoring and protocols such as NetFlow (now standardized as IPFIX) or RMON. **End-user metrics are collected through web logs, synthetic monitoring, or real user monitoring. An example is ART (application response time) which provides end to end statistics that measure Quality of Experience. *For forensic analysis, operators often rely on sniffers that break down the transactions by their protocols and can locate problems such as retransmissions or protocol negotiations. *For capacity planning, modeling tools such as Aria Networks, OPNET, PacketTrap, NetSim, NetFlow and sFlow Analyzer, or NetQoS that project the impact of new applications or increased usage are invaluable. According to Gartner, through 2018 more than 30% of enterprises will use capacity management tools for their critical IT infrastructures, up from less than 5% in 2014. These capacity management tools help infrastructure and operations management teams plan and optimize IT infrastructures and tools, and balance the use of external and cloud computing service providers. *For load generation that helps to understand the breaking point, operators may use software or appliances that generate scripted traffic. Some hosted service providers also offer pay-as-you-go traffic generation for sites that face the public Internet.

Millward is now the assistant coach of St George Illawarra in the NRL Millward is the former head coach of Wigan, St. Helens, Leigh and Castleford. He was in charge at Wigan from May 2005, his appointment coming just two weeks after an acrimonious departure from the club's fiercest rivals, St Helens. He was sacked by Wigan on 11 April 2006 for their poor start to 2006's Super League XI season - having won just one of eight league games. In October 2006 he returned to Australia. Millward lasted one and a half seasons at Castleford before leaving half-way through the 2013 season. Biography Millward was born in Wollongong, New South Wales, and played rugby league for Illawarra Steelers lower grades in his youth, after impressing for the state's schoolboys team. His hopes of a successful playing career were ended when he was forced to retire in 1983 after suffering a serious neck injury. He turned to coaching, taking up a position with Illawarra Western Suburbs. He also had spells with Wollongong University. In 1997, he was coach of the Steelers reserve grade team, as well as an assistant coach with the first grade Illawarra Steelers side. His first senior appointment came in 1998 when he took charge of struggling English side Leigh, who had then come close to relegation to the game's third tier. He soon transformed Leigh from relegation candidates to promotion contenders, catching the eye of a number of Super League clubs in the process. He moved to St Helens in March 2000 after the sacking of Ellery Hanley. Having won the 1999 Championship, St Helens under Millward contested in the 2000 World Club Challenge against National Rugby League Premiers the Melbourne Storm and lost. Under Millward, St Helens reached the 2000 Super League Grand Final and defeated Wigan Warriors, retaining their title. He took St Helens to the 2002 Super League Grand Final which they won against the Bradford Bulls. They also won the Rugby League Challenge Cup in 2001 and 2004 and the World Club Challenge in 2001. In 2001 Millward was named Super League Coach of the Year. His time there was not without controversy, however. His decision to field an under-strength side due, he said, to injuries in a Super League match against Bradford, just a week before the Challenge Cup Final backfired badly. The move incurred the wrath of the game's authorities and St Helens were beaten in the final by Wigan, when all the injured players returned. He repeated the trick in another match against Bradford over Easter 2004, claiming a heavy fixture burden had taken its toll. St Helens were well beaten in the game at Odsal Stadium and the fall-out overshadowed the rest of the club's season. It later emerged that two St Helens players, Sean Long and Martin Gleeson, had bet on their side to lose before the team was announced. Both were later banned and the Rugby Football League (RFL) tightened up rules by insisting squads had to be named 72 hours in advance. Millward's St Helens career also ended controversially after he was suspended pending a disciplinary hearing in May 2005. He was sacked for gross misconduct a week later, his offences including three incidences of foul and abusive language: to a club employee; Warrington's press officer; and a fourth official at a match against Bradford. St Helens also claimed that Millward lied to an RFL disciplinary hearing and distorted the truth about the club's sale of Gleeson to Warrington in 2004. Within a fortnight, Millward was at Wigan Warriors as head coach above Denis Betts. He had a difficult start with Wigan, losing a Super League match 70-0 to Leeds Rhinos and, more humiliatingly, a Challenge Cup tie at St Helens 75-0. Wigan ended the season seventh in the Super League, missing out on the play-offs for the first time in the competition and club's history. After a disastrous start to the 2006 Super League, Millward was relieved of his duties as head coach of Wigan on 11 April 2006. During this time, a combination of poor performances and injuries to key players had seen Wigan slump to bottom of the engage Super League. Wigan had won just one of eight league games. The club issued this statement: \\"Following a meeting of the board of directors the Wigan club can confirm that head coach Ian Millward has been dismissed with immediate effect. Ian will be leaving the club and team affairs will be managed in the short term by the assistant coaches Stuart Wilkinson and Andrew Farrar.\\" He was replaced the following week by then Bradford Bulls coach, Brian Noble. Millward enjoyed some time away from rugby league after being sacked by Wigan but later in 2006 he returned to the club where he started his English coaching career to become coaching co-ordinator at National League One side Leigh Centurions. Millward also worked as a co- presenter on rugby league matches shown on Sky Sports or BBC. In 2007 Millward was appointed the assistant coach at National Rugby League side North Queensland Cowboys. After Graham Murray resigned in May 2008, Millward took over as a head coach for the remainder of the season. Millward was appointed as assistant coach to David Furner at the Canberra Raiders on a two-year contract from 2009. On 30 June 2009 it was announced that Millward would be re-joining Championship side Leigh Centurions in England from 2010. Millward signed a three-year contract after Canberra agreed to release Millward from his contract. He took over from Terry Matterson as the coach of Castleford starting for the 2012 season he has signed a 3-year deal to stay with the club. Millward was released by Castleford Tigers by mutual consent on 9 April 2013 after a very poor run of just one win in 18 games and with the team at the bottom of the Super League table at the time. In 2014, Millward returned to Australia to coach the Illawarra Cutters NSW Cup team, replacing former Steelers centre Paul McGregor as coach. In 2015 he became assistant coach of the St George illawarra dragons to assist new coach Paul McGregor Millward has worked as a TV pundit for the Super League Show broadcast on the BBC and also has featured as a summariser at televised games.

The regiment's motto (or cry) was Faugh a Ballagh (Clear the Way!)  Recruitment and training  The 28th was raised in Boston and received its initial training at Camp Cameron in Cambridge and Somerville. The unit underwent additional training at Fort Columbus in New York Harbor before being dispatched in early 1862 for its first active duty assignment.  Service in the war  After serving briefly under Gen. Benjamin Butler in the Carolinas and with the 9th Corps during the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia's first campaign into the North, the 28th Massachusetts was assigned to the II Corps as the fourth regiment of the famed Irish Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher. By April 1862 the 28th was at Daufuskie Island in South Carolina. A number of companies were sent to Tybee Island, Georgia to set artillery positions. Twenty-two died of malaria and other illness. The regiment came under heavy musket and artillery fire during the Second Battle of Bull Run. Col. Richard Byrnes Known for their distinctive Tiffany-embroidered green flag and Gaelic war cry, \\"Faugh a Ballagh\\" (Clear the Way), the Irishmen of the 28th Massachusetts saw action in most of the Union Army's major eastern theatre engagements ‚Äì Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Overland Campaign, and the siege of Petersburg ‚Äì and were present for Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House. Upon completion of their original three-year term of service, many of the 28th's veteran soldiers elected to return to Massachusetts. But a sufficient number re-enlisted by January 1, 1864, to justify the continuation of the regiment as a five-company battalion of \\"veteran volunteers\\" until the end of the war. During the Second Battle of Bull Run, Lt. Col. George W. Cartwright was severely wounded, placing Captain Andrew P. Caraher, commander of Company A, in command of the regiment during the Maryland Campaign. Following the Battle of Antietam, however, command of the 28th Massachusetts was given on October 18 to Col. Richard Byrnes, who although himself Irish, had been a regular officer and a 1st lieutenant in the 5th U.S. Cavalry. Although resented and protested by the other officers of the regiment, Byrnes served with distinction and was wounded on June 3, 1864, while leading the Irish Brigade at the Battle of Cold Harbor. He died nine days later. At Fredericksburg, the regiment was put in the middle of the Irish Brigade and led the charge, as they were the only regiment of the brigade that had the distinctive green flag, and since their commander wanted to make it clear to the confederates that they were facing the Irish Brigade, the 28th was planted in the middle. Stage actor Lawrence Barrett served as captain of the regiment's Company B, but served for less than a year, resigning in August 1862. Father Lawrence Stephen McMahon was a curate at Holy Cross Church, Boston and served as chaplain from 1863 to 1865. He later became Bishop of the Diocese of Hartford.  Casualties and mustering out  Among all Union regiments, the 28th Massachusetts ranked seventh in total losses. Roughly one- quarter of the 1,746 men who served in the unit were killed, died of wounds or disease, taken prisoner, or reported missing. The surviving veterans of the regiment marched in Washington, D.C., during the Grand Review of the Armies that celebrated the war's conclusion, then traveled home to Massachusetts, where they were paid and discharged from the service at Readville in June 1865.

It is classified as a membranophone. The heads are made of sheep or goat skin and the frame is made of honne or mango tree wood. The instrument is used mostly in theatrical dances with religious or mythological themes. It is carried by means of a belt or harness and struck with the hand or a short stick. It is loud, low pitched and not particularly tonal.  Origins  Hindu mythology traces the origin of the Dollu to the divine couple Shiva and Parvathi. To pass time, Shiva and Parvathi played games and laid a bet. Whichever one of them lost the bet was to leave Kailasa to live anonymously on Bhuloka (Earth). Shiva lost the bet and moved into a cave, taking the form of a stone. Mayamurthi, Shiva's ardent loyalist, guarded the cave. Over time Parvathi became fed up of managing the universe and decided to send Vayu in search of Shiva, but it was in vain. Narada located the cave, killed Mayamurthi and forced 'Shiva' to return to Kailasa. Shiva, unwilling to leave behind the dead body of his trusted and beloved guard, made a Dollu out of the dead body and carried it to Kailasa. For the reasons of its origins, the Dollu is a popular instrument among Shaivites.

Established in 1949, they helped found the People's Union ( or VU) in 1954, a Belgian political party. The links between the extremist VMO and the VU lessened as the party moved towards the centre. In later decades the VMO would become linked to neo-Nazism and a series of paramilitary attacks on immigrants and leftists before disappearing by the late 1980s.  Foundation and early years  In the years following the end of World War II, Flemish nationalists often fell victim in anti-Nazi rallies, manifestations and riots because of their anti-Belgicism and because the entire Flemish movement was discredited by military, political and economic collaboration with the Germans during World War II.Cas Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester University Press, 2000, pp. 82-83 The only outlets for organised Flemish nationalism were charitable groups dedicated to war veteran care or the Christian People's Party which, whilst not avowedly nationalist, did have a significant separatist wing.Mudde, Ideology of the Extreme Right, p. 83 The VMO was founded in 1949 by Bob Maes; it was part of a wave of Flemish nationalist groups that emerged that year, including (VC). VMO was in fact initially established as a steward group for the VC.Paul Hainsworth, The Extreme Right in Europe and the USA, Pinter, 1992, p. 131 The group sought the creation of an independent Flanders. Soon, the VMO started expanding and turned into a full-scale paramilitary organization. Between 1950 and 1970 it was heavily criticized by, but nevertheless tolerated by, the Belgian Department of Justice. On 14 December 1953, however, 16 individual VMO members were convicted for the possession of forbidden weapons earlier that year. The VMO itself was not convicted (since it was impossible at that time to prosecute a group on penal grounds, only individuals).Hugo Gijsels, Le Vlaams Block, Editions Luc Pire, p. 124, 1993 In 1954 the VMO became associated with the Christian Flemish People's Union and the more formal alliance of the VU that followed this group that same year. The VMO soon took over much of the propaganda and stewarding work for the VU although relations between the two groups became increasingly strained as the VU moved further towards a centrist position and the VMO hardened its rightist attitudes.Mudde, Ideology of the Extreme Right, p. 84 A formal schism between the two organisations was announced in October 1963.  First trial  On 14 June 1970, a trial against the VMO was initiated after violent clashes with supporters of the Democratic Front of Francophones at a rally, leaving one man dead, who suffered a heart attack, and several other severely injured. The VMO chairman Bob Maes decided to disband the VMO to protect the members from further prosecution. Soon after this, Maes was elected senator for the Volksunie and started defending more moderate points of view.  The new VMO  Numerous members of the disbanded VMO did not support Maes' decision, and reconstituted the VMO on 12 June 1971 as \\"Vlaamse Militanten Orde\\", referring to the \\"Dinaso Militanten Orde\\". Several Flemish extremists, radicals, neo-fascists and racists were among the founding members, including the former Hitler Youth member Bert Eriksson, who emerged as leader of the new group. It undertook drilling exercises and paramilitary \\"fieldgames\\" and also co-operated with similar militia groups such as the Wehrsportsgruppe, exchanging members for drilling exercises.Paul Wilkinson, The New Fascists, Pan Books, 1983, pp. 126-127 In 1974 it announced that it ended to take on an active role against leftists as well as its pro- Flemish independence agenda. When the far right Vlaams Blok was established in 1979, several VMO members also joined that party.Mudde, Ideology of the Extreme Right, p. 87 Chief among these was Xavier Buisseret, who served as propaganda chief of the Vlaams Blok, having previously held high office in the VMO.Martin A. Lee, The Beast Reawakens, Warner Books, 1997, p. 366 The new VMO became associated with a series of attacks on immigrants, Walloons and leftists as well as the organisation of annual international neo-Nazi rallies at Diksmuide, where representatives of the League of Saint George and the National States' Rights Party were amongst those in attendance.Ray Hill & Andrew Bell, The Other Face of Terror, London: Grafton, 1988, pp. 165-166 These rallies had initially been for Flemish only but in the late 1960s the VMO began to invite other rightist groups to participate and they eventually became an important annual event in the international neo-Nazi calendar.Lee, The Beast Reawakens, p. 192 Especially close to the League of Saint George, the two groups were part of a wider network that also included the Deutsche B√ºrgerinitiative in Germany, the NSDAP/AO in the United States and France's F√©d√©ration d'action nationale et europ√©enne.Wilkinson, The New Fascists, p. 78 The group also sought, albeit unsuccessfully, to forge links with Irish republican groups and to this end distributed leaflets in support of Bobby Sands during his 1981 hunger strike.Hill & Bell, The Other Face of terror, pp. 194-195 However in a subsequent volte-face the VMO threw its lot in with Ulster loyalism and attempted to link up with the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF). This came to nothing either however after the UVF rejected the VMO's request that they should target Jews, with the UVF a pro-Israeli group in opposition to the pro-Palestine stance of republicans.Jim Cusack & Henry McDonald, UVF, Poolbeg, 1997, pp. 218-219 In the seventies, VMO gained international attention by repatriating the corpses of former collaborators of World War Two to their homeland. In Austria, a VMO commando (Operation Brevier) claimed to have dug up the corpse of the priest Cyriel Verschaeve, a leading figure of the collaboration, and buried it again in Flemish soil.Western Europe The dead bodies of Staf De Clercq, the former leader of the Vlaams Nationaal Verbond (Operation Delta), and Anton Mussert, the former Dutch NSB leader (Operation Wolfsangel), were also dug up and reburied in Flanders.

The end of the VMO  In 1981, 106 VMO members were sentenced by the Antwerp Court to imprisonment although their sentences were overturned the following year on appeal.Wilkinson, The New Fascists, pp. 148-149 In 1983, the VMO was condemned as a private militia by the Ghent Court of Appeal and outlawed. Despite this verdict, the VMO was considered to be active and operational until the late eighties, when several similar organizations were founded to replace the VMO. The two most successful of these VMO successors are the Odal Group and Voorpost.

History Construction of the advanced Fubuki-class destroyers was authorized as part of the Imperial Japanese Navy's expansion program from fiscal 1923, intended to give Japan a qualitative edge with the world's most modern ships.Fitzsimons, Illustrated Encyclopedia of 20th Century Weapons and Warfare p.1040 The Fubuki class had performance that was a quantum leap over previous destroyer designs, so much so that they were designated . The large size, powerful engines, high speed, large radius of action and unprecedented armament gave these destroyers the firepower similar to many light cruisers in other navies.Peattie & Evans, Kaigun pages 221‚Äì222. Uranami, built at the Uraga Dock Company was laid down on 28 April 1927, launched on 29 November 1928 and commissioned on 30 June 1929. Originally assigned hull designation \\"Destroyer No. 44\\", she was renamed Uranami in 1935. Operational history On completion, Uranami was assigned to Destroyer Division 11 under the IJN 2nd Fleet. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, Uranami helped cover landings of Japanese forces during the Battle of Shanghai in 1937, and subsequent landings of Japanese forces at Hangzhou in northern China. =World War II history= At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Uranami was initially assigned to Destroyer Division 19, Squadron 3 of the IJN 1st Fleet, and had deployed from Kure Naval District to the port of Samah on Hainan Island. From 4 December 1941 to the end of the year, Uranami covered the landings of Japanese troops in \\"Operation E\\" (the invasion of Malaya) and \\"Operation B\\" (the invasion of British Borneo), capturing the Norwegian merchant ship SS Hafthor on 7 December. On 19 December, Uranami sank the Dutch submarine with assistance from her sister ships and and rescued 32 survivors.Brown. Warship Losses of World War II Uranami was part of the escort for the heavy cruisers , , and out of Samah and Camranh Bay, French Indochina in support of \\"Operation L\\" (the invasion of Banka and Palembang and the Anambas Islands, \\"Operation J\\" (the invasion of Java) and \\"Operation T\\" (the invasion of northern Sumatra). On 23 March 1942, Uranami provided close cover for the \\"Operation D\\" (the invasion of the Andaman Islands. She served patrol and escort duties out of Port Blair during the Japanese raids into the Indian Ocean. On 13‚Äì22 April she returned via Singapore and Camranh Bay to Kure Naval Arsenal, for maintenance.* On 4‚Äì5 June 1942, Uranami participated in the Battle of Midway by escorting Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's Main Body, suffering minor damage after the battle in a collision with sister ship , requiring a return to Kure Naval Arsenal for repairs. Once these repairs were complete, Uranami escorted the armed merchant cruiser Kiyozumi maru as far as Singapore and then continued on to Mergui for a projected second Indian Ocean raid. The operation was cancelled due to the Guadalcanal campaign, and Uranami was ordered to the Solomon Islands instead. During the Battle of the Eastern Solomons on 24 August Uranami escorted the fleet supply group to Guadalcanal. Throughout September and October, Uranami participated in a very large number of \\"Tokyo Express\\" high speed transport missions to Guadalcanal.D‚ÄôAlbas. Death of a Navy: Japanese Naval Action in World War II. =Guadalcanal= On 14‚Äì15 November, Uranami was involved in the Second Naval Battle of Guadalcanal. She was attached to a scouting force under the command of Rear Admiral Shintar≈ç Hashimoto in the light cruiser . When American Admiral Willis A. Lee's Task Force 64 was located and attacked near Savo Island, Uranami came to the assistance of Ayanami and the light cruiser .Hammel. Guadalcanal: Decision at Sea. Fire from Ayanami, Nagara, and the Uranami sank two of the four American destroyers involved ( and ), mortally wounded (which was scuttled after the battle), and severely damaged , causing heavy American losses in the first phase of the battle. Soon after, Ayanami was targeted and shelled by the battleship , receiving critical damage. Uranami evacuated the crippled destroyer (which was scuttled after the battle). After the battle, Uranami escorted the aircraft carrier from Truk to Yokosuka, returning to Rabaul in mid-February 1943 to resume patrol, escort and transport missions in the Solomons. On 25 February 1943, Uranami was reassigned to the Southwest Area Fleet. During the Battle of the Bismarck Sea on 1‚Äì4 March, Uranami sustained repeated air attacks without damage, and assisted in the rescue of survivors. After making several escort missions in the eastern Netherlands East Indies in April, Uranami suffered severe damage on 2 April by striking a reef near Makassar. Taken to Surabaya, repairs were not complete until the end of August. Returning to patrol duty in September, Uranami escorted convoys to Singapore to the end of the year. In early 1944, Uranami sortied from Singapore with the cruiser on a troop transport run to Mergui and Penang, and returned alone to Singapore with the survivors of the torpedoed Kuma, which had been sunk by HMS Tally-Ho on 11 January 1944. From 27 February to 25 March, Uranami escorted the cruisers , and in another commerce raiding operation in the Indian Ocean. =Convoy TA 1 to Ormoc= Uranamis final mission was the first major coordinated troop movement to Leyte during the Battle of Leyte Gulf that began 21 October 1944. The troops were to be taken from Manila via Mindanao to Ormoc. The ships involved in this mission were designated Convoy TA 1, and included heavy cruiser Aoba, light cruiser , Uranami, three new s (, , and ), and two new s, ( and ). The mission was led by Rear Admiral Naomasa Sakonju in Aoba. Prior to the mission proper, on 23 October Aoba was torpedoed by the submarine and disabled. Sakonju transferred to Kinu and had Aoba towed to port for repairs. The next morning Uranami and Kinu, fighting for Mindanao, avoided three flights from Task Force 38 as the Battle of Leyte Gulf opened. The ships only took minor damage in the strafing runs, but 4 crewmen were killed aboard Uranami and nine were wounded. Uranami also suffered a punctured fuel tank which left her leaking oil. The actual mission began 25 October with the arrival of the transports. The Battle of Leyte Gulf was in full swing and so the convoy largely escaped American intervention. The IJA 41st Regiment was successfully delivered to Ormoc. Here, the two smaller T.101 transports broke off to pick up troops from a different location as Kinu, Uranami, and the three T.1s headed back to Manila. On the morning of 26 October, while crossing the Jintotolo Channel between Masbate and Panay, approximately 80 aircraft from four of the escort carriers of Task Force 77.4.2 \\"Taffy 2\\" (, , , and ) began bombing, strafing, and rocketing the convoy. Uranami took two bombs and several rockets killing 103 crewmen, (including its captain, Lieutenant Commander Sako) before sinking around noon at position , southeast of Masbate. Three empty transports (which had lagged behind during the battle) arrived that afternoon to pick up survivors, including 94 from Uranami. Uranami was stricken from the navy list on 10 December 1944. The shipwreck The shipwreck of Uranami has not yet been found, although Kinu was discovered by divers from the on 15 July 1945 in about of water. Uranami sank about away, and is probably at a similar depth, which would place it within the reach of technical divers.

Bellinger III is an American lawyer who served as the Legal Adviser for the U.S. Department of State and the National Security Council during the George W. Bush administration. He is now a partner at the Washington, D.C. law firm Arnold & Porter, and Adjunct Senior Fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Education and earlier career Bellinger was educated at St. Albans School in Washington, D.C. Thereafter, he received his A.B. cum laude in 1982 from Princeton University's School of Public and International Affairs and his J.D. cum laude in 1986 from Harvard Law School. He also received an M.A. in Foreign Affairs in 1991 from the University of Virginia, where he was awarded a Woodrow Wilson Foreign Affairs Fellowship. Bellinger served as Counsel for National Security Matters in the Criminal Division of the Department of Justice from 1997 to 2001. He served previously as Counsel to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence (1996), as General Counsel to the Commission on the Roles and Capabilities of the U.S. intelligence community (1995‚Äì1996), and as Special Assistant to Director of Central Intelligence William Webster (1988‚Äì1991). From 1991 to 1995, he practiced law with Wilmer Cutler & Pickering in Washington, D.C. Bush administration = National Security Council = In February 2001, Bellinger was appointed as Senior Associate Counsel to the President and Legal Adviser to the National Security Council at the White House, where he served as the principal lawyer for National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and the NSC staff. He was in the White House Situation Room on 9/11 and later was the primary lawyer for the White House in dealing with the 9/11 Commission. He was one of the drafters of the legislation that created the Office of the Director of National Intelligence. At the White House, Bellinger was considered a moderate and often clashed with more conservative lawyers in the administration over international law and the Administration's detention policies, especially over the treatment of detainees. After 9/11, Bellinger, and Rice were excluded by other officials in the administration from the preparation of President Bush's order establishing military commissions. = U.S. State Department = Bellinger managed the Senate confirmation process for Condoleezza Rice as Secretary of State and co-directed her State Department transition team. He was nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate as the Legal Adviser of the State Department in April 2005. He continued to serve as a member of Rice's \\"inner circle\\". As Legal Adviser, Bellinger was the principal adviser on all domestic and international law matters to the Department of State, the Foreign Service, and the diplomatic and consular posts abroad. He was also the principal adviser on legal matters relating to the conduct of foreign relations to other agencies and, through the Secretary of State, to the President and the National Security Council. Bellinger was part of a group of Bush administration officials who advocated for minimum standards of treatment for detainees, protections for detainees prosecuted by military commissions, and the closure of the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. He helped persuade the White House to support the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 (the McCain Amendment) and to close the secret CIA black sites in 2006. After the Supreme Court held in Hamdan v. Rumsfeld that Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions applied to the U.S. conflict with Al-Qaeda, Bellinger wrote a memo to the Department of Justice stating that the CIA interrogation program was not consistent with the Geneva Conventions. At the same time, Bellinger was also called upon to defend the Bush administration's counterterrorism policies to skeptical international audiences, serving as the administration's \\"chief flak catcher abroad\\". He gave numerous speeches and interviews explaining the U.S. legal approach to terrorism. Rice called Bellinger \\"indefatigable\\" in trying to address the concerns of U.S. allies. In 2006, Bellinger headed the U.S. delegation that negotiated the Third Additional Protocol to the Geneva Conventions that allowed the humanitarian aid societies of Israel and the Palestinian territories to join the International Red Cross/Red Crescent Federation. Bellinger has been credited with leading the Bush administration's shift in approach towards the International Criminal Court (ICC) in the administration's second term after President Bush agreed to the UN referral of the genocide in Darfur to the ICC in March 2005. In a series of speeches, Bellinger said the United States was prepared to assist the Court's investigation in Sudan even if it did not intend to join the Rome Statute. He has urged Congress to amend the American Servicemembers Protection Act to allow the United States to provide more support to the Court in certain war crimes investigations. In 2008, Bellinger represented the United States before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in a case filed by Mexico after the Supreme Court in Medellin v Texas invalidated President Bush's February 2005 order directing courts in Texas and other states to comply with the ICJ's 2004 order in Case Concerning Avena and Other Mexican Nationals that the United States review the convictions and death sentences of a group of Mexican nationals who had not been notified of their right to consular access under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. He later testified before Congress in support of legislation that would allow federal courts to review the death sentences of foreign nationals who had not been notified of their rights to consular access. During his term as Legal Adviser Bellinger initiated a bi-annual dialogue on international law between the State Department Legal Adviser and his/her EU foreign ministry counterparts which continued after his tenure. Bellinger's term as Legal Adviser ended on January 20, 2009. The then-Principal Deputy Legal Adviser, Joan Donoghue, served in an acting capacity until the Obama Administration's nominee, Harold Koh, was confirmed as Legal Adviser by the U.S. Senate in March 2009. Post-government service In 2009, after leaving the State Department, Bellinger joined the Washington, DC law firm of Arnold & Porter where he is a partner in the firm's public international law and national security law practices. He is also an Adjunct Senior Fellow in International and National Security Law at the Council on Foreign Relations, where he directed a program on international justice. He speaks and writes regularly on international law issues. He is a senior contributor to Lawfare, a national security law blog. In 2010, Bellinger publicly defended Obama administration officials who had been criticized for previously representing detainees at Guantanamo Bay. Bellinger was critical of the Obama administration's heavy reliance on drone strikes to kill terrorists. In testimony before Congress in 2012, he urged the Obama administration to do more to explain the legality of targeted killings and to make its drone program more transparent. In 2013, Bellinger was a signatory to an amicus curiae brief submitted to the Supreme Court by a group of former Republican officials in support of same-sex marriage in Hollingsworth v. Perry. In 2016 Bellinger drafted the \\"50 G.O.P. Officials Warn Donald Trump Would Put Nation's Security 'at Risk'\\" letter. In November 2018, Bellinger joined a group formed by George Conway, \\"Checks and Balances,\\" composed of more than a dozen members of the conservative-libertarian Federalist Society, which had been instrumental in selecting candidates for the Trump administration to appoint to federal courts. The New York Times reported the group is \\"urging their fellow conservatives to speak up about what they say are the Trump administration‚Äôs betrayals of bedrock legal norms,\\" with Bellinger stating \\"Conservative lawyers are not doing enough to protect constitutional principles that are being undermined by the statements and actions of this president.\\" In August 2020 Bellinger was one of 70 former senior security officials who took out a full page ad in the Wall Street Journal, saying they would vote for Joe Biden as President. Bellinger is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, the American Law Institute, the American Council on Germany, and the British-American Project. He is also member of the Secretary State's Advisory Committee on International Law. In 2012, he was appointed to the Defense Legal Policy Board. In October 2012, the American Law Institute named him as a Counselor for the Restatement Fourth of the Foreign Relations Law of the United States. Bellinger is a former Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of his alma mater, St. Albans School. He is a Trustee of the Protestant Episcopal Cathedral Foundation and sits on the America Abroad Media advisory board. References External links * State Department Biography (2005).

The 3-year letterman (1950‚Äì52) was USC's most valuable player as a senior in 1952. Boyd then began his coaching career, first for five years in the high school ranks (at El Segundo, California and Alhambra, California), then for six years at the junior college level at Santa Ana College (his 1959 team finished second at the state tournament) and then collegiately, first at Seattle University, where Boyd went 41-13 in 2 seasons (1964‚Äì65). After a year out of coaching while working for Converse athletic shoes, Boyd embarked on a 13-year career (1967‚Äì79) as head coach of the USC basketball team. Boyd's teams went 216-131 overall and played in the post-season four times (the 1979 NCAA tournament, 1973 NIT and 1974 and 1975 Commissioner's Conference tourney). Boyd's 1971 team, which went 24-2 and was ranked fifth in the nation (USC was ranked first at midseason), is regarded among USC's best (Boyd also won 24 games in 1974).

It is located on the North Clyde Line, 12¬Ω miles (20 km) west of Edinburgh.  History  The station was opened as Houston by the Edinburgh and Bathgate Railway on 12 November 1849. On 1 August 1856 it was renamed as Uphall. The station closed on 9 January 1956. Uphall Station was a large hub, centred on West Lothian oil production and shale mining. The area has changed beyond recognition in recent years. Before the M8 was constructed, Uphall oil works lay just north of the station, with extensive exchange sidings located next to the station. A branch continued north to Uphall, then swung eastward just south of Ecclesmachan (where a branch from Threemiletown joined). The line continued to the Greendykes area of Broxburn, (Albyn or Albion Oil works) where it connected with the lines from Broxburn junction (Winchburgh) (the Broxburn Railway) and Drumshoreland. Just to the east of the station lay Uphall Jct., connecting the Camps Branch. This line, 3 miles and 52 chains in length, began with a large set of exchange sidings adjacent to the E&B;, and served various sidings, the Pumpherston Oil Co., East Calder and terminated at Raw Camps (Torrance's) quarry. The NBR Camps branch formed a junction with the Caledonian Camps branch at Camps Goods station. The course of these lines can be seen on Ordnance Survey Maps One- inch \\"Popular\\" edition.  Reopening  The station's reopening, with a single platform, came as part of the reopening of the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line on 24 March 1986. Ever since, train services at Uphall were normally operated by diesel multiple units (initially Class 101s, then from 1987 Class 150s and by 2008 or Class 170s). The station was reopened by British Rail. The railway was electrified in October 2010 as part of the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link, which resulted in a second platform being brought into service in October 2008. As of December 2010, all trains on the Uphall station line are electrified with passenger usage increasing dramatically due to the reliability of the trains, increased frequency (every 15 minutes Monday - Saturday during peak times) and the short journey times (15‚Äì20 minutes into the centre of Edinburgh).  Service  = Winter 2010/11 (From 12 December 2010) = During the week there is an eastbound service to Edinburgh every 15 minutes which takes between 15‚Äì20 minutes to reach the centre of Edinburgh and 10 minutes to reach Edinburgh Park. An westbound service of two trains per hour to Milngavie and two trains per hour to Helensburgh Central, both via Glasgow operates 6 days a week as well (half hourly to Helensburgh only in the evening and on Sunday). The early morning commuter trains to Edinburgh are exceptionally popular to such an extent there is commonly no available parking at the station after 8.30am, this has pushed house prices within walking of the distance of the rail station up in recent years as passenger numbers have grown by around 35-40% a year to an estimated 600,000 in 2013/14. The station has shelter and a ticket machine, no ticket barriers. = Access = A car parking area is located to the north and south of the station. The only access between platforms is by public footway beyond either end of the station. At the eastern end this is via an underpass. The walking time between platforms, or between eastbound platform and car park is around 2 minutes.

In the era of modern antibiotics the majority of neurosyphilis cases have been reported in HIV-infected patients. Meningitis is the most common neurological presentation in early syphilis. Tertiary syphilis symptoms are exclusively neurosyphilis, though neurosyphilis may occur at any stage of infection. To diagnose neurosyphilis, patients undergo a lumbar puncture to obtain cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. The CSF is tested for antibodies for specific Treponema pallidum antigens. The preferred test is the VDRL test, which is sometimes supplemented by fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS). Historically, the disease was studied under the Tuskegee study, a notable example of unethical human experimentation. The study was done on approximately 400 African-American men with untreated syphilis who were followed from 1932 to 1972 and compared to approximately 200 men without syphilis. The study began without informed consent of the subjects and was continued by the United States Public Health Service until 1972. The researchers failed to notify and withheld treatment for patients despite knowing penicillin was found as an effective cure for neurosyphilis. After four years of follow up, neurosyphilis was identified in 26.1% of patients vs. 2.5% of controls. After 20 years of followup, 14% showed signs of neurosyphilis and 40% had died from other causes. Research practices were changed, in part in response to the Tuskegee study, with the passing of the National Research Act in 1974, the establishment of institutional review boards and informed consent practices, and a presidential apology issued in 1997.  Signs and symptoms  The signs and symptoms of neurosyphilis vary with the disease stage of syphilis. The stages of syphilis are categorized as primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary. It is important to note that neurosyphilis may occur at any stage of infection. Meningitis is the most common neurological presentation in early syphilis. It typically occurs in the secondary stage, arising within one year of initial infection. The symptoms are similar to other forms of meningitis. The most common associated with neurosyphilitic meningitis is cranial nerve palsy, especially of the facial nerve.Radolf JD, Tramont EC, Salazar JC. Syphilis (Treponema pallidum).Bennett J, Dolin R, Blaser M, eds. Mandell, Douglas, and Bennett's Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases. 8th ed. New York, NY: Saunders; 2015: 2684‚Äì2709.e4 Nearly any part of the eye may be involved. The most common form of ocular syphilis is uveitis. Other forms include episcleritis, vitritis, retinitis, papillitis, retinal detachment, and interstitial keratitis. Meningovascular syphilis usually occurs in late syphilis but may affect those with early disease. It is due to inflammation of the vasculature supplying the central nervous system, that results in ischemia. It typically occurs about 6‚Äì7 years after initial infection and it may affect those with early disease. It may present as stroke or spinal cord infarct. Signs and symptoms vary with vascular territory involved. The middle cerebral artery is most often affected. Parenchymal syphilis occurs years to decades after initial infection. It presents with the constellation of symptoms known as tabes dorsalis, because of a degenerative process of the posterior columns of the spinal cord. The constellation includes Argyll Robertson pupil, ataxic wide- based gait, paresthesias, bowel or bladder incontinence, loss of position and vibratory sense, loss of deep pain and temperature sensation, acute episodic gastrointestinal pain, Charcot joints, and general paresis. Gummatous disease may also present with destructive inflammation and space-occupying lesions. It is caused by granulomatous destruction of visceral organs. They most often involve the frontal and parietal lobes of the brain. = Psychiatric = Although neurosyphilis is a neurological disease psychiatric symptoms might appear due to overall damage to the brain. These symptoms can make the diagnosis more difficult. They can include: * Dementia * Mania * Psychosis * Depression * Delirium An important note is that these symptoms are not always present, and when they are, they usually appear in more advanced stages of the disease.https://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1169231-overview = Complications = The Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction is an immune-mediated response to syphilis therapy occurring within 2‚Äì24 hours. The exact mechanisms of reaction are unclear, however most likely caused by proinflammatory treponemal lipoproteins that are released from dead and dying organisms following antibiotic treatment. It is typically characterized by fever, headache, myalgia and possibly intensification of skin rash. It most often occurs in early-stage syphilis (up to 50%‚Äì75% of patients with primary and secondary syphilis). It is usually self-limiting and managed with antipyretics and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. Risk factors There are several risk factors: high-risk sexual behavior from unprotected sex and multiple sexual partners. Syphilis is endemic among men who have sex with men. The HIV infection antiretroviral therapy (ART) suppresses HIV transmission, but not syphilis transmission. It may explain rising rates of syphilis among men who have sex with men. It may also be associated with recreational drug use.  Pathophysiology  The pathogenesis is not fully known, in part due to fact that the organism is not easily cultured. Within days to weeks after initial infection, Treponema pallidum disseminates via blood and lymphatics. The organism may accumulate in perivascular spaces of nearly any organ, including the central nervous system (CNS). It is unclear why some patients develop CNS infection and others do not. Rarely, organisms may invade any structures of the eye (such as cornea, anterior chamber, vitreous and choroid, and optic nerve) and cause local inflammation and edema.In primary or secondary syphilis, invasion of the meninges may result in lymphocytic and plasma cell infiltration of perivascular spaces (Virchow-Robin spaces). The extension of cellular immune response to the brainstem and spinal cord causes inflammation and necrosis of small meningeal vessels. In tertiary syphilis, reactivation of chronic latent infection may result in meningovascular syphilis, arising from endarteritis obliterans of small, medium, or large arteries supplying the CNS. The parenchymal syphilis, presents as tabes dorsalis and general paresis. Tabes dorsalis thought to be due to irreversible degeneration of nerve fibers in posterior columns of the spinal cord involving the lumbosacral and lower thoracic levels. The general paresis is caused by meningeal vascular inflammation and ependymal granulomatous infiltration may lead to neuronal loss, along with astrocytic and microglial proliferation and damage may preferentially occur in the cerebral cortex, striatum, hypothalamus, and meninges. Concurrent infection of T. pallidum with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) has been found to affect the course of syphilis. Syphilis can lie dormant for 10 to 20 years before progressing to neurosyphilis, but HIV may accelerate the rate of the progress. Also, infection with HIV has been found to cause penicillin therapy to fail more often. Therefore, neurosyphilis has once again been prevalent in societies with high HIV rates and limited access to penicillin. Diagnosis To diagnose neurosyphilis, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis is required. Lumbar puncture (\\"spinal tap\\") is used to acquire CSF. The Venereal Disease Research Laboratory test of the CSF is the preferred test for making a diagnosis of neurosyphilis. A positive test confirms neurosyphilis but a negative result does not rule out neurosyphilis. Due to the low sensitivity of the CSF VDRL, fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption test (FTA-ABS) can be used to supplement VDRL. Reported sensitivity is variable. False-negative antibody test result occurring when antibody concentration is so high that agglutination reaction cannot occur, which is typically seen during secondary stage and can be overcome by diluting test sample 1:10.CSF white blood cell count is often elevated in the early stages of neurosyphilis, ranging from about 50 to 100 white blood cells/mcL with a lymphocyte predominance. Cell counts are typically lower in late syphilis. Regardless of syphilis disease stage, the absence of CSF white blood cells rules out neurosyphilis. Treatment Penicillin is used to treat neurosyphilis. Two examples of penicillin therapies include: * Aqueous penicillin G 3‚Äì4 million units every four hours for 10 to 14 days. * One daily intramuscular injection and oral probenecid four times daily, both for 10 to 14 days. Follow-up blood tests are generally performed at 3, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months to make sure the infection is gone. Lumbar punctures for CSF fluid analysis are generally performed every 6 months until cell counts normalize. All patients with syphilis should be tested for HIV infection. All cases of syphilis should be reported to public health authorities and public health departments can aid in partner notification, testing, and determining need for treatment. The treatment success is measured with a 4-fold drop in the nontreponemal antibody test. In early-stage syphilis drop should occur in 6‚Äì12 months. in late syphilis drop can take 12‚Äì24 months. Titers may decline more slowly in persons who have previously had syphilis. In people who cannot take penicillin it is uncertain if other antibiotic therapy is effective for treating neurosyphilis. Incidence There is a 9.3% syphilis incidence among patients with HIV, with highest rates reported among African-Americans, Hispanics, and homosexual men.

Johnson of Co. E, 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment. From the Liljenquist Family Collection of Civil War Photographs, Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress The 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment was a Union army regiment that participated in the American Civil War. It had the distinction of being the oldest unit in continuous service from Pennsylvania. History The 11th Pennsylvania was recruited from several counties in Pennsylvania as a three-month regiment on April 26, 1861, and sent to Camp Curtin, Harrisburg for training and organization. Phaon Jarrett served as its first colonel, with Richard Coulter as lieutenant colonel and William D. Earnest as major. It was assigned to Robert Patterson's Army of the Shenandoah. The regiment received the nickname \\"The Bloody Eleventh\\" at the Battle of Falling Waters, Virginia, July 2, 1861. The 11th was reorganized as a three-year regiment in the August of the same year at Camp Curtin in Harrisburg. After a few weeks of drill, the regiment was given garrison duty at Annapolis, Maryland. In April, it was moved to Mannassas Junction, where it guarded the railroad. It was again transferred, this time to the Shenandoah Valley, in late May as part of Irvin McDowell's Corps. They fought in the Battles of Cedar Mountain and Second Bull Run. After the Army of Virginia was merged into the Army of the Potomac, the reconstituted regiment became part of the I Corps. At Turner's Gap at the Battle of South Mountain, the 11th came under light fire only, losing two men wounded. At the Battle of Antietam three days later, it was heavily engaged on the Union right around the West Woods. In this battle, it lost 27 killed, 89 wounded, and two captured. When the original three-year enlistment period expired in January 1864, many of the men re-enrolled in the regiment at the influence of Brig. Gen. Richard Coulter, a former colonel of the regiment. Because of this, the unit was designated \\"veteran volunteers.\\" During the reorganization of the Army in the spring of 1864, the 11th became part of the V Corps, as the old I Corps had been disbanded, and surviving units transferred to the V Corps. The 11th fought in multiple battles in the Eastern Theater, including Second Bull Run, Antietam, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, Grant's Overland Campaign, the Siege of Petersburg, and the Appomattox Campaign. It was mustered out on July 1, 1865. Monument to the 11th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment at the Battle of Gettysburg. It is located off Doubleday Avenue on Oak Ridge in the Gettysburg National Military Park, Gettysburg, PA, USA. The location is near the right flank of the First Corps on July 1, 1863. Note the inclusion of the regimental mascot, Sallie (see info at left). A total of 1,890 men served in the regiment during the war, and only 340 men were discharged at war's end. Among the numerous casualties was one that would stand out as an undying remembrance of the unit and its loyalty to the cause. The regiment's beloved mascot, Sallie Ann Jarrett, \\"a brindle, bull-terrier\\"Bates, Samuel P., \\"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\\" 1875, p. 1103 similar to today's American Staffordshire Terrier, traveled everywhere with the unit. \\"Sallie\\" was said to have hated three things -- Rebels, Democrats, and Women. Her loyalty was undying, for at Gettysburg, after the battle on the First Day was over, Sallie, tired and hungry, ambled out to where her brave comrades had fought and died. She lay down with the dead, until she was found, weak and close to death herself, on July 4, 1863. Her friends nursed her back to health, and she fought with the unit in every battle until she was mortally wounded at Hatcher's Run in February 1865. Although under a \\"murderous fire,\\"Bates, Samuel P., \\"Martial Deeds of Pennsylvania,\\" p. 1103 several of the men gave her a proper burial where she fell. Never forgetting the most devoted member of their regiment, in 1890 the veterans of the 11th forever memorialized her by placing her bronze likeness on their monument on Oak Ridge in the Gettysburg National Military Park. Casualties: * Killed and mortally wounded: 12 officers, 224 enlisted men * Wounded: ? officers, ? enlisted men * Died of disease: 4 officers, 177 enlisted men * Captured or missing: ? officers, ? enlisted men * Total casualties: ? officers, ? enlisted men  Notable members  The 11th Pennsylvania was commanded for most of its service by Colonel Richard Coulter. Two of the regiment's men were awarded the Medal of Honor, both for capturing battle flags. Private George W. Reed earned his at the Battle of Globe Tavern on August 21, 1864, and Sergeant Hiram H. De Lavie at the Battle of Five Forks on April 1, 1865. William Henry Locke, the regimental chaplain, later wrote a history of the 11th Pennsylvania.

The segment maintained by FDOT begins at US 41 north of the entrance to Rainbow Springs State Park, where it moves at a northeast angle before crossing under a narrow railroad bridge. The road passes by the Ocala International Airport before entering the city limits and crossing under Interstate 75 at Exit 352. East of I-75 SR 40 continues as a four-lane divided highway where it passes the site of the former Region #5 Headquarters of the Florida Department of Transportation. CSX's S-Line, which once carried the Amtrak Palmetto runs beneath the road before intersecting with US 27-301-441. East of the triplex, SR 40 climbs a hill and passes just north of the Ocala Historic Commercial District, and south of the Ocala Union Station. At the intersection of Northeast 25th Street SR 40 turns northeast where it gains a wide tree-lined divider. It passes along the northern edge of the Ocala Golf Club, then serves as the western terminus of CR 314 (Northeast 7th Street) and the eastern terminus of State Road 492 (Northeast 14th Street), and later the Appleton Museum of Art, which includes the Ocala Civic Theatre. From there, the divider ends as the road enters Silver Springs, Florida where it intersects with the northern terminus of State Road 35 and southern terminus of County Road 35 at the Silver Springs Nature Theme Park. The road runs along the north side of Silver Springs State Park, where it serves as the eastern terminus of State Road 326 and the southern terminus of CR 315, before it climbs the Bert Dosh Memorial Bridge in order to cross the Ocklawaha River, which was also intended to be part of the Cross Florida Barge Canal, and is now part of the Cross Florida Greenway and the Florida National Scenic Trail. Shortly after descending from that bridge, the highway intersects CR 314 for the second time, and then passes through Lynne where it intersects CR 314A, before bisecting the Ocala National Forest. Toward the eastern edge of the Juniper Springs Recreation Area, SR 40 approaches the intersection with State Road 19. Immediately after the SR 19 intersection, the road crosses the Marion-Lake County line and runs along an overlook and camping area at Wildcat Lake. East of the intersection of CR 445 & CR 445A in Astor Park, it passes through Astor where it crosses the St. Johns River via the Astor Bridge. Immediately across the bridge, on the east bank of the St. Johns River, SR 40 passes through the unincorporated community of Volusia, one of the first European settlements in Florida, and the area for which Volusia, County was named. The bridge at Astor carries SR 40 across the St. Johns River, between Lake and Volusia Counties As the road leaves Lake George State Forest and enters Barberville, it shifts to the northeast at the intersection of Lemmon Road, then intersects CR 3 and then the Barberville Flea Market and Post Office before a railroad crossing for the CSX \\"A\\" line a block west of the intersection of U.S. Route 17. The road curves back east, and then northeast again as it passes along the south side of Volusia Speedway Park before the intersection of State Road 11 in DeLeon Springs. From there, the road bisects the Tomoka Wildlife Management Area Union-Camp Tract and, after passing by some residential areas and intersecting Country Acres Boulevard, the road goes from two lanes to four as turns back into a divided highway. Despite officially entering the City of Ormond Beach, the highway runs along the north side of Tiger Bay State Forest and the Dan Rice Airport, but then becomes more suburban as it approaches the vicinity of the Tomoka River just before Interstate 95 at Exit 268 which is a block away from CR 4009. SR 40 crosses the Halifax River on the Granada Bridge East of I-95 & CR 4009, the road curves northeast again as it runs along residential areas along the Tomoka River, until it curves east before crossing over a bridge over one of its tributaries, just west of the intersection of State Road 5A (North and South Nova Road). The road makes one last left curve at Old Tomoka Avenue before approaching the grade crossing of the Florida East Coast Railroad main line, and then intersects with US 1 (North and South Yonge Street). The route continues, but the divider ends as SR 40 comes in close proximity to Ormond Beach City Hall on the southwest corner of Granada Boulevard and Beach Street(CR 4011). From there, SR 40 is overlapped by the Ormond Scenic Loop and Trail, where the divider begins again on the Granada Bridge over the Halifax River, and immediately intersects John Anderson Drive(CR 2803), where one leg of the scenic route heads north and West Granada Boulevard becomes East Granda Boulevard, before finally terminating at State Road A1A. The other leg of the Ormond Beach Scenic Loop heads north on SR A1A. Despite the fact that SR 40 terminates at SR A1A, East Granada Boulevard continues as a beach access road.

Authority to recruit men for the regiment had been granted by Pennsylvania Governor Andrew Curtin on August 1, 1861, to Lycoming County resident John C.

Upon arrival in Washington, the 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers were marched to the Kalorama Heights in Georgetown, where they made camp at \\"Camp Kalorama,\\" and received additional training.Bates, p. 47.Mott, pp.25-26. =1862= Ordered into winter quarters, the 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers were housed in barracks \\"on Meridian Hill, at Fourteenth street, in the rear of Columbia College,\\" according to Bates. While here, they continued to perform in a series of dress parades as part of their ongoing training. Illness plagued the regiment during this phase of service with a number of 52nd Pennsylvanians contracting typhoid fever or variola (smallpox); several died. The regiment's ranks were further thinned when 10 men volunteered for gunboat service on detached duty (many of whom were then killed in June 1862 while serving aboard the steamer during the Battle of Saint Charles, Arkansas).Bates, pp. 47-48.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 116. In March 1862, the regiment was assigned to the 1st Brigade, 3rd Division, IV Corps of the Army of the Potomac, and on the 28th of that month, moved out with its brigade. Marching for Alexandria, Virginia, the regiment boarded the steamship USS Constitution, which ran aground twice after departing from that city's docks. Following their arrival at Hampton Roads, the regiment transferred to a smaller steamer, the USS Hero, which took them to Newport News. During their trip, the 52nd Pennsylvanians were fired upon by a Confederate artillery battery stationed on Craney Island, but escaped without damage to the ship or injury to the men. According to Bates, on April 17, the 52nd Pennsylvania and its brigade \\"advanced and took position in front of the enemy's lines at Lee's Mills, Smith's Division on the right, and Couch's on the left\\" with the \\"main operations of the siege ... directed against his fortifications at Yorktown.\\"Bates, p. 48.Fifty-Second Pennsylvania, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 116.Mott, pp. 27-30. Now part of the Peninsula Campaign,Bates, pp. 48-54. the 52nd Pennsylvania saw its first serious combat action in the Battle of Williamsburg on May 5, 1862. Assigned to point at the head of a Union Army column marching on Fort Magruder, part of the regiment was caught in an exposion of an improvised explosive device (IED). According to Bates, General Henry M. Naglee, his staff, and members of the 52nd's A Company had just crossed a parapet at the fort \\"when a torpedo, which had been skillfully planted in the way, exploded under Company F, instantly killing one man [Private John Pruyne of F Company], and horribly mutilating six [or nine] others.\\"Bates, p. 48.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, pp. 116-117.Mott, pp. 30-34. On May 20, General Naglee selected one hundred men from the 52nd Pennsylvania, designated them as sharpshooters, and placed them under the command of Captain Greanleaf Davis, commanding officer of the 52nd's E Company. Although this detachment came under heavy musket and artillery fire while assigned to reconnaissance of Bottom's Bridge and neighboring rail lines, it was able to maintain control of its assigned area, enabling Union forces to cross the Chickahominy River just 14 miles outside of Richmond.Bates, p. 49.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, pp. 116-117.Mott, pp. 35. During the evening of May 23, General George B. McClellan ordered General Naglee to move his army toward Seven Pines with these words:Bates, p. 49. > Your instructions for the reconnaissance today, are as follows: You will, if > possible, advance to the Seven Pines, on the forks of the direct road to > Richmond, and the road turning to the right into the road leading from New > Bridge to Richmond, and hold that point if practicable.... You will push the > reconnaissance as far towards Richmond as practicable, without incurring too > much danger. In response, the 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers, under the command of Colonel Dodge, departed early the next morning. They were accompanied by the 104th Pennsylvania, which was commanded by Colonel Davis. Joining up with them at 8 a.m. were the 1st New York Artillery's 2nd battery and Regan's 7th Independent New York battery. With the new column formed, the men moved out onto the Williamsburg road at 9 a.m. At Creek Run, roughly 1.5 miles from Bottom's Bridge, they encountered and chased off a group of Confederate pickets. As they progressed further, more CSA pickets were encountered, as were five regiments of Tennessee infantrymen who were part of Hatton's Brigade, and infantrymen and artillerymen under the command of General J. E. B. Stuart. Naglee ordered the 104th Pennsylvania to move to the left of the Williamsburg road and the 52nd Pennsylvania to the right of the road while also extending itself across the railroad. Advancing, they made it as far as a forested area just past Savage Station, where they encountered a much heavier enemy presence. Naglee then moved Regan's battery to the right at the front edge of the forest, from which it shelled the woods on the road's left side. The 52nd Pennsylvania, also on the right, was ordered to move forward to a farm and orchard nearby, where its men could take shelter in and behind the buildings and fence on the property. The shelling and troop movements \\"lessened materially the fire of the enemy on the left,\\" according to Bates, enabling the 104th Pennsylvania to then also move forward. At 1 p.m., Gregg's Cavalry joined the Union force with Mink's artillery battery connecting with the group later that afternoon.Bates, pp. 49-50.Mott, pp. 35-36. Roughly a half mile outside of Seven Pines Corner, both regiments were subjected to withering fire from the enemy. The wood in front of the 52nd Pennsylvania was particularly thick with CSA skirmishers. In response, Naglee ordered the 104th Pennsylvania to fire obliquely on the enemy while the 52nd Pennsylvania continued its direct fire on CSA troops. Directing the 85th Pennsylvania to move forward to a position behind the railroad, he then ordered the 52nd Pennsylvania to \\"advance from the fence and buildings directly into the wood in front of it,\\" which \\"forced the enemy to leave precipitately the wood on the right.\\" At 4 p.m., Naglee directed the sharpshooters of the 52nd Pennsylvania to target enemy artillerymen; within 30 minutes, the fire from CSA batteries was significantly reduced, prompting CSA forces to retreat. Naglee then moved Gregg's Cavalry, part of Mink's Battery, the 85th New York, 104th Pennsylvania, and 52nd Pennsylvania forward, further scattering CSA troops. Naglee was then ordered by General Keyes to have his men stand down in order to prevent a larger scale engagement with the enemy.Bates, pp. 50-51.Mott, pp. 36-41. Ordering the sharpshooters from the 52nd Pennsylvania to advance during the early afternoon of May 25, Naglee then moved the 11th Maine, 104th Pennsylvania, two sections of Bailey's Artillery, and remainder of the 52 Pennsylvania forward in support of the sharpshooters who had advanced to a forested area 500 yards beyond Seven Pines in a \\"line extended perpendicular to the Williamsburg road, and across to the neighborhood of the Fair Oak Station,\\" according to a report made later by Naglee, who added that he then \\"ordered the artillery to open upon the enemy,\\" who were \\"forming in the open fields beyond the wood pile.\\" Advancing his pickets toward the sharpshooters, Naglee then also moved the 11th Maine and 104th Pennsylvania forward, which prompted another CSA retreat. The next day, he continued his advance, moving his troops within five miles of Richmond. On May 27, he then ordered the sharpshooters of the 52nd Pennsylvania to advance yet again, which they did, reaching Garnett's field along the Chickahomony River. The 52nd Pennsylvania was then ordered to make camp \\"on the Nine Mile road, a half mile beyond Fair Oaks, as a support to the pickets along Garnett's field.\\"Bates, p. 51.Mott, pp. 41-42. Sometime during the opening days of the aforementioned engagement, Private Dilton \\"Sid\\" Taylor of the 52nd Pennsylvania's G Company was wounded seriously enough to require medical treatment and a period of convalescence after which he was honorably discharged on a surgeon's certificate of disability on September 16, 1862.Bates, p. 82.Mott, p. 36. The next major interaction with the enemy by the 52nd Pennsylvania came during the Battle of Seven Pines (also known as the Battle of Fair Oaks) from May 30 to June 1, 1862. Stationed a half mile in front of and to the right of Seven Pines, this location brought the 52nd \\"into action on a different part of the field from the other regiments of the brigade, and at a somewhat later hour,\\" according to Bates, who noted that by the time the 52nd Pennsylvania was involved, CSA troops had already \\"turned the left flank\\" of the other Union troops at Fair Oaks, \\"broken through on the Williamsburg road,\\" and opened up a \\"destructive cross-fire\\" on Naglee's main force. In response, the 23rd Pennsylvania arrived, freeing up part of the 52nd Pennsylvania to advance. As it did, that detachment sustained a significant number of casualties; the 23rd Pennsylvania and remainder of the 52nd Pennsylvania were then forced to retreat. As the 52nd Pennsylvanians regrouped at sheltering structures along the Nine Mile road, they were then able to render \\"most effective service.\\" Crossing to the left of Couch's Union troops, they advanced again, and made their way through a forest near Seven Pines, \\"where they remained actively employed until dark.\\" At that point, CSA troops advanced \\"rapidly in masses to the rear of Nine Mile road,\\" forcing Union troops to retreat, but the 52nd Pennsylvania, \\"having their line of retreat cut off,\\" were forced to find another route of retreat. Escaping \\"by passing through the woods to the left and rear of the saw-mill at the White Oak Swamp\\" and then on to another Union line, they were finally able to reconnect with the 1st Brigade. McClellan later commended the brigade for gallantry. According to Bates, \\"Of the two hundred and forty-nine officers and men who went into the conflict, one hundred and twenty-five ... were killed or wounded. Of the latter were Captains Davis, who lost an arm, Lennard, Chamberlain, Weidensaul, and Carskaden.\\" As records were updated, the names of four more 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers were added to the list, bringing the regiment's total number of casualties to 129.Bates, pp. 52-53.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.pp. 42-59. On June 2, details were sent to recover the wounded and bury the dead. Among the dead was a member of F Company, whose body was found near a house at Seven Pines by his brother, a fellow 52nd Pennsylvanian, according to Mott, who added that wounded men who had been located by Captain Pickering and his detail were loaded onto an ambulance and returned to the regiment's encampment. When he reached the former camp of the 104th Pennsylvania near a house at Fair Oaks, Mott found more members of the 52nd who had been killed in action. In total of the 125 casualties, 26 had been killed in action, or died shortly after being mortally wounded. Among the wounded later identified by name by Mott in his history of the regiment were: Captain James Chamberlain and Lieutenants Samuel Cuskaden and J. P. S. Weidensaul of D Company, and Captains G. R. Lennard and Greenleaf P. Davis of Companies A and E.Mott, pp. 57-58, p. 77. The surviving members of the 52nd Pennsylvania were then assigned to fatigue duty, during which they strengthened built new rifle pits and redoubts in and around the Chickahominy while also strengthening existing defenses.Mott, p. 78. Ordered by McClellan to hold Bottom's Bridge and its neighboring railroad at all costs, or to destroy the two bridges there if his troops could not do so, Naglee once again turned to the sharpshooters of the 52nd Pennsylvania. Directing them, on June 26, to line the railroad along the Chickahominy River for a mile \\"above and below\\" the bridges, he then moved the remainder of the 52nd Pennsylvania under Lieutenant Colonel Hoyt into \\"redoubts, rifle pits, and on picket duty,\\" along with men from the 56th and 100th New York infantry. The situation remained relatively quiet until June 28 when a CSA force composed of two infantry regiments and an artillery battery with cavalry support \\"crossed the railroad, and under cover of the wood, took position on the high ground facing the Chickahominy, and about one thousand yards from the bridges.\\" In response, Naglee directed the artillery batteries of Brady, Miller and Morgan\\" to test their respective ranges against the enemy and, when he spotted movement, directed the Union batteries to open fire, forcing those CSA troops to retreat. By 7 p.m., Naglee's troops had successfully destroyed the railroad bridge, enabling his army to withdraw and bivouac on high ground near the White Oak Swamp Bridge.\\"Bates, pp. 53-54. In response to orders from McClellan to Naglee to move his troops into position to support Brigadier-General W. F. Smith's army, Naglee's men were next \\"in line of battle perpendicular to\\" those troops by 11 a.m. on June 30 with the \\"right resting on the main road leading from the White Oak Bridge [and] the left on the swamp, about three-fourths of a mile from the bridge ‚Äì a portion of the Fifty-second being deployed in the swamp, extending from the brigade to the bridge.\\" As a result, they were able to successfully repulse all enemy attempts to cross the river. Ordered to move with Smith's men at 10 p.m. that night, Naglee's men (including the 52nd Pennsylvania) then marched 17 miles to reach \\"Haxall's, on the James River,\\" arriving at 6 a.m., July 1. Withdrawing further to Harrison's Landing on July 2, they were then transferred to the command of General William H. Emory, under whom they provided support for General John Pope's army at Yorktown and received heavy artillery training, beginning August 20. The 52nd Pennsylvania was then ordered south for duty in the Carolinas.Bates, pp. 54-55.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 79-91, 102-103. Packing up their equipment at Yorktown, the 52nd Pennsylvanians boarded the USS Georgia on December 29. Departing aboard that steamer, they then slowed to pick up officers from the 52nd who were traveling aboard the mailboat Thomas Morgan and a tug. Realizing that their steamer was not suitable for an ocean trip, the regiment's commanding officer then directed the boat to stop at Fort Monroe, where he telegraphed Baltimore to secure a more seaworthy vessel. Boarding the USS Expounder (formerly known as the Daniel Webster), the regiment then departed for the Carolinas on New Year's Eve, and reached Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina on January 2, 1863.Mott, pp. 102-111. =1863= Attached to the U.S. Army's Department of the South, the 52nd Pennsylvania was next ordered to Port Royal, South Carolina, and sailed for that city on January 29, 1863. Landing at St. Helena Island on February 10, they made camp, and remained there until April 4, when they were ordered to board the bark, Milton, and head south for the Edisto River, but after two collisions with two different vessels and then receiving word that Union troops at Beaufort, South Carolina needed support, they turned around, and arrived there in mid-April. That journey turned out to be part of an unsuccessful Union attack on Charleston.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 111-114, pp. 122-124. Remaining at Beaufort, South Carolina from mid-April to July 5, the 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers were next ordered to Folly Island. In preparation for the Union Army's bombardment of Morris Island, the 52nd Pennsylvanians were then sent up the Stono River with members of the 104th Pennsylvania to create a diversion. Naval support from the Nantucket enabled them to land on James Island, but shortly thereafter, they were ambushed by enemy troops while on a causeway. Halting their march until daylight, they were able to drive the CSA pickets and their cavalry support back to Secessionville. The diversionary tactic successful, the main Union force was able to secure control of the land on Morris Island up to Fort Wagner. Additional Union infantrymen and an artillery battery were then sent to reinforce the 52nd and 104th Pennsylvania on James Island. In response to shelling of the Union gunboat Pawnee and James Island, the soldiers on James Island, with support from a newly arrived Connecticut battery, were able effect a retreat by the offending CSA forces but, upon determination by Union leaders that their troops on James Island were in an untenable position, those Union troops were ordered to withdraw. They did while covered by the 52nd Pennsylvania, which then also safely withdrew. Upon reaching Folly Island, the 52nd Pennsylvanians were on hand to witness the ill-fated, but intensely courageous, July 16, 1863 assault by the 54th Massachusetts on Fort Wagner, later recounted in the 1989 Academy Award- winning film, Glory. They then participated with other Union troops in the subsequent siege on the fort from mid-July through early September, at which point CSA troops abandoned the fort.Bates, pp. 55-58.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 126-142. On November 5, 1863, Captain John C. Dodge, Jr. resigned his commission. In December 1863, a significant number of men from the regiment then re-enlisted, were each awarded bounty of $400 and a 30-day veteran's furlough, and permitted to return home to Pennsylvania to visit family and friends. Taken by troop transport to Hilton Head, they then sailed for New York aboard the USS Arago; upon arrival, they boarded the train for Scranton, Pennsylvania. During this time, leaders of the regiment recruited new men to replace the fallen members of their ranks, and arranged to re-arm their troops with Springfield rifles in preparation for their continued service in South Carolina.Bates, p. 58. Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 148-149. =1864= As a New Year dawned, Lieutenant Colonel Henry M. Hoyt and Major John B. Conyngham of the 52nd Pennsylvania were advanced in rank, respectively, to colonel and lieutenant colonel on January 9, 1864. Captain Thomas B. Jayne, commanding officer of the 52nd's B Company, was also promoted. Transferred to the regiment's field and staff officer corps, he was commissioned as a major. Then, upon returning from their furloughs to Morris Island, South Carolina in early February 1864, the 52nd Pennsylvania Infantry was attached to the U.S. Army's X Corps (10th Corps) under the command of General Quincy A. Gilmore. Although initially ordered to join the Union forces gathered at Bermuda Hundred, Virginia, the powers that be in the U.S. Department of the South decided to keep them at Hilton Head, South Carolina. From this post, the 52nd Pennsylvanians were subsequently ordered to make periodic raids on South Carolina's Sea Islands, including one raid each at John's, Kiowa and Bull's.Bates, p. 58.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 148-149. On April 22, the 52nd Pennsylvania was then ordered to Hilton Head, where it remained until being ordered back to Folly Island on June 13.Mott, p. 150. On July 3, 1864, 125 men from the 52nd Pennsylvania, led by Colonel Henry M. Hoyt, attacked Fort Johnson on James Island, but the ill- fated assault suffered from poor execution by other participating Union troops of a strategic plan which had been badly designed by senior Union leaders. Finding themselves without their promised support and cut off from retreat, after having scaled a parapet and made it inside the fort, Hoyt and his detachment of 52nd Pennsylvanians were ultimately captured by CSA troops. The officers who became POWs were held at Macon before being transferred to Charleston, where they were at risk from friendly fire by Union troops stationed on Morris Island. The enlisted men who became POWs were sent to CSA prisons at Columbia and Florence, South Carolina and/or Andersonville, Georgia; more than 50 died before they could be freed. In addition, the regiment also sustained 23 casualties during the assault, including seven who were killed or mortally wounded in action (see \\"Casualties\\" below).Bates, pp. 59-60.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 151-161.\\"The History of Fort Johnson,\\" in \\"Marine Resources Center.\\" Columbia, South Carolina: Marine Resources Research Institute, South Carolina Department of Natural Resources, retrieved online July 9, 2018. Stationed on Morris Island during the summer and fall of 1864, the 52nd Pennsylvanians were assigned to heavy artillery duties during which they were directed to shell Charleston with rifled Parrott guns.Bates, p. 60.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117. =1865‚Äî1866= Assigned to the \\"boat infantry\\" during the winter of late 1864 and early 1865, according to Bates, this duty for the 52nd Pennsylvania Volunteers \\"was exceedingly difficult arduous,\\" and was, essentially, the equivalent of \\"picket duty upon the harbor.\\"Bates, p. 60.Fifty-Second Regiment, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117. > All through the long, blustering, wintry nights the men sat with muskets, > howitzers, and Requa batteries, peering across the iron-clad harbor; > collisions with the enemy's pickets were frequent. On February 5, 1865, the 52nd Pennsylvania's John A. Hennessy was advanced in rank in order to fill the leadership vacuum created when Major John Conyngham was imprisoned as a POW. The newly commissioned Major Hennessy then led an expedition to Fort Sumter on February 18, but found it deserted. After hoisting the regimental flag over the ruins (the first U.S. flag over the fort in nearly four years), the party continued into Charleston, entering the city before the Confederates had finished evacuating it.Bates, pp. 60-61.Fifty- Second Pennsylvania, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 167-173. Col. John B. Conyngham After the capture of the city, the 52nd Pennsylvania joined the army of General William Tecumseh Sherman, and engaged with that army in various operations across the South. As a result, the members of this regiment were present at the surrender of General Joseph E. Johnston at the Bennett Place near Raleigh, North Carolina.Bates, p. 61.Fifty-Second Pennsylvania, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117.Mott, pp. 176-183. Meanwhile, John B. Conyngham returned to his regiment. Having survived imprisonment as a POW, he was commissioned as a full colonel and made commanding officer of the 52nd Pennsylvania on June 3, 1865.Bates, p. 61. Finally, after serving for nearly the entire duration of the American Civil War, the 52nd Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers were permitted to return home to Pennsylvania where, on July 12, 1865, they honorably mustered out.Bates, p. 61.Fifty-Second Pennsylvania, History of Luzerne, Lackawanna and Wyoming Counties, p. 117. In 1866, Col. Henry M. Hoyt was recognized \\"for gallant and meritorious services, to date from March 12, 1865\\" via nomination by President Andrew Johnson and approval by the U.S. Senate for the rank of brigadier-general by brevet.\\"To Be Brigadier-Generals by Brevet\\", in \\"Brevet Appointments Confirmed.\\" Philadelphia, Pennsylvania: The Daily Evening Telegraph, February 26, 1866. Casualties The fatal chest wound sustained by Pvt. Henry King in the Battle of Fair Oaks was documented in his mother's Civil War pension file (U.S. National Archives/Fold3). The 52nd Pennsylvania incurred a number of casualties during its tenure of service, including men who were killed in action, mortally or severely wounded in battle and died later from those wounds, men injured so severely or made so ill by ailments contracted while in service that they were discharged on surgeons' certificates of disability, like Frank Charles Bunnell, and others who were wounded but were able to return to duty following medical treatment, as well as those who were declared missing in action, and/or who were captured and held as prisoners of war (POWs). At least one, Private William Moyer of C Company, was killed by friendly fire, while I Company's 1st Sergeant Benjamin Franklin Jones contracted tetanus after accidentally shooting himself in the hand while cleaning his rifle at the regiment's camp on Morris Island, South Carolina. Another member of the regiment, Porter Summers of B Company, was believed to have been killed by scalding water during a boiler explosion while serving on detached duty aboard the gunboat during the Battle of Saint Charles, Arkansas.\\"Civil War Widows' Pensions.\\" Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration and Fold3.com (subscription required), retrieved online July 8, 2018.

A native of Carbon County, Pennsylvania who was a druggist at the time of his enlistment with the 13th Pennsylvania Militia, he was captured on July 3, 1864, while serving with the 52nd Pennsylvania. Held initially at Fort Johnson in South Carolina, he was transported to the Confederate States Military Prison at Andersonville, Georgia on the Fourth of July. Held there for two months, he was then transferred to the CSA Military Prison at Florence, South Carolina (also known as the Florence Stockade). Held there until his release on March 1, 1865, he was then discharged honorably from his regiment by General Order on June 30, 1865, and sent home to Pennsylvania.

Tropical activity lasted for about six months from the middle of November 1995 to early May 1996. The first storm, Intense Tropical Cyclone Agnielle, formed in the adjacent Australian basin on November 16 and later reached peak winds in the south-west Indian Ocean. The next named storm after Agnielle was Bonita, which formed in early January and killed 42 people. The basin was most active in February, with two tropical cyclones, or the equivalent of a minimal hurricane, as well as a severe tropical storm. The first of these three was Doloresse, which killed 67 people due to a shipwreck in the Comoros. The next storm was Cyclone Edwige, which caused heavy crop damage on Mauritius before looping along the east coast of Madagascar. In March, both Cyclone Flossy and Tropical Storm Guylianne passed near the Mascarene Islands, producing heavy rainfall and gusty winds. Tropical activity continued through April and May, with two tropical cyclones in the former month. In early April, Tropical Cyclone Hansella moved over the island of Rodrigues, dropping more rainfall in 24 hours than the average monthly total. Later, Itelle became a rare April intense tropical cyclone, but weakened before it approached St. Brandon island. The final storm of the season, Jenna, formed in the Australian region, briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the south-west Indian Ocean, and proceeded to exit the basin on May 4 to end the season. In addition to the named storms, several tropical depressions were tracked, one of which in December dropped heavy rainfall on R√©union.

The agency estimated intensity through the Dvorak technique, and warned on tropical cyclones in the region from the coast of Africa to 90¬∞ E, south of the equator. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), which is a joint United States Navy ‚Äì United States Air Force task force, also issued tropical cyclone warnings for the southwestern Indian Ocean. The season was fairly active with ten tropical storms, one greater than average, although most storms were short-lived. Six of the storms reached tropical cyclone status, or maximum sustained winds of at least 120 km/h (75 mph), which is two more than average. Most cyclones dissipated within the tropics, in contrast to the norm of storms accelerating into higher latitudes. Throughout the season there were 82 days in which there was tropical activity. Based on a list contributed by the nation of Seychelles, the storms were named in sequential order, starting with Agnielle. The rest of the names on the list were Ketty, Lucia, Molly, Nadege, Odette, Paquerette, Rolina, Sylvianne, Talla, Vivienne, Walya, and Yoline. In addition to the named storms, the MFR tracked 11 tropical depressions or disturbances that did not intensify into a tropical storm. The agency did not issue any bulletins on eight of them. Of the remaining three, two formed in late December, and the other formed in mid- February. Tropical Depression B2, the longest-lasting of the depressions, formed after a month of activity. An area of convection developed in the Mozambique Channel, and the MFR believed it to be connected to the depression that formed on December 28 east of Madagascar. With a ridge to the east, the system tracked southward, but failed to intensify due to strong wind shear. While passing west of R√©union, the depression dropped heavy rainfall, totaling along the northern coast and about twice that amount in the mountainous interior. On December 31, the depression dissipated to the southwest of R√©union. On February 10, the JTWC tracked Tropical Cyclone 12S into the basin as a weakening tropical depression, which quickly dissipated. A few days later, the JTWC also tracked Tropical Cyclone 15S from February 14-17, which briefly intensified into a minimal tropical storm in the eastern portion of the basin. Systems =Intense Tropical Cyclone Daryl-Agnielle= In the middle of November 1995, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) spawned an area of convection to the southwest of the Indonesian island of Sumatra. Located within the Australian region in an area of low wind shear, a tropical low developed west of Sumatra on November 16\\\\. It gradually intensified while moving southward, before turning sharply westward on November 18 due to a ridge to the south. That day, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Perth upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Daryl, or to minimal tropical storm status. Designated Tropical Cyclone 01S by the JTWC, Daryl continued to intensify, and the BoM upgraded it to winds of 120 km/h (75 mph). The system crossed into the basin on November 19, and was renamed Daryl as Agnielle at that time. On November 20, the ridge to the south weakened, allowing Agnielle to turn to the southwest. A well-defined eye developed, which persisted for about three days. Late on November 20, Agnielle attained peak 10‚Äëminute sustained winds of 175 km/h (110 mph), making it an intense tropical cyclone, a rarity for November storms. On November 21, the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 280 km/h (175 mph), the second-strongest storm estimated by the agency in the Indian Ocean, after only Cyclone Fantala. Although the eye briefly became less organized, accompanied by a decrease in winds, Agnielle re-intensified despite moving over colder waters. The ridge to the south rebuilt, forcing the cyclone to slow and turn to the west. Increasing wind shear caused rapid weakening; within 30 hours, the winds decreased from tropical cyclone to tropical depression status on November 25\\\\. That day, the JTWC discontinued advisories, although the MFR continued tracking the circulation until Agnielle's dissipation on November 27. =Intense Tropical Cyclone Bonita= As Tropical Depression B2 was dissipating near R√©union, another tropical depression formed east of the Chagos Archipelago on January 3\\\\. It moved southwestward, initially without development, but conditions gradually became more favorable. On January 5, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Bonita, and three days later reached tropical cyclone status as it developed a well-defined eye. Later that day, Bonita quickly intensified to its 10‚Äëminute peak intensity of 185 km/h (115 mph), making it the strongest storm of the season. A ridge to the south turned the cyclone more to the west. On January 9, the JTWC estimated Bonita attained peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 250 km/h (155 mph), and the next day, the cyclone made landfall about 50 km (30 mi) north of Foulpointe in eastern Madagascar. Bonita quickly weakened into a tropical storm while crossing the country, but re- intensified slightly after reaching the Mozambique Channel on January 12\\\\. Late on January 13, Bonita made a second landfall in eastern Mozambique between Pebane and Quelimane. Although the MFR ceased issuing advisories on January 15, the remnants of Bonita continued across Africa, and emerging into the southern Atlantic Ocean on January 19 and dissipating the next day. Bonita was considered by the Zambia Meteorological Department to have been the first tropical cyclone known to have traversed southern Africa from the South-West Indian Ocean to the South Atlantic. In eastern Madagascar, 24‚Äëhour rainfall totals included at Toamasina, while gusts exceeded on the offshore island of √éle Sainte-Marie. Bonita caused widespread flooding of rice crops, as well as heavy infrastructure and crop damage along the northeastern coastline. The cyclone killed 25 people in Madagascar and left 5,000 people homeless. In Mozambique, Bonita dropped heavy rainfall and produced flooding, killing as many as 17 people. Floodwaters destroyed of crops and demolished many buildings, including about 12 schools. The remnants of Bonita dropped the heaviest rainfall in 80 years in eastern Zimbabwe, and heavy rainfall also spread into Zambia. =Severe Tropical Storm Hubert-Coryna= In the Australian basin, the monsoon trough spawned a tropical disturbance near Christmas Island on January 3\\\\. With a ridge to the south, the system tracked to the west-southwest, developing into a tropical low on January 6 and being named Hubert the next day by the BoM. It quickly intensified to reach peak 10‚Äëminutes winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) on January 9 to the north of the Cocos Islands, but later that day began weakening due to increasing wind shear. At around 1800 UTC on January 9, Hubert crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean with 10‚Äëminute winds of 100 km/h (65 mph), and at that time, was renamed the cyclone Coryna. The wind shear quickly tore the convection away from the center, leaving the circulation exposed by January 10\\\\. The next day, Coryna weakened to tropical depression status, and on January 12 the circulation dissipated in the central Indian Ocean. =Severe Tropical Storm Doloresse= After about a month in which there were no named storms in the basin, a tropical disturbance formed within the ITCZ to the southwest of Seychelles on February 12\\\\. It moved slowly to the southwest with a well-defined center and a broad area of convection. For several days, the system remained weak until reaching more favorable conditions on February 16, and the next day it intensified into Tropical Storm Doloresse. The storm slowed while reaching the western extent of a ridge, drifting for nearly 24 hours about north-northwest of Grande Comore. On February 17, an approaching trough turned Doloresse to the south-southeast, bringing the storm about 55 km (35 mi) southwest of Grande Comore; this made it the first cyclone to directly affect the nation since Cyclone Elinah 13 years prior. On February 17, the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 140 km/h (85 mph), and on the next day, the MFR estimated peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 95 km/h (60 mph). Increasing shear caused Doloresse to rapidly weaken to tropical depression status on February 19\\\\. Although the JTWC assessed the storm as continuing to the southeast and striking northwestern Madagascar, the MFR estimated the system turned to a southwest drift and dissipated on February 20. In the Comoros, Doloresse produced strong wind gusts, damaging crops and houses on Grande Comore. Heavy rainfall caused landslides, and the cyclone caused a shipwreck, killing 67 people on the island of Moh√©li. The western periphery of the circulation dropped heavy rainfall in Tanzania. =Tropical Cyclone Edwige= On February 18, a tropical disturbance began forming about southwest of Diego Garcia, becoming a tropical depression the next day. A trough steered the new system to the southeast, but also prevented significant strengthening due to wind shear. Late on February 21, the MFR upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Edwige, and the next day the JTWC began tracking it as Tropical Cyclone 16S. When the trough weakened, Edwige turned to the south and later southwest, reaching an initial peak of 75 km/h (50 mph) on February 23. That day, increasing wind shear caused the storm to weaken to minimal tropical storm status, and the JTWC briefly discontinued advisories on February 24\\\\. The strengthening ridge caused Edwige to accelerate to the west, bringing it south of Rodrigues without any effects on February 24\\\\. On the next day, the storm passed north of Mauritius and R√©union, where it produced wind gusts of and , respectively, as well as heavy rainfall. Due to crop damage caused by Edwige, as well as a drought later in the year, Mauritius failed to reach its quota for sugar outputs. After passing north of R√©union, Edwige began reintensifying due to decreasing wind shear, and the JTWC reissued advisories on February 25. With warm waters, the storm developed increasing outflow as well as an eye. On February 26, Edwige intensified into a tropical cyclone and reached peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph) while approaching eastern Madagascar. On the same day, the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). For unknown reasons, Edwige executed a counterclockwise loop along the Malagasy coast near Mananjary. Due to land interaction, the cyclone rapidly weakened and turned to the north-northeast off the coast, although the JTWC assessed the storm as turning inland again. On February 29, Edwige dissipated just off the coast of Toamasina. The storm dropped of rainfall in Mananjary, with wind gusts of , but damage was limited. =Tropical Cyclone Flossy= On February 25, a tropical disturbance developed along a cold front about south-southeast of Diego Garcia. With a ridge to the south, the system tracked southwestward and intensified into Tropical Storm Flossy on February 27. That day, the JTWC began issuing advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17S. The storm quickly developed an eye, intensifying to tropical cyclone status on February 28. That day, the MFR estimated peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 150 km/h (90 mph), while the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 215 km/h (130 mph). Late on February 29, Flossy passed about northwest of Rodrigues, producing wind gusts of there. Increased wind shear weakened Flossy, beginning on March 1, although the storm restrengthened slightly on March 2\\\\. That day, the cyclone rounded the ridge and turned to the south and southeast, and weakened again due to an approaching cold front. On March 4, Flossy became extratropical after all of the convection was sheared away from the circulation. Two days later, the front absorbed the remnants of Flossy. =Moderate Tropical Storm Guylianne= The ITCZ spawned a tropical disturbance on March 17 about south of Diego Garcia. Due to ongoing wind shear, the system initially failed to intensify while moving westward. An approaching cold front turned the disturbance southward on March 20 into an area of low wind shear, allowing the convection to increase and for the system to be upgraded to tropical depression status. While the system was moving toward Mauritius on March 22, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Guylianne. Later that night, the storm passed about east of Mauritius, bringing beneficial rainfall. Both MFR and JTWC only estimated peak winds of 65 km/h (40 mph), and Guylianne began weakening on March 23 due to increased wind shear. The storm turned to a southwest drift, dissipating on March 25. =Tropical Cyclone Hansella= Toward the end of March, the ITCZ was active with several low pressure areas, and an area of convection consolidated south of the Chagos Archipelago in early April. On April 2, a large tropical disturbance formed, and the next day, it was named Hansella despite only being a tropical depression. The system moved westward initially, but curved southward on April 4 due to a trough, by which time it had intensified into a tropical storm. After developing a wide eye, Hansella intensified to tropical cyclone status on April 6 and moved over Rodrigues. Gusts on the island reached , which caused heavy damage to crops and houses. Hansella dropped of rainfall on Rodrigues in a 24‚Äëhour period, greater than the island's monthly average total. According to the MFR, Hansella failed to intensify beyond 10‚Äëminute winds of 120 km/h (75 mph), although the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph). The cyclone looped to the west after passing over Rodrigues, influenced by a building ridge to the south. Due to upwelling after moving slowly over the same waters, Hansella weakened quickly and passed about south of Rodrigues as a minimal tropical storm. On April 9, the storm passed just south of Mauritius, and the next day spawned a large area of convection over R√©union, dropping heavy rainfall. On April 10, Hansella dissipated just northwest of R√©union. =Intense Tropical Cyclone Itelle= A low-pressure area persisted east-southeast of Diego Garcia on April 6, developing into a tropical disturbance that day. With a ridge to the south, the system moved generally westward, slowly intensifying. Convection gradually increased, and the system intensified into Tropical Storm Itelle on April 9\\\\. An eye developed the next day, signaling that the storm had strengthened into a tropical cyclone as it turned more to the west- southwest. Developing a large wide eye, Itelle intensified further, and the MFR estimated peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 175 km/h (110 mph) on April 12\\\\. This made it an unusual April intense tropical cyclone. On April 14, the JTWC estimated peak 1‚Äëminute winds of 260 km/h (160 mph), equivalent to a Category 5 on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale. That day, increasing wind shear weakened Itelle, and the cyclone was downgraded to severe tropical storm status by April 15 when it passed about south of St. Brandon. Wind gusts on the island reached . Itelle slowed on April 16 while passing about north of R√©union, which was followed by increased shear and weakening. On April 19, Itelle dissipated about east of the eastern Madagascar coastline. =Moderate Tropical Storm Jenna= In early May, a westerly wind burst associated with the Madden‚ÄìJulian oscillation produced disturbances on both sides of the equator in the eastern Indian Ocean. The BoM estimated that a tropical low formed west of Sumatra at the low latitude of 4.8¬∞ S, near the boundary between the Australian and the south-west Indian basins; this caused difficulty with regard to tropical cyclone warnings. On May 3, the JTWC upgraded the system to tropical storm status. On the next day, the low crossed into the south-west Indian Ocean, intensifying into Tropical Storm Jenna. The MFR estimated peak 10‚Äëminute winds of 85 km/h (50 mph) on May 5\\\\. Soon after, an approaching trough turned the storm to the southeast, bringing Jenna back into the Australian region, and absorbing the storm on May 6.

The name is one of convenience, as throughout this period the elite and populace of the Kingdom were predominantly Pictish-Gaels or later Pictish-Gaels and Scoto-Norman, and differs markedly from the period of the Stuarts, in which the elite of the kingdom were (for the most part) speakers of Middle English, which later evolved and came to be called Lowland Scots. There is no precise Gaelic equivalent for the English terminology \\"Kingdom of Alba\\", as the Gaelic term R√¨oghachd na h-Alba means 'Kingdom of Scotland'. English-speaking scholars adapted the Gaelic name for Scotland to apply to a particular political period in Scottish history during the High Middle Ages. Royal court Little is known about the structure of the Scottish royal court in the period before the coming of the Normans to Scotland, before the reign of David I. A little more is known about the court of the later 12th and 13th centuries. In the words of Geoffrey Barrow, this court \\"was emphatically feudal, Frankish, non-Celtic in character\\".Barrow, Robert Bruce, (1998), p. 7. Some of the offices were Gaelic in origin, such as the Hostarius (later Usher or \\"Doorward\\"), the man in charge of the royal bodyguard, and the rannaire, the Gaelic-speaking member of the court whose job was to divide the food.Barrow, Kingship and Unity, p. 34. *The Seneschal or dapifer (i.e. the Steward), had been hereditary since the reign of David I. The Steward had responsibility for the royal household and its management. (see High Steward of Scotland). *The Chancellor was in charge of the royal chapel. The latter was the king's place of worship, but as it happened, was associated with the royal scribes, responsible for keeping records. Usually, the chancellor was a clergyman, and usually he held this office before being promoted to a bishopric (see Lord Chancellor of Scotland). *The Chamberlain had control and responsibility over royal finances (see Chamberlain of Scotland) *The Constable was also hereditary since the reign of David I and was in charge of the crown's military resources (see Lord High Constable of Scotland). *The Butler (see Butler of Scotland) *The Marshal or marischal. The marischal differed from the constable in that he was more specialised, responsible for and in charge of the royal cavalry forces (see Earl Marischal) In the 13th century, all the other offices tended to be hereditary, with the exception of the Chancellor. The royal household of course came with numerous other offices. The most important was probably the aforementioned hostarius, but there were others such as the royal hunters, the royal foresters and the cooks (dispensa or spence). Kings of Alba =Donald II and Constantine II= King Donald II was the first man to have been called r√≠ Alban (i.e. King of Alba), when he died at Dunnottar in 900.AU, s.a. 900; A.O. Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 395 This meant king of Caledonia or Scotland. All his predecessors bore the style of either King of the Picts or King of Fortriu. Such an apparent innovation in the Gaelic chronicles is occasionally taken to spell the birth of Scotland, but there is nothing special about his reign that might confirm this. Donald had the nickname d√°sachtach. This simply meant a madman, or in early Irish law, a man not in control of his functions and hence without legal culpability.Kelly, Early Irish Law, (1998), p.92. The reason was possibly the restlessness of his reign, continually spent fighting battles against Vikings. It is possible he gained his unpopularity by violating the rights of the church or through high taxes, but it is not known for certain. However, his extremely negative nickname makes him an unlikely founder of Scotland. Donald's successor Constantine II (Causant√≠n mac Aeda) is more often regarded as a key figure in the formation of Alba.e.g. BBC documentary In Search of Scotland, ep. 2. Constantine reigned for nearly half a century, fighting many battles. When he lost at Brunanburh, he was clearly discredited and retired as a Culdee monk at St. Andrews. Despite this, the Prophecy of Berch√°n is full of praise for the king, and in this respect is in line with the views of other sources. Constantine is credited in later tradition as the man who, with bishop Ceallach of St Andrews, brought the Catholic Church in Scotland into conformity with that of the larger Gaelic world, although it is not known exactly what this means. There had been Gaelic bishops in St Andrews for two centuries, and Gaelic churchmen were amongst the oldest features of Caledonian Christianity. The reform may have been organizational, or some sort of purge of certain unknown and perhaps disliked legacies of Pictish ecclesiastical tradition. However, other than these factors, it is difficult to appreciate fully the importance of Constantine's reign. =Malcolm I to Malcolm II= The period between the accession of Malcolm I (Maol Caluim Mac Domhnuill) and Malcolm II (Maol Caluim Mac Cionaodha) is marked by good relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and, despite this, relatively successful expansionary policies. Some time after an English invasion of cumbra land (Old English for either Strathclyde or Cumbria or both) by King Edmund of England in 945, the English king handed the province over to king Malcolm I on condition of a permanent alliance. Some time in the reign of King Indulf (Idulb mac Causant√≠n) (954‚Äì62), the Scots captured the fortress called oppidum Eden, i.e. almost certainly Edinburgh.Hudson, Celtic Kings, (1994), p. 89 It was the first Scottish foothold in Lothian. The Scots had probably had some authority in Strathclyde since the later part of the 9th century, but the kingdom kept its own rulers, and it is not clear that the Scots were always strong enough to enforce their authority. In fact, one of Indulf's successors, Cuil√©n (Cuil√©n mac Ilduilbh), died at the hands of the men of Strathclyde, perhaps while trying to enforce his authority. King Kenneth II (Cionaodh Mac Maol Chaluim) (971‚Äì95) began his reign by invading Britannia (possibly Strathclyde), perhaps as an early assertion of his authority, and perhaps also as a traditional Gaelic crechr√≠ghe (lit. \\"royal prey\\"), the rite by which a king secured the success of his reign with an inauguration raid in the territory of a historical enemy.Hudson, Celtic Kings, (1994), pp. 95‚Äì6 The reign of Malcolm I (942/3‚Äì954) also marks the first known tensions between the Scottish kingdom and Moray, the old heartland of the Scoto-Pictish kingdom of Fortriu. The Chronicle of the Kings of Alba reported that King Malcolm \\"went into Moray and slew Ceallach.\\" The same source tells us that King Malcolm was killed by the Moravians.A.O. Anderson, Early Sources, vol. i, p. 452. This is the first definite sign of tension between the Cen√©l nGabr√°in and Cen√©l Loairn, two kin-groups claiming descent from different ancestors of Erc. During the reign of Macbeth (Mac Beathadh Mac Findl√°ich), and his successor Lulach (Lulach Mac Gille Comhgh√°in), the Moray-based Cen√©l Loairn ruled all Scotland. The reign of Malcolm II saw the final incorporation of these territories. The critical year perhaps was 1018, when King Malcolm II defeated the Northumbrians at the Battle of Carham. In the same year, King Owain Foel died, leaving his kingdom to his overlord Malcolm. A meeting with King Canute of Denmark and England, probably about 1031, seems to have further secured these conquests, although the exact nature of Scottish rule over the Lothian and Scottish Borders area was not fully realised until the conquest and annexation of that province during the Wars of Independence. =Duncan I to Alexander I= The Stone of Scone in the Coronation Chair at Westminster Abbey, 1855. It was the ceremonial coronation stone of Scotland's Gaelic kings, similar to the Irish Lia F√°il. The period between the accession of King Duncan I (Donnchadh Mac Cr√≠on√°in) (1034) and the death of Alexander I (1124) was the last before the coming of the Normans to Scotland. In some respects, the reign of King Malcolm III (Maol Caluim Mac Donnchaidh) prefigured the changes which took place in the reigns of the French-speaking kings David I and William I, although native reaction to the manner of Duncan II's (Donnchad mac M√°el Coluim) accession perhaps put these changes back somewhat. King Duncan I's reign was a military failure. He was defeated by the native English at Durham in 1040, and was subsequently toppled. Duncan had only been related to previous rulers through his mother Bethoc, daughter of Malcolm II, who had married Cr√≠n√°n, the lay abbot of Dunkeld (and probably Mormaer of Atholl too). At a location called Bothganowan (or Bothgowan, Bothgofnane, Bothgofuane, meaning \\"Blacksmith's Hut\\" in old Gaelic,Historical Sources of Macbeth. today Pitgaveny near Elgin), the Mormaer of Moray, Macbeth defeated and killed Duncan, and took the kingship for himself.Hudson, Celtic Kings, p. 124. After Macbeth's successor Lulach, another Moravian, all kings of Scotland were Duncan's descendants. For this reason, Duncan's reign is often remembered positively, while Macbeth is villanised. Eventually, William Shakespeare gave fame to this medieval equivalent of propaganda by further immortalising both men in his play Macbeth. Macbeth's reign however was successful enough that he had the security to go on pilgrimage to Rome. It was Malcolm III who acquired the nickname (as did his successors) \\"Canmore\\" (Ceann M√≥r, \\"Great Chief\\"), and not his father Duncan, who did more to create the successful dynasty which ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Part of the success was the huge number of children he had. Through two marriages, firstly to the Norwegian Ingibiorg Finnsdottir, and secondly to the English princess Margaret of Wessex, Malcolm had perhaps a dozen children. Malcolm and, if we believe later hagiography, his wife, introduced the first Benedictine monks to Scotland. However, despite having a royal Anglo-Saxon wife, Malcolm spent more of his reign conducting slave raids against the English, adding to the woes of that people in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest of England and the Harrying of the North, as Marianus Scotus tells us: > the Scots and French devastated the English; and [the English] were > dispersed and died of hunger; and were compelled to eat human flesh: and to > this end, to kill men, and to salt and dry them.‚ÄùA.O. Anderson, Early > Sources, vol. ii, p. 23, & n. 1. Malcolm died in one of these raids, in 1093. In the aftermath of his death, the Norman rulers of England began their interference in the Scottish kingdom. This interference was prompted by Malcolm's raids and attempts to forge claims for his successors to the English kingship. He had married the sister of the native English claimant to the English throne, Edgar √Ütheling, and had given most of his children by this marriage Anglo-Saxon royal names. Moreover, he had given support to many native English nobles, including Edgar himself, and had been supporting native English insurrections against their Norman rulers. In 1080, King William the Conqueror sent his son on an invasion of Scotland. The invasion got as far as Falkirk, on the boundary between Scotland-proper and Lothian, and Malcolm submitted to the authority of the king, giving his oldest son Duncan as a hostage. This submission perhaps gives the reason why Malcolm did not give his last two sons, Alexander and David, Anglo-Saxon royal names. Malcolm's natural successor was his brother, Donalbane (Domhnall B√°n Mac Donnchaidh), as Malcolm's sons were young. However, the Norman state to the south sent Malcolm's son Duncan to take the kingship. In the ensuing conflict, the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle tells us that: > Donnchadh went to Scotland with what aid he could get of the English and > French, and deprived his kinsman Domhnall of the Kingdom, and was received > as King. But afterwards some of the Scots gathered themselves together, and > slew almost all of his followers; and he himself escaped with few. > Thereafter they were reconciled on the condition that he should never again > introduce English or French into the land‚Äù Duncan was killed the same year, 1094, and Donalbane resumed sole kingship. However, the Norman state sent another of Malcolm's sons, Edgar to take the kingship. Anglo-Norman policy worked, because thereafter all kings of Scotland succeeded, not without opposition of course, under a system very closely corresponding with the primogeniture that operated in the French-speaking world. The reigns of both Edgar and his brother and successor Alexander are comparatively obscure. The former's most notable act was to send a camel (or perhaps an elephant) to his fellow Gael Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland.Annals of Inisfallen, s.a. 1105-1107/7, available here; When Edgar died, Alexander took the kingship, while his youngest brother David became Prince of \\"Cumbria\\" and ruler of Lothian. =Norman Kings: David I to Alexander III= Book of Deer, folio 29v contains a portrait of the Evangelist Luke; a list of privileges and legends were written in Gaelic and Latin in the margins, in lowland Buchan in the reign of David I. The period between the accession of David I and the death of Alexander III was marked by dependence upon, and relatively good relations with, the Kings of the English. It was also a period of historical expansion for the Scottish kingdom, and witnessed the successful imposition of royal authority across most of the modern country. The period was one of a great deal of historical change, and much of the modern historiographical literature is devoted to this change (especially G.W.S. Barrow), part of a more general phenomenon which has been called the \\"Europeanisation of Europe\\".Bartlett, The Making of Europe (1993). More recent works though, while acknowledging that a great deal of change did take place, emphasise that this period was in fact also one of great continuity (e.g. Cynthia Neville, Richard Oram, Dauvit Broun, and others). Indeed, the period is subject to many misconceptions. For instance, English did not spread all over the Lowlands (see language section), and neither did English names; and, moreover even by 1300, most native lordships remained in native Gaelic hands, with only a minority passing to men of French or Anglo-French origin; furthermore, the Normanisation and imposition of royal authority in Scotland was not a peaceful process, but in fact cumulatively more violent than the Norman Conquest of England; additionally, the Scottish kings were not independent monarchs, but vassals to the King of the English, although not \\"legally\\" for Scotland north of the Forth. The important changes which did occur include the extensive establishment of burghs (see section), in many respects Scotland's first urban institutions; the feudalisation, or more accurately, the Francization of aristocratic martial, social and inheritance customs; the de-Scotticisation of ecclesiastical institutions; the imposition of royal authority over most of modern Scotland; and the drastic drift at the top level from traditional Gaelic culture, so that after David I, the Kingship of the Scots resembled more closely the kingship of the French and English, than it did the lordship of any large-scale Gaelic kingdom in Ireland. After David I, and especially in the reign of William I, Scotland's kings became ambivalent about, if not hostile towards, the culture of most of their subjects. As Walter of Coventry tells us: > The modern kings of Scotia count themselves as Frenchmen, in race, manners, > language and culture; they keep only Frenchmen in their household and > following, and have reduced the Scots [=Gaels north of the Forth] to utter > servitudeMemoriale Fratris Walteri de Coventria, ed. W. Stubbs, (Rolls > Series, no. 58), ii. 206. The ambivalence of the kings was matched to a certain extent by their subjects. In the aftermath of William's capture at Alnwick in 1174, the Scots turned on their king's English-speaking and French-speaking subjects. William of Newburgh related the events: > When [King William] was given over into the hands of the enemy, God's > vengeance permitted not also that his most evil army should go away unhurt. > For when they learned of the King's capture the barbarians at first were > stunned, and desisted from spoil; and presently, as if driven by furies, the > sword which they had taken up against their enemy and which was now drunken > with innocent blood they turned against their own army. > Now there was in the same army a great number of English; for the towns and > burghs of the Scottish realm are known to be inhabited by English. On the > occasion therefore of this opportunity the Scots declared their hatred > against them, innate, though masked through fear of the king; and as many as > they fell upon they slew, the rest who could escape fleeing back to the > royal castlesWilliam of Newburgh, Historia Rerum Anglicarum, in R. Howlett > (ed.) Chronicles of Stephen, Henry II and Richard I, (Rolls Series, no. 82), > Vol. I, pp 186-187. Walter Bower, writing a few centuries later albeit, wrote about the same event: > At that time after the capture of their king, the Scots together with the > Galwegians, in the mutual slaughter that took place, killed their English > and French compatriots without mercy or pity, making frequent attacks on > them. At that time also there took place a most wretched and widespread > persecution of the English both in Scotland and Galloway. So intense was it > that no consideration was shown to the sex of any, but all were cruelly > killed ...Walter Bower, Scottichronicon, VIII. 22., 30-40. Opposition to the Scottish kings in this period was indeed hard. The first instance is perhaps the revolt of √ìengus of Moray, the Mormaer of Moray, the crushing of which led to the colonisation of Moray by foreign burgesses, and Franco-Flemish and Anglo-French aristocrats. Rebellions continued throughout the 12th century and into the 13th. Important resistors to the expansionary Scottish kings were Somhairle Mac Gille Brighdhe, Fergus of Galloway, Gille Brigte of Galloway and Harald Maddadsson, along with two kin-groups known today as the MacHeths and the Meic Uilleim. The latter claimed descent from king Donnchadh II, through his son William, and rebelled for no less a reason than the Scottish throne itself. The threat was so grave that, after the defeat of the MacWilliams in 1230, the Scottish crown ordered the public execution of the baby girl who happened to be the last MacWilliam. This was how the Lanercost Chronicle relates the fate of this last MacWilliam: > the same Mac-William's daughter, who had not long left her mother's womb, > innocent as she was, was put to death, in the burgh of Forfar, in view of > the market place, after a proclamation by the public crier. Her head was > struck against the column of the market cross, and her brains dashed > outChronicle of Lanercost, 40-1, quoted in McDonald, Outlaws, p. 46. Many of these resistors collaborated, and drew support not just in the peripheral Gaelic regions of Galloway, Moray, Ross and Argyll, but also from eastern \\"Scotland-proper\\", Ireland and Mann. By the end of the 12th century, the Scottish kings had acquired the authority and ability to draw in native Gaelic lords outside their previous zone of control to do their work, the most famous examples being Lochlann, Lord of Galloway and Fearchar Mac an t-Sagairt. Such accommodation assisted expansion to the Scandinavian-ruled lands of the west. Uilleam, the native Mormaer of Ross, was a pivotal figure in the expansion of the Scottish kingdom into the Hebrides, as was Ail√©an mac Ruaidhr√≠, the key pro-Scottish Hebridean chief, who married his daughter to Uilleam, the Mormaer of Mar. The Scottish king was able to draw on the support of Alan, Lord of Galloway, the master of the Irish Sea region, and was able to make use of the Galwegian ruler's enormous fleet of ships. The Mormaers of Lennox forged links with the Argyll chieftains, bringing a kin-group such as the Campbells into the Scottish fold. Cumulatively, by the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a strong position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did in 1266, with the Treaty of Perth. Orkney too was coming into the Scottish fold. In the 12th century, Mormaer Matad's son Harald was established on the Orkney Earldom. Thereafter, the Orkney earl (also Mormaer of Caithness) was just as much a Scottish vassal as a Norwegian one. Descendants of the Gaelic Mormaers of Angus ruled Orkney for much of the 13th century. In the early 14th century, another Scottish Gaelic noble, Maol √çosa V of Strathearn became Earl of Orkney, although formal Scottish sovereignty over the Northern Isles did not come for more than another century. The conquest of the west, the creation of the Mormaerdom of Carrick in 1186 and the absorption of the Lordship of Galloway after the Galwegian revolt of 1135 meant that the number and proportion of Gaelic speakers under the rule of the Scottish king actually increased, and perhaps even doubled, in the so-called Norman period. It was the Gaels and Gaelicised warriors of the new west, and the power they offered, that enabled King Robert I (himself a Gaelicised Scoto-Norman of Carrick) to emerge victorious during the Wars of Independence, which followed soon after the death of Alexander III.

From the fifth century northern Britain was divided into a series of petty kingdoms. Of these the four most important to emerge were the Picts, the Gaels of D√°l Riata, the Britons of Strathclyde and the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia, later taken over by Northumbria. After the arrival of the Vikings in the late eighth century, Scandinavian rulers and colonies were established along parts of the coasts and in the islands. In the ninth century the Scots and Picts combined under the House of Alpin to form a single Kingdom of Alba, with a Pictish base and dominated by Gaelic culture. After the reign of King David I in the twelfth century, the Scottish monarchs are best described as Scoto-Norman, preferring French culture to native Scottish culture. Alexander II and his son Alexander III, were able to regain the remainder of the western seaboard, cumulating the Treaty of Perth with Norway in 1266. After being invaded and briefly occupied, Scotland re- established its independence from England under figures including William Wallace in the late thirteenth century and Robert Bruce in the fourteenth century. In the fifteenth century under the Stewart Dynasty, despite a turbulent political history, the crown gained greater political control at the expense of independent lords and regained most of its lost territory to approximately the modern borders of the country. However, the Auld Alliance with France led to the heavy defeat of a Scottish army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513 and the death of the king James IV, which would be followed by a long minority and a period of political instability. Kingship was the major form of government, growing in sophistication in the late Middle Ages. The scale and nature of war also changed, with larger armies, naval forces and the development of artillery and fortifications. The Church in Scotland always accepted papal authority (contrary to the implications of Celtic Christianity), introduced monasticism, and from the eleventh century embraced monastic reform, developing a flourishing religious culture that asserted its independence from English control. Scotland grew from its base in the eastern Lowlands, to approximately its modern borders. The varied and dramatic geography of the land provided a protection against invasion, but limited central control. It also defined the largely pastoral economy, with the first burghs being created from the twelfth century. The population may have grown to a peak of a million before the arrival of the Black Death in 1350. In the early Middle Ages society was divided between a small aristocracy and larger numbers of freemen and slaves. Serfdom disappeared in the fourteenth century and there was a growth of new social groups. The Pictish and Cumbric languages were replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse, with Gaelic emerging as the major cultural language. From the eleventh century French was adopted in the court and in the late Middle Ages, Scots, derived from Old English, became dominant, with Gaelic largely confined to the Highlands. Christianity brought Latin, written culture and monasteries as centres of learning. From the twelfth century, educational opportunities widened and a growth of lay education cumulated in the Education Act 1496. Until in the fifteenth century, when Scotland gained three universities, Scots pursuing higher education had to travel to England or the continent, where some gained an international reputation. Literature survives in all the major languages present in the early Middle Ages, with Scots emerging as a major literary language from John Barbour's Brus (1375), developing a culture of poetry by court makars, and later major works of prose. Art from the early Middle Ages survives in carving, in metalwork, and elaborate illuminated books, which contributed to the development of the wider insular style. Much of the finest later work has not survived, but there are a few key examples, particularly of work commissioned in the Netherlands. Scotland had a musical tradition, with secular music composed and performed by bards and from the thirteenth century, church music increasingly influenced by continental and English forms. Political history =Early Middle Ages= Minor kingdoms Major political centres in early Medieval Scotland In the centuries after the departure of the Romans from Britain, four major circles of influence emerged within the borders of what is now Scotland. In the east were the Picts, whose kingdoms eventually stretched from the river Forth to Shetland. The first identifiable king to have exerted a superior and wide-ranging authority, was Bridei mac Maelchon (r. c. 550‚Äì84), whose power was based in the Kingdom of Fidach and his base was at the fort of Craig Phadrig near modern Inverness.J. Haywood, The Celts: Bronze Age to New Age (London: Pearson Education, 2004), , p. 116. After his death leadership seems to have shifted to the Fortriu, whose lands were centred on Strathearn and Menteith and who raided along the eastern coast into modern England. Christian missionaries from Iona appear to have begun the conversion of the Picts to Christianity from 563. In the west were the Gaelic (Goidelic)-speaking people of D√°l Riata with their royal fortress at Dunadd in Argyll, with close links with the island of Ireland, from which they brought with them the name Scots. In 563 a mission from Ireland under St. Columba founded the monastery of Iona off the west coast of Scotland and probably began the conversion of the region to Christianity.A. P. Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80‚Äì1000 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 43‚Äì6. The kingdom reached its height under √Åed√°n mac Gabr√°in (r. 574‚Äì608), but its expansion was checked at the Battle of Degsastan in 603 by √Üthelfrith of Northumbria.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 57‚Äì67. In the south was the British (Brythonic) Kingdom of Strathclyde, descendants of the peoples of the Roman influenced kingdoms of \\"The Old North\\", often named Alt Clut, the Brythonic name for their capital at Dumbarton Rock. In 642, they defeated the men of D√°l Riata,A. Macquarrie, \\"The kings of Strathclyde, c. 400‚Äì1018\\", in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 8. but the kingdom suffered a number of attacks from the Picts, and later their Northumbrian allies, between 744 and 756.A. Williams and A. P. Smyth, eds, A Biographical Dictionary of Dark Age Britain: England, Scotland, and Wales, c. 500-c. 1050 (London: Routledge, 1991), , p. 106. After this, little is recorded until Alt Clut was burnt and probably destroyed in 780, although by whom and what in what circumstances is not known.A. Gibb, Glasgow, the Making of a City (London: Routledge, 1983), , p. 7. Finally, there were the English or \\"Angles\\", Germanic invaders who had overrun much of southern Britain and held the Kingdom of Bernicia, in the south-east.J. R. Maddicott and D. M. Palliser, eds, The Medieval State: Essays Presented to James Campbell (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 48. The first English king in the historical record is Ida, who is said to have obtained the throne and the kingdom about 547.B. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England (London: Routledge, 2002), , pp. 75‚Äì7. Ida's grandson, √Üthelfrith, united his kingdom with Deira to the south to form Northumbria around the year 604. There were changes of dynasty, and the kingdom was divided, but it was re-united under √Üthelfrith's son Oswald (r. 634‚Äì42), who had converted to Christianity while in exile in D√°l Riata and looked to Iona for missionaries to help convert his kingdom.B. Yorke, Kings and Kingdoms of Early Anglo-Saxon England (London: Routledge, 2002), , p. 78. Origins of the Kingdom of Alba Danish seamen, painted mid-twelfth century This situation was transformed in AD 793 when ferocious Viking raids began on monasteries like Iona and Lindisfarne, creating fear and confusion across the kingdoms of North Britain. Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles eventually fell to the Norsemen.W. E. Burns, A Brief History of Great Britain (Infobase Publishing, 2009), , pp. 44‚Äì5. The King of Fortriu, E√≥gan mac √ìengusa, and the King of D√°l Riata √Åed mac Boanta, were among the dead in a major defeat at the hands of the Vikings in 839.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 10. A mixture of Viking and Gaelic Irish settlement into south-west Scotland produced the Gall- Gaidel, the Norse Irish, from which the region gets the modern name Galloway.F. D. Logan, The Vikings in History (London, Routledge, 2nd edn., 1992), , p. 49. Sometime in the ninth century the beleaguered Kingdom of D√°l Riata lost the Hebrides to the Vikings, when Ketil Flatnose is said to have founded the Kingdom of the Isles.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 9. These threats may have speeded a long term process of gaelicisation of the Pictish kingdoms, which adopted Gaelic language and customs. There was also a merger of the Gaelic and Pictish crowns, although historians debate whether it was a Pictish takeover of D√°l Riata, or the other way around. This culminated in the rise of C√≠naed mac Ailp√≠n (Kenneth MacAlpin) in the 840s, which brought to power the House of Alpin.B. Yorke, The Conversion of Britain: Religion, Politics and Society in Britain c.600‚Äì800 (Pearson Education, 2006), , p. 54. In AD 867 the Vikings seized Northumbria, forming the Kingdom of York;D. W. Rollason, Northumbria, 500‚Äì1100: Creation and Destruction of a Kingdom (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , p. 212. three years later they stormed the Britons' fortress of DumbartonC. A. Snyder, The Britons (Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , p. 220. and subsequently conquered much of England except for a reduced Kingdom of Wessex, leaving the new combined Pictish and Gaelic kingdom almost encircled.J. Hearn, Claiming Scotland: National Identity and Liberal Culture (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2000), , p. 100. When he died as king of the combined kingdom in 900, Domnall II (Donald II) was the first man to be called r√≠ Alban (i.e. King of Alba).A. O. Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History, A.D. 500 to 1286 (General Books LLC, 2010), , vol. i, , p. 395. The term Scotia would be increasingly be used to describe the kingdom between North of the Forth and Clyde and eventually the entire area controlled by its kings would be referred to as Scotland.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , p. 22. =High Middle Ages= Gaelic kings: Constantine II to Alexander I Scotland from the Matthew Paris map, c. 1250 The long reign (900‚Äì942/3) of Causant√≠n (Constantine II) is often regarded as the key to formation of the Kingdom of Alba. He was later credited with bringing Scottish Christianity into conformity with the Catholic Church. After fighting many battles, his defeat at Brunanburh was followed by his retirement as a Culdee monk at St. Andrews.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 128. The period between the accession of his successor M√°el Coluim I (Malcolm I) and M√°el Coluim mac Cin√°eda (Malcolm II) was marked by good relations with the Wessex rulers of England, intense internal dynastic disunity and relatively successful expansionary policies. In 945, M√°el Coluim I annexed Strathclyde, where the kings of Alba had probably exercised some authority since the later ninth century, as part of an agreement with King Edmund of England.B. T. Hudson, Kings of Celtic Scotland (Westport: Greenhill 1994), , pp. 95‚Äì6. This event was offset by loss of control in Moray. The reign of King Donnchad I (Duncan I) from 1034 was marred by failed military adventures, and he was defeated and killed by Macbeth, the Mormaer of Moray, who became king in 1040.B. T. Hudson, Kings of Celtic Scotland (Westport: Greenhill 1994), , p. 124. MacBeth ruled for 17 years before he was overthrown by M√°el Coluim, the son of Donnchad, who some months later defeated Macbeth's step-son and successor Lulach to become king M√°el Coluim III (Malcolm III).J. D. Mackie, A History of Scotland (London: Pelican, 1964). p. 43. It was M√°el Coluim III, who acquired the nickname \\"Canmore\\" (Cenn M√≥r, \\"Great Chief\\"), which he passed to his successors and who did most to create the Dunkeld dynasty that ruled Scotland for the following two centuries. Particularly important was his second marriage to the Anglo- Hungarian princess Margaret.A. A. M. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1 (Edinburgh: Mercat Press,1989), p. 119. This marriage, and raids on northern England, prompted William the Conqueror to invade and M√°el Coluim submitted to his authority, opening up Scotland to later claims of sovereignty by English kings.A. A. M. Duncan, Scotland: The Making of the Kingdom, The Edinburgh History of Scotland, Volume 1 (Edinburgh: Mercat Press,1989), p. 120. When Malcolm died in 1093, his brother Domnall III (Donald III) succeeded him. However, William II of England backed M√°el Coluim's son by his first marriage, Donnchad, as a pretender to the throne and he seized power. His murder within a few months saw Domnall restored with one of M√°el Coluim sons by his second marriage, Edmund, as his heir. The two ruled Scotland until two of Edmund's younger brothers returned from exile in England, again with English military backing. Victorious, Edgar, the oldest of the three, became king in 1097.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 23‚Äì4. Shortly afterwards Edgar and the King of Norway, Magnus Bare Legs concluded a treaty recognising Norwegian authority over the Western Isles. In practice Norse control of the Isles was loose, with local chiefs enjoying a high degree of independence. He was succeeded by his brother Alexander, who reigned 1107‚Äì24.A. Forte, R. D. Oram and F. Pedersen, Viking Empires (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 238. Scoto-Norman kings: David I to Alexander III David I alongside his successor, Malcolm IV When Alexander died in 1124, the crown passed to Margaret's fourth son David I, who had spent most of his life as an English baron. His reign saw what has been characterised as a \\"Davidian Revolution\\", by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones, underpinning the development of later Medieval Scotland.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"David I of Scotland: The Balance of New and Old\\", in G. W. S. Barrow, ed., Scotland and Its Neighbours in the Middle Ages (London, 1992), pp. 9‚Äì11 pp. 9‚Äì11.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , p. 80. Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of feudal land tenure, which produced knight service, castles and an available body of heavily armed body of cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of justicar to oversee justice, and local offices of sheriffs to administer localities. He established the first royal burghs in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He continued a process begun by his mother and brothers, of helping to establish foundations that brought the reformed monasticism based on that at Cluny. He also played a part in the organisation of diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 29‚Äì37. These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I, with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities. The benefits of greater authority were reaped by William's son Alexander II and his son Alexander III, who pursued a policy of peace with England to expand their authority in the Highlands and Islands. By the reign of Alexander III, the Scots were in a position to annexe the remainder of the western seaboard, which they did following Haakon Haakonarson's ill-fated invasion and the stalemate of the Battle of Largs with the Treaty of Perth in 1266.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 153. =Late Middle Ages= Wars of Independence: Margaret to David II Robert I The death of King Alexander III in 1286, and then of his granddaughter and heir Margaret, Maid of Norway in 1290, left 14 rivals for succession. To prevent civil war the Scottish magnates asked Edward I of England to arbitrate, for which he extracted legal recognition that the realm of Scotland was held as a feudal dependency to the throne of England before choosing John Balliol, the man with the strongest claim, who became king in 1292.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 40. Robert Bruce, 5th Lord of Annandale, the next strongest claimant, accepted this outcome with reluctance. Over the next few years Edward I used the concessions he had gained to systematically undermine both the authority of King John and the independence of Scotland.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 42. In 1295 John, on the urgings of his chief councillors, entered into an alliance with France, known as the Auld Alliance.N. Macdougall, An Antidote to the English: the Auld Alliance, 1295‚Äì1560 (Tuckwell Press, 2001), p. 9. In 1296 Edward invaded Scotland, deposing King John. The following year William Wallace and Andrew de Moray raised forces to resist the occupation and under their joint leadership an English army was defeated at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. For a short time Wallace ruled Scotland in the name of John Balliol as guardian of the realm. Edward came north in person and defeated Wallace at the Battle of Falkirk.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , pp. 43‚Äì4. The English barons refuted the French-inspired papal claim to Scottish overlordship in the Barons' Letter, 1301, claiming it rather as long possessed by English kings. Wallace escaped but probably resigned as Guardian of Scotland. In 1305 he fell into the hands of the English, who executed him for treason despite the fact that he believed he owed no allegiance to England.A. Tuck, Crown and Nobility: England 1272‚Äì1461 (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2nd edn., 1999), , p. 31. Rivals John Comyn and Robert the Bruce, grandson of the claimant, were appointed as joint guardians in his place.David R. Ross, On the Trail of Robert the Bruce (Dundurn Press Ltd., 1999), , p. 21. On 10 February 1306, Bruce participated in the murder of Comyn, at Greyfriars Kirk in Dumfries.Hugh F. Kearney, The British Isles: a History of Four Nations (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2nd edn., 2006), , p. 116. Less than seven weeks later, on 25 March, Bruce was crowned as king. However, Edward's forces overran the country after defeating Bruce's small army at the Battle of Methven.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 216. Despite the excommunication of Bruce and his followers by Pope Clement V, his support slowly strengthened; and by 1314 with the help of leading nobles such as Sir James Douglas and Thomas Randolph only the castles at Bothwell and Stirling remained under English control.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 273. Edward I had died in 1307. His heir Edward II moved an army north to break the siege of Stirling Castle and reassert control. Robert defeated that army at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, securing de facto independence.M. Brown, Bannockburn: the Scottish War and the British Isles, 1307‚Äì1323 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2008), . In 1320 the Declaration of Arbroath, a remonstrance to the pope from the nobles of Scotland, helped convince Pope John XXII to overturn the earlier excommunication and nullify the various acts of submission by Scottish kings to English ones so that Scotland's sovereignty could be recognised by the major European dynasties. The declaration has also been seen as one of the most important documents in the development of a Scottish national identity.M. Brown, The Wars of Scotland, 1214‚Äì1371 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 217. In 1328, Edward III signed the Treaty of Northampton acknowledging Scottish independence under the rule of Robert the Bruce.M. H. Keen, England in the Later Middle Ages: a Political History (London: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2003), , pp. 86‚Äì8. However, four years after Robert's death in 1329, England once more invaded on the pretext of restoring Edward Balliol, son of John Balliol, to the Scottish throne, thus starting the Second War of Independence. Despite victories at Dupplin Moor and Halidon Hill, in the face of tough Scottish resistance led by Sir Andrew Murray, the son of Wallace's comrade in arms, successive attempts to secure Balliol on the throne failed. Edward III lost interest in the fate of his protege after the outbreak of the Hundred Years' War with France. In 1341 David II, King Robert's son and heir, was able to return from temporary exile in France. Balliol finally resigned his claim to the throne to Edward in 1356, before retiring to Yorkshire, where he died in 1364.P. Armstrong, Otterburn 1388: Bloody Border Conflict (London: Osprey Publishing, 2006), , p. 8. The Stewarts: Robert II to James IV James II (r. 1437‚Äì60), one of the most successful members of the Stewart dynasty before his accidental death at the siege of Roxburgh After David II's death, Robert II, the first of the Stewart kings, came to the throne in 1371. He was followed in 1390 by his ailing son John, who took the regnal name Robert III. During Robert III's reign (1390‚Äì1406), actual power rested largely in the hands of his brother, Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany.S. H. Rigby, A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley- Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 301‚Äì2. After the suspicious death (possibly on the orders of the Duke of Albany) of his elder son, David, Duke of Rothesay in 1402, Robert, fearful for the safety of his younger son, the future James I, sent him to France in 1406. However, the English captured him en route and he spent the next 18 years as a prisoner held for ransom. As a result, after the death of Robert III, regents ruled Scotland: first, the Duke of Albany; and later his son Murdoch.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 151‚Äì4. When Scotland finally paid the ransom in 1424, James, aged 32, returned with his English bride determined to assert this authority. Several members of the Albany family were executed, and he succeeded in centralising control in the hands of the crown, but at the cost of increasingly unpopularity and he was assassinated in 1437. His son James II when he came of age in 1449, continued his father's policy of weakening the great noble families, most notably taking on the powerful Black Douglas family that had come to prominence at the time of Robert I. His attempt to take Roxburgh from the English in 1460 succeeded, but at the cost of his life as he was killed by an exploding artillery piece.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 160‚Äì9. His young son came to the throne as James III, resulting in another minority, with Robert, Lord Boyd emerging as the most important figure. In 1468 James married Margaret of Denmark, receiving the Orkney and the Shetland Islands in payment of her dowry.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 5. In 1469 the King asserted his control, executing members of the Boyd family and his brothers, Alexander, Duke of Albany and John, Earl of Mar, resulting in Albany leading an English backed invasion and becoming effective ruler.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , pp. 171‚Äì2. The English retreated, having taken Berwick for the last time in 1482, and James was able to regain power. However, the King managed to alienate the barons, former supporters, his wife and his son James. He was defeated at the Battle of Sauchieburn and killed in 1488.C. J. Drees, The Late Medieval Age of Crisis and Renewal, 1300‚Äì1500 (London: Greenwood, 2001), , pp. 244‚Äì5. His successor James IV successfully ended the quasi-independent rule of the Lord of the Isles, bringing the Western Isles under effective Royal control for the first time. In 1503, he married Margaret Tudor, daughter of Henry VII of England, thus laying the foundation for the seventeenth century Union of the Crowns.Roger A. Mason, Scots and Britons: Scottish political thought and the union of 1603 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1994), , p. 162. However, in 1512 the Auld Alliance was renewed and under its terms, when the French were attacked by the English under Henry VIII the next year, James IV invaded England in support. The invasion was stopped decisively at the Battle of Flodden during which the King, many of his nobles, and a large number of ordinary troops were killed. Once again Scotland's government lay in the hands of regents in the name of the infant James V.G. Menzies The Scottish Nation (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2002), , p. 179. Government Coronation of Alexander III on Moot Hill, Scone, beside him are the Mormaers of Strathearn and Fife, while his genealogy is recited by a royal poet Kingship was the major form of political organisation in the Early Middle Ages, with competing minor kingdoms and fluid relationships of over and under kingdoms.B. Yorke, \\"Kings and kingship\\", in P. Stafford, ed., A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100 (Chichester: Wiley- Blackwell, 2009), , pp. 76‚Äì90. The primary function of these kings was as war leaders, but there were also ritual elements to kingship, evident in ceremonies of coronation.The unification of the Scots and Picts from the tenth century that produced the Kingdom of Alba, retained some of these ritual aspects in the coronation at Scone.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 45‚Äì7. While the Scottish monarchy remained a largely itinerant institution, Scone remained one of its most important locations,P. G. B. McNeill and Hector L. MacQueen, eds, Atlas of Scottish History to 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), pp. 159‚Äì63. with Royal castles at Stirling and Perth becoming significant in the later Middle Ages before Edinburgh developed as a capital in the second half of the fifteenth century.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 14‚Äì15. The Scottish crown grew in prestige throughout the era and adopted the conventional offices of Western European courtsN. H. Reid, \\"Crown and Community under Robert I\\", in G. W. S. Barrow, A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 221. and later elements of their ritual and grandeur. In the early period the kings of the Scots depended on the great lords of the mormaers (later earls) and To√≠sechs (later thanes), but from the reign of David I sheriffdoms were introduced, which allowed more direct control and gradually limited the power of the major lordships.P. G. B. McNeill and Hector L. MacQueen, eds, Atlas of Scottish History to 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), pp. 191‚Äì4. While knowledge of early systems of law is limited, justice can be seen as developing from the twelfth century onwards with local sheriff, burgh, manorial and ecclesiastical courts and offices of the justicar to oversee administration.K. Reid and R. Zimmerman, A History of Private Law in Scotland: I. Introduction and Property (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), , pp. 24‚Äì82. The Scots common law began to develop in this periodD. H. S. Sellar, \\"Gaelic Laws and Institutions\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (New York, 2001), pp. 381‚Äì82. and there were attempts to systematise and codify the law and the beginnings of an educated professional body of lawyers.K. Reid and R. Zimmerman, A History of Private Law in Scotland: I. Introduction and Property (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), , p. 66. In the Late Middle Ages major institutions of government, including the privy council and parliament developed. The council emerged as a full-time body in the fifteenth century, increasingly dominated by laymen and critical to the administration of justice. Parliament also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the era it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 21‚Äì3. Warfare The Battle of Otterburn (1388) in a miniature from Jean Froissart, Chroniques In the Early Middle Ages, war on land was characterised by the use of small war-bands of household troops often engaging in raids and low level warfare.L. Alcock, Kings and Warriors, Craftsmen and Priests in Northern Britain AD 550‚Äì850 (Edinburgh: Society of Antiquaries of Scotland), , pp. 248‚Äì9. The arrival of the Vikings brought a new scale of naval warfare, with rapid movement based around the Viking longship. The birlinn, which developed from the longship, became a major factor in warfare in the Highlands and Islands.N. A. M. Rodger, The Safeguard of the Sea: A Naval History of Britain. Volume One 660‚Äì1649 (London: Harper, 1997) pp. 13‚Äì14. By the High Middle Ages, the kings of Scotland could command forces of tens of thousands of men for short periods as part of the \\"common army\\", mainly of poorly armoured spear and bowmen.K. J. Stringer, The Reign of Stephen: Kingship, Warfare, and Government in Twelfth-Century England (Psychology Press, 1993), , pp. 30‚Äì1. After the introduction of feudalism to Scotland, these forces were augmented by small numbers of mounted and heavily armoured knights. Feudalism also introduced castles into the country, originally simple wooden motte-and-bailey constructions, but these were replaced in the thirteenth century with more formidable stone \\"enceinte\\" castles, with high encircling walls.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 21. In the thirteenth century the threat of Scandinavian naval power subsided and the kings of Scotland were able to use naval forces to help subdue the Highlands and Islands. Scottish field armies rarely managed to stand up to the usually larger and more professional armies produced by England, but they were used to good effect by Robert I at Bannockburn in 1314 to secure Scottish independence.D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 108. He also made use of naval power to support his forces and began to develop a royal Scottish naval force.J. Grant, \\"The Old Scots Navy from 1689 to 1710\\", Publications of the Navy Records Society, 44 (London: Navy Records Society, 1913-4), pp. i‚Äìxii. Under the Stewart kings these forces were further augmented by specialist troops, particularly men-at-arms and archers, hired by bonds of manrent, similar to English indentures of the same period.M. Brown, The Wars of Scotland, 1214‚Äì1371 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 58. New \\"livery and maintenance\\" castles were built to house these troops and castles began to be adapted to accommodate gunpowder weapons.T. W. West, Discovering Scottish Architecture (Botley: Osprey, 1985), , p. 27. The Stewarts also adopted major innovations in continental warfare, such as longer pikes J. Cooper, Scottish Renaissance Armies 1513‚Äì1550 (Botley: Osprey, 2008), , p. 23. and the extensive use of artillery,D. H. Caldwell, \\"The Scots and guns\\", in A. King and M. A.

However, in the early fifteenth century one of the best armed and largest Scottish armies ever assembled still met with defeat at the hands of an English army at the Battle of Flodden in 1513, which saw the destruction of a large number of ordinary troops, a large section of the nobility and the king, James IV. Religion St Margaret of Scotland, credited with the reform of Scottish monasticism, from a later genealogy Christianity was probably introduced to what is now lowland Scotland from Roman soldiers stationed in the north of the province of Britannia.B. Cunliffe, The Ancient Celts (Oxford, 1997), , p. 184. It is presumed to have survived among the Brythonic enclaves in the south of modern Scotland, but retreated as the pagan Anglo-Saxons advanced.O. Davies, Celtic Spirituality (Paulist Press, 1999), , p. 21. Scotland was largely converted by Irish-Scots missions associated with figures such as St Columba from the fifth to the seventh centuries. These missions tended to found monastic institutions and collegiate churches that served large areas.O. Clancy, \\"The Scottish provenance of the 'Nennian' recension of Historia Brittonum and the Lebor Bretnach \\" in: S. Taylor (ed.), Picts, Kings, Saints and Chronicles: A Festschrift for Marjorie O. Anderson (Dublin: Four Courts, 2000), pp. 95‚Äì6 and A. P. Smyth, Warlords and Holy Men: Scotland AD 80‚Äì1000 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 82‚Äì3. Partly as a result of these factors, some scholars have identified a distinctive form of Celtic Christianity, in which abbots were more significant than bishops, attitudes to clerical celibacy were more relaxed and there was some significant differences in practice with Roman Christianity, particularly the form of tonsure and the method of calculating Easter, although most of these issues had been resolved by the mid-seventh century.C. Evans, \\"The Celtic Church in Anglo-Saxon times\\", in J. D. Woods, D. A. E. Pelteret, The Anglo-Saxons, synthesis and achievement (Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1985), , pp. 77‚Äì89.C. Corning, The Celtic and Roman Traditions: Conflict and Consensus in the Early Medieval Church (Macmillan, 2006), . After the reconversion of Scandinavian Scotland from the tenth century, Christianity under papal authority was the dominant religion of the kingdom.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 67‚Äì8. In the Norman period the Scottish church underwent a series of reforms and transformations. With royal and lay patronage, a clearer parochial structure based around local churches was developed.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 109‚Äì117. Large numbers of new foundations, which followed continental forms of reformed monasticism, began to predominate and the Scottish church established its independence from England, developed a clearer diocesan structure, becoming a \\"special daughter of the see of Rome\\", but lacking leadership in the form of archbishops.P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 26‚Äì9. In the Late Middle Ages the problems of schism in the Catholic Church allowed the Scottish Crown to gain greater influence over senior appointments and two archbishoprics had been established by the end of the fifteenth century.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 76‚Äì87. While some historians have discerned a decline of monasticism in the Late Middle Ages, the mendicant orders of friars grew, particularly in the expanding burghs, to meet the spiritual needs of the population. New saints and cults of devotion also proliferated. Despite problems over the number and quality of clergy after the Black Death in the fourteenth century, and some evidence of heresy in this period, the church in Scotland remained relatively stable before the Reformation in the sixteenth century. Geography The development of the border with England Modern Scotland is half the size England and Wales in area, but with its many inlets, islands and inland lochs, it has roughly the same amount of coastline at 4,000 miles. Only a fifth of Scotland is less than 60 metres above sea level. Its east Atlantic position means that it has very heavy rainfall: today about 700 cm per year in the east and over 1,000 cm in the west. This encouraged the spread of blanket peat bog, the acidity of which, combined with high level of wind and salt spray, made most of the islands treeless. The existence of hills, mountains, quicksands and marshes made internal communication and conquest extremely difficult and may have contributed to the fragmented nature of political power.C. Harvie, Scotland: a Short History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2002), , pp. 10‚Äì11. The defining factor in the geography of Scotland is the distinction between the Highlands and Islands in the north and west and the Lowlands in the south and east. The highlands are further divided into the Northwest Highlands and the Grampian Mountains by the fault line of the Great Glen. The lowlands are divided into the fertile belt of the Central Lowlands and the higher terrain of the Southern Uplands, which included the Cheviot hills, over which the border with England came to run by the end of the period.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 2. Some of these were further divided by mountains, major rivers and marshes.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 9‚Äì20. The Central Lowland belt averages about 50 miles in widthWorld and Its Peoples (London: Marshall Cavendish), , p. 13. and, because it contains most of the good quality agricultural land and has easier communications, could support most of the urbanisation and elements of conventional Medieval government. However, the Southern Uplands, and particularly the Highlands were economically less productive and much more difficult to govern. This provided Scotland with a form of protection, as minor English incursions had to cross the difficult southern uplandsA. G. Ogilvie, Great Britain: Essays in Regional Geography (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1952), p. 421. and the two major attempts at conquest by the English, under Edward I and then Edward III, were unable to penetrate the highlands, from which area potential resistance could reconquer the Lowlands.R. R. Sellmen, Medieval English Warfare (London: Taylor & Francis, 1964), p. 29. However, it also made those areas problematic to govern for Scottish kings and much of the political history of the era after the wars of independence circulated around attempts to resolve problems of entrenched localism in these regions.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 39‚Äì40. Until the thirteenth century the borders with England were very fluid, with Northumbria being annexed to Scotland by David I, but lost under his grandson and successor Malcolm IV in 1157.R. R. Davies, The First English Empire: Power and Identities in the British Isles, 1093‚Äì1343 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000), , p. 64. By the late thirteenth century when the Treaty of York (1237) and Treaty of Perth (1266) had fixed the boundaries with the Kingdom of the Scots with England and Norway respectively, its borders were close to the modern boundaries.W. P. L. Thomson, The New History of Orkney (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2008), , p. 204. The Isle of Man fell under English control in the fourteenth century, despite several attempts to restore Scottish authority.A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, eds, Uniting the Kingdom?: the Making of British History (London: Routledge, 1995), , p. 101. The English were able to annexe a large slice of the Lowlands under Edward III, but these losses were gradually regained, particularly while England was preoccupied with the Wars of the Roses (1455‚Äì85).P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 21. The dowry of the Orkney and Shetland Islands in 1468 was the last great land acquisition for the kingdom. However, in 1482 Berwick, a border fortress and the largest port in Medieval Scotland, fell to the English once again, for what was to be the final change of hands. Economy and society =Economy= A silver penny of David I, the first silver coinage to bear a Scottish king's head Having between a fifth or sixth ( 15-20 % ) of the arable or good pastoral land and roughly the same amount of coastline as England and Wales, marginal pastoral agriculture and fishing were two of the most important aspects of the Medieval Scottish economy.E. Gemmill and N. J. Mayhew, Changing Values in Medieval Scotland: a Study of Prices, Money, and Weights and Measures (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , pp. 8‚Äì10. With poor communications, in the Early Middle Ages most settlements needed to achieve a degree of self- sufficiency in agriculture.A. Woolf, From Pictland to Alba: 789 ‚Äì 1070 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , pp. 17‚Äì20. Most farms were based around a family unit and used an infield and outfield system.H. P. R. Finberg, The Formation of England 550‚Äì1042 (London: Paladin, 1974), , p. 204. Arable farming grew in the High Middle AgesG. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 12. and agriculture entered a period of relative boom between the thirteenth century and late fifteenth century.S. H. Rigby, ed., A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 111‚Äì6. Unlike England, Scotland had no towns dating from Roman occupation. From the twelfth century there are records of burghs, chartered towns, which became major centres of crafts and trade.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 98. and there is evidence of 55 burghs by 1296.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 122‚Äì3. There are also Scottish coins, although English coinage probably remained more significant in trade and until the end of the period barter was probably the most common form of exchange.A. MacQuarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , pp. 136‚Äì40.K. J. Stringer, \\"The Emergence of a Nation-State, 1100‚Äì1300\\", in J. Wormald, ed., Scotland: A History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005), , pp. 38‚Äì76. Nevertheless, craft and industry remained relatively undeveloped before the end of the Middle AgesJ. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 41‚Äì55. and, although there were extensive trading networks based in Scotland, while the Scots exported largely raw materials, they imported increasing quantities of luxury goods, resulting in a bullion shortage and perhaps helping to create a financial crisis in the fifteenth century. =Demography= There are almost no written sources from which to re-construct the demography of early Medieval Scotland. Estimates have been made of a population of 10,000 inhabitants in D√°l Riata and 80‚Äì100,000 for Pictland.L. R. Laing, The Archaeology of Celtic Britain and Ireland, c. AD 400‚Äì1200 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2006), , pp. 21‚Äì2. It is likely that the 5th and 6th centuries saw higher mortality rates due to the appearance of bubonic plague, which may have reduced net population.P. Fouracre and R. McKitterick, eds, The New Cambridge Medieval History: c. 500-c. 700 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2005), , p. 234. The examination of burial sites for this period like that at Hallowhill, St Andrews indicate a life expectancy of only 26‚Äì29 years. The known conditions have been taken to suggest it was a high fertility, high mortality society, similar to many developing countries in the modern world, with a relatively young demographic profile, and perhaps early childbearing, and large numbers of children for women. This would have meant that there were a relatively small proportion of available workers to the number of mouths to feed. This have made it difficult to produce a surplus that would allow demographic growth and more complex societies to develop. From the formation of the Kingdom of Alba in the tenth century, to before the Black Death reached the country in 1349, estimates based on the amount of farmable land, suggest that population may have grown from half a million to a million.R. E. Tyson, \\"Population Patterns\\", in M. Lynch, ed., The Oxford Companion to Scottish History (New York, 2001), pp. 487‚Äì8. Although there is no reliable documentation on the impact of the plague, there are many anecdotal references to abandoned land in the following decades. If the pattern followed that in England, then the population may have fallen to as low as half a million by the end of the fifteenth century.S. H. Rigby, ed., A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (Oxford: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , pp. 109‚Äì11. Compared with the situation after the redistribution of population in the later clearances and the industrial revolution, these numbers would have been relatively evenly spread over the kingdom, with roughly half living north of the Tay.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , p. 61. Perhaps ten per cent of the population lived in one of many burghs that grew up in the later Medieval period, mainly in the east and south. It has been suggested that they would have had a mean population of about 2,000, but many would be much smaller than 1,000 and the largest, Edinburgh, probably had a population of over 10,000 by the end of the era. =Social structure= Map showing Highland clans and Lowland surnames The organisation of society is obscure in the early part of the period, for which there are few documentary sources.D. E. Thornton, \\"Communities and kinship\\", in P. Stafford, ed., A Companion to the Early Middle Ages: Britain and Ireland, c.500-c.1100 (Chichester: Wiley- Blackwell, 2009), , pp. 98. Kinship probably provided the primary unit of organisation and society was divided between a small aristocracy, whose rationale was based around warfare,C. Haigh, The Cambridge Historical Encyclopedia of Great Britain and Ireland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1990), , pp. 82‚Äì4. a wider group of freemen, who had the right to bear arms and were represented in law codes,J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2006), , p. 369. above a relatively large body of slaves, who may have lived beside and become clients of their owners. By the thirteenth century there are sources that allow greater stratification in society to be seen, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably a large group of serfs, particularly in central Scotland.A. Grant, \\"Thanes and Thanages, from the eleventh to the fourteenth centuries\\" in A. Grant and K. Stringer, eds., Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community, Essays Presented to G. W. S. Barrow (Edinburgh University Press: Edinburgh, 1993), , p. 42. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread.A. Grant, \\"Scotland in the Central Middle Ages\\", in A. MacKay and D. Ditchburn (eds), Atlas of Medieval Europe (Routledge: London, 1997), , p. 97. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen with more modest landholdings.G. W. S. Barrow, \\"Scotland, Wales and Ireland in the twelfth century\\", in D. E. Luscombe and J. Riley-Smith, eds, The New Cambridge Medieval History, Volume IV. 1024-c. 1198, part 2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), , p. 586. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era.G. W. S. Barrow, Robert Bruce (Berkeley CA.: University of California Press, 1965), p. 7. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks.D. E. R. Wyatt, \\"The provincial council of the Scottish church\\", in A. Grant and K. J. Stringer, Medieval Scotland: Crown, Lordship and Community (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , p. 152. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth centuryJ. Goodacre, State and Society in Early Modern Scotland (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999), , pp. 57‚Äì60. and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, there was a lack of major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 48‚Äì9. Culture =Language and culture= thumbuprightleftAn interpretation of the linguistic divide c. 1400, based on place-name evidence. Modern linguists divide Celtic languages into two major groups, the P-Celtic, from which the Brythonic languages: Welsh, Breton, Cornish and Cumbric derive, and the Q-Celtic, from which come the Goidelic languages: Irish, Manx and Gaelic. The Pictish language remains enigmatic, since the Picts had no written script of their own and all that survives are place names and some isolated inscriptions in Irish ogham script. Most modern linguists accept that, although the nature and unity of Pictish language is unclear, it belonged to the former group.R. Mitchison, A History of Scotland (London: Routledge, 3rd edn., 2002), , p. 4. Historical sources, as well as place name evidence, indicate the ways in which the Pictish language in the north and Cumbric languages in the south were overlaid and replaced by Gaelic, Old English and later Norse in this period.W. O. Frazer and A. Tyrrell, Social Identity in Early Medieval Britain (London: Continuum, 2000), , p. 238. By the High Middle Ages the majority of people within Scotland spoke the Gaelic language, then simply called Scottish, or in Latin, lingua Scotica.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , p. 14. The Kingdom of Alba was overwhelmingly an oral society dominated by Gaelic culture. Our fuller sources for Ireland of the same period suggest that there would have been filidh, who acted as poets, musicians and historians, often attached to the court of a lord or king, and passed on their knowledge and culture in Gaelic to the next generation.R. A. Houston, Scottish Literacy and the Scottish Identity: Illiteracy and Society in Scotland and Northern England, 1600‚Äì1800 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), , p. 76. In the Northern Isles the Norse language brought by Scandinavian occupiers and settlers evolved into the local Norn, which lingered until the end of the eighteenth centuryG. Lamb, \\"The Orkney Tongue\\" in D. Omand, ed., The Orkney Book (Edinburgh: Birlinn, 2003), p. 250. and Norse may also have survived as a spoken language until the sixteenth century in the Outer Hebrides.A. Jennings and A. Kruse, \\"One Coast-Three Peoples: Names and Ethnicity in the Scottish West during the Early Viking period\\", in A. Woolf, ed., Scandinavian Scotland ‚Äì Twenty Years After (St Andrews: St Andrews University Press, 2007), , p. 97. French, Flemish and particularly English became the main language of Scottish burghs, most of which were located in the south and east, an area to which Anglian settlers had already brought a form of Old English. In the later part of the twelfth century, the writer Adam of Dryburgh described lowland Lothian as \\"the Land of the English in the Kingdom of the Scots\\".K. J. Stringer, \\"Reform Monasticism and Celtic Scotland\\", in E. J. Cowan and R. A. McDonald, eds, Alba: Celtic Scotland in the Middle Ages (East Lothian: Tuckwell Press, 2000), , p. 133. At least from the accession of David I, Gaelic ceased to be the main language of the royal court and was probably replaced by French, as evidenced by reports from contemporary chronicles, literature and translations of administrative documents into the French language. After this \\"de- gallicisation\\" of the Scottish court, a less highly regarded order of bards took over the functions of the filidh and they would continue to act in a similar role in the Highlands and Islands into the eighteenth century. They often trained in bardic schools, of which a few, like the one run by the MacMhuirich dynasty, who were bards to the Lord of the Isles,K. M. Brown, Noble Society in Scotland: Wealth, Family and Culture from the Reformation to the Revolutions (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2004), , p. 220. existed in Scotland and a larger number in Ireland, until they were suppressed from the seventeenth century. Members of bardic schools were trained in the complex rules and forms of Gaelic poetry. Much of their work was never written down and what survives was only recorded from the sixteenth century.R. Crawford, Scotland's Books: A History of Scottish Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009), . In the late Middle Ages, Middle Scots, often simply called English, became the dominant language of the country. It was derived largely from Old English, with the addition of elements from Gaelic and French. Although resembling the language spoken in northern England, it became a distinct dialect from the late fourteenth century onwards.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 60‚Äì7. It began to be adopted by the ruling elite as they gradually abandoned French. By the fifteenth century it was the language of government, with acts of parliament, council records and treasurer's accounts almost all using it from the reign of James I onwards. As a result, Gaelic, once dominant north of the Tay, began a steady decline. Lowland writers began to treat Gaelic as a second class, rustic and even amusing language, helping to frame attitudes towards the highlands and to create a cultural gulf with the lowlands. =Education= Tower of St Salvator's College, St Andrews, one of the three universities founded in the fifteenth century The establishment of Christianity brought Latin to Scotland as a scholarly and written language. Monasteries served as major repositories of knowledge and education, often running schools and providing a small educated elite, who were essential to create and read documents in a largely illiterate society.A. Macquarrie, Medieval Scotland: Kinship and Nation (Thrupp: Sutton, 2004), , p. 128. In the High Middle Ages new sources of education arose, with song and grammar schools. These were usually attached to cathedrals or a collegiate church and were most common in the developing burghs. By the end of the Middle Ages grammar schools could be found in all the main burghs and some small towns. Early examples including the High School of Glasgow in 1124 and the High School of Dundee in 1239. There were also petty schools, more common in rural areas and providing an elementary education.M. Lynch, Scotland: A New History (Random House, 2011), , pp. 104‚Äì7. Some monasteries, like the Cistercian abbey at Kinloss, opened their doors to a wider range of students. The number and size of these schools seems to have expanded rapidly from the 1380s. They were almost exclusively aimed at boys, but by the end of the fifteenth century, Edinburgh also had schools for girls, sometimes described as \\"sewing schools\\", and probably taught by lay women or nuns. There was also the development of private tuition in the families of lords and wealthy burghers. The growing emphasis on education cumulated with the passing of the Education Act 1496, which decreed that all sons of barons and freeholders of substance should attend grammar schools to learn \\"perfyct Latyne\\". All this resulted in an increase in literacy, but which was largely concentrated among a male and wealthy elite,P. J. Bawcutt and J. H. Williams, A Companion to Medieval Scottish Poetry (Woodbridge: Brewer, 2006), , pp. 29‚Äì30. with perhaps 60 per cent of the nobility being literate by the end of the period.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 68‚Äì72. Until the fifteenth century, those who wished to attend university had to travel to England or the continent, and just over a 1,000 have been identified as doing so between the twelfth century and 1410. Among these the most important intellectual figure was John Duns Scotus, who studied at Oxford, Cambridge and Paris and probably died at Cologne in 1308, becoming a major influence on late Medieval religious thought.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 119. After the outbreak of the Wars of Independence, with occasional exceptions under safe conduct, English universities were closed to Scots and continental universities became more significant.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 124‚Äì5. Some Scottish scholars became teachers in continental universities. At Paris this included John De Rate and Walter Wardlaw in the 1340s and 1350s, William de Tredbrum in the 1380s and Laurence de Lindores in the early 1500s. This situation was transformed by the founding of the University of St Andrews in 1413, the University of Glasgow in 1450 and the University of Aberdeen in 1495. Initially these institutions were designed for the training of clerics, but they would increasingly be used by laymen who would begin to challenge the clerical monopoly of administrative post in the government and law. Those wanting to study for second degrees still needed to go elsewhere and Scottish scholars continued to visit the continent and English universities reopened to Scots in the late fifteenth century. The continued movement to other universities produced a school of Scottish nominalists at Paris in the early sixteenth century, of which John Mair was probably the most important figure. He had probably studied at a Scottish grammar school, then Cambridge, before moving to Paris, where he matriculated in 1493. By 1497 the humanist and historian Hector Boece, born in Dundee and who had studied at Paris, returned to become the first principal at the new university of Aberdeen. These international contacts helped integrate Scotland into a wider European scholarly world and would be one of the most important ways in which the new ideas of humanism were brought into Scottish intellectual life. =Literature= A page from the Book of Aneirin shows the first part of the text from the Y Gododdin, c. sixth century Much of the earliest Welsh literature was actually composed in or near the country now called Scotland, in the Brythonic speech, from which Welsh would be derived, include The Gododdin and the Battle of Gwen Ystrad.R. T. Lambdin and L. C. Lambdin, Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature (London: Greenwood, 2000), , p. 508. There are also religious works in Gaelic including the Elegy for St Columba by Dallan Forgaill, c. 597 and \\"In Praise of St Columba\\" by Beccan mac Luigdech of Rum, c. 677.J. T. Koch, Celtic Culture: a Historical Encyclopedia (ABC- CLIO, 2006), , p. 999. In Latin they include a \\"Prayer for Protection\\" (attributed to St Mugint), c. mid-sixth century and Altus Prosator (\\"The High Creator\\", attributed to St Columba), c. 597.I. Brown, T. Owen Clancy, M. Pittock, S. Manning, eds, The Edinburgh History of Scottish Literature: From Columba to the Union, until 1707 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2007), , p. 94. In Old English there is The Dream of the Rood, from which lines are found on the Ruthwell Cross, making it the only surviving fragment of Northumbrian Old English from early Medieval Scotland.E. M. Treharne, Old and Middle English c.890-c.1400: an Anthology (Wiley-Blackwell, 2004), , p. 108. Before the reign of David I, the Scots possessed a flourishing literary elite that produced texts in both Gaelic and Latin, a tradition that survived in the Highlands into the thirteenth century.D. Broun, \\"Gaelic Literacy in Eastern Scotland between 1124 and 1249\\" in H. Pryce ed., Literacy in Medieval Celtic Societies (Cambridge, 1998), , pp. 183‚Äì201. It is possible that more Middle Irish literature was written in Medieval Scotland than is often thought, but has not survived because the Gaelic literary establishment of eastern Scotland died out before the fourteenth century.T. O. Clancy, \\"Scotland, the 'Nennian' recension of the Historia Brittonum, and the Lebor Bretnach\\", in S. Taylor, ed., Kings, Clerics and Chronicles in Scotland, 500‚Äì1297 (Dublin/Portland, 2000), , pp. 87‚Äì107. In the thirteenth century, French flourished as a literary language, and produced the Roman de Fergus, the earliest piece of non-Celtic vernacular literature to survive from Scotland.M. Fry, Edinburgh (London: Pan Macmillan, 2011), . The first surviving major text in Early Scots literature is John Barbour's Brus (1375), composed under the patronage of Robert II and telling the story in epic poetry of Robert I's actions before the English invasion till the end of the war of independence.A. A. M. Duncan, ed., The Brus (Canongate, 1997), , p. 3. Much Middle Scots literature was produced by makars, poets with links to the royal court, which included James I (who wrote The Kingis Quair). Many of the makars had a university education and so were also connected with the Kirk. However, Dunbar's Lament for the Makaris (c.1505) provides evidence of a wider tradition of secular writing outside of Court and Kirk, now largely lost.A. Grant, Independence and Nationhood, Scotland 1306‚Äì1469 (Baltimore: Edward Arnold, 1984), pp. 102‚Äì3. Before the advent of printing in Scotland, writers such as Robert Henryson, William Dunbar, Walter Kennedy and Gavin Douglas have been seen as leading a golden age in Scottish poetry. In the late fifteenth century, Scots prose also began to develop as a genre. Although there are earlier fragments of original Scots prose, such as the Auchinleck Chronicle,Thomas Thomson, ed., Auchinleck Chronicle (Edinburgh, 1819). the first complete surviving work includes John Ireland's The Meroure of Wyssdome (1490).J.

There were also prose translations of French books of chivalry that survive from the 1450s, including The Book of the Law of Armys and the Order of Knychthode and the treatise Secreta Secetorum, an Arabic work believed to be Aristotle's advice to Alexander the Great. The landmark work in the reign of James IV was Gavin Douglas's version of Virgil's Aeneid, the Eneados, which was the first complete translation of a major classical text in an Anglian language, finished in 1513, but overshadowed by the disaster at Flodden. =Art= The Trinity Altarpiece, attributed to Flemish artist Hugo van der Goes for the Trinity College Kirk in Edinburgh, Scotland, in the late fifteenth century In the early middles ages, there were distinct material cultures evident in the different linguistic groups, federations and kingdoms within what is now Scotland. Pictish art can be seen in the extensive survival of carved stones, particularly in the north and east of the country, which hold a variety of recurring images and patterns, as at Dunrobin (Sutherland) and Aberlemno stones (Angus).J. Graham-Campbell and C. E. Batey, Vikings in Scotland: an Archaeological Survey (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1998), , pp. 7‚Äì8. It can also be seen in elaborate metal work that largely survives in buried hordes like the St Ninian's Isle Treasure.L. R. Laing, Later Celtic Art in Britain and Ireland (London: Osprey Publishing, 1987), , p. 37. Irish-Scots art from the Kingdom of D√°l Riata is much more difficult to identify, but may include items like the Hunterston brooch, which with other items like the Monymusk Reliquary, suggest that D√°l Riata was one of the places, as a crossroads between cultures, where the Insular style developed.A. Lane, \\"Citadel of the first Scots\\", British Archaeology, 62, December 2001. Retrieved 2 December 2010. Insular art is the name given to the common style that developed in Britain and Ireland after the conversion of the Picts and the cultural assimilation of Pictish culture into that of the Scots and Angles,H. Honour and J. Fleming, A World History of Art (London: Macmillan), , pp. 244‚Äì7. and which became highly influential in continental Europe, contributing to the development of Romanesque and Gothic styles.G. Henderson, Early Medieval Art (London: Penguin, 1972), pp. 63‚Äì71. It can be seen in elaborate jewellery, often making extensive use of semi- precious stones,S.

T. Koch, Celtic Culture: A Historical Encyclopedia, Volumes 1‚Äì5 (ABC-CLIO, 2006), , pp. 915‚Äì19. and particularly in the highly decorated illustrated manuscripts such as the Book of Kells, which may have been begun, or wholly created on Iona. The finest era of the style was brought to an end by the disruption to monastic centres and aristocratic life of the Viking raids in the late eighth century.C. R. Dodwell, The Pictorial Arts of the West, 800‚Äì1200 (Yale UP, 1993), , pp. 85 and 90. Scotland adopted the Romanesque in the late twelfth century, retaining and reviving elements of its style after the Gothic had become dominant elsewhere from the thirteenth century.T. M. Devine and J. Wormald, The Oxford Handbook of Modern Scottish History (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), , p. 190. Much of the best Scottish artwork of the High and Late Middle Ages was either religious in nature or realised in metal and woodwork, and has not survived the impact of time and of the Reformation. However, examples of sculpture are extant as part of church architecture, including evidence of elaborate church interiors like the sacrament houses at Deskford and KinkellI. D. Whyte and K. A. Whyte, The Changing Scottish Landscape, 1500‚Äì1800 (London: Taylor & Francis, 1991), , p. 117. and the carvings of the seven deadly sins at Rosslyn Chapel.S. H. Rigby, A Companion to Britain in the Later Middle Ages (London: Wiley-Blackwell, 2003), , p. 532. From the thirteenth century, there are relatively large numbers of monumental effigies like the elaborate Douglas tombs in the town of Douglas.K. Stevenson, Chivalry and Knighthood in Scotland, 1424‚Äì1513 (Boydell Press, 2006), , pp. 125‚Äì8. Native craftsmanship can be seen in items like the Bute mazer and the Savernake Horn, and more widely in the large number of high quality seals that survive from the mid thirteenth century onwards.B. Webster, Medieval Scotland: the Making of an Identity (St. Martin's Press, 1997), , pp. 127‚Äì9. Visual illustration can be seen in the illumination of charters,R. Brydall, Art in Scotland: its Origins and Progress (Edinburgh and London: Blackwood, 1889), p. 17. and occasional survivals like the fifteenth century Doom painting at Guthrie.M. R. Apted and W. R. Robinson, \\"Late fifteenth century church painting from Guthrie and Foulis Easter\\", Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland, vol. 95 (1964), pp. 262‚Äì79. Surviving copies of individual portraits are relatively crude, but more impressive are the works or artists commissioned from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, including Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh and the Hours of James IV of Scotland.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 57‚Äì9. =Architecture= Linlithgow Palace, the first building to bear that title in Scotland, extensively rebuilt along Renaissance principles from the fifteenth century Medieval vernacular architecture utilised local building materials, including cruck constructed houses, turf walls and clay, with a heavy reliance on stone.R. W. Brunskill, Houses and Cottages of Britain (New Haven, CT: Yale University Press, 2nd edn., 2000), , pp. 235‚Äì40. As burghs developed there were more sophisticated houses for the nobles, burgesses and other inhabitants. By the end of the period some were stone built with slate roofs or tiles.J. Hunter, Last of the Free: A History of the Highlands and Islands of Scotland (London: Random House, 2011), . Medieval parish church architecture was typically simpler than in England, with many churches remaining simple oblongs, without transepts and aisles, and often without towers. From the eleventh century there were influences from English and continental European designs and grander ecclesiastical buildings were built in the Romanesque style, as can be seen at Dunfermline Abbey and Elgin Cathedral,I. Maxwell, A History of Scotland's Masonry Construction in P. Wilson, ed., Building with Scottish Stone (Edinburgh: Arcamedia, 2005), , pp. 22‚Äì3. and later the Gothic style as at Glasgow Cathedral and in the rebuilding of Melrose Abbey. From the early fifteenth century the introduction of Renaissance styles included the selective return of Romanesque forms, as in the nave of Dunkeld Cathedral and in the chapel of Bishop Elphinstone's Kings College, Aberdeen (1500‚Äì09).M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , pp. 3‚Äì4. Many of the motte and bailey castles introduced into Scotland with feudalism in the twelfth century and the castles \\"enceinte\\", with a high embattled curtain wall that replaced those still in occupation, were slighted during the Wars of Independence. In the late Middle Ages new castles were built, some on a grander scale as \\"livery and maintenance\\" castles, to house retained troops. Gunpowder weaponry fundamentally altered the nature of castle architecture, with existing castles being adapted to allow the use of gunpowder weapons by the incorporation of \\"keyhole\\" gun ports, platforms to mount guns and walls being adapted to resist bombardment. Ravenscraig, Kirkcaldy, begun about 1460, is probably the first castle in the British Isles to be built as an artillery fort, incorporating \\"D-shape\\" bastions that would better resist cannon fire and on which artillery could be mounted. The largest number of late medieval fortifications in Scotland built by nobles were of the tower house design.G. Stell, \\"War-damaged Castles: the evidence from Medieval Scotland,\\" in Chateau Gaillard: Actes du colloque international de Graz (Autriche) (Caen, France: Publications du CRAHM, 2000), , p. 278.S. Reid, Castles and Tower Houses of the Scottish Clans, 1450‚Äì1650 (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , p. 12. primarily aimed to provide protection against smaller raiding parties, rather than a major siege.S. Reid, Castles and Tower Houses of the Scottish Clans, 1450‚Äì1650 (Botley: Osprey, 2006), , pp. 12 and 46. Extensive building and rebuilding of royal palaces in the Renaissance style probably began under James III and accelerated under James IV. Linlithgow was first constructed under James I, under the direction of master of work John de Waltoun and was referred to as a palace, apparently the first use of this term in the country, from 1429. This was extended under James III and began to correspond to a fashionable quadrangular, corner-towered Italian signorial palace, combining classical symmetry with neo-chivalric imagery.M. Glendinning, R. MacInnes and A. MacKechnie, A History of Scottish Architecture: From the Renaissance to the Present Day (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1996), , p. 9. =Music= The Chapel Royal, Stirling Castle, a major focus for liturgical music In the late twelfth century, Giraldus Cambrensis noted that \\"in the opinion of many, Scotland not only equals its teacher, Ireland, but indeed greatly outdoes it and excels her in musical skill\\". He identified the Scots as using the cithara, tympanum and chorus, although what exactly these instruments were is unclear.A. Budgey, \\"Commeationis et affinitatis: Medieval musical relations between Scotland and Ireland\\", in R. A. McDonald, History, Literature, and Music in Scotland, 700‚Äì1560 (University of Toronto Press, 2002), , p. 208. Bards probably accompanied their poetry on the harp, and can also be seen in records of the Scottish courts throughout the Medieval period.W. McLeod, Divided Gaels: Gaelic Cultural Identities in Scotland and Ireland, C.1200-c.1650 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2004), , p. 102. Scottish church music from the thirteenth century was increasingly influenced by continental developments, with figures like the musical theorist Simon Tailler studying in Paris, before returned to Scotland where he introduced several reforms of church music.K. Elliott and F. Rimmer, A History of Scottish Music (London: British Broadcasting Corporation, 1973), , pp. 8‚Äì12. Scottish collections of music like the thirteenth century 'Wolfenb√ºttel 677', which is associated with St Andrews, contain mostly French compositions, but with some distinctive local styles. The captivity of James I in England from 1406 to 1423, where he earned a reputation as a poet and composer, may have led him to take English and continental styles and musicians back to the Scottish court on his release. In the late fifteenth century a series of Scottish musicians trained in the Netherlands before returning home, including John Broune, Thomas Inglis and John Fety, the last of whom became master of the song school in Aberdeen and then Edinburgh, introducing the new five-fingered organ playing technique.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 58 and 118. In 1501 James IV refounded the Chapel Royal within Stirling Castle, with a new and enlarged choir and it became the focus of Scottish liturgical music. Burgundian and English influences were probably reinforced when Henry VII's daughter Margaret Tudor married James IV in 1503.M. Gosman, A. A. MacDonald, A. J. Vanderjagt and A. Vanderjagt, Princes and Princely Culture, 1450‚Äì1650 (Brill, 2003), , p. 163. National identity The Royal Standard of Scotland, first adopted by king William I (1143‚Äì1214) In the High Middle Ages the word \\"Scot\\" was only used by Scots to describe themselves to foreigners, amongst whom it was the most common word. They called themselves Albanach or simply Gaidel. Both \\"Scot\\" and Gaidel were ethnic terms that connected them to the majority of the inhabitants of Ireland. At the beginning of the thirteenth century, the author of De Situ Albanie noted that: \\"The name Arregathel [Argyll] means margin of the Scots or Irish, because all Scots and Irish are generally called 'Gattheli'.\\"A. O. Anderson, Early Sources of Scottish History: AD 500‚Äì1286, 2 vols (Edinburgh, 1922). vol. i, p. cxviii. Scotland came to possess a unity which transcended Gaelic, French and Germanic ethnic differences and by the end of the period, the Latin, French and English word \\"Scot\\" could be used for any subject of the Scottish king. Scotland's multilingual Scoto-Norman monarchs and mixed Gaelic and Scoto-Norman aristocracy all became part of the \\"Community of the Realm\\", in which ethnic differences were less divisive than in Ireland and Wales.G. W. S. Barrow, Kingship and Unity: Scotland 1000‚Äì1306 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1989), , pp. 122‚Äì43. This identity was defined in opposition to English attempts to annexe the country and as a result of social and cultural changes. The resulting antipathy towards England dominated Scottish foreign policy well into the fifteenth century, making it extremely difficult for Scottish kings like James III and James IV to pursue policies of peace towards their southern neighbour.A. D. M. Barrell, Medieval Scotland (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000), , p. 134. In particular the Declaration of Arbroath asserted the ancient distinctiveness of Scotland in the face of English aggression, arguing that it was the role of the king to defend the independence of the community of Scotland. This document has been seen as the first \\"nationalist theory of sovereignty\\".C. Kidd, Subverting Scotland's Past: Scottish Whig Historians and the Creation of an Anglo-British Identity 1689‚Äì1830 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2003), , pp. 17‚Äì18. Cross of St. Andrew, adopted as a national symbol in this period The adoption of Middle Scots by the aristocracy has been seen as building a shared sense of national solidarity and culture between rulers and ruled, although the fact that north of the Tay Gaelic still dominated may have helped widen the cultural divide between highlands and lowlands. The national literature of Scotland created in the late medieval period employed legend and history in the service of the crown and nationalism, helping to foster a sense of national identity, at least within its elite audience. The epic poetic history of the Brus and Wallace helped outline a narrative of united struggle against the English enemy. Arthurian literature differed from conventional versions of the legend by treating Arthur as a villain and Mordred, the son of the king of the Picts, as a hero.J. Wormald, Court, Kirk, and Community: Scotland, 1470‚Äì1625 (Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1991), , pp. 66‚Äì7. The origin myth of the Scots, systematised by John of Fordun (c. 1320-c. 1384), traced their beginnings from the Greek prince Gathelus and his Egyptian wife Scota, allowing them to argue superiority over the English, who claimed their descent from the Trojans, who had been defeated by the Greeks. The image of St. Andrew, martyred while bound to an X-shaped cross, first appeared in the Scotland during the reign of William I and was again depicted on seals used during the late thirteenth century; including on one particular example used by the Guardians of Scotland, dated 1286.\\"Feature: Saint Andrew seals Scotland's independence\\" , The National Archives of Scotland, 28 November 2007, retrieved 12 September 2009. Use of a simplified symbol associated with Saint Andrew, the saltire, has its origins in the late fourteenth century; the Parliament of Scotland decreed in 1385 that Scottish soldiers should wear a white Saint Andrew's Cross on their person, both in front and behind, for the purpose of identification. Use of a blue background for the Saint Andrew's Cross is said to date from at least the fifteenth century.G. Bartram, www.flaginstitute.org British Flags & Emblems (Edinburgh: Tuckwell Press, 2004), , p. 10. The earliest reference to the Saint Andrew's Cross as a flag is to be found in the Vienna Book of Hours, circa 1503.G.

Biography Born in Antwerp to an Eastern Swedish father and Flemish mother, Eriksson became a Nazi at an early age and joined the Hitler Youth before the end of the Second World War. A staunch anti- communist, he went in 1950 to fight in the Korean War. In 1968 he opened a cafe, 'Den Odal', in Antwerp which became a leading centre for neo-Nazis after the War. He took command of the Vlaamse Militanten Orde (VMO) in 1971 after it had been disbanded by founder Bob Maes and turned it towards a more extreme right path.Cas Mudde, The Ideology of the Extreme Right, Manchester University Press, 2000, p. 84 After the VMO was outlawed in 1984 he became associated with the Vlaams Blok, as well as the Odal Group, which presented itself as the successor to the VMO. As VMO leader Eriksson had been brought to trial in 1981 on charges of leading a private army but, although initially found guilty, he was acquitted by the Antwerp court of appeal in June 1982.Paul Wilkinson, The New Fascists, Pan Books, 1983, pp. 148-149 The VMO itself continued in defiance of the ban although Eriksson's leadership came to an end in 1985 when Jan Eggermont took over.Alex Peter Schmid, A.

Eriksson had been at the heart of the formation of the Vlaams Blok, setting up a series of talks in 1978 between right wing leaders that ultimately led to the formation of the party. He also went on to be associated with the Wehrwolf-Verbond, an anti-Semitic group based in Antwerp, and addressed their rally in 1996. He died in Westdorpe, Netherlands from lung disease, aged 73.

The River Farset (An Fhearsaid or Abhainn na Feirste in Irish) is a river in Belfast, Northern Ireland, which gave the city its name. It is a late tributary of the River Lagan. Course The Farset rises above Ballysillan on Squire's Hill, flowed past the medieval parish church at Shankill, through Millfield and under High Street, giving that street a curving appearance, entering the Lagan to the east of the Albert Clock and High Street. It is on the County Antrim side of the Lagan and its entry to the Lagan is close to its outflow into Belfast Lough. The Farset is now contained within a tunnel under Belfast's High Street; a tunnel supposedly big enough to take a bus. Course of the Farset river. History Belfast was founded at a sandy ford across the Farset, and this is the origin of the city's name - B√©al Feirste, the Mouth of the Farset. Farset itself comes from an Irish word meaning sandbar. Among the early references to the ford is of a battle between Ulidians and Picts in 667 and a Papal Taxation Roll of 1306 refers to 'the chapel of the Ford'. The banks of the Farset became the first quaysides of the developing merchant city and the river flowed beside docks on High Street in the 19th century. In the late 18th century it was one of many Belfast rivers which provided the power for early industrialisation by powering factories and supplying water for bleach greens. In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries, the river was sometimes known as Belfast River, the River of Belfast, the Town River, or the High Street River.George Benn, A History of the Town of Belfast (1877), pp. 470, 527 and 548.

The Buffyverse is expanded through other additional materials such as comics, novels, pilots, promos and video games which do not necessarily take place in exactly the same fictional continuity as the Buffy episodes and Angel episodes. Star Trek, Star Wars, Stargate and other prolific sci-fi and fantasy franchises have similarly gathered complex fictional continuities through hundreds of stories told in different formats.See Star Trek canon, Star Wars canon. These canons have been more clearly defined than the Buffyverse canon. Definition Using the religious analogy of a canon of scripture (see Biblical canon), things that are not canon are considered \\"apocryphal.\\" When a body of work is not specifically accepted or rejected by an authority, \\"canon\\" can be a fluid term that is interpreted differently by different people. This is the case with \\"Buffyverse canon\\", which has yet to be publicly defined by an authority to the satisfaction and consensus of all observers (see: links to canon debates). The creator of the Buffyverse, Joss Whedon, has implied that additional materials he was not heavily involved in creating were separate from canon.Faraci, Devin, Exclusive Interview: Joss Whedon, CHUD.com (September 22, 2005) When asked in an interview about canon, Whedon stated: Canon listing This is an overview of what has been dubbed official Buffyverse canon by the series creator Joss Whedon: *All 144 episodes of Buffy the Vampire Slayer *All 110 episodes of Angel *The 1999 comic series The Origin *The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight comic series and related one-shots *The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine and Angel and Faith comic series, as well as spin-offs (Spike: A Dark Place and Willow: Wonderland) *The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten and Angel and Faith Volume 2 comic series *The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven and Angel comic series and Giles spin-off *The Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Twelve comic series *The Angel: After the Fall comic series (#1‚Äì17) *The Spike: After the Fall comic series *The Spike comic series *The Fray comic series *The Tales of the Slayers one-shot *The Tales of the Vampires comic series Comics and novels Outside of the TV series, the Buffyverse has been expanded and elaborated on by various authors and artists in the so-called \\"Buffyverse Expanded Universe\\". The Buffyverse novels and Buffyverse comics are licensed by 20th Century Fox, but are generally considered 'less real' within the Buffyverse (apocryphal).Naso, Markisan, Jeff Mariotte: Cursed , Silver Bullet Comic Books (2005) Despite this, they have been licensed as official Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel merchandise. Furthermore, many authors have said that Whedon or his office have had to approve their overall outline for their novel or comic if not the final product. This was to prevent the stories venturing too far from the original intentions of Buffy/Angel stories (see below). These works are commonly considered non-canon. Jeff Mariotte, author of Buffyverse novels and comics has said: =Works by Buffyverse writers and cast= Joss Whedon Work created with Joss Whedon's involvement has been described as canon by commentators,Allie, Scott \\"An Interview with Scott Allie \\". Stakesandsalvation.com (May 16, 2007) and by Whedon himself. For example, he announced in 2005: In a separate interview, Whedon spoke of the planning process for the series: Whedon has also written the comic mini-series Long Night's Journey, as well as short stories for Tales of the Slayers and Tales of the Vampires. Fray is an eight-part comic series written by Whedon, about a Vampire Slayer of the future named Melaka Fray. In the Buffyverse, a powerful scythe used by Buffy is found in centuries to come by Melaka Fray. In 2001, whilst Whedon was still producing Buffy, he spoke about his concern of implications of information established by Fray (and Buffy comics generally) affecting the canon Buffyverse: However, the Buffy series finale did not match continuity set by Fray. In Fray no mention is made of the Slayer's essence being split amongst multiple women.Whedon, Joss, \\"Chosen\\", Buffy TV episode (2003) When asked about the apparent contradictions between Buffy and Fray, Whedon responded: In an interview with TV Guide, Whedon revealed that he considered TV tie-in comics to be \\"ancillary\\" unless written by the script- writers: Mutant Enemy Several of the comics have been written by the scriptwriters of Mutant Enemy Productions. Doug Petrie wrote comics Ring of Fire, Double Cross, and Bad Dog. Jane Espenson has written comics (Haunted, Jonathan, and Reunion), as well as two Tales of the Slayer prose shorts (\\"Again, Sunnydale\\" and \\"Two Teenage Girls at the Mall\\"). Rebecca Rand Kirshner also wrote a prose short story for Tales of the Slayer, \\"The War Between the States\\". Buffyverse cast Two actors have co-authored comics with Christopher Golden. James Marsters, who portrayed Spike, co- authored \\"Paint the Town Red\\", whilst Amber Benson co-authored Willow & Tara. Benson also wrote the comic short story \\"The Innocent\\". =Works by other authors= All other Buffyverse comics and novels were written by authors that were not involved with any level of production of the television series Buffy the Vampire Slayer or Angel. The creators of these works are generally free to tell their own stories set in the Buffyverse, and may or may not keep to established continuity. Similarly, writers for the TV series were under no obligation to use continuity which has been established by the Expanded Universe, and sometimes contradicted it. Continuity problems Usually the authors and editors of these licensed materials try not to contradict information that has been established by canon. However, many of the materials do directly contradict it. Jeff Mariotte has said: For example, according to Monster Island, Spike and Gunn meet in the Hyperion Hotel in Angel Season 3;Golden, Christopher & Sniegoski, Thomas E., Monster Island, Pocket Books, (March 2003) however, the canonical Angel TV series later established that Spike and Gunn meet in the Wolfram and Hart L.A. offices in Angel Season 5.Whedon, Joss, \\"Conviction\\" Angel TV series (2003). Some of the licensed materials successfully avoid contradicting any information given in episodes. For example, How I Survived My Summer Vacation features short stories that take place after Buffy Season 1 but before Season 2. Joss Whedon's involvement A number of comments by Buffyverse writers have indicated that although they know they are not writing Buffyverse canon, overviews for their stories may still have been checked over by Whedon. Referring to Whedon, Christopher Golden said: In a separate interview, Golden said: Similarly, Peter David was asked about his comic, Spike: Old Times, and said: Jeff Mariotte has revealed more detail of the approval process: Mariotte implies that little input is given, only acceptance or rejection of general ideas: When asked how much attention he pays to licensed works, Whedon said: Elsewhere, Whedon has pointed out that he has never entirely read a single Buffy novel, and has little time to devote to such material. He therefore knows little of the final product, or of their quality control. Sanction by Joss Whedon In one instance, Whedon has endorsed a comic neither written nor supervised by him, The Origin by Christopher Golden and Dan Brereton, as canonical. An adaptation of the 1992 Buffy film which was reworked to fit the television series' continuity, Whedon said this of the comic: Brian Lynch, writer of Spike: Asylum and Spike: Shadow Puppets, had no involvement in the production of the Buffy or Angel television series, but was charged by Joss Whedon with producing the canonical comic series Angel: After The Fall. Betta George, a character created by Lynch, has since been brought into the official canon. Angel: After the Fall also makes explicit reference to Spike: Asylum within its pages. When After the Fall became an ongoing series penned by various writers, the canonicity of later stories became somewhat nebulous without the explicit say-so of those involved or Whedon himself. Other Buffy productions Excluding the Buffy and Angel television episodes, novels, and comics, there have been a variety of other official productions in the Buffy franchise. They are largely regarded as apocryphal, and some are contradicted by other canonical works. =Buffy the Vampire Slayer (1992 film)= Buffy the Vampire Slayer, the 1992 comedy film starring Kristy Swanson as Buffy, was written by Joss Whedon and directed by Fran Rubel Kuzui. In 2001, Whedon described his experience watching the film: The film contradicts continuity established by the Buffy television series; for example, the nature of vampires differs in significant ways: in the film, vampires do not have \\"vamp\\" faces whilst feeding, and can fly. They also do not turn into dust when killed. As noted above, the canonicity of this film is superseded by The Origin. =Television pilots= Whedon wrote and partly funded a 25-minute unaired Buffy pilotTopping, Keith \\"Slayer\\". Virgin Publishing, (December 1, 2004), p7 to help sell the series concept, but he was not happy with the final product (he has been quoted in an interview about the pilot, \\"It sucks on ass\\"Ken, P., \\"An Interview with Joss Whedon \\", filmforce.ign.com, page 10 (June 23, 2003).). The story is nearly identical to the plot of the first Buffy episode, \\"Welcome to the Hellmouth\\", which supersedes it in canon; there are minor canonical changes, including the recasting of some roles and slight personality changes for some characters. The unaired Angel pitch tape was produced prior to that series. It features Angel speaking toward the camera (possibly breaking the Fourth wall) and narrating action seen in clips. =Video games= The Buffy the Vampire Slayer video games do not contradict continuity established by the series. Furthermore, many of the actors from the shows have provided their voices for the games. Joss Whedon was involved in Chaos Bleeds, and appears in the game's special features. =Undeveloped productions= Mutant Enemy Productions have at various times gone into the early stages of development with potential Buffyverse spinoffs that were ultimately unproduced. Faith the Vampire Slayer, Ripper, Slayer School, and the Spike movie would have taken place within the same fictional continuity. Buffy the Animated Series might have followed a slightly alternative continuity since promotional artwork has shown that the Sunnydale High library would have looked dramatically different from in the Buffy episodes. The David Fury-written script \\"Corrupt\\" establishes an alternative continuity after the premiere Angel episode, \\"City of\\". Events that take place in the story are instead superseded by the continuity of the second Angel episode, \\"Lonely Hearts\\", the episode which was written to replace \\"Corrupt\\".

Negahban was born Ahvaz, Iran. After graduating from Firouz Bahram High School, In 1949 he finished his BA in archaeology at the University of Tehran and in 1954 he received his MA in archaeology from the University of Chicago, after completing his thesis under Donald McCown. He was appointed Associate Professor in the Department of Archaeology, University of Tehran, in 1955, and was made a full Professor in 1962. He served as Chairman of the Department from 1967 to 1978, and as Dean of the Faculty of Letters and Humanities from 1975 to 1979. He was Technical Director of the Iranian Archaeological Service from 1960 to 1965, and served as Technical Advisor of the Iranian Ministry of Culture from 1965 to 1979. He served as a Visiting Curator at the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania from 1980 until 2000. He was chief scientist in many excavations on Iranian ancient sites including Marlik, near Rudbar, Haft Tepe, near Susa and Ahvaz, where he founded a museum to showcase artifacts from the site, and on the plane of Hamadan Province, where a training center for students was established. Among the critical contributions of Prof. Negahban to Iranian archaeology were his reforms to the curriculum of the Department of Archaeology at the University of Tehran, and the founding of the Institute of Archaeology. While he introduced and encouraged a more scientific approach to the field from the time he was appointed to the Department of Archaeology in 1956, starting in 1967, when he became Chairman of the Department, he reworked the curriculum around a significant component of fieldwork, mandatory for all students starting in 1970-1971. To facilitate this he established a base-camp of the Department's field school on the Qazvin Plain at the site of a restored Safavid caravanserai, and secured a long-term permit to conduct field work from the Archaeological Service of Iran. Having introduced a significant practical component to the Department, he introduced a Master's program, including further fieldwork at the Haft Tepe excavation in Khuzestan Province during the winter seasons. The Institute for Archeology, which he founded in 1959 and where he served as Director until 1979, played a critical role in these improvements by providing instructors and students with office space, and laboratory and library facilities to analyse the results of fieldwork and publish articles. He built on these successes by securing scholarships for the pursuit of PhDs by students abroad. He was also a good friend of British archaeologist Sir Max Mallowan, former widower of Agatha Christie.

It is located on the Edinburgh-Bathgate Line 15¬Ω miles (25 km) west of Edinburgh and situated in the Carmondean area of Livingston. The other railway station in the town is on the Shotts Line.  History  Livingston North station opened on 24 March 1986, concurrent with the re-introduction of passenger services under British Rail on the Edinburgh to Bathgate Line. This station is situated a quarter of a mile east of the original Livingston station. As the line between Cawburn Junction and Bathgate had been singled, the stations at Livingston North and Uphall only required to have single platforms. The platform at Livingston North was built on the solum of the former Up (towards Edinburgh) line due to the station site being in a cutting and the need to provide ramped access (via a 'switchback' path) to it in addition to stepped access. When the station was built, the area immediately south of the line was undeveloped, this being the main reason that the platform was constructed on the north (up) side of the line. Following route modernisation, re-establishment of double track, new platform for westbound trains and electrification, there are fairly large parking areas to the north and south of the station. As the station has been constructed without a footbridge, access between platforms and parking areas is by way of lengthy disabled ramps and a road bridge. From opening in March 1986 until December 2010, train services were operated by diesel multiple units, initially Class 101s. From 1987, services were formed of units but by 2008, and/or Class 170s were used. From December 2010, following electrification, services have been formed of Class 334 electric multiple units.  Airdrie - Bathgate Link  With the commencement of work for the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link, much excavation was needed around Livingston North station to provide the new platform and to avoid complete closure of the existing platform, which would have been unavoidable had the original railway boundary been observed. The new, second platform came into use on 20 October 2008, when for the first time in over half a century, passenger traffic served the area on a double track railway. Works continue to complete the transformation of the station. Electrification followed in October 2010 in conjunction with the re-opening of the through route to Drumgelloch and Airdrie. Rail services between Edinburgh and Livingston North were suspended in December 2010 due to cold weather. MSP Angela Constance said \\"The situation of train services in and around Livingston is desperate. The worst example is that no trains have left Livingston North station in the past 10 days\\". Stewart Stevenson replied blaming frozen points: \\"A particular issue in the rail network is heating the points at the junction where the line to Bathgate and Livingston North leaves the main line from Edinburgh to Glasgow via Falkirk.\\"  Services  = 2007/08 = Monday to Saturday daytimes there was a half-hourly service eastbound to continuing to and westbound to Bathgate. Evenings and Sundays there is an hourly service in each direction. =From December 2008= Monday to Saturday daytimes there was a half-hourly service eastbound to Edinburgh Waverley and westbound to 1986 Bathgate station. Evenings and Sundays there is an hourly service in each direction. =October to December 2010= Monday to Saturday daytimes there was a half-hourly service eastbound to Edinburgh Waverley and westbound to the 2010 station. Evenings and Sundays there is an hourly service in each direction. =Winter 2010/11 (From 12 December 2010)= During the week there is an eastbound service of four trains per hour to Edinburgh, with three per hour to Bathgate and one per hour to Helensburgh Central as a result of delays with commissioning of the Class 380 trains, insufficient Class 334 trains for the full service have been available for introduction of intended timetable from 12 December 2010. When sufficient trains are available, the westbound services will consist of two trains per hour to Helensburgh Central and two trains per hour to Milngavie. = 2016 = There are four departure each hour in each direction (off peak Mon-Sat) in the May 2016 timetable, with two per hour in the evening and on Sundays. Westbound trains run to Queen St L.L via Bathgate & Airdrie and then onward to either Helensburgh Central or Milngavie (daytimes only), though some late night trains terminate short at Airdrie or Bathgate.

He is a Professor Emeritus of Economics at University College London (UCL) and a Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Bristol.http://www.bristol.ac.uk/economics/staff/binmore.html He is one of the founders of the modern economic theory of bargaining (along with Nash and Rubinstein), and has made important contributions to the foundations of game theory, experimental economics, and evolutionary game theory, as well as to analytical philosophy. Binmore took up economics after a career in mathematics, during which he held the Chair of Mathematics at the London School of Economics. Since his switch to economics he has been at the forefront of developments in game theory. His other research interests include political and moral philosophy, decision theory, and statistics. He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and 14 books. Education He studied mathematics at Imperial College London where he was awarded 1st class honours BSc with Governor's Prize, and subsequently PhD (in mathematical analysis). Research Binmore's major research contributions are to the theory of bargaining and its testing in the laboratory. He is a pioneer of experimental economics. He began his experimental work in the 1980s when most economists thought that game theory would not work in the laboratory. Binmore and his collaborators established that game theory can often predict the behaviour of experienced players very well in laboratory settings, even in the case of human bargaining behaviour, a particularly challenging case for game theory. This has brought him into conflict with some proponents of behavioural economics who emphasise the importance of other-regarding or social preferences, and argue that their findings threaten traditional game theory. Binmore's work in political and moral philosophy began in the 1980s when he first applied bargaining theory to John Rawls' original position. His search for the philosophical foundations of the original position took him first to Kant's works, and then to Hume. Hume inspired Binmore to contribute to a naturalistic science of morals that seeks foundations for Rawlsian ideas about fairness norms in biological and social evolution. The result was his two- volume Game Theory and the Social Contract, an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for a genuine science of morals using the theory of games. In Game Theory and the Social Contract Binmore proposes a naturalistic reinterpretation of John Rawls' original position that reconciles his egalitarian theory of justice with John Harsanyi's utilitarian theory. His recent Natural Justice provides a nontechnical synthesis of this work. Affiliations In 1995 Binmore became one of the founding directors of the Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution (ELSE), an interdisciplinary research centre involving economists, psychologists, anthropologists and mathematicians based at University College London. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, ELSE pursues fundamental research on evolutionary and learning approaches to games and society, and it applies its theoretical findings to practical problems in government and business. While the Director of ELSE, Binmore became widely known as the ‚Äòpoker-playing economic theorist‚Äô who netted the British government ¬£22 billion when he led the team that designed the third generation (3G) telecommunications auction in 2000. He went on to design and implement 3G spectrum auctions in Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Israel and Hong Kong. Binmore is Emeritus Professor of Economics at University College London, Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the University of Bristol and Visiting Professor in the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the London School of Economics. He has held corresponding positions at the London School of Economics, Caltech, the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Michigan. He is a Fellow of the Econometric Society and the British Academy. He was appointed a CBE in the New Year's Honours List 2001 for contributions to game theory and for his role in designing the UK's 3G telecommunications auctions. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2002. In 2007 he was appointed an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the University of Bristol and an Honorary Fellow of the Centre for Philosophy at the London School of Economics.

In addition, 16 master's-level dual degree programs blend public affairs study with specialized professions or area studies and are structured so that students can earn the Master of Public Affairs degree and a second degree in less time than it would take to earn them separately.\\" Program offerings include a traditional Master of Public Affairs program, a mid-career master's program, seventeen master's-level programs leading to dual degrees including: Advertising; Asian Studies; Business Administration; Communication Studies; Energy and Earth Resources; Engineering; Information Studies; Journalism; Latin American Studies; Law; Middle Eastern Studies; Public Health; Radio, Television, Film; Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies; Social Work; and Women's and Gender Studies. The school also offers a Ph.D. in public policy. Master's students have the option to specialize in one of seven areas: international affairs; natural resources and the environment; nonprofit and philanthropic studies; public leadership and management; social and economic policy; technology, innovation, and information policy; or urban and state affairs. As of 2011-2012, the LBJ School has graduated 3,508 master's degree students since its first inaugural class of 1972, as well as 56 Ph.D. students from 1992 to August 2013. In 2008, the LBJ School also introduced a Master of Global Policy Studies that offers a multidisciplinary approach to the complex economic, political, technological, and social issues of the 21st century. Program offerings include specializations in the areas of security, law and diplomacy; international trade and finance; development; global governance and international law; energy, environment, and technology; regional international policy, and customized specializations. Program offerings include ten dual degree programs with the following programs: Asian Studies; Business; Energy and Earth Resources; Information Studies; Journalism; Latin American Studies; Law; Middle Eastern Studies; Public Health; and Russian, East European, and Eurasian Studies. The school also offers a Portfolio Program in Arts and Cultural Management and Entrepreneurship and a Portfolio Program in Nonprofit Studies. The school also sponsors a variety of non-degree programs for public affairs professionals. In 2013, the LBJ School launched a new Executive Master in Public Leadership for mid-career professionals. The first of its kind in Texas. Mission The school's goals are stated as to: Prepare students and professionals, from a variety of backgrounds, for leadership positions in public service by providing educational opportunities grounded in theory, ethics, analytical skills, and practice; Produce interdisciplinary research to advance our understanding of complex problems facing society and to seek creative solutions for addressing them; Promote effective public policy and management practice by maintaining a presence in scholarly and policy communities and in the popular media; and Foster civic engagement by providing a forum for reasoned discussion and debate on issues of public concern.  Centers  The LBJ School of Public Affairs also features five research centers. Many of the School's centers also sponsor a range of other activities, including conferences, workshops, and publications. = Center for Politics and Governance = The Center for Politics and Governance is dedicated to producing leaders and ideas to improve the political process and governance through innovative teaching, research and programming combining academics and the real world. = Ray Marshall Center for the Study of Human Resources = The Ray Marshall Center is a university-based research center. The Center's activities and services include: Program evaluation, including process and implementation, impact and benefit/cost analysis; Survey research;Labor market analysis; Program design and development; Training and technical assistance. = Center for Health and Social Policy (CHASP) = CHASP studies how health and social policy can be improved and designs and conducts research in policymaking and health, economic and social program outcomes. = RGK Center for Philanthropy and Community Service = The Center's research addresses pressing issues in philanthropy, nonprofit management, social entrepreneurship, and global civil society. The Center trains students through a university-wide graduate program in nonprofit studies. = The Robert S.

Static torque is relatively easy to measure. Dynamic torque, on the other hand, is not easy to measure, since it generally requires transfer of some effect (electric, hydraulic or magnetic) from the shaft being measured to a static system. One way to achieve this is to condition the shaft or a member attached to the shaft with a series of permanent magnetic domains. The magnetic characteristics of these domains will vary according to the applied torque, and thus can be measured using non-contact sensors. Such magnetoelastic torque sensors are generally used for in-vehicle applications on racecars, automobiles, aircraft, and hovercraft. Commonly, torque sensors or torque transducers use strain gauges applied to a rotating shaft or axle. With this method, a means to power the strain gauge bridge is necessary, as well as a means to receive the signal from the rotating shaft. This can be accomplished using slip rings, wireless telemetry, or rotary transformers. Newer types of torque transducers add conditioning electronics and an A/D converter to the rotating shaft. Stator electronics then read the digital signals and convert those signals to a high-level analog output signal, such as +/-10VDC. A more recent development is the use of SAW devices attached to the shaft and remotely interrogated. The strain on these tiny devices as the shaft flexes can be read remotely and output without the need for attached electronics on the shaft. The probable first use in volume will be in the automotive field as, of May 2009, Schott announced it has a SAW sensor package viable for in vehicle uses. Another way to measure torque is by way of twist angle measurement or phase shift measurement, whereby the angle of twist resulting from applied torque is measured by using two angular position sensors and measuring the phase angle between them. This technique is used in the Allison T56 turboprop engine. Finally, (as described within the abstract for US Patent 5257535), if the mechanical system involves a right angle gearbox, then the axial reaction force experienced by the inputting shaft/pinion can be related to the torque experienced by the output shaft(s). The axial input stress must first be calibrated against the output torque. The input stress can be easily measured via strain gauge measurement of the input pinion bearing housing. The output torque is easily measured using a static torque meter.

Gensler, The A to Z of Logic (2010) p. 74. Rowman & Littlefield, It is defined as a deductive argument that is invalid. The argument itself could have true premises, but still have a false conclusion. Thus, a formal fallacy is a fallacy where deduction goes wrong, and is no longer a logical process. This may not affect the truth of the conclusion, since validity and truth are separate in formal logic. While a logical argument is a non sequitur if, and only if, it is invalid, the term \\"non sequitur\\" typically refers to those types of invalid arguments which do not constitute formal fallacies covered by particular terms (e.g. affirming the consequent). In other words, in practice, \\"non sequitur\\" refers to an unnamed formal fallacy. A special case is a mathematical fallacy, an intentionally invalid mathematical proof, often with the error subtle and somehow concealed. Mathematical fallacies are typically crafted and exhibited for educational purposes, usually taking the form of spurious proofs of obvious contradictions. A formal fallacy is contrasted with an informal fallacy, which may have a valid logical form and yet be unsound because one or more premises are false.  Taxonomy  The standard Aristotelian logical fallacies are: * Fallacy of four terms (Quaternio terminorum); * Fallacy of the undistributed middle; * Fallacy of illicit process of the major or the minor term; * Affirmative conclusion from a negative premise. Other logical fallacies include: * The self-reliant fallacy In philosophy, the term logical fallacy properly refers to a formal fallacy‚Äîa flaw in the structure of a deductive argument, which renders the argument invalid. It is often used more generally in informal discourse to mean an argument that is problematic for any reason, and encompasses informal fallacies as well as formal fallacies‚Äîvalid but unsound claims or poor non- deductive argumentation. The presence of a formal fallacy in a deductive argument does not imply anything about the argument's premises or its conclusion (see fallacy fallacy). Both may actually be true, or even more probable as a result of the argument (e.g. appeal to authority), but the deductive argument is still invalid because the conclusion does not follow from the premises in the manner described. By extension, an argument can contain a formal fallacy even if the argument is not a deductive one; for instance an inductive argument that incorrectly applies principles of probability or causality can be said to commit a formal fallacy. =Affirming the consequent= Any argument that takes the following form is a non sequitur #If A is true, then B is true. #B is true. #Therefore, A is true. Even if the premise and conclusion are all true, the conclusion is not a necessary consequence of the premise. This sort of non sequitur is also called affirming the consequent. An example of affirming the consequent would be: #If Jackson is a human (A), then Jackson is a mammal. (B) #Jackson is a mammal. (B) #Therefore, Jackson is a human. (A) While the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise: # Humans are mammals. # Jackson is a mammal. # Therefore, Jackson is a human. The truth of the conclusion is independent of the truth of its premise ‚Äì it is a 'non sequitur', since Jackson might be a mammal without being human. He might be an elephant. Affirming the consequent is essentially the same as the fallacy of the undistributed middle, but using propositions rather than set membership. =Denying the antecedent= Another common non sequitur is this: #If A is true, then B is true. #A is false. #Therefore, B is false. While B can indeed be false, this cannot be linked to the premise since the statement is a non sequitur. This is called denying the antecedent. An example of denying the antecedent would be: #If I am Japanese, then I am Asian. #I am not Japanese. #Therefore, I am not Asian. While the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the statement's declarant could be another ethnicity of Asia, e.g. Chinese, in which case the premise would be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true. =Affirming a disjunct= Affirming a disjunct is a fallacy when in the following form: #A is true or B is true. #B is true. #Therefore, A is not true.* The conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both true. This fallacy stems from the stated definition of or in propositional logic to be inclusive. An example of affirming a disjunct would be: #I am at home or I am in the city. #I am at home. #Therefore, I am not in the city. While the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the declarant of the statement very well could be in both the city and their home, in which case the premises would be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true. *Note that this is only a logical fallacy when the word \\"or\\" is in its inclusive form. If the two possibilities in question are mutually exclusive, this is not a logical fallacy. For example, #I am either at home or I am in the city. #I am at home. #Therefore, I am not in the city. =Denying a conjunct= Denying a conjunct is a fallacy when in the following form: #It is not the case that both A is true and B is true. #B is not true. #Therefore, A is true. The conclusion does not follow from the premise as it could be the case that A and B are both false. An example of denying a conjunct would be: #I cannot be both at home and in the city. #I am not at home. #Therefore, I am in the city. While the conclusion may be true, it does not follow from the premise. For all the reader knows, the declarant of the statement very well could neither be at home nor in the city, in which case the premise would be true but the conclusion false. This argument is still a fallacy even if the conclusion is true. =Fallacy of the undistributed middle= The fallacy of the undistributed middle is a fallacy that is committed when the middle term in a categorical syllogism is not distributed. It is a syllogistic fallacy. More specifically it is also a form of non sequitur. The fallacy of the undistributed middle takes the following form: #All Zs are Bs. #Y is a B. #Therefore, Y is a Z. It may or may not be the case that \\"all Zs are Bs\\", but in either case it is irrelevant to the conclusion. What is relevant to the conclusion is whether it is true that \\"all Bs are Zs,\\" which is ignored in the argument. An example can be given as follows, where B=mammals, Y=Mary and Z=humans: #All humans are mammals. #Mary is a mammal. #Therefore, Mary is a human. Note that if the terms (Z and B) were swapped around in the first co-premise then it would no longer be a fallacy and would be correct. In contrast to informal fallacy Formal logic is not used to determine whether or not an argument is true. Formal arguments can either be valid or invalid. A valid argument may also be sound or unsound: * A valid argument has a correct formal structure. A valid argument is one where if the premises are true, the conclusion must be true. * A sound argument is a formally correct argument that also contains true premises. Ideally, the best kind of formal argument is a sound, valid argument. Formal fallacies do not take into account the soundness of an argument, but rather its validity. Premises in formal logic are commonly represented by letters (most commonly p and q). A fallacy occurs when the structure of the argument is incorrect, despite the truth of the premises. As modus ponens, the following argument contains no formal fallacies: # If P then Q # P # Therefore Q A logical fallacy associated with this format of argument is referred to as affirming the consequent, which would look like this: # If P then Q # Q # Therefore P This is a fallacy because it does not take into account other possibilities. To illustrate this more clearly, substitute the letters with premises: # If it rains, the street will be wet. # The street is wet. # Therefore, it rained. Although it is possible that this conclusion is true, it does not necessarily mean it must be true. The street could be wet for a variety of other reasons that this argument does not take into account. If we look at the valid form of the argument, we can see that the conclusion must be true: # If it rains, the street will be wet. # It rained. # Therefore, the street is wet. This argument is valid and, if it did rain, it would also be sound. If statements 1 and 2 are true, it absolutely follows that statement 3 is true. However, it may still be the case that statement 1 or 2 is not true. For example: # If Albert Einstein makes a statement about science, it is correct. # Albert Einstein states that all quantum mechanics is deterministic. # Therefore, it's true that quantum mechanics is deterministic. In this case, statement 1 is false. The particular informal fallacy being committed in this assertion is argument from authority. By contrast, an argument with a formal fallacy could still contain all true premises: #If an animal is a dog, then it has four legs. # My cat has four legs. # Therefore, my cat is a dog. Although 1 and 2 are true statements, 3 does not follow because the argument commits the formal fallacy of affirming the consequent. An argument could contain both an informal fallacy and a formal fallacy yet lead to a conclusion that happens to be true, for example, again affirming the consequent, now also from an untrue premise: # If a scientist makes a statement about science, it is correct. # It is true that quantum mechanics is deterministic. # Therefore, a scientist has made a statement about it. Common examples \\"Some of your key evidence is missing, incomplete, or even faked! That proves I'm right!\\" \\"The vet can't find any reasonable explanation for why my dog died. See! See! That proves that you poisoned him! There‚Äôs no other logical explanation!\\" \\"Adolf Hitler liked dogs. He was evil. Therefore, liking dogs is evil.\\" A Venn diagram illustrating a fallacy: Statement 1: Most of the green is touching the red. Statement 2: Most of the red is touching the blue. Logical fallacy: Since most of the green is touching red, and most of the red is touching blue, most of the green must be touching blue. This, however, is a false statement. In the strictest sense, a logical fallacy is the incorrect application of a valid logical principle or an application of a nonexistent principle: # Most Rimnars are Jornars. # Most Jornars are Dimnars. # Therefore, most Rimnars are Dimnars. This is fallacious. And so is this: # People in Kentucky support a border fence. # People in New York do not support a border fence. # Therefore, people in New York do not support people in Kentucky. Indeed, there is no logical principle that states: # For some x, P(x). # For some x, Q(x). # Therefore, for some x, P(x) and Q(x). An easy way to show the above inference as invalid is by using Venn diagrams. In logical parlance, the inference is invalid, since under at least one interpretation of the predicates it is not validity preserving. People often have difficulty applying the rules of logic. For example, a person may say the following syllogism is valid, when in fact it is not: #All birds have beaks. #That creature has a beak. #Therefore, that creature is a bird. \\"That creature\\" may well be a bird, but the conclusion does not follow from the premises. Certain other animals also have beaks, for example: an octopus and a squid both have beaks, some turtles and cetaceans have beaks. Errors of this type occur because people reverse a premise. In this case, \\"All birds have beaks\\" is converted to \\"All beaked animals are birds.\\" The reversed premise is plausible because few people are aware of any instances of beaked creatures besides birds‚Äîbut this premise is not the one that was given. In this way, the deductive fallacy is formed by points that may individually appear logical, but when placed together are shown to be incorrect.  Non sequitur in everyday speech  In everyday speech, a non sequitur is a statement in which the final part is totally unrelated to the first part, for example: See also     *  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography * Aristotle, On Sophistical Refutations, De Sophistici Elenchi. * William of Ockham, Summa of Logic (ca. 1323) Part III.4. * John Buridan, Summulae de dialectica Book VII. * Francis Bacon, the doctrine of the idols in Novum Organum Scientiarum, Aphorisms concerning The Interpretation of Nature and the Kingdom of Man, XXIIIff. * The Art of Controversy  Die Kunst, Recht zu behalten ‚Äì The Art Of Controversy (bilingual), by Arthur Schopenhauer * John Stuart Mill, A System of Logic ‚Äì Raciocinative and Inductive.

She was named after the Mogami River in T≈çhoku region of Japan. The Mogami-class ships were constructed as \\"light cruisers\\" (per the Washington Naval Treaty) with five triple 155 mm dual purpose guns. They were exceptionally large for light cruisers, and the barbettes for the main battery were designed for quick refitting with twin 8-inch guns. In 1937 all four ships were \\"converted\\" to heavy cruisers in this fashion.Whitley, Cruisers of World War Two, pp. 181-184 Mogami served in numerous combat engagements in World War II, until she was sunk at the Battle of Leyte Gulf in October 1944. Background and design Built under the Maru-1 Naval Armaments Supplement Programme, the Mogami-class cruisers were designed to the maximum limits allowed by the Washington Naval Treaty, using the latest technology. This resulted in the choice of the dual purpose (DP) 15.5 cm/60 3rd Year Type naval guns as the main battery in five triple turrets capable of 55¬∞ elevation. These were the first Japanese cruisers with triple turrets.Patton, Japanese Heavy Cruisers of World War Two, pp. 47-52 Secondary armament included eight 12.7 cm/40 Type 89 naval guns in four twin turrets, and 24 Type 93 Long Lance torpedoes in four rotating triple mounts. To save weight, electric welding was used, as was aluminum in the superstructure, and a single funnel stack. New geared impulse turbine engines, driving four shafts with three-bladed propellers gave a top speed of , which was better than most contemporary cruiser designs and the Mogami class had twin balanced rudders, rather than the single rudder of previous Japanese cruiser designs. The class was designed from the start to be upgraded into heavy cruisers with the replacement of their main battery with 20 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns in twin turrets. However, in initial trials in 1935, Mogami and were plagued with technical problems due to their untested equipment, welding defects, and also proved to be top-heavy with stability problems in heavy weather. Both vessels, and their yet-to-be-completed sisters, and underwent a complete and very costly rebuilding program. Once rebuilt, the design, with its very high speed, armor protection, and heavy armament was among the best in the world during World War II. Service career =Early career= Mogami in July 1935, shortly after commissioning. Mogami was laid down on 27 October 1931, launched on 14 March 1934 and completed at Kure Naval Arsenal on 28 July 1935. Her first captain was Captain Tomoshige Samejima, formerly captain of the cruiser , who oversaw her completion and remained captain until November 1935. He was followed by Captain Seiichi It≈ç, until April 1936. Mogami was commanded by Captain Shunji Isaki from November 1939 to January 1941. In mid-1941, Mogami participated in the occupation of Cochinchina, French Indochina, from its forward operating base on Hainan after Japan and Vichy French authorities reached an understanding on use of air facilities and harbors from July 1941. At the time of the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mogami was assigned to cover the Japanese invasion of Malaya as part of Cruiser Division 7 under Vice Admiral Jisaburo Ozawa's First Southern Expeditionary Fleet, providing close support for landings of Japanese troops at Singora, Pattani and Kota Bharu. In December 1941, Mogami was tasked with the invasion of Sarawak, together with Mikuma, covering landings of Japanese troops at Kuching. In February 1942, Mogami was assigned to cover the landings of Japanese troops in Java, Borneo and Sumatra. On 10 February, Mogami and were attacked by the submarine , which fired four torpedoes, all of which missed. =The Battle of Sunda Strait= At 2300 on 28 February 1942, Mikuma and Mogami, destroyer , light cruiser and destroyers , , , and engaged the cruisers and with gunfire and torpedoes after the Allied vessels attacked Japanese transports in the Sunda Strait. Both Houston and Perth were sunk during the engagement, as was Japanese transport Ry≈´j≈ç Maru with IJA 16th Army commander Lieutenant General Hitoshi Imamura aboard. In March, Mogami and Cruiser Division 7 were based out of Singapore to cover Japanese landings on the Bangka Island off of Sumatra and the seizure of the Andaman Islands. =Indian Ocean Raids= From 1 April 1942 Cruiser Division 7 based from Mergui, Burma joined with Cruiser Division 4 to participate in the Indian Ocean raids against Allied shipping. Mikuma, Mogami and destroyer detached and formed the \\"Southern Group\\", which hunted for merchant shipping in the Bay of Bengal, while Ch≈çkai, Destroyer Squadron 4's light cruiser and the destroyers , , and covered the northern areas. During the operation, the \\"Southern Group\\" claimed kills on the 7,726-ton British passenger ship Dardanus, the 5,281-ton British steamship Ganara, and the 6,622-ton British merchant vessel Indora, en route from Calcutta to Mauritius. On 22 April, Cruiser Division 7 returned to Kure, and Mogami went into dry dock for overhaul. On 26 May, Cruiser Division 7 arrived at Guam to provide close support for Rear Admiral Raiz≈ç Tanaka's Midway Invasion Transport Group. =Battle of Midway= On 5 June, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, CINC of the Combined Fleet ordered Cruiser Division 7 to shell Midway Island in preparation for a Japanese landing. Cruiser Division 7 and DesDiv 8 were away from the island, so they made a high-speed dash at . The sea was choppy and the destroyers lagged behind. At 2120, the order was canceled. However, this dash placed Cruiser Division 7 within torpedo range of the submarine , which was spotted by Kumano, which signaled a 45¬∞ simultaneous turn to starboard to avoid possible torpedoes. The emergency turn was correctly executed by the flagship and Suzuya, but the third ship in the line, Mikuma, erroneously made a 90¬∞ turn. Behind her, Mogami turned 45¬∞ as commanded. This resulted in a collision in which Mogami rammed Mikumas portside, below the bridge. Mogamis bow caved in and she was badly damaged. Mikumas portside oil tanks ruptured and she began to spill oil, but otherwise her damage was slight. and were ordered to stay behind and escort Mogami and Mikuma. At 0534, retiring Mikuma and Mogami were bombed from high altitude by eight USAAF Boeing B-17 Flying Fortresses from Midway, but they scored no hits. At 0805, six USMC Douglas SBD Dauntless dive-bombers and six Vought SB2U Vindicators from Midway attacked Mikuma and Mogami but they only achieved several near-misses.

The following morning, 6 June 1942, Mikuma and Mogami were heading for Wake Island when they were attacked by three waves of 31 SBD Dauntless dive-bombers from the aircraft carriers and . Mikuma was hit by at least five bombs and set afire. Her torpedoes ignited and the resultant explosions destroyed the ship. Arashio and Asashio were each hit by a bomb. Mogami was hit by six bombs. Her No. 5 turret was destroyed and 81 crewmen were killed. However, Lieutenant Commander Masayushi Saruwatari had jettisoned torpedoes and other explosives, making it easier to save the cruiser when it was hit by a bomb near the torpedo tubes. =Respite in Japan= Mogami rejoined Cruiser Division 7 on 8 June and was repaired at Truk. On 20 June, Rear Admiral Shoji Nishimura assumed command of Cruiser Division 7, and Cruiser Division 7 was transferred to the Third Fleet. Mogami returned to Japan, and underwent a major conversion at Sasebo Naval Arsenal from 25 August to an aircraft cruiser to improve the fleet's reconnaissance capabilities. Her No. 4 turret and the damaged No. 5 turret were removed and her aft magazines modified to serve as gasoline tanks and munitions storage. Her aft deck was extended and fitted with a rail system to accommodate the planned stowage of 11 Aichi E16A Zuiun (\\"Paul\\") reconnaissance floatplanes. The dual Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun and Type 93 13-mm machine guns were replaced by 10 triple mount Type 96s and a Type 21 air-search radar. As the new E16A aircraft were not yet available, three older Mitsubishi F1M2 Type 0 (\\"Pete\\") two-seat biplanes and four Aichi E13A1 Type O (\\"Jake\\") three-seat reconnaissance floatplanes were embarked. Rebuilding was completed on 30 April 1943, and Mogami was re-commissioned into the First Fleet. . On 22 May, Mogami collided with oiler Toa Maru in Tokyo Bay and was damaged slightly. On 8 June, while at Hashirajima, Mogami was moored near the battleship when the latter exploded and sank. Mogami sent boats to rescue survivors, but they found none. Japanese planes onboard Mogami's newly installed flight deck. On 9 July 1943, Mogami departed Japan for Truk, with a major convoy of troops and supplies; the task force was unsuccessfully attacked by the submarine , and after reaching Truk, continued on to Rabaul. From August through November, Mogami made numerous sorties from its base at Truk in search of the American fleet and in response to American probing attacks into the Marshall Islands. From 3 November, Cruiser Divisions 4, 7 and 8 were assigned to the Solomon Islands front, to attack American forces off Bougainville. While at anchor at Rabaul on 5 November, Mogami was attacked by a SBD Dauntless dive-bomber from the aircraft carrier and hit by a bomb. She was set on fire and 19 crewmen were killed. After repairs at Truk by the repair vessel , Mogami was ordered back to Japan. While at Kure from 22 December eight more Type 96 single-mount 25-mm AA guns were installed on the aft deck, bringing the total to 38 barrels. Refit was completed by 8 March 1944, and Mogami returned to Singapore a week later. =Battle of the Philippine Sea= Mogami in 1944, after conversion into an aircraft cruiser. On 13 June 1944, Admiral Soemu Toyoda, CINC, Combined Fleet, activated the \\"A-Go\\" plan for the defense of the Mariana Islands. Mogami was assigned to Rear Admiral Takatsugu Jojima's \\"Force B\\" with the carriers , and and battleship , deployed behind Vice Admiral Kurita's \\"Vanguard Force C\\". At 0530 on 19 June, Mogami launched two reconnaissance floatplanes. Later in the day, the Mobile Fleet's aircraft attacked Task Force 58 off Saipan, but suffered overwhelming losses in the \\"Great Marianas Turkey Shoot\\". At 2030 on 20 June, two hours after she was hit by torpedoes by Grumman TBM Avengers from the aircraft carrier , Hiy≈ç exploded and sank. That night, Mogami retired with the remnants of the Japanese fleet to Okinawa, and from there to Hashirajima. Back in Kure on 25 June 1944, Mogami was refitted once again. Four triple-mount and ten single-mount Type 96 25-mm AA guns were installed, bringing the total to 60 barrels (14x3 and 18x1) and a Type 22 surface search radar and Type 13 air-search radar were fitted. On 8 July, Mogami departed Kure via Okinawa and Manila back for Singapore and Brunei, and was involved in fleet training and patrols in the Singapore-Brunei area through October. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= In late October, the Japanese fleet assembled in Brunei in response to the threatened American invasion of the Philippines. In the morning of 24 October 1944, Vice Admiral Nishimura ordered the launch of Mogamis floatplane to reconnoiter Leyte Gulf. The plane reported sighting four battleships, two cruisers and about 80 transports off the landing area and four destroyers and several torpedo boats near Surigao Strait. In addition, the scout reported twelve carriers and ten destroyers southeast of Leyte. The Japanese task force was attacked in the Sulu Sea by 26 aircraft from the carriers and . Mogami was damaged slightly by strafing and rockets. =Battle of the Surigao Strait= On 25 October, between 0300-0330, the Japanese force was attacked by American PT boats and destroyers. Battleships and were hit by torpedoes. The destroyer was sunk, and the destroyer disabled, but Mogami was not hit. Fus≈ç and Yamashiro both later sank. Between 0350‚Äì0402 hours on 25 October, after entering the Surigao Strait, Mogami was struck by four shells from the heavy cruiser , which destroyed both the bridge and the air defense center. Both the captain and executive officer were killed on the bridge, and the chief gunnery officer assumed command. While attempting to retire southward, the flagship of Admiral Shima, , collided with Mogami. Nachis bow was damaged and she began to flood. Mogami was holed starboard above the waterline, but fires ignited five torpedoes that exploded and disabled her starboard engine. Between 0530-0535, the crippled Mogami was hit again by ten to twenty 6-inch and 8-inch shells from the cruisers Portland, and . At 0830, Mogamis port engine broke down. At 0902, while adrift, she was attacked by 17 TBF Avenger torpedo-bombers from Task Group 77.4.1 and was hit by two 500-lb. bombs. At 1047, Mogamis crew abandoned ship, and she stayed afloat for the next two hours. At 1240, the destroyer scuttled her with a single Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedo. She finally sank at 1307, at . Akebono rescued 700 survivors, but 192 crewmen perished with the ship. Mogami was removed from the Navy List on 20 December 1944.

History Toyo Kogyo entered the United States market as Mazda Motor America (MMA) in 1970 with a single car, the RX-2. The next year there were five cars: the compact Familia-based 1200 and R100, the larger Capella-based 616 and RX-2 and the large 1800. For 1972, the line expanded again with the addition of the RX-3 and B1600; the 1200 and 616 were replaced by the similar 808 and 618, respectively; the 1800 was discontinued. The piston-powered 618 was gone the next year, as was the R100, but the 1.2 L 1200 was back for a single year. Mazda quickly rose in prominence, helped in large part to their use of Wankel engines. 1974 was the year of the rotary with the introduction of both the Rotary Pickup and RX-4. In fact, the 808 and B1600 were the only piston- engined Mazdas offered in the United States that year. 1975 had a similar lineup, minus the retired RX-2. Mazda had designed the REPU and RX-4 with the American market in mind, but the energy crisis was looming. The company's sales were slipping due to the Wankel's reputation as a gas hog, so Mazda responded with the reintroduction of a Familia-based car powered by a tiny piston engine, the 1.3 L Mizer. That car, and 1977 GLC (its next-generation brother) saved the company in the United States with favorable reviews and better sales. Also introduced in 1976 was the Wankel-powered RX-5 Cosmo. But the writing was on the wall for Mazda's mainstream Wankel lineup - every one of the older \\"rotary\\" models was cancelled after 1978. Even though the Wankel engine had lost its allure, Mazda persevered with the technology and found a niche for it. The 1979 RX-7 rotary was a halo car, with higher performance than its piston-engined running-mates. Also relaunched that year was the company's entrant in the midsize market, the 626. The RX-7 and 626 buoyed Mazda's American fortunes enough for it to expand. Mazda built an American plant (now Flat Rock Assembly Plant) to build the 626, bringing the company to Ford's attention. The two joined together on the 626's 2-door offshoots, the MX-6 and Ford Probe. Mazda finished the 1980s the same way as the 1970s, with an image-building sports car. The Miata was another halo car for the company, kicking off an industry boom in the sports car segment. The third-generation RX-7, introduced in 1993, was much liked, but few were sold, causing an end of the model's importation just three years later. In early 1992 Mazda planned to release a luxury marque, Amati, to challenge Acura, Infiniti, and Lexus in North America, which was to begin selling in late 1993. The initial Amati range would have included the Amati 300 (which became the (Eunos 500/Xedos 6) in Japan and Europe), the Amati 500 (which became the Eunos 800 in Japan and Australia, Mazda Millenia in the U.S., and Mazda Xedos 9 in Europe) and a luxury sports coupe based on the Mazda Cosmo. Due to the recession of the early 1990s and the effects of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, Amati was cancelled. Mazda consolidated its North American operations as Mazda North American Operations in 1997, and has occupied the current location at 7755 Irvine Center Drive since 1987, having relocated from Compton, California in 1971. Mazda is slated to relocate again to a new office approximately a half-mile south at 200 Spectrum Center Drive in February 2017, across the street from Irvine Spectrum.Mazda moving corporate office In 2007 Mazda recorded their best selling year in the US since 1994 in selling 296,000 vehicles. On December 31, 2015, Jim O'Sullivan retired from president and CEO of Mazda North America. Masahiro Moro, former head of the global sales and marketing division, became CEO.

His first tenure was marked by war against the Persian domination of Georgia. In 1569 he was captured by the Persians, and spent nine years in captivity. In 1578 he was released and reinstalled in Kartli. During this period (i.e. his second tenure), he fought as a Persian subject against the Ottoman domination of Georgia. In 1599 Simon I was captured by the Ottomans and died in captivity. During 1557 to 1569 he was known as Mahmud Khan () and from 1578 to 1599 as Shahnavaz Khan () First reign and struggle against Persia The eldest son of the heroic king Luarsab I of Kartli and Tamar of Imereti, he commanded his father's army at the Battle of Garisi against the Persian invaders, 1556. He was proclaimed by his father co-ruler and heir apparent just prior to the action. Though Luarsab was mortally wounded, the battle was won by Simon, who soon ascended the throne on the death of his father. As the Kartlian capital Tbilisi remained in the Persian hands, Simon had a residence in Gori, whence he ruled over the territories recaptured from the occupiers. In 1559, he allied himself with another Georgian sovereign, Levan I of Kakheti, and married his daughter Nestan-Darejan. Beginning in 1560, Simon launched a series of battles to recover Tbilisi, but in April 1561 suffered a defeat at the Battle of Tsikhedidi, which cost life to his brother- in-law and ally, Prince Giorgi of Kakheti. His brother, David, recently submitted to the Safavid Shah Tahmasp I, converted to Islam, and returned with a Persian army to claim the crown. Simon blockaded Tbilisi and won the battles at Dighomi (1567) and Samadlo (1569), but he was finally defeated and taken prisoner at P'artskhisi, 1569. David, now known as Daud Khan, was made by Persians a tributary king of Kartli. Simon was sent to Persia where he refused to convert to Islam and was imprisoned at the fortress of Alamut for nine years. Second reign and struggle against the Ottomans A battle of Simon with the Erzurum army. A 16th-century Ottoman miniature. The Fortress of the Seven Towers, where Simon died around 1611. When the peace between the Safavids and the Ottomans collapsed and the Turkish general Lala Mustafa Pasha drove the Persians out of Georgia in 1578, it roused the Safavids to come to take further action. Then incumbent Safavid king Mohammad Khodabanda wanted a puppet ruler in Kartli that was popular amongst the local population. Therefore, he ordered for Simon I to be released from prison and offered him the crown of Kartli on the demand that he would convert to Islam. Having been imprisoned for nine years, Simon I's resolve was weakened. In the same year he accepted the Safavid king's demands, and, in order to invade Tbilisi, he received cannon and 5,000 Qizilbash soldiers led by general Ali-Qoli Khan. Simon led a successful guerilla war against the Turks, recovered most of Kartli by 1579, and put a siege to Tbilisi. At the same time, he induced the prince Manuchar II Jaqeli to revolt against the Ottoman rule in Akhaltsikhe, and attempted to get support from Pope Clement VIII, Emperor Rudolph II and Philip II of Spain. The negotiations, however, failed to yield any serious results.Jews, Christians, and Muslims in the Mediterranean World After 1492, p. 85, edited by Alisa M. Ginio, first edition (1992), Routledge, hardcover, . In 1580 Simon I repulsed Ottoman invasion of Kartli, and in 1582 defeated main Ottoman army on the field of Mukhrani, which had a lasting impact as Ottomans were at the height of their power and such a defeat shuttered the myth of their invincibility. Simon I's Persian monolingual seal of the same period reads: \\"Allah, who has no equal, knows that Semiyun (Simon) is a slave of the Shah from the bottom of his heart, 933 (1585)\\". From 1588 to 1590, Simon interfered on three occasions into a power struggle in the western Georgian kingdom of Imereti, and though victorious over Levan of Imereti at the Battle of Gop'anto (1588), he was finally defeated at Op'shkviti and driven out with the help of the Turks. Finally, the Ottomans prevailed and their recently appointed commander, Ferhad Pasha, was able to conquer Kartli by 1588. Simon had to make peace with the Sublime Porte and agreed to pay an annual tribute. By a peace treaty signed in Constantinople on March 21, 1590, the Safavids also recognised all of Georgia as an Ottoman possession. Simon, however, resumed his struggle against the occupants in 1595, and retook Gori after a long-lasting siege in 1599. The sultan Mehmed III sent a large punitive force led by Jafar Pasha, beylerbey of Van. Simon met it at the Battle of Nakhiduri, but he was severely defeated and taken captive while retreating, 1599. Upon the Simon's arrest the Sultan Mehmed III made the following order: Simon was sent to Constantinople where the Georgian noblewoman Gulchara was brought to care for the aged king. He died in 1611 as a prisoner at the Fortress of the Seven Towers (Yedikule) without converting to Sunni Islam, shortly before the cessation of the Ottoman‚ÄìSafavid hostilities. His body was then redeemed by the Georgians and buried at the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral at Mtskheta next to his father. Family and children Simon married in 1559 Nestan-Darejan (died c. 1612), daughter of Levan I of Kakheti.

Little is known of Hygeberht's background, although he was probably a native of Mercia. Offa succeeded in having Lichfield elevated to an archbishopric, but the rise in Lichfield's status was unpopular with Canterbury, the other southern English archbishopric. Offa was probably motivated by a desire to increase the status of his kingdom and to free his kingdom's ecclesiastical affairs from the control of another kingdom's archbishopric, and possibly the need to secure the coronation of Offa's successor, which the Archbishop of Canterbury had opposed. After Offa's death his distant relative Coenwulf became king, and petitioned the pope to have Lichfield returned to a simple bishopric. The pope agreed to do so in 803, by which time Hygeberht was no longer even considered a bishop: he is listed as an abbot at the council that oversaw the demotion of Lichfield in 803. The date of his death is unknown. Background Nothing is known of Hygeberht's ancestry or his upbringing, but given his close ties to the kingdom of Mercia, he was probably a Mercian by birth. He became Bishop of Lichfield in 779.Williams \\"Hygeberht\\" Oxford Dictionary of National Biography At a Mercian council he attended that year at Hartleford he was styled \\"electus praesul\\", or \\"bishop elect\\".Latham Revised Medieval Latin Word List pp. 162 and 370 Two years later he witnessed a charter of Offa's concerning an ecclesiastical claim on a church in Worcester.Godfrey \\"Archbishopric\\" Studies in Church History pp. 147‚Äì148 Perhaps as early as 786 the creation of a Mercian archbishopric was being discussed at Offa's court. A letter to the papacy written by Coenwulf, who succeeded Offa's son Ecgfrith to the Mercian throne, claimed that Offa's motives were his dislike of J√¶nberht, the Archbishop of Canterbury, and of the men of Kent.Witney \\"Period of Mercian Rule\\" Arch√¶ologia Cantiana p. 89 At the Council of Chelsea held in 787, Offa secured the creation of an archbishopric for his kingdom centred on the diocese of Lichfield (in modern Staffordshire).Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 218 Offa may have justified the move by suggesting that J√¶nberht planned to allow the Frankish king Charlemagne to use a landing site in Kent if the latter decided to invade,Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 142 although this is only known from a 13th-century writer, Matthew Paris.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 115‚Äì116 Another concern was probably that of prestige, as having the main Mercian diocese held by an archbishop rather than a bishop would increase the kingdom's status.Ortenberg \\"Anglo-Saxon Church\\" English Church and the Papacy pp. 50‚Äì53 An archbishopric in Mercia would also reinforce the kingdom's independence and free it from ecclesiastical dependence on Canterbury in the kingdom of Kent, which Offa had recently brought under Mercian control.Kirby Making of Early England p. 64 J√¶nberht supported the Kentish king Egbert II, who was not known as a firm supporter of Offa's; an archbishop at Canterbury who was either indifferent or in active opposition to Offa would be an impediment to Offa's ability to establish overlordship of Kent and other areas of England. By elevating another archbishop, Offa would reduce the political power of the archbishops of Canterbury.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 232 Elevation of a bishopric to an archbishopric was not unprecedented; in 735 the papacy had elevated another Anglo-Saxon bishopric to an archbishopric, when Ecgbert became the first Archbishop of York.Godfrey \\"Arcbishopric\\" Studies in Church History p. 145 Council of Chelsea Two different versions of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle record the proceedings of the council. The Peterborough Manuscript (Version E) of the Chronicle records the council under the year 785, although the events took place in 787, and states that \\"here there was a contentious synod at Chelsea and Archbishop J√¶nberht relinquished some part of his bishopric, and Hygeberht was chosen by King Offa, and Ecgfrith consecrated as king.\\"Swanton (trans. and ed.) Anglo-Saxon Chronicle pp. 53, 55 The Canterbury Manuscript (Version F) has the council under 785 also, and describes the council as \\"a full synod sat at Chelsey\\" but otherwise relates much the same events.Swanton (trans. and ed.) Anglo-Saxon Chronicle p. 52 The historian Nicholas Brooks sees the coupling of the elevation of Lichfield with the consecration of Ecgfrith, who was Offa's son, as significant. He argues that Offa desired to have Ecgfrith consecrated as his successor during Offa's lifetime, but was unable to get J√¶nberht to agree, and this was another factor in the creation of Lichfield as an archbishopric.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 118‚Äì119 Hygeberht consecrated Ecgfrith after Hygeberht's elevation to archiepiscopal status.Williams Kingship and Government p. 28 Offa vowed at the council to donate 365 mancuses each year to the papacy, to provide for poor people in Rome and to provide lights for St. Peter's Basilica, stated to be a thanks-offering for his victories. C. J. Godfrey has argued that the donation was really in return for the papal approval of Offa's scheme to elevate the diocese of Lichfield to an archdiocese. Whatever Offa's motivation, historians have generally seen the gift as the beginning of Peter's Pence, an annual \\"tax\\" paid to Rome by the English Church.Godfrey \\"Archbishopric\\" Studies in Church History p. 147 Although it appears that the Council of Chelsea approved Lichfield's elevation to an archdiocese, Hygeberht, who was present, remained a bishop at its conclusion; he signed the council's report still as a bishop. There is no indication that he played any significant part in the council nor in the actions that led to him becoming an archbishop. Archbishop Map showing the dioceses of southern England during Offa's reign. The bold lines show the presumed boundaries between the provinces of Canterbury, Lichfield and York. In 788 Hygeberht traveled to Rome and received a pallium, the symbol of an archbishop's authority, from Pope Hadrian I.Fryde, et al. Handbook of British Chronology p. 218 In one surviving charter of 788 Hygeberht is listed with the title of bishop, but another from late 788 gives him the title of archbishop. More charters from 789 and 792 also give him the title of archbishop, and he continued to be named as such on charters until 799. Throughout the early part of Hygeberht's episcopate, J√¶nberht of Canterbury was the senior archbishop and enjoyed precedence, although after J√¶nberht's death in 792 Hygeberht became the foremost prelate in southern England. It is unknown if J√¶nberht ever acknowledged Hygeberht's elevation as an archbishop, but there is no evidence that J√¶nberht contested the division of his archiepiscopal see and the creation of another archbishopric. Hygeberht consecrated J√¶nberht's successor √Üthelhard, after Offa consulted Alcuin of York about proper procedure.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 225 footnote 1 Hygeberht then was considered the senior prelate in the south of England, as shown by him being listed before √Üthelhard in any charters they both appear on.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury p. 120 Canterbury retained as suffragans, or subordinates, the bishops of Winchester, Sherborne, Selsey, Rochester, and London. The dioceses of Worcester, Hereford, Leicester, Lindsey, Dommoc and Elmham were transferred to Lichfield.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 144 This listing, however, comes from the Gesta pontificum Anglorum of the later medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury, written in about 1120. Although the division is logical, William confuses Hygeberht with Hygeberht's successor Ealdwulf, and does not give a source for his list, which suggest that it may be untrustworthy. The creation of a third archbishopric was controversial, and the community at Canterbury Cathedral seems never to have accepted Hygeberht as an archbishop. The historian D. P. Kirby speculates that there were always some in the Mercian kingdom who disapproved of the elevation of Lichfield to an archdiocese.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 143 During Hygeberht's archbishopric, joint synods for the provinces of Lichfield and Canterbury were held, presided over by both archbishops. These gatherings were canonically irregular, as the usual procedure was for each province to hold its own synod. The reasons for holding joint councils are unclear; they may have been a manifestation of Offa's desire to supervise the entire southern church, or an attempt by the archbishops of Canterbury to retain some authority over the province of Lichfield.Cubitt Anglo-Saxon Church Councils p. 218 Offa died in July 796 and his son Ecgfrith 141 days later. Coenwulf, a distant relative, succeeded to the Mercian throne after Ecgfrith's death.Kirby Earliest English Kings p. 148 Soon after his accession Coenwulf sought to replace the two archdioceses with one at London,Stenton Anglo-Saxon England p. 226 arguing that Pope Gregory I's original plan had been that there be an archbishopric at London instead of at Canterbury. In 797 and 798 Coenwulf sent envoys to Rome to Pope Leo III, suggesting that a new archdiocese be created at London for √Üthelhard. The king's envoys laid the blame for the problems encountered with the Lichfield archdiocese on Pope Hadrian I's incompetence. Displeased by criticism of the papacy, Leo ruled against the king's plan. In 801 Coenwulf put down a Kentish rebellion, allowing him to once more assert his authority in Canterbury and control the archbishopric. Finally, in 802, Pope Leo III granted that Hadrian's decision was invalid, after the English clergy told him it had been achieved by Offa's misrepresentation. Leo returned all jurisdiction to Canterbury, a decision announced by √Üthelhard at the Council of Clovesho in 803.Stenton Anglo-Saxon England pp. 227‚Äì228 Resignation and death Hygeberht had resigned his see before Lichfield was demoted back to a bishopric.Kirby Earliest English Kings pp. 144‚Äì145 He was still named as archbishop in 799, but evidence suggests that he no longer controlled all of the suffragan bishops that he once had. Possibly, he was replaced at Lichfield; his successor Ealdwulf attended a council in 801, and was named bishop in the council's records. By the time that √Üthelhard held another council at Clovesho in 803, Hygeberht was no longer even named as a bishop, and appears at that council as an abbot.Brooks Early History of the Church of Canterbury pp. 125‚Äì126 Which abbey he was abbot of, and his exact date of death, are unknown. Hygeberht's contemporary at Canterbury, √Üthelhard, was the first Archbishop of Canterbury to require an affirmation of faith from his subordinate bishops when they were elected. The historian Eric John argues that this custom began because of the creation of the archbishopric of Lichfield.John Reassessing Anglo-Saxon England p. 61 Notes Citations References     * * External links * Category:8th- century archbishops Category:Anglo-Saxon bishops of Lichfield Category:Year of birth unknown Category:9th-century deaths ","title":"Hygeberht"},{"id":"3637984","text":"John Tyler Community College is a public community college in Chester, Virginia.

The Rohini series consisted of four satellites, each of which was launched by the Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV) and three of which made it successfully to orbit. The series were mostly experimental satellites. Satellites in series =Rohini Technology Payload (RTP)= It was a experimental spin stabilized satellite that used 3W of power and was launched on 10 August 1979 from SDSC. The satellite contained instruments to monitor the launch vehicle. It did not achieve its intended orbit as the carrier rocket SLV was only 'partially successful'. =RS-1= It was also a experimental spin stabilized satellite that used 16W of power and was successfully launched on 18 July 1980 from Satish Dhawan Space Centre into an orbit of with an inclination of 44.7¬∞. It was the first satellite successfully launched by the indigenous launch vehicle SLV. It provided data on the fourth stage of SLV. The satellite had mission life of 1.2 years and an orbital life of 20 months. =RS-D1= It was a experimental spin stabilized satellite that used 16W of power and was launched on 31 May 1981. The launch of the SLV was a partial success as the satellite did not reach the intended height and thus it only stayed in orbit for 9 days. It achieved an orbit of with an inclination of 46¬∞. The satellite carried a solid state camera for remote sensing applications (Landmark Tracker) and performed to specifications. =RS-D2= It was a experimental spin stabilized satellite that used 16W of power and was launched successfully on 17 April 1983 into an orbit of and an inclination of 46¬∞. The satellite was in operation (mission life) for 17 months and its main payload, a smart sensor camera, took over 2500 pictures. The camera had the capability to take pictures both in visible and infrared bands. After an orbital life of 7 years, the satellite reentered the Earth atmosphere on 19 April 1990.

Adalgis or Adelchis (died 788) was an associate king of the Lombards from August 759, reigning with his father, Desiderius, until their deposition in June 774. His mother was Ansa. He is also remembered today as the hero of the play Adelchi (1822) by Alessandro Manzoni. In Desiderius' attempts to rekindle an alliance between the Lombards and Carolingians he proposed that Adalgis should marry Charlemagne's sister Gisela. Bachrach has suggested that this proposal was to undermine the Carolingian's relationship with the papacy. When in 773 the Lombard kingdom was invaded by Charlemagne, the king of the Franks, Desiderius stayed in Pavia, the capital, where he unsuccessfully resisted a siege. Adalgis instead took refuge in Verona, where he sheltered the widow and children of Charlemagne's younger brother, Carloman I, who had entered an Italian monastery after abdicating the kingship. Even before the fall of Pavia, when the Frankish army approached Verona, Adalgis did not resist. He escaped to Constantinople, where he was received by the Eastern Roman emperor Constantine V, who raised him to the patriciate. Adalgis hoped to return to re-conquer Italy, and solicited help from Duke Arechis II of Benevento for this purpose. Many Lombards refused to submit to Frankish rule, believing that Adalgis's return was imminent.Ottorino Bertolini, \\"Adelchi, re dei Longobardi\\", Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani 1 (1960). The historian Paul the Deacon reflected a widespread belief among the Lombards when he wrote, as part of his poetic epigraph for the tomb of Ansa, that \\"in her, by Christ, the greatest hope of the Lombards spent a time.\\"\\"In quo per Christum Bardis spes maxima mansit\\", in the Epitaphium Ansae reginae. Einhard, Charlemagne's biographer, also records that \\"on [Adalgis] all hope seemed to incline\\" (in quem spes omnium inclinatae videbantur). Only in 787, after the efforts of the Empress Irene to obtain the hand in marriage of Charlemagne's daughter Rotrude for her son, Constantine VI, did the Romans move to give Adalgis the military assistance he required. An expeditionary corps was placed under the command of the saccellarius and logotheta Ioannes and augmented by troops from Sicily under the patrikios Theodoros. The Roman army landed in Calabria towards the end of 788, but was met by the united armies of the Lombard dukes Hildeprand of Spoleto and Grimoald III of Benevento, who had succeeded his father, Arechis, and made peace with the Franks. These Lombard forces were accompanied by Frankish troops under Winiges. In the ensuing battle the Romans were defeated, but there is no further record of the fate of Adalgis.

Charlie is a recurring character, introduced in March 1986 as the estranged husband of Dot Cotton (June Brown). He appears in stints until producers made the decision to kill the character off-screen in 1991, to aid development of characters connected to him. June Brown, who plays Dot, was openly against the killing of Charlie. Charlie appears one last time, in the October 2000 spin-off, Return of Nick Cotton, as an apparition, warning his son Nick (John Altman) to change his ways. Storylines Charlie deserted Dot Cotton (June Brown) in the late 1950s after two years of marriage when she was expecting their son, Nick (John Altman). He then had an affair with her sister, Rose Taylor (Polly Perkins) and fathered another son, Andrew (Ricky Grover) with her. He returns to the Square in 1986 after nearly 30 years away and cons Dot into believing he has come back for good and changed his ways and then disappears as soon as he has some of her money. In 1987, he meets Nick (now in his late twenties) for the first time when they both coincidentally visit Dot. Charlie and Nick hate each other and both try to get rid of each other so they can con Dot. Charlie discovers Nick has cheated some of his friends out of money and has been involved in some house burglaries and that is why he is hiding at Dot's house. He uses this to try to get rid of him by teaming with Graham Clark (Gary Webster), an old friend of Nick, and wants to get back at him for going to prison for Nick's crime. Graham forces Nick to leave Walford but before Nick leaves, he tells Dot that Charlie grassed him to the people who were looking for him. Dot gets angry and tells Charlie to leave too. Charlie resurfaces in 1989 after breaking his leg and imposes himself on Dot once again. During this time, he exposes Hazel's (Vriginial Fiol) deception about being married to Nick and having his child, which devastates Dot who is enjoying being a grandmother. Joan Leggett (Rhoda Lewis) comes looking for Charlie several weeks later and tells Dot about their bigamous marriage. Charlie's double life is exposed and it is revealed he had told Joan his name was Tommy. After being confronted by both women and humiliated in the pub, Charlie flees. He returns the next year to con Dot out of her bingo money and he finds that Nick is already plotting to steal her winnings by poisoning her, but Nick soon backs out with the persuasion of Charlie. Unfortunately just when Charlie is trying to tell Dot that Nick is going to poison her and he stops him, Dot tells him to leave once again, not believing that Nick would do such a thing. Nick then leaves the Square after saying goodbye to Dot and her and Charlie have one final drink in the Vic before he gets his things at the B&B; and leaves the Square for good. In July 1991, Dot receives news that Charlie has died in a lorry accident but his death is not shown on-screen. However, in October 2000 he returns briefly as a ghost in Nick's dream in a special spin-off episode The Return of Nick Cotton. He warns Nick that something terrible is about to happen. This proves somewhat prophetic as Nick's teenage son, Ashley (Frankie Fitzgerald) is killed in a motorcycle accident some months later. More than a decade later, Rose reveals to Dot she married Charlie and confirms he was the father of her son, Andrew, meaning Charlie was a polygamist. Dot blames Rose for Charlie's disloyalty and initially refuses to speak to or acknowledge her, but Rose convinces Dot that Charlie was lying to both of them and he is not worth wasting her energy on. Creation and development Charlie Cotton, the husband of Dot Cotton (June Brown), is a semi-regular character who comes and goes throughout his duration in the show; he joined in 1986, 13 months after the soap's launch. Depicted as bigamous and a conman, Charlie typically reappears in the show whenever he needs money or temporary accommodation and, because of Dot's Christian ideals regarding forgiveness, Charlie is always be permitted to return. According to Christopher Hancock, Charlie is \\"a truly revolting character, a loser\\" and the character has been described as a \\"despicable small-time villain [...] lazy and pathetic\\". Author Kate Lock has described Charlie as a \\"sly, shifty, weaselly man\\". In order to become the character of Charlie, Hancock wore stick-on sideburns. Producers decided to kill Charlie off in 1991; Charlie died off-screen after having a motor accident in his lorry. The decision to kill Charlie was taken in order to reintroduce Charlie's son, Nick (John Altman). Nick had been involved in a storyline that saw him attempt to poison Dot in 1990, and producers felt that in order for Dot to allow Nick back into her life again, something major had to occur in her narrative, that being the death of her husband. Storyline editor, Andrew Holden, has discussed this in the EastEnders Handbook publication in 1991: \\"We wanted to bring Nick Cotton back and we also wanted to push Dot forward and change her life. But the problem was how? The last time we saw Nick he was attempting to kill his mother. Dot isn't a fool so we knew getting them back together was like a three card trick. How do we get out of this? So we made [Nick] a heroin addict. That made him vulnerable, in a mess and needing his mother to get money for him. We then had to kill Charlie because I figured that only in a state of shock and uncertainty about her belief in God would Dot contemplate forgiving Nick and attempting to reform him. She decides to believe that she can make a decent human being of Nick. She feels it's her last chance. As a widow Dot enters new territory. Dot's snobbery is based on ludicrous misconceptions, one of which is that she is better than [her friend] Ethel because she has a husband. She is going to have a lot of scope [...] Dot's life is going to change.\\" Actress June Brown was opposed to the killing of Charlie and she attempted to get the programme makers to change their minds. She comments, \\"I was very unhappy to learn that Charlie would be killed off. I would have preferred if they'd left the door open for him to possibly return one day. I went to see the writers and put this forward. I suggested that there could be some uncertainty about the body. Charlie may have picked up a hitch-hiker and he was the one who died. John Altman, who plays Nick, was also sorry about Charlie. We weren't thinking just about Christopher Hancock, who played Charlie so well, it was that we liked the character and it seemed a waste. But I was too late, I couldn't change their minds. In the past I have talked things through and I was listened to\\". The episode Dot is told about Charlie‚Äôs death, written by Linda Dearsley, aired on 11 July 1991, and was dominated by Dot's reaction to Charlie's death and her trip to identify his body. It is selected by writer Colin Brake as one of 1991's episodes of the year. The character appears one last time, brought back as an apparition/ghost, in a dream sequence experienced by Nick in 2000. The episode is entitled EastEnders: The Return of Nick Cotton. Christopher Hancock, the actor who portrayed Charlie, died four years later.

Webb has taken maternity leave three times, with the first time being in 2010 before returning in 2011, and the second throughout 2016 with Debbie departing on 1 January 2016. She returned on 24 January 2017 and then went on maternity leave for a third time in 2019 as Debbie left for Scotland on 13 August 2019. She was introduced as the foster child of Paddy Kirk (Dominic Brunt) and Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor) before being revealed as the estranged daughter of Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins) and Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley). She has featured in many storylines on Emmerdale including her relationships with Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher), which lead to her pregnancy at 15, Jasmine Thomas (Jenna Louise Coleman) and Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman), her daughter Sarah being diagnosed with a blood disorder, her disastrous relationship with Cameron Murray (Carl King's, Gennie Walker's and Alex Moss's real killer) (Dominic Power), which sparked the 2013 week of episodes known as \\"The Woolpack Siege,\\"; a relationship with Pete (Anthony Quinlan), who she later marries and her affair with Ross (Michael Parr), a relationship with Tom Waterhouse later revealed as Joe Tate (Ned Porteous) and being conned by him but later forgiving him and getting back together, accidentally having Ross as the victim of an acid attack, learning Sarah suffers from heart failure and needs a transplant, and dealing with the false revelation that Cain killed Joe (although it was later revealed that he is alive). Storylines Upon arriving in Emmerdale in December 2002, Debbie is fostered by Paddy (Dominic Brunt) and Emily Kirk (Kate McGregor). When Debbie shows Sam Dingle (James Hooton) a photograph of her biological mother, he recognizes the young woman, Charity Dingle (Emma Atkins). They eventually meet and she gets close to her stepfather, Chris Tate (Peter Amory), but after meeting her biological father, Cain Dingle (Jeff Hordley), the trio become a family and Chris is sidelined. This affects him extremely, resulting in him cancelling plans to adopt Debbie. Debbie, Charity and Cain move into Pear Tree Cottage and live together until Charity is found guilty of Chris's murder, so she and Cain move in with the Dingles. When the house becomes over-crowded, she and Cain move in with Andy Sugden (Kelvin Fletcher) and Daz Eden (Luke Tittensor). Debbie's behaviour becomes erratic as she shows an interest in glamour and boys, resulting in her capturing Daz's affections. Debbie, however, prefers Andy and local curate, Ethan Blake (Liam O'Brien), who is engaged to Niamh O'Connor (Tracey Moore). Debbie loses her virginity to Andy and he tells her that he has a crush on her. They begin dating, until Charity and Cain find out. Charity accepts the relationship but Cain disapproves and blackmails Andy into ending it, unaware that Debbie is pregnant. Andy's wife Katie Sugden (Sammy Winward) had discover her affair with Andy and was pregnant with his child, causing angry at her and nearly divorce with him. Distraught, she hides it and plans to abandon the baby after giving birth but Daz sees her bump. Daz is with her as she gives birth and names her daughter, Sarah. Debbie and Andy reunite briefly but it is short-lived and his brother, Robert Sugden (Karl Davies), becomes romantically involved with Debbie. She, however, is unaware that he has an ulterior motive until he ends the relationship when Debbie tells him that she feels baby Sarah should stay with the Dingles while they go travelling. He then tells her that he wanted Sarah, not her. Feeling unable to cope with motherhood and knowing that Emily is leaving, she asks her to take Sarah. The Dingles are horrified so she moves in with Ashley Thomas (John Middleton), where she makes friends with Jasmine Thomas (Jenna-Louise Coleman). Debbie confesses her love for Jasmine and they date for a while until Cain deliberately tempts Jasmine into sleeping with him. Wanting to hurt her, he makes sure Debbie sees them together. Debbie and Jasmine break up for a while but reconcile when Debbie learns that Jasmine is pregnant and wants an abortion. Sadie King (Patsy Kensit), pitying Jasmine, pays for her to go private and Debbie, knowing that Cain wants another child, tells him this, leading him to kidnap Sadie and Tom King (Ken Farrington) for financial gain to start a new life. Debbie tries to convince Cain to stay but he leaves and gives her some money. Emily returns Sarah to Andy and Debbie tells Andy that she does not want to be a mother. Lisa Dingle (Jane Cox) deliberately asks Debbie to visit when Sarah is there, hoping to create a mother-daughter relationship. She's successful and Debbie asks Andy for access but he refuses. Debbie starts dating Scott Windsor (Ben Freeman) but that ends when Scott leaves. Debbie gets Eli Dingle (Joe Gilgun) to pose as Scott so she can get a bank loan. Debbie, Chas Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Lexi King (Sally Oliver) decide to stage a jewellery scam at Home Farm so they can steal a valuable necklace and share the proceeds. Debbie wants more money so she gets Eric Pollard (Chris Chittell) to help scam Chas and Lexi but Lexi discovers the truth and the pair fight in the street, accidentally dropping the necklace down a drain. When Andy is sent to prison, Jo Stiles (Roxanne Pallett), Andy's wife, asks Debbie to look after Sarah, which Debbie enjoys. Debbie discovers that Andy is hitting Jo and worries about Sarah's safety, especially after she is suspended from nursery for biting another child. Debbie gives Jo money so she and Sarah can leave but Jo stays and allows Andy to see Sarah again, annoying Debbie. However, this does not last long as Jo leaves Sarah with Debbie and the Dingles as Debbie gets involved in the murder of PC Shane Doyle (Paul McEwan), Jasmine's ex- boyfriend. Jasmine is the real culprit as she attacks Shane when he attacks Debbie and kills him. She, Debbie and Eli then attempted to conceal what they'd done but Jasmine wants to confess especially after Ross Kirk (Samuel Anderson) is charged with his murder. Debbie persuades her not to and they start dating again. They decide to run away together but the police catch Debbie and arrest her. With Jasmine on the run; Debbie is left to take the blame for the murder. Eli enlists Danielle Hutch to harm Debbie, so she is sent to hospital as part of a rescue attempt but Debbie refuses to go. At Debbie's court hearing, Jasmine arrives and admits murdering Shane. Debbie and Jasmine are found guilty and Debbie is released because of time served and her time in prison has made her realize that she wants Sarah back.

They emotionally blackmail Cameron and Alicia to agree by telling them that they'd do the same if their child was seriously ill. When they are refused IVF and artificial insemination attempts are unsuccessful, Debbie sleeps with Andy and is overjoyed to discover that she is pregnant but Cameron has had enough and leaves. Charity, thinking it was artificial insemination, persuades him to give Debbie another chance but Andy tells Cameron the truth. On learning this, Debbie begs Cameron to stay, for Sarah's sake as well as hers. Andy and Debbie learn that the baby is a match for Sarah after a CVS test. Cameron and Debbie eventually reunite after Debbie admits he is the only person she has ever truly loved. Andy is hurt but comes to terms with the situation when Debbie learns that she is expecting a baby boy while Cameron starts an affair with Chas. A few months into her pregnancy, Sarah asks if she, Debbie and Andy can go to Paris. Cameron wants to go but lets Andy take his ticket, claiming that he is going to Jersey to see his kids but goes away with Chas. Cain is suspicious when Cameron's son rings, looking for him. A few weeks later, Debbie is shocked when Cain reveals his suspicions about Cameron and realizes that she has doubts too. When Debbie and Cain confront Cameron, he lashes out at Cain but accidentally hits Debbie. She hits her head and fears she may lose her baby. Fortunately the baby is fine. Back home, Sarah asks if her brother still has \\"the magic potion\\" to save her and Debbie is tearful as she realizes how much Sarah wants her brother and how hurt she would be if anything happened to him. This, however, brings Cameron to his senses as he realizes how much he loves Debbie. Debbie is angry when Cameron forgets to check on Sarah when she is ill because he is on the phone to Carl about the ¬£30,000 Carl is blackmailing them for. Meanwhile, Debbie gets home from shopping with Charity to find that Sarah has collapsed. When rushed to hospital, Debbie, Cameron, Charity and Victoria discover Sarah is in a pre-leukaemic state. Debbie demands to be induced but is refused, as her son will be premature, and could die. In Emmerdales live episode to celebrate its 40th anniversary, Debbie gave birth to a baby boy called Jack, after Andy's adopted father. When Debbie returns from hospital, she is unaware that Cameron killed Carl King (Tom Lister) the night before. Debbie finds 6 new messages from Carl on her phone, 3 pictures and 3 texts of Cameron sleeping with Chas so Debbie threw Cameron out before showing the pictures to Cain and Charity. Cameron begged Chas to leave but they were stopped by Charity, Cain, Debbie and Zak. The police were called and Cain and Charity were arrested for breach of the peace. Chas confessed to Carl's murder and she was arrested. Cain and Charity were released without charge but Chas was charged with Carl's murder, despite pleading guilty to manslaughter. Cameron stood by Chas and declared his love for her in front of Debbie. As revenge, Debbie set fire to his possessions and trashed his truck. Cameron declared his love for Chas in the pub in front of Dan and Charity. Charity and Cain then swore to get revenge for Debbie. Debbie feels she needs to provide more for baby Jack and Sarah after Sarah begins her chemotherapy after her transplant and decides to set up a delivery firm, sleeping with newcomer Dom (Wil Johnson) to get his contacts. After it is revealed that Dom's boss, Pete, does drug work, he tries to get Debbie to do drugs runs for him and threatens Sarah, so Debbie terminates the contract. Debbie hires Robbie Lawson (Jamie Shelton) as her assistant and they begin selling cheap vodka. Their biggest orders were from Eric and Val Pollard (Charlie Hardwick) and Debbie even tries to rip off Chas in The Woolpack. When the seller's price goes up, Debbie and Robbie set up a meeting with an old friend of Robbie's, Kirk, who is very interested in Debbie. Whilst Debbie is meeting Kirk, Jack and Sarah almost die when Andy's girlfriend, Kerry Wyatt (Laura Norton), accidentally sets fire to Dale View. Debbie swore to pay Kerry back and almost kills her in the street. Kirk's interest in Debbie continues even though Robbie reveals he is engaged to a woman named Charlene. Kirk states that Charlene will have him for the rest of their lives and he deserves to have Debbie while he can and kisses her. Debbie becomes wary, remembering previous times with engaged men, like Michael. Debbie gets closer to Belle and is horrified when Belle drinks half a bottle of her dodgy vodka and is left with possible brain damage. The Dingles throw Debbie out and Andy takes the children away. She stays with Zak, gets her life back on track and gets closer to Cameron when he comforts her. Cameron feels sorry for Debbie when Andy takes the children, leading to them kissing briefly. Cameron persuades Debbie not to run away with Jack and Sarah because everyone has turned against her. Cameron feels a strong vibe towards her and accidentally, the pair sleep together. Just after sleeping with Cameron, he tells Debbie \\"that it felt right\\" in his opinion, and she is horrified that he wants her to cheat on Chas, like he did to her. Debbie denies it and says that it was a stupid mistake and that all she cares about is her kids before telling Cameron to leave but Debbie knows she still loves him. Cameron continues to fight for Debbie and after she angrily admits trying to kill Chas, Cameron realizes that it took a lot for her to confess, so he thinks she still trusts him. He follows her home from the caf√©, unaware that Gennie is hidden upstairs with a dictophone, taping their conversation. Cameron confesses that he killed Carl. Debbie says she still loves him and they can get through it together, as she believed that he was with Chas while she was giving birth to Jack, but realizes that Cameron was \\"threatened\\" by Carl and killed him in \\"self- defence\\". Debbie and Cameron kiss and head to tell Chas they are back together and while kissing in the street, they notice Gennie leave Tug Ghyll. The pair chase her, leading to Gennie's car crashing down a ravine. Cameron pulls a hurt Gennie out of the car while Debbie calls an ambulance.

When Cameron's murderous crimes are exposed by Debbie and Chas after finding Gennie's Dictaphone. Panicked and betrayed, Cameron holds Debbie hostage and threatens to have her killed but he is injured when he falls down the stairs. Debbie escapes and embraces Cain and Charity while Cameron is arrested and charged with the murders of Carl, Alex and Gennie. A month later, he manages to escape for jail and buys a ferry ticket so people would assume he'd left the country but he stays in Yorkshire. When Debbie, Chas and the other villagers learn of his escape, they panic, with Debbie fearing the worst. Later on, Cameron takes Sarah and locks her in a barn, assuring her he will get Debbie and Jack, and go away as a family. She believes him but when Zak and Moira are alerted of her disappearance, they look for her. Debbie and other villagers including Chas are in The Woolpack when she learns Sarah has been found by Andy and Moira, but Cameron is back and breaks into the Woolpack, taking everyone hostage. He knocks Marlon unconscious and leaves him in the cellar, where the flood water rises. Cameron accidentally shoots Alicia, and David Metcalfe (Matthew Wolfenden) begs Cameron to let her out, so she can get medical assistance. He lets them and the other villagers out, except Debbie and Chas. After being hit by Marlon after he regained consciousness, Debbie and Chas rush to the cellar, followed by Cameron. He insists that he and Debbie will drown together but Debbie and Chas manage to escape. Trying to pull Debbie back in, he fails but grabs a light bulb and electrocutes himself. He is finally killed, ending his wrath and getting his comeuppance. Debbie rushes to Zak, soaking wet and crying as he reassures her Cameron is where he belongs ‚Äì in hell, ending the Woolpack siege and Cameron's life. Debbie moves on from Cameron after a new employee at Dingle Automotives, Ross Barton (Michael Parr), makes a clumsy pass at her, she attacks him when he touches her arm. He constantly attempts to impress her but always fails. When his brother, Pete (Anthony Quinlan), thinks Ross is harassing her, he attacks Ross. An angry Ross later sets up Pete's car so he cannot go to a meeting, so Debbie comes out in the recovery vehicle.

Debbie is found under collapsed debris and fights for her life, as Pete and Cain carry her out of the rubble. Ross escapes from Cain's van and sees Pete putting an unconscious Debbie into the car. He goes to the hospital and asks Pete whether she is alive. He does not respond, worrying Ross. Debbie, however, is on life support and wakes up later. Unknown to her, Pete has knocked Ross unconscious in a fight. Fearing that Ross is dead, Pete conceals him and returns to visit Debbie in hospital. She begs for Pete's forgiveness and holds out her hand expecting Pete to hold it, to which he does, and tells her to forget Ross. Debbie later comes home but Pete cannot cope with his guilt and tells Debbie he killed Ross, shocking her and she compares him to Cameron. Ross, however, is later seen alive in a hospital bed, determined to win back Debbie. They later begin a relationship. Debbie leaves on New Year's Day 2016 after learning Ross shot Robert (now played by Ryan Hawley) and Andy was involved. In October 2016, Debbie decides to sell the business and her home to Chrissie, apparently deciding also not to come back to the village.

The men get their money and return Sarah and Jack in a tense standoff. Debbie breaks down later that night - she needs the money for Sarah's medical treatment as she has been diagnosed with cancer. When Debbie's grandmother Faith comes back to Emmerdale she donates money for Sarah's treatment. Debbie tells everyone that she is taking Sarah to Prague for her treatment, which is met with her families doubt on whether she will make it out of the country without being arrested. As a result, Charity plans on taking Sarah instead of Debbie.

He starts feuding with the Dingles saying he never loved Debbie and she soon learns that Tom has invested in a golf course that will be built on the Dingles' cottage which Joe demolishes. Debbie pays drug dealer Simon McManus (Liam Ainsworth) to physically attack Joe and when Simon sees Ross stepping out of Joe's car, he believes Ross is Joe and throws acid in Ross' face, however Debbie begins a relationship with Joe. Ross later shoots Debbie and after she fights for her life in hospital she becomes stable and confesses to Ross that she was the person behind his acid attack. Casting Charley Webb was cast as Debbie Dingle aged fourteen years old as Charity and Cain's daughter in 2002. She made her first on screen appearance on Christmas Eve the same year. Development =Characterisation= Webb told Gemma Graham from TV Buzz that the reason she \\"loves\\" playing Debbie is the fact she has always been a fighter. \\"Nothing will knock her down and if it does she'll get back up again\\". Webb said that she would not pick a fight with Debbie because she would win \\"any day\\". In one storyline Debbie takes part in a jewellery heist with the help of Chastity Dingle (Lucy Pargeter) and Lexi Nicholls (Sally Oliver). Lexi is given a bracelet at a sale and pretends she has stolen it to impress Debbie. Oliver told Kris Green of Digital Spy that Debbie thinks that stealing jewellery must be easy. Debbie thinks of a \\"big master plan\\" and they attend a party at Home Farm. The three females \\"dress up-the-nines\\" in \\"camp costumes\\".

Debbie's attitude causes Lexi to become suspicious; Oliver said that Lexi \\"wants the necklace straight back, it's not the sort of thing she's going to take lightly.\\" Debbie starts plotting to sell the necklace and keep the proceeds for herself. Oliver said Debbie swaps the necklace for a fake and makes Chas and Lexi think she has lost it. The production team did not use real diamonds in the storyline and opted for plastic glass. Oliver said that she did not think they would get away with the scam. =Get-rich-quick scheme= On 28 December 2012, Tom Eames, from Digital Spy, confirmed Emmerdale character Debbie Dingle would reportedly attempt to inherit people's fortune by conning them in an upcoming plot. Following recent clutches at the hands of unfaithful boyfriend Cameron Murray (Dominic Power), Debbie will use her family's history ‚Äì Charity Dingle and Cain Dingle ‚Äì of con schemes to receive financial gain in order to provide for her children Sarah Sugden and Jack Sugden. \\"Debbie's on a mission and she's taking no prisoners!\\" an Emmerdale insider told Inside Soap. \\"Heartbroken she might be, but she has no intention of sitting about moping. Debbie will be putting her Dingle skills to maximum use as she prepares to set her plan in motion. \\"Her initial target is Dom, but once it becomes clear Debbie will stop at nothing in order to get her way, Cain and Charity start to wonder whether their daughter might be out of control.\\" Webb commented on her character's new appearance, during the scheme: She becomes very business-minded, almost overnight. She suddenly goes through this massive change, to her looks and her hair. \\"It's all about earning money for the kids. She's determined that no-one will ever be able to screw her over again.\\" \\"She's watched her mum and dad do what they want and get what they want for years. Now she's saying, 'That's it ‚Äì I'm like you'. \\"Even Charity's shocked, but Debbie's got a one-track mind at the moment. She just wants to become a mini-Cain. The Cameron thing has left her completely broken, and this is the only way she can get through it. She's putting on a mask and pretending everything's okay.\\" =Wedding crash and explosion= In July 2015, a trailer was aired stating that some major characters were to be killed off, this was confirmed in August to be a helicopter crash and an explosion, Debbie is the central character in the storyline as it happens as she is marrying Pete. A special week of episodes involving the wedding, the explosion and the helicopter crash aired from 3 August 2015, and the helicopter crash leaves Debbie fighting for her life. =Temporary departures= In June 2015, Webb announced she was pregnant with her second child and took her maternity leave later that year. Debbie departed on 1 January 2016 and it was confirmed in December 2016 that Webb will make her return in January 2017. Her return scenes aired on 24 January 2017. She will be taking maternity leave for a third time in mid-2019 after Webb revealed she was pregnant in February 2019, her character left for Scotland on 13 August 2019. Reception Charley Webb portrays Debbie. For her portrayal of Debbie, Webb won the \\"Best Young Actor\\" award at the 2005 Inside Soap Awards. In 2007, Webb was nominated for \\"Best Actress\\" at the British Soap Awards and the Inside Soap Awards. On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, Chas and Cameron's affair and the subsequent effect on Debbie was voted fourth in the \\"Best Storyline\\" category, receiving 8.9% of the vote. Webb told Gemma Graham from TV Buzz that the reason she \\"loves\\" playing Debbie is the fact she has always been a fighter. \\"Nothing will knock her down and if it does she'll get back up again\\". Webb said that she would not pick a fight with Debbie because she would win \\"any day\\". Webb was nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" award and the \\"Villain of the Year\\" award at The British Soap Awards 2013, and has been nominated for the \\"Best Actress\\" award again in 2014. Kris Green of Digital Spy said that he thought the jewellery heist storyline was inspired by the 2000 Millennium Diamond heist. A writer from Holy Soap said \\"this tough cookie has had an eventful life, despite her tender years\\" and named Debbie's most \\"memorable moment\\" as being imprisoned for Shane's murder. In 2011, Gemma Graham of TV Buzz said that Webb had spent ten years in British living rooms playing Debbie. They said she is a character that has received numerous blows because she is a Dingle ‚Äì but always came back fighting. If anyone needed a character from Emmerdale to fight their battles, Graham said that Debbie would be their choice. Of her attitude Graham added, \\"There's barely a soul in the soap's village who hasn't received a tongue-lashing from our Debs at one time or other. Quite honestly, she even puts the fear of God into us.\\" Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap said that Debbie was not happy with Cameron nor Andy, \\"judging by the amount of time she spends looking miserable.\\" Roz Laws of the Sunday Mercury branded Debbie as an \\"ice queen\\". However despite this popularity, Debbie has courted distaste from fans due to her sometimes difficult personality and the show's apparent lack of acknowledgement of her bisexuality, a move which has frustrated a lot of the show's LGBTQ+ fan base.

In 1939 she was laid down as the merchant ship Rio-Hudson at the Sun Shipbuilding & Drydock Company yard in Chester, Pennsylvania. Launched on 27 November 1940, she was converted to an escort carrier and transferred under the lend lease agreement to the Royal Navy. She was commissioned on 2 March 1942. Avengers capacity allowed for a maximum of 15 aircraft. In September 1942, she took part in what was the largest and most successful Russian convoy to date. Upon her return home, after observing a number of design faults, Avengers captain drew up recommendations for future escort carrier design. In November 1942 she took part in Operation Torch, the Allied invasion of North Africa, where she suffered engine problems. While leaving North Africa to start the journey home Avenger was sunk by the on 15 November 1942 at 3:20am GMT, 9 hours after leaving Gibraltar for Britain, with a heavy loss of life among her crew. Design and description The s were converted American type C3 merchant ships of the C3 class. Their design was based on the U.S. Navy (AVG1). To differentiate between the two classes, the Royal Navy ships were prefixed with a 'B' (BAVG). HMS Avenger (BAVG2) was built by the Sun Shipbuilding and Drydock Company in Chester, Pennsylvania, south of Philadelphia on the Delaware River. Originally named Rio-Hudson, she was laid down on 28 November 1939 as a passenger cargo ship for the American Moore- McCormack Lines, Inc., and was launched on 27 November 1940. She was then purchased by the United States Navy and converted to an escort aircraft carrier in the Bethlehem Steel yards at Staten Island. Transferred to the Royal Navy on 31 July 1941, she was commissioned 2 March 1942 when the conversion was completed.Cocker (2008), p.78.Poolman (1972), p.38. Avenger had a complement of 555 men (including aircrew) and an overall length of , a beam of , and a height of . She displaced at normal load and at deep load. Propulsion was provided by four diesel engines connected to one shaft, giving 8,500 brake horsepower. This could propel the ship at .Cocker (2008), p.79. Aircraft facilities were composed of a small combined bridge-flight control on the starboard side above the long wooden flight deck, one aircraft lift, one aircraft catapult, and nine arrestor wires. Aircraft could be housed in the half hangar below the flight deck.Poolman (1972), p.29. Her armament consisted of three single-mounted 4 inch dual purpose anti-aircraft guns‚Äîtwo forward and one aft‚Äîand fifteen 20 mm cannon on single or twin mounts. She had the capacity for fifteen aircraft, which could be a mixture of Grumman Martlet or Hawker Sea Hurricane fighter aircraft and Fairey Swordfish anti-submarine aircraft. Service history Sea Hurricane of 802 Naval Air Squadron. On 18 April 1942, Avenger started flight deck landing training with four Fairey Swordfish aircraft of 816 Naval Air Squadron, Fleet Air Arm. The exercise had to be curtailed when her engines broke down. Repaired by 30 April 1942, she joined the escort for convoy AT 17 to cross the Atlantic to Britain. During the crossing the Swordfish of 816 Squadron provided anti-submarine patrols. On 4 May, two aircraft lost the convoy in heavy weather and requested a homing beacon from Avenger. She was unable to help, not having the correct equipment, and both aircraft and crews were reported missing. When Avenger arrived in Britain the Fleet Air Arm had a shortage of Martlet fighter aircraft, so a small number of Royal Air Force Hawker Hurricanes were converted into Sea Hurricanes. Avenger was chosen to test their deck landing ability on escort carriers. The tests, flown by Eric \\"Winkle\\" Brown,Wings on my Sleeve p. 46 were successful, and the Sea Hurricane equipped 802 Naval Air Squadron and 882 Naval Air Squadron, with 12 aircraft assigned to Avenger. They were joined by three Fairey Swordfish and five crews from 825 Naval Air Squadron.Poolman (1972), p.41. =Convoy PQ 18= Fleet Air Arm Sea Hurricanes in formation On 3 September 1942, Avenger, under the command of ex-Swordfish pilot Commander Anthony Paul Colthust, left Britain for Iceland to take part in Convoy PQ 18. The weather was cold, and in heavy seas one of her Sea Hurricanes broke its restraints and was lost over the side. The ship was located at sea by a Luftwaffe Focke-Wulf Condor, and shortly after arriving in Iceland, Avenger was subjected to a bombing attack by another Condor. Both of the bombs it dropped missed the ship, but two houses ashore were demolished. In their determination for PQ 18 to be a success, the Royal Navy created the largest escort force ever assembled for an Arctic convoy up until that time. Under command of Rear-Admiral Robert Burnett, the force included Avenger‚Äîthe only aircraft carrier‚Äîwhich was joined by the anti-aircraft cruiser and 16 fleet destroyers, plus the normal complement of close support sloops, corvettes, and minelayers. Avenger and Scylla, with the close escort destroyers and , left Iceland and joined the convoy late on 9 September 1942. One of her Swordfish aircraft was immediately sent up on an anti-submarine patrol. Bad weather prevented any flying for the following two days, but the weather cleared by noon on 12 September. The clearer skies revealed a Blohm & Voss BV 138 flying boat shadowing the convoy. Four Hurricanes took off to intercept it but could not find it in the clouds. Later the same day, a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol sighted two U-boats; they had dived by the time the escorts got into position.Poolman (1972), pp.42‚Äì43. The next day, 13 September, a Swordfish took off on patrol at 03:45 and attacked a U-boat on the surface. At 07:00, another Swordfish sighted two U-boats, which dived before an attack could be launched. Later another Blohm & Voss BV 138 was sighted and Sea Hurricanes were sent to intercept it, but it was lost in the clouds. At 09:00 two merchant ships were torpedoed and sunk; more aircraft and U-boats were located shadowing the convoy. This time the Sea Hurricanes did locate the German reconnaissance aircraft but found their .303 calibre machine guns had little effect on the armoured Blohm & Voss aircraft. At 15:00 six Junkers Ju 88 which had been circling the convoy headed in on a bombing attack. No ships were hit, and the Sea Hurricanes started to engage them. The bombing mission appears to have been a diversion to get the fighters out of position. It was followed with a torpedo attack by a mixed formation of 50 Junkers Ju 88 and Heinkel He 111.Poolman (1972), p.43. The planes flew into an intense anti-aircraft barrage which shot down five aircraft and disrupted the others, so that out of 96 torpedoes only eight found a target. One of the He 111s was also intercepted and shot down by the Sea Hurricanes. Another air attack by nine Heinkel He 115 torpedo bombers followed at 16:15. One was shot down by the convoy's anti-aircraft barrage, and the rest were sufficiently deterred so that their torpedoes, dropped at a distance, were easily evaded by the ships in the convoy. During this attack the Sea Hurricanes had again been diverted to look for a shadowing Blohm & Voss BV 138, which ultimately shot one of them down without any apparent damage to itself. At 20:40 a force of 12 He 111 torpedo-bombers attacked in small groups, but almost half were shot down by the anti-aircraft barrage and the Sea Hurricanes, which were in position to intercept them this time.Poolman (1972), p.44. Convoy PQ 18 an underwater detonation erupts next to At 03:30 on 14 September, a U-boat torpedoed and sank a tanker at the rear of the convoy. A patrolling Swordfish attacked at 04:00 and forced a surfaced U-boat to dive, although the submarine did not appear to be damaged. Another Swordfish sighted at 09:40; this submarine also dived, but was located and sunk by . Avengers captain now had to change tactics to work around a limitation of the Sea Hurricanes and Fairey Swordfish: They were not able to use the USN designed catapult which required a tail down take off, rather than the tail up method used by the Royal Navy's catapults, and so needed the full deck length to take off. He endeavoured to keep a section of fighter aircraft in the air during daylight hours and another ready to launch, so they could break up large German aircraft formations. This entailed a continuous cycle of take offs and landings to re- fuel and re-arm. At 12:30 a group of 22 Ju 88s and He 111s with an escort of Messerschmitt Bf 110s approached the convoy from dead ahead. Aboard Avenger, nine Sea Hurricanes took off. Their presence forced some of the German planes to drop their torpedoes early and turn away, while others were shot down by the anti-aircraft barrage. A simultaneous attack by a force of 14 Ju 88s at the rear of the convoy divided the Sea Hurricane squadrons, which shot down one of the Ju 88s. The carrier and escorts were targeted by the German aircraft, and about 20 aircraft succeeded in making a bombing run. One aircraft was shot down by the barrage, the eleventh of the day.Poolman (1972), pp.45‚Äì46. Immediately following, at 15:30, 25 He 111 torpedo bombers appeared in front of the convoy. Of these, 17 targeted Avenger, which managed to evade all the torpedoes. However, three of her Sea Hurricanes, which had closed on the He 111s, were shot down by the escorts' barrage. The pilots were all rescued. Another force of Ju 88s appeared and targeted Avenger and Scylla. Neither ship was hit, but a number of near misses were recorded. One near miss started a small fire in Avengers catapult room, which was quickly dealt with. That was the last attack of the day. The Sea Hurricanes claimed five out of 24 aircraft shot down; another three were probably shot down; and 14 were damaged.Poolman (1972), pp.46‚Äì47 A merchant ship exploding, photographed from the flight deck of HMS Avenger During the early hours of 15 September, the convoy was fogbound. The fog started to clear at 12:20, and Avengers radar operator reported a group of 70 bombers approaching. All of Avengers remaining Sea Hurricanes took off to intercept them. The presence of the fighters kept the bombers above the cloud level; their altitude kept them from bombing with any accuracy. The bombers remained in the vicinity of the convoy until fuel shortages forced them to leave, and by 16:45 Avengers radar was clear of any targets.Poolman (1972), p.47. On 16 September a Consolidated Catalina of No. 210 Squadron RAF, based in Russia, arrived to take over the anti-submarine patrols from Avengers Swordfish. This allowed her to clear the deck of Swordfish and assemble the spare Sea Hurricanes for the return journey. Avenger, Scylla, and the destroyers left PQ 18 that evening to join the homeward bound convoy leaving Russian waters. When Convoy PQ 18 arrived at Archangel no escorts and only ten of the 41 merchant ships in the convoy had been sunk.Poolman (1972), p.48. =Convoy QP 14= Fairey Swordfish taking off from an escort carrier Avenger and the escorts joined the homeward bound Convoy QP 14 at 05:00 17 September and sent up a Swordfish on anti-submarine patrol, which was maintained throughout the day. Ice on the flight deck prevented any flying on 18 September, and the convoy turned further north, away from the German airfields in Norway. A German reconnaissance plane did locate the convoy, but only kept it under observation and did not attack, so the Sea Hurricanes were kept on board Avenger. The Swordfish remained on patrol on 19 and 20 September without locating any U-boats. One merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk on 20 September. At 18:45 that evening, with three destroyers as escorts, Avenger left the convoy for Scapa Flow. Almost as soon as she was out of sight, was torpedoed, and two days later a merchant ship was torpedoed and sunk. After returning to port, Avengers captain Commander Colthust submitted a report highlighting how inadequate the Swordfish and Sea Hurricanes had been. In a single escort carrier the number of airframes and crews were never enough for what they had been asked to do. The Swordfish could not take off from the short flight deck of an escort carrier deck armed with torpedoes or enough depth charges and fuel to be useful, and the .303 calibre machine guns on the Sea Hurricane were ineffective against the armoured German reconnaissance aircraft.Poolman (1972), p.49. =Operation Torch= and Avenger seen from the deck of , which has two Supermarine Seafires on board HMS Avenger, , and left Scapa for Greenock on 16 October 1942. Avenger still had the two Sea Hurricane squadrons on board, with two new aircraft armed with 20 mm cannon. Avenger was tasked with providing air cover for one of the convoys carrying the British assault force for Operation Torch.Poolman (1972), p.55. Once off North Africa she would join the covering force for the landings, with , three cruisers, and five destroyers. On arrival on 8 November 1942, the Supermarine Seafires from Argus and Avengers Sea Hurricanes provided air cover for the landings. Between 8‚Äì10 November Avenger flew 60 fighter missions. On 9 November, she had a near miss by a torpedo from a He 111, and from 10‚Äì12 November she was laid up with engine problems before sailing for Gibraltar. HMS Avenger was torpedoed and sunk with a heavy loss of life (516 perished) by under the command of Kapit√§nleutnant Adolf Piening on 15 November 1942, just west of Gibraltar. Struck by only one torpedo, she quickly sank. Only twelve members of her crew were rescued.Syrett (1994), p.17.

The gameplay is heavily based on Super Mario Kart, released for the Super NES three years prior. Players select from one of 8 possible characters, each driving unique vehicles.  Gameplay  XTreme Racing can be played by up to four players on one computer, or with up to 8 players via a null modem connection. = Single player = There are three Single Player modes available at the start of the game. The first is a Cup Mode, wherein the player can compete in one of 4 cups (2 more were added in the upgrade pack, bringing the total to 6). The cups usually contain 5 tracks of varying difficulty. The better position you attain each race, the more points you acquire. The second is a Tournament Mode, in which players must not only strive to make it into at least first, second or third position each race, but in which you can also obtain money with which you can buy upgrades for your chosen car. The third mode is a standard Time Trial Mode, the aim of which being to attain as fast a time as possible on your selected tracks without the distraction of other vehicles (the other two modes also log Lap Records). Perhaps the most annoying fascet of this mode, Lap Records are not automatically saved but rather must be saved by selecting the \\"Save Records\\" option on the Frontend Menu. = Multiplayer = As well as the Cup and Tournament Modes listed above, Multiplayer also includes a Versus Mode, wherein the players (and as many computer-controlled players as you wish, if any) race head-to-head on the tracks of your choosing. The game also includes a Battle Mode similar to that in Super Mario Kart although actually more inspired by another Super NES game, Street Racer.  Reception  With critical acclaim in Amiga gaming magazines, the game itself sold well on AGA machines, however not enough to justify a full sequel. This was due to the state of the Amiga market at the time (by comparison, Worms: The Directors Cut, a fairly high-profile release also with input from the programming team at Silltunna Software, only sold 5,000 when it was released in 1997. Legacy In 1996 an upgrade pack, including additional tracks, bug fixes, new features and additional Cups to participate in, was made available to people who registered their copy of the game with the publisher. The upgrade pack also included a Map Editor, which a few people have used to produce brand new maps over the years. The upgrade pack, as well as many user-made maps, are now available on Aminet. Xtreme Racing appeared as an almost full version on a magazine coverdisk, missing only some of the map graphics which were then made available for download on the Aminet.

In the early 20th century they lived in huts in the forests and cultivated. Starting from the 1970s and continuing today, many of the Jenu Kurubas have been evicted from their homes due to conservation measures in the various tiger reserves of the Nilgiris, like Nagarhole and Bandipur. Those who have been relocated outside the forest are daily wagers and agricultural labourers, who live in extreme poverty. Many work as labourers on coffee estates in Kodagu or for the Forest Department. They speak the Jenu Kurumba language, either classified as being related to Kodava or a rural dialect of Kannada. The tribals have fought multiple times to live in the reserved forests, most recently in 2020, under the terms of the Forest Rights Act. Previously their women wore a sari in the style of typical Mysore rural women, and if poor, wore a cloth around the waist and another to partially cover the upper body.

With men recruited in Oregon and some recruited in surrounding states, the regiment primarily served to protect the state of Oregon and surrounding territories during the American Civil War. Background In 1861, Colonel George Wright requested permission from Oregon Governor John Whiteaker to form a cavalry company in the state, as Wright was commander of the District of Oregon that included the Washington Territory.Corning, Howard M. (1989) Dictionary of Oregon History. Binfords & Mort Publishing. p. 84. Wright was motivated by the fact that there were a total of 700 soldiers and 19 officers in the Pacific Northwest at a time when there were often battles with Native Americans. Some volunteers joined up, asked to provide their own horse, but were later discharged when the organization failed before Wright was transferred to California. Lieutenant Colonel Albemarle Cady replaced Wright late in 1861 as United States Army regular troops were returned east for the American Civil War. To replace those troops, Wright sent volunteers from California to protect Oregon from attacks by Native Americans. In response, Oregon then commissioned Thomas R. Cornelius in November 1861 as colonel and ordered him to raise ten companies of cavalry troops. Oregonians were unhappy with California volunteers protecting Oregon. Formation The initial part of the regiment (companies A through F) was organized and mustered into the army in Oregon from December 1861 to April 1862. In May 1862, it was sent into the Washington Territory to the Walla Walla country to protect immigrants and miners along the Salmon River. The 1st Oregon occupied Fort Walla Walla in June 1862 and sent out various expeditions over the next two years to fight the Snake Indians and other threats. Hence, the regiment was rarely intact as a single unit for much of the war. Several companies scattered to other frontier forts, including Fort Vancouver and Fort Dalles (see also The Dalles, Oregon) for detached duty such as constructing roads through the wilderness. In January 1863, the remaining portion of the regiment (companies G, H, I, K, and M) were authorized and activated for duty. Companies G and H served at Camp Watson on Rock Creek; Company I was at Fort Klamath, Company K at Fort Dalles and Companies L and M at Fort Boise in Idaho Territory. The battalion came together for several skirmishes with local Indians in the Harney Lake Valley and other locations. Men signed up for a three-year tour of duty with the cavalry. Pay was $31 per month for each soldier, and at the end of service men were given a $100 bounty and of land. In addition to Col. Cornelius, other officers included R. F. Maury, C. S. Drew, Benjamin F. Harding as quartermaster, and J. S. Rinearson. Disbanding In January 1865, Col. Reuben F. Maury, 1st Oregon Cavalry, assumed command of the Federal District of Oregon. The 1st Oregon Cavalry mustered out November 20, 1866. The 1st Oregon Volunteer Cavalry Regiment did not muster out all at once, but did so in stages beginning in November 1864. Two years later there were only a small number of men remaining to muster out of service. 1st Regiment Oregon Volunteer Cavalry Commanders * Colonel Thomas R. Cornelius 1862 * Colonel Reuben F.

The NVSHL staff and board of directors includes a combination of coaches, parents, team representatives, referee, and rink supervisors. There are also many members who are not affiliated with and particular team or organization. The current league executive director is Grey Bullen, and its assistant executive director is Jeff Nygaard. Bullen joined the league after Bud Sterling served the same capacity for the previous two seasons. Prior to that, the league was headed by Nygaard, who brought the league from being a part of the MSHL to its own entity, the NVSHL. Teams play a ten-game regular season, followed by a multi-round single elimination playoff tournament to determine the league champion. In the end, the league winner will have played either 13 or 14 games, depending on whether they received a bye in the first round. History The NVSHL was created in response to a growing number of varsity-level teams in Northern Virginia. Until the inaugural 2001-02 season, teams from Northern Virginia competed in the similar Maryland Scholastic Hockey League. The inaugural season consisted of two conferences of 12 varsity and provisional varsity (Tier-I) teams each, as well as a junior varsity (Tier-II) league. Since that season, the league has expanded to include 22 varsity, five provisional varsity, and nine junior varsity teams in the 2005-06 season. The 2005-2006 season saw the change of Tier-II to Junior Varsity to more closely reflect the standard of traditional high school sports. Additionally, the league attempts to structure the divisions within the Varsity classification to closely reflect the \\"Districts\\" used by the Virginia High School League. NVSHL teams are not officially recognized as varsity school sports by the Commonwealth of Virginia. Only one team, Osbourn High School, has been officially recognized by its local school board, Manassas City Public Schools. In 2012, the NVSHL introduced the middle school division to provide younger players with an opportunity to play in the NVSHL. Teams Teams are divided into three levels: varsity, provisional varsity, and junior varsity. Varsity teams are further divided into five divisions. Four of these divisions include only varsity teams composed of players from a single school, and are divided by geographical area. These divisions are the Concorde (North) Division, Liberty (East) Division, Cardinal (South) Division, and the Dulles (West) Division. In addition, the fifth division is reserved for all provisional varsity teams (those consisting of players from more than one school). The provisional division includes teams from all geographical areas. Provisional teams may not qualify for season-ending playoffs, but do compete in regular season games versus other varsity teams. The games count toward each team's record equally with that of a game played between two varsity teams or two provisional teams. This is a matter of controversy, however, because a talented provisional team may spoil a varsity team's chance to qualify for the league playoffs by defeating them or putting the varsity team at a statistical disadvantage for the purposes of tiebreakers. Junior varsity teams play in the junior varsity division, and do not compete in regular games versus varsity or provisional varsity teams. There is no distinction between junior varsity teams composed of players from single or multiple schools. There currently aren't playoffs for junior varsity teams. The last time playoffs were held came in 2003-04, when Forest Park defeated Paul VI. The champion is determined by season record. In years past, there have been playoffs for the junior varsity division. This division was formerly known as the Nygaard Division, named after the first executive director of the NVSHL.

It is situated close to Parliament House, which formerly housed the Parliament of Scotland and is now the home of the Court of Session. Together with brass markers bearing building dates, it records the position of the 15th-century Old Tolbooth, demolished in 1817, which was the administrative centre of the town, a prison, and one of several sites of public execution. The mosaic is named after the historical county of Midlothian of which Edinburgh was the county town. This is not to be confused with the council area of the same name which covers a smaller area and does not include the capital. Spitting Visitors to Edinburgh will often notice people spitting on the Heart. Although it is now said to be done for good luck, it was originally done as a sign of disdain for the former prison of which the entrance lay directly at the Heart's locationMonuments and Statues of Edinburgh, Michael T.R.B.

It is the central historical point of the Hollywood District. The Theatre is located at 4122 NE Sandy Blvd, across the street from the first suburban Fred Meyer store, which is currently occupied by Rite Aid. The Hollywood Theatre was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983 and is considered to be a gem of Northeast Portland's historic culture and tradition. Commissioned by Jensen and Herberg, architects John Virginius Bennes and Harry A. Herzog designed the building in multiple styles including Spanish Colonial (exterior) and after the Baths of Caracalla and Bernini (interior). The theater opened on Saturday, July 17th 1926, with 1,491 seats, as a venue for vaudeville and silent movies. It became a Cinerama theater in 1961, utilizing the ultra-widescreen process until 1963. It was still labelled a \\"Cinerama theater\\" until 1969, running exclusively 70mm films. On June 13th 1968, Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey opened, and ran for over 10 months. In 1975, the theater was divided into three auditoriums, and ran second run films throughout the '80s and '90s. The theater became a non-profit in 1997. Starting in 2011, major renovations were done, including new seats, screens, sound systems and an updated paint job. In 2013, a Kickstarter campaign raised the funds necessary to erect a new marquee, and in 2015, 70mm capability was re-installed. The Hollywood Theatre currently screens first run films; along with a wide range of both well known and obscure classic cinema, offbeat exploitation, educational, independent and experimental films; with a focus of screening repertory films on 35mm and 70mm. The theater also has hosted many special guests since 2015, including Quentin Tarantino, Pam Grier, Michael Ironside, Piper Laurie and Joe Dante. The main auditorium has a 50-foot screen and 384 seats, while two smaller auditoriums are located upstairs, each seating 111. The theater is self-owned and operated by a non-profit organization of the same name. Its mission is to preserve and maintain the historic theater and use it to present a diverse program of films. Airport theater In December 2015, Hollywood Theatre announced plans to open an annex theater in Portland International Airport. The theater will seat 18 with standing room for 10 to 20 people and also have space for live performances. The theatre will show short films no longer than 20 minutes and be free of charge. In mid-February 2017, it was reported that the airport \\"microcinema\\" would open on February 23 and have seating for 17 people. Movie Madness In 2017, the Hollywood Theatre purchased the iconic Portland video store Movie Madness, and its collection of over 90,000 movies.

Besides books, DVDs, CDs, music, and educational CD-ROMs from The Teaching Company, it offers a wide range of services including lectures, art exhibits, cultural readings, movies, special events, programs for teenagers, and Internet access. It is a short walk from the library to the train station and to Summit's downtown area. History In 1891, Summit's first library opened, but it was \\"neither public nor free,\\" according to one account. That building later became the Summit Playhouse. In 1911, the first free public library opened on Maple Street on land donated by the Bonnel family's Summit Home Land Company. Funds from the estate of Andrew Carnegie helped build the library during the years of 1900 to 1917, and the Summit Public Library is listed among the 36 Carnegie libraries of New Jersey. In 1964, the library was replaced by a newer building next door. In 1996, there was a capital campaign to raise funds for the library; $1.3 million was raised, in part with a community production of \\"The Music Man\\". Construction began in October 1997. Users could still have access to books by walking inside temporary trailers during the expansion. The expanded and renovated building reopened in March 1999. There is a parking lot available between the library and the Summit YMCA; in addition, there are on- street metered parking spots available, some with a 15-minute limit to facilitate availability. In 2003, a young library staff member named Sherrie Murphy who had two young children died of cancer; in 2007, the library dedicated a statue entitled \\"The Joy of Reading\\" by sculptor Robert Hill in her memory, who made the sculpture without payment; the statue is outdoors on the eastern side of the building. Special programs The library hosts week- long arts workshops and craft programs. The library also features prominent local artists and photographers. The library allows users to download audiobooks. Users can renew materials online. The library has a special weekday afterschool program for teens called CATSS, an acronym for Cool Awesome Teen Students of Summit, which involves mentoring, projects, book reading activities, and games, and which meets on selected afternoons. Sometimes lectures are held at the library. The library sometimes contributes boxes of books for charitable purposes. During summer months, the library sometimes sponsors film festivals in which award-winning foreign films are shown. Administration Susan Permahos was appointed Library Director in 2013 assuming the position from Glenn Devitt who held the position for more than 20 years. Other administrators include Abigail Brady, Head of Adult Services, Ann-Marie Aymer, Head of Youth Services, Beata Barrasso, Head of Technical Services/System Administrator and Diane Hull, Head of Circulation. Library trustees in recent years have included Arthur T. Vanderbilt II, Ruth H. Hamann, Eleanor K.Haugh, John B. Crosby, Jr., Jon Plaut, Sandy Bloom, Christina Amundson, James G. Fleischmann, Susan Callahan and Diane Klaif. Trustee meetings are usually held on the second Wednesday of each month except during the summer. Policies All Summit adult residents can have full- service library cards if they provide current proof of residence; cards are valid for three years. The library extends permission to various others such as non-resident students, employees who work in Summit, au pairs, and residents of neighboring towns on a reciprocal basis. The library offers free Internet access; filtering software has been installed on the terminals in the juvenile room. The library permits donations and gifts, although is unable to accept books in poor physical condition, textbooks, magazines, condensed book, encyclopedias, and encourages donations of bestsellers, new novels (published in the current year), up-to-date nonfiction books, recently published paperback novels, and current children's and young adult books. The library can't provide appraisals of the value of donated materials for tax purposes. Donors are encouraged to call first before bringing in books and tangible items. In addition, library policy states that members must not take pictures within the library without prior written permission from the director.

The land was later assigned to his widow by U.S. President Andrew Johnson in 1866. 1890s-era maps refer to the area as the Crook Tract. In the 20th century, the now-defunct Rodgers store chain had its headquarters (as well as its largest store) in the Hollywood District from 1955 to 1984.

Situated on the Stockton University campus, the Mainland Campus experienced a 44% growth in admissions from 1986 to 1992. The Mainland Campus completed a $16 million modernization or renovation project in early 1992. History What was once called Atlantic City Hospital in the late 19th century and early 20th century, and became Atlantic City Medical Center, and is now AtlantiCare Regional Medical Center has a history that is deeply tied to the roots of Atlantic City, New Jersey. =Early years= It wasn't until the late 1880s that community leaders took steps to provide basic medical care for Atlantic City residents and visitors. They designated a room in the old City Hall for medical emergencies and set up another building outside city limits to treat contagious diseases. This arrangement seemed to work for a while, especially since a private sanitarium‚Äîwhich could house additional patients‚Äîwas built a few years later. However the sanitarium did not admit anyone with an infectious disease. Then, in 1895 and 1896, two disastrous incidents occurred that made people think about the adequacy of medical care in Atlantic City. First, a building collapsed during a crowded Elks convention, injuring too many people to be cared for at City Hall. The following year, a major railroad accident resulted in 100 patients, all of whom had to be cared for at the sanitarium. What would happen the next time there was an accident or health crisis? The proprietor of the sanitarium was considering ending his contract with the city. The time had come for Atlantic City to have a hospital. =Creation of hospital= At first it seemed that constructing a hospital in Atlantic City would be difficult. Only two people, John P. Rochford, founder of the sanitarium, and Alfred W. Heston, city comptroller, attended the initial meeting on February 17, 1897. Rochford and Heston immediately elected each other temporary president and secretary, respectively, and named a board of nine other members. After several meetings of the full board, the Atlantic City Hospital Association was incorporated on April 8, 1897. Their first step was to find a location for the hospital. The Association chose a converted white house on Ohio Ave. and realized $16,000 to purchase it. The newly formed Ladies Auxiliary collected another $616 in donations, used for furnishings. The Association hired one full-time doctor, Alan Simpson, M.D., of Jefferson Medical College. They also obtained donations of sheets, reading material, canned goods and other necessities. In November 1898, the Atlantic City Hospital officially opened its doors. Its first patient was 11-year-old Gussie Johan, who suffered a broken leg from fall off of a carriage when a goat spooked his horse. The equipment was scant: a dozen chairs, a few tables, some hospital machines and a dilapidated horse-drawn ambulance.

The hospital was named for Nathan Barnert, a philanthropist and former mayor of Paterson who founded the hospital. In 1914, Barnert donated a site at East 30th Street and Broadway and provided an endowment. The original building was designed by Fred Wesley Wentworth in the classical revival style, constructed of a pink granite base and yellow brick with extensive detailing and other elaborate materials. it stood until the mid 1960s when it was demolished for a more modern structure. The hospital was a full-service facility offering perinatal care, family care services and an outpatient infusion unit treating high risk pregnancies and hematology-oncology patients. Its operations were drastically scaled back in its last years of operation due to serious financial difficulties. The hospital sought Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection in August, 2007. The hospital initially intended to close on September 28, 2007 due to a lack of funds. However soon after the announcement both the State and Federal governments appropriated $3.5 million to keep the hospital open while a buyer was sought. Several groups attempted unsuccessfully to raise $3.5 million in order to purchase the facility and convert it into a multi-use specialty hospital. The bankruptcy court reviewed bids, however these plans did not materialize and the hospital announced its closure on February 1, 2008.\\"Paterson's Barnert Hospital to Close its Doors\\" , WINS (AM), February 2, 2008. Accessed July 11, 2008. The hospital closed officially on May 30, 2008. Following Barnert's bankruptcy, the facility was purchased by Community Healthcare Associates and reorganized as a 'medical arts complex.' As of September 17, 2009, Barnert is at over 90% capacity with tenants that include pharmacists, hospice care, an adult day-care center, a sub-acute rehabilitation center and group practices that provide primary care.

He can play in any position across the back four and has played four games for the Danish national team. He is the older brother of Jacob Albrechtsen. Career =Akademisk Boldklub (AB)= Born in V√¶rl√∏se in the Capital Region of Denmark, Albrechtsen started his career at Akademisk Boldklub (AB). Alongside later Danish international Peter L√∏venkrands, he was called up for the Danish under-19 national team in September 1997. In February 1998 they both signed their first professional contracts with AB, joining the senior squad which competed in the Danish Superliga championship. In the 1998-99 season, he scored 1 league goal in 9 games for tAB, while the following season he scores one goal in 31 league games. Albrechtsen was a part of the AB team which won the 1999 Danish Cup, and he was named 2000 Danish under-21 Talent of the Year. He made his debut for the Denmark national football team under national team manager Morten Olsen in April 2001. As AB struggled financially, Albrechtsen was sold to defending Superliga champions F.C. Copenhagen (FCK) in a DKK 9 million transfer deal in January 2002. =F.C. Copenhagen= Albrechtsen signed a 4¬Ω-year contract with Copenhagen, looking to replace former team captain Jacob Laursen in the central defence. In total he played 14 league games for L√∏verne in the latter part of the 2001-02-season, while he made 27 league matches in 2002-03. He helped the club.win the 2003 and 2004 Danish Superliga championships, as well as the 2004 Danish Cup trophy. His performances for the club led to two additional national team matches, but after an unimpressive effort during the 0‚Äì2 loss to Bosnia and Herzegovina in April 2003, his national team career went on a hiatus. He made his debut for the club on 3 March 2002 when they played 0‚Äì0 against AGF. Albrechtsen made his first European appearance for Copenhagen on 27 November 2003 when they drew 1‚Äì1 at Mallorca in a match in the UEFA Cup. =West Bromwich Albion= In June 2004, he moved abroad to play for English club West Bromwich Albion in the FA Premier League. He was bought in a ¬£2.5 million transfer deal, making him the most expensive player the club had ever bought at that point. He made his debut for the club on 28 August 2004, coming on as a substitute in a Premiership match against Everton. Albrechtsen was a regular for Albion during 2004‚Äì05, helping them to avoid relegation on the final day of the season. He also figured prominently during the following season, and scored his first ever goal for the club in the 1‚Äì0 win against Wigan Athletic at the JJB Stadium in January 2006. He stayed with the club as Albion were relegated to the secondary English Football League in the summer 2006, and he scored his second goal for the club against Leeds United in September 2006. After an absence of more than three years, he was recalled for the Danish national team in November 2006. Despite being signed as a central-defender, Albrechtsen had, prior to the 2007‚Äì08 season, been utilised mainly as a full-back. In August 2007 however, Albion manager Tony Mowbray decided to move the Danish player back into the centre of defence. Albrechtsen made his 100th appearance for Albion in the 1‚Äì0 defeat at Sheffield United on 25 August 2007. =Derby County= After failing to agree terms with West Brom on a new deal, Albrechsten joined Derby County on a Bosman free transfer, signing a two-year contract with the club on 30 June 2008. In the process he became manager Paul Jewell's eighth signing of the season. Albrechtsen made his debut for Derby in a 1‚Äì0 home defeat to Doncaster Rovers on the opening day of the 2008‚Äì09 season, and in September scored his first goal for the club, against Cardiff City and netted his second in the next match, a 2‚Äì0 win at Q.P.R.. Albrechtsen's fine start to his Derby career saw him nominated for the September Championship Player of the Month award, though he lost out to Reading's Kevin Doyle., BBCSport, accessed 15 October 2008 The following month he underwent a hernia operation and kept him away from first team action for around a month. On his return from injury, he slotted back into the defence and on 18 February he played in his 300th career league game against Blackpool at Pride Park. He quickly fell out of favour with new manager Nigel Clough, however, and his contract at the club was cancelled by mutual consent on 30 August 2009. After a few days joining FC Midtjylland, Albrechtsen revealed the motives behind his decision to part ways with Derby County. He claimed to have been annoyed at being handed a number of fines by Clough for breaches of club rules like doing interviews without permission. =FC Midtjylland= After being released from Derby County, FC Midtjylland announced the club have signed FC Midtjylland on a free transfer and returned to Denmark after spending 5 years in England. Following his move, Albrechtsen was given a number 5 shirt. Albrechtsen made his debut in a FC Midtjylland shirt against FC Nordsj√¶lland on 12 September 2009 in a 2‚Äì0 loss.

The regiment was recruited from the northern line of Maryland counties, under the call of July 1, 1862, for \\"three years or the war. Toward the end of August, 1862, nine companies had been enrolled and mustered in Baltimore, and went into \\" Camp Harford,\\" a spot now included within the limits of Druid Hill Park. The aggregate strength of the regiment at formation was 784 officers and men. Call of duty hurried it to the field before it had received its tenth company, the men recruited for which were mustered into other regiments. The tenth Company, K , was composed of the re- enlisted men of the Tenth Maryland (a six months' organization), and joined the regiment in April, 1864. The Seventh Regiment was raised and originally commanded by Colonel Edwin H. Webster, of Harford County, a representative from Maryland in Congress. Lieut.-Colonel Charles E. Phelps, subsequently promoted Colonel, and later Brigadier-General by brevet, was a member of the Baltimore bar, and had been Major of the \\"Maryland Guard,\\" somewhat celebrated just before the war as a thoroughly drilled volunteer battalion. Additional leadership was provided by Major William H. Dallam, a prominent and highly esteemed lawyer of Harford County. Dallam had served as the Clerk of the Circuit Court and for many years as State's Attorney. After serving guard duty in the defenses of Washington, the regiment was sent to the Shenandoah Valley for operations. Their first combat came on March 13, 1863, when they repulsed a charge by the 5th Virginia Infantry regiment. They were sent to V Corps, Army of the Potomac. At the Battle of Gettysburg, they were forced to withdraw from the Peach Orchard early on the second day. They were among the units who repelled Pickett's charge. Th unit was stationed for garrison duty in southern Pennsylvania and was involved in skirmishes against some of Jubal Early's infantry units. Because of heavy losses at the Battle of Cold Harbor, they were sent as replacements to IV corps, Army of the Potomac. They suffered heavy casualties during the Siege of Petersburg, having to repel six charges by counterattacking units of the 15th Georgia Volunteer Infantry. They marched in the Grand review and were mustered out of service on June 3, 1865. This unit suffered the loss of 389 men, who were 23 officers and 366 enlisted men, and 65 of those men died of disease. 13 men were captured at Gettysburg, 5 of which perished at Libby Prison.

He later immigrated to the United States. During his competitive years he stood 5‚Ä≤ 11¬Ω‚Ä≥ (1.82 m) tall and weighed 247 lb (112 kg), and was part of a group of large and dominant throwers referred to as the Irish Whales. He did not achieve success in the hammer throw until age 27, when he ranked seventh on the world list of best marks. He remained in the world's top ten up to the age of 50, making his career one of the longest and most consistent in the history of the sport. He won seven AAU hammer throw championships, won seven more in the little- contested 56-pound weight throw, and set two hammer throw world records. His lifetime best throw was the second of those records, 187‚Ä≤ 4‚Ä≥ (57.10 m), made at New York City‚Äôs Celtic Park on October 29, 1911. McGrath made his Olympic debut in 1908. He entered the Olympics as the (unofficial) world record holder and took second behind John Flanagan's third consecutive victory. In 1912 McGrath won the Olympic title in dominating fashion (the shortest of his six throws was over 15 feet (4.5 m) longer than any other competitor's best throw) and set an Olympic record that stood for 24 years.

The assault was led by Brazilian general Augusto Heleno and was carried out by COMANF on July 6, 2005. Cit√© Soleil, the location where the assault occurred, was largely governed by Aristide-backed gangs affiliated with Fanmi Lavalas who monitored visitors via two roads that accessed the slum. Background In February 2004, under pressure from the United States government and local unrest, Prime Minister Claudette Werleigh resigned. Large portions of Cit√© Soleil, a slum largely without government services, water infrastructure, or police presence, were politically loyal to Aristide. The Fanmi Lavalas affiliated gangs, of which Wilmer was a leader, and the anti-Aristide paramilitary groups began to scale up violence in response to the government of the new interim Prime Minister Gerard Latortue. The territory of the anti- Aristide paramilitary groups was located in a section of Cit√© Soleil known as Boston, backed by a leader known as Labaniere. More than a political war, the gangs were also fighting over drugs, turf, and other illegal activities. Residents attempting to cross from one turf to another without prior gang approval were shot by sniper fire for fear of being informants. The only hospital in the area was shut down after a French diplomat visiting the hospital was caught in a gun fight against a Wilmer-allied gang and was rescued from the facility by Brazilian Marines Special Forces. A wikileaks source revealed that the business elite of Haiti, aligned with the new government, were privately arming police forces after the February 2004 transfer of power to protect their business interests in the country. Thomas Robenson, aka Labaniere, was formerly a member of the Aristide-Lavalas party, but joined the private forces in protecting commercial zones following the February transfer of power. On March 30, 2005 Labaniere was killed by a Wilmer-backed group. After Labaniere's death, UN troops had difficulty discerning Cit√© Soleil residents from government opposition members. On July 6, 2005, the UN assault began. Controversy The pro-Aristide Haitian Lawyers Leadership Network called Wilmer a community leader and a martyr. It is claimed by MINUSTAH and the supporters of the 2004 coup that Wilmer was a gangster; however, this characterization is disputed by supporters of deposed Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide and others. Local and left-leaning press characterized Wilmer as a freedom fighter defending his turf from foreign invaders. This press raised Wilmer to the same status of Charlemagne P√©ralte and Kapwa Lam√≤. On October 17, 2005, a few months after Wilmer's death, the people of Cit√© Soleil renamed a section of Route 9 as \\"Dread Wilme Boulevard\\".

James Monsignor Horan (5 May 1911 - 1 August 1986), born in Partry, County Mayo, Ireland, was a parish priest of Knock, County Mayo. He is most widely known for his successful campaign to bring an airport to Knock, his work on Knock Basilica, and is also credited for inviting Pope John Paul II to visit Knock Shrine in 1979. Ecclesiastical career Educated at St. Jarlath's College, Tuam, Monsignor Horan trained for the priesthood in St Patrick's College, Maynooth. He was ordained in 1936, and his first post was in Glasgow, where he remained for three years. Having served as chaplain on an ocean liner and briefly in Ballyglunin, County Galway, he became curate in Tooreen, a small townland close to Ballyhaunis, County Mayo. While there, he organised the construction of a dance hall, which became a popular local amenity. He secured finance for the project by collecting ¬£8,000 on a tour of American cities.The Good Samaritans - Memoir of a Biographer by Anthony J. Jordan. P. 113. Westport Books 2008, After also serving in Cloonfad, County Roscommon, he was transferred to Knock in 1963, where he became parish priest in 1967. Horan was troubled by the struggles of daily life and mass emigration in the west of Ireland and he worked to improve the living standards of the local community. Knock shrine While stationed at Knock, Monsignor Horan oversaw the building of a new church for Knock Shrine, which was dedicated in 1976. The shrine was the stated goal of Pope John Paul II's visit in 1979. The pope travelled to Knock as part of a state visit to Ireland, marking the centenary of the famous Knock apparitions. Horan worked with Judy Coyne to organise the papal visit. He was responsible for the refurbishment of the church grounds, along with the construction of a huge church, with a capacity of 15,000. This newly constructed church was given the status of basilica by the pope. The day after the papal visit, Horan began his campaign to build an international airport in Barnacuige, a small village near Charlestown, County Mayo. Knock airport Critics regarded the idea of an airport on a \\"foggy, boggy site\\" in Mayo as unrealistic, but funding was approved by then Taoiseach, Charles Haughey, who performed the official opening in May 1986, five years after work commenced. Although Horan had secured IR¬£10,000,000 in funding from Haughey, following the Fianna F√°il party's defeat in the general election of 1982, his funding was cut, with the airport unfinished. Horan raised the IR¬£4,000,000 shortfall by holding a \\"Jumbo Draw\\". This large lottery succeeded in raising the required revenue, but only after a painstaking tour of several countries, including Australia and the United States. This took its toll on the ageing Horan and led to his death shortly after the completion of the airport. The airport was originally known as Horan International Airport, but is now officially referred to as Ireland West Airport Knock. Death and legacy Monsignor Horan died while on a pilgrimage to Lourdes, just a few months after the official opening of the airport. His remains were flown into Knock, the first funeral to fly into the airport he had campaigned for. He was buried in the grounds of the Knock Basilica. His life and work were chronicled in a musical written by Terry Reilly and local broadcaster Tommy Marren, entitled A Wing and a Prayer. It premi√®red in The Royal Theatre in Castlebar, County Mayo, on 25 November 2010.

It was first developed in 1990 by Peter Scott, then at the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Canada. Using a client written by Earl Fogel, HyTelnet offered its users a primitive terminal-based GUI that allowed them to browse a directory of Telnet-based resources and then access them in a relatively standardized manner. On-line help was available, and there were frequent updates made available to its database which sites could download. HyTelnet's chief inadequacy was that it was not centralized, i.e., every HyTelnet installation used its own separate copy of the master directory. While beneficial early-on, as it ensured no dependence on a central server, HyTelnet's user experience could vary widely as local installations might not have the same version of the client or might have obsolete information. This became a greater liability as more institutions had reliable, \\"always-on\\" Internet access. Finally, when the World Wide Web gained pre-eminence, many of the services that HyTelnet pointed to were gradually retired, increasingly limiting its relevance. HyTelnet's final database update was in 1997. Interface This is a typical HyTelnet screen running much as a user would have experienced it, rendered in non-proportional font to simulate a terminal. This is from one of the last releases of the client, which was version 6.9.

Subject searches: To search for a particular subject, select S on the main menu. Keyword searches: Either \\"k\\" or \\"w\\" (varies from system to system) as listed on the menu. Other search options: Different INNOPAC libraries have added additional search options, such as Medical Subject Headings, Call Number, SuDocs numbers, Reserve Lists, etc. Popular options available when looking at any one record include: S > Show items with the SAME SUBJECT Z > Show items nearby on the shelf The regular updates not only updated the list of resources, but also the help files in addition. Modern implementations The HyTelnet client is no longer maintained, but there are several web-based re- creations available. * HYTELNET on the World Wide Web is the official implementation by default, as it is Peter Scott (the original author)'s own work at his Northern Lights Internet site. This is a simple reconstruction of the HyTelnet database, converted into flat HTML files suitable for any Web browser. There is also a simple search facility. * The Floodgap Hytelnet-HTTP Museum Gateway is a variation that attempts to mimic the look and feel of HyTelnet in a web browser, using non-proportional fonts and a similar navigational style (although now point-and-click because it is running in a browser). It enhances the experience slightly with JavaScript, although it offers versions for older browsers and an \\"ultra-classic\\" view to best simulate the old interface. It also has a simple search facility. Unlike the original HyTelnet, this implementation will attempt to verify remote hosts, and will also present possible Web-based alternatives to their databases.

He is best known as the leader of the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists between 1929 and 1938. Biography =Early Years= Konovalets was born June 14, 1891 in the village of Zashkiv in the Austro-Hungarian Galicia; today it is in Zhovkva Raion, Lviv Oblast, Ukraine. In his youth he studied in Lviv at the Lviv Academic Gymnasium Gymnasium principal: You can regret various canceled celebrations, but the priority of students' health is much more important, Ukrayinska Pravda (17 September 2020) and in 1909 enrolled in the University of Lviv, where he studied mathematics. In 1910 he participated in the protest to accommodate Ukrainians with their own university in Lviv. During this protest at least one person was killed. He became an active member of the Prosvita, the Ukrainian educational association, and a representative in the Executive Committee of the National- Democratic Party. He became the secretary of the Lviv department of the Prosvita organization in 1912. In 1913 he became one of the leaders of the local student movement. He was greatly influenced by the nationalist ideology and rhetoric of such prominent Ukrainians as Ivan Bobersky, Myroslav Sichynsky, Dmytro Dontsov, and others. =Military career= In the summer of 1914, Konovalets was mobilized into the Austro-Hungarian Army and during the First World War rose to the rank of a second lieutenant serving in the 19th Regiment of the Lviv Regional Defense. In 1915 he was taken prisoner of war by the Russians during the battles near the mountain Makivka (Carpathian Mountains) and interned in a POW camp near Tsaritsyn, Chornyi Yar. In 1916 he was transferred into the concentration camp near Dubovka. While in captivity he joined a group of former Galician officers (such as Andrii Melnyk, Roman Sushko, and Fed Chernyk among others) who fled to Kyiv together. In November 1917, together with the Galician-Bucovina Committee, he organized the Halytsko-Bukovynsky Kurin of the Sich Riflemen as part of the Doroshenko Regiment. Two months later he assumed its command and helped suppress the Communist uprising in Kyiv as well as resisting the Antonov-Ovseenko offensive. In March 1918 his riflemen, together with the Zaporizhia Corps of the Ukrainian People's Republic and the reformed Haydamaky Kish of the Sloboda Ukraine, liberated Kyiv from the Soviets. In May 1918 his military unit was disbanded due to its political views. =Political career= In the summer of 1918 he convinced Pavlo Skoropadskyi, Hetman of Ukraine, to create a Special Platoon of Sich Riflemen, which was established in Bila Tserkva. In November 1918 he officially requested a void of the Federal Union with Russia from the Hetmanate and actively supported the forces of the Directoria in the (fought at , near Motovylivka, Kiev Oblast) in the ousting of Skoropadskyi. On December 6, 1919, by the Order of the Head Otoman he demobilized his military formations. The same year he was taken prisoner and interned in a Polish POW camp in Lutsk, although he was released in the spring of 1920 and moved to Czecho-Slovakia. In 1920, as a result of the shattered struggle for Ukrainian independence, Konovalets set up a new organization capable of clandestine activities within the borders of the new occupying powers, Poland, Russian SFSR, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. Created in August of that year in Prague, the Ukrainian Military Organization (UVO) was aimed at armed resistance against Poland and Russia and was involved in the military training of youth and the prevention of any form of cooperation between Ukrainian and Polish authorities. The foundation of the organization became the leaders of the Ukrainian Halych Army. After the end of the Polish-Soviet War and the battle for Lviv, Konovalets became the leader of the UVO in the city. However, after several acts of sabotage his organisation was broken by the police, and in December 1922 Konovalets fled the country. =Exile and assassination= During his exile years he lived in Czechoslovakia, Germany, Switzerland and Italy. In 1929 he took part in the first congress of Ukrainian nationalists in Vienna. During the congress it was decided to form the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN), and Konovalets was elected as its leader. He then actively promoted its influence among the Ukrainian emigres throughout Europe and America while establishing contacts with intelligence offices of Lithuania, Germany, Italy, Great Britain, and others. With his direct help were formed the Societies of Sich Riflemen in North America. The goal of the OUN was to revive an independent Ukraine through armed struggle. Konovalets' activities raised fears in the Kremlin because of penetration of the OUN into the Soviet Union. On May 23, 1938, he was assassinated in Rotterdam by a bomb rigged to explode hidden inside a box of chocolates. This booby-trap was disguised as a present from a close friend. This friend, however, was in reality an NKVD agent who had infiltrated the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists, Pavel Sudoplatov, who on a recent visit to the Soviet Union had been personally ordered by Joseph Stalin to assassinate Konovalets in retaliation for the assassination of a Soviet diplomat at the consulate in Lviv in 1933. Pavel Sudoplatov had beforehand slipped into Finland in July 1935 using the alias 'Pavel Gridgdenko' after a period of training. According to Sudoplatov, Stalin had told him, \\"This is not just an act of revenge, although Konovalets is an agent of German fascism. Our goal is to behead the movement of Ukrainian fascism on the eve of the war and force these gangsters to annihilate each other in a struggle for power.\\"Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks: The Memoirs of an Unwanted Witness, a Soviet Spymaster, pages 23-24. Legacy Tomb of Yevhen Konovalets in Rotterdam Due to his sudden disappearance, the OUN immediately suspected Sudoplatov of Konovalets' murder. Therefore, a photograph of Sudoplatov and Konovalets together was distributed to every OUN unit. According to Sudoplatov, > In the 1940s, SMERSH... captured two guerilla fighters in Western Ukraine, > one of whom had this photo of me on him. When asked why he was carrying it, > he replied, \\"I have no idea why, but the order is if we find this man to > liquidate him.\\"Pavel Sudoplatov, Special Tasks, page 16. =Commemoration= In 2006, the Lviv city administration announced the future transference of the remains of Yevhen Konovalets, Stepan Bandera, Andriy Melnyk and other key leaders of OUN/UPA to a new area of Lychakivskiy Cemetery specifically dedicated to heroes of the Ukrainian liberation movement.Information website of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group On June 17, 2011 in Vilnius, Lithuania took place the conference \\"Yevhen Konovalets: Lithuanian citizen - the Ukrainian patriot.

The hospital became the subject of media coverage in 2013 when, in the midst of nationwide controversy over inconsistent hospital charges, The New York Times reported that the hospital \\"charged the highest amounts in the country for nearly one-quarter of the most common hospital treatments\\", which the Times associated with its 2008 restructuring after being acquired out of bankruptcy the previous year. In the same year, the hospital was ordered to award a \\"whistleblower\\" $2.1 million for being fired. According to a study conducted by National Nurses United and released in January 2014, the hospital was the 9th most expensive in the state, charging 763% above costs. Bayonne Medical Center entered the national spotlight again in 2014, when an investigative news team at NBC 4 New York reported that the hospital charged a New Jersey teacher nearly US$9,000 to bandage his middle finger. In 2015 a follow-up investigation covered the story of a Bayonne resident who was charged over $17,000 for stitches on a two-inch cut.

History  The village was first mentioned in 1326 in the register of Peter's Pence payment among Catholic parishes of O≈õwiƒôcim deaconry of the Diocese of Krak√≥w as Damcowicz. Politically the village belonged then to the Duchy of O≈õwiƒôcim, formed in 1315 in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland and was ruled by a local branch of Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia. In 1457 Jan IV of O≈õwiƒôcim agreed to sell the duchy to the Polish Crown, and in the accompanying document issued on 21 February the village was mentioned as Damkowicze. The territory of the Duchy of O≈õwiƒôcim was eventually incorporated into Poland in 1564 and formed Silesian County of Krak√≥w Voivodeship. Upon the First Partition of Poland in 1772 it became part of the Austrian Kingdom of Galicia. After World War I and fall of Austria-Hungary it became part of Poland.

Each of the 12 issues were a one- shot (feature issue #1 on the cover), however they formed a larger story-arc in which The Justice League of America fights the Injustice League formed by villain Agamemno. The art, dialogue, narrative style and even the format of the comics (larger page-counts, half-page advertisements, etc.) were deliberately anachronistic for the time of publication, thus the issues served as a tribute, and in some cases a gentle satire, to the books and creators of DC Comics during the Silver Age of Comic Books.  Issues  Note that all the issue titles were prefixed with \\"Silver Age,\\" to distinguish them from the monthly series DC produced, even though only Flash and Green Lantern were in print at the time (though starring later incarnations of the heroes). The current Justice League book was then titled JLA and Teen Titans was being published as simply 'The Titans'. = Silver Age = by Mark Waid & Terry Dodson The spacefaring villain Agamemno travels to Earth where he finds Lex Luthor and explains his scheme for universal domination. The villain hopes to achieve his goal by combining three artifacts: The Absorbascon from Thanagar, a piece of Jewel Kryptonite and the Central Power Battery of the Green Lantern Corps on Oa. It is explained that Agamemno needs the power of the JLA to collect these items (partially because two of them have these objects). With Luthor's advice Agamemno assembles a team to oppose the Justice League (The Injustice League) and using his powers swaps the minds of the heroes and villains: Lex Luthor swaps bodies with Superman Chronos swaps bodies with Atom Black Manta swaps bodies with Aquaman Catwoman swaps bodies with Black Canary Doctor Light Swaps bodies with The Martian Manhunter Mr. Element swaps bodies with The Flash Penguin swaps bodies with Batman Felix Faust swaps bodies with Green Arrow Sinestro swaps bodies with Green Lantern The villains are promised the Earth in exchange for aiding Agamemmno and after imprisoning the Justice League, they split up and head off to collect the items. The League manages to escape and, expecting the villains to return in their bodies, initiates a plan to discredit themselves. The deceived Snapper Carr contacts other (Silver Age) heroes to track down the \\"villains\\". = Silver Age: Justice League of America = by Mark Millar & Scot Kolins The Injustice League, in the bodies of the JLA, split up and head into space to collect the items Aggammno requires. Catwoman (Black Canary), Sinestro (GL), Dr Light (Martian Manhunter) and Mr. Element (Flash) travel to Oa where, taking the Lanterns by surprise, they are able to destroy their power rings and steal the central battery. Black Manta (Aquaman), Faust (GA), Chronos (Atom) and Luthor (Superman) travel to an alien planet where they discover a crashed ship that once belonged to Brainiac. Inside are number of shrunken cites (similar to Kandor) one of which (Rikkon Dor) contains the Jewel Kryptonite. Chronos shrinks into the city and gets the kryptonite. He has a moment of conscience and wants to save the shrunken inhabitants (Daxamites) but the rest of the villains smash the shrunken cities. = Silver Age: Challengers of the Unknown = by Karl Kesel & Drew Johnson The Challengers get the call from Snapper Carr and hearing of a break in at Ivy University by Chronos they head out. In the university The Atom (Chronos) is accessing a colleagues \\"time pool\\" to attempt to change the recent past. The Challengers attack The Atom, who uses his shrinking ray on them, but fails to stop their attack. In the middle of the fight prof manages to deduce that Chronos is in fact Ray Palmer and the fight ends. Unfortunately strange creatures from the far future emerge from the time pool. These creatures incapacitate The Atom but the miniature Challengers triumph. Fearing the Challengers will be destroyed before The Atom can enlarge them they are placed in the time pool where time won't pass for them. There they see their future selves (as seen in DC continuity). They also see a glimpse of strange heroes who will defeat the Injustice League. Once restored The Challengers (and The Atom) head off to find these heroes. = Silver Age: Teen Titans = by Marv Wolfman & Pat Olliffe The Titans (Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash, Speedy & Wonder Girl) investigate claims that a small town sheriff is turning teenagers into zombies. Meanwhile, Flash (Mr Element), Batman (The Penguin) & Aquaman (Black Manta) are trying to track down The Titans to aid in their plight. The Titans go undercover and find the accusation to be true but end up captured by the villainous Sheriff Law. The heroes try to help but are ineffective in their new bodies and Batman is captured. The Titans escape the unique traps Law has devised to counter each of them by working together. Aquaman and The Flash arrive but the Titans refuse to believe their claims that they are their mentors and attack. Sheriff Law prevents the heroes from escaping by using his mind control technology to drive the titans into an enraged state. Robin manages to regain his mind long enough for he and Batman to destroy Law's technology and the \\"villains\\" escape. Robin manages to contact Batman (actually the Penguin) and is convinced the heroes were lying. = Silver Age: Dial H for Hero = by Mark Waid & Barry Kitson Robby Reed recounts his origin before joining a school field trip to a local Air Force base. The Martian Manhunter (Dr Light) uses Light's power to create the illusion that the JLA has gone rogue and are attacking. Robby uses the H-Dial to transform and interferes but inadvertently reveals his identity to The Manhunter. The Martian Manhunter ultimately succeeds in his illusion and word is spread that the JLA are now evil. = Silver Age: Flash = by Brian Augustyn, Ty Templeton & Norm Breyfogle The Flash (Mr Element) uses Mr Element's powers to create the illusion that The Flash has become a thief. Kid Flash and The Elongated Man team up to prove that Barry Allen is innocent. At a charity gala Flash plans his big finale revealing he is now a villain but Kid Flash and Elongated Man reveal that \\"Mr Element\\" is behind the deception (thus foiling Barry's plan). This issue also features a story in which Barry Allen fights The Turtle. = Silver Age: Doom Patrol = by Tom Peyer & Sergio Cariello Lex Luthor (actually Superman) makes a public statement that the JLA have become evil. The Chief uses a machine of his own invention that measures morality and seeing that Luthor is now good agrees to help him. Garguax and General Immortus have discovered Agamemno's plans as well as a cache of weapons belonging to Luthor that are designed to destroy the JLA. They hope to steal the weapons and use them against to the Injustice Gang's new bodies to claim power for themselves. After meeting with \\"Luthor\\" the Doom Patrol decide to track down the weapons and the villains who have stolen them. The anti JLA weapons prove effective against the DP as well but with \\"Luthor's\\" aid they win the day and are convinced he is telling the truth that the JLA have gone bad. = Silver Age: The Brave and the Bold = by Bob Haney & Kevin Maguire Will Magnus and The Metal Men are recruited by the US Military to aid Batman (actually The Penguin) against Felix Faust (actually Green Arrow) and Catwoman (Black Canary). GA hopes that he can use Faust's powers to swap their bodies back and goes to the Gotham City Library where the Metal Men attack. Magnus is injured in the resulting battle and Platinum (who is in love with him) carries him to safety. The Metal Men attack again but this time GA unleashes a spell that transforms them into humans. Platinum visits the recovering Magnus but realises he loves his robots (not her) and convinces the others they need to be changed back. Magnus uses his science to return the Metal Men to normal and the robots again go after the \\"villains\\" but they escape, again using faust's magic. Inexplicably the Penguin transforms back into his normal form. = Silver Age: Green Lantern = by Kurt Busiek & Brent Anderson Agamemno and the Injustice League (Still in the bodies of the JLA) travel to Thanagar where they use the League's reputation to get the Thanagarians to hand over the Absorbascon. However Sinestro (actually Green Lantern) attacks the League and does an excellent job of defeating them and Agamemno. In doing so he begins to become exceedingly violent and realises that without the yellow impurity of the GL Power Rings Sinestro's ring is driving him insane. Hal has a flashback to a battle with Sonar that inspires him to try a less 'head-on' approach. He enters the stolen GL Central Power Battery and uses his ring and the battery's power to restore the villains' (and thus the heroes') true forms. The villains escape and are confronted by the Green Lantern Corps in orbit but are able to shut down the minds of the GLC using the combined objects. = Silver Age: Showcase = by Geoff Johns & Dick Giordano Deadman discovers the villain's plan and gathers Adam Strange, Gardner Grayle (Shining Knight), Batgirl, Mento, Metamorpho and Major Blackhawk to help him. They use Blackhawk's plane and Adam's Zeta Beam to travel to Rann and confront the Injustice League. They cannot however prevent Agamemno from assembling the items. When he does he is seemingly destroyed as Luthor replaced the jewel Kryptonite with a diamond. The villains then take the power for themselves and head back to earth. The Zeta beam fades and the team is returned to Earth as well. = Silver Age: 80-Page Giant = by Mark Waid & Eduardo Barreto The JLA, now back in their regular bodies, are updated on the events that took place on Rann by Snapper Carr and the Seven Soldiers of Victory who have also recruited the Doom Patrol, The Metal Men, The Teen Titan's and The Elongated Man to help. Having assembled the objects the Injustice League now possess the combined knowledge of everyone on Earth and use this information to defeat the combined heroes. The Martian Manhunter comes up with a plan and flies off while the rest of the JLA re-enter the fray. The Manhunter arrives in time to save the Heroes with Robby Reed's H-Dial. Transformed into heroes of which no one knows anything, The JLA are able to defeat the Injustice League. Unfortunately the victory is short lived as Agamemno returns, his body now composed of the three combined weapons and more powerful than ever. The Earth is saved at the last minute by a phalanx of Hawkmen and the Green Lantern Corps (It's revealed in flashback that they were saved by the combined efforts of Kid Flash, Deadman and Adam Strange). Agamemno is trapped inside the Central Power battery and the villains have the secrets they've stolen wiped by the Absorbascon. Robby Reed is proclaimed the hero of the day. This issue also features four back-up stories: Batman fighting The Mad Hatter by E. Nelson Bridwell & Wayne Boring, Superman's Pal Jimmy Olsen with art by Pete Costanza (writer uncredited), a Wonder Girl (young Diana in this case) imaginary tale by Mark Waid & Ty Templeton, and the origin story of Super- Turtle. = Silver Age: Secret Files & Origins = This issue features a prequel to the above story in which Aggamemno finds out about the JLA and the villains that make up the Injustice Gang from Kanjar Ro and watches the Justice League fight Despero in his original form. The other stories include: A Super-Turtle story. Hawk & Dove (Hank and Don Hall) teaming up with The Creeper and a Dial H for Hero story. There are \\"true science facts\\" in the form of \\"Flash Facts,\\" \\"Metal Men Facts and Fancies\\" & \\"Metamorpho's Chemical Curiosities.\\" there are also a map of the original JLA Secret Sanctuary, and a guide to the Cosmic treadmill. Unusually this issue also contains behind the scenes information on the cover art of the series.  Effects  The events of this story were referenced by Batman during the JLA storyline \\"Tower of Babel\\" as his reason for creating his contingencies against his team mates.
