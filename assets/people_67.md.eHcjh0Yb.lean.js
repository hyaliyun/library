It was discovered on 4 March 1907, by German astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The asteroid was named after the Greek goddess Charis, a name which may have been inspired by the asteroid's provisional designation 1907 XS. ('Charis' is in Greek is spelled 'Χάρις'.)  Orbit and classification  Charis is the parent body of the Charis family (), an asteroid family of more than 800 known members. It orbits the Sun in the outer main-belt at a distance of 2.7–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 11 months (1,804 days; semi-major axis of 2.90 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.06 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in March 1907.  Physical characteristics  The overall spectral type for members of the Charis family is that of a C- and X-type. In the SMASS classification Charis is an X-type asteroid, while in the Tholen classification, its type is ambiguous, closest to an X- and somewhat similar to a carbonaceous B-type asteroid including a reported noisy spectrum (XB:). Conversely, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) characterized it as a primitive P-type asteroid. = Rotation period = Photometric observations of this asteroid by American astronomer Frederick Pilcher at the Organ Mesa Observatory () in Las Cruces, New Mexico, during May 2012 gave a well-defined lightcurve with a rotation period of 27.888 hours and a brightness variation of 0.35 in magnitude (). The result supersedes a tentative period of at least 24 hours obtained by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini in March 2011 (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Charis measures between 38.018 and 62.68 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.047 and 0.0925. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0786 and a diameter of 48.51 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.95.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology, after the goddess Charis, the wife of Hephaestus after whom the minor planet was also named. The official naming citation was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().

History From October 9, 1984-May 18, 1985, Theater station served as the northern terminus, as Metro Rail officially opened for regular service on May 20, 1985. From May 20, 1985-November 10, 1986, due to construction issues at LaSalle, Amherst Street served as the northern terminus. Prior to 2005, Theater station served as the southern terminus, as the Taste of Buffalo was held along Main Street between Chippewa and Church Streets (it has since moved to Delaware Avenue between West Chippewa and West Eagle Streets). Since November 10, 1986, University Station serves as the northern terminus. Prior to February 18, 2013, Theater was the last above-ground station, with the subway portal directly north of the station, which caused safety issues partially leading to decision to close rather than relocate the station.

The Beast Within was also made into a movie in 1982. History Brooklyn-born writer Edward Levy wrote his first novel, Came a Spider, in 1978. The Beast Within followed in 1981. Levy published a third novel in 2020, entitled Something Most Evil. levy's novel The Beast Within was also made into a movie in 1982. Plot summary The book begins in the 1920s on the farm of Henry and Sarah Scruggs. Henry is a fanatically religious man who believes that people are vile and base, and that sex—even marital sex—is repulsive and sinful. Sarah, who is much younger than Henry, disagrees. One day a traveling salesman by the name of Jimmy Connors shows up at the farm, telling them that his car broke down. Feeling unusually hospitable, Henry gives the man some dinner and lets him sleep in the barn for the night. After she thinks that her husband has fallen asleep, Sarah sneaks out to the barn and is seduced by Connors. Unfortunately for the both of them, Henry catches them in the act and knocks Connors unconscious. When he awakens he finds himself chained in Henry's basement. Henry tells him that he has murdered Sarah and that he plans on keeping him prisoner for \\"a long time\\". Connors is held captive for over twenty years, and eventually the constant abuse, the grotesque food, and the horror of his situation drive him to become more beast than man. He loses all memory of who he once was and is simply an animal content to live its life in bondage. But Henry dies and the creature escapes from its prison into the surrounding forest in order to avoid starvation. It finds its way close to the home of Eli and Carolyn MacCleary, a young married couple. One night when Eli is at work Carolyn ventures outside and is knocked unconscious by the creature, which was hunting for food and became frightened at her approach. Some long-forgotten instinct awakens in the beast and it rapes her. After it has finished it leaves her alone in the forest to resume its search for food. It tries to catch a snake but is bitten and dies from the serpent's venom. Carolyn becomes pregnant from the attack, but is unaware of her rape and so assumes that the child is her husband's. The baby is born and they name him Michael. Michael is an affectionate child, but they notice strange things about him. Animals have a bizarre reaction to him, and he is intensely claustrophobic. As he begins to grow, his parents discover that when night falls a strange transformation overcomes him, as if his entire personality has changed. He slips into trances and prowls the forest, killing the animals that he comes across. Eli boards up his windows to prevent him from escaping at night, and soon thereafter Michael's \\"spells\\" seem to relent...until he hits puberty, at least. As a teenager Michael falls in love with a girl he knows from school, but he is also afraid of hurting her because of his transformations. However, he lets his guard down and even decides that he wants to marry her. Before they can leave together, though, he kills a bully at school who tried to attack him. Wanting to get out of town as soon as possible, he and his girlfriend drive to her house to pick up some of her things. As it turns out, her house used to be the home of Henry Scruggs, and from the moment he steps in the door the beast within him (which consists of the emotions, senses, and savage hungers of the creature that was his biological father) springs to the surface and he is left violently insane. Instead of confining him in a mental institution, his parents decide to keep him in the house's cellar, hoping for the day that he might recover. Reception The Dayton Daily News said that the book \\"is not for everyone. Attacks are described in graphic detail... Still, the characters are convincingly developed, and for those who like a good fright, The Beast Within keeps on delivering.\\" The Raleigh News and Observer also called the book \\"a gripping thriller of lycanthropy in the Ozarks.\\" However, the Johnson City Press said that in the ending, \\"Levy seems to have mixed his manifestations at the last minute, from the near plausible to the impossible, leaving the reader feeling slightly misled.\\" Film adaptation The Beast Within is a 1982 Hollywood horror film loosely based on the novel. Hollywood producer Harvey Bernhard heard the title of the Levy novel from an Arbor House book catalog and he purchased the rights before the book was finished. Since the book was not even written yet, the movie has little resemblance to the novel. The film was panned by The New York Times: they called the film a \\"very foolish horror film\\".

It was discovered on 8 September 1907, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The meaning of the asteroids's name is unknown.  Classification and orbit  Agnes is a stony S-type asteroid and a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the asteroid belt. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,208 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.13 and an inclination of 2° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with a recovered observation at Vienna Observatory, one month after its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In March 1975, photometric observations by Swedish astronomer Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist measured a period of 8.9 hours for Agnes. The lightcurve, however, was fragmentary and the result uncertain (). In October 2013, the first reliable rotational lightcurve of Agnes was obtained by astronomers Frederick Pilcher, Lorenzo Franco and Luis Martinez at Organ Mesa and Balzaretto Observatory respectively. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of 178.0 hours with a brightness variation of 0.55 magnitude (). The team also assumed a standard albedo for stony S-type asteroids of 0.20, calculated an absolute magnitude of 12.64, estimated a mean diameter of kilometers, and measured a V–R color index of 0.50. With such a long rotation period, Agnes is a slow rotator, of which a few hundred minor planets are currently known. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, Agnes measures between 8.26 and 9.74 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an albedo between 0.21 and 0.30. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results obtained by Pilcher, and calculates a diameter of 8.81 kilometers.  Naming  Any reference of this minor planet's name to a person or occurrence is unknown. = Unknown meaning = Among the many thousands of named minor planets, Agnes is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published.

It was discovered by American astronomer reverend Joel Metcalf at Taunton, Massachusetts, USA, on 13 September 1907. The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.7 AU once every 5 years and 9 months (2,103 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.15 and is tilted by 7 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric light-curve analysis from the 1980s and a provisional observation in 2004 rendered a rotation period of 32.6 and 34.4 hours, respectively. According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the U.S.Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid has a dissimilar albedo in the range of 0.14 to 0.23, which leads to a varying estimate for its diameter from 28 to 36 kilometers. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link publishes an albedo of 0.23 from an alternative result of the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey (SIMPS) and derives a slightly lower diameter of 27.9 kilometers. The minor planet was named for two women of ancient Roman history. Agrippina the Elder (14 BCE – 33) was the daughter of the Roman statesman Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa, the wife of Germanicus and the mother of the Emperor Caligula. Her daughter, Agrippina the Younger (15–59 AD) was the mother of Emperor Nero. The naming might be influenced by the two letters of the provisional designation 1907 AG. In the Dictionary of Minor Planet Names, Lutz Schmadel supposes that the name originated from a list of female names from mythology and history, compiled by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) in 1913. The ARI then sent this list to a number of astronomers with the request to name their discoveries in order to avoid confusion, as the number of unnamed minor planet up to number 700 had grown significantly at the time.

The origin of the asteroid's name is unknown, it may be derived from the name of Princess Adelgunde of Bavaria.  Orbit and classification  Adelgunde orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 2.0–2.9 AU once every 3 years and 10 months (1,393 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, Adelgundes observation arc begins with its official discovery observation.

Based on the survey carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, it measures 13.7 kilometers with an albedo of 0.26. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) agrees with the results obtained by AKARI, assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and calculates a diameter of 15.5 kilometers with an absolute magnitude of 11.41. As the diameters are typically inferred from the body's absolute brightness and its reflectively, a higher albedo results in a smaller diameter. = Spectral type = Adelgunde is an X-type asteroid on the Tholen taxonomic scheme, while CALL assumes it to be a stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In August 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Adelgunde was obtained from photometric observations by astronomers Pierre Antonini and Antonio Vagnozzi. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.28 in magnitude ().  Name  The origin of this minor planet's name is unknown.

In the late 1920s Robey Leibbrandt established himself as an accomplished pugilist. Leibbrandt represented South Africa at the 1934 Empire Games and won the light heavyweight bronze medal. He also represented South Africa at the Berlin Olympics in 1936, competing in the light heavyweight class. He was not able to fight the bronze medal bout to Francisco Risiglione and finished fourth. He became South African heavyweight champion on 31 July 1937 in Johannesburg, beating Jim Pentz. German military service Following his stay in Germany for the 1936 Berlin Olympics, during which he had been deeply impressed with Adolf Hitler and Nazi Germany, Leibbrandt returned to Berlin in 1938 to study at the Reich Academy for Gymnastics, and remained when World War 2 began in 1939. He subsequently volunteered with the Wehrmacht, with which he became the first South African to be trained as a Fallschirmjäger, and a glider pilot.

Leibbrandt left Germany on 5 April 1941 under the agent code-name Walter Kempf. In June 1941 after a sea voyage down the North and South Atlantic Oceans he was put ashore from an Abwehr operated captured French sail-boat called Kyloe, captained by Christian Nissen, on the Namaqualand coast north of Cape Town.

Leibbrandt’s group launched a series of small-scale guerrilla warfare operations against infrastructure targets, dynamiting power lines and railway tracks, and cutting telephone and telegraph cables. During an engagement with South African Army troops in late 1942, Leibbrandt was recognised, and consequently became a fugitive. He was captured in Pretoria in late December 1942 after a tip-off given to the authorities. During his trial on charges of High Treason, Leibbrandt refused to participate except to state that he had acted for \\"Volk & Fuhrer\\", and to give a Nazi salute to the court. On 11 March 1943 the court sentenced him to death. After hearing the sentence pronounced he shouted \\"I welcome death!\\", to the receipt of some cheering from a handful of supporters in the court's public gallery. To avoid making Leibbrandt a martyr and risk increasing pro-Nazi sympathies among the Afrikaners, the sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by Prime Minister Jan Smuts.'A South African Traitor & Operation Weissdoen', 16 June 2016, 'The Observation Post - South African Contemporary Military History' website. https://samilhistory.com/2016/06/16/south-africas-nazi-insurgent-robey- leibbrandt Post-war In 1948 Leibbrandt had his sentence quashed in a general amnesty enacted by the new National Party Government under the leadership of Daniel François Malan, a party that had opposed South Africa's involvement into World War 2 on the side of the British Empire, and had a policy of neutrality in the conflict. When Leibbrandt was released from prison he was met at its entrance by a small crowd of Afrikaners, who treated him as a \\"folk hero\\".'A South African Traitor & Operation Weissdorn', 16 June 2016. In the late 1940s he returned briefly to professional boxing, winning a handful of fights. Leibbrandt remained politically active in later life, founding the 'Anti-Communist Protection Front' in 1962, and producing a series of pamphlets entitled Wake up South Africa. Death Leibbrandt died on 1 August 1966 at Ladybrand from a heart attack in his 54th year. His body was buried in Ladybrand Cemetery.Entry for Robey Leibbrandt in Geni.com https://www.geni.com/people/Sidney-Leibbrandt/6000000056649025079 Personal life Leibbrandt fathered a son named Bernd with Edda Matusch in Austria in July 1940.

Hoeppner (February 1, 1936 - October 22, 2015) was a Canadian former politician. He served in the House of Commons of Canada from 1993 to 2000, initially with the Reform Party and later as an independent Member of Parliament (MP). Early life Hoeppner was born on a Russian Mennonite family in Morden, Manitoba, did not finish high school, and worked as a farmer for thirty-five years. Between 1968 and 1984, he served on the Snowflake School Board, and Pembina Valley School Board and the MCI Collegiate Board (Gretna). He was also a member of the Provisional Board of Keystone Agricultural Producers, District 2 and Southern Co-op Feeders Ltd. He first became a public figure in 1971, when he opposed the provincial government's crop-insurance scheme and received twice what he was initially promised in a hailstone-damage claim.The Globe and Mail, 31 July 1999 Political career He was first elected to the House of Commons in the 1993 federal election, defeating Liberal candidate Grant Johnson by 4,655 votes in Lisgar—Marquette. Hoeppner was the only Reform MP to be elected from a Manitoba riding in this election, and was one of only two party MPs elected east of Saskatchewan. Hoeppner launched a lawsuit against the Canadian Wheat Board in 1995, alleging that the board had charged insufficient buy-back prices to grain companies and had not properly distributed the money it received. The case was thrown out of court in 1998, and Hoeppner was ordered to pay the Wheat Board's legal fees. Hoeppner has alleged that the Wheat Board withholds information from producers, though others have disputed his claims. In 1996, he spoke out against a federal measure that extended anti-discrimination provisions to homosexuals by claiming that homosexuality was the cause of civil war in Liberia and Zambia. These comments were widely ridiculed, and Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy referred to Hoeppner's observations as \\"probably the most ultimate example of stupidity I've seen (from) a Reform MP\\".Winnipeg Free Press, 10 May 1996 He was re-elected in the 1997 election, defeating Progressive Conservative candidate Brian Pallister by 1,449 votes in the redistributed riding of Portage—Lisgar. Pallister had been a star candidate for the Progressive Conservatives, and was seen by some as the favourite to win the riding. After the election, Hoeppner promoted the idea of running provincial Reform Party candidates in Manitoba (there had previously been an organization called the Reform Party of Manitoba, but it was not affiliated with the federal party). One independent Reformer campaigned in a 1997 provincial by-election, but the idea went no further.Winnipeg Free Press, 19 July 1997. He considered leaving the party in 1998, but chose to stay after receiving promises that it would devote more attention to agriculture.The Globe and Mail, 17 October 1998 Hoeppner was excluded from the Reform Party caucus on July 27, 1999, after criticizing party leader Preston Manning and strategist Rick Anderson for their plans to fold Reform into the United Alternative. Hoeppner later announced his plans to challenge Manning for the United Alternative leadership, though this came to nothing.Toronto Star, 17 August 1999. He was permanently expelled from caucus later in the year, and changed his parliamentary designation to \\"Independent Reform\\" on September 28. On April 4, 2000, he changed his designation to \\"Independent\\". Hoepnner was accused of assaulting Reform MP Inky Mark at a meeting in September 1999, but was cleared of the charge in May 2000.Winnipeg Free Press, 18 May 2000. He sought re-election in the 2000 federal campaign and this time finished a distant fourth against Pallister, who was now a candidate of the Canadian Alliance. Hoeppner openly used $10,500 taken from the Portage—Lisgar Canadian Alliance Association in this election, claiming that the money belonged to him.Winnipeg Free Press, 7 October 2000. The Alliance later sued to recover the money.Winnipeg Free Press, 20 June 2003. Controversy Hoeppner once blamed women for inciting male violence, claiming \\"as kids we were always taught at home when we went to get the cattle out of the pasture not to wear red because it would infuriate the bull\\".Winnipeg Free Press, 5 December 2003. After politics After leaving office, Hoeppner was involved with \\"Farmers for Justice\\", a conservative agrarian group seeking to reduce the powers of the Canadian Wheat Board Hoeppner was later skeptical about efforts to merge the Canadian Alliance with the Progressive Conservatives to form the Conservative Party of CanadaWinnipeg Free Press, 28 October 2003. He also brought a series of lawsuits against former leaders of the Reform Party, including one in 2004 for \\"embarrassment, damage to his reputation and humiliation\\" resulting from his expulsion from the party five years earlier.Winnipeg Free Press, 21 February 2004.

Her main mast rises above the deck. She carries 22 sails totaling about and can reach a top speed of under sail. She has a sparred length of , a width of , a draught of , and a displacement at full load of . Ship history The three-masted ship was launched under the name Albert Leo Schlageter on 30 October 1937 at Blohm & Voss in Hamburg for Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine. The ship was named after Albert Leo Schlageter, who was executed in 1923 by French forces occupying the Ruhr area. Her first commander was Bernhard Rogge. Sagres is a sister ship of the Gorch Fock, the Horst Wessel, and the Romanian training vessel Mircea. Another sister, Herbert Norkus, was not completed, while Gorch Fock II was built in 1958 by the Germans to replace the ships lost after the war. Following a number of international training voyages, the ship was used as a stationary office ship after the outbreak of World War II and was only put into ocean-going service again in 1944 in the Baltic Sea. On 14 November 1944 she hit a Soviet mine off Sassnitz and had to be towed to port in Swinemünde. Eventually transferred to Flensburg, she was taken over there by the Allies when the war ended and finally confiscated by the United States. The Sagres at OpSail 2000 Sagres at dock in Mar del Plata, Argentina, February 2010 In 1948, the U.S. sold her to Brazil for a symbolic price of $5,000 USD. She was towed to Rio de Janeiro where she sailed as a school ship for the Brazilian Navy under the name Guanabara. In 1961, Ambassador Teotónio Pereira of Portugal, who was also a man of the sea, loved sailing ships, and had been an organizer of the first Tall Ships’ Race, persevered in his mediations and the Portuguese Navy bought the Guanabara to replace the previous school ship Sagres (which was transferred to Hamburg, where she is a museum ship under her original name Rickmer Rickmers). The Portuguese Navy renamed Guanabara as Sagres (the third ship of that name), where she remains in service to this day. In 2010, the ship performed her longest voyage, a round the world trip performing an approximate total of 35000 miles, under the command of CMG Pedro Proença Mendes. The ship left Lisbon on 19 January and returned on 24 December, having participated in Velas Sudamerica 2010, a historic Latin American tour by eleven tall ships to celebrate the bicentennial of the first national governments of Argentina and Chile. She also took part in the Expo Shanghai, among other events during that year. The ship has sailed under the Portuguese flag since 1962. For that reason, in 2012 there were major commemorations of her 75th anniversary and 50 years in the service of the Portuguese navy.

In 1897 as Holy Ghost Apostolic College, a preparatory school and junior-college seminary for young men studying to become members of the religious order of the Holy Ghost Fathers and Brothers. In the 1950s, the school started to move its college-level program to Duquesne University and opened its doors to non-seminarians in 1959 for the first time. In 1967, the seminary program was discontinued, and a year later Holy Ghost Preparatory School was formed as a non-profit institution. In the 1990s, the school began a long-range planning process, which resulted in significant structural enhancements to the campus, and today its enrollment consists entirely of non- resident college-bound students. Since the arrival of Gregory J. Geruson, a 1979 alum, as the school's first lay president in 2015, the school has experienced numerous changes. The school's \\"Vision 2020\\" Strategic Plan has resulted in the building of a new STEM Tower. Step One of the STEM Tower, the Brennan Innovation Center, opened in August 2017. The rest of the STEM Tower was completed in time for the start of the 2018-19 school year. In early 2018, the school also opened the Holt Center, which includes a performing arts center, a multi-purpose gymnasium, music instruction rooms, and special training areas for baseball, track and field, golf, lacrosse, and rowing. The Holt Center serves Holy Ghost students but also will be available to community groups. Student body Holy Ghost consists of nearly 500 students. Located near the I-95 corridor in metropolitan Philadelphia, the school attracts students from more than 100 feeder schools from Bucks County, other metropolitan Philadelphia counties, and New Jersey.

Prototypes were built in 1936 but never entered production. Design and development In 1934, the Reich Air Ministry (RLM) declared a requirement for a Kampfzerstörer (battle destroyer), a tactical multi-role fighter/bomber concept, and a possible predecessor to the late-1930s German Schnellbomber concept. Focke- Wulf submitted the Fw 57, Messerschmitt submitted the Bf 110 and Henschel submitted the Hs 124. The Fw 57 was larger than its two competitors; it was heavier and did not handle as well as them. The Fw 57 was a twin-engine all- metal monoplane of conventional configuration, with a single fin and rearwards-retracting maingear members comprising its tailwheel undercarriage, into the engine nacelles. The pilot and navigator sat in tandem under a long canopy, the aft end of which had a gunner's turret. Three Fw 57 prototypes (V1-V3) were completed during 1936. The aircraft was severely overweight and handled poorly. The original Kampfzerstörer concept, which specified a multi- role aircraft with turret-mounted armament had been abandoned by autumn 1936 in favor of the simpler Zerstörer represented by the Bf 110, which omitted gun turrets and bombing capability to allow greater performance. All further research into the Fw 57 was abandoned shortly thereafter.Green and Swanborough 1994, p. 213.Green 1972, pp. 176–178. Specifications (Fw 57 V1) right References *Green, William.

It was discovered on 23 July 1908, by German astronomer August Kopff at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, and named after Desdemona, character in Shakespeare's The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice. The name may have been inspired by the asteroid's provisional designation 1908 DM.  Classification and orbit  Desdemona is a stony S-type asteroid that orbits the Sun in the middle main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,525 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.24 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the asteroid's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg.  Physical characteristics  = Rotation period = In 2013, a rotational lightcurve for this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by astronomer Anna Marciniak at Poznań Observatory, Poland. It gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.22 in magnitude (), superseding a period from in 2000, obtained at the Californian Santana Observatory (), which gave a slightly longer period of hours and an amplitude of 0.11 (). Between 2004 and 2006, three more lightcurves were constructed from photometric observations, but they were all fragmentary and based on results with less than full coverage (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid's surface has an albedo between 0.095 and 0.106. While the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link agrees with the space-based IRAS and Akari surveys on a diameter of approximately 27 kilometers, the results from WISE and NEOWISE found a larger diameter of 31.5 to 32.7 kilometers, respectively.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Desdemona, the wife of Othello in the play The Tragedy of Othello, the Moor of Venice written by William Shakespeare in 1604 (also see ). It is presumed that the naming of \\"Desdemona\\" could have been inspired by the two letters of its provisional designation (1908 DM). One of the satellites of Uranus (Uranus X), discovered by the Voyager 2 in 1986, is also named Desdemona ().

He was appointed military commandant of Athens, promoted to Major General and aide de camp to the king. In 1845 he was dismissed by the army and withdrew from Greece, following an incident between him and Queen Amalia. He went to London, where he became friend with Louis Napoleon, nephew of Napoleon I and later Emperor of the French, which he followed later in Paris and so he became follower of the French policy. In 1848 he made an abortive descent on the Greek coast, in the hope of launching a revolution in the Greek kingdom. He was captured, but soon released and, after a stay in the island of Zante, went to Paris (1853). In 1854, during the Crimean War, he served as Minister of Military Affairs in the Alexandros Mavrokordatos cabinet—imposed by the British and French, and hence called \\"Ministry of Occupation\\" by the Greeks.

He was born in Velyka Znamianka, Ukraine in a poor Jewish family as the 9th child. He completed secondary education in Kherson, Ukraine; then studied for a year in Rostov, Russia and moved to Saint Petersburg seeking university degree. There he studied in several technical universities. Engineering however did not attract Shatunovsky and he dedicated himself to mathematics, voluntarily attending lectures by Chebyshev. Shatunovsky could not complete any university program due to lack of funds. He later attempted to obtain a university degree in Switzerland, but failed for the same reason. After returning from Switzerland, he lived in small Russian towns, earning by private lessons. In the meantime, he wrote his first mathematical papers and sent some of them to Odessa University. Their quality was acknowledged; Shatunovsky was admitted to the university, received financial support, obtained a degree and was appointed as staff member in 1905. In 1917, he became a professor and continued working at the Odessa University through the rest of his life. Shatunovsky focused on several topics in mathematical analysis and algebra, such as group theory, number theory and geometry. Independently from Hilbert, he developed a similar axiomatic theory and applied it in geometry, algebra, Galois theory and analysis. However, most of his activity was devoted to teaching at Odessa University and writing associated books and study materials. Shatunovsky died in 1929 from stomach cancer two days after his 70th birthday. Despite severe pain associated with his illness, he kept his usual sense of humor and continued to lecture almost until the day he died. He was remembered by his students and colleagues for his original approach to mathematical problems and ability to popularize the most complex mathematical ideas.

It was named after the Dutch singer Aaltje Noordewier-Reddingius. This object has a geometric albedo of 0.2794. Photometric observations during 2008 showed a rotation period of 16.6076 ± 0.0006 hours and a brightness variation of 0.30 ± 0.02 in magnitude. 677 Aaltje is orbiting within the 7/3 Kirkwood gap. This means it has a 7:3 orbital resonance with Jupiter, completing seven orbits for every three orbits of the planet. For smaller objects, this would typically lead to orbital instability, causing it to shift to a different orbital period. However, 677 Aaltje is too large for its orbit to have been moved by more than about 0.01 AU over the lifetime of the Solar System. What is more likely is that orbital interactions with the dwarf planet Ceres may have shifted it to the present- day orbit--the orbit of 677 Aaltje leads it into relatively close encounters with Ceres.

Chávez's foreign policy may be roughly divided into that concerned with United States-Venezuela relations and that concerned with Venezuela's relations with other states, particularly those in Latin America and developing countries on other continents. In many respects the policies of the Chávez government were a substantial break from the previous administrations that governed Venezuela. Venezuela chaired the Group of 77 in 2002.United Nations, 11 January 2002, Annan urges 'Group of 77' developing nations to build consensus Policy = Latin American integration = Chávez and former Argentina President Néstor Kirchner discuss energy and trade integration projects for South America. They met on 21 November 2005 in Venezuela. Hugo Chávez refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called \\"oil diplomacy\\".The Economist, 28 July 2005. \\"Using oil to spread revolution\\".

It complements the terms of the San Jose Agreement, through which Venezuela offers special financial conditions to signatory oil- buying countries.\\" Chávez stated that Venezuela has \\"a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage ... It is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States.\\" Chávez made Latin American integration the keystone of his administration's foreign policy. Venezuela worked closely with its neighbors following the 1997 Summit of the Americas in many areas—particularly energy integration—and championed the OAS decision to adopt the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, also being among the first to ratify it (in 1997). Venezuela also participates in the UN Friends groups for Haiti. It became a full member of the Mercosur trade bloc on 31 July 2012, expanding its involvement in the hemisphere's trade integration prospects. The Venezuelan government advocates an end to Cuba's US-imposed isolation and a \\"multi-polar\\" world based on ties among developing countries. Exemplars of this prioritization have come in the cooperative multinational institutions Chávez helped found Petrocaribe, Petrosur, and TeleSUR. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries have also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba,. funding an approximately $300 million ex gratia oil pipeline built to provide discounted natural gas to Colombia,. and initiating barter arrangements that, among other things, exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash- strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. Chavez's re-election in December 2006 was seen as a boost to Cuba.O'Keefe, Derrick. Regimes unchanged: Chavez's election win strengthens alliance with Cuba. Seven Oaks (4 December 2006). Retrieved 4 December 2006. For those Latin American leaders who shared his Bolivarian socialist revolutionary vision of change, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua, and the Castros of Cuba, Chavez was a visionary, a visionary who was able to provide cheap or free oil under the PetroCaribe program. Despite Chavez's active foreign policy, a 2007 Pew Research poll showed that majorities in Bolivia, Brazil, Mexico, Peru, Chile, and a slim plurality in Argentina had little or no confidence in Chavez's handling of world affairs, along with 45% in Venezuela itself. In 2008 confidence in Chavez as a world leader declined to 26% in Argentina, 12% in Brazil, and 6% in Mexico, according to Pew. Venezuelan opposition-leaning research center CIECA estimated in September 2008 that Venezuela had given 33 billion dollars to members of the ALBA group since its inception =Opposition to perceived \\"neoliberal\\" globalization=  2005 UN World Summit  At the 2005 UN World Summit, Chávez on 15 September mocked and denounced what he perceived to be a neoliberal model of globalization, promulgated by the Washington Consensus, as a fundamentally fraudulent and malicious scheme.VenezuelaAnalysis.com (16 September 2005). Hugo Chávez's Speech to the United Nations. Accessed 1 July 2005.

Chávez summarily denounced the global status quo as a mortal threat to humanity, demanding that a new approach be taken towards satisfying the UN Millennium Development Goals. He also stated that both global warming and imminent hydrocarbon depletion were also fundamentally threatening mankind's wellbeing. His speech concluded to loud applause and raucous cheering from attending delegates. On the same trip, he also visited the Bronx in New York City, and during a speech delivered at a Bronx church on 17 September stated that, notwithstanding any grievances he may have with the Bush administration's foreign policy, he had \\"fallen in love with the soul of the people of the United States\\".

On the tour, he was said to sign a raft of deals including nuclear energy, military supplies such as tanks, and other agricultural deals. In Russia, he would sign an agreement to develop nuclear energy, the purchase of Russian tanks and a bi-national bank. Ukraine and Belarus are both recipients of Venezuelan oil. Relations with Latin American and Caribbean states =Antigua and Barbuda= Antigua and Barbuda enjoys close relations with Venezuela. As of June 2009 it became a formal member of the Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas (ALBA) international cooperation organization and the Caribbean oil alliance Petrocaribe. In 2009 Antigua and Barbuda received US$50 million from Venezuela because of the country's membership of these initiatives. After the American billionaire fraudster Allen Stanford became embroiled in scandal, Hugo Chávez sent urgent financial assistance to Antigua and Barbuda, which was heavily dependent on Stanford's investment when his business empire collapsed. \\"We have benefited from these relationships and so we will continue to forge these alliances, whether it is with Venezuela, Cuba or whoever else that we feel is in the interest of Antigua and Barbuda and the sub-region\\", said the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Baldwin Spencer. =Argentina= In August 2007 a Venezuelan businessman was stopped in Buenos Aires when allegedly trying to smuggle money for the campaign of then first lady and presidential candidate Cristina Fernández de Kirchner on behalf of the Chávez government. =Chile= After the death of Hugo Chávez it was known that on 4 May 2010, during a Unasur summit in Buenos Aires, Chile's right-wing President Sebastián Piñera had agreed with him a verbal previously unreleased personal non-aggression pact.Phillip Durán in Chilean newspaper La Tercera, on 9 March 2013, article El pacto de Buenos Aires, retrieved on 9 March 2013 =Colombia= Colombia and Venezuela share a long and heavily populated border. They are strong commercial partners and have a considerable shared history, reaching back to the colonization of the New Kingdom of Granada and the formation of Gran Colombia after Simón Bolívar's liberation campaign. Colombia, which receives millions of dollars for anti-narcotics purposes from the United States as part of Plan Colombia, is governed by a popular rightwing administration. One of the first impasses occurred in late 2004 after the arrest by Venezuelan officials of Rodrigo Granda, a high-ranking representative of the FARC. Granda was then extradited to Colombia in the border city of Cúcuta in what was known as the Rodrigo Granda affair. At the time, Colombian President Álvaro Uribe condemned what he called Chávez's lack of cooperation in implementing law enforcement actions against the FARC. Chávez responded by temporarily cutting diplomatic and trade ties with Colombia.BBC News (14 January 2005). Venezuela cuts ties with Colombia Accessed 23 May 2006. The issue was put to rest in a summit of the two presidents in February 2005. Chavez also played an important role in mediating with FARC for the release of hostages. He had tried to get FARC's most high-profile hostage Íngrid Betancourt released, only to come out blaming the Colombians for the lack of momentum in talks. This occurred after Chavez, contrary to an agreement with Uribe, called and spoke directly to the Colombian Army chief of staff General Mario Montoya. The agreement called for direct talks with just the heads of state. However, some prisoners, including Clara Rojas Betancourt's top aide who was kidnapped with her, were then released in highly publicized operations. Later, the Andean crisis led to military moves by Venezuela in conjunction with Ecuador after a raid by Colombia on a FARC bases on Ecuadorian-side of the border. After the raid the Colombian army released several documents recovered from a number of laptops seized during the raid, allegedly supporting the existence of links between FARC and Hugo Chávez.\\"Laptop emails link Venezuela to Colombian guerrillas\\" article by Rory Carroll in Caracas and Sibylla Brodzinsky in Bogotá, guardian.co.uk, Friday 16 May 2008\\"Colombia Is Flashpoint in Chávez’s Feud With U.S.\\" article by Simon Romero in The New York Times 5 March 2008 Leonel Fernández, the president of the Dominican Republic, then took the initiative to mend relations. In September 2009, an agreement between Colombia and the U.S. created new tensions between the two countries. The agreement granted the US military supervised access to Colombian air bases for drug interdiction, but was interpreted by Chavez as threat to his country, and has been used as justification for the purchase of nearly 2 billion dollars in weapons from Russia. The 2010 Colombia–Venezuela diplomatic crisis saw a diplomatic stand- off between Colombia and Venezuela over allegations in July 2010 by outgoing President Álvaro Uribe that the Venezuelan government was actively permitting the Colombian FARC and ELN guerillas to seek safe haven in its territory. Uribe presented evidence to the Organization of American States (OAS) allegedly drawn from laptops acquired in Colombia's 2008 raid on a FARC camp in Ecuador, a raid which had sparked the 2008 Andean diplomatic crisis. In response to the allegations Venezuela broke off diplomatic relations, and there was speculation of a possible war. The crisis was resolved after Juan Manuel Santos was inaugurated as the new President of Colombia on 2010, with the intervention of UNASUR bringing together Santos and Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Chávez told the guerillas that there could be no military solution to the internal Colombia conflict,AFP, 2010, Chavez urges Colombian rebels to release all hostages and Santos agreed to turn over the disputed laptops to the Ecuadorean government.AFP, 2010, Colombia, Venezuela, leaders expected to renew ties, archived by WebCite at https://www.webcitation.org/5rxM1Dosz. Colombia and Venezuela agreed to re- establish diplomatic relations. =Brazil= Mercosur summit in 2005 Venezuela and Brazil have been working together on large-scale regional projects. Both Venezuela and Brazil were seen to be leading an initiative to form the Bank of the South (BancoSur), an institution that would pool a portion of participating countries' reserves, and ultimately seeking to replace the International Monetary Fund, as well as its onerous insistence on cutting social and infrastructure programs as conditions for its loans, in return for a more development-friendly approach. Other regional states have also signaled an interest in the project, these include: Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Paraguay, and Uruguay. In November 2008 when Venezuela imposed a $282 million tax bill on Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht. Odebrecht responded that it had already paid its full tax bill for the year and did not need to pay the new bill. Venezuela's Seniat tax authority gave Odebrecht 15 days to appeal. =Peru= In 2001, newly elected Peruvian President Alejandro Toledo's suspicion that the Chávez administration was protecting and hiding Vladimiro Montesinos provoked a major diplomatic confrontation between the two countries. The crisis started when Peru's Interior Minister Antonio Ketin Vidal blamed Venezuelan intelligence officers of disrupting a secret joint operation by Peruvian and US agents to capture former Peruvian intelligence chief Montesinos. The right-wing Venezuelan press reported the presence of Montesinos in Venezuelan territory months before the capture, although José Vicente Rangel, representing the position of the Venezuelan government, denied his presence and the rumors that suggested that Montesinos was inside Venezuela.Rangel promete extraditar a Montesinos. El Universal (5 January 2001). Accessed 1 July 2006. An April 2001 article by the journalist Patricia Poleo (for which she was awarded 2001's \\"King of Spain Journalism Award\\") described firsthand accounts of Montesinos' presence in Venezuela.'Si no publicamos las fotos no se desarrolla el caso'. El Universal (21 November 2001). Accessed 1 July 2006. Venezuelan security forces captured Montesinos in June of that year and later deported him to Peru to face charges of corruption, bribery and human rights violations. Further diplomatic disputes ensued as Venezuelan security forces claimed most of the credit for finding Montesinos while Peru claimed its own forces and US FBI agents deserved credit. Chávez withdrew his envoy to Peru in response to this affair, in part because he accused Peru of having undertaken security operations in Venezuela without previous approval.Taylor, Robert (Sept 2001).Venezuela: Montesinos' Capture. World Press Review (VOL. 48, No. 9). Accessed 1 July 2006. Gustavo Gorriti, advisor to President Toledo, said that President Chávez had no other option but to order the arrest of Montesinos following the pressure of a lead provided by the FBI after the capture of a former Venezuelan army officer who was withdrawing money from a bank in Miami, allegedly for Montesinos.'Lo entregaron para no quedar en evidencia'.

Between January and March 2006, Chávez commented on the candidates of the 2006 Peruvian Presidential election, openly backing Ollanta Humala (Union for Peru, nationalist-left) while referring to Alan García (APRA) as a \\"thief\\" and a \\"crook\\" and considering Lourdes Flores a \\"candidate of the oligarchy\\". His support in fact backfired when Alan García used it to attack Ollanta Humala; García won the election.BBC News. Peruvians elect Garcia president Accessed 5 October 2007.

Peru recalls Venezuela ambassador. Accessed 23 May 2006.BBC News.Venezuela recalls envoy to Peru. Accessed 23 May 2006. Garcia and Chávez reconciled their differences, ending the feud, and relations between Peru and Venezuela were restored. In 2007, normal diplomatic relations were restored, until April 2009 when Peru granted political asylum to Manuel Rosales, an opponent of Chávez and under charges of corruption. This in turn led Venezuela to again recall its diplomat from Peru. The dispute is ongoing. Peruvian authorities are currently investigating money transfers totaling $200.000 made from Venezuelan companies to the wife of Peruvian presidential candidate Ollanta Humala\\"EFE/ADN.es - La Fiscalía peruana investiga cuentas bancarias de esposa de Ollanta Humala\\" =Mexico= On 10 November 2005, Chávez referenced Mexican President Vicente Fox during a speech to supporters in Caracas, saying \\"the president of a people like the Mexicans lets himself become the puppy dog of the empire\\" for what he alleged was Fox's support of U.S. trade interests in his promotion of the newly stalled FTAA. Additionally, on 13 November 2005 episode of his weekly talk show, Aló Presidente, Chávez stated that the Mexican president was \\"bleeding from his wounds\\" and warned Fox not to \\"mess\\" with him, lest he \\"get stung.\\" Fox, upon hearing the remarks, expressed his outrage and threatened to recall the Mexican ambassador to Venezuela if the Chavez did not promptly issue an apology. However, Chávez simply recalled Venezuela's own ambassador to Mexico City, Vladimir Villegas. The Mexican ambassador to Caracas was recalled the following day. Although ties between the two countries have been strained, neither country will say that diplomatic ties have been indefinitely severed. Several groups in both Mexico and Venezuela are working to restore the diplomatic relationship between the two countries. In August 2007, each country reinstated her ambassador to the other, restoring full diplomatic relations. Chávez got into a dispute with Mexican President Vicente Fox over what Chávez alleged was Fox's support of US trade interests. The dispute resulted in a strained diplomatic relationship between the two countries. =Ecuador= As another leftist leader in Latin America, Rafael Correa, also had close ties with Venezuela and Chavez. The strongest show of support for the Ecuadorian leader was during the Andean crisis. At a time of escalating tensions with Colombia and Uribe's government due to an incursion on Ecudorean sovereignty, Chavez came out strongly in support of the former as he increased tensions on Colombia's other border with Venezuela to deflect the pressure on Ecuador, while supporting them every step of the way. = Bolivia = The strongest support for a Latin America was reserved for Evo Morales. In 2005 Morales, was said to be receiving funds from Chávez as Bolivia faced a series of strikes and blockades that threatened its stability. In 2006, Morales said he was uniting with Venezuela in a fight against \\"neoliberalism and imperialism\\". He agreed to work with Venezuela in sharing information and resources in agriculture, healthcare, education and energy. During the 2008 unrest in Bolivia, Chavez came out strongly in support of Morales by accusing the US of being behind the agitation in the provinces opposing Morales, where there are also secessionist demands. After Morales declared the U.S. ambassador, Philip Goldberg, persona non-grata for supporting the provinces and instigating violence, and the U.S. reciprocated. Chavez in turn ejected the U.S. ambassador in Caracas as well, and recalled the Venezuelan ambassador from Washington, D.C.. In doing so, Chavez said: \\"They're trying to do here what they were doing in Bolivia. That's enough ... from you, Yankees.\\" He added that Venezuela's ambassador to Washington, Bernardo Alvarez, would return to the U.S. \\"when there's a new government in the United States.\\" Venezuela donated close to U$80 million that Evo Morales distributed as part of his \\"Bolivia cambia, Evo cumple\\" program = Paraguay = As Paraguay's new leftist President Fernando Lugo was inaugurated, a change from 61 unbroken years of Colorado party rule, Chavez and Correa were together in the country to support another regional left leader. Chavez tried to woo the president with promises to fill Paraguay's imported oil gap. President Lugo has supported Venezuela's entry into Mercosur; however, the Colorado Party's influence in Paraguay's Congress and Senate retards this expansion. Stratfor also theorized that Chavez was trying to pry Lugo away from Brazil as the two were working on the Itaipu energy partnership. Doing this, they said, would weaken the other South American giant's, Brazil, efforts to extend its influence throughout Latin America.https://news.yahoo.com/s/mcb_southamerica/20080818/wl_mcb_southamerica/paraguayhugowooslugo Paraguay: Hugo woos Lugo Paraguay and Venezuela restarted negotiations on an unpaid debt of $250 million owed by Paraguayan oil company Petropar to its counterpart Petróleos de Venezuela after the Presidents of Paraguay and Venezuela met to deal with the financing. In September 2009 Paraguay's President Fernando Lugo revoked plans for US troops to hold joint military exercises and development projects. President Lugo referenced strong regional opposition from countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Ecuador to the expansion of US military bases in Colombia in his decision. President Hugo Chávez is an outspoken critic of US \\"imperialism\\", military activity and expansion in Latin America. =Uruguay= In August 2009 it was alleged that the Venezuelan government was purchasing thousands of books from a company belonging to the wife of the Uruguayan presidential candidate José Mujica, for nearly 100 times the actual price of the books \\"Armando Valladares, diariolasamericas.com - Descubren que Hugo Chávez está financiando la campaña del candidato oficialista en Uruguay\\" =Nicaragua= Hugo Chávez publicly supported Nicaraguan candidate Daniel Ortega and the left wing FSLN party in Nicaragua., and offered oil at preferential prices to town mayors belonging to the Sandinista Party. Relations with the U.S. The historically friendly diplomatic relationship between the Venezuela and the United States deteriorated steadily following the election of Hugo Chavez in Venezuela in 1999. When George W. Bush became President of the United States in 2001, relations between the United States and Venezuela grew even more tense. Relations between the two countries have further been degraded after Chavez accused the United States of being behind the 2002 military coup that briefly ousted him from power and hit an all-time low following the 2003 invasion of Iraq. While in office, President Chávez was highly critical of US economic and foreign policy and often referred to the United States derogatorily as \\"The Empire\\". He has referred to President George W. Bush as a devil, a drunk, a war criminal among others and has referred to President Obama as a \\"clown\\" and \\"shares the same stench as Bush\\" The relationship reached a diplomatic low point when Venezuela temporarily froze diplomatic relations with the US for several months after Hugo Chávez expelled the US ambassador to Venezuela in 2008 -09. Relations with European nations =Russia= Dmitry Medvedev and Hugo Chávez in Caracas, November 2008 Russian-Venezuelan relations were tightened during the reign of Chavez with energy and military cooperation. The latter led to joint exercises between the two militaries and a visit by a Russian naval ship to Venezuela. Furthermore, Venezuela also acquired billions of dollars of arms from Russia . Following Chavez's two visits to Moscow in July and September 2008, Russian Deputy Prime Minister Igor Sechin arrived in Venezuela to pave the way for a third meeting within five months between their two presidents. In November 2008, Venezuela and Russia discussed 46 potential cooperation agreements during an Intergovernmental Commission. Venezuelan Vice President Ramón Carrizales and Sechin reviewed a series of initiatives that Chavez and Russian President Dimitri Medvedev would sign later in the month. Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro added to aggressive foreign policy initiatives sought by Chavez in saying that \\"the unipolar world is collapsing and finishing in all aspects, and the alliance with Russia is part of that effort to build a multipolar world.\\" The two countries discussed the creation of a bi-national investment bank, the opening of a direct air route between Caracas and Moscow, the building of an aluminum plant, the construction of a gas platform off the Venezuelan coast, plans for automobile production, and Venezuela's acquisition of Russian planes and ships. While the two countries also reached agreements on the development of outer space and the use of nuclear energy. Maduro added that the two countries \\"will develop all what has to do with technology and satellite in the space\\", while still continuing to work at using nuclear energy with peaceful means to generate alternative energy. Venezuela sought to develop mines at its largest gold deposits with help from Russia. Venezuelan Mining Minister, Rodolfo Sanz, told a Russian delegation that a memorandum of understanding would be signed with the Russian-owned Rusoro to operate the Las Cristinas and Brisas mine projects with the Venezuelan government. The former, one of Latin America's largest gold projects, was under contract to Canada's Crystallex, which had waited in vain for years for an environmental license to start mining. The minister, however, said the government was taking control of the mine to start work in 2009. Further ties were in the offing when Chavez said an agreement for the Humberto Fernandez Moran Nuclear Facility would be signed upon Russian President Medvedev's visit to Venezuela accompanied by a Russian fleet of warships in mid to late-November 2008. Chavez also revealed that Russian nuclear technicians were already at work in Venezuela. As a Russian flotilla, including the nuclear-powered warship Peter the Great, was on its way to the Caribbean for naval exercises with Venezuela, analysts saw the move as a geopolitical response to US support for Georgia following the Russo-Georgian War. In September 2009, Venezuela became one of three nations worldwide to recognize South Ossetia and Abkhazia as countries independent of Georgia. Russia is one of the other two. Russian fighter jets have also been sold to Venezuela, while Caracas bought 100,000 Kalashnikov assault rifles for its military. However, the Russian Deputy Foreign Minister, Sergei Ryabkov downplayed the relevance of such moves \\"It looks like everyone has been accustomed for a long time to our warships being in naval bases and our warplanes in hangars, and thinking it will be like that forever\\", Ryabkov stated.http://www.voanews.com/english/2008-11-14-voa17.cfm On 27 July 2006, Hugo Chávez and Russian president Vladimir Putin announced an agreement in Moscow which enabled the import of military equipment from Russia to Venezuela.\\"Year in Review-Chronology\\" (pp 5-30) in Encyclopædia Britannica Almanac 2008. . In October 2010, Chavez visited Russia where he signed a deal to build Venezuela's first nuclear power plant. =Serbia= On 21 February 2008 Hugo Chávez said that Venezuela will not recognize an independent Kosovo, warning that the southeastern European nation's separation from Serbia could spark war in the Balkans and that it could end in a disaster. He said \\"This cannot be accepted. It's a very dangerous precedent for the entire world.\\".Venezuela's Chavez won't recognize independent Kosovo He compared the situation with separatists in Zulia State and Santa Cruz Department in Bolivia. He called Kosovo a region of Serbia which is recognized by history and geography. He attributed the decision of the Kosovars to an imperialist plan to continue weakening countries in the world. Chávez stated that Venezuela supports the position of Russia, that it has the same position as the People's Republic of China and many other countries and he also expressed satisfaction with the position of the government of Spain. He stated he cannot understand how there are countries that accepted Kosovo's move. He accused Washington on 24 March 2008 of trying to \\"weaken Russia\\" by supporting independence for Kosovo despite opposition by Serbia and Russia. He called Kosovo's new leader, Prime Minister Hashim Thaçi, a \\"terrorist\\" put in power by the US, and noted that the former rebel leader's nom de guerre was \\"The Snake.\\" Chavez had strongly opposed the NATO intervention in Kosovo in 1999 when he first became president. =Netherlands= In August 2007, Chávez came in conflict with the Netherlands concerning the Netherlands Antilles. Chávez gave a number of public speeches in which he said that the region ought to be 'freed from colonialism' and claimed that every piece of land within of the Venezuelan coast belongs to Venezuela. Since the Dutch Antilles are positioned off Venezuela, this was interpreted by some Dutch officials as a threat of invasion of Dutch sovereignty, and several political parties requested that the Dutch army be prepared for war, a VVD official referring to the Antilles as \\"the Dutch Falklands\\"Elsevier article while other parties dismissed Chávez' speeches as populism with no real intention of invading the Dutch Antilles.Elsevier article According to Radio Netherlands Worldwide, Chávez was not referring to the Netherlands Antilles or Aruba but to the Isla Aves, adding that \\"...there is nothing to worry about as far as the Netherlands Antilles are concerned, but that doesn't fit in with the US's publicity campaign. The media leave out all this kind of information and simply report that Venezuela wants to expand its borders and, in doing so, is intent on swallowing up the Leeward Islands.[...] The Hague knows there is no claim to Aruba or the Netherlands Antilles, and that President Chávez has not made such a claim in any speech\\". = United Kingdom = On 8 February 2006, the British Prime Minister Tony Blair answered a question asked by the MP Colin Burgon about the policy of the United Kingdom towards Venezuela, in the British House of Commons. Blair said: \\"It is rather important that the government of Venezuela realise that if they want to be respected members of the international community they should abide by the rules of the international community\\". Blair also said: \\"I also have to say with the greatest respect to the president of Venezuela that when he forms an alliance with Cuba I would prefer to see Cuba a proper functioning democracy\\".BBC News \\"Chavez rejects 'attack' by Blair\\" (9 February 2006). Retrieved 20 December 2007 President Chávez replied the following day that Mr. Blair disobeyed international rules when the UK invaded Iraq and called him \\"a pawn of imperialism\\" and \\"the main ally of Hitler (George Bush)\\" At the same time Hugo Chávez criticized Tony Blair for his alliance with the United States and the Iraq War he consolidated a strong partnership with the mayor of London Ken Livingstone.

The Pope presented Chávez with a letter detailing the concerns of the Holy See regarding the condition of the Church in Venezuela. Among the issues most important to the Pope were: *the freedom of the Holy See to nominate new bishops, *the preservation of a distinctive Catholic identity at the Church-run University of Santa Rosa in Lima, *the elimination of religious education from the school curriculum, *the introduction of public-health programs that undermined the right to life, *and the need for independence in the Catholic media. Chavez did offer his assurances that his government would work to ease the tensions that had characterized his relations with the Venezuelan bishops. Among his critics at home was Cardinal Rosalio Castillo Lara, the most outspoken prelate, referring to Chávez as a \\"paranoid dictator\\" who had crushed democracy in Venezuela. In the battle of words that followed, the President, in turn, referred to the critical bishops as \\"devils\\" and made a charge against the Catholic hierarchy that the latter were plotting against his government. In a more terse shift Chávez hit out at the Pope during the latter's trip to Brazil, where he said the Roman Catholic Church had purified the American Indians. This was the first direct confrontation with the head of the church, accusing the Pontiff of ignoring the \\"holocaust\\" that followed Christopher Columbus's 1492 landing in the Americas. His exact words were, \\"With all due respect your Holiness, apologize because there was a real genocide here and, if we were to deny it, we would be denying our very selves.\\" Furthermore, Chávez's words came only days after the Venezuelan media interpreted other comments from the Pope as singling out Chávez as a danger to Latin America when he warned of autocrats in the region.https://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSN1819661120070519 Chavez demands Pope apologize for Indian comments Relations with Asian and Middle Eastern nations =China= When Hugo Chávez came to power, trade with China had peaked under $200mn but since then it jumped to nearly $10bn. Chinese officials say that Venezuela has now become the biggest recipient of its investments in Latin America. Venezuela also embarked on a programme of cultural and scientific exchange with China. In 2008 the governments of Venezuela and the People's Republic of China launched their first joint space satellite, named Venesat-1. Venezuela's leader Hugo Chávez said the satellite would be a tool of integration for Latin America and the Caribbean regions by saying \\"This satellite is not for us but for the people of Latin America and the Caribbean. It is a further step towards independence\\", he said, adding that the project would break the mold of \\"technological illiteracy.\\"Venezuela launches first satellite with Chinese technology - Caribbean NetNews (Saturday, 1 November 2008) In September 2008, Chavez visited PR China where he declared himself to be a \\"Maoist\\" and touted what he said was Chinese support to counter U.S. domination of world affairs. He also got China to jointly build oil tankers and help Venezuela build a refinery to process heavy crude oil in Venezuela. He similarly hailed China's plans to launch a telecommunications satellite for Venezuela (Venesat-1) on 1 November 2008. While he also established military-technological ties with the acquisition of two squadrons (24) of Chinese-built Karakorum-8 trainer jets and ground radars, signalling a greater Chinese involvement in Latin America. Further trade agreements worth $12bn were signed in February 2009, and Venezuela's first cell phone factory, built with Chinese support, was inaugurated. In 2009, China entered into a partnership with Venezuela to launch a railway company in Venezuela which will be 40% controlled by the China Railways Engineering Corporation (CREC) and the remainder by Venezuela. Venezuela outlined the role of the venture as one which would link Venezuela's oil producing regions and agricultural farming areas Oil exports to China are set to increase substantially. In September 2008 Venezuela signed a series of energy co-operation deals with China with the President of Venezuela stating that oil exports could rise threefold by 2012, to one million barrels a day. In February 2009 Venezuela and China agreed to double their joint investment fund to $12 billion and signed agreements to boost co-operation which include increasing oil exports from Venezuela, China's fourth biggest oil provider. An oil refinery is planned be built in China to handle Venezuelan heavy crude from the Orinoco basin. \\"It is part of a strategic alliance\\" Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez said, after meeting the visiting Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping who stated that \\"our co-operation is highly beneficial\\". In September 2009 Venezuela announced a new $16bn deal with China to drill for oil in a joint venture with PDVSA to produce 450,000 barrels a day of extra heavy crude.

Mitchell (June 22, 1835December 8, 1905) was a controversial American lawyer and politician, who served as a Republican United States Senator from Oregon on three occasions between 1873 and 1905. He also served as State Senate President, did the initial legal work involved in the dispute that led to the landmark Supreme Court case of Pennoyer v. Neff, and later was involved with the Oregon land fraud scandal, for which he was indicted and convicted while a sitting U.S. Senator, one of only twelve sitting U.S. Senators ever indicted, and one of only five ever convicted.United States Senate History, Expulsion and CensureThis number includes U.S. Senator from Alaska Ted Stevens. Early life Mrs. John H. Mitchell He was born in Washington County, Pennsylvania, with the name John Mitchell Hipple. He moved with his parents to Butler County, Pennsylvania, at the age of two. He attended public schools during much of his childhood, but also attended some private schools including the Witherspoon Institute. As a young man he was a schoolteacher. He seduced a 15-year-old female student, and, due to the resulting scandal, was forced to marry her. Legal career In 1857, Mitchell stopped teaching and decided to become a lawyer. He built a successful law practice in Pennsylvania. However, in 1860, he decided to leave his community and family, and moved to California with a local schoolteacher with whom he was having an affair. After arriving in California, he abandoned her and moved to Portland, Oregon. It was then that he decided to change his name to John Hipple Mitchell, using his middle name as his last name, and attempted to start a completely new life in Oregon. Almost immediately, he started to become a successful lawyer and build political connections. Mitchell was not an intellectual man, but he was very ambitious and knew how to develop business and political friendships with important people. In 1867, he was hired as a professor at Willamette University School of Medicine to teach medical jurisprudence. Mitchell remained as professor for almost four years.Lanman, Charles. 1876. Biographical annals of the civil government of the United States, during its first century. From original and official sources. Washington: J. Anglim. p. 206. During his law practice in Oregon, Mitchell did some legal work for a client named Marcus Neff. Mitchell's dispute with Neff regarding some unpaid legal bills gave rise to the circumstances that led to the U.S. Supreme Court case of Pennoyer v. Neff. Political career Two years after arriving in Oregon, in 1862, he was elected to the Oregon State Senate.Oregon Legislative Assembly (2nd) 1862 Regular Session In 1864 he became President of the state Senate and served in that position until 1866.Oregon Legislative Assembly (3rd) 1864 Regular Session Because United States Senators were elected by the state legislatures during his lifetime, and that was the only office that Mitchell was to seek, this early position in the state Senate was the only popularly elected office that he would ever run for or win. Mitchell was an unsuccessful candidate for the United States Senate from Oregon in 1866, losing to Henry W. Corbett. He tried again in 1872 and this time won, taking office in 1873. He petitioned to officially change his name after he was elected.Query.nytimes.com On the topic of names, during Mitchell's second period of Senate service (from November 18, 1885, to March 3, 1897), he concurrently served alongside two other different individuals named \\"John Mitchell\\", from other states. From November 18, 1885, to March 3, 1887, Mitchell served alongside Sen. John I. Mitchell from Pennsylvania; and from March 4, 1893, to March 3, 1897, Mitchell served alongside Sen. John L. Mitchell from Wisconsin. By this time, he had married again, but had not divorced the woman he had married in Pennsylvania. His opponents tried to block him from becoming a senator by asking a Senate committee to expel him for what he had done in the past, charging him with bigamy, desertion and living under an assumed name. Though these charges were certainly true, the Senate Committee decided they were not relevant. Mitchell served in the Senate from 1873 to 1879, and was defeated for reelection. He ran for reelection to the Senate in 1882 but lost. In 1885, however, he was elected again to the Senate, and reelected in 1890. Mitchell sought reelection by the Oregon Legislature in 1897, but his candidacy proved to be highly divisive: the resulting scandal prevented the 19th Oregon Legislative Assembly from organizing and, consequently, left Oregon with a vacant U.S. Senate seat for nearly two years.Google Docs Joseph Simon was ultimately chosen for the seat. While not in the Senate, Mitchell practiced law. Mitchell's last term in the Senate began in 1901 and was to last until 1907, but Mitchell died before it expired. Mitchell was devoted to business interests and was against the populists and their political reforms. In the Senate, he was interested in transportation issues. He was chairman of the committee on railroads from 1877 to 1879 and from 1889 to 1893, and chairman of several committees related to coastlines and the ocean during his terms in the Senate. He was also chairman of the committee on claims from 1891 to 1893 and chairman of the committee of elections and privileges from 1895 to 1897.

It was discovered on 17 June 1909, by German astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory. The presumed S-type asteroid has a short rotation period of 4.9 hours and measures approximately in diameter. Possibly inspired by the asteroid's provisional designation \\"1909 HA\\", it was named for the biblical woman Hagar.  Orbit and classification  When applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements, Hagar is a core member of the Eunomia family (), a prominent family of stony S-type asteroids and the largest one in the intermediate main belt with more than 5,000 known members. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.2–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,579 days; semi-major axis of 2.65 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory on 28 June 1909, just eleven nights after prior to its official discovery observation by August Kopff at Heidelberg.  Naming  This minor planet was named after the biblical woman Hagar from the Book of Genesis. She was an Ancient Egyptian servant of Sarah and the mother of Abraham's firstborn, Ishmael. The asteroid's name may have been inspired by the two letters of its provisional designation, \\"1909 HA\\". It is also speculated that the name comes from a list created in 1913 by the Astronomisches Rechen-Institut (ARI) containing suggestions of female names from history and mythology for the naming of minor planets (AN 196, 137). At the time, the naming process was not well developed and the ARI feared inconsistencies and potential confusion. The list was sent to several German astronomers, including Kopff, with the invitation to name all of their made discoveries up to number 700.  Physical characteristics  Based on the overall spectral type of the Eunomia family, Hagar is possibly a common, stony S-type asteroid. However, observations by Pilcher (see below) found a V–R color index of , which rather suggest a low albedo of a carbonaceous C-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In August 2013, a rotational lightcurve of Hagar was obtained from nine nights of photometric observations by Frederick Pilcher at the Organ Mesa Observatory in Arizona. Analysis gave a well- defined, classically shaped bimodal lightcurve with a rotation period of () hours and a high brightness variation of magnitude (). At the same time, Alexander Kurtenkov at Sofia University, Bulgaria, obtained a concurring period of hours with an amplitude of magnitude (). In July 2017, French and Swiss astronomers René Roy and Raoul Behrend confirmed the period measuring a nearly identical rotation of () hours and an amplitude of magnitude (). = Poles = Two lightcurves, published in 2016, using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and other sources, gave a concurring sidereal period of () and () hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two spin axes of (93.0°, −71.0°) and (277.0°, −35.0°), as well as (56.0°, −78.0°) and (255.0°, −57.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β), respectively. = Diameter and albedo = American photometrist Frederick Pilcher also determined a diameter of kilometers based on a visual absolute magnitude of , and an albedo of 0.057 derived from its measured V–R color index (see above).

It was discovered on 5 November 1901, by the German astronomers Max Wolf and August Kopff at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. Nine years later, the body was rediscovered by August Kopff at its apparition in 1910.  Description  The S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.8–4.0 AU once every 6 years and 3 months (2,272 days). Its orbit is tilted by 26 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows an eccentricity of 0.17. Based on its orbital elements, it is a member of the Cybele family. Named after the 65 Cybele, the group consists of relatively low-eccentric asteroids, which have a semi-major axis around 3.4 AU, dwelling in-between the Hungaria and the outermost Hilda family of asteroids. According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the body has an albedo between 0.18 and 0.20, and several independent and concurring photometric light-curve analysis rendered a well-defined rotation period of 8.99 hours. The minor planet was named after Hippodamia, a figure from Greek mythology. It is believed the naming might have been influenced by the two letters of the provisional designation \\"1901 HD\\", a common practice of the discoverers. Hippodamia is the daughter of King Oenomaus of Pisa and wife of Pelops. She bribed Myrtilus, her father's charioteer, to remove a spoke from the royal chariot wheels so that Pelops could win her. Oenomaus had already defeated and killed 13 other suitors whom he had challenged to chariot races. After killing Oenomaus, Pelops murdered Myrtilus. These murders were primal sins, all paid for later by the many troubles of the house of Atreus.

He was born in Rostov-on-Don, Russian SFSR, in the family of a mining engineer. Glushkov graduated from Rostov State University in 1948, and in 1952 proposed solutions to Hilbert's fifth problem and defended his thesis in Moscow State University. In 1956 he began working with computers and worked in Kyiv as a Director of the Computational Center of the Academy of Science of Ukraine. In 1958 he became a member of the Communist Party. In 1962 Glushkov established the famous Institute of Cybernetics of the National Academy of Science of Ukraine and became its first Director. He made contributions to the theory of automata. He and his followers (Kapitonova, Letichevskiy and other) successfully applied that theory to enhance construction of computers. His book on that topic \\"Synthesis of Digital Automata\\" became well known. For that work, he was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 and elected as a Member of the Academy of Science of USSR. He greatly influenced many other fields of theoretical computer science (including the theory of programming and artificial intelligence) as well as its applications in the USSR. He published nearly 800 printed works. One of his great practical goals was the creation of the National Automated System for Computation and Information Processing (OGAS), consisting of a computer network to manage the allocation of resources and information among organizations in the national economy, which would represent a higher form of socialist planning than the extant centrally planned economy. This ambitious project was ahead of its time, first being proposed and modeled in 1962.

It was discovered on 5 March 1910, by German astronomer Joseph Helffrich at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory. The presumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.0 hours. It was named after Ernst Wolf, son of German astronomer and prolific discoverer of minor planets, Max Wolf.  Orbit and classification  Ernestina is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,773 days; semi-major axis of 2.87 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 12° with respect to the ecliptic. The asteroid was first observed as at Heidelberg Observatory on 28 November 1908. The body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation on 5 March 1910.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Ernst Wolf, son of German astronomer Max Wolf (1863–1932), who has discovered many asteroids at Heidelberg including some of the first near-Earth objects and Jupiter trojans. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  Ernestina is an assumed carbonaceous C-type asteroid. In a taxonomic classification based on MOVIS near-infrared colors, the asteroid's preliminary determined Cgx-type was ultimately rejected and its final class changed to \\"undefined\\" (U). MOVIS data has been obtained by the VISTA Hemisphere Survey using the VISTA telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile. = Rotation period = In October 2005, a rotational lightcurve of Ernestina was obtained from photometric observations by an international collaboration lead by Donald Pray at Carbuncle Hill Observatory .

It was discovered on 23 March 1908, by German astronomer Max Wolf at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, and named after King Nestor from Greek mythology. The carbonaceous Jovian asteroid belongs to the 20 largest Jupiter trojans and has a rotation period of 15.98 hours.  Orbit and classification  Nestor is a dark Jovian asteroid orbiting in the leading Greek camp at Jupiter's Lagrangian point, 60° ahead its orbit in a 1:1 resonance (see Trojans in astronomy). It is also a non-family asteroid in the Jovian background population. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 4.6–5.8 AU once every 11 years and 9 months (4,294 days; semi-major axis of 5.17 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.12 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. As no precoveries were taken, the body's observation arc begins with its official discovery observation at Heidelberg in March 1908.  Naming  This minor planet was named from Greek mythology after Nestor, the king of Pylos. He was an Argonaut and counselor to the Greeks at Troy. Nestor fought against the centaurs and participated in the hunt for the Calydonian Boar. The asteroid was named by the German Astronomische Gesellschaft during a meeting at Breslau in 1910.  Physical characteristics  In the Barucci classification, Nestor is classified as a carbonaceous C-type asteroid (C0), while in the Tholen taxonomy, its spectral type is ambiguous, closest to an X-type and somewhat similar to that of a C-type (XC). In the Lightcurve Data Base it is assumed to be a primitive P-type.

Based on this time period, a cross section with the minor and major occultation axes at kilometers was inferred. The quality rating is 1 (\\"no fit\\"). = Rotation period = In January 1988, a first rotational lightcurve of Nestor was obtained from photometric observations by MIT-astronomer Richard P. Binzel showing a rotation period of hours (). In August 1995, Italian astronomer Stefano Mottola observed the asteroid with the Bochum 0.61-metre Telescope at ESO's La Silla Observatory, Chile, and derived a period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude ().

History =Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services= In 1984, Hearst/ABC-Viacom Entertainment Services (HAVES) was formed from the merger of Daytime and Lifetime Medical Television to start and operate a new cable channel, Lifetime Television. Lifetime committed $25 million to produce talk show programming, but very little worked with the audience. So by the end of 1985, Lifetime was $16 million in debt. Lifetime added more original programming to diversify its audience while programming a medical block on Sunday with all the medical talk shows which attracted pharmaceutical advertisers bringing in 25% of the network's revenue. By 1986, the talk shows were canceled and the company was $36 million in debt. Lifetime instead refocused its programming towards women in 1987 and acquired second run syndicated programming and off-network shows. Beginning in the early 1990, Lifetime began producing multiple, original telefilms each year targeting the female audience. Over the next decade, the original movies boosted Lifetime TV's ratings, and successfully launched the \\"Television for Women\\" era and brand. In September 1991, HAVES launched Healthlink Television, which created health and wellness content, and provided the equipment to broadcast it into doctors' offices..(September 16, 1991 https://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/16/business/whittle-deal-for-healthlink.html Whittle Deal For Healthlink]. New York Times (The Associated Press).. Eventually, and to focus on its original content to support its women-centric brand, HAVES agreed to sell Healthlink TV to Whittle Communications. In October 1991, HAVES reorganized the company to have five group vice-presidents run the company so the CEO/President can focus on new programming acquisitions, the startup of new programming ventures, and to develop growth strategies; putting plans into motion that increased budgets for original content produced in New York and California by 50%.

In 1993, and to better utilize its existing NY studio facilities that independently operated at the Kaufman Astoria Studios (KAS) complex, \\"Lifetime Studios\\" was created as an anchor KAS tenant and as a stand-alone profit center for the company. The 100,000 square foot digital facility was intended to produce the network's NY-based original programming, as well as to provide studios, post-production, equipment and personnel for third party productions. During the next 12 years, under the aegis of Vice-President/General Manager Mitchell Brill, the studios and its production management and engineering team supported the production of thousands of hours of network content, and was simultaneously home to over 400 projects for an array of other global media companies. Among the many projects were long-running, award-winning children's television productions; PBS's \\"Where in the World is Carmen San Diego,\\" \\"Where in Time is Carmen San Diego,\\" and \\"Between the Lions,\\" Jim Henson Television's \\"Bear in the Big Blue House\\", and \\"Out of the Box\\" for the Disney Channel. Additionally, many music and entertainment programs originated from the studios, including; Top of the Pops for the BBC, MTV's Unplugged, A&E;'s \\"Live Upon Request,\\" and PBS's \\"Great Performances.\\" For 10 years, one studio was exclusively dedicated for Lifetime's morning block of talk, cooking and craft programming, including chef Bobby Flay's first show, Main Ingredient. In 1995, HAVES had ABC News produce a two-hour political special for Lifetime, and then a daily live news show that aired for two seasons. By 2000, entering the first dotcom era of emerging television and internet platforms, Lifetime Studios provided the facilities and technical expertise for some of the first interactive, cross-platform projects and companies, while also pushing to the forefront of the use of tapeless, server-based hardware and software for television production. Dubbed a \\"studio of the future\\", Lifetime Studios was an industry leader until operations ceased upon the expiration of its lease in 2005. =Lifetime Entertainment Services= Viacom sold its stake in April 1994 to Hearst and Cap Cities/ABC becoming at some point Lifetime Entertainment Services (LES). For 1996, LES committed $100 million towards original programming. In 1996, the channel's website was launched, Lifetimetv.com. With its recent involvement in sponsoring and programming women sports, the company started a sports division. Lifetime in fall 1998 spins off a new cable channel, Lifetime Movie Network. In November 1998, it was announced that CEO Douglas McCormick's contract would not be renewed when it was up at the end of the year. Although Lifetime staff members reportedly were \\"dumbfounded\\" because the network had been so financially successful during McCormick's tenure, board members wanted someone who would \\"bring more vision\\" to the company.

He joined the board of Venezuelan state-owned petroleum company PDVSA in 2002 and served as company president from 2004 to 2014. He also served as Venezuela's Minister of Energy from 2002 to 2014. He was the longest-serving cabinet member under President Hugo Chávez. In 2014, he briefly served as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and then subsequently served as Venezuela's Permanent Representative to the United Nations in New York. Ramirez was fired as UN representative by Venezuelan president Nicolas Maduro the evening of November 28, 2017. He confirmed he had \\"resigned\\" at the request of Maduro on December 4, 2017 Life and career Ramírez was appointed to lead the energy ministry in July 2002 by Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez. Ramirez had been the founding president of Venezuela's \\"Enagas\\", the national regulatory agency that was set up to be responsible for establishing the national plan for natural gas production and distribution. Ramírez, a mechanical engineer by his university education, has had wide- ranging experience in the design, development, coordination, and management of engineering projects for the Venezuelan petroleum industry. Hence, Ramírez was responsible for the design, development, and promotion of national policies for natural gas. Next, he was promoted to the status of Minister of Energy and Mines, and he faced the \\"oil sabotage\\" of late 2002 and early 2003. The Ministry of Energy and Mines became Ministry of Energy and Oil in January 2005, and became the Ministry for People's Power of Oil and Mining in 2012. On November 20, 2004, Ramírez was selected as the president of the company Petróleos de Venezuela, S.A. (PDVSA), a position that he has held concurrently with that of the Minister of Energy and Petroleum. Ramírez was moved to the post of Minister of Foreign Affairs on 2 September 2014. After a few months he was instead appointed as Permanent Representative to the United Nations on 26 December 2014. His appointment as Permanent Representative coincided with Venezuela taking a seat on the United Nations Security Council on 1 January 2015.Andrew Cawthorne, \\"Venezuela's Maduro moves foreign minister Ramirez to U.N.\\", Reuters, 26 December 2014.

He is best known for being the only pianist to have recorded the complete solo piano works of Franz Liszt, a project which included more than 300 premiere recordings. He has been described by The Guardian as \\"a master of a tradition of pianism in serious danger of dying out\\". Biography Howard was born in Melbourne the eldest of four children. His brother William is a cellist. Howard's ability to recall anything by ear, and perfect pitch, was first cited in Melbourne newspaper The Herald,The Herald, 11 August 1953 when he was 5 years old. At the age of 5, he performed for Fox Movietone News, and at the age of 9 on Australian national television. His mature debut as a pianist came at the age of 13, with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 2. He learned the oboe at an early age, and has even performed Mozart’s Oboe Concerto. He attended Monash University in Melbourne to study English, but by the end of his first year had been invited to lecture the post-graduate students on advanced counterpoint and theory. His post-graduate music studies were completed in Italy, where he studied with Guido Agosti. He has lived in London since 1972, preferring its climate to that of his native country; he has both Australian and British nationality. In 1987 Howard became an instructor at the Guildhall School of Music. He often gives masterclasses at the Royal College of Music and Royal Academy of Music. He frequently appears with promising student pianists to help further their careers. Examples are performances of Liszt's arrangement for two pianos of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony, with Coady Green; piano duets of Percy Grainger with Michael Brownlee-Walker; and conducting a performance of Shostakovich's First Piano Concerto in London's Wigmore Hall, and then again at the Royal Festival Hall for the Pearl Awards, with a 9-year old Chinese pianist as soloist. Howard is also frequently invited to sit on the juries of music competitions, such as the International Franz Liszt Piano Competition and the Royal Over-Seas League's annual music competition. He has a large repertoire of solo and chamber music, and more than 80 works with orchestra. He was a founding member of the now disbanded London Beethoven Trio, which gave regular performances for a number of years. Liszt project In 1986, to mark the centenary of Franz Liszt's death, Leslie Howard gave a series of ten Liszt recitals in London’s Wigmore Hall. By excluding Liszt's arrangements (fantasies and transcriptions) of other composers' works, and by selecting only the final versions of Liszt's original works for solo piano, Howard was able to represent Liszt's entire solo piano oeuvre in ten mammoth recital programmes. The founder and Managing Director of Hyperion Records was present at these recitals, and invited Howard to record for the label. All Liszt's versions of his piano music were included, including more than 300 premiere performances and recordings, and pieces unheard since Liszt's lifetime, and also all Liszt's arrangements of other composers' works. Four discs were given to Liszt's seventeen works for piano and orchestra, about half of which were premiere recordings made from unpublished manuscripts. The series ran at first to 94 full-length CDs, and earned Howard a place in The Guinness Book of Records for completion of the largest recording project ever undertaken by a solo recording artist (including pop artists). (The second volume of works for piano and orchestra included a bonus disc, not counted in the series numbering, which contained Ungarische Zigeunerweisen, a work for piano and orchestra by Liszt's favourite female student Sophie Menter: Liszt's exact involvement in the work is unknown, but he probably helped Menter in the composition of the solo part in the year before his death; the work was orchestrated seven years later by Menter's friend Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky, who conducted Menter in the premiere the following year). The last disc of the Liszt series was recorded in December 1998, and released on 22 October 1999, Liszt's birthday. Since completion of the project, three supplementary volumes have been released (the third of which is a double CD) as further Liszt manuscripts have come to light. The total number of CDs in the series is now therefore 99. A boxed set containing all 99 discs has been issued by Hyperion Records in 2011 in honor of the 200th anniversary of the birth of Liszt. Claims by other pianists to have recorded the complete piano works of Liszt are demonstrably incorrect. Such claims include those by France Clidat, whose Liszt recordings total just 28 CDs; and Gunnar Johansen, whose private home recordings number 53 LPs. A critic in the BBC Music Magazine declared: \\"Howard is, by general consensus, the finest living exponent of Liszt. (He has) a formidable intellectual grasp of the music, (and) his vastly superior performances continue to carry the day\\". As further indication of the status he enjoys among Liszt scholars, Howard was invited to perform at the inauguration of the Istituto Liszt in Bologna, Italy, of which he is an honorary member. He has been invited by the music publishers Edition Peters to edit the republication of some of their Liszt scores, correcting previous inaccuracies by a return to manuscript sources. He has also edited several volumes of Liszt Society Publications for Hardie Press and Editio Musica Budapest. With Michael Short he has published Ferenc Liszt – A List of his Musical Works (Rugginenti, 2004) and Ferenc Liszt – A Thematic Catalogue (Pendragon, 2005). He has a book in progress, The Music of Liszt (Yale University Press). =Honours related to his Liszt work= Leslie Howard has been the President of the British Liszt Society since the death of the previous president Louis Kentner in 1987, and has also been awarded the American Liszt Society's Medal of Honor. In 2000 he was awarded the Pro Cultura Hungarica Medal and Citation by the Hungarian Government, a rare honour for a non-Hungarian. He had previously received from the Hungarian government the Ferenc Liszt Medal of Honour, and he has also been awarded France's Grand Prix du Disque six times for his Liszt recordings—all presented to him by the President of Hungary. In 2004 he was decorated by the President of Hungary with the Medal of St. Stephen. Composer Howard is also active as a composer, and has written an opera (based on the Norse tale \\"Hreidar the Fool\\", with lyrics by Phillip Carrington and John Gough), a marimba concerto, chamber music, and many piano pieces. Howard's best known work is his \\"24 Classical Preludes for Piano, Op. 25\\", cycling through the major and minor keys, each written in the style of a different composer. Howard has recorded this work for Cavendish Music (Boosey & Hawkes). In 1997 Howard was commissioned by Gramophone magazine to compose and record a short piano piece (\\"Yuletide Pastorale\\") for its Christmas Competition: a CD was given away with the magazine, and readers were asked to state in which composer's style the piece was written, and to identify the seven well-known Christmas melodies concealed within it. Among Howard's arrangements and transcriptions are the final chorale movements of Bach's cantatas nos. 60 and 209, Glazunov's Second Concert Waltz, the aria \\"Ebben? Ne andrò lontana\\" from the opera La Wally by Alfredo Catalani, and a Concert Fantasy for Piano on themes from Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta Ruddigore. Editor In addition to his work editing and completing many of Liszt's scores, Howard has prepared for publication operas by Bellini, and the violin concertos of Paganini, including the first edition of Paganini's Violin Concerto No. 1 ever to be published in the correct key of E-flat (it usually played from an erroneous edition in D major, the orchestration of which is not by Paganini). Howard's facility in completing unfinished works has resulted in commissions as diverse as a new realisation of Bach's The Musical Offering, which he orchestrated and conducted in Finland in 1990, and completions of works by composers such as Mozart (String Quartet movement, K. 464a), Scriabin (Sonata in E-flat minor: end of the slow movement, and a 3-bar hole in the finale), Shostakovich (Piano Trio No. 1 in C minor, Op. 8: providing an alternative solution to that by Lyatoshinsky), and Tchaikovsky (Piano Sonata in F minor). In 2003, Boosey & Hawkes published Howard's \\"New Corrected Edition\\" of the 2-piano score of Rachmaninoff's 4th Piano Concerto (in collaboration with Robert Threlfall). Recordings In addition to his Liszt project, Leslie Howard's recordings include works by Balakirev, Bax, Beethoven, Borodin, Bridge, Rosemary Brown, Bruckner, Busoni, Chopin, Rebecca Helferich Clarke, Diabelli, Franck, Ignaz Friedman, Gade, Gershwin, Glazunov, Grainger, Granados, Grieg, Mendelssohn, Moszkowski, Mozart, Franz Xaver Mozart, Palmgren, Poulenc, Rachmaninoff, Raff, Reger, Rimsky-Korsakov, Rossini, Anton Rubinstein, Schumann, Sibelius, Smetana, Stravinsky, Tausig, Tchaikovsky, Vaughan Williams and Wagner.Leslie Howard Discography Other honours In addition to the Liszt-related honours mentioned above, Howard was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the Queen's Birthday Honours in 1999, \\"for service to the arts as a musicologist, composer, piano soloist and mentor to young musicians.\\" His appointment to the Order of Australia was terminated by the Governor-General in September 2012.Governor-General - Order of Australia in the General Division: Dr Leslie Howard, Government Gazette, S No. 155 of 2012, 3 October 2012. It has been suggested that this removal was connected to a 2007 traffic incident in the UK, which led to Howard being banned from driving for three years, given a six-month suspended jail sentence, and ordered to carry out 80 hours' unpaid work and to pay the equivalent of $2,100 costs. Howard has always maintained his innocence of the charges. In 2001, Howard was awarded a doctorate \\"honoris causa\\" by the University of Melbourne. In November 2009, Howard was invited by the Alkan Society in London to become their new president, a position which he now holds concurrently with his role as president of the Liszt Society.

Produced by De Laurentiis Entertainment Group and featuring special effects by Carlo Rambaldi, the film stars Linda Hamilton and Brian Kerwin. The film is a sequel to the 1976 remake of King Kong. Plot After being shot down from the World Trade Center, Kong is revealed to be still alive and is kept in a coma for about 10 years at the Atlantic Institute, under the care of surgeon Dr. Amy Franklin. In order to save Kong's life, Dr. Franklin must perform a heart transplant and give Kong a computer-monitored artificial heart. However, he has lost so much blood that a transfusion is badly needed, and to complicate matters, Franklin says there is no species of ape or other animal whose blood type matches Kong's. Enter Hank \\"Mitch\\" Mitchell, adventurer and Franklin's eventual love interest, who travels to Borneo (as he theorizes that Borneo and the island from the first film were once part of the same landmass) and captures a giant female ape who is dubbed \\"Lady Kong\\". Mitchell brings her to the institute to use her blood for King Kong's operation. The transfusion and the heart transplant are a success, but Kong escapes along with Lady Kong. Archie Nevitt, an insane army lieutenant colonel, is called in with his men to hunt down and kill the two apes. Lady Kong is captured alive by Nevitt's troops and imprisoned; Kong falls from a cliff and is presumed dead. However, as Franklin and Mitchell soon discover, Kong's artificial heart is beginning to give out, forcing them to attempt a jailbreak. They discover that Lady Kong is pregnant with Kong's offspring. The jailbreak is successful thanks to Kong, who has survived the fall and breaks his mate out. After being followed, attacked, and shot by the military, Kong kills Lt. Col Nevitt and dies slowly near a military base on a farm where Lady Kong gives birth to an infant son. Kong reaches out to touch his son just before dying. Having returned to Borneo, Lady Kong lives peacefully with her son in the jungle.

In 1977 he said there would \\"definitely\\" be a sequel. \\"Steve McQueen made a picture in which he died at the end, but they made another picture with Steve McQueen.

American Cinematographer; Hollywood Vol. 58, Iss. 1, (Jan 1977): 40-42. Progress of a sequel was complicated by the fact the 1976 film was considered a financial disappointment and there were ungoing legal uncertainties over who owned the rights to King Kong.'Kong' Battle Advances By ALJEAN HARMETZ. New York Times 27 Jan 1978: C20. A number of scripts had been written. \\"\\"They had King Kong in Russia and King Kong In outer space,\\" said writer Steve Pressfield. \\"Really, this is not an exaggeration. They even had one with little kids leading him around, saying things like 'Careful, Kong, don't step on that car.' It really was an embarrassment.\\" Pressfield and Ron Schusett pitched the idea that Kong has been on a giant respirator for years, and he was brought back to life with an artificial heard. According to Prescott, \\"Dino loved the whole idea of the artificial heart and said, 'That's brilliant. I've been wondering for five years how to bring him back to life in a way that people would accept.' Sure, it's campy, but It's outrageous enough that it really works.\\" John Guillermin had been hoping to direct a version of Tai Pan with Sean Connery but when that project was unable to be financed he moved on to King Kong Lives! The writers met with Guillermin and together devised the story about Kong getting an infusion from a female ape. \\"When we came up with the idea, Dino was very skeptical and didn't want to do it,\\" said Pressfield. \\"It's hard enough to accept that there's a King Kong but since he has been oround for 50 years he has become a pop cult hero. No one is going to believe a female ape.' I said, 'Dino, he hod to have a mother,' And he said, 'By God, you're right, 1 never thinka that. There con be a female,' and we went with it.\\" The film was announced in October 1985. It was part of a slate of films from De Laurentiis in association with Embassy that also included Blue Velvet.A DYLAN THOMAS SCRIPT, BUT, ALAS, LITTLE ELSE Ryan, Desmond. Philadelphia Inquirer 27 Oct 1985: I.2. Pressfield said \\"The whole thing is a love story with the two apes, but there's also a lot of action and an uplifting ending, although there are some elements of tragedy, as there were in the original. We even give a nod to women's lib with Lady Kong falling for the male scientist. Of course, this is before she meets the King.\\" Guillermin said later that making a sequel to King Kong was a bad idea. \\"Dino was striking out on all sorts of things at the time. It's really too bad [that he suffered a run of flops]. He was involved with some interesting projects.\\" Brian Kerwin said, \\"I knew that my name would be up there as the lead, but there was never any question that the star of the movie was the ape. Also, the 1976 movie had such low prestige and Jessica Lange was ridiculed, but then so was Christopher Reeve for Superman, and look at the subsequent success of those two. So, I don't worry about it. We tried to have fun when we were making the movie, without poking fun at it. It's an adult fairy tale and it has humor. If people think it's a silly piece of fluff and we're all jerks, then that's the way it goes. I hope it doesn't happen.\\"That's too big a woman for me,' actor says of female version Monkeying around with the Kong tale Yakir, Dan. The Globe and Mail 5 Dec 1986: D.3.

Reception =Box office= Despite its marketing campaign, King Kong Lives was a box office flop in the United States and Canada, grossing $4,711,220 during its theatrical run. According to one accoung \\"Besides the fact that audiences have noses for a stinker, King Kong Lives lacked an effective advertising campaign that sold its premise (Kong finds a mate), and the movie was sold as if it was just another B-movie retread. Which it was, but on an A budget.\\"The 12th Annual Grosses Gloss Thompson, Anne. Film Comment; New York Vol. 23, Iss. 2, (Mar 1987): 62-64,66-69. Overseas, the film was a success in the Soviet Union, where it sold tickets in 1988, becoming the top-grossing foreign film of the year and one of the top 15 highest-grossing foreign films of all time. At an average 1980s Soviet ticket price of , the film's ticket sales are equivalent to an estimated gross revenue of approximately руб (). The film sold a total of 54,831,200 tickets worldwide, including 1,231,200 tickets in North America. The film grossed an estimated total revenue of approximately worldwide. The financial failure of the movie - along with movies such as Tai Pain - led to the bankruptcy of De Laurentiis' company.De Laurentiis Group Files Chapter 11;Box Office Bombs Sink Movie Company: [FINAL Edition] Garties, George. The Washington Post 17 Aug 1988: f01. =Critical response= King Kong Lives was panned by critics. Rotten Tomatoes rated it a 0% based on 10 reviews, with an average rating of 1.55/10. On Metacritic the film has a weighted average score of 32 out of 100, based on 9 critics, indicating \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\". Roger Ebert gave the film only one out of four stars and stated, \\"The problem with everyone in King Kong Lives is that they're in a boring movie, and they know they're in a boring movie, and they just can't stir themselves to make an effort.\\" DEG sent a notice to Ebert and Gene Siskel notifying the two critics that they were allowed to show snippets of the film on TV in their native Chicago, but were forbidden to show the same snippets on the national scale. Siskel remarked \\"Obviously, they were scared [...] If you don't believe me or Roger, believe the film company, that, think about it, couldn't find a single scene that it wanted you to see.\\" The film was nominated for one Razzie Award, Worst Visual Effects. Actor Peter Goetz received a residual check of 12 cents from the film and decided to frame it as a tribute, never cashing it. The film is listed in Golden Raspberry Award founder John Wilson's book The Official Razzie Movie Guide as one of The 100 Most Enjoyably Bad Movies Ever Made. Home media King Kong Lives was released on VHS as King Kong 2. The film was later released on DVD with its original title. Video games Two official video games based on the film were developed and released only in Japan by Konami. They were titled King Kong 2: Ikari no Megaton Punch for the Famicom, and King Kong 2: Yomigaeru Densetsu for the MSX. The Famicom game totally discarded the human aspect of the story and players played as King Kong who has to travel around the globe fighting giant robots and certain military forces in order to save the female Kong. The game was designed as an action-adventure game with some science fiction concepts. The MSX version, on the other hand, plays from the perspective of Mitchell. This version is a role-playing game.

Career Ungerleider chose to perform under the name Oh Susanna rather than her given name as a means of keeping her private and professional lives separate. She initially wanted to be a somewhat theatrical performer. \\"I had this notion, okay I'm going to try and wear these vintage clothes and I play this old Stella guitar, which is like this mail order guitar that blues guys used to play,\\" said Ungerleider. She played her first show under the name Oh Susanna at the Railway Club in Vancouver in July 1995, and released her first independent recording, a seven-song EP, in 1997. At approximately this time, she decided to relocate to Toronto after attending Blue Rodeo's Stardust Picnic festival. In 1999, she released her full-length debut, Johnstown, and toured Canada and the United States with fellow musicians Veda Hille and Kinnie Starr, in what they dubbed the \\"Scrappy Bitches Tour\\". At the 19th Genie Awards in 1999, she won the Genie Award for Best Original Song, for her song \\"River Blue\\" from the film The Fishing Trip.\\"Genie Awards turn into the Don McKellar show\\". The Globe and Mail, November 13, 1998. She has since released six more albums, Sleepy Little Sailor (2001), Oh Susanna (2003), Short Stories (2007), Soon the Birds (2011), Namedropper (2014), and A Girl in Teen City (2017). Her recordings have featured guest musicians Luke Doucet, Justin Rutledge, Burke Carroll, Bazil Donovan and Jim Cuddy of Blue Rodeo, Ruth Moody of The Wailin' Jennys, and members of Weeping Tile. Of the inspiration for her songs, Ungerleider has said \\"A lot of that stuff comes from other people who have told me things. Some of its totally made up\\". She also says that her Western Canadian upbringing has inspired some of her lyrics. In 2012, Ungerleider announced that she intended to obtain Canadian citizenship. Plans to begin recording a new albumHowdy Folks, http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=e1521c2e10e1fdf5e8865ab57&id;=6331c50d67 were sidetracked in 2013 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer. However, she has undergone treatment for that, and released the album, Namedropper on October 7, 2014. Her next project \\"A Girl in Teen City\\" was released in 2017. The album is an autobiographical depiction of herself in her youth \\"in search of identity, \\"falling in love, getting drunk, having her heart broken, hanging out with friends in bedrooms, basements and parking lots, sneaking into shows in burnt out warehouses, watching the waves, walking home over bridges and railroad tracks in all that endless rain.\\"\\" In 2019, Ungerleider marked the 20th anniversary of her critically acclaimed debut album \\"Johnstown\\" by releasing a remastered version of the album on Record Store Day (April 13).

Dmytro Ivanovych Yavornytsky (), or Dmitry Ivanovich Yavornitsky (also known as Dmitry EvarnitskyDmitry Evarnitsky, ; November 6, 1855, Kharkov Governorate, Russian Empire – August 5, 1940, Dnipropetrovsk, Soviet Union) was a Russian Imperial and Ukrainian Soviet academician, historian, archeologist, ethnographer, folklorist, and lexicographer. Yavornytsky was a member of Moscow Archaeological Society (from 1885), of All-Russian Archaeological Society (from 1886) and an academician of Ukrainian Academy of Sciences (from 1929). He was recognised as one of the most prominent researchers of the Zaporozhian Cossacks from the time of the Cossack Hetmanate, and the author of their first general history. In recognition of his many contributions to the preservation of Zaporozhian Host history and culture, he is widely known in historiography as \\"the father of the Zaporozhians\\".  Education and career  Yavornitsky was born as Dmitry Evarnitsky. His father Ivan Yakimovich Evarnitsky (1827–1885) belonged to Russian Imperial nobility. Dmitry was educated at Kharkov University, Kazan, and Warsaw universities but his academic career was repeatedly interrupted for political reasons. Both as a student and later as a teacher, he was wrongly accused of \\"Ukrainian separatism\\" and dismissed from his position. In the 1890s, he was compelled to go to Russian Turkestan in order to find employment. In 1897, the Russian historian Vasily Klyuchevsky helped him to obtain a position as lecturer on the Zaporozhian Cossacks at Moscow University. In 1902, when he was offered a position as Director of the Yekaterinoslav Historical Museum in modern-day central Ukraine, he gladly accepted and remained there to the end of his life.  Historian  The Reply of the Zaporozhian Cossacks to Sultan Mehmed IV of Turkey (1880-91). Yavornytsky is pictured as the secretary in the centre of the painting. As a historian, Yavornytsky displayed a romantic-antiquarian approach to his subject and was a conscious follower of his predecessor Nikolay Kostomarov. He was an enthusiast who avidly sought out documents and material artifacts, as well as stories and the songs of the elderly, concerning the Zaporozhian Cossacks, and he wrote his histories on the basis of this material. He was a pioneer of Zaporozhian history and was the first to compile an extensive archive of materials on their entire history — from their origins, to their demise. He published much of this material in various collections, often at his own expense. Yavornytsky's major work was the History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks which was published in Russian in three volumes between 1892 and 1897. He planned, but never completed, a fourth volume. In this and in his other works, he portrayed the Zaporozhians as representatives of Ukrainian liberty. Later Ukrainian historians criticized him as being uncritical and unsystematic in his collection of source materials (Mykhailo Hrushevsky) and lacking an appreciation for Ukrainian statehood (Dmytro Doroshenko), but Yavornytsky wrote at a time when political circumstances and the Imperial Russian censors were extremely oppressive\\"Літописець Запорозької Січі - Минуло 150 років від дня народження Дмитра Яворницького\\", Ukraina Moloda, November 2011, and any synthesis of Ukrainian history which displayed an enthusiasm for the subject, let alone political independence, was highly suspect. His History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks was a pioneering work which did display such an enthusiasm.  Other scholarly interests  Yavornytsky was a pioneer in the fields of ethnography, folkloristics, and lexicography. He made numerous contributions to the historical geography of the Zaporozhian lands, and mapped in detail the Dnieper River rapids with the locations of the various Zaporozhian Siches, or fortified headquarters. He published a large collection of Ukrainian folksongs (1906; partly reprinted, 1990) as soon as the censor would permit it, contributed to Borys Hrinchenko's great Ukrainian dictionary, and after the Russian Revolution began publication of one of his own (1920). He increased the holdings of the Yekaterinoslav Museum from 5,000 to 80,000 items. Yavornytsky commissioned the best Ukrainian and Russian artists of his time (Opanas Slastion, Serhii Vasylkivsky, Nikolai Samokish, and Ilya Repin) to illustrate his various books, which were sometimes works of art in themselves. Especially notable in this regard is his From Ukrainian Antiquity (1900; reprinted in Ukrainian translation, 1991) which was lavishly illustrated in full colour and contained parallel texts in Russian and French so that it could be read abroad.  Legacy  During the repressions of the 1930s under Joseph Stalin, Yavornytsky was prevented from publishing and had to keep a very low profile. During the Holodomor (the Ukrainian famine of 1932–33), he felt compelled to give away artifacts from his collections to obtain food for starving local peasants and others. His death passed unnoticed both in the USSR and in the wider world. The Yekaterinoslav (today Dnipro) Museum was eventually renamed in his honour, and he was partially rehabilitated during the Nikita Khrushchev and Petro Shelest eras. Materials about him began to appear, and in the early 1970s a four volume collection of his works was prepared for publication. Political circumstances again prevented this from happening, but with the advent of the Perestroika reforms in the late 1980s, new materials began to appear and his major works were republished. At that time, his History of the Zaporozhian Cossacks was reprinted both in Russian and in Ukrainian (1990–91). The Ukrainian edition contains numerous additional illustrations. In 2004, the first volume of his Collected Works in Twenty Volumes was published. The first ten volumes of this collection will be dedicated to his historical, geographical, and archaeological works, while the second ten volumes will contain his works on folklore, ethnography, and language. Today, Yavornytsky is still widely revered as \\"the father of the Zaporozhians\\".

Repin consulted Yavornytsky during his work on the painting and made use of several artifacts from the historian's collection to use as accurate models.

In a career spanning almost 40 years, his smooth voice, dry humour and quick wit became his trademark. He remains the only television broadcaster to have spanned the entire duration of the AFL national competition, serving the Seven Network, Nine Network and Broadcom. He was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia (AM) in the 2019 Australia Day Honours. WAFL and VFL career Cometti played 40 matches for West Perth. His best year in the WAFL was 1968, when he kicked 63 goals playing for West Perth under Graham Farmer. In 1971, Cometti made the senior list at Footscray but, due to injuries and media commitments, was unable to make a mark and did not play a VFL senior match. On his return to Perth, he played with some success in the Sunday Football League. He initially played for Wanneroo before moving to Maddington as captain-coach, leading the club to four successive grand finals and winning premierships in 1974, 1975 and 1976. After hanging up his boots, he later coached Osborne Park and Kelmscott, winning a premiership in 1979. In 1982, Cometti was appointed coach of West Perth. The club finished third in his first year, but his tenure at West Perth was otherwise uneventful, and the team finished sixth in both 1983 and 1984. Other than a brief period as chairman of selectors for the Western Australia Australian rules football team, that was Cometti's last active involvement in club football. Commentary career =Early radio career (1968–1971)= He commenced his media career as radio announcer in Perth, Western Australia, in 1968 as a Top 40 disc jockey at radio station 6KY. Over the following five years he worked as an announcer on 6PM, 3DB (Melbourne) and 6PR, again in Perth. He broadcast his first football matcha state game between Western Australia and Victoria at Subiaco Ovalin 1971. Melbourne station 3KZ needed a caller and due to a quirk of fate Cometti volunteered to sit alongside Ian Major. =ABC (1972–1985)= He joined the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1972 where he concentrated exclusively on sport. He broadcast his first Test match in 1973 (at 23 the youngest in ABC history) and for the next 13 years broadcast Test Cricket alongside Alan McGilvray. =Seven Network (1986–2001)= In 1986 his move to the Seven Network coincided with the formation of the West Coast Eagles in the VFL. However, because of a bitter battle over television broadcast rights that excluded the Seven Network, Cometti broadcast the first season of the expanded VFL competition on independent broadcaster Broadcom in all states apart from Victoria. In 1988, when Seven regained the VFL television rights, Cometti immediately became the highest profile commentator of VFL/AFL matches (based in Western Australia where he presented the evening news sports segment). He stayed with Seven until 2001, as main sports anchor for Seven News in Perth, when they lost the rights to broadcast AFL matches. He has since been succeeded by Basil Zempilas, who reads the sport news on Seven News. In the late 1990s, he was among those to have been sent up by impersonator Andrew Startin on Live And Kicking. Actor Eric Bana was another to 'do' Cometti. He also commentated at the Summer Olympics swimming competitions in Barcelona 1992, Atlanta 1996 and Sydney 2000. Cometti has broadcast more Australian Olympic Gold Medals than any other commentator of the television era. =Nine Network (2002–2006)= Cometti switched to the Nine Network in 2002 and alongside Eddie McGuire, Dermott Brereton and Garry Lyon became the channel's leading Australian rules football caller. During those five years he was voted Australian Football Media Association (AFMA) television broadcaster of the year five times (career total 11). Cometti dominated Australia-wide newspaper polls for fan popularity. Occasionally while at Nine, he returned to cricket commentary and in 2003/04 called an Australia A game. As at Seven, he read the sports report on the weeknight National Nine News in Perth. =Return to Seven Network (2007–2016)= With the Seven Network regaining the rights to broadcast AFL games starting from 2007, Cometti re-signed with Seven to call games alongside Bruce McAvaney. Cometti also had a weekly segment on Seven News in Perth during the AFL season. =Later radio and newspaper career (2008–present)= Between 2008 and 2011 Cometti was the lead AFL caller on Saturday afternoons for 3AW, initially alongside Rex Hunt and later Brian Taylor. In 2009, he rejoined The West Australian newspaper to write a fortnightly column and weekly blogs. When Cometti revealed he would be joining Triple M in 2012, he was immediately removed from 3AW's lineup to call the 2011 AFL finals series and was replaced by Dwayne Russell, host of 3AW's Sports Today program and Fox Sports commentator.3AW to cut Cometti Cometti joined commentators James Brayshaw, Danny Frawley and Wayne Carey in calling each Saturday's match of the day for Triple M radio. He was voted the nation's top AFL radio caller in a national News Ltd newspaper poll in 2012. In August 2014, Cometti announced he would retire as an AFL commentator at the end of the 2016 season. His career was commemorated on-air during Seven's coverage of the 2016 AFL Grand Final, the last AFL match he called on television, accompanied by messages of congratulations from sponsor AAMI. He commentated 16 grand finals. In November 2016, however, it was announced that Cometti would continue to call matches for the Triple M radio network for games in Western Australia. It was also announced he would be part of the Seven Network's coverage of the WAFL.Dennis Cometti returns to Mix 94.5 Other work Cometti was featured on SBS in an episode in the first Australian series of Who Do You Think You Are?, where he traced his father's Italian heritage back to Italy and his mother's English heritage back to three convicts and a freeman. The show also revealed his great-great-grandmother (although never charged) may have been involved in the deaths of two of her husbands.Family history In 2012, he appeared in a television commercial series for Carlton Draught's Draught Pick iPhone app. =Video games= Cometti has been the voice-over commentator for the AFL video game series between 2004 and 2017. Awards and honours *2006 - Winner of the Alf Potter Award for that season's most outstanding media personality. *2014 - Voted Television Caller of the Year by the Australian Football Media Association for an unprecedented tenth time. 2016 - Retired with a total of eleven. *2017 - Was named the WA Sports Star of the Year at the West Australian of the Year awards *2018 - Perth Stadium's Media Centre named as the 'Dennis Cometti Media Centre' *2018 - Sport Australia Media Awards - Lifetime Achievement Award *2019 - Sport Australia Hall of Fame General Member *2020 - Australian Football Hall of Fame Inductee Cometti is a member of both the Melbourne Cricket Club (MCC) and AFMA Halls of Fame, as well as the Number 1 Ticket Holder for the Perth Wildcats.

It was written by Mildred Wirt Benson,WOSU Presents Ohioana Authors: The Works of Mildred Wirt Benson whom many readers and scholars consider the \\"truest\\" of the numerous Carolyn Keene ghostwriters, following an outline by Harriet Stratemeyer. The book was originally published by Grosset & Dunlap in 1937. An updated, revised, and largely different story was published under the same title in 1970.Editions of The Whispering Statue at WorldCat Plot summary - 1937 edition Nancy, Bess, and George encounter a troublesome stray terrier on their way to the opening festivities of a new park and recreation complex in River Heights. The terrier grabs the handbag of one of the guest speakers and loses it in a nearby pond. Nancy helps groundskeepers retrieve the handbag and uses the notes found inside to prompt the nervous speaker during her address. She also finds a mysterious personal ad in the handbag. In a casual observation, the \\"clubwoman,\\" a Mrs. Owen, tells Nancy about a statue on a deserted seaside estate. The statue, known as \\"The Whispering Girl,\\" bears an uncanny resemblance to Nancy. As it turns out, Nancy is bound for that very area with her father and her friends Bess and George. Reluctantly, Nancy decides to keep the terrier for a little while, dubbing him Togo (after a famous Alaskan husky, who in turn was named after a Japanese admiral). Togo follows her to the train station, and she has no choice but to bring him to Sea Cliff with her. On the train, the girls observe a strange elderly woman identified as a Miss Morse, and they suspect a man who has just approached the woman is trying to swindle her. Once in Sea Cliff, the girls hunt for the statue that resembles Nancy – and for Miss Morse, who has excited Nancy's curiosity and protectiveness. Further mysterious complications occur when Miss Morse acknowledges that she is being swindled but dismisses Nancy and when Nancy happens to overhear the crook from the train boasting about his conquest. There are several encounters with quirky but ultimately helpful older men. A seaplane accident leads Nancy to rescue a client of her father who is then linked both to Mrs. Owen and to the mysterious Miss Morse. In the long climactic sequence of the story, Nancy hides behind the statue and uses her voice to make the statue appear to speak to the con man from the train. She is also captured and tied up, and as she confronts one of the novel's many miscreants, the cliffside mansion falls into the ocean, necessitating another dramatic rescue. This edition of the novel is considered one of the most ragged, overpopulated, and coincidence-heavy of the series. It does, however, introduce the enduringly popular Togo, who becomes a mainstay in the series thereafter. The book is full of atypically harsh episodes, including a man who beats Togo cruelly, apparent elder and child abuse, and some saucy behavior by Nancy herself. It is perhaps the book most extensively overhauled for the reissue. 1970 revision Nancy is asked to solve a puzzling mystery, whereupon she encounters a second case. The first mystery concerns a valuable collection of rare books. Wealthy Mrs. Horace Merriam has commissioned a supposedly reputable art dealer to sell the collection, but she now suspects that the man is a swindler who is not giving Mrs. Merriam her portion of the proceeds. The second mystery involves the baffling theft of a beautiful marble statue, which is thought to \\"whisper,\\" and which bears an uncanny resemblance to Nancy. She becomes an undercover employee of the dealer, with the alias Debbie Lynbrook. The mystery becomes complicated when the returned marble statue is discovered to be fake. An attempted kidnapping, a nearly disastrous sailboat collision, and an encounter with a dishonest sculptor are just a few of the exciting challenges that Nancy is faced with as she gathers evidence against a clever ring of art thieves. Artwork The original 1937 cover art is by Russell H. Tandy, and shows Nancy crouched behind a statue, speaking to a man. Rudy Nappi illustrated the same scene for the 1962 picture cover edition, with updated clothing and hairstyles. Nappi also illustrated the cover of the 1970 edition, which is predominantly blue and white, featuring Nancy's profile behind an overlay of a statue.  Critique  Adult collectors of juvenile series often discuss artwork and plot elements in various fanzines and list serves. The original story introduces the recurring character of Nancy's dog Togo, who begins as a bull terrier (a popular breed in 1937) but is mentioned as a fox terrier or illustrated as a Scottish terrier in later appearances. The whispering element in the original version is simply Nancy fooling individuals; in a climactic moment, Nancy and Mrs. Conger are swept out to sea inside of a floating house, a somewhat strange and criticized element. In the revision, Nancy and her friends \\"hide\\" by kneeling inside three empty picture frames, a somewhat laughable idea. The statue whispers because of special holes drilled in the original that the wind could pass through when positioned in a garden. The artwork on the 1970 cover and interior text illustrations make the statue's resemblance to Nancy undeniable: they both wear their hair in a bobbed flip. Since the statue is a likeness of a long-dead woman, it is anachronistic that the statue sports a hairstyle not popularized until 1960 or later, a point of discussion among critics.

Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg, 2004, (eBook ) was a Hungarian aviation pioneer. He is known for creating an airship with a rigid envelope made entirely of metal. Schwarz died only months before the airship was flown. Some sources have claimed that Count Ferdinand Graf von Zeppelin purchased Schwarz's airship patent from his widow, a claim which has been disputed. He was the father of the opera and operetta soprano Vera Schwarz (1888–1964). Birth date and nationality Sources for his date of birth vary. The OCLC cites Rotem, Ẓ. giving it as 7 December 1850, while Brockhaus gives it as 20 December 1850 The OCLC, as well as Brockhaus, show Schwarz's place of birth as Zalaegerszeg, Hungary. Early life David Schwarz was born in Keszthely, Kingdom of Hungary, then part of the Austrian Empire, the son of Jewish. He was a timber merchant raised in Županja, but he spent most of his life in Zagreb. Although Schwarz had no special technical training, he became interested in technology and developed improvements for woodcutting machinery. First airship thoughts Schwarz first became interested in airships during the 1880s. This occurred while working away from home supervising the felling of some forest land. As the work took longer than planned, he had his wife send him books to while away the evenings. These included a mechanics textbook. Although Schwarz became excited, it is not certain that this inspired him to build his own airship. His lumber business suffered due to his obsession and, like other aviation pioneers, his project attracted mockery. Nevertheless, his wife Melanie supported him. Schwarz proposed aluminium, then a very new material, for construction. First airship in Russia Having worked out the design of an all-metal airship, Schwarz then offered his ideas to the Austro-Hungarian war minister. Some interest was shown, but the government was not ready to provide financial support. The Russian military attaché, a technically educated man, advised Schwarz to demonstrate his airship in St. Petersburg, where an airship using Schwarz's ideas was built in 1893. Schwarz, and later his widow, assumed that test flights would also be made there, but this did not happen. He began construction in late 1892, with the industrialist Carl Berg supplying the aluminium and necessary funding., citing and . Berg and Schwarz signed a contract 23 August 1893. Problems arose during gas-filling: on inflation, the framework collapsed. Schwarz apparently intended the metal skin to contain the gas directly without internal gas bags. The Russian engineer Kowanko pointed out that the lack of a ballonet would cause stresses on the skin during ascent and descent. Also, the skin was not airtight,Robinson 1973, pp. 6-7 The first airship's specifications were: * Power: four cylinder engine weighing producing at 480 rpm * Volume: * Empty weight: * Gross lift: * Ballast and fuel: * Equipment and three people: * Net lift: The circumstances of Schwarz's return are unclear; there were reports of a hasty departure from Russia. Second airship in Berlin In 1894, Carl Berg procured a contract to build an airship for the Royal Prussian government, referring to Schwarz as the originator of the idea. Berg already had experience working with the then novel aluminium, and was to later manufacture components for Zeppelin's first airship. With financial and technical help from Berg and his firm, the airship was designed and built. Construction began in 1895 at the Tempelhof field in Berlin. For a time the Prussian Airship Battalion placed its grounds and personnel at Schwarz's disposal., in the Prussian Airship Battalion's hangar. The components were produced in Carl Berg's Eveking Westphalia factory and, under the direction of Schwarz, assembled in Berlin.; . Accounts vary: George Whale wrote that the Berlin firm of Weisspfennig and Watzesch built it while Sean Dooley cites the U.S. airship historian Douglas Robinson as stating the work was done by Berg's engineers. A gondola, also of aluminium, was fixed to the framework. Attached to the gondola was a Daimler engine that drove aluminium propellers. One of the propellers was used to steer the craft. In June 1896 Carl Berg sent a card to his stepfather from Moscow apparently indicating that he had searched for information on Schwarz and became cynical of delays and was nearly convinced he had been swindled. Due to delays, the airship was first filled with gas and tested on 9 October 1896, but the results were not satisfactory because the hydrogen delivered by the Vereinigte Chemische Fabriken from Leopoldshall (part of Staßfurt) was not of the required purity and so did not provide enough lift. However, some sources claim that a test was performed on 8 October 1896. It was determined that gas with a density of 1.15 kg per cubic metre was needed. Gas of that quality could not be obtained for some time, and a test flight could not be made until November 1897, roughly ten months after Schwarz's death.Mentschl Ch. p. 429 German: Ein erster Füllungsversuch im Herbst brachte allerdings ein unbefriedigendes Ergebnis, da sich das verwendete Wasserstoffgas als ungeeignet erwies. S. erlebte den Flug seiner Erfindung nicht mehr. Erst im November 1897 fand Death and maiden flight David Schwarz' airship Schwarz did not live to see his airship fly. Between 1892 and 1896 he traveled frequently, which affected his health. Shortly before his death he received news that his airship was ready to be filled with gas. On 13 January 1897 he collapsed outside the \\"Zur Linde\\" restaurant in Vienna, and died minutes later from heart failure, aged 44. Historical sources speak of a blutsturz (a term meaning either hemoptysis or hematemesis). David Schwarz was buried in Zentralfriedhof, Vienna. Carl Berg required confirmation of Schwarz's death, suspecting he had fled to sell his secrets. Nevertheless, Berg resumed the work with Melanie, Schwarz's widow, and together with the Airship Battalion they completed the airship with the addition of a gas relief valve. This second airship had these specifications:Robinson 1973, p. 6 * Volume: * Length: 47.55 m (56 ft) * Diameter: 13.49 m (44 ft 3 in) * Engine: Daimler * Four propellers: one of 2.6 m (8 ft 6 in) diameter between the gongal and the envelope, two of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) diameter mounted on brackets either side of the envelope, and a fourth of 2 m (6 ft 7 in) diameter revolving in the horizontal plane mounted below the gondola to drive the craft up or down. * Envelope: 0.2 mm aluminium plates riveted to framework. A later structural analysis based on the drawings concluded that it was defective, with the skin taking most of the shear stresses: distortions of the skin can seen in a photo of the craft in flight. The second airship was tested with partial success at Tempelhof near Berlin, Germany, on 3 November 1897. Airship Battalion mechanic Ernst Jägels climbed into the gondola and lifted off at 3 p.m. However, the airship broke free of the ground crew, and because it rose quickly Jägels disengaged the vertical axis 'lift' propeller. At an altitude of about the drive belt slipped off the left propeller, resulting in the ship \\"...[turning] broadside to the wind, [and with the result that] the forward tether broke free.\\" As the ship rose to the drive belt slipped off the right propeller, the airship thus losing all propulsion. Jägels then opened the newly fitted gas release valve and landed safely, but the ship turned over and collapsed and was damaged beyond repair. Legacy About the time of the trial flight and for decades after, various accounts, sometimes conflicting or misleading, were written of the events. Later, Berg, as well as his son, would write negatively of his experiences with Schwarz. Some sources state that Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin purchased Schwarz's patent from his widow in 1898, while others claim that the count used the design. However, Hugo Eckener, who worked with Count Zeppelin, dismissed these claims: Cvi Rotem (1903–1980) wrote the only known biography, titled David Schwarz: Tragödie des Erfinders. Zur Geschichte des Luftschiffes. Rotem wrote that both Berg and Schwarz wished to keep their work secret. From 3 December 2000 to 20 April 2001 the Museen der Stadt Lüdenscheid held an exhibition which covered Berg, Schwarz and Zeppelin history from 1892 to 1932, with displays of documents, photographs and airship remnants.

It was discovered on 18 September 1906, by astronomer August Kopff at the Heidelberg Observatory in southwest Germany. The unusual K-type asteroid is the namesake of the small Brangäne family and has a rotation period of 12.3 hours. It was named after Brangaine, a character from the opera Tristan und Isolde by Richard Wagner.  Orbit and classification  Brangäne is the principal body of the stony Brangäne family, a small asteroid family of less than 200 known members. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.0–3.2 AU once every 4 years and 2 months (1,520 days; semi-major axis of 2.59 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.22 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the ecliptic.  Physical characteristics  In the SMASS classification, Brangäne is an uncommon K-type asteroid, while in the Tholen classification its spectral type is ambiguous, closest to a T-type and somewhat similar to that of an S- and D-type. = Rotation period = In November 2006, a rotational lightcurve of Brangäne was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomers Raymond Poncy and René Roy. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.20 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Brangäne measures between 28.15 and 36.18 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo between 0.096 and 0.13. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts an albedo of 0.1075 and a diameter of 36.96 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 10.2, from Petr Pravec's revised WISE-data.

It is the parent body of the Alauda family. Discovered in 1910 by German astronomer Joseph Helffrich at Heidelberg Observatory, it was named after the lark (alauda). Its small moon, named Pichi üñëm, was discovered in 2007.  Satellite  Alauda's satellite Pichi üñëm, provisionally known as , was discovered from observations using adaptive-optics imaging with the European Southern Observatory (ESO) 8-m Very Large Telescope (VLT) on Cerro Paranal, Chile.

It was named Pichi üñëm (Mapuche pronunciation: , approximately ), meaning \\"little bird\\" in the Mapuche language of Chile, the country from which the moon was discovered.  Orbital characteristics  Alauda has been identified as the largest member of the Alauda family, a dynamical family of bright carbonaceous asteroids with more than a thousand known members. Other members of this family include: 581 Tauntonia, 1101 Clematis, 1838 Ursa, 3139 Shantou, 3325 TARDIS, 4368 Pillmore, 5360 Rozhdestvenskij, 5815 Shinsengumi, and many others. Alauda's moon may be a result of the collision that created the asteroid family.  Physical characteristics  The discovery and tracking of Alauda's moon enabled Alauda's mass to be determined. The discoverers of the moon, Patricio Rojo and Jean-Luc Margot, estimated Alauda's mass to be (6.057 ± 0.36) kg and its density to be (1.57 ± 0.5) g/cm³. = Occultations = Alauda has been observed to occult stars on several occasions, providing important information on its size and shape. It produced occultations on 2001-07-12 and 2004-04-21. It may have occulted an apparent magnitude 9.5 star in the constellation of Gemini on 2009-10-17 at 08:18 UT.

Biography Voronoy was born in the village of Zhuravka, Pyriatyn, in the Poltava Governorate, which was a part of the Russian Empire at that time and is in Varva Raion, Chernihiv Oblast, Ukraine. From 1889, Voronoy studied at Saint Petersburg University, where he was a student of Andrey Markov. In 1894 he defended his master's thesis On algebraic integers depending on the roots of an equation of third degree. In the same year, Voronoy became a professor at the University of Warsaw, where he worked on continued fractions. In 1897, he defended his doctoral thesis On a generalisation of a continuous fraction. He was an Invited Speaker of the ICM in 1904 at Heidelberg. By the time he was only 40 years of age, Voronoy started feeling sick to his stomach. He wrote in his diary: > I am making great progress with the question under study [indefinite > quadratic forms]; however, at the same time my health is becoming worse and > worse. Yesterday I had for the first time a clear idea of the algorithm in > the theory of forms I am investigating, but also suffered a strong attack of > bilious colic which prevented me from working in the evening and from > sleeping the whole night. I am so afraid that the results of my enduring > efforts, obtained with such difficulty, will perish along with me. Following a severe gall bladder attack, Voronoy died on November 20, 1908. hryvnia coin commemorating the centenary of Voronoy Works Voronoy introduced the concept of what we today call Voronoi diagrams or tessellations. They are used in many areas of science, such as the analysis of spatially distributed data, having become an important topic in geophysics, meteorology, condensed matter physics, and Lie groups. These tessellations are widely used in many areas of computer graphics, from architecture to film making and video games. Blender 3D includes a Voronoi texture generator as one of its main sources of randomly generated images, that can be applied as textures for many different uses. Legacy Among his students was Wacław Sierpiński (Ph.D. at Jagiellonian University in 1906). Although he was not formally the doctoral advisor of Boris Delaunay (Ph.D. at Kiev University), his influence on the latter earns him the right to be considered so. In 2008, Ukraine released two-hryvnia coins commemorating the centenary of Voronoy's death.Национальный банк Украины ввел в оборот монету “Георгий Вороной” His son Yuri Voronoy became a prominent transplant surgeon who performed the world's first human-to-human kidney transplant in 1933.

The site's focal point is a concrete obelisk. In 1973, it was believed to be the fourth-tallest monument in the United States and the tallest concrete-cast one. with History of the monument Simon Bolivar Buckner, Sr., a Confederate general, first proposed the idea of a monument for Davis during a reunion of the Orphan Brigade of the Confederate Army in 1907. Construction began in 1917 but stopped in 1918 at a height of due to building material rationing during World War I. Construction resumed in January 1922 and was finished in 1924 at a cost of $200,000. The monument's base was set on limestone bedrock and limestone was quarried on the site for use in its construction. The concrete walls are thick at the base and taper to thick at the top. The monument was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. The obelisk was closed to the public from 1999 until May 2004 for renovations and construction of a new visitor center. At the top of the monument is an observation room with a window in each of the four walls. Originally, this room could only be reached by climbing stairs which went around the interior of the monument; an elevator, installed in 1929, now takes visitors to and from the observation room. Park details The Jefferson Davis State Historic Site is one of eleven historic sites in Kentucky which include small parks and are maintained by the Kentucky Department of Parks. The park covers and includes open and covered picnic areas and a playground. At the visitors' center museum, visitors can watch a video describing Davis' life and the construction of the monument. Guided elevator tours of the monument are available daily. The center sells books and memorabilia about Davis, the American Civil War, and the surrounding area, as well as Kentucky handcrafts. The park is open from May 1 until October 31.

Pathankot district shares an international border, on its west, with Pakistan. Pathankot was officially declared a district of the Punjab state on 27 July 2011. It was previously a Tehsil of Gurdaspur district, Punjab. Pathankot district is at the intersection of three of the northern states of India — Punjab, Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir. Due to its location, Pathankot serves as a travel hub for these three northerly states. Pathankot has a municipal corporation. Pathankot is the 6th most populous city of Punjab, after Ludhiana, Amritsar, Jalandhar, Patiala and Bhatinda. The city is divided into 50 wards. Situated in the picturesque foothills of Kangra and Dalhousie, with the river Chakki flowing close by, the city is often used as a rest-stop before heading into the mountains of Jammu and Kashmir, Dalhousie, Chamba, Kangra, Dharamshala, Mcleodganj, Jwalaji, Chintpurni and further into the Himalayas. Pathankot also serves as an education hub for the nearby areas of Jammu & Kashmir and Himachal Pradesh. Many rural students of these states come to Pathankot for education. History Pathankot is an ancient city and has historical significance. From various accounts; It may be believed that Audumbara was the name of it. Numerous coins of great antiquity found at Pathankot prove that it is one of the oldest sites in the Punjab (that has been divided after the partition in 1947). It must always have been a place of great significance as it is situated in the foot of the hills. Coin of Dharaghosha, king of the Audumbaras, in the Indo-Greek style, circa 100 BCE. Obv: Standing figure, probably of Vishvamitra, Kharoshthi legend, around: Mahadevasa Dharaghoshasa/Odumbarisa \\"Great Lord King Dharaghosha/Prince of Audumabara\\", across: Viçvamitra \\"Vishvamitra\\".

Anatoly Samoilenko was born in 1938 in the village of Potiivka, Radomyshl district, Zhytomyr region. In 1955, he entered the Geologic Department at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University. However, the extraordinary gift of Samoilenko for mathematics determined his destiny in its own way, and, instead of a known geologist, science got a prominent mathematician. In 1960, Samoilenko graduated from the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University with mathematics specialization. At the same time, his first scientific works were published. In 1963, after the graduation from the postgraduate courses at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR, Samoilenko defended his candidate-degree thesis \\"Application of Asymptotic Methods to the Investigation of Nonlinear Differential Equations with Irregular Right-Hand Side\\" and began his work at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR under the supervision of Academician Yu. A. Mitropolskiy. In few years of diligent research work, Samoilenko became one of the leading experts in the qualitative theory of differential equations. In 1967, based on the results of his research in the theory of multifrequency oscillations, he defended his doctoral-degree thesis \\"Some Problems of the Theory of Periodic and Quasiperiodic Systems\\", the official opponents of which were V. I. Arnold and D. V. Anosov. In 1965–1974, Samoilenko worked as a senior research fellow at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR and gave lectures at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University. In 1974, he obtained the professor degree. In 1978, he was elected to become a Corresponding Member of the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR. His monographN. N. Bogolyubov, Yu. A. Mitropol’skii, and A. M. Samoilenko, Method of Accelerated Convergence in Nonlinear Mechanics [in Russian], Naukova Dumka, Kiev (1969). brought him worldwide recognition. This monograph was written by Samoilenko together with his teachers, Academicians N. N. Bogolyubov and Mitropolskiy. Thirty six years later, Samoilenko reminisced, \\"In Kyiv, at the Institute of Mathematics, great scientists were my teachers... In many fields of science, they were 'trendsetters' on the scale of the Soviet Union. It is very important for a young scientist to belong to a serious scientific school. Probably, only in this case he has a chance to obtain results at the world level. The atmosphere of a good scientific school itself stimulates a young scientist to carry out his research work at the cutting edge of modern science. And if he suddenly opens a new direction in science, then his name immediately gains recognition\\".I. Bessmertnyi, \\"Scientists do not need freedom\\" [in Russian], Newspaper \\"2000\\", No. 5 (255), 04.02.2005, p. 5. http://2000.net.ua/is/101/255-c1.pdf, http://2000.net.ua/is/101/255-c5.pdf. In 1974–1987, Samoilenko headed the Chair of Integral and Differential Equations of the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv State University. These years were marked by especially high scientific activity of the chair. Based on results of the research in the theory of differential equations with delay performed at that time, the monographYu. A. Mitropol’skii, A. M. Samoilenko, and D. I. Martynyuk, Systems of Evolution Equations with Periodic and Quasiperiodic Coefficients [in Russian], Naukova Dumka, Kiev (1984). of Mitropolskiy, Samoilenko, and D. I. Martynyuk was published. At the same time, Samoilenko, together with his disciple M. O. Perestyuk, published the well-known monographA. M. Samoilenko and N. A. Perestyuk, Impulsive Differential Equations [in Russian], Vyshcha Shkola, Kiev (1987). devoted to the theory of impulsive differential equations. These monographs (especially their English translationsN. N. Bogoljubov, J. A. Mitropolskii, and A. M. Samoilenko, Method of Accelerated Convergence in Nonlinear Mechanics, Hindustan Publishing Corporation, Delhi (1976).A. M. Samoilenko and N. A.

Martinyuk, Systems of Evolution Equations with Periodic and Quasiperiodic Coefficients, Kluwer, Dordrecht (1992).) are frequently cited in scientific literature. Since 1987, Samoilenko has headed the Department of Ordinary Differential Equations at the Institute of Mathematics of the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian SSR (at present, the Department of Differential Equations and Theory of Oscillations at the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), and since 1988 he has been the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine. The beginning of this fruitful creative period was marked by the fundamental monographA. M. Samoilenko, Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Multifrequency Oscillations. Invariant Tori [in Russian], Moscow, Nauka (1987). devoted to the qualitative theory of invariant manifolds of dynamical systems. This monograph served as a foundation for the construction of the general perturbation theory of invariant tori of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus. The English versionA. M. Samoilenko, Elements of the Mathematical Theory of Multi-Frequency Oscillations, Kluwer, Dordrecht (1991). of this monograph is also well known. Three years later, the monographYu. A. Mitropol’skii, A. M. Samoilenko, and V. L. Kulik, Investigation of Dichotomy of Linear Systems of Differential Equations Using Lyapunov Functions [in Russian], Naukova Dumka, Kiev (1990). of Samoilenko (in coauthorship with Mitropol'skii and V. L. Kulyk) was published. In this monograph, in particular, the method of Lyapunov functions was used for the investigation of dichotomies in linear differential systems of the general form. The results of many-year investigations of constructive methods in the theory of boundary- valued problems for ordinary differential equations carried out by Samoilenko together with M. Ronto are presented in monographs.A. M. Samoilenko and N. I.

Constructive algorithms for finding solutions of boundary-value problems with different classes of multipoint boundary conditions were developed by Samoilenko, V. M. Laptyns'kyi, and K. Kenzhebaev; the obtained results are presented in monograph.A. M. Samoilenko, V. N. Laptinskii, and K. K. Kenzhebaev, Constructive Methods for the Investigation of Solutions of Periodic and Multipoint Boundary-Value Problems [in Russian], Institute of Mathematics, Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, Kiev (1999). Complex classes of resonance boundary-value problems whose linear pan cannot be described by Fredholm operators of index zero were investigated by Samoilenko, together with O. A. Boichuk and V. F. Zhuravlev, in monographs.A. A. Boichuk, V. F. Zhuravlev, and A. M.

Teplinskii, Countable Systems of Differential Equations, VSP, Utrecht (2003). of Samoilenko and Yu. V. Teplins'kyi is devoted to the theory of countable systems of ordinary differential equations. The monographs A. M. Samoilenko and R. I. Petryshyn, Multifrequency Oscillations of Nonlinear Systems [in Ukrainian], Institute of Mathematics, Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, Kyiv (1998).A. M. Samoilenko and R. I. Petryshyn, Mathematical Aspects of the Theory of Nonlinear Oscillations [in Ukrainian], Institute of Mathematics, Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences, Kyiv (2004). of Samoilenko and R. I. Petryshyn cover a broad class of qualitative problems in the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems on a torus. At present, Samoilenko is the author of about 400 scientific works, including 30 monographs and 15 textbooks, most of which have been translated into foreign languages. His monographs made an important contribution to mathematical science and education. According to MathSciNet, the scientific papers of Samoilenko were cited 336 times by 208 authors. The scientific interests of Samoilenko cover a broad range of important problems in the qualitative theory of differential equations, nonlinear mechanics, and the theory of nonlinear oscillations. His deep results in the theory of multifrequency oscillations, perturbation theory of toroidal manifolds, asymptotic methods of nonlinear mechanics, theory of impulsive systems, theory of differential equations with delay, and theory of boundary-value problems were highly appreciated in Ukraine and abroad. Academician Samoilenko is the founder of a scientific school in the theory of multifrequency oscillations and theory of impulsive systems recognized by the international mathematical community. His successful many-year guidance of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences furthers the rapid development of mathematics in the Ukraine and the continuation of the best traditions of the world-known Bogolyubov – Krylov – Mitropolskiy Kyiv scientific school. The worldwide recognition of Samoilenko's mathematical results is illustrated by notions well known in the mathematical literature such as the Samoilenko numerical-analytic method and the Samoilenko – Green function (the kernel of an integral operator related to the problem of an invariant torus of a dynamical system). Samoilenko gives much attention to training scientists of the highest qualification. For many years, he had given lectures at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University and the \\"Kyiv Polytechnic Institute\\" National Technical University and guided the scientific work of postgraduate and doctoral students. Despite the extremely busy schedule of his work as the Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Ukrainian National Academy of Sciences for about 20 last years (since 2006, he has also been the Academician-Secretary of the Department of Mathematics at the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine), Samoilenko finds time for organizational and public activities. In particular, Samoilenko is the President of the \\"Foundation for Support of the Development of Mathematical Sciences\\" All-Ukrainian charity organization. Many young talents from the \\"small homeland\\" of Samoilenko (Malynshchyna) are grateful to him for founding and heading the charity foundation for support of the development of gifted children and youth. Samoilenko found and taught many nonordinary scientists. He created an international scientific school in differential equations. Among his disciples, there are 33 doctors and 82 candidates of physical and mathematical sciences, who are now researchers of prestigious scientific institutions, professors, heads of chairs, deans, and rectors (scientific researchers, pedagogs, and administrators of various levels). For example, Samoilenko's alma mater (the Department of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Shevchenko Kyiv National University) has been headed for many years by his disciples (Professors M. O. Perestyuk and I. O. Parasyuk). Among other well-known scientists belonging to Samoilenko's mathematical school, one may mention Professor Kenzhebaev, the rector of the Zhubanov Aktobe University, one of the most reputable universities in Kazakhstan, and Academician M. Ilolov, the President of the Tajik Academy of Sciences. Samoilenko is a member of the Ukrainian Mathematical Society, the American Mathematical Society, and the editorial boards of numerous Ukrainian and foreign mathematical journals, among which there are Differential Equations, Reports of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, In the world of mathematics, Nonlinear Mathematical Physics, Memoirs on Differential Equations and Mathematical Physics, and Miskolc Mathematical Notes.The official site of the Miskolc Mathematical Notes http://mat76.mat.uni-miskolc.hu/~mnotes/author_card.php?author_id=17 .

The music often draws heavily on the tradition of garage/punk/rock'n roll/raw-blues-music from the 1950s and 1960s, hence references to the \\"Medway Delta\\".http://drownedinsound.com/releases/15940/reviews/4141942 Records have been released on Big Beat, Media Burn and other small indie labels, as well as Childish's own Hangman Records and Hangman's Daughter, and latterly Damaged Goods Records.http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/kent/hi/people_and_places/music/newsid_8280000/8280988.stm There has also been an accompanying, though not so well known, poetry scene, started by The Medway Poets in the late 1970s; Childish was a member of this group. There is also a crossover into art with the Stuckists art group.

It was discovered by German astronomer Joseph Helffrich at the Heidelberg Observatory on 9 October 1910. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Cgh) has a rotation period of 22.0 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after the bird genus Hirundo, commonly known as swallows.  Orbit and classification  Orbit of (2000-2020) Hirundo is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 6 months (1,647 days; semi-major axis of 2.73 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.19 and an inclination of 14° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory on 16 October 1910, or six nights after its official discovery observation by Joseph Helffrich at Heidelberg.  Naming  This minor planet was named after bird genus Hirundo, a group of passerines in the family Hirundinidae (swallows and martins). \\"Hirundo\\" is Latin word for swallow. They are found all over the world with the exception of New Zealand and the polar regions. Known for their graceful flight and regular migrations, swallows feature a short bill with a wide gape, small weak feet, and typically a deeply forked tail. They feed on insects caught on the wing. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  In both the Bus–Binzel (SMASS-II) and the Bus–DeMeo classification, Hirundo is a carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Cgh). = Rotation period and poles = In September 2000, a rotational lightcurve of Hirundo was obtained from photometric observations by American Brian Warner at the Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a high brightness variation of magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape (). During the same opposition, Bill Holliday measures a period of () and an amplitude of () magnitude at his River Oaks Observatory in New Braunfels, Texas (). Further observations by René Roy (2011), Patrice Le Guen (2018), and Anaël Wünsche and Raoul Behrend (2020) determined a period of (), () and () with an amplitude of (), () and () magnitude, respectively (). Two lightcurves, published in 2016, using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and other sources, gave a concurring period of () and () hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two spin axes of (92°, 66°) and (244°, 54°), as well as (91°, 70°) and (250°, 45°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β), respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Hirundo measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0853 and a diameter of 28.70 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11. The WISE-team also published two alternative mean-diameters of () and () with a corresponding albedos of () and ().

He played for the St Kilda Football Club from 2003 to 2012, then with Essendon from 2013 to 2018. He was the captain of Essendon during the 2016 season. He is the second cousin of Hugh Goddard who currently plays for the Carlton Football Club. Early life Goddard was raised in Traralgon, Victoria, and later attended Caulfield Grammar School as a boarder. He was an accomplished sportsman, co-captaining the school's First XVIII football team and co-captaining the First XI cricket team as a batsman and pace bowler. AFL career =St Kilda: 2003–2012= A lifelong Carlton supporter, it seemed destined that Goddard would fulfill his boyhood dream of playing for the Blues when Carlton finished last in the 2002 AFL season and indicated they would take Goddard with the first pick of the 2002 National Draft. However, an investigation into salary cap breaches stripped Carlton of the #1 pick, which was elevated to St Kilda, who ultimately took him. \\"It was pretty deflating, to be honest. But at that age you don't get a choice of where you go, so I was just grateful to get an opportunity anywhere.\\" He debuted in the following season while completing his Victorian Certificate of Education as a Year 12 student at Caulfield Grammar School. He played in the 2004 Wizard Home Loans Cup winning side – the club's second AFL pre-season competition win. After being selected with the number 1 pick, he received a lot of criticism in his early years. During a round 7 clash against the Sydney Swans in 2007, Goddard ruptured his ACL after falling heavily onto it, which resulted in Goddard missing the remainder of the season. He would return to play in round 3, 2008 and produced a solid form for the rest of the year. Despite interest from other clubs trying to recruit him, he signed a contract to stay with the Saints until 2010. After a strong first few rounds of the 2009 season, Goddard was noted as one of the best players in the league and was seen as an early favourite for the Brownlow Medal. Although generally considered a defender/midfielder, during a round 3 match against West Coast in 2009, he was positioned in the forward line and kicked four goals in the first quarter, the most he had ever kicked in a single game until that time. Although he didn't kick another goal for the game, he did gain 28 disposals in a best on field performance. Goddard averaged 27.2 possessions per game in 24 matches in 2009 and was selected in the 2009 All-Australian Team and finished as the runner-up for the Trevor Barker Award.Riewoldt wins historic fifth medal St Kilda finished first on the ladder after the home and away season and won their third minor premiership. They qualified for the 2009 AFL Grand Final, where they were defeated by the Geelong Cats by 12 points. He averaged a career-high 28.7 possessions in 25 games (including four finals matches). He was voted in the All-Australian Team, finished third in the Trevor Barker Award and received 14 votes in the 2010 Brownlow Medal going into the night as the favourite to win. In the drawn 2010 AFL Grand Final, Goddard finished second in the voting for the Norm Smith Medal, with seven votes and his teammate Lenny Hayes won it with 13 votes. He is also remembered for taking a memorable high mark in the last quarter, and kicking a goal which put the Saints in front (before Collingwood came back to draw the game and defeat the Saints in the resultant replay). At the conclusion of the season, he signed on until the end of the 2012 season. On 1 October 2012, Goddard signed with Essendon and became the first big name to use the AFL's new free-agency period which debuted in 2012. Goddard had refused to sign a new three-year deal all season and instead opted to sign with the Bombers, who offered him higher pay and a four-year contract. Goddard was formally offered the deal by Essendon at 11am on 1 October, with St Kilda allowed 72-hours in which to make a counter offer.http://www.afl.com.au/tabid/208/default.aspx?newsid=148889 However, the Saints decided by the end of the day that they were not willing to match the offer, therefore allowing Goddard to join the Bombers. In making a formal statement of the decision, St Kilda head of football, Chris Pelchen, stipulated that the club had made a significant offer to Goddard \\"that was relative to both his position and other players within the team. While we are disappointed at his decision to leave the Saints, we are absolutely committed to our ‘team first’ philosophy in relation to player contracts.\\"http://www.saints.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/5315/newsid/148945/default.aspx St Kilda's senior coach, Scott Watters, further elaborated on the reasons St Kilda chose not to counter the Bombers' offer: \\"As far as the offer that was put forward to Brendon, it would've put him in the top two highest paid players at our football club\\", Watters said. \\"The reason (for Goddard leaving) is money. It's that simple.\\" St Kilda was said to have offered \\"significantly more\\" than $500,000 a year to Goddard. =Essendon: 2013–2018= He joined Essendon with aspirations of winning a premiership, but found himself walking into one of the biggest controversies in Australian sporting history. Goddard took on the responsibility of being a leader and speaking to the media where his new teammates were not allowed to speak. Goddard's first season at Essendon was capped off when he won the first best and fairest award of his career.Rise and shine He played every game for the season, mainly through the midfield, averaging 26 disposals and kicking 18 goals, his best season tally since 2010. His leadership continued to be valued on and off the field and his maturity and experience in big games proved invaluable to the young list. In 2014, Goddard once again maintained his form on the field, whilst again being a voice for his teammates in the media. He was important in Essendon's loss to the North Melbourne Football Club and finished third in the W. S. Crichton Medal. In January 2016, Goddard was named as Essendon's captain, replacing the suspended Jobe Watson. Mark Baguley was named as vice-captain. In August 2018, Essendon opted not to offer Goddard a contract for the 2019 season.

It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory on 30 July 1911. The stony S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 15.6 hours and measures approximately in diameter. It was named after the city of Berkeley, California, where the discoverer's colleague Armin Otto Leuschner (1868–1953) was the director of the local observatory.  Orbit and classification  Berkeley is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.6–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 9 months (1,722 days; semi-major axis of 2.81 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.09 and an inclination of 8° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins with its first observation at Heidelberg on 16 July 1906, five years prior to its official discovery observation by Johann Palisa at Vienna.  Naming  According to Alexander Schnell, this minor planet was named by the discoverer after the U.S. city of Berkeley in California, where American astronomer and colleague Armin Otto Leuschner (1868–1953) was a long-time director at the Leuschner Observatory (then called Students' Observatory). Known for his books Celestial Mechanics and The Minor Planets of the Hecuba Group, Leuschner worked on the orbit determination of 719 Albert, which was originally discovered by Palisa in 1911 but remained a lost asteroid until 2000. The naming citation was not mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955. Palisa also named asteroid 718 Erida after Leuschner's daughter. The lunar crater Leuschner and asteroid 1361 Leuschneria, discovered by Eugène Delporte in 1935, were later named directly after the American astronomer.  Physical characteristics  In both the Tholen and SMASS classification, Berkeley is a common, stony S-type asteroid. It is also an S-type in the Bus–DeMeo classification, while in the Tholen- and SMASS-like taxonomic variants of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), this asteroid is a K-type and Sq-subtype which transitions to the uncommon Q-type, respectively. = Rotation period = In May 2009, a rotational lightcurve of Berkeley was obtained from photometric observations by American amateur astronomer Joe Garlitz at his Elgin Observatory in Oregon. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). Lower rated lightcurves obtained by Claes-Ingvar Lagerkvist in 1977, and by David Romeuf in 2018, gave a divergent period of larger than and with an amplitude of larger than and magnitude, respectively (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the Japanese Akari satellite, Berkeley measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively.

She audited courses at the Stroganov School of Applied Art in 1907 but was not accepted for admission. After this, she trained in the private studio of Konstantin Yuon. From 1907 to 1910, fellow drawing and painting students studying in these private studios included Lyubov Popova, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Aleksei Kruchenykh, and Serge Charchoune. By 1910, she was fairly well-known in Russian art circles. She moved to St. Petersburg and joined Soyuz Molodyozhi (Union of Youth) in 1911; two of her canvases, Nature- morte and The Cafe debuted at the second Soyuz Molodyozhi exhibition in April 1911. She would submit her canvases to their group exhibitions until 1913. Razanova briefly studied at the art school of Elizabeta Zvantseva, which housed many Russian art nouveau artists. In January 1912, her two works, Portrait and Still-Life, appeared at the next Soyuz Molodyozhi exhibition in January 1912. This exhibition was the first appearance of the Donkey's Tail, a Moscow-based artistic group led by Mikhail Larionov. Rozanova later traveled to Moscow to try to establish joint projects between the two groups; these negotiations proved to be unsuccessful. Soyuz Molodyozhi disbanded in 1914. From 1913 to 1914, Cubo-Futurist ideas appeared in her work, but she appears to have been especially inspired by Futurism. Of all of the Russian Cubo- Futurists, Rozanova's work most closely upholds the ideals of Italian Futurism. During Filippo Tommaso Marinetti's visit to Russia in 1914, he was very impressed with her work. Rozanova later exhibited four works in the First Free International Futurist Exhibition in Rome, which took place from April 13 to May 25, 1914. Other Russian artists featured in the exhibition included Alexander Archipenko, Nikolai Kulbin, and Aleksandra Ekster. She met the poet Aleksei Kruchenykh in 1912; he then introduced her to the Russian Futurist concept of zaum (translated as \\"beyonsence\\") poetry, a language with no fixed meanings and constant neologisms, which is probably used by birds. Rozanova would write her own poetry in that style, and also illustrated books of zaum poetry, two examples being A Little Duck's Nest of Bad Words and Explodity (both 1913). With Kruchenykh, she would invent a new kind of Futurist book, the samopismo, where the illustrations and the text would he literally connected. Rozanova, Boguslavkaya, and Malevich at the alt= Rozanova joined the avant-garde group Supremus that year, which was led by former fellow Cubo- Futurist Kazimir Malevich. By this time, her paintings has developed from the influences of Cubism and Futurism, and took an original departure into pure abstraction, where the composition is organized by the visual weight and relationship of color. In the same year she exhibited at the 0,10 Exhibition, and, together with other Suprematist artists (Kazimir Malevich, Aleksandra Ekster, Nina Genke, Liubov Popova, Ksenia Boguslavskaya, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Ivan Kliun, Ivan Puni and others) worked at the Verbovka Village Folk Centre. From 1917 to 1918 she created a series of non-objective paintings which she called tsv'etopis'. Her Non-objective composition, 1918 also known as Green stripe anticipates the flat picture plane and poetic nuancing of color of some Abstract Expressionists. =Death and legacy= She died of diphtheria at the age of 32 in Moscow in 1918, following a cold she contracted while working on preparations for the first anniversary of the October Revolution. Her work is now in the collections of the Museum of Modern Art, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Carnegie Museum of Art, and the Harvard Art Museums.  Major Works  * In a Cafe (c.1911-1912) - One of Rozanova's earlier pieces, In a Cafe, depicts a man and a woman on opposing sides of a table, the man with his head in his hand and the women with a drink in hers. Rozanova makes use of vibrant colors and thick lines to create a piece with aspects of French avant-garde and Russian Neo-Primitivistic art. * The Factory and the Bridge (c. 1913) - The Factory and the Bridge was included in the First Free International Futurist Exhibition in 1914. This piece had inspiration from the Italian Futurism movement, and its bright colors gives it an expressionist tone. * Metronome (c. 1914) - A piece from the middle of her career, Metronome was displayed at the Last Futurist Exhibition 0,10 in Petrograd in 1915. * Playing Cards series (1915) - One of her most famous works, the series represents the height of her artistic career. It consists of portraits of her peers set as designs for playing cards.

Chet Parker was born the son of a blacksmith. His first instruments were the snare drum and the fife. He also learned to play the fiddle (his father was a fiddler) and to read music. He was introduced to the hammered dulcimer by a friend, who loaned him one, in 1900. Chet made his own dulcimer in 1904, and continued to play it the rest of his life. Parker was a key figure in introducing the hammered dulcimer to the folk revival of the 1960s. He appeared at the Newport Folk Festival in 1964, playing Golden Slippers and the Temperance Reel. These performances were included on the record Traditional Music at Newport 1964: Part 1 (Vanguard Records VRS-9182). This appearance in Newport is often credited with starting the revival of interest in the hammered dulcimer. Players Guy Carawan and Sam Rizzetta are among those who have said that Parker was the first person they heard play the hammered dulcimer. In turn, Carawan would later influence younger players such as Malcolm Dalglish and John McCutcheon. Later, Parker's playing was recorded by Patrick Murphy of Kalamazoo, Michigan, and issued as The Hammer Dulcimer Played By Chet Parker by Folkways Records (Folkways FA2381) in 1966. Parker continued to appear at festivals for the next several years, including the 1969 Smithsonian Festival of American Folklife and the 1970 Kalamazoo Folk Festival.  References  # Paul M.

Splendeurs et misères des courtisanes forms part of Balzac's La Comédie humaine. Plot summary Lucien de Rubempré and \\"Abbé Herrera\\" (Vautrin) have made a pact, in which Lucien will arrive at success in Paris if he agrees to follow Vautrin's instructions on how to do so. Esther van Gobseck throws a wrench into Vautrin's best-laid plans, however, because Lucien falls in love with her and she with him. Instead of forcing Lucien to abandon her, he allows Lucien this secret affair, but also makes good use of it. For four years, Esther remains locked away in a house in Paris, taking walks only at night. One night, however, the Baron de Nucingen spots her and falls deeply in love with her. When Vautrin realizes that Nucingen's obsession is with Esther, he decides to use her powers to help advance Lucien. The plan is the following: Vautrin and Lucien are 60,000 francs in debt because of the lifestyle that Lucien has had to maintain. They also need one million francs to buy the old Rubempré land back, so that Lucien can marry Clotilde, the rich but ugly daughter of the Grandlieus. Esther will be the tool they use to get as much money as possible out of the impossibly rich Nucingen. Things don't work out as smoothly as Vautrin would have liked, however, because Esther commits suicide after giving herself to Nucingen for the first and only time (after making him wait for months). Since the police have already been suspicious of Vautrin and Lucien, they arrest the two on suspicion of murder over the suicide. This turn of events is particularly tragic because it turns out that only hours before, Esther had actually inherited a huge amount of money from an estranged family member. If only she had held on, she could have married Lucien herself. Lucien, ever the poet, doesn't do well in prison. Although Vautrin actually manages to fool his interrogators into believing that he might be Carlos Herrera, a priest on a secret mission for the Spanish king, Lucien succumbs to the wiles of his interviewer. He tells his interrogator everything, including Vautrin's true identity. Afterwards he regrets what he has done and hangs himself in his cell. His suicide, like Esther's, is badly timed. In an effort not to compromise the high society ladies who were involved with him, the justices had arranged to let Lucien go. But when he kills himself, things get more sticky and the maneuverings more desperate. It turns out that Vautrin possesses the very compromising letters sent by these women to Lucien, and he uses them to negotiate his release. He also manages to save and help several of his accomplices along the way, helping them to avoid a death sentence or abject poverty. At the end of the novel, Vautrin actually becomes a member of the police force before retiring in 1845. The nobility that was so fearful for its reputation moves on to other affairs.

It was discovered on 5 April 1913, by Russian astronomer Sergey Belyavsky at the Simeiz Observatory on the Crimean peninsula. The elongated S-type asteroid has a rotation period of 5.9 hours. It was named after Russian amateur astronomer Nikolai Maltsov (S. I. Maltsov) who founded the discovering Simeïs Observatory in 1900.  Orbit and classification  Located in the region of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids, Malzovia is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the inner main-belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,228 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 5° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at the German Heidelberg Observatory on 30 April 1913, or 25 days after its official discovery observation at Simeiz Observatory.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Russian amateur astronomer Nikolai Sergeevich Maltsov (S. I. Malzov) who founded the discovering Simeiz Observatory, which he later donated to the Pulkovo Observatory in 1911. Malzov was a close friend of Sergey Belyavsky and of Oskar Backlund, after whom asteroid 856 Backlunda was named. After World War I, Malzov lived at Menton, on the French Riviera near Italy. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen and Bus–Binzel SMASS classification, Malzovia is a common, stony S-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In February 2020, a rotational lightcurve of Malzovia was obtained from photometric observations by French amateur astronomer René Roy. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of () hours with a high brightness variation of magnitude, indicative of its elongated shape (). Alternative period determinations by Julian Oey and Frederick Pilcher in May 2014 gave very similar results of () and () hours, respectively, both with an amplitude of 0.30 magnitude (). = Poles = Published in 2018, thermophysical modeling of Malzovia from thermal data obtained from the Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) gave a sidereal period of () and two spin axes at (53.0°, 37.0°) and (242.0°, 46.0°) in ecliptic coordinates (λ, β). Previously, two lightcurves published in 2016, using modeled photometric data from the Lowell Photometric Database (LPD) and other sources, gave a period of () and hours, respectively. Each modeled lightcurve also determined two poles at (53.0°, 37.0°) and (242.0°, 46.0°), as well as (55.0°, 46.0°) and (246.0°, 55.0°), respectively. = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's WISE telescope, Malzovia measures () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 and calculates a diameter of 12.98 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.6. The WISE team also published several alternative mean-diameters of (), () and (), with a corresponding albedo of (), () and ().

Set in a science-fictional space colony compound, the game follows a female mercenary fighting against berserk robots. It was directed by Shinji Mikami. To avoid similarities with Devil May Cry and Resident Evil, the game designers emphasized defensive and rhythmic maneuvers, and a \\"delicate\\" \\"feminine\\" game world. The game was developed on a tight schedule in an attempt to offset Capcom's poor fiscal year. However, it received mixed reviews and failed commercially. Several critics found the game repetitive and unintuitive. They were divided on its gameplay mechanics: some disliked its controls—specifically the inability to move and shoot simultaneously—while others compared it favorably to golden age arcade games. Mikami repurposed ideas from P.N.03 for the game Vanquish. Gameplay and plot A game screen featuring Vanessa Z. Schneider fighting an enemy. The player controls Vanessa Z. Schneider, a freelance mercenary working on colonized planets. She is contracted by a mysterious client to destroy Computerized Armament Management System (CAMS) robots that have gone berserk. Robots of this type had been responsible for killing Vanessa's parents. To combat the CAMS, Vanessa wears \\"Aegis suits\\", powered exoskeletons that allow her to fire energy beams from her palms and to perform powerful attacks called \\"energy drives\\". It depletes the energy meter, grants temporary invulnerability to Vanessa and damages multiple enemies. At checkpoints, the player uses points earned from defeated robots to purchase Aegis suits, suit upgrades and energy drives. The player may play \\"trial missions\\" (randomly generated levels) between missions to score extra points. The CAMS robots attack in set patterns, and their next moves are indicated by visual and aural cues. The player avoids these attacks via evasive spins, rolls and other maneuvers. Vanessa cannot move while attacking, and so the player must often use the environment as cover. Defeated enemies sometimes drop items that replenish health and energy or that trigger a combo timer, which multiplies the points earned from enemies destroyed consecutively. Each mission takes place in a series of rooms that contain a fixed number of enemies and may include a boss robot. At the end of a mission, the player receives a score based on the number of rooms explored and enemies destroyed. Late in the game, Vanessa discovers a clone of herself in a CAMS facility but is forced to abandon her when the building's self-destruct sequence is initiated. After destroying the CAMS central core, Vanessa encounters a digital projection of the client, whose appearance is identical to her own. She speculates that she is a clone of the client, but the client counters that none of their memories may be real. Vanessa debates whether to continue her work as a mercenary. Development In November 2002, Capcom announced the Capcom Five, a group of video games developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and overseen by Resident Evil creator Shinji Mikami. Among these titles was P.N.03, directed by Mikami. Capcom conceived the Capcom Five to bring new intellectual property to the industry, which the company viewed at the time as stagnant. According to Hiroyuki Kobayashi, the P.N.03 team's goal was to make a game both \\"fun to watch and fun to play\\". The team focused on the game's audiovisuals, action and speed, and they tried to balance the \\"tension experienced on the battlefield and the exhilaration of taking out the enemies\\". Mikami wanted P.N.03 to evoke the same feelings as classic Nintendo games. While the staff felt the background graphics were important, they prioritized excitement in the game world. During the planning stage, P.N.03 was originally a wargame referred to as the \\"robot war game\\". Five days into development, the staff created a preliminary demonstration of the graphics. Mikami was unsatisfied with this prototype and decided to rework the project as a third-person shooting game. The director wanted to name the game Jaguar to reflect Vanessa's cat-like agility. However, other staff members disliked the name: some claimed that it failed to describe the game, while others thought that White Jaguar was a better title. Mikami chose P.N.03 as a hint to the game's plot. Early versions of P.N.03 highlighted shooting gameplay and featured the protagonist with a gun, which was removed due to time constraints. Early coverage of P.N.03 by GameSpot and IGN highlighted the game's acrobatics and shooting. P.N.03s gameplay was initially similar to that of Devil May Cry: Vanessa attacked with two pistols and performed acrobatic moves like Dante. Feeling that it resembled Devil May Cry too closely, Mikami altered the game to reward players for performing defensive moves. Mikami wanted Vanessa to use guns, but the developers couldn't complete the animated graphics for weapons in time for release. The guns were replaced with energy bolts fired from the character. In an effort to meet yearly sales goals, Capcom developed P.N.03 quickly and released it in March 2003. Many of Capcom's releases for the year had underperformed. Viewtiful Joe, another Capcom Five title, was delayed into the next fiscal year to decrease the possible sales that had to be offset. After leaving Capcom, Mikami later incorporated ideas he intended for P.N.03 into the 2010 game Vanquish. Kobayashi aimed to avoid conventions established in Resident Evil, such as that series' dark, masculine world. With P.N.03, Kobayashi wanted to portray a \\"white\\" world with \\"feminine, delicate lines\\". To that end, the staff applied a minimalist approach to the visuals, used \\"fine drawn lines\\", and emphasized \\"visibility and creativity\\" in the game world. To maintain the game's \\"delicate image\\", the developers tried to make the visuals easy to view and understand. The team crafted the gameplay to avoid \\"button mashing\\"; instead, players were meant to observe enemy attack patterns and think before acting. Mechanical designer Shou Sakai tried to craft \\"things that would stick in [the player's] mind\\". Because of the tight development schedule, 3D models had to be created immediately after their designs were completed. Sakai described the lack of time as the \\"toughest part\\" of the process. Mikami was indifferent to the main character's gender. During the early creation process, he left the decision to his staff, who ultimately chose a female character. Because P.N.03 takes place in a space colony, Mikami wanted Vanessa's country of origin to be ambiguous. To that end, she was given a combination of French, German, and English names. Vanessa's movements were animated freehand, without motion capture technology. The designers posed Vanessa crouched on her hands and knees to resemble a jaguar, as an homage to the Jaguar title. The staff integrated rhythmic motions to her maneuvers to emulate dancing and to make her appear stylish. Kobayashi wanted Vanessa to be a \\"cool and sexy mercenary with a tough exterior that hides her dark past.\\" In retrospect, he was proud of the character's style and movements.  Release  The Capcom Five were first announced as games exclusive to the Nintendo GameCube; however, Capcom later ported most of the titles to other consoles. At the end of 2002, the company confirmed that the game would be released in 2003 on GameCube. In January 2003, the company slated the game for a March release in Japan, but retracted the exclusivity announcement. At a press conference prior to the 2003 Electronic Entertainment Expo, however, Capcom reaffirmed that P.N.03 would be available only for the GameCube. In the end, P.N.03 was the only Capcom Five title to remain exclusive to the system. P.N.03 was the first of the Capcom Five to be released. Before the game's debut in Japan, Capcom distributed playable demos to stores and released screenshots to the media. Upon the game's release, Capcom shipped 25,000 copies to Japanese retailers. Under 11,000 units were sold, which made the game Japan's 26th best-selling title during the last week of March 2003. These low sales failed to help Capcom meet its yearly sales goals. The North American localization was announced in July 2003. Few aspects of the game were changed for the North American market. Capcom advertised a free T-shirt as a pre-order incentive in North America. Promotional sunglasses modeled after Vanessa's were also released. Reception P.N.03 failed commercially and received mixed reviews, with scores of 64% and 63 on review aggregate websites GameRankings and Metacritic, respectively. Electronic Gaming Monthlys three reviewers characterized the game as shallow, repetitive and devoid of plot and character development. Mark MacDonald of the magazine criticized Vanessa's inability to move and shoot at the same time. By contrast, the reviewer for Edge wrote, \\"P.N.03 may be rather short and its premise simple, but grace under fire has rarely been done better.\\" The writer favorably compared its gameplay to that of Space Invaders, in that the game \\"rewards skill above all else and mastery brings huge satisfaction\\". The reviewer cited Vanessa as one of the game's high points. In a 2009 retrospective review, the Edge magazine staff echoed its previous praise of P.N.03 but acknowledged the game's awkward control mechanics. The staff commented that Vanessa's potentially fluid movement is difficult to execute, but that the challenge of mastering the control scheme is part of the game's charm. GamePros Mike Weigand called the game \\"a long, intense, thumb- busting shooter that tests trigger fingers and patience levels.\\" He found the environments and enemies repetitive, but he cited \\"strong aesthetics\\" and \\"a slick reward system\\" as redemptive features. Weigand summarized that, while the game lacks depth, it may be recommended to \\"those who crave a shoot-em-up with old-school inflections\\". Paul Byrnes of GMR found P.N.03 to be a \\"boring and repetitive\\" missed opportunity. He felt that it lacked flow, thanks in large part to Vanessa's \\"clumsily staccato\\" movements and inability to move and shoot simultaneously. Game Informers Andrew Reiner wrote that P.N.03s setting, animations and protagonist give it an \\"undeniable allure\\" of freshness and originality. However, he disliked the game's control system and wrote that \\"blowing away robots gets old rather quickly\\". Reiner called P.N.03s length, which he estimated to be four hours, its \\"most disappointing aspect\\". Greg Kasavin of GameSpot wrote that \\"you'll almost certainly be unimpressed with the repetitive and cumbersome action at the heart of [P.N.03].\\" He disliked the game's separation into brief, discrete sections; and, while he saw the game's design as a reference to that of older games, he found that P.N.03 lacked the \\"extremely precise controls and smooth, colorful graphics\\" of the titles that inspired it. Kasavin summarized it as \\"a short, uninspired game that's yet another would-be imitator of Capcom's own Devil May Cry.\\" Matt Casamassina of IGN wrote that players will \\"want to like\\" the game, but that its \\"design flaws and sloppy execution\\" are impossible to overlook. He found it to be shallow and repetitive, and he wrote that its fast pace and \\"unresponsive control setup\\" combine to place the game \\"at war with itself.\\" However, he believed that P.N.03 is \\"not a disaster—merely a disappointment\\", and that it sits \\"solidly in average country.\\" In a 2012 retrospective from Eurogamer, Chris Schilling called the game the outcast of Shinji Mikami's work, criticizing its plot and calling its control scheme its \\"biggest obstacle\\". He later added \\"if at times its appeal can be hard to pin down, that doesn't mean it should be so easily forgotten\\", mentioning the satisfaction of beating the bosses in the game.

He collaborates frequently with Abdominal on the album Music For the Mature B-Boy and with Abdominal and fellow Canadian rapper D-Sisive on the second full album If You Can't Join 'Em… Beat 'Em, as well as with Akil and Chali 2na from Jurassic 5.  Career  As a youth, Ford's first hip hop influences included A Tribe Called Quest and Main Source to name a few. One of his first releases was The Underground Strikes Back by Suspekt (Move. Germany 1996) features DJ Format on production and scratching. He established a relationship with Jurassic 5 and initially travelled with them as their bus driver. He came to national attention in 2002 when he opened on tour for DJ Shadow. In 2005, If You Can't Join 'Em… Beat 'Em reached the top 10 of the UK indie albums chart. The Sun named his album If You Can't Join 'Em… Beat 'Em one of the top 100 of 2005, and in 2008 called him \\"one of the leading lights in the UK scene\\". DJ Format's debut album \\"Music for the Mature B-Boy\\" was one of the slowburn success stories of 2003. Received with quiet acclaim in the press it quickly became a word of mouth triumph, going on to establish itself as one of the most successful debut artist albums from the UK alternative/urban scene. The campaign was successful for a number of reasons not least its three music videos directed by the then unknown Ruben Fleischer. The most famous of these was the rap and breakdancing costumed animals of 'We Know Something You Don't Know' featuring the vocals of Chali 2na and Akil of Jurassic 5 – played out by a shark and tiger respectively. \\"Music For The...\\" also led to Format supporting (alongside regular collaborator MC Abdominal) Jurassic 5 on their European tour, and through subsequent touring in 2003 establishing Format as one of the hottest live hip hop tickets in town culminating in triumphant appearances at Glastonbury, Reading & Leeds festivals and worldwide touring taking in the whole of Europe, North America and Australia. In 2005 Format released his second album \\"If You Can't Join 'Em… Beat 'Em\\" and toured extensively throughout 2005/06. In 2006 Format's fabriclive 27 in the Fabric DJ mix series was one of the most well received of the series. His DJ sets are renowned for their boundary-crossing selection of the funk, soul, rock & hip- hop and his fabric mix showed off a condensed version of the party set that he's built a solid reputation on. This was followed up by his own underground mix of obscure Eastern European beats, the now highly collectable 'European Vacation' CD. In 2008 Format released another mix album, this time for the Fania label, applying his b-boy style to a catalogue of Latin music. Alongside this, Format also discreetly released a 12\\" tribute to James Brown, Stealin' James.

The film stars Katrin Cartlidge and Lynda Steadman. The women were originally thrown together when they shared a flat while at university and the film focuses on their interpersonal relationship. Plot In 1996, Annie is on the train to London to spend the weekend with Hannah, her flatmate when at polytechnic (the Polytechnic of North London) six years earlier. Hannah laments about her alcoholic mother, and Annie talks about her mother's search for a new boyfriend. Annie, who still lives with her mother, admires Hannah's independence. In contrast, Hannah laments being forced to be independent since she was a child. Back in 1986, Hannah and Claire interview and accept Annie into their flat. Annie and Hannah discuss getting rid of Claire the next year. Hannah and Annie discuss how Hannah hasn't cried since she was eight, when her parents split up. Annie, whose parents also divorced when she was eight, says she cries all the time. The following year, Ricky Burton, a socially awkward stutterer, has temporarily moved in with Hannah and Annie after being kicked out by his landlord. While discussing psychological traits with them in a pub, Ricky's untactful probing angers Hannah. While Ricky visits the Chinese takeaway beneath the flat, Annie and Hannah discuss the argument and how Ricky fancies Annie. In another memory, Ricky drunkenly confesses his love for Annie, but Annie says she's in love with someone else. Ricky leaves and doesn't reappear, so Hannah and Annie travel to his grandmother's home in Hartlepool. She tells them that Ricky has gone out, possibly along the seafront, so they go to look for him there. In the present, Annie accompanies Hannah as she looks for a flat to buy. One flat is owned by a Mr Evans, whose flat contains a painting of his naked ex-girlfriend and pornographic magazines. Evans hits on Hannah and offers both women alcoholic drinks. They run out of the flat making excuses, and are still laughing as they drive off. At the next flat, Adrian Spinks, an estate agent, meets them. Annie realises he is an old college boyfriend, but Adrian says he doesn't recognise them. In between their conversations, flashbacks show Hannah and Annie's history with Adrian. After meeting him at a club, Hannah takes Adrian home and sleeps with him. The following morning, he walks into Annie's room and tries to chat her up. In other flashbacks, Annie tells Adrian about a recurring sexual fantasy. Later, they kiss and discuss why he split up with his ex-girlfriend: Adrian says he didn't want the commitment, and leaves when Annie asks why. In the present, Hannah and Annie learn that Adrian is married with a child. At a Chinese restaurant, Annie and Hannah discuss how they have changed since university and wonder what happened to Ricky. Annie says she hadn't stopped thinking about Adrian for ten years. Hannah says she was hurt by the situation back then but said she didn't say anything because she knew that Annie was in love with him. In a flashback, Annie and Hannah cry and hug as they pack, preparing to leave their flat at the end of their four years at university. At the present-day dinner, Hannah recalls being overwhelmed upon meeting Annie's kind family, as opposed to her own dysfunctional family. They see their old flatmate Claire jogging, and discuss the coincidence of seeing two old acquaintances in one afternoon. They decide to visit their old flat, and there spot Ricky sitting on the steps outside the Chinese takeaway, holding a toy elephant. He seems angry and delirious, and tells them he arrived from Hartlepool the previous day. He says the toy is for his son, but the mother won't admit that the child is his. He tells them that his grandmother died, and, when Annie asks where he lives, responds that they don't care. They leave. In a flashback to their visit to Hartlepool, they find Ricky by the sea. They ask how he is and he shouts and swears at them that he doesn't care. They chase after him and he screams at them to leave him alone. In the present, they return to the railway station, where they say goodbye to one another.

However, in the 1995 HCM-analysis by Zappalà, Faïna is the parent body of the tiny Faïna family, which is not recognized by modern analysis. The HCM-method is based on an object's proper orbital elements to group asteroids into families. Faïna orbits the Sun in the central asteroid belt at a distance of 2.2–2.9 AU once every 4 years and 1 month (1,489 days; semi-major axis of 2.55 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.15 and an inclination of 16° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory on 8 May 2013, or two weeks after its official discovery observation by Grigory Neujmin at Simeiz.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Faina Mikhajlovna Neujmina, the first wife of the discoverer. Astronomer Lutz Schmadel compiled this , based on his private communication with \\"N. S. Samojlova-Yakhontova\\", as neither the Minor Planet Circulars nor The Names of the Minor Planets give any information about this asteroid's name.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Faïna is a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid, while in the Bus–Binzel SMASS classification, it is a hydrated carbonaceous Ch-type. = Rotation period = In late 1988, a rotational lightcurve of Faïna was obtained from photometric observations by Richard Miles at the Manley Observatory near Chester in northwest England. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). Alternative observations by Roberto Crippa, Federico Manzini (2006) as well as by Bruno Christmann (2019) determined a period of + and () hours (or half the period) with an amplitude of and magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Faïna measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has a low albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts the results from IRAS, that is, an albedo of 0.0497 and a diameter of 110.50 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 8.66. The WISE team also published several alternative mean-diameters of (), (), (), () and (), with a corresponding albedo of (), (), (), (), and (). On 28 March 2007, an asteroid occultation of Faïna gave a best-fit ellipse dimension of () with a quality rating of 2, indicating its irregular, elongated shape. Another occultation on 21 October 2012, gave an ellipse of (). These timed observations are taken when the asteroid passes in front of a distant star.

It now consists mostly of low-rise apartment buildings (built primarily in the 2000s) and formerly vacant mixed-use buildings and shops. Located a few blocks north of Bricktown and centered on NE 2nd Street, Deep Deuce was a regional center of jazz music and black culture and commerce during the 1920s and 1930s and the largest African-American downtown neighborhood in Oklahoma City in the 1940s and 1950s. Notable musicians that contributed to the rich jazz history of Deep Deuce includes singer Jimmy Rushing, swing and jazz guitarist Charlie Christian, the famous Blue Devils, Count Basie, Gonzelle White, King Oliver's bands as well as Ida Cox, Ma Rainey, Bessie Smith and Mamie Smith. After the civil rights movement of the 1960s, much of the city's African-American community dispersed to other areas within Oklahoma City.Dozier, Ray, \\"New life for Deep Deuce,\\" The Journal Record, December 29, 2000. Much of the neighborhood was bulldozed to make way for I-235 in the 1980s, but the current downtown boom and renaissance has made the area attractive to developers once again. Little of the neighborhood's original character remains today. As of March 2014, The Oklahoman reported that the area had only one remaining African-American owned business.Steve Lackmeyer, \\"Amidst Deep Deuce revival, fears of a lost history emerge\\", The Oklahoman, March 3, 2014.

Biography =Early life= Ivan Puni was born in Kuokkala (then Grand Duchy of Finland in the Russian Empire, now Repino in Russia) to a family of Italian origins. He was the grandson of an eminent Italian composer of ballet music, Cesare Pugni. His father, a cellist, insisted that he follow a military career, but Ivan instead decided to take private drawing lessons with Ilya Repin. By 1909, he had his own studio. =Career= Puni continued his formal training in Paris in 1910–11 at the Académie Julien and other schools, where he painted in a derivative fauviste style. Upon his return to Russia in 1912, he married fellow artist Kseniya Boguslavskaya, and met, and exhibited with, members of the St Petersburg avant-garde, including Kazimir Malevich and Vladimir Tatlin. He made a second trip to Paris in 1914, returning to St. Petersburg in 1915. At this point, he began painting in a Cubist style reminiscent of Juan Gris. In 1915, Puni, (Aleksandra Ekster, Liubov Popova, Ivan Kliun, Ksenia Boguslavskaya, Olga Rozanova, Nadezhda Udaltsova, Nina Genke and others) formed Supremus, a group of artists dedicated to the promulgation of Suprematism, the abstract art movement founded by Malevich, and first exhibited at the 0,10 Exhibition. Malevich and Puni co-authored the Suprematist Manifesto, published in 1916, which proclaimed a new, abstract art for a new historical era. Puni also organized the exhibitions Tramway 5 and 0.10, both held in St Petersburg in 1915, in which Malevich, Tatlin, Popova and others participated, and to which Puni contributed constructions, readymades, and paintings. In 1915-1916 Puni, together with other Suprematist artists, worked at Verbovka Village Folk Centre. In 1919, he taught at the Vitebsk Art School under Marc Chagall. =Years of Exile= Puni and his wife, Kseniya Boguslavskaya, emigrated from Russia in 1919, first to Finland, then in 1920 to Berlin, where the first exhibition consisting entirely of his work was held at the Galerie der Sturm. While in Berlin, Puni also designed costumes and sets for theatrical productions, and published a book criticising Suprematism. Puni and Boguslavskaya relocated to Paris in 1924, where his style changed once again to a variant of Impressionism. In France, he signed his work as \\"Jean Pougny\\", in an effort to distance his new art practice from his previous one in Russia. In 1946, Puni/Pougny became a French citizen. He died in Paris in 1956.

It was discovered on 25 September 1913, by German astronomer Franz Kaiser at the Heidelberg-Königstuhl State Observatory in southwest Germany. The S/L-type asteroid has an exceptionally long rotation period of 151 hours. It was named by its Latin name after Cupid, the Roman god of erotic love, attraction and affection.  Orbit and classification  When applying the synthetic hierarchical clustering method (HCM) by Nesvorný, or the 1995 HCM- analysis by Zappalà, Cupido is a member of the Flora family (), a giant asteroid family and the largest family of stony asteroids in the main-belt. However, according to another HCM-analysis by Milani and Knežević (AstDys), it is a background asteroid as this analysis does not recognize the Flora asteroid clan. Cupido orbits the Sun in the inner asteroid belt at a distance of 1.9–2.6 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,226 days; semi-major axis of 2.24 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.17 and an inclination of 4° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Yerkes Observatory in September 1933, or 20 years after to its official discovery observation by Franz Kaiser at Heidelberg Observatory in 1913.  Naming  This minor planet was named \\"Cupido\\", the Latin name of Cupid, god of erotic love, attraction and affection in Roman mythology whose Greek counterpart is Eros (also see asteroid 433 Eros). Cupido was named due to its relative proximity to the Sun probably by Swedish astronomer Bror Ansgar Asplind (1890–1954) who was honored by asteroid 958 Asplinda. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 ().  Physical characteristics  In the SDSS-based taxonomy, Cupido is an SL-type that transitions from the common, stony S-type asteroids to the uncommon L-type asteroids. = Rotation period = In October 2017, a rotational lightcurve of Cupido was obtained from photometric observations by American astronomer Frederick Pilcher in collaboration with Vladimir Benishek at Belgrade Observatory and Daniel A. Klinglesmith at Etscorn Observatory . Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). The observations also showed that it is a tumbling asteroid, which wobbles on its non-principal axis rotation. During the same opposition, Tom Polakis at the Command Module Observatory also observed the asteroid and measured a period of hours and an amplitude of magnitude (). The results supersede a tentative period determination of hours by René Roy from 2005. = Diameter and albedo = According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Cupido measures () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (). Other publications by the WISE team give a mean-diameter of (), () and () with a corresponding albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a Flora asteroid of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 8.97 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6.

It was one of Brown's more popular novels, and is in many ways representative of Brown's dark, gothic style and subject matter. It is also recognised as one of the most influential works of American and Philadelphia Gothic literature. It started earlier as a serial in Philadelphia's Weekly Magazine of Original Essays, Fugitive Pieces, and Interesting Intelligence, but it was discontinued due to several factors, such as lack of enthusiasm and the editor's death from yellow fever. Hence, Brown decided to issue the book himself. The novel summons the yellow fever epidemic in Philadelphia between August-October 1793, resulting to chaotic situations. Plot summary =Meeting Mervyn= Arthur Mervyn is discovered by Dr. Stevens sitting on a bench. He is suffering from yellow fever, and since Dr. Stevens has pity on him, is invited into the Stevens household. A little after he gets better, Mr. Wortley comes over to pay Dr. Stevens a visit, recognizes Arthur Mervyn, and reacts with extreme displeasure at seeing him. Dr. Stevens is of course suspicious of Mervyn now and demands an explanation for Wortley's reaction. Mervyn begins to tell his story in an effort to clear his name in the eyes of Dr. Stevens. This is the frame, and nearly three quarters of the book bring Mervyn's adventures up to this moment in time. The rest of the book continues on after the storytelling, with Mervyn keeping Dr. Stevens informed either in person or via letters of the continuing adventures, all of which revolve around a tightly knit network of people. Arthur Mervyn lived with his father and their servant, Betty, on a farm near Philadelphia. Betty, however, married the father and Mervyn could no longer remain in the house without conflict. Arthur leaves and heads toward the city, where he ends up penniless, as he has been cheated out of all his money on the way there. =Arrival in the city= Upon arriving in the city he seeks out a friend of his father's, but he never ends up meeting him. Instead he meets a man named Wallace who invites him to stay in his home for the night. Arthur follows Wallace home, and Wallace promptly locks him into a pitch dark room. Realizing that he has been tricked, Arthur tries to escape without being noticed. He does this, but not before he overhears a private conversation between the true occupants of his quarters. When Arthur does manage to escape, he leaves behind only his shoes and some open doors and windows. Without shoes or money he decides to head home but can't because he can't pay the bridge toll. He further begs money from a man he meets on the street, and is promptly hired by this man. =Welbeck introduced= The man in question is Welbeck, who is a thief and a forger. The encounter will cost Mervyn more than he stood to gain from begging. Welbeck dresses Mervyn in city clothes, introduces him to Clemenza Lodi, a woman he claims is his daughter and tells him that he will start work the following week. Mervyn soon discovers that Welbeck is a thief and a seducer (Clemenza is pregnant), putting Mervyn in so much trouble before he escapes and seeking refugee from Susan Hadwin. Mervyn decides to do a favour for Hadwin, by trying to carry Wallace, Hadwin's fiance who has been sick with yellow fever back to town. =Yellow fever epidemic= Mervyn begins to get sick, and fearing a forced trip to the hospital (a death trap), he decides to hide himself in the old Welbeck mansion. There he discovers none other than Welbeck, who has sneaked back to get the money he left in Father Lodi's book. He is outraged when he finds that Mervyn has already found it and intends to give it back to Clemenza. Welbeck tells him the money is forged and Mervyn promptly burns it. Welbeck has a conniption because he lied about the forgery and Mervyn has just destroyed 20,000 pounds. Welbeck leaves Mervyn to die, and Mervyn eventually wanders out into the street to see if he can make it back to the farm. He collapses and is rescued by Dr. Stevens. Thus ends the narrative up to the encounter with Dr. Stevens. After he gets better, Mervyn insists on returning to the Hadwin farm to make sure everyone is safe. After he leaves, though, he doesn't return for weeks and Dr. Stevens becomes very suspicious that Mervyn has escaped. One day, though, he is called to the debtors' prison, and discovers upon his arrival none other than Mervyn, who has summoned him there to tend to Welbeck, who lies languishing in the prison (he ultimately dies there). Before he dies, he gives Mervyn a scroll that holds 40,000 pounds or so that belong to Mrs. Maurice, but were recovered from Watson's dead body. =Helping Eliza Hadwin= Mervyn continues his narrative, recounting what happened after he left Dr. Stevens. Upon his arrival at Malverton (the Hadwin farm), he discovers that all but Eliza and Susan have died of yellow fever. An old man watches over them, but he is of little use. Susan dies the same day, unable to recover from the stress of waiting for her fiancé and the disappointment of finding that Mervyn is not the Wallace she had been waiting for. Mervyn, finding no alternative, buries Susan in the orchard. He then tries to house Eliza at her neighbor's farm, but he refuses her. They set out in the freezing weather and almost die, only to be saved by Mr. Curling. Mr. Curling agrees to take Eliza in until a better situation can be found for her (and her inheritance gets taken care of). Philip Hadwin, Eliza's uncle, turns out to be an awful man who refuses Eliza the inheritance she could have from the farm because Eliza's father took out a mortgage on the farm that belongs to Philip Hadwin. Mervyn returns to the city to help Clemenza Lodi, now living in the house of Mrs. Villars, a known prostitute. When he forces his way into the Villars country home, he discovers Clemenza on the third floor of the house, mourning her dying baby. He also encounters Mrs. Fielding, a young widow who had no idea her friends were prostitutes. Mervyn goes to Philadelphia to ask Mrs. Wentworth to house Clemenza Lodi and rescue her from her current situation. Mrs. Wentworth refuses, but ultimately agrees to house her if Mrs. Fielding will bear part of the cost. =Conclusion= Next, Mervyn “rescues” Eliza from boredom by placing her with Mrs. Fielding. He quickly realizes that he is in love with Mrs. Fielding. This comes as such a shock to him that he actually goes out to the house in the country where Mrs. Fielding is staying and stares up at her window at night. She is frightened, recognizes him, and tells him to see her in the city. The next day they finally admit their feelings to each other and agree to marry.

Amos Watson, Thomas Welbeck, Mrs. Wentworth, Ephraim Williams, Wortley, Caleb, Clavering, Colvill, Estwick, Jamieson, Medlicote =Main characters= Arthur Mervyn—The novel's protagonist. A farm boy who leaves rural area to move to Philadelphia. His transition from a rural child to a man of urban, eighteenth century America is the substance of the story. He is rash and acts on his convictions but, oddly enough, he is also a very analytical person. He eventually becomes apprentice to Dr. Stevens and marries Achsa Fielding, who is noteworthy for being the first Jewish-American character in American fiction.Jewish Archives  Reception  The novel generally received mixed reviews. Some scholars have argued Mervyn's character in the grey area, whether he is a hero or villain. The novel lacks the Brown's force to put Mervyn's character to be either. As it is also based by the historical precedents, Brown tried to persuade its readers that in order to provide the truth, a novel could stand beyond imagination. Emory Elliott, an American Academic describes the new edited novel as providing reliable materials constructed within the intellectual, cultural, political, and religious context of a society. Many of Brown's works are related to revolution, but the political revolution only takes a small part on the novel, emphasizing more on the revolution of mental. Explicit rebellions also plays significant part on the revolutionary part of the novel.  Development  The sequel, Arthur Mervyn; or; Memoirs of the Year 1793. Second Part was released in 1800 in a very rare follow-up and only a few collectors obtained both volumes separately. The novel has also influenced other American Gothic authors such as Edgar Allan Poe, in writing The Masque of the Red Death published in 1842.

Supporters are envisaging a reform in which the Governor-General is replaced by a directly elected figurehead president and the Prime Minister of Australia remains the head of government. Important models in this class There are many proposals by individuals or small groups for a direct-election model, however the following is a list of models in this class which have been canvassed through governmental institutions: * RAC Popular Election model (1993) * Gallop model by Geoff Gallop (1998) * Hayden model by Bill Hayden (1998) * ARM Model 4 - People elect the President (2001) * ARM Model 5 - People choose from Parliament's List (2001) Rationale If implemented, the model would establish an Australian Republic by removing constitutional links to the monarchy. References to either Queen or Governor-General in the Australian constitution would be replaced by a reference to the President of Australia. The resulting structure would be similar to other parliamentary republics where the President has very little or no discretionary power. Supporters of the model say that, although elected, the change to a republic is argued to have minor but positive impact on the rest of Australia's parliament and government. The elected President would be a true figurehead for the Australian people. New provisions in the constitution could prevent the President from taking control of the government away from the Prime Minister. History Direct election of the Governor-General was considered in the conventions leading to the federation of Australia, however rarely revisited until the advent of the modern republican movement. In 1993 direct- election was reviewed as one of four options by the Republic Advisory Committee, chaired by Malcolm Turnbull. A partial and complete codification of the reserve powers of this model were presented. Prime Minister Paul Keating rejected this option saying it would \\"constitute a very dramatic and undesirable change to a system which all of us agree has served us well\\" Under Prime Minister John Howard, two models were closely examined and criticised at the 1998 constitutional convention. During voting, the Hayden model was first to be eliminated, however supporters of that model did not transfer all their support to the more popular Gallup model which was consequently next to be eliminated. Vizard, Steve, Two Weeks in Lilliput: Bear Baiting and Backbiting At the Constitutional Convention (Penguin, 1998, ) At the 1999 Australian republic referendum, many direct-election republicans voted NO and ensured the defeat of the bi-partisan appointment model. After the defeat, the Australian Republican Movement changed tactic and presented six republic options, of which three involved direct-election. Model 4 was developed from the Hayden model and Model 5 was developed from the Gallop model. Model 6 proposes a directly elected executive president, which would not retain the existing parliamentary system. The 2004 Republican Senate Inquiry included models 4 and 5 in a recommendation that a plebiscite be conducted offering five alternative methods of selecting a head of state. According to opinion polls, if such a plebiscite were held, electors would be more likely to support direct-election models over alternatives.

It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Joseph Rheden at the Vienna Observatory in Austria, on 21 November 1913.  Description  Lightcurve-based 3-D model of Libera The metallic X-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–3.3 AU once every 4 years and 4 months (1,576 days). Its orbit shows an eccentricity of 0.25 and is tilted by 15 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. A photometric observation of the asteroid's light-curve performed at the Palmer Divide Observatory during 1999 rendered a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of 0.57 magnitude. The result concurs with several previous observations, including a photometric analysis conducted over a twelve-year interval. According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the U.S. Wide- field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid's surface has an albedo of 0.13 and 0.14, respectively, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link publishes a slightly lower figure of 0.12 from an alternative result of the Supplemental IRAS Minor Planet Survey. The minor planet was named by Mrs. Hedwig Rheden in honor of a friend of the discoverer.  References   External links  * Lightcurve plot of 771 Libera, Palmer Divide Observatory, B. D.

History of schools The original campus of Twain was a red brick building. Originally Twain's magnet program was focused on after-school programs. In the 1980s parents in the area considered Twain to be an undesirable school. In 1986 a group of parents at Bethany United Methodist Weekday School decided to organize the group Friends of Mark Twain to call for an improvement in Twain and lobbied on its behalf. The school's reputation improved and, according to former principal Joyce Dauber, by 1996 75% of the parents of students lived in the school's neighborhood.Markley, Melanie. \\"Regardless of where they live, parents ask same question: How good are the schools?\\" Houston Chronicle.

It was discovered on 22 December 1913, by German astronomer Franz Kaiser at Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany. The asteroid is classified as a D-type and T-type body in the Tholen and SMASS taxonomy, respectively. The rare spectral T-type is similar to D-types which are often found among Jupiter trojans thought to have originated from the Kuiper belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.6–3.1 AU once every 4 years and 10 months (1,763 days). Its orbit is tilted by 17 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows a low eccentricity of 0.08. According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite, IRAS, the Japanese Akari satellite, and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the minor planet's low albedo lies in the range of 0.04–0.05. It has a well- defined rotation period of 6.75 hours, determined by several concurring observations. 773 Irmintraud commemorates the antiquated German feminine name, Irmtraud, that appears frequently in old songs and sagas. The asteroid is a likely source of the Tagish Lake meteorite which landed in Canada on January 18, 2000.  History  In 1992, Larry Lebofsky and colleagues published an article in which they noted that \\"unaltered asteroids are thought to represent the raw materials available for terrestrial planet formation and so are important to our understanding of the origin and evolution of the Solar System.\\"Lebofsky, Larry A. (1992) NASA Scientific and Technical Information Program Office An Infrared Reflectance Study of Low Albedo Surface Constituents. N92-10830. Since at least 1980, it was believed that D-type asteroids were unaltered asteroids, ultraprimitive in composition and composed largely of hydrated silicates and organic material. However, in analyzing the spectra of 773 Irmintraud for the water of hydration band (the 3-µm absorption feature of hydrated silicates), Lebofsky discovered the first D-type asteroid to show the water of hydration band on the surface of the asteroid. Lebofsky concluded that 773 Irmintraud had undergone an alteration process typically seen in a C-type asteroid, making 773 Irmintraud and perhaps other D-type asteroids less likely to represent the raw materials available for terrestrial planet formation. In addition, the discovery of water of hydration band on 773 Irmintraud meant that there may be major differences in mineralogy within individual type classification and astronomers must be careful in assuming that the C-, D-, and other type classification relate directly to mineralogy. In 1997, NASA added 773 Irmintraud and eventually over one million other names to a microchip placed on board the Stardust spacecraft that launched February 7, 1999.NASA (July 16, 2001) Microchip Names (I). Accessed June 12, 2008. Placing the names onto the Stardust spacecraft was a public outreach effort. In particular, this served to promote public interest, awareness and support of the space program. Preliminary spectrum graph of asteroid 773 Irmintraud, a main belt D-type asteroid that appears to show the presence of a 3-µm wavelength water of hydration band. In September 2001, there was speculation that Tagish Lake meteorite which struck in British Columbia, Canada on January 18, 2000, was derived from a D-type asteroid, since the spectral shape and brightness of the meteorite was similar to D-type asteroids. Of the three studied, the 0.032 IRAS albedos (8) of 368 Haidea and the 0.033 IRAS albedos (8) of 773 Irmintraud are both considered close to the reflectance of the Tagish Lake meteorite. Moreover, even though 368 Haidea was closest spectrally to the Tagish Lake meteorite, 773 Irmintraud was no more than 0.034 AU to a chaotic zone associated with one of the Kirkwood gaps due to the mean motion resonance with Jupiter. This made 773 Irmintraud the closest of the three candidates to the associated chaotic zone and thus the most likely of the three as the source of the 2000 Earth impacted meteorite. The idea that humans held a piece of the asteroid 773 Irmintraud spurred others to act. In 2002, the University of Tokyo performed near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic observations of 773.Ai, Kanno. (2002) Astronomical Herald Photometric and Near-IR Spectroscopic observations of a D-type asteroid, (773) Irmintraud, by SUBARU/IRCS. VOL.95; NO.11; PAGE.507-514. Accession number: 02A0834926; Japanese language Journal Code: F0543A; ISSN 0374-2466 In addition, the University obtained an accurate lightcurve in Japan through visible photometry and ultimately found a gap between K- and L-band spectra. From this, the university concluded that results support the idea that Tagish Lake meteorite has a link with D-type asteroids.

It was discovered by German astronomer Franz Kaiser at the Heidelberg- Königstuhl State Observatory on 24 January 1914. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid (Cb) has a rotation period of 12.8 hours. It was named after Johannes Gutenberg (ca. 1400–1468), who introduced the printing press to Europe and started the Printing Revolution.  Orbit and classification  Gutemberga is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the outer asteroid belt at a distance of 2.9–3.6 AU once every 5 years and 10 months (2,119 days; semi-major axis of 3.23 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.11 and an inclination of 13° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Heidelberg on 22 December 1924, almost 11 years after its official discovery observation.  Naming  This minor planet was named after Johannes Gutenberg (ca. 1400–1468), a German inventor who started the Printing Revolution with the introduction of mechanical movable type printing. Gutenberg lived and died in Mainz and the neighboring Eltville am Rhein. The was mentioned in The Names of the Minor Planets by Paul Herget in 1955 (). The crater Gutenberg on the Moon and the feature Rimae Gutenberg, a 223-kilometer long groove near the crater, were also named after him.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen-like taxonomy of the Small Solar System Objects Spectroscopic Survey (S3OS2), Gutemberga is a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. In the Bus–Binzel SMASS-like taxonomic variant of the S3OS2, it is a Cb-subtype, which transitions from the C-type to the somewhat brighter B-type asteroid. = Rotation period = In January 218, a rotational lightcurve of Gutemberga was obtained from photometric observations by Tom Polakis at the Command Module Observatory in Arizona. Lightcurve analysis gave a well-defined rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude (). The result supersedes observations by Otmar Nickel of Astronomical Consortium of Mainz from February 2001, which gave a period of hours with an amplitude of magnitude (), and observations by Astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California, with a period of hours and an amplitude of magnitude.(). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite, the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, Gutemberga measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link derives an albedo of 0.0494 and a diameter of 65.57 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.8. Alternative mean-diameter measurements published by the WISE team include () and () with corresponding albedos of () and (). On 27 June 2008, an asteroid occultation of Gutemberga gave a best-fit ellipse dimension of (), with a poor quality rating of 1.

(1983). North American Indian Wars The battle occurred on September 28, 1874 when several U.S. Army regiments under Ranald S. Mackenzie attacked a large encampment of Plains Indians in Palo Duro Canyon in the Texas Panhandle. Background Late in the summer of 1874, Quahada Comanche, Southern Cheyenne, Arapaho and Kiowa warriors led by Lone Wolf left their assigned reservations and sought refuge in Palo Duro Canyon in the Texas Panhandle.Carter, R.G., 1935, On the Border with Mackenzie, Washington D.C.: Eynon Printing Co. There they had been stockpiling food and supplies for the winter. Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, leading the 4th U.S. Cavalry, departed Fort Clark, Texas on August 15, reached Fort Concho on the 21st and the mouth of Blanco Canyon on the 23rd with eight companies plus three from the 10th Infantry and one from the 11th Infantry. Mackenzie's orders from General Christopher C. Augur stated he was \\"at liberty to follow the Indians wherever they go, even to the Agencies.\\" Mackenzie formed three columns, the first column consisting of eight companies of the 4th Cavalry and two infantry companies, the second column under Lt. Col. George P. Buell consisting of five companies of the 9th Cavalry, one from the 10th Cavalry, and two infantry companies, and the third column under Lt. Col. John W. Davidson consisting of eight companies of the 10th Cavalry and two infantry companies. The first column moved north along the edge of the Staked Plains, the second advanced up the Red River and the third marched from Fort Sill. By September 25, Indians began to gather around Mackenzie's troops so that on the night of September 2627, they were attacked near Tule Canyon and Boehm's Canyon, resulting in the deaths of 15 warriors including the Kiowa chief Woman Heart. Early in September, Black Seminole Scouts in advance of the 4th Cavalry were ambushed by Comanche near the Staked Plains and escaped with their lives. The scouts relayed the Comanche position and put Mackenzie on alert. The battle Highway 207 north of Silverton, Texas Early on the morning of September 28, two of Mackenzie's Tonkawa scouts found a \\"fresh trail\\" and Mackenzie resumed the march, reaching a \\"wide and yawning chasm\\" at dawn, where they could see the Indian lodges. Mackenzie's cavalry dismounted and led their horses single- file along a narrow zig-zag path. Mackenzie first hit Chief Lone Wolf's Kiowa camp and routed it. Chiefs Poor Buffalo and Lone Wolf and the Indians managed to get away, leaving behind their possessions and horses, climbing up both sides of the canyon. The Indian warriors began firing on the troops from 800–1000 feet above, making \\"it so hot\\", it prompted one to say, \\"How will we ever get out of here\\", to which Mackenzie stated, \\"I brought you in, I will take you out\\". Part of the command started a retreat up the \\"precipitous cliffs\\" from which they had descended while others pulled down the lodges, chopped up the lodge poles, and burned all of the Indian belongings in huge bonfires. Almost 2000 horses were captured and moved from the canyon with the remaining troops by 4 PM. Mackenzie's troops made it back to their supply camp in Tule Canyon on the morning of the 29th. Results The loss of the Palo Duro camp meant the loss of the Indians' safe haven and all of their winter supplies. Some horses fled with the Indians onto the plains but Mackenzie was able to capture 1500-2000 ponies, which he slaughtered to prevent them from falling into the hands of the Indians. Casualties were light in the engagement since it had been a complete rout, but without sufficient mounts or supplies the tribes could not hold out over the winter and many returned to the Fort Sill reservation by November 1874; Lone Wolf's Kiowas did not return until February 1875.

Naming  According to Alexander Schnell, this minor planet was likely named after Irene Hillebrand, née Weiss, daughter of Austrian astronomer Edmund Weiss (1837–1917), director of the Vienna Observatory, and wife to astronomer (1861–1939). The name received an aea-suffix as \\"Irene\\" was already given to asteroid 14 Irene. Palisa also named asteroid 722 Frieda after her daughter, Frieda Hillebrand.  Physical characteristics  Irenaea is an assumed, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. The asteroid's low albedo around 0.05 (see below) agrees with this assumption. = Rotation period = In May 2008, a rotational lightcurve of Irenaea was obtained from photometric observations by Italian amateur astronomer Silvano Casulli. Lightcurve analysis gave a rotation period of hours with a brightness variation of magnitude, indicative of an elongated shape (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, and the Japanese Akari satellite, Irenaea measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for a carbonaceous C-type asteroid of 0.057 and calculates a diameter of 30.59 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 11.3.

It was discovered by Austrian astronomer Johann Palisa at the Vienna Observatory on 26 September 1914. The carbonaceous C-type asteroid has a poorly determined rotation period of 9.3 hours and seems rather spherical in shape. Any reference of the asteroid's name to a person is unknown.  Orbit and classification  Fini is a non-family asteroid of the main belt's background population when applying the hierarchical clustering method to its proper orbital elements. It orbits the Sun in the central main-belt at a distance of 2.5–3.0 AU once every 4 years and 7 months (1,665 days; semi-major axis of 2.75 AU). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 19° with respect to the ecliptic. The body's observation arc begins at Vienna Observatory on 16 March 1917, where it was officially discovered two and a half years before.  Naming  \\"Fini\\" is an Austrian diminutive of Josephine. Any reference of this minor planet name to a person or occurrence is unknown. = Unknown meaning = Among the many thousands of named minor planets, Fini is one of 120 asteroids, for which no official naming citation has been published. All of these asteroids have low numbers, the first being . The last asteroid with a name of unknown meaning is . They were discovered between 1876 and the 1930s, predominantly by astronomers Auguste Charlois, Johann Palisa, Max Wolf and Karl Reinmuth.  Physical characteristics  In the Tholen classification, Fini is a common, carbonaceous C-type asteroid. It is also a C-type in the taxonomic classification based on near-infrared colors from the MOVIS-catalog, which was created from data gathered by the VISTA Hemisphere Survey conducted with the VISTA telescope at Paranal Observatory in Chile. = Rotation period = Several rotational lightcurves of Fini have been obtained from photometric observations. However, the asteroid, which shows a notably low brightness variation – indicative of a spherical rather than elongated shape – still has a poorly determined rotation period. Based on observations from February 2003 and November 2011, Brian Warner at his Palmer Divide Observatory in Colorado, determined three possible period solutions of , and hours with corresponding low amplitudes of , and magnitude (). Petr Pravec and Peter Kušnirák at Ondřejov Observatory derive a rotation period of hours from their observations in October 2001, or half of Warner's period solution, also with an amplitude of 0.2 magnitude (). In September 2010, astronomers at the Palomar Transient Factory in California determined an alternative period of with a brightness variation of 0.06 magnitude (). = Diameter and albedo = According to the surveys carried out by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite IRAS, the NEOWISE mission of NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), and the Japanese Akari satellite, Fini measures (), () and () kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of (), () and (), respectively. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link adopts Petr Pravec's revised WISE-data, that is an albedo of 0.0553 and a diameter of 62.56 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 9.78. Alternative mean-diameter measurements published by the WISE team include (), (), (), () and () with corresponding albedos of (), (), (), () and (). On 11 November 2006, an asteroid occultation of Fini gave a best-fit ellipse dimension of () with a low quality rating of 1.

She chaired the Lady Galway Patriotic Guild. Early life and career Elizabeth Gilmer passport photo (1925) Born as Elizabeth May Seddon at Kumara to the future New Zealand Prime Minister Richard Seddon and Louisa Spotswood Seddon, she attended the Kumara School and Wellington Girls' College. Throughout her life she was involved in a staggering array of welfare and women's organisations in addition to her most abiding interests which were conservation and horticulture. She was a prominent member of the Wellington branch of the National Council of Women and represented New Zealand at the international council's conference at Lugano, Switzerland, in 1949. From 1934 to 1957 she served as the Government nominee on the Wellington Colleges' Board of Governors. She worked on the passage of the Native Plant Protection Act and the reinstatement of Arbor Day. Political career Gilmer was a member of the Wellington Hospital Board from 1938 to 1953. As a result of her advocacy, the hospital developed the most up-to-date maternity service in New Zealand. Her perpetual interest in nurses' welfare led to vast improvements being made in the conditions under which they worked. In 1941 she was elected to the Wellington City Council, where she served 12 years as chair of both the Libraries and Parks and Reserves Committees. At the 1944, 1947 and 1950 local elections she \\"topped the poll\\", receiving more votes than any other candidate. In recognition of this, she was nominated for the position of deputy mayor in 1950, but lost in a ballot to William Stevens. Gilmer’s own colleagues in the Citizens' Association backed Stevens in preference to her, though she Elizabeth Gilmer passport application (1925) received the support of the Labour Party councillors. Dropped from the Citizens' Association ticket in 1953, she accepted the request of a public deputation to stand for re- election as an independent, but lost her seat on the council. She stood twice for Parliament unsuccessfully in both the and general elections in the electorate as an independent candidate, but declined to accept nomination for any political party, though in the latter she received tacit support from the National Party. Honours For her contributions during the First and Second World Wars, Gilmer was awarded, firstly, the OBE (1946), and then the DBE (1951). She was the first New Zealand woman to be awarded a knighthood. Gilmer was awarded the Greek Red Cross medal in 1937, and the Coronation Medal in 1953. Family On 3 July 1907, at St Paul's Church, Thorndon, Wellington, she married Knox Gilmer (1879–1921); they had two daughters. They lived at Te Marua, Upper Hutt. Death Gilmer died at Wellington on 29 February 1960, less than a month before her 80th birthday.

It runs from State Road 998 in Homestead north across U.S. Route 41 to U.S. Route 27 near Countyline Dragway (formerly Opa-locka West Airport), just south of the Broward County line. Its main use is as a bypass around the western side of Miami, linking the routes that run southwest, west and northwest from that city. The road passes through newer suburbs in the southern third of its length, while the northern two thirds of the highway traverse the eastern edge of the Everglades. Route description Kendall Drive; the undeveloped western boundary of The Hammocks is on the right and a large cornfield is on the left (January, 2008) State Road 997 begins in Homestead at the western terminus of SR 998 on Campbell Drive. The road heads north exiting Homestead and enters unincorporated Miami-Dade county, immediately entering farmland north of Southwest 296th Street, and becoming increasingly rural the further north it journeys. SR 997 passes through the rural community of Redland, crossing CSX tracks north of Southwest 232nd Street. after leaving Homestead, SR 997 forms the western terminus of SR 994 northwest of the remains of Aladdin City. After a few more miles and crossing the Black Creek Canal, SR 997 chicanes to the right, crossing over the Conrad Yelvington branch railroad where it forms the western boundary of the suburban The Hammocks up to its junction with SR 94, the latter's western terminus. Past here, the road enters woodland and is relatively uninterrupted for the next , save for the Conrad Yelvington facility, reaching the Tamiami Trail (US 41) at its northern end. After passing the Miccosukee Indian casino and resort, SR 997 has an uninterrupted run north along the boundary of the Everglades, turning northeast after . After crossing the Miami Canal later, SR 997 terminates after at US 27. History State Road 205 was defined in 1931 to run from Flamingo (now inside Everglades National Park) northeast to State Road 4A (now U.S. Route 1) in Florida City along the Ingraham Highway. There it would run concurrent with US 1 into Homestead (US 1 ran through downtown Florida City and Homestead, instead of the bypass it uses now), splitting onto the existing Krome Avenue to end at State Road 27 (U.S. Route 94, the Tamiami Trail, now U.S. Route 41). In the 1945 renumbering, the State Road 27 number was assigned to all of the former State Road 205, as well as an extension north to State Road 25 (now U.S. Route 27). The large Everglades National Park was formed in 1947, taking over most of SR 27 southwest from Florida City. Paving of this road, mostly along the old Ingraham Highway, was completed in 1956. The extension north to SR 25 opened in the early 1950s. In the mid-1960s, State Road 5 (U.S. Route 1) was rerouted onto a bypass of Homestead and Florida City. This removed the concurrency of SR 997 and SR 5/US 1, but the old alignment became State Road 5A and U.S. Route 1 Business until 1968. The SR 27 designation for Krome Avenue confused many motorists, as the SR 27 designation belonged to the nearby Tamiami Trail (U.S. Route 41) prior to the 1945 renumbering. Tamiami Trail was still labeled as SR 27 on maps for several years following 1945. In later decades, motorists confused Krome Avenue for Okeechobee Road, which carried the similarly numbered U.S. Route 27 since 1949. In 1983, the Florida Department of Transportation renumbered the road as a part of a statewide renumbering and to avoid state road number confusion. The part north of Florida City became State Road 997, which was extended south past the turnoff for the Everglades to merge with U.S. Route 1. The part southwest from Florida City became State Road 9336, and at some point it was extended east two blocks past SR 997 to US 1. Since the late 1960s, plans to incorporate the southern portion of Krome Avenue into Miami-Dade County's system of expressways have been repeatedly announced and killed. The original plans for the Homestead Extension of Florida's Turnpike incorporated a continuation from the southwest end of the current State Road 874 southwest to Krome Avenue, then southward to Homestead. When the proposal was defeated in 1971, the Turnpike Extension was rerouted to the present-day configuration. In December 2014, FDOT began work to turn Campbell Drive between SR 997 and US 1 into a truck by-pass, eliminating the need for truck traffic to pass through downtown Florida City and Homestead. The widening of Campbell will resulted in its addition to the state highway system as State Road 998.. In exchange, FDOT shortened SR 997 on Krome Avenue by relinquishing the segment south of Campbell to Miami-Dade County, which now exists as unsigned County Road 997. Krome Avenue is named for William J. Krome. Krome was a railroad engineer for the Florida East Coast Railway and is known for leading an expedition to survey Cape Sable for a route for the Overseas Railroad to Key West. Krome ended up mapping much of Everglades for the first time. Krome is also known for his contributions to agriculture in the area. He was a member of the Florida State Horticultural Society and operated orchards in Redland. Future - widening With increasing traffic and increasing numbers of accidents on Krome Avenue, discussions of widening the highway had begun by the 1980s. A project began in 2015 to widen the highway to 4 lanes with a median for its entire length, starting at Okeechobee Road in 2015 and with the final southern sections to start in 2019. Disapproval has arisen from Redland and Homestead, as the people living in those areas express their fear of increasing traffic changing the rural character of their neighborhoods. Farmers also worry that the widening will hinder access to the fresh produce that they sell. There are also environmental objections to the project, including light pollution from new street lights being installed for the entire length of the highway. This will change the nature of the road from a rural bypass route to a third outer loop or \\"beltway\\" of Miami after the Palmetto Expressway and the HEFT amid a burgeoning population and increasing traffic congestion, possibly putting pressure on the county Urban Development Boundary, which protects against westward encroachment into the Everglades. The first section to begin construction was the northern segment from Tamiami Trail to the Okeechobee Road terminus, followed by the middle segment from Tamiami down to SW 88 Street/Kendall Drive.

The centre opened on 9 November 1977 with 88 stores and 2300 parking spaces. There are over 350 stores and over 6300 free car parking spaces, making the centre the third- largest in Australia, and Scentre Group's second-largest centre in Victoria in terms of gross leasable area, behind Westfield Fountain Gate. There is also a seven-storey office tower at the southern side of the centre as well as low- rise offices dotting the O-Zone precinct, an indoor food court, and an outdoor restaurant strip mall. In October 2012, the Westfield Group acquired AMP's share of the centre and was subsequently rebranded as Westfield Knox.  History  Former logo of Knox City Shopping Centre, and the logo for the Knox-O-Zone. Planning for the development of the shopping centre commenced in 1972 when McIntyre, McIntyre and Partners Pty. Ltd. won a $30 million tender from the AMP Society to design the new complex in Wantirna South. Their successful design led to the construction of a Brutalist style building. Architect Peter McIntyre was given the Buildings Award Medal by the Victorian Chapter of the Royal Australian Institute of Architects in 1978 for the design of Knox City Shopping Centre. Construction commenced in 1975 when the shopping centre was originally going to be named \\"Studwood Shopping Centre\\", however this name was later abandoned. The shopping centre was officially opened on 9 November 1977. The centre originally included a three-storey Myer department store, a twin Dendy Cinemas complex, public library, Target discount department store, Target supermarket, McEwans hardware and 83 speciality shops. A seven-storey high office tower was constructed on the south side of the building at the same time. Throughout 1989 and 1990, the centre was doubled in size and the original section completely refurbished. A fourth floor was added to the Myer store, the undercover car parks were expanded and new promenade, market and food court areas were added. The Target supermarket was removed and new Coles and Bi-Lo supermarkets opened. Target was also expanded in size. Venture also opened on level two where Toys 'R' Us resided The twin cinemas were replaced with a 10-screen Village Cinemas complex, which opened in 1988 (replaced in 2002 and now unused above JB Hi-Fi). On the adjacent block an outdoor shopping centre was established, known as the Knox District Centre (later Knox Towerpoint and now Knox O-Zone). During 1997, the centre saw a minor refurbishment. An updated logo was introduced, along with new signage to complement. The food court was remodelled and introduced food decorations on the walls above the food outlets, palm trees, new tables and chairs as well as the opening of Hungry Jack's. Lincraft was also relocated when McEwans closed down. However, it, itself has closed down to make way for a new Harris Scarfe in October 2009. Best & Less moved into Lincraft's old retail space. The Reject Shop also moved from opposite Coles to The Market area. In 2002, the centre was extended further at a cost of $150 million. The Knox Towerpoint complex was renamed Knox O-Zone and joined to Knox City Shopping Centre through an expansion of the shopping centre eastwards and redevelopment of the O-Zone shops. The eastern section of the centre was completely redeveloped, which opened on 17 October 2002 with the new Knox O-Zone opening on 31 October. The exterior of the existing shopping centre was also painted. Currently there are over 350 retailers throughout the complex and 6,391 car parking spaces available. In October 2012, Westfield Group purchased the centre, adding it to their franchise. As of July 2014, the Westfield Group became two companies Scentre Group and Westfield Corporation. The Westfield Group portion is now owned by Scentre Group. =Planned Expansion= As of October 2014, an application to expand the centre has been approved by the Knox City Council. Planning foresees a $450 million expansion southward from 142,500 m2 to 188,500 m2, becoming the second largest centre in Australia, only behind Chadstone. Beginning by 2016 and opening in stages from 2017, the project includes an international retail and fashion precinct, a new cafe area and the relocation of a discount department store further towards the Burwood Hwy frontage to accommodate for new corridors. Secondary refurbishments and upgrades to the Ozone precinct will commence in 2015, including the relocation of the bus interchange and library into this area, east from their present locations. Approximately 2650 additional parking spaces from new multi-deck car parks will also be available. However, as of September 2017, there has been no expansion of the shopping centre, with no word of when construction will begin. The permit to expand Westfield Knox will expire in November 2017 unless extended time is granted. The longer the expansion is put off, the more urgent it has become, as many of the stores and foyers have started to look tired, dull and dated. The Myer store is currently in a poor state, where carpet is wearing out, floor tiles are missing, paint peeling and shelves being damaged. The second Coles supermarket (formerly a BI-LO) had suffered lighting issues on occasions in the last years; Coles and Myer are likely waiting for the redevelopment for the state of their stores to improve. In December 2019, the Knox Council released completed plans to refurbish Westfield Knox. There wil be a smaller Myer with two floors and casual dining precinct with outdoor children's play area. Stewart White of Scentre Group - who lodged plans on behalf of Westfield and is the group's development and strategic asset management director - said that the updated plans include a fresh food, fashion, and casual dining precinct. He also said that the library would be relocated into Knox Ozone while not revealing a specific location. Knox will introduce retail partners and dedicated office space in retail space that used to belong to Myer. Transport Westfield Knox provides parking for around 6300 vehicles and is serviced by 11 bus routes and taxis.  Filming  The mall has been utilised as a filming location a number of times in recent years for the Australian television soap, Neighbours, particularly the Village Cinemas entrance. It was also used in the comic show full frontal in season 2 mainly using the entrance of Village Cinemas References External links * * Scentre Group - Knox Category:Shopping centres in Melbourne Category:Shopping malls established in 1977 ","title":"Westfield Knox"},{"id":"3033583","text":"Danylo Kyrylovych Zabolotny (1866 in Chobotarka, Podolia Governorate - 1929) was a Ukrainian epidemiologist and the founder of the world's first research department of epidemiology.

Living in Princeton, New Jersey, Stockton wrote and published her poems in leading newspapers and magazines of the day and was part of a Mid-Atlantic writing circle. She was the author of more than 120 works, but it was not until 1985, when a manuscript copybook long held privately was given to the New Jersey Historical Society, that most of them became known. Before that, she was known to have written 40 poems. The copybook contained poems that tripled the amount of her known work. A complete collection of her works was published in 1995. She is featured in the permanent exhibit at Morven Museum & Garden in Princeton, NJ. A member of the New Jersey elite, Stockton was the only woman to be elected as an honorary member of the American Whig Society, a secret revolutionary group. After the American Revolutionary War, they recognized Stockton's service in protecting their papers during the British attack on Princeton. Early life and education Annis Boudinot was born in 1736 in Darby, Pennsylvania, to Elias Boudinot, a merchant and silversmith, and Catherine Williams. The Boudinot ancestors were French Huguenot refugees who came to the North American colonies in the late 17th century. She was the second of ten children, of whom about half survived to adulthood. Marriage and family Around 1757, Boudinot married Richard Stockton, an attorney from a prominent family. Part of the New Jersey elite class, they had several children. During the American Revolution, her husband was one of the signatories of the Declaration of Independence. Annis Stockton became known as the \\"Duchess of Morven,\\" their mansion and estate in Princeton, New Jersey, where they entertained many prominent guests. These included George Washington, with whom Annis Stockton had a correspondence, sending him numerous poems as part of it. Morven was named after a mythical Gaelic kingdom in a poem by Ossian. Morven would become the New Jersey Governor's Mansion between 1944 and 1981. During the war, British general General Cornwallis plundered Morven, burned Stockton's \\"splendid library and papers, and drove off his stock, much of which was blooded and highly valuable.\\" (\\"Blooded\\" means purebred and thus valuable.) Richard Stockton had escaped but was later captured and imprisoned by the British. He suffered lasting ill effects to his health and died in 1781 at the age of 51, before the official end of the war. The Boudinot-Stockton families were also connected through Annis's younger brother Elias Boudinot. He had studied law with her husband to prepare for the bar. After establishing himself as an attorney, Elias married Hannah Stockton, Richard's younger sister. Boudinot became a statesman from New Jersey and was elected as President of the Continental Congress in 1782–1783. He signed the Treaty of Paris. Literary career Annis Boudinot Stockton was one of the first female published poets in the Thirteen Colonies. She published 21 poems in the \\"most prestigious newspapers and magazines of her day.\\" They addressed political and social issues, and she used the wide variety of genres considered integral to neoclassical writing: odes, pastorals, elegies, sonnets, epitaphs, hymns, and epithalamia. Her works were read both in the colonies and internationally, in England and in France.Annis Boudinot Stockton, Only for the Eye of a Friend: The Poems of Annis Boudinot Stockton, ed. by Carla Mulford, University of Virginia Press, 1995. She was well known as a prolific writer among her Middle Atlantic writing circle, which included Elizabeth Graeme Fergusson, Benjamin Young Prime, Samuel Stanhope Smith, Philip Freneau, and Hugh Henry Brackenridge. Stockton's connection to Fergusson also linked her to such women writers as Anna Young Smith, Susanna Wright, Milcah Martha Moore and Hannah Griffitts. At the time, many of these writers passed most of their works to each other in manuscript. This was particularly true of women. Because of that, they were not as well known to later scholars as writers whose works were published, but they represented an active and influential part of the literary culture. In the late twentieth century, more manuscripts of their works have been made available to the public and some have been published. In 1984 Christine Carolyn McMillan Cairnes and her husband George H. Cairnes donated a large manuscript copybook containing numerous poems and other pieces by Stockton to the New Jersey Historical Society. The following year, this copybook was made available to researchers for the first time. Before then, Stockton was known to have written 40 poems, but the pieces in the copybook expanded the total of her works threefold. In 1995 the scholar Carla Mulford published a collection of 125 poems, all of Stockton's known pieces; she also provided a lengthy introduction that provided insights into the poet's time and late eighteenth-century society. A patriot in her own right, Stockton rescued and hid important papers of the American Whig Society prior to the British invasion of Princeton, as it was a secret society committed to the revolution. After the war, the Society honored her as an honorary member for her services, the only woman to be so recognized.\\"Annis Boudinot Stockton\\", Colonial Hall, accessed 5 August 2012. In correspondence with George Washington, whom she had hosted at Morven, Stockton sent him both poems and letters. His reply to one, giving an idea of their shared topics, may be seen at The Papers of George Washington, University of Virginia.

He attended Trinity College in Perth, Western Australia and is most well known for taking the 2004 AFL Mark of the Year. AFL career Recruited by the Eagles at number six in the rich 2001 AFL National Draft, Sampi debuted against Geelong in round 14 of the 2002 season. In his debut season, Sampi played four games, including a final. Playing as a small forward, Sampi's AFL career was inconsistent; despite being a regular part of the side though the 2003 to 2005 seasons, he did not reach the heights that were expected of him given his original high selection. The high point of Sampi's career was his AFL Mark of the Year in 2004 against . Sampi was also selected in the Eagles' 2005 losing Grand Final team, but took a major step backward in the 2006 season, losing his regular spot in the team, and only managing twelve games though poor form, and not playing in the Eagle's victorious 2006 AFL Grand Final team. Sampi's form seems to have often been related to weight issues. During the 2007 pre-season, Sampi was at times required to train separately from the rest of the club to deal with his weight issues; however, they seemed to come back under control, and he was reinstated to the main training list. Despite this, he failed to be selected for a single game throughout 2007, and he was delisted at the end of the season. Despite training with in late 2007, he was not recruited by the Demons, with a lack of fitness being cited as the main reason. He played for Port Fairy in 2008. Controversy Sampi was locked in a paternity battle with his ex-girlfriend Christina Taylor. She claims that her daughter (born 27 December 2006), was the result of a planned pregnancy with Sampi. However, Sampi refused to sign the birth certificate or visit the child until it is proven that she is his daughter.Row Leads To Paternity Test For Sampi During 2006, Sampi allegedly threatened his girlfriend and her sister with a knife.Eagles star Sampi wanted for questioning References External links WAFL statistics Category:1984 births Category:Living people Category:Indigenous Australian players of Australian rules football Category:Indigenous Australians from Western Australia Category:West Coast Eagles players Category:South Fremantle Football Club players Category:Port Fairy Football Club players Category:People educated at Trinity College, Perth Category:Australian rules footballers from Western Australia Category:People from the Kimberley (Western Australia) Category:People from Perth, Western Australia ","title":"Ashley Sampi"},{"id":"3033622","text":"John D.

The ampulla is specifically located at the major duodenal papilla. The ampulla of Vater is an important landmark halfway along the second part of the duodenum that marks the anatomical transition from foregut to midgut, and hence the point where the celiac trunk stops supplying the gut and the superior mesenteric artery takes over. Structure The cystic duct leaves the gallbladder and joins with the common hepatic duct to form the common bile duct. This duct subsequently joins with the pancreatic duct; this junction is known as the ampulla of Vater. The pancreatic duct delivers substances such as bicarbonate and digestive enzymes to the duodenum. The bile from the gallbladder contains salts which emulsify large fat droplets into much smaller units. This provides a large surface area for the lipase enzymes to act on. The bicarbonate neutralises the acidic chyme, creating alkaline conditions for enzymes such as chymotrypsin and amylase to function optimally. Function Various smooth muscle sphincters regulate the flow of bile and pancreatic juice through the ampulla: the sphincter of the pancreatic duct, the sphincter of the bile duct, and the sphincter of Oddi. The sphincter of Oddi controls the introduction of bile and pancreatic secretions into the duodenum, as well as preventing the entry of duodenal contents into the ampulla. Clinical relevance Pancreatitis can result from a failure of pancreatic secretions to drain properly. One possible cause of impaired drainage of pancreatic juice is blockage of the sphincter of Oddi. A common cause of blockage is a gallstone in the common bile duct. Thomas' sign is the production of silver stools and can be indicative of cancer of the Ampulla of Vater. The silver colored stool is a combination of the white stool of obstructive jaundice combined with black stool of melena or bleeding. It was first described in the British Medical Journal by Dr. H. Ogilvie in 1955. History The eponymic term \\"ampulla of Vater\\" is named after Abraham Vater (1684–1751), a German anatomist who first published a description of it in 1720.

Bryges or Briges () is the historical name given to a people of the ancient Balkans. They are generally considered to have been related to the Phrygians, who during classical antiquity lived in western Anatolia. Both names, Bryges and Phrygians, are assumed to be variants of the same root. Based on archaeological evidence, some scholars such as Nicholas Hammond and Eugene N. Borza argue that the Bryges/Phrygians were members of the Lusatian culture that migrated into the southern Balkans during the Late Bronze Age.Borza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon. Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 1990, , p. 65. \\"What can be established, despite an extremely slight archaeological record (especially along the slopes of Mt. Vermion), is that two streams of Lusatian peoples moved south in the later Bronze Age, one to settle in Hellespontine Phrygia, the other to occupy parts of western and central Macedonia.\\"The Gordion Excavations 1950-1973: Final Reports Volume 4, Rodney Stuart Young, Ellen L.

Histories, 7.73. \\"The Phrygian equipment was very similar to the Paphlagonian, with only a small difference. As the Macedonians say, these Phrygians were called Briges as long as they dwelt in Europe, where they were neighbors of the Macedonians; but when they changed their home to Asia, they changed their name also and were called Phrygians. The Armenians, who are settlers from Phrygia, were armed like the Phrygians. Both these together had as their commander Artochmes, who had married a daughter of Darius.\\" a movement which is thought to have happened between 1200 BC and 800 BCBorza, Eugene N.

In the Balkans, the Bryges occupied central Albania and some parts of northern Epirus, as well as Macedonia, mainly west of the Axios river, but also Mygdonia, which was conquered by the kingdom of Macedon in the early 5th century BC.Thucydides. The Peloponnesian War, 2.99. They seem to have lived peacefully next to the inhabitants of Macedonia.Borza, Eugene N. In the Shadow of Olympus: the Emergence of Macedon.

Small groups of Bryges, after the migration to Anatolia and the expansion of the kingdom of Macedon, were still left in northern Pelagonia and around Epidamnus. Herodotus also mentions that in 492 BC, some Thracian Brygoi or Brygians (Greek: Βρύγοι Θρήικες) fell upon the Persian camp by night, wounding Mardonius himself, though he went on with the campaign until he subdued them.Herodotus. Histories, 6.45 These Brygoi were later mentioned in Plutarch's Parallel Lives, in the Battle of Philippi, as camp servants of Brutus.Plutarch. The Parallel Lives (Brutus). However, modern scholars state that a historical link between them and the original Bryges cannot be established.Wilkes, J. J. The Illyrians. Blackwell Publishing, 1992, , p. 111. \\"The presence of Bryges at Epidamnus in the account of Appian seems to be confirmed by other sources, including the Coastal Voyage attributed to Scymnus of Chios and Stabo's Geography.

There is no certain derivation for the name and tribal origin of the Bryges.

She had paddle wheels and her coal-powered two- cylinder side-lever engine (from Robert Napier) had a power output of about 740 indicated horsepower with a coal consumption around 38 tons per day. She was relatively fast for the time: her usual speed was about , but she could do better if the winds and currents were favourable.

It aired on XM Satellite Radio channel 124, and Sirius Satellite Radio channel 143 both in the United States until 2007-09-24. The channel also existed on Sirius Canada until February 2007. Each morning, the channel featured a six-hour news wheel, produced by ABC News Radio. In the afternoon, hourly newscasts preceded some of ABC Radio's top talk show talent, like Sean Hannity, KABC's Larry Elder and WBAP's Mark Davis. History ABC News & Talk used to host a mid-day talk show exclusively for satellite radio titled Live from 125. The show's host was rotated on a weekly basis so there were several different program personalities. This show was discontinued in 2006. In September 2006, John Batchelor took a leave of absence from the ABC Radio network. Mark Levin took his place on the ABC News & Talk lineup. Levin's show was broadcast on a 2-hour tape-delay basis, which was assumed to be twofold: to protect Elder's spot in the lineup, since Elder had the slot prior to Levin's arrival, and so Levin can continue to grow his terrestrial affiliate base. The channel was programmed by ABC Radio until June 12, 2007, when it was turned over to Citadel Broadcasting as part of the divestiture by ABC parent Disney of nearly all of its radio assets.

Nichols. Early business in the area included a swimming pool called the Paseo Plunge, a dry cleaner, drug store, shoe repair store, and restaurants. The Spanish Village era is said to have ended in the mid-1950s. Renewal Paseo has undergone transformations; currently, the Paseo is enjoying a renaissance since the 1980s. Today, a vibrant group of artists and other interested people are transforming this community through creative thinking and arts activities. Located along Paseo Drive at roughly N. Walker Ave and NW 28th Street, the faux Spanish village with its stucco buildings and clay tile roofs is the home to many of Oklahoma City's Artists. It is also home to a number of chic bars, restaurants, boutiques, nightclubs, art galleries, and avant-garde businesses. Events Since 1975, Paseo hosts the annual Paseo Arts Festival each Memorial Day weekend, which showcases original works of visual and performing arts. Other events within the Paseo Arts district include its annual Fairy Ball, as well as the First Friday Gallery Walk. The First Friday Gallery Walk is an event in which Paseo art galleries and restaurants host Art Opening Receptions on the first Friday of every month to display new artist's work and invite people to visit the Paseo district.

Oklahoma City photographer Tom Lee purchased the church in 2000 and had it dismantled and moved to Oklahoma City to serve as his studio. Lee sold the church in 2007 to be rented as a venue for weddings and other events.

Belmont Avenue, Chicago, Illinois. The building was designed by architect John Nyden and is on the National Register of Historical Places. It was constructed in a U-shape around a two-story central atrium, which allowed light to reach the bank lobby—the glass atrium has since been roofed over. When the building was first completed, it held the Belmont–Sheffield Trust and Savings Bank on the first floor and part of the second; offices on the rest of the second floor and on the third floor; and the Montfield Hotel (address 3146 N. Sheffield) on floors four through six. However, the bank closed on June 24, 1932, due to financial difficulty following the Great Depression. The bank portion of the building then remained vacant until World War II, when local rationing board 40-46 took over the space. The building also housed the Lake View Citizens' Council in the 1950s. It struggled with vacancy until 1984, when a developer received a federal loan to convert the Montfield Hotel into 54 apartments, maintaining stores on the ground floor. The building was sold again to another developer and the upper floors converted into loft condos in 2005, which are now listed at the address 3150 N. Sheffield. In 2008, the Commission on Chicago Landmarks designated the building a landmark along with 15 other neighborhood bank buildings. References * \\"Bank at Belmont and Sheffield Gets New Home\\".

Although he served the club for many years as coach and committee man, he is perhaps best known for captaining the Bulldogs to their first VFL premiership in 1954. Recruited from Spotswood, Sutton was a tough, nuggety footballer who embodied the club's fighting spirit. He played as a rover and half forward, but it was as a back pocket player that he made his name. In 1950, he finished equal third in the Brownlow Medal count and won the Con Weickhardt Trophy (as it was then known) as the Bulldogs' best and fairest player that season. He was captain-coach of the team from 1951 to 1955. After his retirement as a player, Sutton coached Footscray from 1956 until 9 July 1957, when he was unceremoniously dismissed and replaced by Ted Whitten. Sutton later returned to coach Footscray in 1967 (replacing Ted Whitten) and 1968 (after which he resigned having decided that the ever-increasing demands of coaching clashed far too much with his business of running a hotel at Yarraville). In 1978 Sutton took over the position of President of the Footscray Football Club when Dick Collinson resigned. He has the Western Bulldogs best and fairest award, the Charles Sutton Medal, named in his honour. In 1996 Sutton was inducted into the Australian Football Hall of Fame. Sutton died in 2012 at the age of 88.  References  Bibliography * Ross, J.

The cradle (also known as aerial cradle or casting cradle) is a type of aerial circus act in which a performer hangs by his or her knees from a large rectangular frame and swings, tosses, and catches another performer. The aerialist being swung is referred to as a flyer, while the one doing the tossing and catching is referred to as a catcher or caster. The flyer usually starts and ends standing on the frame above the catcher. The flyer swings holding on to the catcher's hands, performs releases at the top of the swing, and is re-caught in mid-air. The frame can be static or swinging. A variant called the Russian cradle or Korean cradle has the catcher/caster standing, secured by a safety belt.

According to the narrative, Allan Gordon was the sole survivor of the Anne Forbes, a whaling ship that disappeared without a trace in 1757. According to a modern editor of Hogg's work, the character of Allan Gordon was inspired by Robinson Crusoe and Hogg's interest, at the time, in polar exploration. Sarah Moss also identifies Mungo Park's Travels in the Interior of Africa, accounts of the Ross and Parry expeditions, William Scoresby's Account of the Arctic Regions and The Rime of the Ancient Mariner as inspirational sources for the narrative. Fictional history The Surpassing Adventures of Allan Gordon by James Hogg reportedly preserved the autobiographical accounts of Allan Gordon to schoolmaster John Duff (According to Gillian Hughes, \\"Hogg originally wrote after this ‘having been sent to me as a curiosity by the Earl of Fife to whom I have to express my grateful acknowledgement’, and then changed the latter part of this to ‘the late ingenious Duchess of Gordon in a quarto vol. among many other curious relics copied for her Grace by a clever amanuensis. I expressed my acknowledgements to her long ago and now thus publicly acknowledge it once again’). According to the accounts, Allan was the son of Adam Gordon, a farm worker. Allan was born in \\"a small cottage three miles above\\" Huntly, Scotland. Adam Gordon taught his son to read but not write. He then arranged for his son an apprenticeship to a tailor of Huntly, starting c. 1751. The tailor was reportedly a \\"little crooked wretch\\" who repeatedly took out his anger on his apprentice in the form of physical and psychological abuse. After nearly a year of maltreatment, Allan refused to take another beating. Subsequent arguments amongst the pair escalated into physical fighting and, on one particular day of violence, Allan left his employer unconscious on the ground. On that same day the 12-year-old Allan left Huntly for Aberdeen. Allan first found employment as a cabin boy and later as a sailor, which remained his occupation for the following five years. By this time Allan had reportedly become attached to the \\"nautical life\\" and enjoyed visiting new cities with every voyage. He joined the crew of the Anne Forbes for the first time in 1757. John Hughes, captain of the Anne Forbes, was described by Allan as a \\"drunken rash headlong fool\\" of an Englishman. Sole survivor Allan was only 17 years old when the Anne Forbes hit an iceberg in the Arctic fog somewhere off the coast of Greenland. According to the story Allan told when he returned to Aberdeen in 1764, he was thrown from his lookout point onto the iceberg by the force of the collision. The Anne Forbes, soon after apparently sinking, resurfaced (presumably due to air trapped in the holds of the ship) and was eventually forced onto an underwater ledge of the iceberg where it quickly froze in place. Allan lived for some time in the imprisoned ship before finally escaping. This is remarkably similar to the events that transpired in September 1854 when noted explorer Captain Elisha Kane's ship, the USS Advance, sank in the Arctic seas. In other media Allan Gordon was the main character of Arthur J. Roth's book The Iceberg Hermit. The Adventures of Allan Gordon is the name of a song by The Fall of Troy. On their Live At The Paradox EP (when they were called The Thirty Years' War) guitarist Thomas Erak made reference to 'The Iceberg Hermit' before playing the song.

They formed in 1958 at the Eagle House youth club in Knowle West, Bristol. Led by lead guitarist Terry Clarke (11 June 1944, Bristol – 29 October 2008), who used a homebuilt custom instrument, the group included drummer Rod Meacham (born Roderick Meacham, 25 March 1943, Bristol, died 21 March 2002, Bristol), bassist Michael Brice (born 4 March 1944, Bristol), and Johnny Payne on rhythm guitar (born John Payne, 1944). Playing primarily instrumental rock, they began their career playing local venues in Bristol such as dance halls. They were launched into the world of professional music in 1962 after being noticed by composer Ron Grainer, probably best remembered for his theme to Doctor Who. Grainer was interested in the Eagles for a film project on which he was working, Some People, about a fictional Bristol band not unlike themselves. The Eagles contributed to the Some People soundtrack, and became Grainer's protégés, recording new versions of some of his film score work, such as the theme of the television series Maigret. The Some People soundtrack reached No. 2 on the EP charts, and remained on the charts for 21 weeks. The group were awarded the Duke of Edinburgh Trophy for their work on the film, and soon afterward were signed to Pye Records, at the time among the top three labels in Britain. After releasing the singles \\"Bristol Express\\" and \\"Exodus (Main Theme)\\", the Eagles embarked on a major tour of England along with Del Shannon, Stevie Wonder, Johnny Tillotson, and Dionne Warwick. The tour lasted much of 1963, during which their debut album, Smash Hits From The Eagles, was released in the UK and the US. The following year brought their most successful single and the one for which they are best remembered today, a vocal rendition of \\"Wishin' and Hopin' \\", with the B-side \\"Write Me a Letter\\". After the Eagles Clarke continued to play with local bands until the 1980s, and then played as a duet with his wife (building his wife's bass guitar) in Bristol until his death in 2008. Payne returned to Bristol and also continued to play with local bands. Brice continues his music career playing with the band 'The Ivy League'. The Eagles' music is available on many compilation albums of the era, and in 1998 Sanctuary Records released a 61-track double album set, Smash Hits from The Eagles and The Kestrels.

Early life Azhar was born in Bahawalpur, Punjab, Pakistan on 10 July 1968 (although some sources list his birth date as 7 August 1968 ) as the third of 11 children—five sons and six daughters. Azhar's father, Allah Bakhsh Shabbir, was the headmaster at a government-run school as well as a cleric with Deobandi leanings and his family operated a dairy and poultry farm. Azhar dropped out of mainstream school after class 8 and joined the Jamia Uloom Islamic school, from where he graduated out in 1989 as an alim and was soon appointed as a teacher. The madrasa was heavily involved with Harkat-ul-Ansar and Azhar was subsequently assumed under its folds, after being enrolled for a jihad-training camp at Afghanistan. Despite failing to complete the course; he joined the Soviet–Afghan War and retired after suffering injuries. Thereafter, he was chosen as the head of Harkat's department of motivation. He was also entrusted with the editorial responsibilities for the Urdu-language magazine Sad’e Mujahidin and the Arabic-language Sawte Kashmir. Azhar later became the general secretary of Harkat-ul-Ansar and visited many international locations to recruit, to raise funds and to spread the message of Pan-Islamism. Among his destinations were Zambia, Abu Dhabi, Saudi Arabia, Mongolia, the United Kingdom and Albania. Activities in Somalia Azhar confessed that in 1993 he traveled to Nairobi, Kenya to meet with leaders of al-Itihaad al-Islamiya, an al-Qaeda-aligned Somali group, who had requested money and recruits from Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM). Indian intelligence officials believe that he made at least three trips to Somalia and that he also helped bring Yemeni mercenaries to Somalia. Activities in the UK In August 1993 Azhar entered the UK for a speaking, fundraising, and recruitment tour. His message of jihad was given at some of Britain's most prestigious Islamic institutions including the Darul Uloom Bury seminary, Zakariya Mosque, Madina Masjid in Blackburn and Burnley, and Jamia Masjid. His message was that \\"substantial proportion of the Koran had been devoted to 'killing for the sake of Allah' and that a substantial volume of sayings of the Prophet Muhammad were on the issue of jihad.\\" Azhar made contacts in Britain who helped to provide training and logistical support the terror plots including \\"7/7, 21/7 and the attempt in 2006 to smuggle liquid bomb-making substances on to transatlantic airlines.\\" Harkat-ul-Ansar In 1993, the militant organisation Harkat-ul-Ansar was established and Masood served as its general secretary. In 1998, U.S.'s Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in its report stated, \\"HuA, an Islamic extremist organisation that Pakistan supports in its proxy war against Indian forces in Kashmir, increasingly is using terrorist tactics against Westerners and random attacks on civilians that could involve Westerners to promote its pan-Islamic agenda.\\" CIA also stated that Hua had abducted at least 13 persons of which 12 were from western countries in the period from early 1994 to 1998. Arrest in India In early 1994, Azhar travelled to Srinagar under a fake identity, to ease tensions between Harkat-ul-Ansar's feuding factions of Harkat-ul-Jihad al-Islami and Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. India arrested him in February from Khanabal near Anantnag and imprisoned him for his terrorist activities with the groups. On being arrested, he said \\"Soldiers of Islam have come from 12 countries to liberate Kashmir. We will answer your carbines with rocket launchers\\" In July, 1995, six foreign tourists were kidnapped in Jammu and Kashmir. The kidnappers, referring to themselves as Al-Faran, included the release of Masood Azhar among their demands. One of the hostages managed to escape whilst another was found in a decapitated state in August. The others were never seen or heard from since 1995. FBI had interrogated Azhar multiple times during his jail-stay on the locus of the kidnappings. Release after hijacking Four years later, in December 1999, an Indian Airlines Flight 814 (IC814) en route from Kathmandu in Nepal to New Delhi was hijacked and eventually landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan after being flown to multiple locations. Kandahar at that time was controlled by Taliban, which was initially thought to be on India's side, but later was suggested to be working with Pakistan's ISI. Masood Azhar was one of the three militants demanded to be released in exchange for freeing the hostages. Subsequently, Azhar was freed by the Indian government in a decision criticised by many including Ajit Doval as a \\"diplomatic failure\\". The hijackers of IC814 were led by Masood Azhar's brother, Ibrahim Athar. His release from Kot Bhalwal jail was supervised by an IPS officer, S P Vaid. His younger brother Abdul Rauf Asghar had planned this attack. Once Masood Azhar was handed over to the hijackers, they fled to Pakistani territory. Pakistan had said the hijackers would be arrested if found, a difficult task given the length of the border and multitude of access points from Afghanistan. The Pakistani government also previously indicated that Azhar would be allowed to return home since he did not face any charges there. Shortly after his release, Azhar made a public address to an estimated 10,000 people in Karachi. He proclaimed, \\"I have come here because this is my duty to tell you that Muslims should not rest in peace until we have destroyed India,\\" vowing to liberate the Kashmir region from Indian rule. In 1999, after Masood's release, the Harkat-ul-Ansar was proscribed by the U.S. and added to the list of banned terrorist organisations. This move forced Harkat-ul-Ansar to change its name to the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM). Jaish-e-Mohammed Azhar planned to start a new outfit named as, Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM). He reportedly received assistance from Pakistan's spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Osama bin Laden and multiple Sunni sectarian organisations based in Pakistan. JeM is run by Azhar's family like a family enterprise. Jamia Binoria madarsa linked JeM with the Afghan Taliban. =2001 Indian Parliament attack= Jaish-e-Mohammed carried out a string of deadly attacks against Indian targets, including the attack on the Indian parliament in December 2001 that brought India and Pakistan to the brink of a full-scale war.Tanner, Marcus (2001-12-17) Pakistan blamed by India for raid on parliament. The Independent The terrorist attack on the Parliament of India in New Delhi happened on 13 December 2001. The perpetrators belonged to Lashkar- e-Taiba (LeT) and Jaish-e-Mohammed (JeM), both Pakistan-based terrorist organisations. The attack led to the deaths of five terrorists, six Delhi Police personnel, two Parliament Security Service personnel and a gardenerin total 14and to increased tensions between India and Pakistan, resulting in the 2001–02 India–Pakistan standoff. Soon after the Indian parliament attack, on 29 December 2001, Masood Azhar was detained for a year by Pakistani authorities, after diplomatic pressure by India and International community, in connection with the attack but was never formally charged. The Lahore High Court ordered an end to the house arrest on 14 December 2002, much to the fury of India. Azhar was never arrested after that. =2008 Mumbai attacks= On 7 December 2008, it was claimed that he was among several arrested by the Pakistani government after a military raid on a camp located on the outskirts of Muzaffarabad in connection with the 2008 Mumbai attacks. He continued to live in Bhawalpur. Pakistan's government denied it had arrested Masood Azhar and said it was unaware of his whereabouts On 26 January 2014, Azhar reappeared after a seclusion of two years. He addressed a rally in Muzaffarabad, calling for the resumption of jihad in Kashmir. His group, Jaish-e-Muhammad, claims he is currently in Srinagar, India. =2016 Pathankot attack= The 2016 Pathankot attack on Indian air base is said to be masterminded by Masood Azhar and his brother. They were in direct touch with terrorists even after the attack had begun. Indian investigative agencies have given dossiers containing proofs of Azhar's complicity in the terror attack and also sought a second ʽred corner noticeʼ from ʽInterpolʼ. =2019 Pulwama attack= On 14 February 2019, a convoy of vehicles carrying security personnel on the Jammu Srinagar National Highway was attacked by a vehicle- bound suicide bomber in Lethpora near Awantipora, Pulwama district, Jammu and Kashmir, India. The attack resulted in the death of 44 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel and the attacker. The responsibility for the attack was claimed by the Pakistan-based Islamist militant group Jaish-e-Mohammed. He approved the attacks from the Pakistani Army Hospital where he is under protective custody. After the attack, France, United Kingdom and United States moved a proposal at UN Security Council to ban Masood. Sanctions The U.S. Treasury is prohibiting Americans from \\"engaging in any transactions\\" with three Pakistan-based militants and a front group. Al Rehmat Trust, called \\"an operational front\\" for Jaish-e Mohammed, was designated for providing support to and for acting for or on behalf of that group, and Mohammed Masood Azhar Alvi, Jaish-e Mohammed's founder and leader, was designated for acting on behalf of the group. US Department of the Treasury . Treas.gov. Retrieved on 2013-03-14. The Chinese government blocked a UN Security Council Sanctions Committee listing of Azhar as a terrorist, thwarting international efforts to disrupt the activities of his group. Starting 2009, there have been 4 attempts to put Masood Azhar in the UN Security Council's counter-terrorism sanctions list. All the attempts were vetoed by China, citing 'lack of evidence'. China moved to protect Azhar again in October 2016 when it blocked India's appeal to the United Nations to label him as a terrorist. China also blocked US move to get Azhar banned by UN in February 2017. The most recent attempt was on 13th March 2019. However, China pulled the blockade in May 2019, finally resulting listing of Masood Azhar as a global terrorist.

The Black Petrel (Procellaria parkinsoni) ranges in the Pacific Ocean, and as far north as Central America. The Spectacled Petrel (Procellaria conspicillata) is confined to the Atlantic Ocean, and the Westland Petrel (Procellaria westlandica) to the Pacific Ocean. The White-chinned (Procellaria aequincotialis) and Grey Petrel (Procellaria cinerea) range throughout the higher latitudes of the Southern Ocean. Taxonomy Procellaria is a member of the family Procellariidae and the order Procellariiformes. As members of Procellariiformes, they share certain characteristics. First they have tubular nostrils called naricorns. This feature gives them their common name, tubenoses. The opening to the nostril is located differently in some birds. These birds have the opening on top of the upper bill. Second, they produce a stomach oil that contains wax esters and triglycerides. This oil fills two functions. When predators threaten the birds or their chick or egg, they spit the substance on them. This substance has an awful smell, and mats the feathers down, degrading their usefulness. Also, they can digest the wax esters for a high energy source of food, during long flights or the period of time that they are incubating their egg or caring for their young. They also have a uniquely structured bill, with seven to nine distinct horny plates.Double, M. C. (2003) Finally, they have a salt gland that is located above their nasal passages and helps desalinate their body, as they drink seawater. They excrete the salty waste out their nose.Ehrlich, Paul R.

This is in reference to their association with stormy weather. The word petrel is derived from St. Peter and the story of his walking on water. This is in reference to the petrel's habit of appearing to run on the water to take off.Gotch, A. T. (1995) Range and habitat They range from the cold waters of the Southern Ocean to temperate waters, and are pelagic except during the breeding season. Behaviour These tubenoses fly like shearwaters, with stiff wings and shearing technique across wave fronts. This technique saves energy.ZipCode Zoo (19 Jun 2009) During breeding season they utilize coastal cliffs on islands, laying their single egg in a burrow.

Originally a housing development, it is just east of Mordialloc. It is Australia's only suburb that's 20% parkland and 40% water. Over 46 hectares of wildlife sanctuary were artificially created in and around the swampy marshlands of Mordialloc Creek. The Waterways suburb location is environmentally sensitive as it is situated directly between two conservation areas, Braeside Park and the Edithvale wetlands Edithvale-Seaford Wetlands. Planning permits are strictly regulated and gardens monitored to keep the suburb as native as possible for the abundant wildlife in the area. The Mornington Peninsula branch of the Bird Observers Club of Australia or PENBOC have documented 105 different species of birds in the area. For this reason cats are also forbidden. History Construction on Waterways Estate began in May 2000, due to end within five years. Waterways got its name from its waterways which are essentially a number of man made wetlands and giant lakes in and around the estate. The lakes serve as a Melbourne Water filtration system for fresh water flowing down from Dandenong and Mordialloc Creeks then into Port Phillip Bay. Although the development was due to be completed in 2006, the developer applied for, and was subsequently granted permission from Kingston Council to increase the suburb's size.

Elmslie was born in Lethbridge, near Geelong, and although he had a secondary education, he followed his father's trade as a stonemason. He was employed on the first Wilson Hall at Melbourne University and on St Patrick's Cathedral. From 1888 he was an official of the Operative Stonemason's Society, and a delegate to the Melbourne Trades Hall. He was also President of the South Melbourne Football Club, ancestor of the Sydney Swans. In 1898, Elmslie was one of the founders of the Victorian Labour Federation, which had as its object \\"the unification of the workers in one all- comprehensive and extensive union.\\" In 1902 he was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as Labor member for Albert Park. Labor in Victoria in the early federal period was much weaker than in the other states, partly because of the continuing attraction of Deakinite liberalism for many voters, partly because Victoria did not have the huge pastoral and mining areas that the other mainland states had. The Parliamentary Labor Party remained small and contained limited talent. Elmslie became deputy leader in 1912 and leader in 1913. At the 1911 election, Labor won only 20 seats to the various factions of the Liberal Party's 43. But in December 1913 the Liberal Premier, William Watt resigned after a dispute with the rural faction of his own party. The acting Governor, Sir John Madden, surprised the Liberals by sending for Elmslie, who on 9 December formed Victoria's first Labor government. Elmslie had no chance of a long tenure, or even of meeting the House as Premier, since under the law of the time ministers had to resign their seats and contest by-elections before they could take their seats. The Liberal factions re-united, and Watt moved a no-confidence motion in Elmslie, which Elmslie had to watch from the gallery since he was technically not a member. Elmslie was duly voted out and Watt resumed office on 22 December. Elmslie remained as Labor leader until shortly before his death in 1918, although his health had broken down in 1916, requiring a long break. During World War I Elmslie supported the Allied cause but opposed conscription for overseas service. He died at his home in South Melbourne and was given a state funeral. Elmslie was largely forgotten until members of the Labor Historical Graves Committee discovered his neglected grave in the Melbourne General Cemetery in the 1990s. A new memorial headstone over his grave was unveiled by Steve Bracks, Labor Premier of Victoria, on 9 March 2001.

She worked with William on his thesis, which concerned the correlation between blood pressure levels and deception. He later developed this into the systolic blood-pressure test used to detect deception that was the predecessor to the polygraph test. In 1921, Marston received her MA from Radcliffe and William received his PhD from Harvard. Although Marston is not listed as William's collaborator in his early work, a number of writers refer directly and indirectly to Elizabeth's work on her husband's blood pressure/deception research.

Career and family Elizabeth and William married in 1915. She first gave birth at age 35, then returned to work. During her long and productive career, she indexed the documents of the first fourteen Congresses, lectured on law, ethics, and psychology at several American universities, and served as an editor for Encyclopædia Britannica and McCall's. She cowrote a textbook, Integrative Psychology, with her husband and C. Daly King. In 1933, she became the assistant to the chief executive at Metropolitan Life Insurance. Sometime in the late 1920s, Olive Byrne, a young woman William had met while teaching at Tufts University, joined the household. Marston had two children, Pete and Olive Ann, while Byrne also gave birth to two of William's children, Byrne and Donn. The Marstons legally adopted Olive's boys, but Olive remained a part of the family, even after William's death in 1947. Olive stayed home with the children while Marston worked. Continuing at MetLife until she was sixty-five, Elizabeth put all four children through college and Byrne through medical school and Donn through law school as well. She and Olive continued living together until Olive's death in 1990.

It was invented in 1888-1889 by two Austrian engineers named Siersch and Kubin, and used in Austria-Hungary to load artillery shells. Ecrasite was patented secretly, and its composition was once unknown. Ecrasite is prepared by the partial nitration of a crude mixture of cresol and phenol with a mixture of concentrated sulfuric and nitric acids and the neutralisation of the product with ammonia to produce a crude salt similar to ammonium picrate. Ecrasite is a bright yellow solid. It is waxy to touch and melts at about 100 °C. When subjected to open flame, it burns without detonation, unless confined. It is insensitive to friction. It requires a detonator for initiation. Its general adoption was hindered by several unexplained explosions during loading into shells, which might have been caused by creation of unstable metal salts of trinitrocresol and/or trinitrophenol when the explosive came in contact with metals or alloys such as copper, brass (widely used for manufacturing detonator parts) and possibly other ones.Nitro-Explosives: A Practical Treatise by P.

As an autonym, it necessarily contains the type species of Banksia, B. serrata (Saw Banksia). Within this constraint, however, there have been various circumscriptions. Banksia verae B. subg. Banksia can be traced back to Banksia verae, an unranked taxon published by Robert Brown in his 1810 Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen. Under Brown's arrangement, Banksia was divided into two groups based on inflorescence shape. Banksia verae was defined as containing those Banksia taxa with the elongate flower spike typical of Banksia, and it thus contained all but one species. The remaining species, B. ilicifolia (Holly-leaved Banksia), has a dome-shaped head and so was placed alone in Isostylis. Brown published a further eleven species in 1830, placing all of them in Banksia verae. The 1830 circumscription of Banksia verae was as follows: :Banksia ::Banksia verae :::B. pulchella :::B. sphærocarpa :::B. nutans :::B. ericifolia :::B. spinulosa :::B. Cunninghamii (now B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii) :::B. collina (now B. spinulosa var. collina) :::B. occidentalis :::B. littoralis :::B. marginata :::B. depressa (now B. marginata) :::B. patula (now B. marginata) :::B. australis (now B. marginata) :::B. insularis (now B. marginata) :::B. integrifolia :::B. compar (now B. integrifolia subsp. compar) :::B. verticillata :::B. coccinea :::B. paludosa :::B. oblongifolia :::B. latifolia (now B. robur) :::B. marcescens (now B. praemorsa) :::B. media :::B. attenuata :::B.

Brownii ::Isostylis (one species) Eubanksia Banksia verae was renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in his 1847 fourth supplement to Genera Plantarum Secundum Ordines Naturales Disposita, and this name was retained in Carl Meissner's 1856 arrangement. Meissner gave Eubanksia sectional rank, further dividing it into four series, B. ser. Abietinæ, B. ser. Salicinae, B. ser. Quercinae and B. ser. Dryandroideae. These series were defined in terms of leaf shape alone, and were hence all highly heterogeneous, with the exception of B. ser. Abietinæ, which contained only (but not all) species with hooked styles. Meissner's 1856 circumscription of B. sect. Eubanksia was as follows: :Banksia ::B. sect. Eubanksia :::B. ser. Abietinæ ::::B. pulchella ::::B. Meisneri ::::B. sphærocarpa :::::B. sphaerocarpa var. glabrescens (now B. incana) ::::B. pinifolia (now B. leptophylla) ::::B. nutans ::::B. ericifolia ::::B. spinulosa ::::B. tricuspis :::B. ser Salicinæ ::::B. cunninghamii (now B. spinulosa var. cunninghamii) ::::B. collina (now B. spinulosa var. collina) ::::B. occidentalis ::::B. littoralis ::::B. cylindrostachya (now B. attenuata) ::::B. lindleyana ::::B. marginata :::::B. marginata var.

Candolleana ::::B. dryandroides ::::B. Brownii ::B. sect. Isostylis (one species) The top-level split into Eubanksia and Isostylis was abandoned by George Bentham in 1870. Instead, Bentham divided the genus into five section, retaining B. sect. Isostylis, but dividing the remaining species into four sections. B. subg. Banksia sensu George In 1981, Alex George published a thorough revision of Banksia in his classic monograph The genus Banksia L.f. (Proteaceae). George reinstated Meissner's Eubanksia and Isostylis, giving them subgeneric rank. By this time, however, the rules of botanical nomenclature had been formalised in such a way that Eubanksia was required to take the autonym B. subg. Banksia. George's arrangement was overturned in 1996 by Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges, but in 1999 George published a slightly modified version in his treatment of Banksia for the Flora of Australia series of monographs. George's 1999 arrangement is not universally accepted, and accords poorly with recently published cladistic analyses, yet it remains the most recently published arrangement. In George's taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. subg. Banksia is further divided into three sections, primarily on the shape of the style. B. sect. Banksia species have a straight or curved, but never hooked, style; this section contains about 50 species that are further divided into nine series. B. sect. Coccinea contains a single species, Banksia coccinea. B. sect. Oncostylis contains those species whose styles are hooked; it contains about 20 species, which are further divided into four series. It is circumscribed as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. sect. Banksia ::::B. ser.

Isostylis (3 species) B. subg. Banksia sensu Thiele and Ladiges In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges published the results of a cladistic analysis of Banksia. They found George's arrangement to accord fairly closely with their inferred cladogram, so sought to publish a taxonomic arrangement that reflected their phylogeny whilst being minimally disruptive to the then-current arrangement. They accepted both of George's subgenera prior to the analysis, using each as an outgroup in the analysis of the other. Thus their analysis yielded little information about the circumscription and placement of B. subg. Banksia. They did find, however, that the subgenus was not monophyletic unless B. elegans (Elegant Banksia) was excluded. They ended up listing B. elegans and five other species as incertae sedis, but otherwise maintained George's circumscription of the subgenus. In Thiele and Ladiges' taxonomic arrangement of Banksia, B. subg. Banksia is divided into twelve series. Its placement and circumscription may be summarised as follows: :Banksia ::B. subg. Isostylis (three species) ::B. elegans (incertae sedis) ::B. subg. Banksia :::B. ser. Tetragonae ::::B. elderiana ::::B. lemanniana ::::B. caleyi ::::B. aculeata :::B. ser.

Dryandra B. subg. Banksia sensu Mast and Thiele In 2005, Austin Mast, Eric Jones and Shawn Havery published the results of their cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for Banksia. They inferred a phylogeny very greatly different from the accepted taxonomic arrangement, including finding Banksia to be paraphyletic with respect to Dryandra. A new taxonomic arrangement was not published at the time, but early in 2007 Mast and Thiele initiated a rearrangement by transferring Dryandra to Banksia, and publishing B. subg. Spathulatae for the species having spoon-shaped cotyledons. Thus B. subg. Banksia was redefined as containing the species lacking spoon-shaped cotyledons. Mast and Thiele have foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra is complete. References External links * subg. Banksia Category:Plant subgenera ","title":"Banksia subg.

It uses the Bengali script as its writing system. History and development Bishnupriya Manipuri is spoken in parts of Assam and Tripura in India, in the Sylhet region of Bangladesh, and in several other countries. It is different from many Indo-Aryan languages like Bengali, Oriya, etc. The language originated and developed in Manipur and was originally confined to the surroundings of the Loktak Lake and is similar to the Assamese language.\\"Mayang, one of the languages spoken in the polyglot state of Manipur, may, however, be classed as a dialect of this language.\\" – Imperial Gazetteer of India, Vol I, 1907 Other authorities such as An account of the valley of Manipore by Col.

Grierson refers to the language as \\"Bishnupuriya Manipuri\\", while some other writers call it simply \\"Bishnupriya\\". The language slowly started losing its ground in Manipur against a vast majority of Meiteis and is slowly facing its decay in Cachar and Bangladesh against a vast majority of Bengali-speakers. This language is still being spoken in Jiribam (a sub-division of Manipur),E-pao.net Cachar (a district of Assam) and in some pockets in Bangladesh and Tripura. Source and origin The language is known to its speakers as Imar Thar (), meaning \\"Language of my Mother.\\" They call themselves and their language Manipuri, and use the term Bishnupriya to distinguish them from other ethnic groups of Manipur. The term Bishnupriya is most probably derived from Bishnupur along with the suffix -iya, meaning \\"people of Bishnupur\\".Dr. K. P. Sinha. The Bishnupriya Manipuris and Their Language, Assam 1977,page 5,6 Orthodox Bishnupriyas hold that the language was carried over to Bishnupriya Manipuri by some immigrants from Dvārakā and Hastinapura just after the Mahabharata war. It is further said that these immigrants were led by Babhruvahana, the son of Chitrangada and Arjuna, the third Pandava. Some scholars and history writers came to support the Mahabharata origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri from observation of the morphology, the vocables, and the phonology of the Bishnupriya Manipuri language.Singha, Jagat Mohan & Singha, Birendra. The Bishnupriya Manipuris & Their Language. Silchar, 1976 They hold that BPM is highly influenced by Sanskrit and Maharastri as well as Sauraseni Prakrits. KP Sinha, who has done considerable research on Bishnupriya Manipuri, disagrees with the theory and is of the opinion that the language was originated through Magadhi Prakrita. It is found from his observations that the language has retained dominant characteristics of Magadhi. According to Sinha, pronouns and declensional and conjugational endings seem to be same as or closely related to those of Maithili, Oriya, Bengali. These forms of Oriya, Bengali are, on their parts, derived from Magadhi Apabhramsa coming from the Magadhi Prakrita.Dr. KP Sinha, An Etymological Dictionary of Bishnupriya Manipuri, Silchar, 1982 However, the Bishnupriya Manipuri language is certainly not one of the Tibeto-Burman languages, but is closer to the Indo-Aryan group of languages with remarkable influence from Meitei both grammatically and phonetically. At a different stage of development of the language the Sauraseni, Maharashtri and Magadhi languages and the Tibeto-Burman languages exerted influence on it as well. So it was probably developed from Sanskrit, Sauraseni-Maharashtri Prakrit and Magadhi Prakrita. The Sauraseni-Maharastri relation can be traced by observing some characteristics of pronouns. The Magadhi element is also remarkable, as the language retains many characteristics of Magadhi. It can further be noted that Bishnupriya Manipuri retains much of the old (15th century to 17th century A.D.) Meitei sound vocabulary, as the majority of speakers of the language, left Manipur during the first part of the 19th century.Tribals and their Culture in Manipur and Nagaland by G. K. Ghose. Page 167. Dialects Bishnupriya Manipuri has two dialects, namely Rajar Gang (\\"King's village\\") and Madai Gang (\\"Queen's village\\"). Unlike the dialects of other tribes, these dialects of Bishnupriya are not confined to distinct geographical areas. In Manipur, however, these two dialects were confined to well-defined territories. From the viewpoint of phonetics, Madai Gang is more akin to Assamese and Meitei, whereas Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. In vocabulary, Madai Gang is more influenced by Meitei and Assamese while Rajar Gang is more akin to Bengali. The morphological differences between the two dialects are negligible. Vocabulary Like other Indic languages, the core vocabulary of Bishnupriya Manipuri is made up of tadbhava words (i.e. words inherited over time from older Indic languages, including Sanskrit, including many historical changes in grammar and pronunciation), although thousands of tatsama words (i.e. words that were re-borrowed directly from Sanskrit with little phonetic or grammatical change) augment the vocabulary greatly. In addition, many other words were borrowed from languages spoken in the region either natively or as a colonial language, including Meitei, English, and Perso-Arabic. *Inherited/native Indic words (tadbhava): 10,000 (Of these, 2,000 are only found in Bishnupriya Manipuri, and have not been inherited by other Indic languages) *Words re-borrowed from Sanskrit (tatsama): 10,000 *Words re-borrowed from Sanskrit, partially modified (ardhatatsama): 1,500 *Words borrowed from Meitei: 3,500 *Words borrowed from other indigenous non- Indic languages (desi): 1,500 *Words borrowed from Perso-Arabic: 2,000 *Words borrowed from English: 700 *Hybrid words: 1,000 *Words of obscure origin: 1,300 Meitei elements in Bishnupriya Manipuri Bishnupriya Manipuri retains the old eighteen sounds of Meitei. Of them, there were three vowels, such as ɑ, i and u, thirteen consonants such as p, t, k, pʰ, tʰ, kʰ, c͡ʃ, m, n, ŋ, l, ʃ, h and two semi-vowels, such as w and j. In later stage nine more sounds added to Meitei but Bishnupriya is not concerned with them, because the Bishnupriyas left Manipur during 1st part of 19th century. That is why Bishnupriya Manipuri retains the older sounds of Meitei, whereas in Meitei itself the sound system has under-gone various changes.Dr. K.P. Sinha, The Bishnupriya Manipuri Language, Calcutta, 1981 The most distinctive influence of Maitei language over Bishnupriya manipuri is formation of words starting with vowel soung 'aung' such as , , . Connection with Assamese language Although there are numerous dissimilarities between Assamese and BPM, Dr. Suniti Kumar Chatterji, a recognised Bengali phonetician, listed the BPM language to be a dialect of Bengali, whereas Dr. Maheswer Neog and Dr. Banikanta Kakti claimed it as a dialect of indigenous Assamese. Their assumptions later caused contradiction about the origin of Bishnupriya Manipuri language. But the assumptions were proven incorrect by scientific research and observation of morphology, vocabulary, and phonology of BPM. Script The orthodox Bishnupriyas claim that they have their own script, that is, the Devanagari script, which was used to write in the Bishnupriya language in its early years. However, on introduction of modern education during the British period through the Bengali language the Bishnupriya Manipuri writers began to use the Bengali–Assamese script. This alphabet has consonant letters with dependent vowel signs (matras) as well as independent vowel letters. Punctuation marks and numerals are also used. Bishnupriya Manipuri is written from left to right and top to bottom, in the same manner as in English. Some of the consonants can combine with one another to make orthographic clusters (named conjuncts). * Vowel Signs: * Other diacritics: * Independent vowels: * Consonants: * Numbers: Speakers = Distribution = In Manipur the language is still spoken in the Jiribam subdivision. A large number of Bishnupriya Manipuri people settled in Assam ages ago, particularly in the Barak Valley. These people are counted as one of the major groups of people in the Cachar and Karimganj districts of Barak Valley. In Tripura, the Bishnupriya Manipuri population localities may be divided into a Dharmanagar sub-area, a Kailasahar sub-area, a Kamalpur sub-area, and a West Tripura sub- area. In Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh and Mizoram, there is a scattered Bishnupriya Manipuri population. Outside of India, Bangladesh has the largest Bishnupriya Manipuri population. The main localities are Sylhet, Moulbivazar, Habiganj and the Sunamganj district. As per records, there were also a considerable number of the Bishnupriyas Manipuris living in local cities like Mymensingh, Rangamati of the Chittagong Hill Tracts and also at Tezgaon, Manipuri-para in Dhaka, the capital city of Bangladesh. In Burma, the Bishnupriya Manipuri areas are probably Mandalay, Amarpura, etc. In case of the United States of America, Canada, Germany, Middle East, and Austria, there are a considerable number of Bishnupriya Manipuris settled there. = Statistics = *295,000 in Assam *121,000 in Tripura, Meghalaya, Arunachal Pradesh, Nagaland and Mizoram *1,457 in Manipur (Imphal, Bishnupur, Ningthoukhong) *5,000 in Manipur (Jiribam Subdivision)Cultural Heritage of North-East India/ Bidhan Singha,1999 *5,000 in New Delhi, West Bengal, Maharashtra, Jharkhand, Sikkim and other Indian states *40,000 in Bangladesh Literature =Ancient literature= A good stock of folk literatures of Bishnupriya Manipuri, which are older in origin, are handed down to this day through oral tradition. The ancient literature of Bishnupriya Manipuri is represented by folk stories, folk-songs, folk-poems, rhymes and proverbs. A rain-invoking song called Boron-dahanir Ela (, 1450–1600 A.D.) and a song relating to the conjugal life of Madai and Soralel known as Madai Soralel Ela (, 1500–1600 ) are sometimes considered the most important. The language of the songs are archaic and are replete with words of Tibeto-Burman origin. These two songs are very important for the study of the cultural and linguistic history of Bishnupriya Manipuri. Besides these, there are songs which are sung by women who work in the fields. Proverbs form another important part of BPM folk literature. =Modern literature= The Bishnupriya Manipuris have established the apex literary organisation of the community Nikhil Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Parishad (1955), Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Sabha, Bishnupriya Manipuri Sahitya Singlup, Pouri, Manipuri Theatre, and many other organisations to encourage literary activities among the people. Serious literary culture of the BPM language began during the 2nd quarter of 20th century. In fact, the history of Manipuri literature began in 1925 with the literary magazine Jagaran () edited by Falguni Singha who was a Bishnupriya Social worker; this magazine published articles both in Bishnupriya and Meitei. The Manipuris of Surma valley formed their first formal association, Surma Valley Manipuri Society (later called Surma Valley Manipuri Association) in 1934. The members included the Meiteis, the Bishnupriyas and the Pangals (Manipuri Muslims). From 1933 a number of journals, e.g. Manipuri (1933), Mekhali (1938) and Kshatryajyoti (1944), fostered nationalism as well literary and cultural activities. A branch of modern BPM poetic literature, namely Vaishnava Padavali, based on Vaishnava philosophy, deserves special mention.

The building was designed by architectural firm Perrott Lyon Timlock & Kesa and completed in 1977. History By the early 1970s, the tiny Pacific island nation the Republic of Nauru had large funds generated by the sale of phosphate. They established the Nauru Phosphate Royalties Trust (NPRT) to invest the profits in international real estate. The site on the corner of Exhibition Street and Little Collins Street in Melbourne was purchased by the NPRT in 1972 for A$19 million, for the construction of an investment office tower. The site included a number of older buildings facing Collins Street, and the development was proposed at a time of increasing concern at the loss of the historic buildings of the famed 'Paris End' of Collins Street. The long established Ogg's Chemist at 76-78 Collins, the adjacent terrace at 80 Collins, and the three storey Victorian terrace at 84 Collins were demolished by 1972, but attempts to purchase and demolish the exclusive Le Louvre boutique at 72-74 Collins Street (built in 1855) were stymied by the owner Lillian Wightman who refused to sell. The four storey 1960s Palmer House at 82 Collins between the two demolished buildings was also not purchased, leaving a pair of 'gaps' in Collins Street, which were paved and landscaped. The space where 78 - 80 Collins had been, flanked by roughly finished side walls of the remaining buildings, gave Nauru House an address of 80 Collins Street. When completed in 1977 it briefly became the tallest building in Melbourne; however, it was not tall enough to take the mantle as Australia's tallest building, with the strikingly similar, but taller MLC Centre in Sydney completed just a few months earlier. In 1978, Nauru House was surpassed by the first Collins Place tower (architect I.M. Pei) as the tallest building in Melbourne. Due to cracks and decay in the pebble finish of the concrete, all the exterior of the tower was encased in matte-gray aluminium in 1991. In the early 2000s, following decades of mismanagement, over-spending and spiralling loans from General Electric, estimated to amount to approximately A$227 million, the NPRT was forced to sell off its international assets. Nauru House was purchased by the Queensland Investment Corporation (QIC) in December 2004 for A$140 million . A large scale redevelopment of the site was first planned in 2008, with an office tower taller than Nauru House proposed between it and Collins Street, cantilevering over the remaining historic buildings. Thirty years after the original development, QIC was successful this time in purchasing Le Louvre at 72-74 Collins Street from Lillian's daughter Georgina Weir, and the business moved to South Yarra. QIC also bought and then demolished the 1960s office block at 82 Collins Street, creating the wide frontage to Collins Street that Nauru House had failed to create. The final design for the redevelopment by Woods Bagot architects was for a 35 level office tower with a front portion cantilevering out to a point setback 6m from Collins Street (and with only a 6m gap between it and Nauru House), a new podium with shops and an arcade, an 'infill' streetscape of shops on Collins Street, and a 300 room hotel facing Little Collins Street. Construction commenced in 2017, with completion due in 2020. The new tower is to be known as 80 Collins South Tower, and Nauru House as 80 Collins North Tower. In early 2019, the under-construction development was purchased by Dexus for a reported $1.4 billion. In December 2019, following reported structural issues, the Le Louvre building was reduced to a facade.

An effusive eruption is a type of volcanic eruption in which lava steadily flows out of a volcano onto the ground. There are two major groupings of eruptions: effusive and explosive. Effusive eruption differs from explosive eruption, wherein magma is violently fragmented and rapidly expelled from a volcano. Effusive eruptions are most common in basaltic magmas, but they also occur in intermediate and felsic magmas. These eruptions form lava flows and lava domes, each of which vary in shape, length, and width. Deep in the crust, gasses are dissolved into the magma because of high pressures, but upon ascent and eruption, pressure drops rapidly, and these gasses begin to exsolve out of the melt. A volcanic eruption is effusive when the erupting magma is volatile poor (water, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, and hydrogen fluoride), which suppresses fragmentation, creating an oozing magma which spills out of the volcanic vent and out into the surrounding area. The shape of effusive lava flows is governed by the type of lava (i.e. composition), rate and duration of eruption, and topography of the surrounding landscape.Marshak, Stephen. Essentials of geology. New York: W.W. Norton, 2013.Time-lapse video of Kilauea flank vent eruption, 2005 For an effusive eruption to occur, magma must be permeable enough to allow the expulsion of gas bubbles contained within it. If the magma is not above a certain permeability threshold, it cannot degas and will erupt explosively. Additionally, at a certain threshold, fragmentation within the magma can cause an explosive eruption. This threshold is governed by the Reynolds Number, a dimensionless number in fluid dynamics that is directly proportional to fluid velocity. Eruptions will be effusive if the magma has a low ascent velocity. At higher magma ascent rates, the fragmentation within the magma passes a threshold and results in explosive eruptions. Silicic magma also exhibits this transition between effusive and explosive eruptions, but the fragmentation mechanism differs. The 1912 Novarupta eruption and the 2003 Stromboli eruption both exhibited a transition between explosive and effusive eruption patterns.  Basaltic eruptions  Basaltic composition magmas are the most common effusive eruptions because they are not water saturated and have low viscosity. Most people know them from the classic pictures of rivers of lava in Hawaii. Eruptions of basaltic magma often transition between effusive and explosive eruption patterns. The behavior of these eruptions is largely dependent on the permeability of the magma and the magma ascent rate. During eruption, dissolved gasses exsolve and begin to rise out of the magma as gas bubbles. If the magma is rising slowly enough, these bubbles will have time to rise and escape, leaving a less buoyant magma behind that fluidly flows out. Effusive basalt lava flows cool to either of two forms, ʻaʻā or pāhoehoe. This type of lava flow builds shield volcanoes, which are numerous in Hawaii, and is how the island was and currently is being formed.  Silicic eruptions  Alaskan volcano Novarupta with an effused lava dome at the summit. Silicic magmas most commonly erupt explosively, but they can erupt effusively. These magmas are water saturated, and many orders of magnitude more viscous than basaltic magmas, making degassing and effusion more complicated. Degassing prior to eruption, through fractures in the country rock surrounding the magma chamber, plays an important role. Gas bubbles can begin to escape through the tiny spaces and relieve pressure, visible on the surface as vents of dense gas. The ascent speed of the magma is the most important factor controlling which type of eruption it will be. For silicic magmas to erupt effusively, the ascent rate must be 10^{-5}to 10^{-2} m/s, with permeable conduit walls, so that gas has time to exsolve and dissipate into the surrounding rock. If the flow rate is too fast, even if the conduit is permeable, it will act as though it is impermeable and will result in an explosive eruption. Silicic magmas typically form blocky lava flows or steep-sided mounds, called lava domes, because their high viscosity does not allow it to flow like that of basaltic magmas. When felsic domes form, they are emplaced within and on top of the conduit. If a dome forms and crystallizes enough early in an eruption, it acts as a plug on the system, denying the main mechanism of degassing. If this happens, it is common that the eruption will change from effusive to explosive, due to pressure build up below the lava dome.

If a player loses one character, regardless of their other character's vitality, he or she loses the match. A roll system similar to the one used in The King of Fighters is also present in Kizuna Encounter as well. Plot One year ago, King Leo had made and held the Battle of the Beast God tournament in order to see who was worthy enough to challenge and fight against him from within their own given time and opportunity. Nine fighters had entered the tournament upon sight and that each of them had battled against one another from within a strong and relentless manner, but in the end, Sho Hayate had proven to be the strongest warrior and that he had won the tournament while defeating both King Leo and his fake impersonator King Lion from within the finals of the competition. To seek revenge against Hayate and those who caused his humiliating downfall, King Leo has organized a second version of the Battle of the Beast God tournament, but this time, there's a new rule: teams of 2 people must work together from within this new tournament so that they can either ensure victory or face defeat. The competitors from last year's tournament have learned of King Leo's new tournament and that each of them have decided to join forces with each other on either friendly or temporary terms. With the exception of Carol Stanzack (who decides to skip the tournament in order to continue her gymnastics training) and Nicola Zaza (who's too busy in having to work on his latest scientific project), Hayate and the fighters from the previous tournament have returned for combat and that they're ready to face the latest challenge that's presented to them by King Leo. However, the previous fighters aren't the only ones from within this tournament, as two new challengers have entered into the fray as well and that they have their own reasons in participating from within King Leo's new competition. The gathered fighters must be ready and prepared to not only fight against each other and King Leo from within this tournament, but also, they must deal with an unknown threat that lies directly from within the shadows of this competition as well.

They formerly had their own genus, Heteroscelus.Pereira & Baker (2005), Banks et al. (2006) The old genus name means \\"different leg\\" in Greek, referring to the leg scales that differentiate the tattlers from their close relatives, the shanks. The species are: * Grey-tailed tattler, Tringa brevipes (formerly Heteroscelus brevipes) * Wandering tattler, Tringa incana (formerly Heteroscelus incanus) Tattlers resemble a common redshank (T. totanus) in shape and size, but not in color. Their upper parts, underwings, face and neck are greyish, and the belly and the weak supercilium are white, with some greyish streaking on the underside in breeding plumage. They have short yellowish legs and a bill with a pale base and dark tip.Hayman et al. (1986) Wandering tattler in breeding plumage Certain identification to species depends on details like the length of the nasal groove and scaling on the tarsus. Birds in breeding plumage can also (with some experience) be identified by the underside pattern: the grey-tailed tattler has fine barring on throat, breast and flanks only, which appear light grey from a distance; the rest of the underside is pure white. The wandering tattler has a coarser barring, still visible from quite far away, all the way from the throat to the undertail coverts. In non-breeding plumage, observers with much experience will note that the wandering tattler is an overall darker bird with very weak supercilia, whereas the grey-tailed tattler is lighter - particularly on the face, due to their stronger supercilia. Their normal calls also differ strongly; the grey-tailed tattler has a disyllabic whistle, whereas the wandering tattler has a rippling trill. But when they flee from the observer or are otherwise startled or excited, both species alike give a variety of longer or shorter alarm calls.Hayman et al. (1986), VanderWerf (2006) Tattlers are strongly migratory and winter in the tropics and subtropics on muddy and sandy coasts. These are not particularly gregarious birds and are seldom seen in large flocks except at roosts. These birds forage on the ground or water, picking up food by sight. They eat insects, crustaceans and other invertebrates. Their breeding habitat is stony riverbeds. They nest on the ground, but these waders will perch in trees and sometimes use old nests of other birds.

Since 1966, the land surrounding Shoalwater Bay has been under the ownership of the Australian Defence Force, for the purpose of military training exercises. Shoalwater Bay is also a noted dugong habitat and is part of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.Captain Cook's Journal during his first voyage round the world . James Cook. Chapter 8: \\"Exploration of East Coast of Australia\\". April 1770. The bay is bounded by the Torilla Peninsula to the west and the Warginburra Peninsula and Leicester and Townshend islands to the east. History The traditional inhabitants of Shoalwater Bay are the Darumbal people.The Darumbal (Tarumbul, Tharoombool) language region includes the city of Rockhampton extending south towards Raglan Creek and north towards the Styx River and inland along the Broad Sound Ranges. The first recorded European to sight Shoalwater Bay was British navigator James Cook on 28 May 1770. Cook referred to the entire region, from Cape Palmerston (south of Mackay) to Cape Townshend, including Shoalwater Bay, as the \\"Bay of Inlets\\", a name which is no longer in use. Cook bestowed the name \\"Shoalwater Bay\\" on the southeasternmost of these bays, a reference to the number of sandbars in the bay. Following Cook, Matthew Flinders conducted further exploration of Shoalwater Bay in 1802, landing on Akens Island (a small island on the western side of Shoalwater Bay) and exploring the head of the bay. Flinders described the land as such: > The hills are stony, but some of them are clothed with grass and wood, and > the pine grows in the gullies between them. The low land is sandy or stony, > but covered with wood & herbage. Fresh water stands in ponds at the foot of > the hills. Settlement of the Rockhampton region commenced in 1853. By 1860, vast areas of the Shoalwater Bay region has been claimed by settlers. This settlement resulted in the dispersal—often violently—of the traditional inhabitants of Shoalwater Bay, the Darumbal people. Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area An ASLAV from the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment at the Shoalwater Bay training area The Shoalwater Bay Military Training Area encompasses 4,545 km2, which includes the Warginburra Peninsula, the Torilla Peninsula east of the Stanage Bay Road, Townshend and Leicester Islands, and a sizable chunk of the Shoalwater Bay hinterland north of the village of Byfield. Suggestions that the Shoalwater Bay region be acquired for the purpose of a training ground first appeared in 1960. The army formally took control of the land on 1 July 1965; by the following year, the last landholder had vacated his property. The training area was used by troops who were deployed to the Vietnam War. In 2005 the federal government entered into a long-term agreement with the US over the use of Shoalwater Bay for military training purposes. Similar agreements over a shorter time span have been agreed to with the Singapore Ministry of Defence. Military exercises with team United States have aroused considerable controversy in the Rockhampton-Yeppoon area, due to the threat of environmental damage to the Shoalwater Bay region. In recent years, concern has been raised about the possibility of depleted uranium weaponry been used during training exercises at Shoalwater Bay.(6 June 2005). Mayor seeks depleted uranium reassurance. ABC News Online. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Peace activists protesting Exercise Talisman Saber were arrested in 2009. Support for a permanent US presence has been expressed by the former Rockhampton mayor, Brad Carter in 2011, and by current mayor, Margaret Strelow. 7 August 2017: \\"The Australian Navy has located a missing US military aircraft that crashed off Australia's east coast on Saturday, Defense Minister Marise Payne said in a statement Monday. Three US Marines have been missing since what the Marine Corps calls a \\"mishap\\" with an MV-22 aircraft. Twenty- three of the 26 personnel on board the aircraft were rescued, the Corps said.\\" Environment The bay contains one of the most important seagrass habitats in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. A plan of management for the bay's dugong population was released in 1997 to protect the dugong population and reduce impacts on the seagrass meadows. =Important Bird Area= A 483 km2 area of the bay and its surrounds, covering all the habitat types suitable for migratory waders, or shorebirds, has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports over 1% of the world populations of pied oystercatchers, Far Eastern curlews and grey-tailed tattlers, and over 1% of the East Asian – Australasian Flyway populations of bar-tailed godwits, Eurasian whimbrels and Terek sandpipers. It also contains populations of beach stone-curlews and mangrove honeyeaters.

Consisting mainly of then-out-of-print recordings by Allin with his early-era backing groups The Jabbers, The Scumfucs, and the Cedar Street Sluts, Hated in the Nation became Allin's first widespread international release. Since it is a compilation intended to both document Allin's early recording career up to that time and to attract new fans to his music, it is the only GG Allin title that has never gone out-of-print; according to his official website, it is also one of the most popular items in Allin's discography. Album history The release came about as Allin's notoriety was growing in New York and New England. ROIR Records president Neil Cooper had approached Mykel Board, Maximum RockNRoll columnist and owner of Siedboard World Enterprises, about the possibility of ROIR doing a GG Allin cassette, since Allin had already had friendly dealings with Board, stemming from Allin's contribution to a compilation album Board had compiled in 1981. Cooper wanted to do an all-live album with Allin, but by this time, Allin's appearances were already notorious for his stage antics which included attacking audience members, audience members pulling GG offstage and attacking him in retaliation, GG defecating onstage, and throwing his feces at the audience. The decision was made to compile tracks from Allin's back catalog when the live show to be recorded only lasted three songs. Allin discussed using recordings from the collection he and Peter Yarmouth had assembled when they created Black & Blue Records. The original plan was to use new studio and live recordings that would be done in New York. Entrusted with supervising the project, Board contacted Allin and then arranged a recording session with Shimmy Disc owner and producer Kramer at the latter's Noise New York studio, and a live date at The Cat Club in New York City. A band was then assembled that included Kramer on bass, Steve Dasinger from Board's own band Artless on drums, and J Mascis of Dinosaur Jr on lead guitar. The backing band would later be collectively named on the sleeve note as \\"The New York Superscum\\". On Monday, October 6th, 1986, according to Board's liner notes for Allin's posthumous studio album Brutality and Bloodshed for All (1993), Allin arrived at the studio carrying a big bottle of Jim Beam whiskey that was only about one-eighth full, and in a rather visibly disheveled condition from not having bathed or cut his hair in quite some time. The recording session doubled as a rehearsal for the night's performance; at the beginning of one of the new recordings, Allin is heard giving an instruction to the band on how many times to play a particular song's introduction. The session didn't go completely without a hitch, however, as Allin reportedly broke one of the studio microphones by headbutting it and then, in Board's words, \\"tried to break the studio floor with his head.\\" After the recording session/rehearsal concluded, Allin, Board, and the band then went to the Cat Club for the evening's performance, which would also be recorded. A few hours before the show, GG met up with Peter Yarmouth and his bodyguard Don Schlock as both came up to NYC for the show, walked around the lower east side and visited David Peel. As Yarmouth was a big fan of Peel in the 70's and wanted to meet him, they went to Peel's apartment, but the meeting ended with Peel and GG arguing. As they left, Allin and Schlock urinated on Peel's apartment door in response. Schlock dared GG to defecate on stage, and GG bought some Ex-Lax at a deli while Schlock ordered a tongue sandwich. Schlock, while eating, told GG he would pay him $20 if he took a dump onstage. Yarmouth and Schlock along with GG then proceeded to the club, with none of them knowing this show would be the show that kicked GG's infamous career off. Before the group's set began, Allin reportedly told Board \\"It should be a good show tonight - I just ate an entire box of Ex-Lax.\\" GG was running in place as he waited for the show to start to keep it in. Predictably, the show itself came to a halt when Allin began it by defecating onstage before the set began, wearing only a jockstrap and dog collar. Two songs into the performance, GG began to toss his feces into the audience and hit a fan in the head with the microphone stand, with the club's owner ordering the bouncers to remove Allin from the club. After GG rubbed himself with the feces, most of the bouncers refused to toss him out. As a result of these antics, the set was only 3 songs long: only those songs from the live performance, \\"Blood For You\\", \\"Ass Fuckin' Butt Lickin' Cunt Suckin' Masturbation\\" and \\"Eat My Shit\\", were usable enough for the album. The other cuts with the New York Superscum - new recordings of \\"Drink Fight And Fuck\\" and a \\"new\\" cut (apparently improvised) entitled \\"Ten Year Old Fuck\\" - were done during the recording/rehearsal session. This Cat Club show was reported in The Village Voice and it got a lot of mileage for GG as he was in the letters section of that publication for a month or more. The rest of the underground/punk music press started paying a lot more attention to GG (most of it trashing him, not praising him). Yarmouth later said \\"I can not think of a show that had more impact on his career\\". To further simulate a live performance, Board used stage monologues from a cassette recording of a 1985 performance Allin had done in Dallas, Texas with a local pickup band called The Texas Nazis. The full recording would later be released by Black & Blue Records as Boozin' And Pranks along with other Black & Blue recordings Yarmouth agreed Allin could use. Messages from Allin's answering machine also appear on the album, as does a message left by Allin on Board's own machine. [Actually, all the messages were from MY answering machine. The other info is correct.-- Mykel Board] In 1998, ROIR reissued Hated in the Nation on compact disc, adding a radio commercial for Allin's first album Always Was, Is And Always Shall Be and three other cuts from the same era covered on the original cassette.

Family His father was Nathaniel Okafor Edozien a direct descendant of Nnebisi the founder of Asaba, and one of the most senior indigenous officials of the Nigerian Coal Corporation in Enugu. His mother, Nwakuso Edozien née Odogwu, was the daughter of a prominent Asaba chief, and a notable trader. Education His father sent him at an early age to live with an uncle who was a school master in Warri, Delta State then Bendel State, Nigeria. He attended the Catholic School in Warri from 1933 to 1937. He attended Christ the Kings College, Onitsha for his secondary education from 1938 to 1942. In 1942 he attended the Higher College Yaba and then proceeded to Achimota School, Accra, Ghana. His university education began with an admission to the University College Dublin, Ireland in 1944. He completed his BSc with honours in Physiology from the National University of Ireland in 1948, MSc in Physiology in 1950, Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Chemotherapy (MBBCh) in 1954. He won several academic awards in the process. Career His academic career began with an appointment as a lecturer in Clinical Biochemistry in Middlesex Hospital Medical School, University of London in 1951. In 1952 he was appointed as a Senior Lecturer in Chemical Pathology at the University College, Ibadan. He returned to Ibadan after further studies in Ireland. In 1955 he married Modupe Smith a radiographer at the University of Ibadan teaching hospital. Her father was one of the first indigenous managers of the United Africa Company and her maternal grandfather was Herbert Macaulay, Nigeria's first surveyor and one of the principal actors in Nigeria's independence movement. The late colonial and early independence period were exciting times in Nigeria. Educated Nigerians rapidly occupied positions of responsibility in politics, commerce and academia. Everyone's hopes were high that in a short time the country would bridge the gap with the more developed countries of Europe and North America. The euphoric mood permeated the University of Ibadan, and Edozien's groundbreaking research in nutrition helped win it a reputation as a rising academic centre. He was appointed a professor in 1961 and became the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine in 1962. Exile Edozien's career at Ibadan ended in 1967, a casualty of the political crisis that ended the euphoria of the late 1950s and early 1960s and resulted in the coups of 1966 and eventually led to the Nigerian Civil War. In 1967 he was instrumental in the efforts to establish the University of Benin in the newly created Midwestern Region of Nigeria. He was also implicated in the plots that resulted in the Biafran invasion of the Midwestern Region at the beginning of the civil war and was forced to flee the country. After a period as a refugee in France, he was appointed as a professor of Nutrition at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA. In 1971 he became a professor and head of Department of Nutrition, of the School of Public Health of the University of North Carolina. Nigeria In 1990 Edozien was appointed the Chairman of the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research. Shortly thereafter he was selected to become the 13th Asagba of Asaba. He retired as a Professor Emeritus of the University of North Carolina and returned to Nigeria in 1991. Edozien's tenure as the Asagba of Asaba has coincided with dramatic changes in the character of the town. When the government of President Ibrahim Babangida created Delta State out of the old Bendel State, Asaba was chosen as the capital. Its new status as the seat of the state government has brought much of the chaotic development associated with contemporary Nigerian urbanization. The population of the town has grown and the influx of non-Asaba indigenes has strained the traditional institutions of the town. A central theme of Edozien's tenure as the Asagba has been the challenge balancing rapid development, modernization of traditional norms and institutions with preservation of the positive aspects and moderating influence of traditional values. Several on-going initiatives such as the Asaba permanent palace and civic centre and the documentation of the town's traditional laws and customs have sought to balance these concerns. Edozien remains an important figure in modern-day Nigerian affairs. President Olusegun Obasanjo conferred the national honour of Commander of the Federal Republic on him in 2003. He also remains one of the most respected traditional rulers who encourage and promote mutual coexistence, especially between the people in the south and Northern Nigeria. He is also the Chancellor of the Federal University of Agriculture, Abeokuta.

During this period, the country was thrown into turmoil by the Yellow Turban Rebellion (184–205). Meanwhile, the Han Empire's institutions were destroyed by the warlord Dong Zhuo, and fractured into regional regimes ruled by various warlords, some of whom were nobles and officials of the Han imperial court. Eventually, one of those warlords, Cao Cao, was able to gradually reunify the empire, ostensibly under Emperor Xian's rule, but the empire was actually controlled by Cao Cao himself. Cao Cao's efforts to completely reunite the Han dynasty were rebuffed at the Battle of Red Cliffs in 208 / 209, when his armies were defeated by the allied forces of Sun Quan and Liu Bei. The Han dynasty formally ended in 220 when Cao Cao's son and heir, Cao Pi, pressured Emperor Xian into abdicating in his favour. Cao Pi became the emperor of a new state, Cao Wei. A year later, in response to Cao Pi's usurpation of the Han throne, Liu Bei declared himself emperor of Shu Han; and in 229, Sun Quan followed suit, declaring himself emperor of Eastern Wu. The period from the fall of the Han dynasty in 220 to the partial reunification of China under the Jin dynasty in 265 was known as the Three Kingdoms era in Chinese history.  Collapse of imperial authority (184–191)  = Yellow Turban Rebellion and decentralisation (184–189) = Map showing the Yellow Turban Rebellion. Towards the end of the reign of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189), many officials in the imperial court foresaw chaos in the political scene as soon as Emperor Ling died. One of those officials, Liu Yan, suggested to Emperor Ling in 188 that the root of the agrarian revolts during that time, including the most serious Yellow Turban Rebellion of 184, was that Inspectors (刺史) lacked substantial administrative powers. Emperor Ling, convinced by Liu Yan, changed the Inspectors' titles to \\"Governor\\" (牧) and granted them the authority to levy taxes and command armed forces within the borders. Liu Yan was commissioned as the Governor of Yi Province (covering the Sichuan Basin), while several other important officials also became Governors, including Liu Yu, who was appointed Governor of You Province (covering present-day northern Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin and Liaoning). The increased influence of these provincial governors formed the basis on which later warlords would control large regions of the Han empire. Eastern Han incense burner and bronze sculpture in the shape of a duck = Imperial power struggle (189) = Emperor Ling died in 189 and was succeeded by his 13-year-old son, Liu Bian (born to Empress He), who became known as Emperor Shao. Empress He, now empress dowager, became regent to the young emperor, while her older brother, General-in-Chief He Jin, became the most powerful official in the imperial court. He Jin and Yuan Shao plotted to exterminate all the Ten Attendants, a group of ten influential eunuch officials in the court, but Empress Dowager He disapproved of their plan. In a fateful move, He Jin summoned Dong Zhuo, a warlord controlling the battle-tested Liang Province (涼州; covering present-day Gansu), to march on the capital Luoyang to threaten Empress Dowager He into eliminating the Ten Attendants. After the eunuchs discovered He Jin's plot, they lured him into the palace and murdered him (22 September 189). In response, Yuan Shao led the imperial guards on an indiscriminate massacre of the palace eunuchs. The surviving eunuchs kidnapped Emperor Shao and his younger brother, the eight-year-old Prince of Chenliu (raised by his grandmother Empress Dowager Dong), and fled north towards the Yellow River, but were finally forced to commit suicide by throwing themselves into the river. Dong Zhuo arrived on the scene and found Emperor Shao and the Prince of Chenliu. The young emperor appeared nervous and fearful, while the prince remained calm and composed, and gave orders to Dong Zhuo to escort them back to the palace. Dong Zhuo used the opportunity to seize control of state power and bring his army into the capital. Not long later, Dong Zhuo deposed Emperor Shao and replaced him with the Prince of Chenliu, who became known as Emperor Xian. Dong Zhuo dominated the imperial court and named himself \\"Chancellor of State\\" (相國), a title not held by anyone since the Western Han dynasty statesman Xiao He; Dong Zhuo also granted himself the privilege of attending court without needing to disarm himself or remove his shoes. = Resistance against Dong Zhuo (189–191) = An Eastern Han prancing horse, bronze sculpture, 2nd century In the spring of 190, several provincial officials and warlords formed a coalition against Dong Zhuo, claiming that he was set on usurping the throne and had effectively kidnapped Emperor Xian. Yuan Shao, Administrator of Bohai (around present-day Cangzhou, Hebei), was nominated to be the leader of the coalition. The coalition armies was stationed at Henei (河內; in present-day Jiaozuo, Henan) and appeared to be ready to move on the capital Luoyang. However, the coalition was actually rather disorganized, and Yuan Shao did not have effective command over the entire alliance. Besides, the coalition members were also hesitant to directly confront Dong Zhuo and his strong Liang Province military. Still, Dong Zhuo was anxious and chose to move the capital to Chang'an in the west to avoid the coalition. About a month later, Dong Zhuo forced Emperor Xian and the imperial court to move to Chang'an, along with Luoyang's residents, and in the process, he ordered the former capital to be destroyed by fire. During the move, Dong Zhuo remained near Luoyang, ready to resist any coalition attacks on him. In 191, the coalition tried to further de-legitimize Dong Zhuo's position by offering to enthrone Liu Yu, who was eligible to be Emperor since he was a member of the royal clan. Liu Yu remained faithful to Emperor Xian and firmly declined to take the throne. As the coalition members continued to bicker over battle plans, a minor general under Yuan Shu, Sun Jian, took a calculated risk and attacked Dong Zhuo directly near Luoyang. After scoring a number of victories over Dong Zhuo's forces, Sun Jian eventually forced Dong to retreat to Chang'an, and Luoyang came under the coalition's control. For the following months until the end of 191, the coalition ceased to take further action against Dong Zhuo, and eventually disbanded and the members returned to their respective bases. Soon, a number of officials started having thoughts of controlling and ruling over their own territories like kings. The most prominent warlords who emerged at that time included: * Yuan Shao, who seized control of Ji Province (covering present-day central and southern Hebei and northern Henan) from Han Fu in 191 * Liu Yan, who controlled Yi Province * Liu Biao, who controlled Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) * Yuan Shu, Yuan Shao's half-brother (cousin in name), who controlled the area south of the Huai River (covering present-day northern and central Anhui) However, in addition to these greater warlords, in time the entire Han empire virtually fractured into small blocs, each controlled by a local warlord.  Dong Zhuo's death and continued warfare (192–196)  Map showing major Chinese warlords in the 190s. An Eastern Han stone-carved tomb guardian (Tianlu); City Museum of Luoyang = Dong Zhuo's death and aftermath (192) = After Dong Zhuo withdrew to Chang'an, he maintained an even tighter grip on the government and cruelly dealt with all dissent against him. Interior Minister Wang Yun and a few other officials, including Huang Wan (黃琬), Shisun Rui (士孫瑞), and Yang Zan (楊瓚), plotted to eliminate Dong Zhuo. They eventually persuaded Dong Zhuo's foster son, Lü Bu, to join them. Lü Bu bore a grudge against Dong Zhuo because the latter almost killed him once during a fit of anger, and also because he was afraid that his secret affair with one of Dong Zhuo's maids might be exposed. In May 192, the conspirators, led by Lü Bu and Wang Yun, assassinated Dong Zhuo and slaughtered his clan. After Dong Zhuo's death, it was believed that the chaos caused by Dong Zhuo's \\"reign of terror\\" would subside, and the central government would be restored to its original state. However, although Wang Yun was regarded as a capable minister, he gradually became arrogant and made several key mistakes that would cause his downfall. He failed to maintain good relations with Lü Bu, and strongly refused to grant amnesty to the surviving followers of Dong Zhuo and ordered them to be disbanded. This caused Dong Zhuo's men to fear that they might be massacred. Dong Zhuo's son-in-law, Niu Fu, took control of Dong's forces in Liang Province and resisted Wang Yun, but later died in a friendly fire incident. Niu Fu's subordinates, Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou, wanted to submit to the imperial court, but as they had previously resisted Wang Yun, Wang now rejected their request for amnesty. Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou led their armies to attack Chang'an and took control of the government. Wang Yun was captured and executed along with his family, while Lü Bu was defeated and driven away. = Continued warfare (193–196) = After taking control over the imperial court in Chang'an, Li Jue, Guo Si and Fan Chou did as they pleased without showing any regard for the welfare of the state. Concurrently, provincial warlords all over China battled each other to expand their territories or further their personal interests. Some of those warlords were friendly with Li Jue's forces, while others remained hostile to them, even though all of them nominally acknowledged Emperor Xian as the sovereign ruler of China. In 193, armed conflict broke out between the northern warlords Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan. Liu Yu strongly opposed warfare while Gongsun Zan continuously waged war against Yuan Shao. Liu Yu and Gongsun Zan made accusations against each other in their respective memorials to Emperor Xian. Eventually, Liu Yu was unable to tolerate Gongsun Zan and attacked the latter, but was defeated and killed. In 195, turmoil ensued in Chang'an when Li Jue and Guo Si killed Fan Chou together, and later turned against each other. Li Jue held Emperor Xian hostage while Guo Si kidnapped the imperial officials, and both sides engaged in battle. Later that year, Li Jue and Guo Si made peace and agreed to allow Emperor Xian to return to the old capital, Luoyang, but later regretted their decision and pursued him. While Li Jue and Guo Si were never able to capture Emperor Xian again, the imperial court was rendered poor and unable to fend for itself. As Luoyang had been previously devastated by fire during Dong Zhuo's time, the city lacked the basic essentials of life and many officials starved to death or resorted to cannibalism. Around this time, Ju Shou suggested to Yuan Shao to welcome Emperor Xian to his province so that he could take effective control of the government. However, Guo Tu and Chunyu Qiong opposed Ju Shou's view, claiming that if Yuan Shao brought Emperor Xian to his territory, he would need to yield to the emperor on key decisions and follow proper court protocol. Yuan Shao remained hesitant and did not come to a conclusion on whether to receive the emperor or not.  Gradual reunification under Cao Cao (196–207)  =Cao Cao's use of Emperor Xian as titular authority= While Yuan Shao was still indecisive on whether to welcome Emperor Xian or not, Cao Cao took advantage of the situation to bring the emperor to his territory. At that time, Cao Cao was still a relatively minor warlord, with only Yan Province (兗州; covering present-day western Shandong and eastern Henan) under his control. In 196, Cao Cao led his army towards Luoyang. He encountered Dong Cheng and Yang Feng (who were shielding Emperor Xian from Li Jue and Guo Si), convinced them of his loyalty, and was allowed to meet the emperor. In name, Cao Cao was sharing power with the other officials and nobles, but actually he was in control, but yet he ensured that the officials and nobles were treated with due respect, hence he faced minimal opposition in the imperial court. Later, Cao Cao escorted the emperor back to his base in Xu (許; present-day Xuchang, Henan), establishing the new capital there. From then on, although Cao Cao was a subject of Emperor Xian in name, he actually wielded state power and controlled the imperial court. Despite so, Cao Cao never showed disrespect to Emperor Xian, and instead, honoured the emperor according to formal imperial protocol. Cao Cao also issued imperial edicts in Emperor Xian's name to other warlords, ordering them to submit to imperial authority when in fact they were actually submitting to him. When Cao Cao sent Yuan Shao an edict in the emperor's name, only then did Yuan realize that he had lost an opportunity to make use of the emperor to control other warlords. = Cao Cao's rise to power (196–199) = An Eastern Han glazed ceramic cosmetics box with zoomorphic feet Even after moving to the new capital at Xu, the central government still lacked funds and food supplies. As suggested by Zao Zhi (棗祇), Cao Cao implemented a new tuntian policy to promote agricultural production, in which soldiers were sent to grow crops, and the harvest would be shared between the military and civilian population. The policy yielded commendable results as the area around Xu developed into highly productive farmland and the problem of shortage of food was resolved. At this time, the most prominent warlords in China were: * Yuan Shao, who controlled Ji, Bing and Qing provinces (covering most of present-day Hebei, Shanxi and Shandong). Some of the territories were governed by Yuan Shao's three sons (Yuan Tan, Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang) and nephew (Gao Gan). * Yuan Shu, who controlled most of present-day Anhui and parts of Jiangsu * Gongsun Zan, who controlled You Province, including present-day Beijing, Tianjin and western Liaoning * Liu Biao, who controlled Jing Province (covering present-day Hubei and Hunan) * Liu Zhang, who controlled Yi Province (covering the Sichuan Basin) * Lü Bu, who seized control of Xu Province (covering present-day northern Jiangsu) from its previous governor Liu Bei There were still many other minor warlords, and Cao Cao particularly sought to get them to submit to him. In 197, Zhang Xiu surrendered Wancheng to Cao Cao. However, Cao Cao later had an affair with Zhang Xiu's widowed aunt, angering Zhang. Zhang, who learned of Cao Cao's planned assassination on his life, rebelled and launched a surprise attack on Cao Cao at Wancheng. In this battle, Cao Cao's eldest son Cao Ang, nephew Cao Anmin, and bodyguard Dian Wei were killed, and Cao Cao himself narrowly escaped from death. On the advice of Jia Xu, Zhang Xiu eventually surrendered to Cao Cao in the winter of 199–200. In addition, in 197, Cao Cao was able to persuade Ma Teng and Han Sui, who controlled Yong and Liang provinces (covering most of present-day Shaanxi and Gansu), to submit to him. That year, Yuan Shu declared himself \\"Son of Heaven\\" in Shouchun (壽春; present-day Shou County, Anhui), an act perceived as treason against the Han dynasty government, prompting other warlords to use that as an excuse to attack him (see Campaign against Yuan Shu). Sun Ce, son of Sun Jian, who had conquered several territories in Jiangdong between 194 and 199, ended his alliance with Yuan Shu and became an independent warlord. Lü Bu, who was also previously Yuan Shu's ally, broke ties with Yuan and dealt him a major defeat near Shouchun. Cao Cao also attacked Yuan Shu and defeated him. Yuan Shu attempted to flee north to join Yuan Shao but his way was blocked and he would die of illness on his return to Shouchun in 199. In 198, Yuan Shao tried to persuade Cao Cao to move the capital to Juancheng (鄄城; in present-day Heze, Shandong), which was nearer to his own territory, in an attempt to wrestle Emperor Xian away from Cao, but Cao refused. Later that year, Cao Cao joined forces with Liu Bei to attack Lü Bu, defeating him at the Battle of Xiapi. Lü Bu was captured and executed on Cao Cao's order, and Xu Province came under Cao's control. In 199, Gongsun Zan was defeated by Yuan Shao at the Battle of Yijing and he committed suicide by setting himself on fire. Gongsun Zan's territories, which extended to the northern boundaries of the Han dynasty's empire, were completely annexed by Yuan Shao. Yuan Shao then turned his attention south towards Cao Cao, who was an emerging power in central China. Yuan formed an alliance with Liu Biao and was intent on attacking Cao Cao. = Guandu campaign (200–201) = Cao Cao's conquests from the Yuan clan 200–207 Against the advice of Ju Shou and Tian Feng, who reasoned that their troops were exhausted after the battles against Gongsun Zan and needed rest, Yuan Shao prepared for a campaign against Cao Cao, confident that his much larger army could easily crush Cao Cao's. While Cao Cao readied himself for battle, he discovered that Dong Cheng, Liu Bei and a few other officials were conspiring against him. In early 200, Liu Bei used an opportunity to break away from Cao Cao and seize control of Xu Province, after killing Cao Cao's appointed governor of the province, Che Zhou (車冑). On the other hand, Dong Cheng and the others were making plans to assassinate Cao Cao. However, the plot was exposed and all the conspirators in the capital were massacred along with their families. Cao Cao then took a risk by attacking Liu Bei in Xu Province, leaving his flank open to attacks from Yuan Shao. However, Cao Cao made a right choice because Yuan Shao did not heed Tian Feng's urging to seize the chance to attack him. Liu Bei was defeated and he fled north to join Yuan Shao. Liu Bei's general Guan Yu surrendered to Cao Cao and temporarily served under Cao. Only after Liu Bei's defeat did Yuan Shao start implementing his plan to attack Cao Cao, but this time Tian Feng opposed his decision, saying that their opportunity had passed. Yuan Shao became annoyed with Tian Feng and had Tian imprisoned, after which he led his army south to attack Cao Cao. At the Battle of Boma, Yuan Shao's general Yan Liang was slain by Guan Yu while another of Yuan's generals, Wen Chou, was killed in action against Cao Cao's forces. The morale of Yuan Shao's army was greatly affected by the loss of the two generals. By late 200, the armies of Yuan Shao and Cao Cao finally clashed at Guandu (官渡; in present-day Zhengzhou, Henan), south of the Yellow River. Yuan Shao had two advantages over Cao Cao - numerical superiority and greater amount of supplies, but Cao Cao's troops were better trained than his. After some minor skirmishes, both sides became locked in a stalemate, until Cao Cao personally led a small detachment on a surprise attack on Yuan Shao's supply depot at Wuchao, which was defended by Chunyu Qiong. Instead of sending reinforcements to Wuchao, Yuan Shao sent Zhang He and Gao Lan (高覽) to attack Cao Cao's camp, but was unsuccessful. The fall of Wuchao dealt a major blow to the morale of Yuan Shao's army, which was subsequently routed by Cao Cao's forces. Yuan Shao fled north of the Yellow River while most of his troops were either killed or surrendered to Cao Cao. From that point on, although Yuan Shao continued to remain as a major power player, he could no longer challenge Cao Cao's growing supremacy. The latter destroyed the defeated the remaining Yuan troops south of the Yellow River in the Battle of Cangting (201), concluding the Guandu campaign. = Fall of the Yuan power bloc (202–207) = Late Eastern Han mural showing chariots and cavalry, from the Dahuting tombs After Yuan Shao died of illness in 202, a struggle of succession developed between his oldest son Yuan Tan and third son Yuan Shang. Several years before Yuan Shao's death, based on the traditional order of succession, Yuan Tan should have been designated as the heir apparent, but as Yuan Shao's wife Lady Liu favoured Yuan Shang, so Yuan Shao had Yuan Tan posthumously adopted by the latter's uncle, Yuan Cheng (袁成). Yuan Shao then divided his territories between his sons and nephew Gao Gan, ostensibly so that he could determine their abilities. His base of Ji Province was given to Yuan Shang, Yuan Tan controlled Qing Province, while Yuan Xi governed You Province, and Gao Gan ruled Bing Province. On his deathbed, Yuan Shao did not leave any explicit instruction as to who should succeed him. Of Yuan Shao's followers, Pang Ji and Shen Pei supported Yuan Shang, while Xin Ping and Guo Tu favoured Yuan Tan. After Yuan Shao's death, most of his subordinates initially wanted Yuan Tan to be their new lord, since he was the oldest son. However, Shen Pei and Pang Ji forged a will, naming Yuan Shang as the successor. Yuan Tan was furious and mobilized his forces under the pretext of attacking Cao Cao, drawing Cao's attention, and Cao preemptively retaliated. Yuan Shang came to his oldest brother's aid, and they fought inconclusively against Cao Cao in the Battle of Liyang. In 203, Cao Cao scored a major victory over the Yuans, who retreated back to Ji Province's capital, Ye (鄴). Cao Cao then planned to besiege Ye, but later withdrew his forces after heeding Guo Jia's advice. Guo Jia reasoned that if Cao Cao pressured the Yuans, they might unite against a common enemy; however, if Cao Cao retreated, the disgruntled Yuan brothers would start fighting among themselves. Guo Jia's prediction came true later when Yuan Tan, still bearing a grudge against Yuan Shang for receiving a larger inheritance, attacked Yuan Shang, but his forces in Qing Province defected to Yuan Shang. Yuan Tan fled to Pingyuan (in present-day Dezhou, Shandong) and was besieged by Yuan Shang there. Yuan Tan sought help from Cao Cao, and Cao advanced north to attack Ye, forcing Yuan Shang to lift the siege on Pingyuan. In early 204, Yuan Shang incorrectly believed that Cao Cao had withdrawn, so he attacked his brother again at Pingyuan. Cao Cao attacked Ye once more and Yuan Shang headed back to defend his base, but was defeated by Cao Cao. Yuan Shang then fled north to Zhongshan (in present-day Shijiazhuang, Hebei), and Ye fell to Cao Cao. Gao Gan also surrendered Bing Province to Cao Cao. During Cao Cao's siege on Ye, Yuan Tan did not help attack Ye but sought to take Yuan Shang's territories, defeating Yuan Shang in Zhongshan. Yuan Shang fled further north to join Yuan Xi in You Province. Cao Cao now accused Yuan Tan of breaching the trust in the alliance so he turned east to attack him, capturing Yuan Tan's last stronghold at Nanpi (南皮; in present-day Cangzhou, Hebei) and killing Yuan. Meanwhile, in You Province, Yuan Xi's subordinate Jiao Chu (焦觸) revolted and surrendered to Cao Cao, forcing Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang to flee further north to join the Wuhuan tribes under chief Tadun. Around this time, Gao Gan also rebelled against Cao Cao, but was defeated by 206 and killed while attempting to flee south to join Liu Biao. In 207, Cao Cao's army headed north to attack the Wuhuan, defeating them at the Battle of White Wolf Mountain. Tadun was killed in battle while Yuan Xi and Yuan Shang sought refuge under Gongsun Kang, a warlord who controlled most of present-day Liaoning. Gongsun Kang feared that the Yuans might turn against him and seize his territory, so he had them executed and sent their heads to Cao Cao. By this time, the Yuan clan had been completely eliminated and much of northern China had been reunified under Cao Cao's control. = Developments in southern China (194–208) = During his reunification of northern China, Cao Cao did not conduct any major campaigns south while awaiting an opportunity to act against the remaining three most prominent warlords: Sun Quan, who had succeeded his older brother Sun Ce after the latter died in 200; Liu Biao, governor of Jing Province; and Liu Zhang, governor of Yi Province. During that time, Sun Quan was developing his territories in Jiangdong, and strengthening his military forces. In 208, Sun Quan defeated and killed Liu Biao's vassal Huang Zu at the Battle of Jiangxia, seizing most of Huang's territory at Jiangxia (江夏; present-day Xinzhou District, Wuhan, Hubei). While Cao Cao was attacking the Yuan clan in northern China, Liu Bei fled south to join Liu Biao and became a vassal under the latter, who stationed him at the northern border in Xinye County to keep Cao Cao at bay. An initial Cao attack on Liu Bei was repelled during the Battle of Bowang (202).  Red Cliffs campaign (208–209)  Eastern Han ceramic figurine of a soldier with a missing spear = Cao Cao's invasion of Jing Province (208) = In 208, Cao Cao launched a southern campaign to conquer Liu Biao's Jing Province. Liu Biao was ill and dying, when a succession struggle broke out between his sons Liu Qi and Liu Cong. After Huang Zu's defeat, Liu Qi was appointed by Liu Biao as Administrator of Jiangxia, which was previously governed by Huang. Liu Cong, who was favoured by Liu Biao's second wife Lady Cai (because he married her niece), remained in Jing Province's capital, Xiangyang. Liu Cong became the new Governor of Jing Province after his father's death. Fearing that he might be caught in a war on two fronts (Cao Cao in the north and Liu Qi in the southeast), Liu Cong surrendered to Cao Cao, and most of Jing Province came under Cao Cao's control. Liu Bei was unwilling to submit to Cao Cao and fled south. Along the way, one of Cao Cao's light cavalry units caught up with Liu Bei's retreating forces (which included civilians) and defeated them at the Battle of Changban. Liu Bei escaped with his life and fled to Dangyang (當陽; in present-day Yichang, Hubei). In Jiangdong, Sun Quan felt threatened by Cao Cao's approaching army and sent Lu Su to discuss forming an alliance with Liu Bei and Liu Qi against Cao Cao. Cao Cao wrote Sun Quan a letter, intended to intimidate the latter into submitting. Cao Cao's army was estimated to be 220,000 men strong, although Cao himself claimed that he had 800,000 troops. Sun Quan had 30,000 men at most while Liu Bei and Liu Qi's combined forces totaled about 10,000. In view of Cao Cao's overwhelming forces, many of Sun Quan's followers, including Zhang Zhao, strongly advocated surrender. However, Sun Quan refused as he agreed with Zhou Yu and Lu Su's view that Cao Cao might not let him off even if he submitted. By late 208, with help from Zhou Yu and Lu Su (and Zhuge Liang, who represented Liu Bei in the diplomatic exchange), an alliance was formed between Sun Quan and Liu Bei against Cao Cao. = Battle of Red Cliffs (208) = Sun Quan put Zhou Yu in command of his 30,000 troops, largely stationed on naval vessels. Zhou Yu set up a defensive position in conjunction with Liu Bei, whose army garrisoned on land. Around this time, a spreading plague significantly weakened Cao Cao's forces. Zhou Yu's subordinate Huang Gai pretended to defect to Cao Cao's side and was accepted by the latter. Huang Gai brought with him a small group of men and they sailed towards Cao Cao's base on boats. As the boats approached Cao Cao's fleet, Huang Gai ordered his men to set the boats on fire, and the burning boats crashed into Cao Cao's larger ships. The fire spread out of control and completely destroyed Cao Cao's entire naval fleet. Cao Cao's land forces at Wulin (烏林; in present-day Honghu, Hubei) were also attacked and driven back by Sun Quan and Liu Bei's armies. Cao Cao suffered a drastic defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs and was forced to retreat north back to Jiangling (江陵, located in present-day Jingjiang 荆江, not to be confused with present-day Jiangling County, Hubei).  Emergence of the Three Kingdoms (209–220)  Late Han Luoyang tomb fresco showing chariots, horses and men = Sun–Liu conquest of Jing Province (209–210) = Immediately after the Battle of Red Cliffs, Sun Quan's forces under Zhou Yu's command pressed on another attack on Cao Cao, leading to the Battle of Jiangling. On the other hand, Liu Bei used the opportunity to attack the four commanderies of Wuling, Changsha, Lingling and Guiyang in southern Jing Province and bring them under his control. By early 209, Cao Cao had lost most of Jing Province to the allies. As Liu Bei had become relatively more powerful after his conquests of the four commanderies, Sun Quan became apprehensive of him and decided to strengthen their alliance by arranging for a marriage between his younger sister, Lady Sun, and Liu Bei. Zhou Yu was suspicious of Liu Bei's intentions and suggested to Sun Quan to capture Liu Bei, put him under house arrest, and then take control over Liu's forces. However, Sun Quan rejected Zhou Yu's idea as he believed that Liu Bei's forces would rebel against him even if the plan succeeded. Sun Quan did agree with Zhou Yu's suggestion to consider attacking the warlords Liu Zhang and Zhang Lu, who controlled parts of western China, including present-day southern Shaanxi and the Sichuan Basin. The plan was not set into motion and eventually aborted when Zhou Yu died in 210. Even though Sun Quan did not expand his borders west, he managed to persuade several local leaders in present-day Guangdong, Guangxi and northern Vietnam to submit to him, and these territories became part of his domain. Sun Quan then agreed to \\"lend\\" northern Jing Province to Liu Bei as well when the latter complained that the south lacked resources to sustain his military. = Cao Cao's northwestern campaign (211) = 200pxthumb Cao Cao, after resting his forces for several years in light of his defeat at the Battle of Red Cliffs, made a major advance again in 211, this time to ostensibly to attack Zhang Lu of Hanzhong. Warlords Han Sui and Ma Chao, who controlled Liang and Yong provinces, suspected that Cao Cao had designs on them and launched attacks in retaliation. A coalition of forces from west of Hangu Pass, led by Ma Chao and Han Sui, were defeated by Cao Cao at the Battle of Tong Pass in 211, and their territories were annexed by Cao over the next few years. = Liu Bei's takeover of Yi Province (212–214) = Late Han stone-carved Luoyang tomb door, representing a door knocker with a taotie face motif, common in ancient Chinese art. Liu Zhang of Yi Province became worried of possible attacks from Zhang Lu and Cao Cao, so he sent Fa Zheng to invite Liu Bei into his domain to help him defend against Zhang Lu and Cao Cao. Fa Zheng was unimpressed with Liu Zhang's governorship and wanted Liu Bei to replace his lord, so he urged Liu Bei to use the opportunity to take control of Yi Province. Liu Bei heeded Fa Zheng's suggestion and led his army into Yi Province, where he received a warm welcome from Liu Zhang. Liu Zhang sent Liu Bei to station at Jiameng Pass in northern Yi Province to resist Zhang Lu. In 212, Liu Bei and Liu Zhang turned hostile towards each other and waged war. Zhuge Liang led a detachment of Liu Bei's forces left in Jing Province to join his lord in attacking Liu Zhang. Guan Yu remained behind to defend Jing Province. In 215, Liu Bei had defeated much of Liu Zhang's forces and besieged him in his capital of Chengdu. Liu Zhang surrendered and yielded Yi Province to Liu Bei. The province became Liu Bei's new base, and he used the mountainous surroundings as natural defenses against Cao Cao in the north. In the same year Liu Bei took over Yi Province, diplomatic relations between him and Sun Quan deteriorated when he refused to return Jing Province, which he \\"borrowed\\" from Sun Quan five years ago. Sun Quan launched an initial attack on Guan Yu and much of eastern Jing Province quickly submitted. However, after negotiations between Guan Yu and Lu Su, Liu Bei agreed to give up the three commanderies of Changsha, Jiangxia and Guiyang to Sun Quan, renewing their alliance and dividing Jing Province between them along the Xiang River. = Yangping and Hanzhong Campaign (215–219) = que pillar gates of Dingfang, Zhong County that once belonged to a Ba Manzi temple In 215, Cao Cao attacked Zhang Lu and defeated him at the Battle of Yangping. Zhang Lu surrendered and his domain in Hanzhong came under Cao Cao's control (January 216). Against the advice of his followers to move south and attack Liu Bei in Yi Province, Cao Cao withdrew his armies and left Xiahou Yuan in command of a small force to defend Hanzhong. The following year, Cao Cao pressured Emperor Xian into granting him a title of nobility, \\"King of Wei\\". Over the next few years, Cao Cao's style of living became more like the emperor's, and he also received greater honours. In 217, Liu Bei started a campaign to seize Hanzhong from Cao Cao. After Xiahou Yuan was defeated and killed at the Battle of Mount Dingjun in 219, Cao Cao became alarmed and quickly arrived with reinforcements to resist Liu Bei. Both sides became locked in a stalemate, except for a clash at the Battle of Han River, before Cao Cao eventually decided to withdraw his forces, giving up Hanzhong to Liu Bei. Liu Bei subsequently declared himself \\"King of Hanzhong\\" after his victory. = Breaking of the Sun–Liu alliance (219–220) = Around the time when Liu Bei was attacking Hanzhong, Guan Yu also advanced north from Jing Province to attack Cao Cao's city of Fancheng (樊城; present-day Fancheng District, Xiangyang, Hubei), which was defended by Cao Ren. While Cao Ren managed to hold on to his position firmly, Guan Yu besieged the city, and the situation was serious enough that Cao Cao even considered moving the capital away from Xu. At the same time, Sun Quan became increasingly resentful of Guan Yu because the latter had previously shown hostility towards him in three incidents: Guan Yu drove away the officials Sun Quan sent to the three commanderies that Liu Bei had promised to give up to Sun; Guan Yu forcefully seized food supplies from one of Sun Quan's bases for use in his Fancheng campaign; Guan Yu ridiculed Sun Quan when the latter proposed a marriage between his son and Guan's daughter. When Guan Yu was away attacking Fancheng, Sun Quan sent his general Lü Meng to launch an assault on Jing Province from the east, swiftly conquering the province within weeks. The morale of Guan Yu's forces fell sharply and his soldiers gradually deserted him until he was left with only about 300 men. Guan Yu was isolated and besieged by Sun Quan's forces in Maicheng, and he attempted to break out but fell into an ambush and was captured. Guan Yu refused to surrender and was eventually executed on Sun Quan's order. This marked the end of the alliance between Sun Quan and Liu Bei. Sun Quan nominally submitted to Cao Cao and was granted the title of \\"Marquis of Wu\\". Sun Quan also urged Cao Cao to take the emperor's throne but Cao declined.  Emperor Xian's abdication (220)  Cao Cao died in March 220 and his son Cao Pi inherited the title of \\"King of Wei\\" without waiting for formal authorization from Emperor Xian. In the winter of 220, Emperor Xian sent the Imperial Seal to Cao Pi and issued an edict announcing that he was abdicating in favour of Cao Pi. Cao Pi formally declined to accept the throne thrice but obliged eventually. The Han dynasty officially ended at that point and Cao Pi established the state of Cao Wei in its place, moving the capital from Xu back to Luoyang. The dethroned Emperor Xian was granted a title of \\"Duke of Shanyang\\". In 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor in Chengdu and established the state of Shu Han. Sun Quan continued to remain as a nominal subject of Cao Pi until 222, when he declared himself king of a separate state, Wu (better known as Eastern Wu in history). In 229, Sun Quan formally became emperor of Wu.  References  * * Zizhi Tongjian, vols. 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69. * Book of Later Han, vol. 9. .

Cacciatore is popularly made with braised chicken (pollo alla cacciatora) or rabbit (coniglio alla cacciatora). The salamino cacciatore is a small salami that is seasoned with only garlic and pepper. Preparation A basic cacciatore recipe usually begins with a couple of tablespoons of olive oil heated in a large frying pan. Chicken parts, seasoned with salt and pepper, are seared in the oil for three to four minutes on each side. The chicken is removed from the pan, and most of the fat poured off. The remaining fat is used to fry the onions, peppers or other vegetables for several minutes. A small can of peeled tomatoes (drained of liquid and chopped coarsely) is typically added to the pan along with rosemary and a half cup of dry red wine. Bay leaf may be used, along with chopped carrot to give extra sweetness. The seared chicken parts are returned to the pan which is then covered.

For example, in southern Italy, cacciatore often includes red wine, while northern Italian chefs might use white wine. Some versions of the dish may use mushrooms. In other countries U.S.-style chicken cacciatore In the United States, cacciatore dishes may be prepared with marinara sauce, though in Italy the dish does not always include tomatoes.

The project was initiated by Clay Ruby in 2002. Their musical style, difficult to categorize, owes more to freeform jazz, psychedelic rock, and experimental avant-garde music than to traditional folk music, and may be loosely attributed to such genres as free folk, psychedelic folk, freak folk or New Weird America. The Davenport Family name existed actively until 2005. Presently, all original members participate in a similar band, which operates under the name Second Family Band. The recordings and performances typically include varying combinations of drums and other percussion, guitars, vocals, synthesizers, piano, organs, violins, flutes, electronics, sound sculpture, field recordings, more synths, sitar, sticks, rocks, and stones. Their music is almost always improvised, with a rare exception of overdubbing and other studio composed manipulations, especially in the early days of the group. The group is noted for usually shunning the recording studio, preferring field recording in locations such as barns, caves, or pastures. Consequently, environmental sounds such as dogs barking, birds singing, and other ambient noise may be heard on record. History The group was unusually prolific in terms of number of titles released in the first years of their career, but most (though not all) of their records were pressed in small runs of limited availability on CDR's lathe cut records and cassettes. Many of these titles were recordings of live actions or intimate recordings of family rituals. In 2005 \\"Free Country\\" CD was released by Last Visible Dog marking their first official studio album. \\"Free Country\\" was soon followed by the self-titled Davenport Family LP on Not Not Fun Records, which featured half studio and half live workings. After gaining some notoriety as a free-wheeling Wisconsin folk collective, and just preceding the release of \\"Free Country\\", Clay Ruby made the decision to release a solo recording experiment under the Davenport name. Taking a cue from groups like This Heat, he employed the use of a handheld cassette recorder with a removed erase-head, to compose the entire album. With this technique, Ruby could overdub continuously onto what he had previously recorded though he was unable to monitor anything while actually recording. This resulting cassette, filled with fractured folk songs and environmental psychedelia became the \\"Rabbits Foot Propellor\\" CD on Three Lobed Recordings. Their very last jam under the name \\"Davenport\\" was performed on Walpurgis 2005, Clay Ruby's birthday, and released by Meudiademorte in October 2006 on a one sided C70 cassette called \\"At The Foot Of Zodiac Mountain\\". Between 2005 and 2007 many of the members formed different side projects, including Zodiac Mountain, All Do Gather, Orthodox Blood Orchestra. Many of the original members have regrouped since 2007 (along with an ever- revolving cast of new members) and the band has been releasing all their music under the name Second Family Band. They still continue to document the improvised musical rituals of their loose-knit community and have released dozens more albums, many of which do not feature Clay Ruby as a member. Davenport performing in Madison, WI - 2004 Ruby is present on all of the Davenport Family recordings but since reforming under the name Second Family Band, the band is operating regardless of line-up. No single member's presence is required for any Second Family jam session. Over the years, Davenport/Second Family has included Billy Lee (aka Lliam Ian, Crystal Dragon, Wormsblood), T Endless (Pan to Scratch, Drunjus, Craig Microcassette System), Nico Kain (Apaculus, Wormsblood), Clay Ruby (Jex Thoth, Burial Hex, Wormsblood, Hintergedanken), Dan Woodman ([Drunjus]), Theresa Behnen, Tyler Olsen, Jonathan Matthews, Clay Kolbinger (Maths Balance Volumes), Lyx Ish, db Pedersen, DMS (Craig Microcassette System), Nic Stage (Wormsblood), Karen Eliot (The Mumber Toes, Hintergedanken, Dragon Faggot), John Gould, Justin May, Jon Stage, Jerod Annoye, Beau Devereaux (Anvil Dome), Andy Knackert, Jessica Non Popa, Aaron Laurant (Cult of Hypnos), Corey Bushcott, Azrael Zanon-Stage, Jenny Hoffman (Telesmatic Images), David Libert, JoAnne Powers, Sven Bolan, Smith Baker, Ivan Calderon, Daeve Ross, Richard Remington, Cyrus Andreas, Jacob Tibbs, Nick Johnson, Kelly Shippey, Dave 3000, Ivan Mairesse, Max Elliott (Absinthe Minds), Mike Schultz, Johnny Danielson (Jex Thoth), Nathaniel Ritter, Troy Schafer, as well as collaborations with friendly outsiders such as: Peaking Lights, Spiral Joy Band, The Skaters, Tomutonttu, Jooklo Duo, Glenn Donaldson, Lau Nau, Maths Balance Volumes, Hush Arbors, Absinthe Minds, Relentless Corpse, Plastic Boner Band, Islaja, Wooden Wand and the Vanishing Voice, Mumber Toes, Nautical Almanac (band), Anla Courtis, Cult of Hypnos and Takuri Tali.

Kerry served as a Lieutenant in the United States Navy during the period from 1966 to 1970. His only tour in Vietnam was four months as officer in charge of a Swift boat in 1969. Kerry received several combat medals during this tour, including the Silver Star, Bronze Star, and three Purple Hearts. Kerry's military record received considerable attention during his political career, especially during his unsuccessful 2004 bid for the presidency. Commission and training On February 18, 1966, John Kerry enlisted in the U.S. Naval Reserve. He began his active duty military service on August 19, 1966. After completing sixteen weeks of Officer Candidate School at the U.S. Naval Training Center in Newport, Rhode Island, he received his commission on December 16, 1966. On January 3, 1967, Kerry began a ten-week Officer Damage Control Course at the Naval Schools Command on Treasure Island, California. On March 22, 1967, he reported to the U.S. Fleet Anti-Air Warfare Training Center for training as a Combat Information Center Watch Officer. Tour of duty on the USS Gridley Kerry's first tour of duty was as an ensign on the guided missile frigate USS Gridley, beginning June 8, 1967. On February 9, 1968, the Gridley set sail for a Western Pacific deployment. The next day, Kerry requested duty in Vietnam, listing as his first preference a position as the commander of a Fast Patrol Craft (PCF), also known as a \\"Swift boat.\\" These 50-foot boats have aluminum hulls and have little or no armor, but are heavily armed and rely on speed. \\"I didn't really want to get involved in the war,\\" Kerry said in a book of Vietnam reminiscences published in 1986. \\"When I signed up for the swift boats, they had very little to do with the war. They were engaged in coastal patrolling and that's what I thought I was going to be doing.\\" However, Kerry's second choice of billet was in a river patrol boat, or PBR, squadron, which at the time was performing the more dangerous river duty. The Gridley traveled to several places, including Wellington in New Zealand, Subic Bay in the Philippines, and the Gulf of Tonkin off North Vietnam. The executive officer of the Gridley has described the deployment: \\"We deployed from San Diego to the Vietnam theatre in early 1968 after only a six-month turnaround and spent most of a four month deployment on rescue station in the Gulf of Tonkin, standing by to pick up downed aviators. It was a fairly grueling tour of duty. Our helicopter was shot up trying to rescue a downed pilot and the door gunner was killed. The crew performed well and John Kerry's performance in all aspects of his duty was outstanding.\\" The ship departed for the U.S. on May 27, 1968, and returned to port at Long Beach, California on June 6. Ten days after returning, on June 16, Kerry was promoted to the rank of Lieutenant, junior grade. On June 20, he left the Gridley for special Swift boat training at the Naval Amphibious Base in Coronado. Commander of a Swift boat On November 17, 1968, Kerry reported for duty at Coastal Squadron 1 in Cam Ranh Bay in South Vietnam. Kerry took part in Operation Sea Lords, the brainchild of Admiral Elmo Zumwalt. The goal was to project a U.S. military presence more aggressively into an area that had long been a Viet Cong stronghold. As part of that plan, the Swift boats were assigned to patrol the narrow waterways -- inlets, canals, and coves -- of the Mekong River delta, to monitor enemy movements, interdict enemy river-based supply lines, invite attack and otherwise draw out hostile forces. During his tour of duty as an Officer in Charge of Swift boats, Kerry led five-man crews on patrols into enemy-controlled areas. His first command was Swift boat PCF-44, from December 6, 1968, to January 21, 1969, when the crew was disbanded. They were based at Coastal Division 13 at Cat Lo from December 13 to January 6. Otherwise, they were stationed at Coastal Division 11 at An Thoi. On January 30, Kerry took charge of PCF-94 and its crew, which he led until he departed An Thoi on March 26 and the crew was disbanded. =First Purple Heart= During the night of December 2, 1968, and early morning of December 3, Kerry was in charge of a small boat operating in and around a peninsula north of Cam Ranh Bay together with a Swift boat (PCF-60). Kerry's boat surprised a group of men unloading sampans at a river crossing, who began to run. When the men refused to obey an order to stop running, Kerry and his crew of two enlisted men opened fire, destroyed the sampans, and took off. During this encounter, Kerry suffered a wound from a small piece of shrapnel in the left arm above the elbow. Dr. Louis Letson, a member of the anti-Kerry group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT), claimed to have treated Kerry for this wound, but the sick bay report is signed by medical corpsman J.C. Carreon. According to Letson's account and the sick bay report, shrapnel was removed and the wounded area was treated with bacitracin antibiotic and bandaged. Kerry returned to duty the next day on a regular Swift boat patrol. Kerry was later awarded his first Purple Heart for this injury. Kerry's opponents, including the SBVT, have contended that this wound was too minor to merit a Purple Heart. However, guidelines for a Purple Heart do not distinguish between degrees of injury; in addition, a 2004 review by the Navy inspector general concluded that Kerry's awards, including his first Purple Heart, were properly approved. =Meeting with Zumwalt and Abrams= At the time, the U.S. military command in Vietnam had an established policy of \\"free- fire zones\\": areas in which soldiers were to shoot anyone moving around after curfew, without first making sure that they were hostile. Such encounters could result in the deaths of innocent civilians. Kerry has stated that he never thought he or his crew were at fault: \\"There wasn't anybody in that area that didn't know you don't move at night, that you don't go out in a sampan on the rivers, and there's a curfew.\\" Nevertheless, he soon concluded that the policy should be changed. On January 22, 1969, Kerry and several other officers had an unusual meeting in Saigon with Admiral Elmo Zumwalt, the commander of U.S. Naval forces in Vietnam, and U.S. Army General Creighton Abrams, the overall commander of U.S. forces in Vietnam. Kerry and the other officers reported that the \\"free-fire\\" policy was alienating the Vietnamese and that the Swift boats' actions were not accomplishing their ostensible goal of interdicting Viet Cong supply lines. According to some who retell the story, Kerry and the other visiting officers' concerns were dismissed with what amounted to a pep talk. One of the other officers who participated later recalled, \\"We all looked at each other and thought, 'What is this crap?'\\" Kerry later said that the Saigon meeting left him \\"more depressed than when I came.\\" =Second Purple Heart= Kerry received his second Purple Heart for action on the Bo De river on February 20, 1969. The plan had been for the Swift boats to be accompanied by support helicopters. On the way up the Bo De, however, the helicopters were attacked. They returned to their base to refuel and were unable to return to the mission for several hours. Kerry recorded the situation in his notebook: \\"We therefore had a choice: to wait for what was not a confirmed return by the helos [and] give any snipers more time to set up an ambush for our exit or we could take a chance and exit immediately without any cover. We chose the latter.\\" As the Swift boats reached the Cua Lon river, Kerry's boat was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade round, and a piece of shrapnel hit Kerry's left leg. Thereafter, they had no more trouble, and reached the Gulf of Thailand safely. Kerry still has shrapnel in his left thigh because the doctors tending to him decided to remove the damaged tissue and close the wound with sutures rather than make a wide opening to remove the shrapnel. Kerry received his second Purple Heart for this injury, but he did not take any time off from duty. =Silver Star= Only eight days later, on February 28, came the incident for which Kerry was awarded the Silver Star. On this occasion, Kerry was in tactical command of his Swift boat and two others. Their mission included bringing a demolition team and dozens of South Vietnamese soldiers to destroy enemy sampans, structures and bunkers. Along the Bay Hap river, they ran into an ambush. Kerry directed the boats \\"to turn to the beach and charge the Viet Cong positions\\" and he \\"expertly directed\\" his boat's fire and coordinated the deployment of the South Vietnamese troops, according to Admiral Zumwalt's original medal citation. After the South Vietnamese troops and a team of three U.S. Army advisors that were with them had disembarked at the ambush site, Kerry's boat and another headed up river to look for the fleeing enemy. The two boats came under fire from a Viet Cong B-40 rocket-propelled grenade, shattering the crew cabin windows of PCF-94. Kerry ordered the boats to turn and charge the second ambush site. As they reached the shore, a Viet Cong soldier jumped out of the brush, carrying a loaded B-40 launcher. With the enemy soldier only a short distance away from the boat and crew, forward gunner Tommy Belodeau shot him in the leg with the boat's 7.62×51mm caliber M-60 machine gun. \\"Tommy in the pit tank winged him in the side of the legs as he was coming across,\\" Fred Short said. \\"But the guy didn't miss a stride. I mean, he did not break stride.\\" Belodeau's machine gun jammed after he fired, and while crewmate Michael Medeiros attempted to fire, he was unable to do so. Kerry leaped ashore and, followed by Medeiros, pursued the man and killed him. The medal citation notes that Kerry \\"then led an assault party and conducted a sweep of the area\\" until the enemy had \\"been completely routed.\\" The mission was judged highly successful for having destroyed numerous targets and confiscated substantial combat supplies while sustaining no casualties. Kerry's commanding officer, Lieutenant George Elliott, joked that he didn't know whether to court-martial him for beaching the boat without orders or give him a medal for saving the crew. Elliott recommended Kerry for the Silver Star, and Zumwalt flew into An Thoi to personally award medals to Kerry and the rest of the sailors involved in the mission. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in the original medal citation signed by Zumwalt. In addition, the after-action reports for this mission are available, along with the original press release written on March 1, a historical summary dated March 17, and more. Sources close to Kerry say the incident had a profound effect on him: \\"It's the reason he gets so angry when his patriotism is challenged. It was a traumatic experience that's still with him, and he went through it for his country.\\" It affects the way Kerry lives his life every day, the source said, since \\"he knows he very well would not be alive today had he not taken the life of another man [he] never ever met.\\" =Bronze Star and third Purple Heart= On March 13, five Swift Boats were returning to base together on the Bay Hap river from their missions that day. A mine detonated directly beneath one of the boats (PCF-3), lifting it into the air. Shortly thereafter, another mine exploded near Kerry's boat (PCF-94). James Rassmann, a Green Beret advisor who was sitting on the deck of the pilothouse eating a cookie, was knocked overboard. Just afterwards, the boat came under attack from both sides of the bank. Rassmann dived to the bottom of the river. Repeatedly, when he came back up for air, the enemy fired at him. Rassmann was heading to the north bank, expecting to be taken prisoner, when Kerry realized he was gone and came back for him. The Navy's account of Kerry's actions is presented in his medal citation: :Lt. Kerry directed his gunners to provide suppressing fire, while from an exposed position on the bow, his arm bleeding and in pain, with disregard for his personal safety, he pulled the man aboard. Lt. Kerry then directed his boat to return and assist the other damaged craft and towed the boat to safety. Lt. Kerry's calmness, professionalism and great personal courage under fire were in keeping with the highest traditions of the US Naval Service. (Wikisource) PCF-94 received special recognition from Captain Roy Hoffmann, the commander of Task Force 115 (which included Coastal Division 11), on March 14 in his weekly report to his men: :Special recognition is due to the following unit this week, for exceptional performance: To PCF 94 for providing extraordinary assistance to PCF 3 which was seriously damaged by a mine explosion while proceeding down the Bay Hap [river]. PCF 94 picked up the MSF advisor out of the water and towed PCF 3 out of the danger area. PCF 43, 51, and 23 all assisted in suppression of automatic weapons and small arms fire, evacuation of wounded in action, and damage control effort on PCF 3. After the dazed and injured crew of PCF-3 had been rescued, PCFs 43 and 23 left the scene to evacuate the four most seriously wounded sailors. PCFs 51 and 94 remained behind and helped salvage the stricken boat together with a damage-control party that had been immediately dispatched to the scene. Kerry was slightly injured earlier in the day by shrapnel from a grenade tossed into a rice bin; he received contusions on his right forearm from hitting the bulkhead when the mine exploded near his boat during the later action. He received his third Purple Heart at this time. Return from Vietnam On March 17, 1969, shortly after Kerry's third wound, Commodore Charles Horne, the commander of Coastal Squadron 1, filed for Kerry's reassignment to the U.S. per Kerry's request. He was entitled to this early departure from Vietnam (subject to approval by the Bureau of Naval Personnel), because those who had been wounded three times, \\"regardless of the nature of the wound or treatment required ... will not be ordered to serve in Vietnam and contiguous waters or to duty with ships or units which have been alerted for movement to that area.\\" According to the Navy regulation that governed this (BUPERS Instruction 1300.39), the request for the \\"thrice-wounded reassignment\\" was optional at the request of the wounded party and required requesting reassignment. Kerry requested reassignment and was granted his request. On March 26, after a final patrol at night on March 25, Kerry was transferred to Cam Ranh Bay to await his orders. He was there for five or six days and left Vietnam in early April. On April 11, he reported to the Brooklyn-based Atlantic Military Sea Transportation Service, where he would remain on active duty for the following year as a personal aide to an officer, Rear Admiral Walter Schlech. On January 1, 1970, Kerry was promoted to full Lieutenant; on January 3, he requested discharge. He was released from active duty on March 1. All told, John Kerry was on active duty in the U.S. Navy for three years and eight months, from August 1966 until March 1970. He continued to serve in the Navy Reserves until February, 1978. He lost five close friends in the war, including Yale classmate Richard Pershing, who was killed in action on February 17, 1968. Honorable Discharge On November 21, 1969, Kerry requested an early release from active duty in order to become a candidate for Congress. The request was approved and he was released from active duty effective January 3, 1970, and transferred to the Ready Reserve (inactive). On March 1, 1972, the Navy offered Kerry the option of executing a written request to remain in the Ready Reserve or automatically being transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive; Kerry was subsequently transferred to the Standby Reserve - Inactive effective July 1, 1972. Kerry had no obligation to attend drills or contact the Navy other than to keep his address current. On February 16, 1978, Kerry received an \\"Honorable Discharge from the U.S. Naval Reserve,\\" pursuant to former Section 1162 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code and \\"in accordance with the approved recommendations of a board of officers convened under the authority of [former] Section 1163 of Title 10 of the U.S. Code to examine the official records of officers of the Naval Reserve on inactive duty and determine whether they should be retained on the rolls of the Reserve Component or separated from the naval service pursuant to the Secretarial instructions promulgated in [former] BUPERSMAN 3830300\\". With respect to Kerry's discharge from the Naval Reserve, Rowan Scarborough of the Washington Times wrote: > \\"A second charge is that Mr. Kerry did not successfully fulfill his time in > the Reserves, so a special board had to be convened to determine what type > of discharge he should receive.

As the presidential campaign of 2004 developed, around 200 Vietnam-era veterans formed the group Swift Boat Veterans for Truth (SBVT) and held press conferences, ran ads (financed in part by a major Republican party donor in Texas) and endorsed a book Unfit for Command questioning Kerry's service record and his military awards. Several SBVT members were in the same unit with Kerry. SVPT member Stephen Gardner served on the same boat. Other SBVT members included two of Kerry's former commanding officers, Grant Hibbard and George Elliott. Hibbard and Elliott have alleged, respectively, that Kerry's first Purple Heart and Silver Star were undeserved. In addition, members of SBVT have questioned his other medals and his truthfulness in testimony about the war. Defenders of John Kerry's war record, who include nine of the ten living crewmen who served under him, have charged that organizers of SBVT had close ties to the Bush presidential campaign and that the accusations were false and politically motivated .

Larson that began the Battlestar Galactica franchise. Starring Lorne Greene, Richard Hatch, and Dirk Benedict, it follows the surviving humans as they flee in Battlestar Galactica and other ships in search for a new home while being pursued by the Cylons. The series ran for the 1978–1979 season before being canceled after only 24 episodes. In 1980, a write-in campaign revived the show as Galactica 1980 with 10 episodes. Books have also been written continuing the stories. Battlestar Galactica was remade in the early 2000s with a reimagined miniseries and a weekly series. Plot summary In a distant star system, the Twelve Colonies of Mankind were reaching the end of a thousand-year war with the Cylons, warrior robots created by a reptilian race which expired long ago, presumably destroyed by their own creations. Humanity was ultimately defeated in a sneak attack on their homeworlds by the Cylons, carried out with the help of a human traitor, Count Baltar (John Colicos). Protected by the last surviving capital warship, a \\"battlestar\\" (from \\"battle starship\\"), named Galactica, the survivors fled in available ships. The Commander of the Galactica, Adama (Lorne Greene), led this \\"rag-tag fugitive fleet\\" of 220 ships in search of a new home. They began a quest to find the long lost thirteenth tribe of humanity that had settled on a legendary planet called Earth. However, the Cylons continued to pursue them relentlessly across the galaxy. The era in which this exodus took place is never clearly stated in the series itself. At the start of the series, it is mentioned as being \\"the seventh millennium of time\\", although it is unknown when this is in relation to Earth's history. The implication of the final aired episode, \\"The Hand of God\\", was that the original series took place after the Apollo 11 moon landing in July 1969 (as the Galactica receives a television transmission from Earth showing the landing). The later Galactica 1980 series is expressly set in the year 1980 after a 30-year voyage to Earth. Larson, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, incorporated many themes from Mormon theology into the shows. Pilot and subsequent changes The pilot to this series, budgeted at $8 million (one of the most expensive at that time), was released theatrically (in Sensurround) in various countries including Canada on July 8, 1978, Japan and some in Western Europe in an edited 125-minute version. On September 17, 1978, the full 148 minute pilot premiered on ABC to high Nielsen ratings. Two thirds of the way through the broadcast, ABC interrupted with a special report of the signing of the Camp David Accords at the White House by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat, witnessed by U.S. President Jimmy Carter. After the ceremony, ABC resumed the broadcast at the point where it was interrupted. This interruption did not occur on the West Coast. After the pilot aired, the 125-minute theatrical version was given a nationwide U.S cinema release in May 1979. The pilot had originally been announced as the first of three made for TV movies. After broadcast of the second episode, \\"Lost Planet of the Gods\\", Glen Larson announced the format change to a weekly series, catching his writing and production staff off guard, resulting in several substandard 'crash of the week' episodes until quality scripts could resume. \\"Lost Planet of the Gods\\" also introduced a costume change from the original, in that the warriors' dress uniform featured a gold-trimmed cape falling to upper thigh. Because of the costume change, a portion of the pilot was reshot; this refilmed version was released in cinemas in 1979. The original version of the warriors' dress uniform, a plain, mid-thigh-length cape, is documented in The Official Battlestar Galactica Scrapbook by James Neyland, 1978. Criticism and legal actions Battlestar Galactica was criticized by Melor Sturua in the Soviet newspaper Izvestia. He saw an analogy between the fictional Colonial/Cylon negotiations and the US/Soviet SALT talks and accused the series of being inspired by anti-Soviet hysteria: Isaac Asimov commented: \\"Star Wars was fun and I enjoyed it. But Battlestar Galactica was Star Wars all over again and I couldn't enjoy it without amnesia.\\" In 1978, 20th Century Fox sued Universal Studios (producers of Battlestar Galactica) for plagiarism, copyright infringement, unfair competition, and Lanham Act claims,Fullen, Andrew. Universal Studios vs. Battlestar Galactica, pp. 10, 171. CreateSpace, November 1, 2007. . claiming it had stolen 34 distinct ideas from Star Wars.Twientieth Century-Fox Film Studios Corp. v. MCA, Inc., 715 F. 2d 1327 (C.A.9, 1983) Twentieth Century-Fox Film Corp. v. MCA, Inc. p. 1330, fn 1, 5. Universal promptly countersued, claiming Star Wars had stolen ideas from their 1972 film Silent Running, notably the robot \\"drones\\", and the Buck Rogers serials of the 1930s. 20th Century Fox's copyright claims were initially dismissed by the trial court in 1980, then the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit remanded the case for trial in 1983. It was later \\"resolved without trial\\". Star Wars director George Lucas also threatened legal action against Apogee, Inc., the visual effects studio formed by John Dykstra and several other former artists from Lucas' Industrial Light and Magic who decided to remain in Van Nuys rather than relocate to San Rafael with the rest of the company. Lucas claimed that Apogee's work on Galactica was being done with equipment that he had left behind, for a project that would be in direct competition against Star Wars. Eventually, Apogee agreed to surrender the equipment to ILM, and several members of Dykstra's team returned to ILM. Afterwards, Universal's newly-formed visual effects division, Universal Hartland Visual Effects, took over the show's visual effects for the remainder of its run. Lucas also went after Galactica merchandise, claiming that the Cylon Raider and Colonial Viper toys could be confused with his own Star Wars toys. His major contention was that the Galactica toys featured plastic pellets that could be fired to simulate lasers, and these constituted a choking hazard for children, and he did not want to be blamed for any such accidents, despite none of the Star Wars toys offered by Kenner having anything similar. The Galactica toys were subsequently redesigned so that the pellets would not leave the toy when fired. Ratings Battlestar Galactica initially was a ratings success. CBS counter programmed by moving its Sunday block of All in the Family and Alice an hour earlier, to compete with Galactica in the 8:00 timeslot. From October 1978 to March 1979, All in the Family averaged more than 40 percent of the 8:00 audience, against Galactica's 28 percent.'Battlestar Show Blasting Nowhere at Light Speed.' The Montreal Gazette - Mar 27, 1979; Wilmington Morning Star Jan 11, 1979. In mid-April 1979, ABC executives canceled the show. An AP article reported \\"The decision to bump the expensive Battlestar Galactica was not surprising. The series ... had been broadcast irregularly in recent weeks, attracting slightly over a quarter of the audience in its Sunday night time slot.\\"\\"Battlestar Galactica, Five others to be Cancelled Next Fall by ABC.\\" The Toledo Blade, April 24, 1979. Larson claimed that it was a failed attempt by ABC to reposition its number one program Mork & Mindy into a more lucrative timeslot.Larson confirmed this on the Sci-Fi documentary \\"Sciography\\" The cancellation led to viewer outrage and protests outside ABC studios, and it even contributed to the suicide of Edward Seidel, a 15-year-old boy in Saint Paul, Minnesota who was obsessed with the program.Associated Press. \\"TV Death\\". AP, August 25, 1979.Associated Press. \\"St. Paul's High Bridge: Suicide Hot Spot\\" . citypages.com, February 5, 2008.Sci-Fi Channel. Sci-fiography: Battlestar Galactica, Sci-Fi Channel Productions, 2000. Language While primarily English, the Colonial language was written to include several fictional words that differentiated its culture from those of Earth, most notably time units and expletives. The words were roughly equivalent to their English counterparts, and the minor technical differences in meaning were suggestive to the viewer. Colonial distance and time units were incompletely explained, but appear to have been primarily in a decimal format. :Time units included millicenton (approximately equivalent to one second), centon (minute), centar (hour), cycle (day), secton (week), sectar (month), quatron (unknown, perhaps 1/4 yahren), yahren (Colonial year), centuron (Colonial century). :Distance units were metron (meter) and micron (second of time when used in a countdown, but also a distance unit, possibly a kilometer.) :Expletives included \\"frack\\", also spelled \\"frak\\" (interjection), \\"felgercarb\\" (noun), and \\"golmogging\\", also spelled \\"gall-mogging\\" (adjective). These words avoided US FCC guidelines on the use of profanities and the associated fines. :Other terms included daggit (a canine–like animal indigenous to one of the colonies), ducat (ticket), pyramid (card game), cubit (unit of currency represented by rectangular coins), triad (a full contact ball and goal game similar to basketball), lupus (a wolf-like animal indigenous to another of the colonies), and sociolator (prostitute). :Figures of speech There were a number of these used in the series, such as \\"daggit dribble\\", a term used to condemn falsehood, and \\"daggit-meat\\", used as an expression of contempt. Music The show's original music was composed and conducted by Stu Phillips, with the pilot score performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. It was recorded at 20th Century Fox, which later sued Universal over the series. MCA Records released a soundtrack album on LP and cassette with Phillips as the music producer; the album was later reissued on compact disc by Edel in 1993, and Geffen Records in 2003. For the series, Phillips used a studio orchestra at Universal, although the theme and end credits music as recorded by the LAPO were retained. In 2011-2012 Intrada Records released four albums featuring Phillips's music for the series, representing the first commercial release of music other than that of the pilot. (Phillips previously produced a four CD promotional set.) Except the first, all are two disc sets. * 2011: Battlestar Galactica Volume 1: \\"Saga of a Star World\\". * 2011: Battlestar Galactica Volume 2: \\"Lost Planet of the Gods\\" parts 1 and 2, and \\"Gun on Ice Planet Zero\\" parts 1 and 2. * 2012: Battlestar Galactica Volume 3: \\"The Long Patrol\\", \\"The Lost Warrior\\", \\"The Magnificent Warriors\\", \\"The Young Lords\\", \\"Murder on the Rising Star\\", \\"Take the Celestra\\", \\"The Hand of God\\", and Galactica 1980's \\"The Return of Starbuck\\". * 2012: Battlestar Galactica Volume 4: \\"The Living Legend\\" parts 1 and 2, and \\"War of the Gods\\" parts 1 and 2, plus music recorded for Mission Galactica: The Cylon Attack and Galactica 1980. \\"Fire in Space\\", \\"The Man with Nine Lives\\", \\"Greetings from Earth\\", \\"Baltar's Escape\\", and \\"Experiment in Terra\\" were entirely tracked with preexisting material. Follow on projects The series was remade with a reimagined three-hour miniseries in 2003 and followed by a weekly series that ran from 2004 to 2009. In 2009 Bryan Singer was tapped to direct a feature film remake with production input from original series creator Glen A. Larson.Bryan Singer to Direct \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" .

From the 1950s until the mid-1960s, the sisters ran \\"Rancho El Ángel\\"', the locus of their largescale prostitution ring and the site of at least ninety-one murders. Guinness World Records called them the \\"most prolific murder partnership\\". Biography The police picked up a woman named Josefina Gutiérrez, a procuress, on suspicion of kidnapping young girls in the Guanajuato city area, and during questioning, she implicated the González sisters. Police officers searched the sisters' property near the city of San Francisco del Rincón and found the bodies of eighty women, eleven men, and several fetuses. Investigations revealed that the sisters' criminal operation recruited prostitutes through deceptive help-wanted ads for housemaids. Many of the girls were force-fed heroin or cocaine. The sisters killed the prostitutes when they became too ill, damaged by repeated sexual activity, lost their looks, or stopped pleasing the customers. They would also kill customers who showed up with large amounts of cash. When asked for an explanation for the deaths, one of the sisters reportedly said, \\"The food didn't sit well with them.\\" Tried in 1964, the González sisters were each sentenced to forty years in prison. In prison, Delfina died due to an accident, and María finished her sentence and dropped out of sight after her release. Although they are often cited as the killers, there were two other sisters who helped in their crimes, Carmen and María Luisa. Carmen died in jail due to cancer; María Luisa went mad because she feared that she would be killed by angry protesters. The sisters and their crimes were dramatized in the Felipe Cazals film Las Poquianchis (1976) and the Jorge Ibargüengoitia novel Las Muertas (1977).

Electric locks are sometimes stand-alone with an electronic control assembly mounted directly to the lock. Electric locks may be connected to an access control system, the advantages of which include: key control, where keys can be added and removed without re-keying the lock cylinder; fine access control, where time and place are factors; and transaction logging, where activity is recorded. Electronic locks can also be remotely monitored and controlled, both to lock and to unlock. Operation Electric locks use magnets, solenoids, or motors to actuate the lock by either supplying or removing power. Operating the lock can be as simple as using a switch, for example an apartment intercom door release, or as complex as a biometric based access control system. There are two basic types of locks: \\"preventing mechanism\\" or operation mechanism. Types A deadbolt electronic lock mounted in a home safe = Electromagnetic lock = The most basic type of electronic lock is a magnetic lock (informally called a \\"mag lock\\"). A large electro-magnet is mounted on the door frame and a corresponding armature is mounted on the door. When the magnet is powered and the door is closed, the armature is held fast to the magnet. Mag locks are simple to install and are very attack-resistant. One drawback is that improperly installed or maintained mag locks can fall on people, and also that one must unlock the mag lock to both enter and to leave. This has caused fire marshals to impose strict rules on the use of mag locks and access control practice in general. Additionally, NFPA 101 (Standard for Life Safety and Security), as well as the ADA (Americans with Disability Act) require \\"no prior knowledge\\" and \\"one simple movement\\" to allow \\"free egress\\". This means that in an emergency, a person must be able to move to a door and immediately exit with one motion (requiring no push buttons, having another person unlock the door, reading a sign, or \\"special knowledge\\"). Other problems include a lag time (delay), because the collapsing magnetic field holding the door shut does not release instantaneously. This lag time can cause a user to collide with the still- locked door. Finally, mag locks fail unlocked, in other words, if electrical power is removed they unlock. This could be a problem where security is a primary concern. Additionally, power outages could affect mag locks installed on fire listed doors, which are required to remain latched at all times except when personnel are passing through. Most mag lock designs would not meet current fire codes as the primary means of securing a fire listed door to a frame.NFPA 80, Standard for Fire Doors, Frames and Other Opening Protectives, Section 5.2.4 Because of this, many commercial doors (this typically does not apply to private residences) are moving over to stand-alone locks, or electric locks installed under a Certified Personnel Program. The first mechanical recodable card lock was invented in 1976 by Tor Sørnes, who had worked for VingCard since the 1950s. The first card lock order was shipped in 1979 to Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel, Atlanta, US. This product triggered the evolution of electronic locks for the hospitality industry. = Electronic strikes = Electric strikes (also called electric latch release) replace a standard strike mounted on the door frame and receive the latch and latch bolt. Electric strikes can be simplest to install when they are designed for one-for-one drop-in replacement of a standard strike, but some electric strike designs require that the door frame be heavily modified. Installation of a strike into a fire listed door (for open backed strikes on pairs of doors) or the frame must be done under listing agency authority, if any modifications to the frame are required (mostly for commercial doors and frames). In the US, since there is no current Certified Personnel Program to allow field installation of electric strikes into fire listed door openings, listing agency field evaluations would most likely require the door and frame to be de-listed and replaced. Electric strikes can allow mechanical free egress: a departing person operates the lockset in the door, not the electric strike in the door frame. Electric strikes can also be either \\"fail unlocked\\" (except in Fire Listed Doors, as they must remain latched when power is not present), or the more-secure \\"fail locked\\" design. Electric strikes are easier to attack than a mag lock. It is simple to lever the door open at the strike, as often there is an increased gap between the strike and the door latch. Latch guard plates are often used to cover this gap. = Electronic deadbolts and latches = Electric mortise and cylindrical locks are drop-in replacements for door- mounted mechanical locks. An additional hole must be drilled in the door for electric power wires. Also, a power transfer hinge is often used to get the power from the door frame to the door. Electric mortise and cylindrical locks allow mechanical free egress, and can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. In the US, UL rated doors must retain their rating: in new construction doors are cored and then rated. but in retrofits, the doors must be re-rated. Electrified exit hardware, sometimes called \\"panic hardware\\" or \\"crash bars\\", are used in fire exit applications. A person wishing to exit pushes against the bar to open the door, making it the easiest of mechanically-free exit methods. Electrified exit hardware can be either fail unlocked or fail locked. A drawback of electrified exit hardware is their complexity, which requires skill to install and maintenance to assure proper function. Only hardware labeled \\"Fire Exit Hardware\\" can be installed on fire listed doors and frames and must meet both panic exit listing standards and fire listing standards. Motor-operated locks are used throughout Europe. A European motor-operated lock has two modes, day mode where only the latch is electrically operated, and night mode where the more secure deadbolt is electrically operated. In South Korea, most homes and apartments have installed electronic locks, which are currently replacing the lock systems in older homes. South Korea mainly uses a lock system by Gateman. Authentication methods Simple PIN electronic lock securing an elevator A biometric electronic lock with PIN entry A feature of electronic locks is that the locks can deactivated or opened by authentication, without the use of a traditional physical key: = Numerical codes, passwords, and passphrases = Perhaps the most common form of electronic lock uses a keypad to enter a numerical code or password for authentication. Some feature an audible response to each press. Combination lengths are usually between four and six digits long. =Security tokens= Another means of authenticating users is to require them to scan or \\"swipe\\" a security token such as a smart card or similar, or to interact a token with the lock. For example, some locks can access stored credentials on a personal digital assistant (PDA) or smartphone, by using infrared, Bluetooth, or NFC data transfer methods. =Biometrics= As biometrics become more and more prominent as a recognized means of positive identification, their use in security systems increases. Some electronic locks take advantage of technologies such as fingerprint scanning, retinal scanning, iris scanning and voice print identification to authenticate users. =RFID= Radio-frequency identification (RFID) is the use of an object (typically referred to as an \\"RFID tag\\") applied to or incorporated into a product, animal, or person for the purpose of identification and tracking using radio waves. Some tags can be read from several meters away and beyond the line of sight of the reader. This technology is also used in some modern electronic locks.

Biography Dukes spent about 20 years in England, and from his researches in the Bodleian library and the British Museum (which contain two of the most valuable Hebrew libraries in the world) Dukes was able to complete the work of Leopold Zunz. The most popular work of Dukes was his Rabbinische Blumenlese (1844), in which he collected the rabbinic proverbs and illustrated them from the gnomic literatures of other peoples. Dukes made many contributions to philology, but his best work was connected with the medieval Hebrew poetry, especially Ibn Gabirol.
