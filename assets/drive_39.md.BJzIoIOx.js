Legal concerns The first version of the program was cited by the Federal Communications Commission as part of what Broadcasting magazine called a \\"crusade against prize contest programs as possible violations of the lottery statutes.\\" In February 1940, the FCC asked the United States Department of Justice to initiate an investigation into the program. Two months later, however, the DOJ declined to prosecute, essentially giving Pot o' Gold a \\"clean bill of health.\\" Film The program's success prompted production of a 1941 American romantic comedy film based on the radio series. Directed by George Marshall and produced by James Roosevelt, the movie Pot o' Gold was released April 3, 1941, eight months before the NBC radio series came to an end.

In 2010, work began in the only classroom of the \\"outstanding\\" medical school, to describe why the doctor in charge had such weird symptoms attributed to his unusual tumor. Almost one year later, DLD/NP1 gene was identified and found repeatedly in Davis' DNA. DNA methylation of a CpG island near the DLD/NP1 promoter as well as histone acetylation may represent possible epigenetic mechanisms leading to decreased gene expression in human tumors. Nomenclature The naming was completely the choice the two students, after an arbitrary nickname for the Doctor. The second D in the name is attributed to Dr. Davis. Signs and symptoms The most common symptoms in patients with DLD/NP1 inactivation tumors are rectal prolapse, tenesmus, small bowel obstruction, lingual striated muscle hypertrophy, and priapism.

More than one hundred representatives from the laboratory, the Department of Homeland Security, the New York Police and Fire departments, various technology labs, and longtime friends attended the ceremony. Speakers at the ceremony included Dr. Daniel Gerstein, the Deputy Under Secretary for Science & Technology at the Department of Homeland Security, Richard Daddario, the Deputy Commissioner of Counterterrorism at the New York Police Department, Edward Kilduff, the Chief of Department for the Fire Department of New York, and Dr. Adam Hutter, the laboratory director.http://www.gsnmagazine.com/node/28660?c=cbrne_detection According to a Fox News report on the event, in a massive departure from the lab of the past half a century, the modern lab was designed with collaboration in mind to bring together sponsors, developers and first responders who will use the technology. \\"There is great need to apply tech tools in the field,\\" the New York Police Department's Richard Daddario told FoxNews.com. \\"NUSTL provides an opportunity to bring us together on important tech issues.\\" \\"We can better protect people by partnering with Feds and others ‚Ä¶ NUSTL is critical,\\" Kilduff told FoxNews.com.http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2013/02/28/inside-last- manhattan-project-facility-in-manhattan/?intcmp=features \\"The NUSTL is an invaluable resource within the Homeland Security Enterprise,\\" said Dr. Daniel Gerstein, DHS Deputy Under Secretary for Science and Technology. \\"This new lab is at the core of producing new and innovative solutions with improved collaboration, increased training, and upgraded scientific capabilities to make our nation more safe, secure and resilient.\\" http://www.fireengineering.com/articles/2013/02/dhs-to-open-national-urban- security-technology-laboratory-in-new.html 2018 Potential Closure The Presidential Budget Request for fiscal year 2018 proposes the closure of the laboratory NUSTL after 70 years of serving the security of the nation through various scientific and technology endeavors.https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/publications/DHS%20FY18%20BIB%20Final.pdf According to the justification, \\"NUSTL works with end users in the lab and field to promote successful deployment of both commercial and emerging technologies.

Many questions have been raised over the justification for closing unique and valuable laboratories that focus on detecting and mitigating terrorist threats via weapons of mass destruction (chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear) to help protect the American public.https://www.cyberscoop.com/trump-budget-decimate-dhss- scientific-research- arm/https://www.fredericknewspost.com/opinion/editorial/a-travesty-and-a- tragedy/article_3f375174-3f0f-5a5d-97a4-3fb3ee7110a0.html Regarding the potential closure, as cited in an article in the Chief Leader, one expert from John Jay College remarked \\"This is really unfortunate...in the age where we have to worry about dirty bombs.\\" These potential closures are \\"...part of a greater budgetary assault on science that will directly impact our ability to detect and respond to acts of terrorism.\\"  Efforts to Maintain NUSTL's Long- Term Stability  In response to the administration's plans to close the lab, advocates to keep it open have made their voices heard. Congressman Dan Donovan (NY-11) introduced amendment to an appropriations Bill to restore funding which passed the U.S. House of Representatives. In the press release about the amendment, Congressman Donovan stated: \\"NUSTL is constantly developing and testing new tools that ensure the brave men and women on our front lines can protect our homeland, and it's critical they have resources to continue their innovative work.\\" New York City Fire Commissioner Daniel Nigro stated that \\"Closing NUSTL would negatively affect preparedness and response planning for terrorist incidents, industrial accidents, and routine emergencies.\\" During testimony to the Subcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response and Communications (Committee on Homeland Security), Chief Timothy Rice of the New York City Fire Department stated that NUSTL has \\"strengthened the department's ability to save life and property and ultimately make the people of New York and millions of visitors to the region safer each day.\\" The New York Times published an article on the potential closure of the lab citing concerns being raised that closing the lab \\"could hamper efforts to prevent and respond to terrorist attacks.\\" Another article states that \\"closing Homeland Security laboratories ... puts lives in danger.\\" The NYTimes article states that \\"law enforcement and emergency management officials in New York and New Jersey, as well as members of Congress from both parties, said they were concerned about the potential loss of a Homeland Security research lab in a city that remains a top target for terrorists.\\" Specifically, they raised issues that the laboratory's work had saved communities millions of dollars in research costs and that other labs could not easily take over its work. Mr. Charles Jennings, a professor at John Jay College in New York who directs the Christian Regenhard Center for Emergency Response Studies. \\"It's hard to overstate the importance of what they do. Although it's based here in New York, its impact is nationwide. It's a service you just can't get anywhere else.\\" Furthermore, the laboratory's impact and value justify the lab's budget and closing the lab would be detrimental to the first responder community, with Senator Richard Blumenthal stating \\"It's less than a pittance in the federal budget...It's not even a fraction of a rounding error and has broad ramifications and impact on the law enforcement community.\\" On March 23, 2018, H.R.1625 , the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018 was enacted that \\"...fully restores funding for laboratories proposed for closure, including ... the National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center (NBACC), the Chemical Security Analysis Center (CSAC), and the National Urban Security Technology Laboratory (NUSTL).\\" This funding counters the myopic decision- making of the DHS/Science & Technology Directorate that took nearly two years to rectify, but for which lasting impacts remain. To address future stability of NUSTL's critical role to national security, on June 19, 2018, the 115th Congress US House of Representatives passed H.R.4991 - Supporting Research and Development for First Responders Act. Sponsored by Rep. Dan Donovan [R-NY], Rep. Kathleen Rice [D-NY], Rep. Peter King [R-NY], Rep. Mark Meadows [R-NC], the Bill authorizes NUSTL \\"...to test and evaluate emerging technologies and conduct research and development to assist emergency response providers in preparing for, and protecting against, threats of terrorism\\" and establishes that NUSTL shall: ‚Äú(1) conduct tests, evaluations, and assessments of current and emerging technologies, including, as appropriate, cybersecurity of such technologies that can connect to the internet, for emergency response providers; ‚Äú(2) conduct research and development on radiological and nuclear response and recovery; ‚Äú(3) act as a technical advisor to emergency response providers; and ‚Äú(4) carry out other such activities as the Secretary determines appropriate.‚Äù The bill was received in the Senate, read twice and referred to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs. Representative Kathleen Rice (D-NY) reintroduced the measure in the 116th Congress with Representative Peter King (R-NY) to authorize NUSTL, H.R. 542, to amend the Homeland Security Act of 2002 authorizing NUSTL. The overwhelming bipartisan support for the lab was apparent in the House vote 395-3. The efforts to fund and authorize NUSTL was done in a bipartisan fashion, pointing to the inane decision of DHS S&T; to try to close the lab. In a speech on the House floor to pass HR 4991, Congressman Dan Donovan (R-NY), stated \\"NUSTL has been a critical resource in protecting our homeland since 1947. Today, NUSTL is one of its kind test and evaluation laboratory for the first responders community...\\" further adding that \\"H.R. 4991 will ensure that the valuable work being done at NUSTL will continue for years to come.\\" Congressman Jim Langevin (D-RI) stated: \\"The elimination of this laboratory as a first responder resource is absolutely senseless... The importance of this lab to national security cannot be overstated.\\" Despite the groundswell of political and partner support to keep the lab open, the Presidential Budget Request for FY2020 again did not include funding for NUSTL. However, efforts have again been made by Congress and many partners to fund the laboratory for its unique and important mission for first responders. For example, Jeff Schlegelmilch, the deputy director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University's Earth Institute was quoted in a recent CNN article that \\"Removing that capability in any sort of unplanned way is going to cause trauma and potential vulnerabilities.\\" References Category:United States Department of Homeland Security Category:Hudson Square ","title":"National Urban Security Technology Laboratory"},{"id":"33625754","text":"The Woman Wins is a 1918 British silent crime film directed by Frank Wilson and starring Violet Hopson, Trevor Bland and Cameron Carr.BFI.org It was based on a novel by Cecil Bullivant.

After graduating from high school in Augsburg, he studied at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in the fields of natural sciences biology, physics, chemistry and geography with a diploma in Technical Biology and Bionics. From 1959 to 1961, he was research assistant at the Radiobiology Institute in Neuherberg, later in the Zoological Institute of the University of Munich. His research interests during this time gave rise to questions that later led to the foundation of the field of bionics in Germany. In 1967, he was a visiting professor at the University of California, Berkeley. In 1969, he was appointed professor and director of the Zoological Institute of Saarland University. In 1990, he initiated the field of study called \\"Technical Biology and Biomimetics\\" (which he supervised until his retirement in 2002) and also the \\"Society for Technical Biology and Bionics\\" (GTBB) of which he was the first chairman until 2003.Pade, C. , Petschow, U., Pissarskoi, E. & von Gleich, A. 2010. Potentials and Trends in Biomimetics. Springer After his retirement in 2002, he became head of the BMBF-funded Competence Network Biomimetics BIOKON at the University of Saarland.  Research  By making use of biostatistics, and also bringing together several scientific and engineering disciplines, his research which focused on mechanisms for movement in the animal kingdom led him to pioneer the field of bionics in Germany. Much of his published work centres on technology in the fields of biology, flight biomechanics and general bionics. In addition to technical scientific papers (over 300), he has published more than 30 popular books as well as articles which has stimulated interest in this emerging field. Professor Marianne Stokholm head of the Department of Architecture & Design at Aalborg university (AAU) Denmark, writes:http://vbn.aau.dk/files/3291925/Bionik-studievejledning.pdf \\"The German biologist Werner Nachtigall has since the 1960s been occupied with bionics. His writing on the subject is among the best.\\" Nachtigall formulated ten principles which he felt should undergird bionics:http://www.formundzweck.com/eng/autoren.php?N+Nachtigall+Werner * 1. The concept of biological design can be understood in analogous relation to the concept of technological design; * 2. The structural relation of technical biology and bionics is of image and reflection; * 3. The organism forms a functional whole; * 4. Biological design follows the principle of \\"optimum integration\\" * 5. The organism compensates for harmful overloading * 6. The overall size of an organism defines its stability * 7. An organism has environmental contact with the inorganic. * 8. A form always meets multiple requirements * 9. The organism is in contact with other organisms * 10. The organism faces a permanent energy crisis The biomechanist Steven Vogel in his book Life's devices: the physical world of animals and plants, writes, \\"Wherever nature has a structure, biologists have been painstakingly describing it, but most often paying little attention to mechanical functions. Nachtigall (1974) went the next step, gathering a vast collection of structural schemes for attachment, classifying them by function, and comparing each with its technological analogs. Among interlocking joints he recognizes miters, rabbets, dovetails, and mortises; under releasable attachments he describes plugs and sockets, hooks and eyes, snaps, vises, forceps, anchors, suction cups, and others. The diversity defies summarization. Even velcro has its biological analog ‚Äì what Nachtigall calls 'probabilistic' attachments, coatings of burrs invented repeatedly as a dispersal device for the seeds and fruits of plants. All that these latter require is gentle contact with a sufficiently irregular surface (fur perhaps originally but cloth works at least as well) and enough burrs attach to provide a surprisingly strong connection. Velcro...represents highly successful bioemulation: its inventor Georges DeMestral, deliberately worked from the seed barbs of cocklebur and burdock.\\"Vogel, S. 1988.

Joint custody may refer to joint physical custody, joint legal custody, or both combined. In joint legal custody, both parents of a child share major decision making regarding for example education, medical care and religious upbringing. In joint physical custody, also called shared parenting or shared residency, the child spends equal or close to equal amount of time with both parents. After a divorce or separation, parents may have joint physical custody as well as joint legal custody of their children, or commonly, they may have joint legal custody while one parent has sole physical custody, or rarely, they may have joint physical custody while one parent have sole legal custody.See, e.g., The opposite of joint physical custody is sole custody, where the child primarily lives with one parent while the other parent may have visitation rights to regularly see his or her child. Joint physical custody is different from split custody, where some siblings live with one parent while other siblings live with the other parent. History In England, prior to the 19th century, common law considered children to be the property of their father. However, the economic and social changes that occurred during the 19th century led to a shift in ideas about the dynamics of the family. Industrialization separated the home and the workplace, keeping fathers away from their children in order to earn wages and provide for their family. Conversely, mothers were expected to stay in the home and care for the household and the children. Important social changes such as women's suffrage and child development theories allowed for ideas surrounding the importance of maternal care. Joint legal custody In joint legal custody, both parents share decision-making rights with regard to matters that may have a significant impact on their children's lives, such as where a child should attend school, the choice of a primary care physician or therapist for the child, and medical treatments.See, e.g., Both parents also have the ability right access to their children's records, such as educational records, health records, and other records. Under sole physical custody arrangements, joint legal custody has been found to have beneficial effects on children compared to sole legal custody.Gunnoe ML, Braver SL. The effects of joint legal custody on mothers, fathers, and children, controlling for factors that predispose a sole maternal vs. joint legal award. Law and Human Behavior, 2001, 25:25‚Äì43. Joint physical custody In joint physical custody, the child lives an equal amount of time with both parents or for considerable amount of time with each parent. Typically, the family court issues a parenting schedule that defines the time that the child will spend with each parent.See, e.g., The percentage of joint physical versus sole physical custody varies between countries. In a comparative survey from 2005/06, covering children ages 11 to 15, it was highest in Sweden with 17% and lowest in Turkey and the Ukraine with only 1%.Bjarnason T, Arnarsson AA. Joint Physical Custody and Communication with Parents: A Cross-National Study of Children in 36 Western Countries, Journal of Comparative Family Studies, 2011, 42:871-890. Studies suggest that joint custody may significantly contribute to a child's wellbeing, with lower rates of mental health issues and substance abuse, better school performance, better physical health and better family relationships as compared to children in households where one parent has sole physical custody. On the whole, studies show that children experience better outcomes in joint custody arrangements and where they have good access to both parents. While not all studies of joint custody have resulted in similar findings, none have found that harm results from joint custody. Japan Joint custody is not legally recognized in Japan. Japanese courts favor granting custody to a primary caregiver, and nearly always award custody to the parent who is in possession of the children, even in the aftermath of parental kidnapping. Many Japanese parents believe that recognition of joint custody rights will reduce the problem of parental kidnapping and improve parent-child relationships following a custody case. Spain In a 2005/06 survey, about 6 percent of Spanish children ages 11 to 15 lived in a joint physical custody arrangement versus sole physical custody. Joint physical custody was introduced into Spanish law in 2005, subject to agreement by both parents. Some regions, such as Aragon and Catalonia, have subsequently passed laws that makes it the preferred option. United Kingdom In the United Kingdom in 2005/06, about 7 percent of 11-15 year old children lived in a joint physical versus sole physical custody arrangement. United States In the United States, joint legal custody is common while joint physical custody is rare.Sanford L. Braver and Michael E. Lamb, Shared Parenting After Parental Separation: The Views of 12 Experts, Journal of Divorce & Remarriage, April 2018 According to a 2005/06 survey, about 5 percent of American children ages 11 to 15 lived in a joint physical custody arrangement versus sole physical custody. Kentucky is the only state with a legal rebuttable presumption in favor of joint physical custody.Jason Petrie, Kentucky House Bill 528, LegiScan, 2018.Shared parenting law long overdue, The Daily Independent, August 28, 2018.

In 1993, Professor Arthur Obel, a Kenyan scientist, claimed that Kemron and another drug called Pearl Omega could cure HIV/AIDS. Kemron was later proved to be ineffective and Pearl Omega had very few positive outcomes. Obel tested on patients with these drugs and these patients filed a lawsuit on Obel for testing unproven drugs on them. The government later denounced both drugs and Obel's reputation has been discredited. Response After reviewing the experimental data, internationally recognized AIDS experts and health officials in the United States said that there was no merit to the claim. Kenyan president Daniel arap Moi announced that \\"Fifty AIDS victims have already been cured\\" and Koech dismissed the skepticism of Western scientists. Barbara Justice, a physician in New York, claimed that 82% of AIDS patients at the Abundant Life clinic saw increases in their appetites and \\"other improvements.\\" Neither the World Health Organization nor the NIH found evidence that Kemron performed better than placebo. Withdrawal of claim Support of the drug proved to be an embarrassment for many of its supporters as the drug failed to cure patients under controlled conditions. The University of Pretoria and the Government of South Africa ultimately were not able to support the claim of the drug's efficacy.

Ice Hockey Tasmania is a branch of Ice Hockey Australia. History = The First Ice Rink = The first ice hockey rink built in Moonah, an inner suburb of Hobart at 7 Main Road, Moonah. The surface was a standard international size of 16000sq ft, measuring 85ft x 185ft and contained suitable plant to enable the production of block ice for public consumption and provide cool storage lockers to store fruit and other perishable goods. The formation of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. into a public company occurred on 6 July 1950. The Rink differed from any other rinks built in Australia as it was the only open air rink at the time. The rink was opened on 23 October 1950 by the Premier of Tasmania, Robert Cosgrove after being introduced by the Managing director of Tasmanian Glaciarium Ltd. Mr. R.L. Worsley to the thousands in attendance. = Formation of the Association = The first ice hockey association in Tasmania formed on the evening of 23 August 1950 in a special meeting convened by the Nation Fitness Council. The chairman of the council, Max Lyall Moore, said the committee would help further the promotion of ice hockey in the state of Tasmania. Two provisional committees were formed rather than a unified committee, at the advice of Ted Moloney from Melbourne, one for ice skating and the other for ice hockey. Within the meeting the directors of Tasmanian Glaciarium Pty Ltd said the Moonah Glaciarium would be ready to use with a few weeks from this meeting. The first committee for Ice Hockey in Tasmania were: F. J. Ellis, R.W. O'Toole, T. Hope, A.W. Kelly and Alfred Chwalczyk. = First Ice Hockey Game in Tasmania = The first ice hockey team formed in Tasmania were the Mustangs. They played the first game of ice hockey in Tasmania in front of 3000 people at the first ice carnival held in the Moonah Glaciarium. The first game of ice hockey held in Tasmania was on 29 December 1950 and was between the Mustangs and a team composed of Hobart ice skaters, calling themselves the Red Devils. The Mustangs defeated the Red Devils by a score of 4 ‚Äì 3. 8 August 1951 while the Mustangs played the Comets during a snowstorm, the match was held up while snow was cleared away due to interfering with play.  Leagues  Ice Hockey Tasmania operates a single senior league out of the Glenorchy Ice Skating Rink along with a development program. = Van Diemen's League = The Van Diemen's League represents the highest level of senior competition in Tasmania. The League consists of 5 teams: * Cougars * Falcons * Ice Breakers * Red Barons * Sharks On 4 April 2016 the Van Diemen's League expanded to 5 teams with the addition of the Mighty Ducks, who began as a group of All Star players from Launceston. The debut game for the Mighty Ducks was scheduled for 5 April 2016 at 6:30 pm against the Cougars. On 6 March 2017 the Van Diemen's League introduced a new team called Ice Breakers, as the Mighty Ducks were not returning. The debut game for the Ice Breakers is scheduled for 4 April 2017 at 7:45 pm against the Barons. Presidents * 1952 ‚Äì W. A.

Dr Diyab is also a published author as her latest book \\"Crossing the Margin\\" was published by LAP Lambert Academic Publishing in October 2012. Campaign against extremism In 2005 Diyab was commissioned to write her first television series, Beautiful Maidens. The title was derived from the 72 beautiful virgins who are said to meet martyrs in heaven. The series was about the victims and perpetrators of a suicide bombing in Saudi Arabia. It aired during Ramadan and generated high viewing figures and mass media interest. She also wrote a 30-episode television drama; Ma Malakat Aymanukum, or Your Rightful Disposal, which was also broadcast during Ramadan. The title is from a passage in the Koran which talks of the enslavement of women. This series breaks of taboos on a range of contentious topics such as homosexuality, virginity, extremism, sexual and physical abuse, the burqa and the French ban on face covering. The show follows a woman who moves to France from the Middle East and what her life is like without the burka. Ma Malakat Aymanukum also received high viewing figures. Criticism  After Beautiful Maidens aired Diyab became a target for clerics and scholars who accused her of insulting Islam. Before the release of Ma Malakat Aymanukum unsuccessful attempts were made to persuade the Syrian government to ban her work. Diyab has been accused of atheism and her private life was investigated by religious leaders. Sheikh Said Ramadan al-Bouti claimed that God was withholding rain as a punishment to the nation for her work. She received further opposition during an interview on London-based Arabic TV channel Alhiwar in October 2010. In response, she stated, \\"I feel marginalized and I am always under fire in the Middle East media because of my liberal views and because I strive to break the boundaries. Religious scholars want to silence the voice of women and they play the role of politicians in the Middle East.\\" Controversy over the Burka She has been outspoken about the burka. In addition to writing Ma Malakat Aymanukum, she has expressed personal views on the clothing item. She believes Arabic women are being oppressed by men claiming to be motivated by religion. She sees the burka as a barrier to women achieving the equality they deserve. Meetings with Gaddafi Diyab was approached twice by former Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi over media projects. In 2007 they discussed a film he wanted made about the Italian colonisation of Libya. The film was to be called \\"Dhulm: Years of Torment\\". She described Gaddafi as \\"ruthless and intimidating\\". After agreeing to write the film and completing the script, the film was dropped due to a change in the diplomatic situation with Italy. In 2010 she was asked to produce a documentary on the late leader's life, however she declined the project claiming that it would \\"affect [her] credibility\\".

The company headquarters are in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Anvil is listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Australian Stock Exchange. As of September 2011 its major shareholder was Trafigura Beheer. Kilwa controversy Anvil Mining operated the Dikulushi Mine near Kilwa, Katanga. In October 2004 there was a small-scale uprising in Kilwa which was brutally suppressed by FARDC soldiers of the 62nd Brigade. Anvil Mining Congo was accused of providing logistical support to the troops. Indeed, the Commander of the 6th military region in Lubumbashi informed a UN Special Investigation into the incident that the military operation was made possible thanks to Anvil's support. Anvil later said it had no choice about letting the army use its vehicles and no knowledge of what they planned to do. However, Anvil made no mention of a requisition in its report for Q4 2004. Moreover, Anvil's chief executive, Bill Turner, did not say anything about a compulsory requisition when he discussed the incident in an Australian television documentary in early June 2005. The claim was not made until late June 2005, after this documentary was aired and nearly nine months after the incident. The company published a statement by the traditional chiefs of Moero Sector that denied any involvement by Anvil in the massacre and that praised the company for the benefits it had brought to the region. Other properties In November 2004, Anvil Mining agreed to pay US$12.5 million for a 70% interest in the Mutoshi copper-cobalt project. The property included the old Mutoshi Mine, the Kulumaziba coarse rejects/tailings deposit, the Mutoshi Northwest deposit, the Nioka deposit, the [¬Æ:. cobalt prospect, and prospective ground on the Kolwezi Klippe. In late 2005, Anvil started mining the tailings, at first with good results. Productivity began to decline in 2007 and 2008, and Anvil suspended tailings operations at the end of 2008. In February 2010 it was announced that the Australian exploratory mining company Mawson West was to acquire the Dikulushi copper-silver mine, which had been on care and maintenance since the fourth quarter of 2008. Anvil would receive 28% stake in Mawson in return. The transfer would let Anvil focus on its larger copper projects, including the Kinsevere Stage II project expected to start commissioning early in 2011 and to produce 60,000 tonnes annually. Mawson West also acquired the rights to a copper mine in the Kapulo area of Pweto Territory, Katanga Province from Anvil Mining in May 2010. The ore deposit is north of the main copper belt in the Kundelungu Plateau zone. Minmetal takeover In September 2011 a friendly takeover offer from Chinese Minmetals Resources was announced, causing a surge in share prices. Minmetals Resources is a unit of the state-owned China Minmetals Group. It was expected that Anvil could produce 60,000 tons of copper cathode yearly, starting in 2012. After the takeover announcement, the DRC's state-owned G√©camines mining company said that the change of ownership would lead to reviews of the agreements related to Anvil's projects at Kinsevere and Mutoshi Mine.

Tortula ruralis. In: Fire Effects Information System, [Online]. U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station, Fire Sciences Laboratory (Producer). is a species of moss with a cosmopolitan distribution. It occurs in North America, the Pacific, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, North and South Africa, South America, and Australia. It grows in many types of climate, including the Arctic, boreal areas, temperate areas, and deserts. It grows in tundra, coniferous forest, grassland, sagebrush, and other habitat types. This moss forms tufts of erect stems up to 4 centimeters tall. When it is wet it is bright green and the leaves are loose. When it dries the leaves wrap around the stem and it becomes reddish brown in color. It is dioecious. It also performs vegetative reproduction. Though it occurs in many types of habitat, it is usually not a dominant species. The moss grows on many types of soil, but most often calcareous soils. It tolerates a variety of elevations and levels of sunlight. It may be a component in cryptogamic crusts. It helps to stabilize soil and reduce erosion.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. The house is built on the southern part of the site of Chester Amphitheatre. History Dee House was built in about 1730 as a town house for John Comberbach, a former mayor of Chester. Extensions were made in the 1740s to the south and southwest, giving the house an L-shaped plan. It continued in use as a private residence until about 1850, when it was sold to the Church of England. In 1854 it passed to the Faithful Companions of Jesus, a religious institute of the Roman Catholic Church, who used it as a convent school. They added a wing to the east, which incorporated in its ground floor a chapel designed by Edmund Kirby. The chapel is in Gothic Revival style, in contrast to the rest of the building in Georgian style. A west wing in Neo- Georgian style was added in about 1900. In 1925 the building was taken over by the Ursulines, another religious institute. In 1929 they added another block to the south of the building, and during the process the remains of a Roman amphitheatre were found beneath it. In the early 1970s the convent closed and the building was used as offices by British Telecom. They vacated the building in the early 1990s and it has been empty since. Architecture The building is constructed in brick with stone dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan consists of a central block and two wings. The central block is in Georgian style, the west wing is Neo-Georgian, and the east wing, which incorporates the chapel, is Gothic Revival. The windows in the central block and the west wing are sashes, and those in east wing are lancets. The slates on the roof of the east wing are in grey and purple bands. On the apex of the roof of this wing is a cross finial.

The National Park Service rustic style structures were built in 1935 as part of the first planned campground in the park by Civilian Conservation Corps labor. Plans were developed by the National Park Service Branch of Plans and Designs. Similar facilities in Loops A and B were not built until the 1950s. The comfort stations are rectangular log buildings of one story. The logs are saddle-notched. The interior has separate facilities for men and women, separated by a utility room. The gable roof is covered with wood shakes. Rafter ends are exposed. The original chopper-cut log ends have been cut down flat. The comfort stations were individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places on April 25, 1995. The entire campground was considered for eligibility, but retains little historic integrity apart from the two comfort stations.

The expanded design somewhat resembles his classic Bank Gothic. Usage Agency is the main font in the 2011 first- person shooter videogame Crysis 2 and the 2012 first-person shooter videogame Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 and used in the logo for the in-development science fiction first-person shooter videogame trilogy Interstellar Marines. The Vancouver Canucks NHL club now uses the font, in modified form, with the introduction of Reebok's Edge uniform style in 2007. Nike has since adopted the typeface for use in their ice hockey uniforms for several countries, beginning in the 2010 Winter Olympics. The font was also widely used in the 2003 space flight simulator game Freelancer. It was also used in 2009 film 2012. The mobile version of PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds also utilizes the font in its UI. The Road & Track magazine also used Agency FB in 2011-12.

Quis ut Deus is inscribed on his shield. The Michaelion was one of the earliest and most famous sanctuaries dedicated to Saint Michael the Archangel in the Roman Empire. According to tradition, it was built in the 4th century by Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306-337) over an ancient pagan temple, and was located just north of Constantinople (modern Istanbul), in the village of Sosthenion (modern ƒ∞stinye) on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait. The pagan temple which had existed there had been previously associated with healing and medicine, and the Christians continued to associate the location and the Michaelion with healing waters. Michaelion was a magnificent church and became a model for hundreds of other churches in Eastern Christianity. Foundation A temple called Leosthenion () or Sosthenion () had existed at the location prior to the 4th century.Saint Michael the Archangel in medieval English legend by Richard Freeman Johnson 2005 pages 33-34Dublin University magazine: a literary and political journal, Volume 76, 1870, page 130 The site corresponds to modern Istinye. According to a widespread tradition, current already since the 6th century, the Church of St. Michael at Sosthenion was founded by Constantine the Great, who visited the temple, erected by the Argonauts and dedicated to Zeus Sosthenios or a winged deity. Constantine interpreted the winged statue of the temple as a Christian angel. After sleeping the night in the temple, Constantine reported a vision that the angel was the Archangel Michael, and converted the building into a church to honor him.The making of Christian communities in late antiquity and the middle ages by Mark F. Williams 2004 page 36 However, according to the French scholar Raymond Janin, this tradition is most probably later invention, created in competition with the other great shrine to Michael, at nearby Anaplous, which was of earlier date. It is certain however that the church of St. Michael existed at the turn of the 6th century, for the rebel Vitalian made it his headquarters and Emperor Anastasius I (r. 491‚Äì518) visited it in 515. In addition, early 5th-century Eastern Christian historian Sozomen recorded the devotions by the crowds at Michaelion and wrote of first- hand reports of healings at Michaelion, stating that he had himself received a healing. The pagan temple had been previously associated with healing and medicine and the Christian tradition continued to associate the location and the Michaelion with healing waters. By the late 9th century, the church had fallen in ruin, until it was rebuilt by Basil I the Macedonian (r. 867‚Äì886). As an imperial foundation, it soon eclipsed its rival at Anaplous. A monastery was attached to the church at an unknown later date. It is first securely attested in the 11th century and is continuously mentioned until 1337. Janin hypothesizes that it was demolished in the 15th century, and its material used in the construction of the nearby Rumelihisarƒ± fortress. Battle and iconography A Constantine coin (c.337) showing his labarum spearing a serpent. Constantine was the first Roman Emperor to become a Christian and in 313 AD along with his co-Emperor Licinius signed the Edict of Milan, allowing Christians to worship freely and build public churches, rather than worshiping in secret.The world of the early Christians by Joseph Francis Kelly 1997 page 158Catholic encyclopedia Constantine the Great However, Constantine and Licinius later fought each other and in 324 AD Constantine defeated Licinius at the Battle of Adrianople, not far from the Michaelion - attributing the victory to Archangel Michael. Constantine felt that both Licinius and Arius were agents of Satan, and associated them with the serpent described in the Book of Revelation (12:9).Constantine and the Christian empire by Charles Matson Odahl 2004 page 315 Constantine represented Licenius as a snake on his coins.A Companion to Roman Religion by J√∂rg R√ºpke 2011 page 159 After the victory, Constantine commissioned a depiction of himself and his sons slaying Licinius represented as a serpent - a symbolism borrowed from the Christian teachings on the Archangel to whom he attributed the victory. A similar painting, this time with the Archangel Michael himself slaying a serpent then became a major art piece at the Michaelion and eventually lead to the standard iconography of Archangel Michael as a warrior saint. A model for other churches After the construction of the church a monastery was added to it, and thereafter four other churches in honor of Archangel Michael followed it in Constantinople. During the reign of the next several emperors after Constantine, the number of churches dedicated to Archangel Michael in Constantinople increased to fifteen. Michaelion was a magnificent church and based on the reports of miracles there it became a model for hundreds of other churches in Eastern Christianity.Sacred and Legendary Art by Anna Jameson 2004 page 92 However, Churches dedicated to the Archangel in Western Christianity lagged those in the East for some time. As at the Michaelion, the association of Archangel Michael with healing and protection continued into the 6th century, when after a plague in Rome, the sick slept at night in the church of Castel Sant'Angelo dedicated to him for saving Rome from the plague.Catholic encyclopedia: St. Michael the Archangel See also * St. Michael's Church (disambiguation) * Cathedral of Saint Michael (disambiguation) * Michael (archangel) * Saint Michael (Roman Catholic) References Category:4th- century Christianity Category:Christian organizations established in the 4th century Category:Michael (archangel) ","title":"Michaelion"},{"id":"33626324","text":"The New York Hotel is a historic hotel in Fruitland Park, Mississippi.

Thousands of parcels of cutover land in the South were marketed to farmers in the midwestern and northeastern United States between 1900 and 1920. The New York Hotel operated from 1914 until 1919 to serve potential buyers of property in the planned community.

From early autumn to late spring the town hosted close to 1,000 people. For a time, it was the largest community between St. Boniface and the Pacific. The community was built in and around the Y where Tail Creek (a tributary of Buffalo Lake) joins the Red Deer River, east of Red Deer, Alberta. The community met and welcomed the Royal Canadian Mounted Police in January 1875, including Sam Steele, who later placed a four-man detachment in the community. The community was wiped out by a prairie fire in 1878. It was not rebuilt, due to the extermination of the buffalo herds. One cabin is said to have survived and is preserved in Stettler.

The complex is considered to be one of Jacobsen's most important architectural works.\\"Munkeg√•rdsskolen, Vangedevej 178, S√∏borg, 1957\\", Arne Jaobsen i Gentofte , Gentofte Kommune. Retrieved 3 November 2011. Background At the end of the 1940s and beginning of the 1950s, a considerable number of schools were built in Denmark. Special attention was given at the time to the need for the child's physical wellbeing, inspired in part by the English one-storey school buildings of the period. In 1949, Munkegaard School, was conceived as one of the first one-storey schools in Denmark. The overall idea was to build a complex for a large number of children which had all the advantages of a much smaller school. It was thought this could be achieved by dividing the complex into sets of two adjacent classrooms, each with its own courtyard or garden, in order to provide a feeling of intimacy and wellbeing.\\"Munkeg√•rdsskolen: Historie\\", Gentofte Kommune. Retrieved 3 November 2011. Architecture Desk designed by Arne Jacobsen The yellow-brick complex consists of a rectangular grid of one-storey buildings linked together by transversal glass-walled corridors. Each of the 24 classrooms has direct access to one of the courtyards between the buildings. Science classrooms and specialist facilities, including a library, are located in a two-storey building on one side of the complex while a second two-storey building housing an assembly hall, offices and other facilities stands at the centre of the site. Steps lead down a slope to the playing field below the school. In addition to light from the full-height windows on the walls overlooking the courtyards, daylight comes in through south-facing clerestories in the split-pitched roofs, illuminating the back of the classrooms.\\"Munkeg√•rdsskolen\\" , Dansk Arkitektur Center, Retrieved 3 November 2011.Christopher Woodward, Copenhagen, 1998: Manchester University Press ND, p. 93. . Virtually everything in the school has been designed by Jacobsen: the interiors, fittings, desks and chairs, lighting, curtains, as well as the specially laid out gardens. Some of the items, such as the classroom lights (Munkeg√•rdslampen) and his plexiglass panel of loud speakers, were later manufactured on an industrial basis. The small, individually planted courtyards contain antique sculptures, some freestanding, some as reliefs on the walls. Even though the school was designed for about a thousand pupils, it has an uncomplicated look and was complimented on its sensible layout and intimacy. Its simple, humane appearance is a result of the complex's carefully calculated proportions. As with Jacobsen's other works, a characteristically rigid system emerges as a living development. The result is a building which contributed to elegant school design in the 1950s. As a result of widespread interest in Munkeg√•rd, Jacobsen was chosen to design St Catherine's College, Oxford. Extension In 1996, Munkegaard School was given the status of a listed building. In 2001, the school presented plans for alterations and extensions but these were not accepted as a result of its status. After negotiations between Gentofte Municipality and the Ministry of Culture, permission was granted for additional facilities to be built beneath the existing buildings. Under the supervision of Dorte Mandrup, work began in January 2006 and was completed at the end of 2009.

After service he moved to Los Angeles at the invitation of Metro- Goldwyn-Mayer chief of production Dore Schary to become a film producer. His credits include The Magnificent Yankee, a biopic of Oliver Wendell Holmes, which was nominated for two Academy Awards: Best Actor for Louis Calhern and Best Costume Design. Leopold and Loeb Deutsch claimed that, as an 11-year- old in 1924, he may have been the intended target of the thrill killers Leopold and Loeb, who went on to kidnap and murder his schoolmate, Robert \\"Bobby\\" Franks. Writing in The Chicago Tribune in 1996, he stated that he avoided his brush with death as rather than walking home from school, he was driven to a dentist appointment by his chauffeur: > It was no mystery why Richard Loeb and Nathan Leopold had singled me out as > a prime prospect for their heinous crime. My grandfather, Julius Rosenwald, > was the chairman of the board of Sears, Roebuck and Co. His prominence made > me an ideal choice. In addition, Loeb's father was a Sears vice president. > Our families were friends...So I knew and trusted both older boys, a great > plus as they formulated their plans for what would become the first \\"crime > of the century.\\" Producer credits * Ambush (1950) * Right Cross (1950) * The Magnificent Yankee (1950) * Three Guys Named Mike (1951) * Kind Lady (1951) * Carbine Williams (1952) * So Bright the Flame (1952) (original title The Girl in White) * The Girl Who Had Everything (1953) * Green Fire (1954) * Slander (1957) * Saddle the Wind (1958) Memoir Deutsch's memoir Me and Bogie: And Other Friends and Acquaintances from a Life in Hollywood and Beyond was published in 1991.

The Settecento saw the transition from Late Baroque to Neoclassicism: great artists of this period include Vanvitelli, Canaletto and Canova, as well as the composer Vivaldi and the writer Goldoni. Characteristics The Settecento is a word today commonly used to describe this period Italy. The first decades of the Settecento saw the ultimate end of the Renaissance movement in Italy, and the last development of the Counter Reformation and Baroque era. In the 18th century, the political and socio-cultural condition of Italy began to improve, under Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, and his successors. These princes were influenced by philosophers, who in their turn felt the influence of a general movement of ideas at large in many parts of Europe, sometimes called The Enlightenment. All this led to a cultural revival in the 18th century's second half: the Age of Reason and Reform. Politically Italy suffered mainly because of the crisis of the Republic of Venice, but in the last years of Settecento Napoleon Bonaparte brought the French Revolution ideals to Italy and created in 1797 the first unitarian state in the peninsula since the early Middle Ages: the Cisalpine Republic, that in 1804 became the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy. Architecture The 18th century saw the capital of Europe's architectural world transferred from Rome to Paris. The Italian Rococo, which flourished in Rome from the 1720s onward, was profoundly influenced by the ideas of Borromini. The most talented architects active in Rome ‚Äî Francesco de Sanctis (Spanish Steps, 1723) and Filippo Raguzzini (Piazza Sant'Ignazio, 1727) ‚Äî had little influence outside their native country, as did numerous practitioners of the Sicilian Baroque, including Giovanni Battista Vaccarini, Andrea Palma. Luigi Vanvitelli was among the most prominent architects of Italy during this century, he built the Palace of Caserta at the request of Charles VII of Naples and worked on many other palaces and buildings like the Royal Palace of Naples the Royal Palace of Milan and the Basilica of Santissima Annunziata Maggiore.

Rococo style was better suited to smaller works, and arguably found its ideal sculptural form in early European porcelain, and interior decorative schemes in wood or plaster. Music Antonio Vivaldi was the most important composer in Italy at the end of the Baroque period. He wrote more than 400 concertos for various instruments, especially for the violin. The scores of 21 operas, including his first and last, are still intact. His best known work is a series of violin concertos known as The Four Seasons. Johann Sebastian Bach was deeply influenced by Vivaldi's concertos and arias (recalled in his St John Passion, St Matthew Passion, and cantatas). Bach transcribed six of Vivaldi's concerti for solo keyboard, three for organ, and one for four harpsichords, strings, and basso continuo based upon the concerto for four violins, two violas, cello, and basso continuo. Literature Carlo Goldoni (1707-1793) was the most important Italian literate of the Settecento. He produced over 150 comedies. Giambattista Vico and Lodovico Muratori were the most notable Italian historians of this century, while the leading figure of the literary revival in poetry was Giuseppe Parini. Count Vittorio Alfieri (1749-1803) was an Italian dramatist and poet, considered the \\"founder of Italian tragedy.\\" Alfieri is often indicated as one of the precursors of the Romanticism in Europe. Philosophy Frontpage of the original Italian edition Dei delitti e delle pene, Beccaria's masterpiece that proposed the abolition of the death penalty. Italy was affected during the Settecento by the \\"enlightenment\\", a movement which was a consequence of the Renaissance and changed the road of Italian philosophy. Followers of the group often met to discuss in private salons and coffeehouses, notably in the cities of Milan, Rome and Venice. Cities with important universities such as Padua, Bologna and Naples, however, also remained great centres of scholarship and the intellect, with several philosophers such as Giambattista Vico (1668‚Äì1744) (who is widely regarded as being the founder of modern Italian philosophy) and Antonio Genovesi. Italian society also dramatically changed during the Enlightenment. The church's power was significantly reduced, and it was a period of great thought and invention, with scientists such as Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani discovering new things and greatly contributing to Western science. Cesare Beccaria was also one of the greatest Italian Enlightenment writers, who was famous for his masterpiece Of Crimes and Punishments (1764), which was later translated into 22 languages. In it, Beccaria put forth some of the first modern arguments against the death penalty. His treatise was also the first full work of penology, advocating reform of the criminal law system. The book was the first full-scale work to tackle criminal reform and to suggest that criminal justice should conform to rational principles. As a consequence in Italy, the first pre-unitarian state to abolish the death penalty was the Grand Duchy of Tuscany as of November 30, 1786, under the reign of Pietro Leopoldo, later Holy Roman Emperor Leopold II. So Tuscany was the first civil state in the world to do away with torture and capital punishment. In 2000, Tuscany's regional authorities instituted an annual holiday on 30 November to commemorate the event. The event is commemorated on this day by 300 cities around the world celebrating Cities for Life Day.

Historically a black school, it is housed in the former Armstrong Manual Training School, also known as the Samuel Chapman Armstrong Technical High School.  History  The school's original site contained 36,952 square feet and was purchased at a cost of $15,187.50. With the passage of an act of the 55th Congress, approved March 3, 1899, the school first bore the name Manual Training School No. 2, later changed to Armstrong Manual Training School. Designed for African-American students, it was one of the city's two segregated manual training schools, the other one being William McKinley Manual Training School (Manual Training School No. 1) for white students. It was named in honor of Union brevet Brigadier General Samuel C. Armstrong.http://wdchumanities.org/bigreadexhibit/exhibits/show/dcsegregatedschools/ward-5/armstrong On October 24, 1902, Dr. Booker T. Washington made the principal address at the dedication ceremony. The school is located on P Street, between First and Third Streets, Northwest. The Armstrong High Annex was dedicated on April 24, 1927. Chief Justice Walter I. McCoy of the District Supreme Court presided at the formal dedication. Proctor L. Dougherty, president of the board of District Commissioners made the presentation on behalf of the Commissioners. Addresses of acceptance were made by Charles F. Carusi, president of the Board of Education; Dr. Frank W. Ballou, Superintendent of Schools, and Garnet C. Wilkinson, Assistant Superintendent. Professor Dwight O. W. Holmes, dean of the college of education, Howard University, delivered an address on \\"The Citizenry and The Schools. Armstrong High School discontinued operating as a high school in 1958. The building served as Veterans High School, between 1958 and 1964. In 1964, it has served as the Armstrong Adult Education Center. The D.C. Board of Education closed the school in 1996. The Dorothy Height Charter School operated in the building until its charter was revoked in 2015. The building was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. It is currently functioning as an elementary public charter school under the name Friendship Armstrong Academy.  Architecture  The design of the school was selected by competition. A circular letter dated July 22, 1899 was sent to a large number of well known Washington architectural firms inviting them to participate. Of the fourteen designs received, the one provided by local architect, Waddy B. Wood, was selected. Arthur Cowsill was the builder overseeing the construction of the building that commenced in 1900 and was completed in 1902. The building and site cost $140,000 and the equipment, $38,800, making a total of $178,800. The original section of the building was designed generally in the Renaissance Revival style with a symmetrical facade plan of a central projecting pavilion flanked by two recessed sections. Well- placed classical details, such as the dentiled cornice, the elaborate pediments over the two main doors, and the cartouche at the corner pilasters, provide a sense of monumentality to the building. These elaborated main exterior materials were yellow brick. The exterior trim materials were limestone. The windows were 1 over 1 light sash with flat arches on both floors. The lintels and sills were made from limestone. In the central pavilion, the windows were separated by ionic pilasters that extended the height of the two main floors, giving a colonnaded effect to the facade. The door surround was composed of limestone with an unusual carved limestone pediment supported with carved foliated consoles. The roof is flat. A bracketed cornice built of limestone marks the top of the original section.The granite stairs rise from the sidewalk level to the first floor. The transom above the door is elaborated with fish scale detail. The girls' entrance and a boys' entrance were placed under the fourth window from either end of the central pavilion. The recessed areas on either side of the central pavilion contained four windows. The power plant consisted of two 50 horse-power engines and dynamos, two 70 horse-power boilers, generating light, heat and power. The entire building was lit by electricity. There were classrooms for academic work, four laboratories, arrangements for experiments in physics and chemistry and material for serving and cooking. There were four shops for machine work, wood-turning, carpentry, etc., where a thorough course in practical mechanics was given. During the 1910s and 1920s, the D.C. Commissioners acquired land adjacent to the school. An annex was constructed on the south side of the school between 1924 and 1927. The later additions, including the third floor and the adjoining annex, were designed to harmonize with the original section.  Academic and technical curriculum Curriculum was designed according to the educational philosophies of Samuel C. Armstrong and Booker T. Washington. It provided training for black students in a range of trades based on the belief that \\"all forms of labor, whether with head or hand are honorable.\\" Twenty-four instructors constituted the original teaching corps. The enrollment was 342 children, with seats for only 303. To relieve the pressure, however, the Board of Education recommended an additional building, with increased seating and shop facilities, asking for an additional appropriation of $65,000 for the same and also, that the salary of the principal be raised from $1,600 to $2,000 per annum. With the expansion of the school, the course offerings included both academic and technical subjects. The Annex was designed to recognize the practicability of technical high schools which would enable those who did not continue formal education beyond the high school period to embark upon life equipped with the knowledge of trade.

The lamb is not required to be firstborn. The mitzvah applies to the firstborn male offspring of a Jewish- owned donkey. The donkey retains a level of holiness and is forbidden for work. The redemption transfers the holiness to another animal, such as a cow, goat or sheep, so that the donkey can be used for work. The other animal is then given to a Kohen who usually eats it. The ceremony is similar to the redemption of a firstborn male, a pidyon haben when a month-old male child is redeemed with silver coins given to a Kohen. The mitzvah, albeit rare in modern times, is listed as an \\"obligation of the body\\"(\\"chovath haguf\\" vs. \\"chovath hakarka\\"‚Äìan obligation required solely on one of the land of Israel) and thus applies in the diaspora as well as the Land of Israel.

It also sells related services such as consultations and cost estimates for building projects. It has outlets in Alsip, Grayslake, Hampshire, Kirkland, Montgomery, St. Charles, Warrenville, Wheaton and Buffalo Grove. History Edward Hines, born in Buffalo, New York, in 1863, moved with his family to the Chicago area when he was two years old. Starting work at age 14 as an office boy for the S.K. Martin & Co., a Chicago lumber wholesaler, he became that firm's secretary-treasurer by age 21. In 1892, he started his own company, Edward Hines Lumber Co., and acquired the Martin company three years later. Frederick Weyerhauser, who founded the Weyerhaeuser timber company, became friends with Hines and served as a director of the Hines firm. Hines, who specialized in large-scale operations, acquired big tracts of standing timber, built rail lines for hauling logs, acquired sawmills in Wisconsin and elsewhere, and leased timber-cutting permits in Canada. One of his larger undertakings involved the Virginia and Rainy Lake Company, a joint venture among Hines and Weyerhauser affiliates that employed 2,800 men and 900 horses to cut and process timber in Canada and northern Minnesota through the late 1920s. Other ventures involved purchase of the Continental Coal Company of West Virginia, timber stands in Mississippi, and a tract in the Malheur National Forest near Burns, Oregon, that held \\"possibly the largest volume of timber ever sold in the Pacific Northwest\\". Known as the Bear Valley Unit, the large Oregon tract, near Seneca, was laid out in 1922 by the United States Forest Service. It was first sold to Fred Herrick in 1923, but Herrick defaulted on his contract with the Forest Service, and Hines acquired rights to the unit's 890 million board feet of timber in 1928. One of the goals of the Forest Service was to improve rail connections between national lumber markets and the Blue Mountain forests of eastern Oregon. After winning the timber contract, the Hines Company built the Oregon and Northwestern Railroad between Burns and Seneca. Timber cutting from the Bear Valley Unit continued through 1968. Ponderosa pine logs from the Hines tract in the Malheur National Forest Adjacent to Burns, Hines built a company town, incorporated as the City of Hines in 1930. Edward Hines and his wife, Loretta, designed the city around an oval park surrounded by houses with individual features meant to prevent mill-town housing monotony. In the 1990s, long after Hines' death in 1931, the company sold its interest in the mill. Current operations Since March 29, 2010, the company has operated as a subsidiary of US LBM Holdings, LLC, a new company based in Green Bay, Wisconsin. US LBM Holdings was founded by a private equity firm, BlackEagle Partners, LLC, based in Detroit, Michigan. BlackEagle bought the Hines company's bank debt after the lumber company encountered financial difficulty.

SYNCTHINK, Inc. is a neuro-technology company with foundational intellectual property in eye-tracking metrics and devices. The Company was founded in 2008 and is headquartered in Palo Alto, California. History SYNCTHINK was founded by Dr. Jam Ghajar, a clinical professor of neurosurgery at Stanford and founder and director of its Concussion and Brain Performance Center. He is also the founder of the Brain Trauma Foundation. Other notable board members include Alan Quasha, Ernie Santin, Kevin Quinn, and John van Merkensteijn. SyncThink sells its diagnostic device under the EYE-SYNC label. The EYE-SYNC is a high-performance device that uses virtual reality to assess abnormal eye movement, which is a common occurrence after a concussion. The device comes in a portable suitcase that can be used in a clinical setting or outdoors. The EYE-SYNC received FDA clearance in January, 2016 to market the technology as a medical device. The device is currently used by Stanford University as well as various other institutions. Technology Eye-Sync works by having a person wear virtual reality headgear over the eyes. The viewer sees a point of light that rotates clockwise in a circle. The technology tracks how accurately the eyes follow the light. It then produces a chart that can tell doctors whether the person‚Äôs eyes were off track while following the light, indicating synchronization problems between the eyes and the brain. An assessment from the test can be made in under 60 seconds. The company owns 10 patents and has tested 5,000 troops and 5,000 elementary, middle school and college athletes in the Bay Area and the New York area. SyncThink technology also has as more than 40 peer-reviewed research articles characterizing the impact of concussion on visual attention. Peer-reviewed articles have been in featured in Journal of Neurological Sciences, The National Center for Biotechnology Information, amongst others. According to research, the technology is imperative to quantitate changes in the saccades and monitoring or screening concussions as well as provides a fast and accurate assessment of cognitive functions. Funding The Department of Defense has funded SyncThink and its partner, the Brain Trauma Foundation, with about $30 million for the technology and clinical trials, one of which is finishing up now, involving 10,000 people. Ongoing revenue is generated from monthly licensing fees for the software that powers EYE-SYNC.

It houses exhibits from the Lauba collection, a large private collection of works by modern and postmodern Croatian artists. The venue is also used for exhibitions of foreign contemporary artists and for hosting various arts-related events. Name and concept The word Lauba comes from a game based around a circular avenue of trees, called a Lauba and it was coined in the minds of a few boys who spent their childhood days in Vrbovec. The aim was to run the entire Lauba without touching the ground.Ki≈°, Patricia New gallery Lauba is open, (In Croatian) Jutarnji, 02/06/2011, (accessed 03/11/2011). We can probably find its origin in the German word laub, which means leaves. The name was chosen for its personal resonance to the owner of the Filip Trade Collection.What is Lauba? Official Lauba website, (accessed 03/11/2011). Lauba House is one of the first private spaces on its scale for the display of visual art. The exhibition hall is 1350m2. Although housing the Filip Trade Collection, the space and its organisation do not wish to be limited to the roles of museum or gallery, aiming to initiate international exhibitions and artistic concepts. Architecture In January 2007 there was an architectural competition by invitation for Lauba House. In March 2007, the project by AGP Design was selected. The winning project best devised a solution to the harmonious coexistence of business, with the Filip Trade offices, and the art activities of the exhibition space. The solution was found in an interpolated elongated cube of offices raised on columns, which stretches along the south side of the exhibition space. The project was realized with modest and minimal resources just enough to clean out the building and return it to its state. Guided by the motto ‚Äúback to basics‚Äù, the valuable historical layers of the building were preserved. For example, the interior brick walls were cleaned and given a protective transparent coating which allows for the ‚Äúreading‚Äù of every phase of the building‚Äôs history. The position of the former weaving mill floor has thus remained visible, as well as the swollen eastern wall which had almost collapsed after the demolition of the attached building. There are numerous similar details consistently implemented throughout the space, giving it the impression of ‚Äúa frozen construction site‚Äù. The inserted cube, on the other hand, is a high-tech contemporary interpolation covered with black glass. Architect Morana Vlahoviƒá gave the final touch to the building by painting the exterior all in black. In accordance with conservators this was the only change implemented in order to associate the building‚Äôs appearance with the contemporary objects inside. Conservation The Lauba House is a building that once served as the TKZ (Zagreb Textile Mill) weaving mill, which now has the status of a protected cultural monument. Around it were factory halls, historically significant for the national textile industry, which had been manufacturing top quality damask ever since 1923. The hall was initially built as a riding arena within the Austro-Hungarian Cavalry Barracks. Emil Eisner and Adolf Ehrlich, the leading construction company in Zagreb, designed it in 1910. The barracks were situated on more than 20 000 square meters of land, including a building for the brigadier officer school team, a smithy, horse stalls and the riding arena. Lauba House has become the first example of a successful cultural heritage reconstruction in the western part of Zagreb. Interior Given that the building has no storage space architect Morana Vlahoviƒá developed a new way of exhibiting contemporary art works. Due to its status as a protected cultural monument, no digging was allowed beneath the floor level of the building. Therefore, the depot needs to function inside and together with the exhibition space. The architect came up with aluminium panels which replace the exhibition walls. Each panel is 5 meters wide and 3.5 meters high, with each divided into a 3 meter wide solid part, and 2 meter wide thick wire mesh. The panels are moveable and so it is possible to switch from a completely open space to a dense maze of panels. Exhibitions During its first few years, Lauba intends to present works from the Filip Trade Collection and current art production. The concept is called a Non-permanent exhibition as some of its segments will change on a monthly basis and thus continually offer the possibility of interpreting new stories.Bartakoviƒá, Tatjana When business builds long-lasting value - Lauba (In Croatian) Agenda Magazine, 15/07/2011, (accessed 3/11/2011). During each sequence of the Non-permanent exhibition concept, there are parallel exhibitions and events, which will together form an interactive Lauba program. The difference between permanent displays and temporary exhibitions are not polarised, they are set up side by side and are mutually complementary.

He was the youngest son of Prince Henry Borwin II, Lord of Mecklenburg of Mecklenburg. When his father died, Pribislaw and his three brothers divided Mecklenburg; Pribislaw received the Lordship of Parchim-Richberg. As he was still a minor, his brother John I acted as his guardian and regent until 1238, and he was raised at John I's court. He came of age in 1238 and moved into Parchim Castle. His Lordship included the dominions of Parchim (including Brenz and Rosengarten) and Ture, the bailiwicks of Plau, Goldberg, Sternberg and Richenberg (near Langen Br√ºtz on the river Warnow). He soon came into a border dispute with the Count of Schwerin, who forced him to hand over Brenz and Neustadt-Glewe. After this feud, he managed to stabilize the economy of his territory by founding the cities of Goldberg and Sternberg and stimulating Jews to settle in Parchim. In 1248, he granted city rights to Goldberg and Sternberg. In 1240, he founded Parchimer Neustadt on the west bank of the Elde. In 1246, he brought members of the Franciscan Order into Parchim. In 1248, he moved his residence to the newly constructed Richenberg Castle, on the Warnow near the village of Kritzow. Probislaw twice came into a dispute with Bishop Rudolph I of Schwerin, once about the payment of tithes and once when Rudolph constructed a castle too close to the border, in B√ºtzow. Pribislaw felt threatened by the caste. He burned it down and took Rudolph prisoner and locked him up in the dungeon of Richenberg Castle. He demanded a modest ransom, which the bishopric soon paid. Rudolph was released and then tried every means to overthrow Pribislaw. Pribislaw was outlawed and excommunicated. In 1255, Pribislaw was taken prisoner and handed over to Rudolph. His was removed from power and his territory was divided among his brothers and his brother-in-law, the Count of Schwerin. Pribislaw went into exile in Pomerania, where he received the Lordship of Bia≈Çogard as compensation. When Rudolph died in 1262, Pribislaw hoped that he would be reinstated, but his brothers refused this. In 1270, Pribislaw renounced his claims to Parchim-Richenberg and returned to Bia≈Çogard, where he died after 12 February 1275  Marriages and issue  Pribislaw married twice. His first wife was a daughter of Richard of Friesack; his second wife was probably a daughter of Duke Barnim I of Pomerania.

Career The band formed in 1963, at first playing instrumental surf guitar songs such as ‚ÄúWipe Out,\\" ‚ÄúPipeline,‚Äù and songs by The Ventures and Dick Dale. They played at high school parties and other small venues until they were discovered by Billy Cardenas, a local manager and producer. Cardenas managed such local bands as The Blendells, The Premiers, and Cannibal & the Headhunters. He began to get the band into larger gigs. On February 21, 1965, the band performed at the Shrine Auditorium with all the top East Side bands at a show called the West Coast East Side Revue. An album of the same name was eventually released on Eddie Davis' Rampart Records containing studio recordings by the participating bands. By this time, the lead singer, Ricky Almaraz, left and Richard Maga√±a (baritone sax) and Joe Cabral (Farfisa organ) joined. In June 1965, Cardenas recorded two instrumentals, ‚ÄúGet Your Baby‚Äù and ‚ÄúTuff Stuff.‚Äù at Stereo Masters studio in Hollywood. \\"Get Your Baby\\" was written by two members of The Mixtures, Randy Thomas and Wayne Edwards. \\"Get Your Baby\\" was also recorded during the same era by two of East L.A.'s most popular bands, The Blendells and The Premiers.

The culture had Indo-European roots and was culturally connected with Mycenaean Greece. The Vatin culture is dated to the middle Bronze Age and it is generally divided into three phases: Panƒçevo-Omoljica, Vatin-Vr≈°ac, and Belegi≈°-Iland≈æa. It flourished from 16th to 13th century BC. The people of the Vatin culture inhabited the entire territory of Vojvodina (Banat, Baƒçka, Syrmia) and many surrounding areas (including Slavonia, Oltenia, Bosnia and Central Serbia). Its core area was in Serbian-Vojvodinian Podunavlje. The remains of this culture were discovered at the beginning of the 20th century near the village of Vatin (Banat region, Vojvodina province, Serbia). However the real importance of this culture was only realised at the end of the 20th century, when the locality of Feudvar near the village of Mo≈°orin was investigated. Characteristics The Vatin culture was highly influenced by Mycenaean Greece and had already developed social differentiation within its population. The culture also developed large central settlements, which were surrounded by smaller settlements and farms. Large settlements were economical and social centers, as well as the seats of tribal leaders. These fortified centers had a defensive character and a large number of them existed in the wider area. The thick network of large fortified settlements represents an example of the collective defense of a wide space. The main occupations of inhabitants of the Vatin culture was agriculture and animal husbandry and it is assumed that they also produced beer. In many of the settlements, remains of children's toys were discovered. Tools, weapons and jewelry were mainly purchased by trade, but some larger settlements also had their own workshops that produced bronze objects. One foundry of bronze objects was discovered in Feudvar, and according to the researchers, it was probably used for several hundreds of years. There are indications that people of the Vatin culture also had basic mathematical knowledge.

She was one of the primary women in the fight for women's right to control and make decisions regarding their sexual choices. Active mainly in Britain, her principal focus was on sexual law reform, including the right for women to both access knowledge on and use birth control, as well as the right to abortion. She was also involved in labour parties, communist parties, as well as a number of women's societies. Stella Browne was one of the first women to speak out in somewhat offensive ways about her beliefs with a \\"Forward, Charge!\\" approach. She did this through attacks in her articles and letters that kept her in the public's eye and added to the debates around many controversial topics surrounding women's rights. She is famous for her lectures and her work with the Abortion Law Reform Association. As a women's rights activist, Browne was able to keep questions of women's rights to their body and sexuality in the public eye long enough to get other people interested enough to keep the cause going even after her death. Early life Stella Browne (birth name Frances Worsley Stella Browne) was born on 9 May 1880 in Halifax, Nova Scotia. She was the daughter of Daniel Marshall Browne and his second wife Anna Dulcibella Mary (n√©e Dodwell), who went by the name Dulcie. Daniel Browne worked for the Canadian Department of Marine and Fisheries, after resigning from his post as Navigating Lieutenant in the Royal Navy. Before marrying Stella's mother, Dulcie, the eldest daughter of clergyman Reverend George Branson Dodwell, M.A., and his wife Isabella Naysmith, he was married to Catherine Magdalene MacLean in 1867. In 1869, Catharine gave birth to Daniel's first daughter Maud, and shortly after died at the age of 35 from \\"chronic gastritis.\\" Daniel and Dulcie were married on 23 February 1878, and Stella was born in 1880, followed in 1882 by her younger sister Alice Lemira Sylvia Browne, known as Sylvia. When Stella was three years old, Daniel, now Superintendent of Lighthouses, was aboard the Dominion steamship Princess Louise, and drowned. Though the family was in shock after his death, they were supported in part by money and property from his will, contingent on Dulcie remaining unmarried. Dulcie remained unmarried, sold the home and began a boarding house for single women. This boarding house meant that Stella was brought up in an environment surrounded by the struggles of single women throughout her childhood, and watched the struggle of her own mother, now a single working-woman. Little else is known about Stella's childhood as she rarely referred to it in her later writings. She was known to have considered herself British, as opposed to Canadian ‚Äì detaching herself from her roots, her family having left Halifax in 1892 when Stella was twelve. Stella Browne was first educated in (Germany), as her mother's sister, Louisa Frances Siemens, had married an electrical- engineer with an extensive kinship network, enabling her to attend school there. While in school she became fluent in both French and German by 1899. This allowed her to write the \\"Women's First\\" to gain entrance at Oxford. She would be recognised for her refined and correct translations of German in her later life. In 1897, Browne entered the St. Felix School for Girls in Southwold, Suffolk. This school had very relaxed rules and encouraged its students to discover new things on their own. This promoted independence and leadership, as even their schoolhouses were named after women of achievement in history. While she was at school here she won a History Exhibition at Somerville College, Oxford in 1899, that afforded her ¬£20 a year for the three years, which was given to her guardian as her mother was still living in Germany at this time. Browne then attended Somerville, where she graduated with a second-class Honours degree in Modern History in 1902. This school was especially important in her career as it was one of the only schools at the time that allowed women to write exams alongside men and had them working towards an Honours rather than a mere Pass Degree as many would. This had an influence on Browne's expectations and ideals on gender equality as it was given to her in part while she was at school here. Her political activism was also fostered at this school through her involvement with Student's Parliament. Upon completion of her education, Browne first worked as a teacher in hopes of achieving some independence for herself. Her health however, began to decline due to a heart condition that she had, and she was no longer able to handle the strain of the job, developing additional anxiety problems. She then moved back to Germany where she discovered the budding German woman's movement, which Helene St√∂cker was heading in a fairly radical manner. St√∂cker was fighting at this time for women's rights of motherhood and support for the unmarried mother. St√∂cker's arguments strongly affected Browne as she, later in life, would fight for women's rights to control their bodies and for the choice to become mother. Browne then began work for the Victoria County History, writing up parish histories, and learning researching skills that she would use in her later career. She left this job in 1907, moving into the position of Librarian at Morley College in South London. Here she was able to take in various controversial lectures, with topics ranging from marriage and divorce reform to eugenics. Working at the college also allowed Browne to see the different social problems faced by both working class and professional class women. Browne met her first male lover here, known as her \\"demi-semi- lover\\" and never noted by name, only by his sexual prowess. She also joined the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU) in 1908, which marked the beginning of her social activism. Ideals Browne began to develop her belief system while at the college, experimenting with her lover and taking in the lectures of Morley College from her post there. She wrote a letter to H. G. Wells, arguing that not only men could be polygynous, women could too and these women were \\"not the least attractive and intelligent,\\" believing extramarital sex was not to be something blackening a woman's reputation. Many of Browne's beliefs stemmed from her following of the work of Havelock Ellis, Edward Carpenter and other sexologists. She combined it with her own feminist tradition forming a perspective unique from Ellis and Carpenter, on these concepts of sexuality. In 1912, she wrote in to The Freewoman under the pseudonym \\"A New Subscriber\\", arguing with Kathlyn Oliver's article that frigidity in single women was key to good health, and should be a standard for all women. Browne's response to Oliver argued that women should not be denied sexual pleasure simply because they are not married and do not wish to be married in fear to the cruelty that sometimes accompanies this union. Oliver responded to this saying that \\"A New Subscriber\\" must be \\"of the male persuasion\\" and that women are \\"above and beyond men' in 'sex matters'.\\" Browne's response to this accusation was that she did not like how Oliver normalised sexuality, believing that there was \\"more in human nature than most people will admit\\" and that to enforce complete abstinence on anyone despite circumstance was unfair and \\"stupid.\\" This was the beginning of Browne's advocacy that women should have control over their own sexual behaviour, and not be judged by society for these activities. Browne was a strong believer that women should have the right \\"equally with men, to sexual experience and sexual variety outside conventional marriage\\" which she addressed in her most famous paper \\"Sexual Variety and Variability Among Women\\" of 1915. She believed that women should not be confined to marriage to experience and develop the maternal instinct, while at the same time encouraged women to refuse motherhood if they wished to. Many of the other feminists looking into eugenics at this time, such as Mary Scharlieb and Elizabeth Sloan Chesser, believed strongly that reform could be accomplished within the companionship of marriage. More radical members such as Browne believed that the \\"cult of motherhood ‚Ä¶ would, if unchecked, diminish the importance of women as individuals and bind them more closely with conventional forms of marriage ‚Ä¶ [reinforcing] their subordination.\\" Browne's advocacy of these rights for women, along with her goal of assistance for single mothers, one could argue stemmed from her living in a home with a single-mother for most of her childhood. Browne strongly believed working women should have the choice to become pregnant, or terminate their pregnancy while they worked in the horrible circumstances surrounding a pregnant woman who was still required to do hard labour during her pregnancy. In this case she argued that doctors should give free information about birth control to women that wanted to know about it. This would give women agency over their own circumstances and allow them to decide whether they wanted to be mothers or not. It also would give women the opportunity to, as Browne advocated, engage in sex solely for pleasure and outside of marriage if they chose. Browne would remain loyal to this perspective throughout her life. =Activism= By 1911, Browne identified herself as being \\"a Socialist and 'extreme' Left-Wing feminist.\\" She worked most notably as a campaigner for women's rights to birth control and abortion and was most interested in rights and control over women's sexuality and body. Over this time period she wrote for a number of papers including The Call, The Malthusian, The New Generation (the new instalment of The Malthusian), The Freewoman, and Beauty and Health, as well as some of her own independent publications. She also wrote a number of reviews, and translations of popular works on the reforms mentioned above as well, which she was often commended for. She began her activism in 1907 when she joined the WSPU for a short time. The WSPU was founded on 10 October 1903 and had nothing to differentiate it from other women-only groups of the time, not even having reached 30 members by 1905. However, its notoriety developed when in 1905 they first used militant methods as part of its campaign for the vote, where both leaders of this rebellion, Christabel Pankhurst and Annie Kenney, were arrested, bringing the Manchester Independent Labour Party (ILP) to assist them. The ILP's assistance brought them to the forefront of media coverage and the WSPU and their militancy swept the country. This radical form of feminism continued until 1913 and that had women committing to hunger strikes and being fed forcedly, and the imprisonment of almost a thousand suffragettes no longer made headlines it was so widespread. Browne left in 1913 however, opposing Christabel Pankhurst's \\"ignorant and presumptuous dogmatism\\" and the way that the group's leadership behaved towards women and men of lower class seemed to counter their arguments for feminism and democracy. After this she spent much of her time working with the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology, attending meetings and writing papers on their behalf, in hopes of discovering more for her future battles on birth control. In the late 1920s Browne began a speaking tour around the country, providing information about her beliefs on the need for accessibility of information about birth control for women, women's health problems, problems related to puberty and sex education and high maternal morbidity rates among other topics. These talks urged women to take matters of their sexuality and their health into their own hands. Birth control was an embarrassing issue because it would directly challenge relations between men and women too, making this control for women a touchy subject. During this tour several women asked Browne for abortions, however as Jones recognises in her article, Browne was not \\"medically qualified\\" and had to refuse them. Though she was becoming increasingly interested in women's right to terminate their pregnancies, she would still be considered a \\"heretic\\" were she to say so at this time. Despite this, in 1929 she brought forward her lecture \\"The Right to Abortion\\" in front of the World Sexual Reform Congress in London. In the years leading up to the presentation of this paper, Browne worked to gather information on maternal mortality, and found that rates were higher than ever before in 1929, and became the secretary of the Chelsea Labour Party in hopes of bringing ideas of birth control and abortion to light in political platform in 1926. She was unable to do so as she was forced to leave Chelsea later in 1926, as the Party was no longer recognised as a political Party. By the end of the 1920s, Browne had felt that the fight for birth control had become more successful, as it was more frequently seen in the public sphere and was now being talked about and debated more openly. In April 1930 the Birth Control Conference was a success bringing 700 delegates to attendance and bringing birth control into the political sphere, which she attended and spoke at. In July 1930, the Ministry of Health issued MCW/153, which allowed local authorities to give birth control advice in welfare centres, another partial success for Browne. In 1931 Browne began to develop her argument for women's right to decide to have an abortion. She again began touring, giving lectures on abortion and the negative consequences that followed if women were unable to terminate pregnancies of their own choosing such as: suicide, injury, permanent invalidism, madness and blood-poisoning. By bringing the topic of legalised abortion into discussion, it was a major accomplishment in July 1932 when the British Medical Association council was called to form a committee to discuss making changes to the laws on abortion. =Affiliation with the Abortion Law Reform Association= On 17 February 1936, Browne along with Janet Chance and Alice Jenkins began the Abortion Law Reform Association (ALRA), continuing to support it until their deaths years later. In their first year with the ALRA they recruited 35 members, and by 1939 they had almost 400 members, that came primarily from the working class through labour groups and women's branches of the co-operative movement. These women now wanted the privileges that \\"moneyed classes had enjoyed for years.\\" The ALRA, as ran by these three women, was very active between 1936 and 1939 sending speakers around the country to talk about Labour and Equal Citizenship and attempted, though most often unsuccessfully, to have letters and articles published in newspapers. They became the most popular when a member of the ALRA's Medico-Legal Committee received the case of a fourteen-year-old girl who had been raped, and received a termination of this pregnancy from Dr. Joan Malleson, a progenitor of the ALRA. This case gained a lot of publicity, however once the war began, the case was tucked away and the cause again lost its importance to the public. After the war, the fight for abortion rights was renewed and Browne came back to her fight for the education of women in matters of sex. Her endeavours on this front afforded her the rank of first Patron and later Vice-President of the Society for Sex Education and Guidance, a group set up in 1943. She continued to be involved with the ALRA until her death, however she was unable to attend most of their meetings due to failing health. During this time, she was giving suggestions for actions that the ALRA could perform and these were continually followed. Browne's opinions on sexual reform were clearly still valued despite her increasing age and inability to be as involved as she once was. Browne was able to see the time come when medical terminations of pregnancy became more common though, which was a comfort to her. Browne had a severe heart attack at the beginning of May 1955, and the night before her seventy-fifth birthday she died. The worst offence that was afforded to Browne can be found on her death certificate where under occupation she is noted as being a \\"Spinster: No occupation.‚Äù Considering her opinion that women should not be labelled for their choice not to marry, this would be a huge insult to Browne. Historiography Research on Stella Browne's life and contributions to women's rights has been a gradually cumulative research process, in which each article or book written about her has pieced together the facts and commentary of those before them. So Lesley Hall's biography of Browne thanks Sheila Rowbotham for bringing Stella Browne into the public's eye for the first time, and Sheila Rowbotham's A New World For Women: Stella Browne, Social Feminist in turn thanked Keith Hindell for helping her with references for the section of her book about the National Abortion Campaign. In this way, one could conclude that instead of having contradictory views of Browne, historians have wanted to collaborate in making Browne better known in feminist history. The common understanding of Browne as a person is, as Jones explains her to be, more \\"economically and professionally marginal\\" than the other women working with the sexuality question at the time, though she was more \\"radical\\" in her views on both sexual and social questions. Though Jones seems to consider Browne's social standing to have been mediocre, she does give her considerable credit for her radicalism, and passion, as do each of the other historians. Hindell characterises Browne as a \\"somewhat eccentric blue-stocking\\" who was \\"not easily deflected by apathy, ridicule or hostility\\". This image of a woman resolute in defence of her beliefs is supported by Hall's biography of Browne, which consistently portrays her as someone who when knocked down, returned to her work with \\"unabated, even increased vigor.\\" If her radicalism may be seen to some as a negative thing, however Sheila Jeffreys rationalises Browne's radicalism saying that to \\"promote the joy of sex [‚Ä¶] it [was] necessary to be uncompromising in their attack on all those whom they considered to be standing in the way of this march to sexual freedom.\\" She notes that to do this feminists were required to, before World War One, to make these attacks on the vast majority of their colleagues, particularly \\"spinsters amidst the ranks\\". References to the attack on a specific \\"spinster\\" of the time, Kathlyn Oliver is referenced by both Jeffreys, Hall and Rowbotham in their articles, solidifying that there is an importance of these attacks in furthering an understanding of women's sexual activity not having an adverse effect on them. Jeffreys notes that Browne was very capable of getting her point across when discussing her opinion that sex should be enjoyed by women openly to Oliver, and the power of her argument is supported by Hall's assertion that later Oliver joined the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology to look into her sexuality, a suggestion made to her by Browne. Jones also notes that Browne was one of the \\"advanced\\" women that emerged before the First World War, writing for many different socialist and liberal periodicals and newspapers, getting involved in study groups set up by progressive intellectuals and also herself becoming involved in campaigns for sexual and social reform. These examples of Browne's activity in the struggle for women's rights concerning control over their sexuality is mirrored in each of the other works on Browne who only stop to explain that it was not always easy for Browne to please everyone because of her forward thinking. The most common argument then, across the research is that Stella Browne had the most trouble getting her two beliefs to coexist appropriately. Jones says that Browne constantly needed to be on the offensive around her ideals on eugenics around her socialist friends and Rowbotham comments on Browne's \\"continuing double struggle\\" to maintain both of these ideals finding connections between the two, which others in her two separate streams of struggle may not have agreed with fully. Browne was a hardworking woman who believed in her work so much so that she was even considered to have a \\"personal intransigence [that] meant she was as often at odds with her allies as with this her enemies.\\" One from the literature on Browne can conclude that she has value to the study of women's sexuality and sexual reform that historians who have studied her believe should continue to be explored and brought to the public's attention. Legacy Stella Browne has set the stage for many arguments surrounding women's rights to sexuality and is one of the few women in history to have written works left behind that help historians to understand the interaction of socialism and feminism. This is a topic that has had very little information brought out about it, however there is a better understanding now of the \\"double struggle\\" as Rowbotham calls it, of being both socialist and feminist, while also trying to understand connections between the two. She also left behind the ALRA upon her death, which gained a flood of new members as women began to recognise the insufficiency of the current contraceptives, and the scandal that came with the effects of thalidomide. Had Browne not been one of the few talking about birth control during a time when it was a topic not to be talked about, and then women would have no birth control to contest and improve in the first place. Browne then, had a profound effect on the abortion reform, as Hindell notes in his article, \\"if ALRA had not worked steadily for many years in a hostile climate, and campaigned intensively‚Ä¶reform would not have come as early, or as radically as it did.\\" Works * Sexual variety & variability among women and their bearing upon social reconstruction, London: Printed for the Society by C.W.

He was also a Medical Officer for Health for many years in Freebridge Lynn, and was the Hunterian Professor of Comparative Anatomy and Physiology at the Royal College of Surgeons from 1890 to 1894. While a professor he gave lectures on ergot and fungi in the human body which were noted in the British Journal of Medicine.CHARLES BAGGE PLOWRIGHT M.D.: A VICTORIAN POLYMATH. Australian Postal History & Social Philately Plowright's most significant contributions were in mycology. In 1872 he published a list of 800 Norfolk fungi in the Transactions of the Norfolk and Norwich Naturalists' Society and was elected an honorary member. Starting in 1873, Plowright published a series of fasciculi (pamphlets intended to be collected into a book) titled Sphaeriacei Britannici describing members of the fungal genus Sphaeria (species modernly placed in Pseudovalsa, Macrospora, Homostegia, and others). With his collaborator William Phillips, Plowright published a series of papers titled New and Rare British Fungi (1871‚Äì1884) which described almost 300 new species. Plowright contributed to The Gardeners' Chronicle for over thirty years, writing principally on fungal diseases of plants; he was an early advocate in England of the use of Bordeaux mixture. Early in his career he made a special collection of Pyrenomycetae (now Sordariomycetes) and published several papers on them; he later moved on to the Uredinaceae, in 1889 publishing A Monograph of the British Uredinaea and Ustilaginaea. He was one of the early organizers of the British Mycological Society and served as president in 1898‚Äì9. Plowright had an interest in archaeology and published a number of articles on the subject, including several works on woad. Plowright also was active in his local community, serving as a local magistrate, director and vice-chairman of a local girl's high school, and governor of the Lynn Grammar School. Family Plowright married Mary Jane Lovie Robb, daughter of an Edinburgh merchant, and they had two children: Edith Mary (b. 1875) and Charles Tertius Maclean Plowright (1879‚Äì1935).

It is one of the three longest texts to have been found at Ugarit, the other two being the Legend of Keret and the Baal Cycle. It dates to approximately 1350 BCE. While the complete tale has not been preserved, there remain of it, according to David Wright, \\"approximately 650 poetic lines\\", with the bulk of its content concerning \\"ritual performances or their contexts\\". The remains of the story are found on three clay tablets, missing the beginning and end of the story. These tablets were discovered in 1930 and 1931. The Tale of Aqhat was recorded at Ugarit by the high priest Ilmilku, who was also the author of the Legend of Keret and the Baal Cycle. The three primary characters of the Tale are a man named Danel, his son Aqhat, and his daughter Paghat. The Narrative =First Tablet= Danel is described as a \\"righteous ruler\\" (Davies) or \\"probably a king\\" (Curtis), providing justice to widows and orphans. Danel begins the story without a son, although missing material from the beginning of the story makes it unclear whether Danel has lost children, or whether he simply has not had a son yet. On six successive days, Danel makes offerings at a temple, requesting a son. On the seventh, the god Baal asks the high god El to provide Danel a son, to which El agrees. Danel's prayers to the gods are answered with the birth of Aqhat. The grateful Danel holds a feast to which he invited the Kotharat, female divinities associated with childbearing. A gap appears in the text. After it, Danel is given a bow by the god Kothar-wa-Khasis, who is grateful to Danel for providing him hospitality. According to Fontenrose, the bow is given to Danel when Aqhat is still an \\"infant\\", while as Wright reads the tale after Aqhat has \\"grown up\\". After a missing portion of text, the story resumes as Aqhat, described by Louden as \\"now a young man\\", is celebrating a feast at which various deities are in attendance. Aqhat, who now has the bow, is offered a reward by the goddess Anat if he will give it to her. Anat offers Aqhat first gold and silver, but he refuses. She then offers him immortality, but he refuses again. As she makes her offers, she uses language that likely implies an offer of a sexual nature as well. His refusal is disrespectful: he tells her to go get a bow of her own from Kothar-wa-Hasis, and says that woman have no business with such weapons. He insists that immortality is impossible: all humans must die. Anat, outraged, leaves to speak to the high god El. =Second Tablet= Anat complains to El, according to Wright \\"apparently to receive his permission to punish Aqhat\\". El's initial response, if he gives one, is not readable due to the damaged nature of the tablet, but Anat's tone turns from an initial one of respect to violent threats against El. Reluctantly, El grants Anat leave to do as she wishes. Anat then has Aqhat killed. The character who personally kills Aqhat is Yatpan, described by Vrezen and van der Woude as \\"one of Anat's warriors\\", but by Pitard simply as \\"one of her devotees\\". Yatpan, magically transformed into an eagle, attacks Aqhat. =Third Tablet= Aqhat dies, and Anat eulogizes him, expressing regret for his death. Although the text at this point is fragmentary, it indicates that his bow has been broken in the incident, and Anat expresses her anguish over the loss of the bow as well, in even stronger terms. She also laments that, due to the murder, crops will soon begin to fail. Meanwhile, Danel, who does not realize his son is dead, continues going about his judicial duties in the city gate. His daughter Paghat notices that a drought has begun, and that birds of prey are circling their home. She feels deep sadness. At this point the text contains language about Danel's clothes being torn, indicating either that Paghat has torn Danel's clothing or that Danel has torn his own clothing in mourning over the drought. The text has Danel praying for rain, following by several lines about a drought lasting seven years, which are difficult to interpret. Danel goes out to the fields, expressing his wishes for the crops to grow and expressing hope that his son Aqhat will harvest them, indicating that he does not yet realize Aqhat has died. At this point, two young men appear and inform Danel and Paghat that Aqhat has been killed by Anat. Seeing vultures overhead Danel calls out to Baal, asking Baal to bring down the vultures so that he can cut them open to search for his son's remains. Baal complies, but Danel finds no remains. Danel sees the father of the vultures, and again has Baal bring the father of the vultures down for inspection. Again, no remains are found. Finally, Danel calls upon Baal to bring down the mother of the vultures, in which he finds bone and fat from Aqhat. Danel buries the remains he has found along the shores of the Sea of Galilee. The unjust death of Aqhat causes a years-long drought to occur. Aqhat's sister Paghat takes it upon herself to seek revenge by killing Yatpan.

It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II* listed building. History Building of the palace began before 1745, and it was completed in 1751. It was built for Samuel Peploe, Bishop of Chester. The palace was substantially expanded in the 18th century, and altered again in the 19th century but, apart from the main door, its external appearance has been virtually unchanged since the 18th century. It became the official residence of the bishops of Chester in 1865, and continued to be used for this purpose until the 1920s. It then was converted for use as a YMCA hostel, and retained this purpose until the early 1980s, when it was further converted into commercial offices. Architecture The palace is constructed in red brick with stone dressings and has grey slate roofs. It is in three storeys plus cellars, and has a hipped roof. The front of the main block facing the river has eleven bays with rusticated quoins at the corners. The fourth to sixth bays form a canted projection rising through the three storeys containing the entrance door in the ground floor. All the other bays in each storey contain a sash window. Between the ground and first floors is a stone band. Above the upper storey is a stone cornice and a brick coped parapet. There is a one-bay wing at the right end of the building. In the wing and on the sides of the building are more sash windows. The interior contains an open-well staircase with six flights and turned balusters; the balustrade has replaced a former Chinese Chippendale balustrade. On the first floor is a large room with an 18th-century decorated ceiling.

The OneTax is described as revenue-neutral, which means that it compensates for lost revenue from the income tax by closing loopholes and eliminating tax expenditures in the current income tax system. Background The current United States income tax system imposes higher costs of tax compliance than any other country, with direct costs exceeding $460 billion, and indirect deadweight loss costs of over $1.2 trillion. As this figure was calculated in 2004, it is likely that the actual current deadweight loss caused by the income tax is more than $1.4 trillion. As a national sales would create comparable deadweight loss, tax reform plans like OneTax aim to reduce or eliminate income tax compliance costs without instituting a national sales tax. History The OneTax and plans like it were first created in the 1990s by policy wonks outside the Beltway, seeking to put forward a tax simplification plan that wasn't regressive. At the time, the major tax reform proposals were the FairTax and flat tax, both of which are regressive with regards to income. The first recorded mention of this reform by a political candidate for national office was at a \\"Town Hall\\" campaign event held in Smithfield, Rhode Island in 2002. In 2011, the Republican Presidential Primary race brought tax reform proposals to the fore. In addition, discussion of the plan as a way to eliminate the income tax for \\"the 99%\\" was a topic of the Occupy Movement. Implementation The core piece of the reform is a proposed Constitutional Amendment which repeals the Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, but carves out taxes on income to remain in place for two specifically defined ways: 1\\\\. The United States federal government may tax income on those individuals earning more than ten times the per capita income as determined by the most recent census. 2\\\\. The United States federal government may continue to collect a payroll tax on all workers, the proceeds of which are earmarked for exclusive transfer to, or provision of health care benefits for, those persons aged 65 or older. Effects The primary effect is the elimination of the present personal income tax system and the elimination of 97.6% of all personal income tax compliance costs, and the elimination of more than 96% of the current deadweight loss. These two items are predicted to create an immediate boost of more than $2.1 trillion to the lagging U.S. economy. Controversy It is not in dispute that the OneTax will lead to higher effective tax rates for higher- income individuals (or it will lead to significantly lower federal spending). Many opponents of such tax changes argue that the country's highest income earners are the economy's \\"job creators\\". These opponents claim that taxing wealthy individuals at a higher rates will discourage job creation. Others argue that the current low rate of tax on capital gains encourages investment and is necessary for the long-term stability and growth of the United States and world economy. Meanwhile, still others, such as Warren Buffett claim that higher tax rates on the rich do not discourage investment and growth.

The Kensington Oval is officially regarded as the southern end of the city's Town Belt. The park, which is actually roughly triangular in shape, covers . It is bounded by Princes Street, the northern end of Anderson's Bay Road, and the Dunedin Southern Motorway. Its name dates from 22 March 1864, when it was decided to enclose the main cricket pitch within a formal oval. From that time the former name rapidly fell out of use, and has been rarely used since the beginning of the twentieth century. The first recorded first-class match cricket match was held on the ground in February 1864 when Otago played Canterbury in what was the first ever first-class match to be held in New Zealand. Otago played eight further first-class matches there, the last of which saw them play Canterbury in February 1878. The condition of the playing surface was generally unsatisfactory, with old tree roots protruding from the ground and the pitch unpredictable and at times dangerous to batsmen.The Press, 15 December 1900, p. 21. In 1879 the Otago Cricket Association requested that the Dunedin City Council make improvements to the ground. When the Council decided not to make improvements, and refused to restrict access to the ground to cricket only, the Association decided to find another venue to play at. The enclosing bounds of the oval were removed in about 1899.

Based on Spradlin and Wernick's best-selling graphic novel of the same name, the film stars Amanda Alch, Marc Donato, Augie Duke, Roger Edwards, Ali Faulkner, and Cameron Deane Stewart as six prep school students, who serve detention in a seemingly haunted school library. It had a limited theatrical release on October 27, 2012. On December 7, 2012, it was released nationwide. The film was also screened at various public destinations across the U.S. Plot A SWAT team barges into a school library to find a student holding an axe and surrounded by savaged bodies, before the film goes back eight hours previously. Six unruly prep school students are forced to serve Saturday detention for eight hours at Crestview Academy, where psychologist Dr. Day conducts psychological testing on the students to examine their personalities and trigger their demeanors, recording each session in the process. When Headmaster Nash gives an expulsion notice to low-income student Matt Clark, Matt convinces him to change it to an eight- hour detention on Saturday. Matt serves the detention with the awkward Tarek Ahmed, the jock Craig Cook, the sly Goth girl Veronica Harmon, the prissy and asthmatic Megan McDurst, and the popular girl Tricia Wilkes. For their detention, Dr. Day takes away their phones, restricts their internet reach, and gives them an assignment to write the school's history. He then locks the students alone in the school's new library, which has had some further remodeling by the janitor, Max, with his addition of Native American portraits and an Apache statue. The students believe the library is haunted. They realize they have mutually dysfunctional family lives, though they have their differences with each other, sparked from prior encounters which have been recorded on camera. Veronica hides Megan's inhaler and frames Tarek, leading to Megan having an asthma attack and dying. With limited computer access to the school's databanks, Veronica begins work on their history project. They learn how land was stolen from an Apache tribe in the 1870s by General Andrew Winston Clarke, which was then taken over by the city of Crestview to build the school. The new library was built on neighboring land that belonged to recently deceased Apache elder Jacob Rainwater. As the students argue on-and- off, they discover a vent that allows them to navigate to different rooms that are locked. They learn that Matt has an undisclosed criminal background and become suspicious of him. After Tarek goes missing and they return to the library through the vent, they learn that Tricia's mother is the governor, Craig's father is a city councilman, and Megan's father co-owns the (former Rainwater) property on which Tarek's father's company built the library, all of whom made an agreement with the school to ensure their spoiled kids would be guaranteed to graduate in exchange for gifting the library. A dark storm rages outside the school, tampering with the lights and electronics inside, increasing the students‚Äô fear that there is paranormal activity. Craig falls down the steps in the library and is staked by one of his crutches, dying instantly. Not long after, Tricia admits her mother was the reason why Rainwater lost his house, and Veronica secures evidence on Craig's camera showing that Tricia, Craig, Megan and Tarek had killed Jacob Rainwater at his home to vacate the ownership of the property, leaving no next of kin to take over. Deeply believing in the paranormal, they attempt to contact Jacob's spirit so that Tricia can call a truce, but the spirit rebels and seemingly harms Veronica. The spirit then appears, and Tricia uses a nail gun to commit suicide due to fright. Dr. Day emerges to reveal his alliance with Veronica. The whole time, they masterminded everyone's paranormal delusions and emotional outbursts, triggered by psychological inkblots tests, all to sell the story and make money. Killed by Dr. Day for trying to escape through the vent, Tarek's dead body is what was used as the ghost. Before Veronica can shoot Matt using the nail gun, Dr. Day abruptly kills her with an axe for poisoning him and causing his diarrhea earlier. Matt is framed for all the murders, as an unexpected booby trap involving the statue severs Dr. Day's head, killing him. A SWAT team barges in to find Matt armed with an axe in the middle of the carnage. Matt is subdued, placed in a straitjacket and gagged. Max the janitor arrives, revealing he is related to Jacob Rainwater. In the closing credits, Matt is driven away in an ambulance and Tricia's mother, Tarek's father and Craig's father pay off Headmaster Nash in order to clear them of any involvement in the incident.

Similar examples were eventually added by a number of Roman Catholic dioceses and by various ecclesiastical denominations overseas. Early examples The earliest regular example was seemingly the Diocesan Magazine introduced about 1867 in the Anglican diocese of Lichfield (also incidentally the centre for some of the earliest parish magazines). This was during the episcopate of bishop John Lonsdale. However it seems mainly to have been a localised version of a separate magazine, Mission Life.Derby Mercury, 22 Jan 1868, page 6 (reviews): \\"Lichfield Diocesan Magazine\\", No V, January [1868]: Derby, Bemrose & Sons; \\"Mission Life\\", January [1868]; London, Rivingtons. These works are nearly identical in their contents; certainly identical in their aims. The \\"Diocesan Magazine\\", as the title explains, is more closely connected with our diocese than the general contents of \\"Mission Life\\". Both are cheap and, as we believe, as reliable as they are interesting. They record much valuable work in a very interesting style and we should be sorry to miss them. No complete surviving copies of this early diocesan magazine are known to exist in any repository. Copies of Mission Life 1866-1869 and a new series 1870-1886 are held by the British Library. There had previously been a short-lived Oxford Parochial Magazine, but this had been neither published by nor centred on the diocese.Croft, P., The Parish Magazine Inset, 1993, During the Victorian era such publications were frequently named as the Diocesan Gazette or simply as the Diocesan Magazine. From the early 20th century many dioceses began to produce shorter monthly news bulletins or leaflets, often designed for possible inclusion as an insert within the local parish magazine. These could either replace the older magazines (sometimes being quite similar to some of the less ambitious gazettes) or alternatively might be ancillary to them. Occasionally the introduction of a new diocesan gazette might attract scepticism or controversy: in London diocese there were complaints of early high-handed techniques being used in efforts to increase their circulation.Morning Post, 14 Feb 1887: An effort is now being made, with the Bishop‚Äôs direct sanction, to compel every clergyman in the diocese not only to subscribe himself to the newly established Diocesan Magazine but also to act as its agent ‚Ä¶ surely Sir, if the Diocesan Magazine supplies a real need it will soon make its way and does not require to be pushed in such a manner as this. Format and content The Bishoprick: quarterly magazine of Durham diocese, volume 28 no. 4, August 1953. With 32 pages including advertising, its contents included three letters or recent addresses from the bishop; details of the Church Assembly and Diocesan Conference; news from the local deaneries; faculties granted; Petertide ordinations, and clerical appointments and obituaries.Formats, layouts and titles have however changed over the years to reflect the changing needs and circumstances of the church. Many of the earliest titles have now ceased publication, usually being replaced by new ventures meeting more modern needs. Some of these have now adopted a more popular newspaper-type style. Typical contents of the earlier magazines would include a pastoral letter from a bishop or another senior clergyman; theological reflections; particulars of the bishop's engagements during the coming month; comments on recent national or local news; details of forthcoming events and meetings; and particulars of recent clerical appointments. They were not always well regarded: one writer commented regarding diocesan leaflets in 1949: Unfortunately, most of these must be classed as dull productions and some ‚Ä¶ contribute little to the Christian cause and may even have a negative influence. As with the parish magazine the trouble seems to be a style of writing and a format which repels rather than attracts. But there is some excuse for the Diocesan Leaflet as many of them are written primarily for the clergy, to give them news of conferences, retreats and other events ‚Ä¶ It would be better to supply the clergy with their news in mimeograph form and devote all the Leaflet space to news of interest to the laity.J Blair-Fish, Better Parish Magazines and How to Produce Them, Press and Publications Board of the Church Assembly, 1949, (no ISBN), pages 110-111. The writer goes on quote from a recent Christian News-Letter making the following comment regarding one of these (unidentified) diocesan productions:‚Äî What does it contain ? Three articles consisting largely of funny stories of the second-rate variety with which attempts are made to enliven the dullness of clerical and secular social gatherings, an article entitled 'The Living Church' including such trivialities as how to draft a church poster announcing a forthcoming dance with the minimum number of words, two excerpts from American magazines assumed to have a certain raciness ‚Äî that is practically all, apart from a letter from the bishop describing the externals of the Lambeth Conference and giving one or two items of church news. Blair-Fish continues: ‚Äò‚ÄôThese diocesan publications have very considerable circulations, and it is shocking, if not actually scandalous, that such opportunities as they possess for positive and constructive writing should be wantonly thrown away.‚Äô‚Äô There was some gradual increase in the use of engravings and photographs, particularly after the technological improvements in the 1890s, including halftone reproduction of illustrations and the introduction of offset printing. Location of copies Surviving examples of many of these publications can often be traced in libraries or in the episcopal collections held by the local county record office or county archive service (which today usually serves as the principal diocesan record office). Since a lot of them were included as insets within parish magazines of differing dates, many of the back issues surviving today are included within incomplete sets. The British Library also holds many examples, although their integrated online catalogue British Library catalogue suggests that their overall coverage is still patchy. They do, however, also hold some magazines from Irish dioceses and from other overseas dioceses. In recent years an increasing number of dioceses have been publishing alternative versions of their latest periodicals in an online format.

The network broadcasts live and pre-recorded local, regional, and national weather forecasts and weather-related news, including periodic coverage of severe and tropical weather events. The network's studio facilities, along with its headquarters and master control facilities are located in the Denver suburb of Centennial, Colorado. History Performance One Media in 2010 acquired the WeatherNation trademarks and brand from the original WeatherNation (now Broadcast Weather), a centralized weather service for local stations and web sites. Broadcast Weather also was hired to provide weather news programming for WeatherNation channel. In March 2011, WeatherNation, Inc. and National Cable Television Cooperative (NCTC) reached a long-term carriage agreement for a national channel for a second quarter 2011 roll out. WeatherNation would gain its first broadcast television outlet by October 24, 2011, WHDT in Stuart, Florida as its primary affiliation. WIYC in Montgomery, Alabama also started carrying WeatherNation that same month. Further expansion of its broadcast affiliate body continued in January 2012, when WeatherNation added affiliates in Minneapolis, Minnesota (KARE-TV); Little Rock, Arkansas (KMYA- DT); Fort Smith, Arkansas (KFDF-CA); and Springfield, Missouri (KFFS-CA). Many of WeatherNation TV's initial over-the-air affiliates were low-power and full- power stations that were not affiliated with one of the major broadcast television networks. However, from 2012 to 2014, the network announced piecemeal agreements with two major broadcasting groups to carry WeatherNation on the subchannels of network-affiliated stations (including one which expanded upon an existing affiliation agreement with such a station). During 2013 and 2014, the network expanded its distribution agreement with the Gannett Company, owner of Minneapolis affiliate KARE-TV, to add the network on the subchannels of its stations in cities such as Atlanta (WXIA-TV), Denver (KUSA), and Washington, D.C. (WUSA). On October 27, 2014, WeatherNation TV signed an affiliation agreement with the Sinclair Broadcast Group to carry its programming on a subchannel of the company's flagship station, WBFF in Baltimore. Beginning in November 2014, additional Sinclair owned or managed stations signed affiliation agreements with the network in markets such as Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Mobile, Alabama, and Bakersfield, California. On January 14, 2014, WeatherNation launched on DirecTV channel 361 as part of a carriage dispute between The Weather Channel and DirecTV. In April 2014, the companies announced a long term agreement for the carriage of WeatherNation TV on the DirecTV platform. On April 21, 2015, Dish Network announced that it had reached an agreement to add WeatherNation onto its lineup, making it available on channel 215. On August 1, 2018, DirecTV dropped WeatherNation from its lineup. Availability =Broadcast television= , WeatherNation TV has current or pending affiliation agreements with 35 television stations in 33 media markets encompassing 21 states and the District of Columbia. WeatherNation TV is carried primarily on digital subchannels of broadcast television stations, and is carried on the digital tiers of select cable providers at the discretion of a local affiliate of the network in most markets. Most of its affiliates are full-power television stations, however WeatherNation TV is carried on low-power stations ‚Äì mainly through translators of full-power stations that carry the network ‚Äì in some areas. The national feed's carriage on certain cable and satellite providers is WeatherNation TV's sole method of distribution in markets where an over- the-air affiliate is not present. WeatherNation TV affiliates, specifically those that operate a news department, have the option of breaking away from the network's programming to carry regularly scheduled programming from the station's primary feed ‚Äì particularly, programs carried by the station's primary network affiliation ‚Äì on the subchannel in order to accommodate breaking news or severe weather coverage, or telecasts of locally produced or syndicated sports events on the primary channel (depending on WeatherNation TV's subchannel placement and the station's carriage of additional subchannel services, especially those affiliated with a major network such as The CW or MyNetworkTV). Although WeatherNation TV maintains a high-definition feed, its broadcast affiliates carry the network in 480i standard-definition in its default 16:9 widescreen format in order to preserve bandwidth to transmit the station's primary channel in high-definition; the HD feed is generally exclusive to certain pay television providers at their preference. =Pay television= WeatherNation TV's national feed began to be carried on satellite provider DirecTV on channel 361 on December 16, 2013; the provider reached a temporary carriage agreement with the network while it was renegotiating its contract with The Weather Channel (which was carried on channel 362). After DirecTV dropped The Weather Channel on January 14, 2014 due to the reasons behind Dish Network's planned removal of the channel in May 2010, the provider replaced The Weather Channel on channel 362 with WeatherNation, which lasted until The Weather Channel and DirecTV struck a new carriage agreement on April 8, 2014 that restored TWC on channel 362; however, WeatherNation TV continues to be carried on channel 361 as a result of a long- term carriage agreement it signed with DirecTV on April 2, one week prior to The Weather Channel agreement. On April 21, 2015, WeatherNation reached an agreement with Dish Network to be offered to its customers as a six-week preview, and then added to Dish's America's Top 120 programming packages. On August 1, 2018, DirecTV dropped its carriage of WeatherNation, replacing it with the AccuWeather Network. =Over-the-top providers= Pluto TV added WeatherNation in December 2018.

It was disbanded after the war and resurrected in the same role from 1951 to 1958. Its final period of service was from 1962 to 1990 when it was finally disbanded when its Piaggio Albatross aircraft were de- commissioned. History 27 Squadron was founded on 24 August 1942 at Eerste River, out of the aircrew and ground staff of 8 Squadron which had been disbanded the month before. It was placed under control of the RAF's Coastal Command and employed as a coastal reconnaissance/patrol unit, flying Lockheed Ventura Mk. IV aircraft, performing convoy escort and anti-submarine warfare patrols, or conducting operations off the South African west coast. One flight was based at Aus and the rest of the squadron flew from Walvis Bay and Rooikop in the Mandate territory of South West Africa. Between February and April 1943 a squadron detachment was deployed to Darling in the south western Cape to patrol the northern and western approaches to Cape Town harbour.On 12 April 1943, Ventura number 6457 flew into Dassenberg mountain near Darling shortly after take-off on a training flight, killing the entire crew of six. On 12 April 1988 the wreckage was discovered by members of the SAAF Museum and was airlifted off Dassenberg by a Puma helicopter of 22 Sqn. The remains are currently stored at the South African Air Force Museum. Darling Airfield in World War II The Commanding Officer of 27 Squadron, Colonel Thys Uys, has been lauded for leading the ‚ÄúSkeleton Coast‚Äù rescue when the MV Dunedin Star ran aground, and a call for aid came from the helpless men, women, and children marooned on a desert beach. The men of the South African Naval Forces, the South African Air Force, the South African Army, the South African Police, the South African Railways and Harbours Administration and, last but not least, the Royal Navy, got together and, between them, pulled off what was an amazing rescue. As Field-Marshal J.C. Smuts would write, ‚ÄúThey overcame almost superhuman difficulties and, by sheer courage and determination, saved everyone, though two of the rescuers sacrificed their lives in doing so. We salute them, one and all. They proved themselves heroes.‚Äù In June 1944, the squadron was moved to the Western Mediterranean Theatre, where their Venturas were upgraded to Ventura Mk.Vs. One flight was based at La Senia in Algeria and commenced anti-submarine patrols on 18 July 1944. A second flight was deployed to Hal Far in Malta, also on anti-submarine duties and re-joined the squadron in October 1944. In November 1944, one flight returned to AFS Swartkop in South Africa via Egypt, arriving home in January 1945. The remaining flights were converted to Vickers Warwick Vs and Vickers Wellington XIVs between February and March 1945. By this time the squadron had been moved to Gianaclis in Egypt and were flying air-sea rescue missions until this duty was taken over by the Royal Air Force's 621 Squadron. After handing over to the RAF, the squadron returned to South Africa and was disbanded in December 1945. The squadron was reconstituted at AFB Ysterplaat in January 1951 as a part-time maritime patrol unit, still equipped with Venturas Vs until 1958 when it was again disbanded. It remained inactive until October 1962 when it was re-established at AFB Ysterplaat for inshore maritime reconnaissance duties. It was initially equipped with Douglas C-47s and the squadron received Piaggio P-166S Albatross maritime patrol aircraft in 1969. On receipt of the new aircraft, the squadron moved to Cape Town International Airport from which it operated, as a maritime patrol squadron, until October 1990 when it was disbanded for the last time. The Cape Town Club maintains a wall of Memorabilia in honour of SAAF aviators fallen in defence of the Empire.

Such infections \\"are being increasingly recognized as an important cause of morbidity and blindness\\" and \\"may even be life-threatening.\\" While the cornea is believed to be the most common site for fungal eye infections, other parts of the eye such as the orbit, sclera, eyelids, and more may also be involved. Contact lens cases are recognized as a \\"potential source of pathogens associated with corneal ulcers\\" and according to Moorfields Eye Hospital, contact lens wear is ‚Äúthe most prevalent risk factor for new cases of corneal ulcers.‚Äù Contaminants \\"isolated from contact lens associated corneal ulcers have often been shown to be\\" the same as found in the patient's contact lens case, thus providing evidence contaminated contact lens cases may be a \\"replenishable source of pathogenic microbes.\\"  Research  In the study Acanthamoeba, bacterial, and fungal contamination of contact lens storage cases, ‚Äú101 asymptomatic daily wear cosmetic contact lens wearers‚Äù from one contact lens practice were studied to determine the occurrence of fungal, bacterial, and protozoal contamination of contact lens cases. The results of this study found that 24% of ‚Äúcontact lens cases were colonized by fungi‚Äù with a ‚Äúmajority growing Cladosporium species (10/24) or Candida species (9/24).‚Äù Other fungi that were also isolated include Fusarium solani, Aspergillus versicolor, Exophiala, and Phoma. Most of the fungi contaminants were also found to be associated with bacterial contaminants ‚Äúbut on three occasions, fungi were the only microbes isolated.‚Äù According to Current Perspectives on Ophthalmic Mycoses, along with the previously mentioned genus and species of fungi, other species of fungi that predominate in ophthalmic mycoses are Scedosporium and \\"dematiaceous fungi.\\" One of the difficulties stated in this study is the accuracy of assessing the identification of the genus or species of the \\"fungal strain isolated in culture.\\" In one instance, a fungal strain previously identified as Arthrobotrys oligospora in a patient was \\"later re- identified as Cephaliophora irregularis.\\" In the same patient, the fungus isolated from \\"a retained contact lens was identified as Scedosporium prolificans.\\" The issues of fungal identification observed as mentioned in this study do not pertain only to fungal contamination of contact lenses but also to the overall difficulties of fungal identification in vitro. In the study In Vitro Interactions of Fusarium and Acanthamoeba with Drying Residues of Multipurpose Contact Lens Solutions, the \\"effects of evaporation and drying of multipurpose contact lens solution\\" was observed on the survival of Fusarium. The results of the study indicate that the drying effect of the disinfectant solution was not completely able to kill off Fusarium. Fusarium was found to \\"aggregate immediately after introduction\\" of the solution, indicating the invasive nature of Fusarium. The Fusarium were found to \\"redistribute themselves\\" into \\"discrete regions of the dried residues\\" which provides evidence that the use solely of multipurpose contact lens solution to prevent fungal contamination will not suffice. Due to the findings of this study, it is suggested that regular replacement of contact lens cases is essential.  Causes  Fusarium verticillioides Genus and species widely associated with fungal contamination of contact lenses include, but not limited to: *Cladosporium *Candida *Fusarium, including F. solani *Aspergillus versicolor *Exophiala *Phoma *Scedosporium *Arthrobotrys oligospora *Cephaliophora irregularis *Scedosporium prolificans Factors which contribute to fungal contamination of contact lenses include, but not limited to, \\"hygiene negligence such as\\": *Improper sterilization and disinfection of contact lenses *Use of contaminated lenses *Contaminated contact lens case *Contaminated contact lens solution *Wearing of \\"contact lenses during eye infections\\" *\\"Introduction of micro-organisms from the environment.\\" Prevention Contact lens case should be replaced regularly Studies suggest a number of \\"recommendations for contact lens wearers to prevent contamination\\" by both bacterial and fungal contaminants which include: *Cleaning the contact lens case by scrubbing the interior of the case in order \\"to disrupt biofilms\\" *Rinsing the contact lens case with very hot water, temperatures greater than 70 ¬∞C which \\"will kill Acanthamoeba contaminants\\" *‚ÄúAllow contact lens case to air dry between uses‚Äù *If using hydrogen peroxide as a disinfecting agent, ‚Äúuse a two step system‚Äù *And lastly, ‚Äúreplace contact lens case regularly.‚Äù Diagnosis and treatment Example of keratitis Diagnosis is determined \\"by recognition of typical clinical features\\" and through \\"direct microscopic detection of fungi in scrapes, biopsy specimens, and other samples.\\" Ultimately, cultures made from the samples isolated from patients is what \\"confirms diagnosis.\\" Other tests that may also be used if needed include \\"histopathological, immunohistochemical, or DNA-based tests.\\" Pathogenesis of the fungal contaminants include a wide range of factors such as \\"invasiveness, toxigenicity, and host factors.\\" Once diagnosis is accessed, \\"specific anti-fungal therapy\\" can be administered. One of the most popular and common treatments used \\"for life-threatening and severe ophthalmic mycoses\\" is amphotericin B which is a specific anti-fungal drug. For the treatment for filamentous fungal keratitis, \\"topical natamycin is usually the first choice.\\" For the treatment of yeast keratitis, \\"topical amphotericin B is usually the first choice.\\" Current advances in further treatments include evaluations of triazoles such as itraconazole and fluconazole \\"as therapeutic options in ophthalmic mycoses.\\" For invasive fungal eye infections, scleritis, and keratitis, \\"medical therapy alone\\" is usually not enough to treat the infections due to the invasive nature of certain species. Such invasive fungi include Fusarium, Pythium, and Lasiodiplodia. For these more serious type of infections which do not respond to medical therapy will need to be further treated by \\"surgical debridement\\" and other \\"various surgical procedures.\\" Many fungal eye infections will also be associated with corticosteroids, which methods \\"to control inflammatory tissue damage\\" is being sought. Immediate treatment for fungal contaminated contact lenses is to discard the contact lenses in question and replace with brand new contact lenses. It is also recommended to replace the contact lens case as it may be a pathogenic source. Patients with eye infections caused by contaminated contact lenses should seek immediate help from a certified professional.

He promoted evangelical and progressive reform through his positions in the Mennonite Publishing Company, revival meetings and chairmanship of the Elkhart Institute (a forerunner to Goshen College). Early life John S. Coffman was born on October 16, 1848, in Rockingham County, Virginia. His parents were Samuel and Frances Weaver Coffman. He was baptized at age 16, and soon fled to Cumberland County, Pennsylvania to avoid being drafted into the Confederate Army.Coffman, Barbara F. \\"Coffman, John S. (1848-1899).\\" Global Anabaptist Mennonite Encyclopedia Online. 1953. Web. 21 October 2011. http://www.gameo.org/encyclopedia/contents/coffman_john_s._1848_1899. On November 11, 1869, he married Elizabeth J. Heatwole. Over the course of their marriage, they had seven children. One of their children, Samuel F. Coffman was a significant church leader in his own right. They purchased a 30-acre farm on Gravelly Hill. Having returned to Virginia, he obtained a teaching certificate despite limited formal education and taught at several local schools. He was chosen by lot and ordained at Bank Church, a Mennonite Congregation in Virginia. He also led singing schools in the area. Publishing Coffman was invited by John F. Funk to move to Elkhart, Indiana, where he took the position of assistant editor of the Herald of Truth in 1879. The two men shared a belief in progressive ideals and evangelism. Coffman contributed articles and editorials for that publication as well as Sunday school materials beginning in 1880. Coffman and John F. Funk collaborated on several publications such as the Minister's Manual and Confession of Faith. Coffman also served as editor and president of the Mennonite Book and Tract Society following its inception in 1889. Evangelism Coffman was distressed by the number of young people who left the church due to a lack of spiritual encouragement and guidance. He held his first evangelistic meeting series in June 1881 in Kent County, Michigan. His forceful speaking allowed him to hold similar events in Mennonite Communities across the United States and Canada. He also promoted missionary activity. Higher education Coffman was among the first Mennonite leaders to feel the need for Mennonite institutions for higher learning, especially according to the ideals of a liberal arts education. In 1895, he campaigned to sell stock in the Elkhart Institute of Science, Industry, and the Arts (now Goshen College), which had been founded by Dr. Henry A Mumaw a year earlier, and even more recently incorporated under the Elkhart Institute Association. On February 11, 1896, at the opening ceremonies of the new building (erected across the street from Prairie Street Mennonite Church), Coffman gave the address, \\"The Spirit of Progress.\\" In April that year, when the board reconvened, they voted Coffman to be president. He served in this position until his resignation on April 29, 1899. Death and legacy Coffman died at home at the age of 51 on July 22, 1899. The cause of death was a malignant growth in his stomach, from which he had suffered for a number of years. Funeral services were held in both Elkhart and Virginia.

It was last active as the 601st Air Base Wing with the Seventeenth Air Force at Sembach Air Base, Germany, where it was inactivated on 31 March 1995. The wing was first activated as the 601st Tactical Control Wing at Sembach in July 1968, when it replaced the 601st Tactical Control Group as the headquarters for Seventeenth Air Force's tactical control units and the 603d Air Base Wing as the host organization for Sembach. For most of its existence, the unit controlled elements of the Tactical Air Control SystemThe Tactical Air Control (System 407L) was developed in the 1960s by the United States Air Force as a mobile system to provide semi-automatic command and control of forces and to interface with Army and Naval Forces. It incorporated Aircraft Control and Warning, Tactical Air Support, Air Traffic Control and Command Communications subsystems. Study of the U.S.A.F. Tactical Control System, pp. 1-2 in Germany. In 1973, the wing moved to Wiesbaden Air Base, but it returned to Sembach in November 1975. Its mission changed in 1992 to supporting Air Force units at Sembach and elsewhere in Germany and it was inactivated in 1995. The wing was converted to provisional status in February 2001 and assigned to United States Air Forces Europe to activate or inactivate as required, but there have been no reports of its activation as an expeditionary unit.  History  Through much of its history the mission of the wing was to provide an effective tactical air control system for United States Air Forces in Europe and Allied Air Forces Central Europe. The wing employed a mobile radar network and forward air control flying operations. The wing controlled offensive missions against ground targets and defensive missions for air-to-air intercepts, later interfacing with Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft. =Background= The 601st Tactical Control Group had been activated at Sembach Air Base, Germany in 1965. Its staff was composed of personnel from the former 601st Tactical Control Squadron. The 603d Air Base Wing had provided support to all units at Sembach since September 1966, when the 38th Combat Support Group was inactivated as part of the draw down of the 38th Tactical Missile Wing's CGM-13B Mace missiles in Germany. The 60lst Tactical Control Wing was organized at Sembach on 1 July 1968. The new wing assumed the missions of the 601st Tactical Control Group and 603d Air Base Wing, which were inactivated. On 14 November 1968, the 86th Air Division at Ramstein Air Base, which controlled United States air defense units in Germany, was inactivated.Ravenstein, pp. 120-122 Three of its aircraft control and warning squadrons were transferred to the wing at the beginning of the month, although the 602d Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron at Giebelstadt was inactivated and its mission assumed by a German Air Force radar at Lauda.Siso, p. xiv Detachments of the wing were also organized at fixed radar sites operated by the German Air Force. Another detachment was organized at Ramstein to provide a central maintenance facility for these units.The former 86th Air Division units operated European Aircraft Control and Warning System (System 412L) fixed radars. System 412L began its deployment to both United States and German Air Force sites in 1965. Siso, p. 5.The Ramstein 412L mainenance facility was combined with the 407L maintenance operation at Sembach in February 1969. 601 TCW Chronology, 1968-1986, p. 47. =Fixed radar systems= Dobraberg fixed radar site The long term goal was to transfer operation of the 412L fixed radar sites entirely to German Air Force operation. However, it was not until 1972 that the German Air Force agreed to assume operation of the radar sites at Dobraberg Air Station and Wasserkuppe Air Station. Dobraberg was transferred on 1 July 1974, six months ahead of the agreed date. Maintenance of the remaining site at Wasserkuppe was transferred to a civilian contractor and on 1 January 1979 the Wasserkuppe site was turned over to the German Air Force and the wing's last aircraft control and warning squadron operating a fixed control and reporting postControl and reporting posts performed surveillance and early warning and controlled aircraft using radar and radio communications. Siso, p. 3 was inactivated. In September 1980 the 412L system was replaced by the German Air Defense Ground Environment system.Siso, pp. xiv-xvii The 615th Aircraft Control and Warning Squadron continued to operate a combined control and reporting centerIn addition to the functions of a control and reporting post, control and reporting centers supervised one or more control and reporting posts and identified targets. They had the authority to commit air defenses by scrambling interceptors to identify potentially hostile aircraft. Siso, p. 3 until 1980, when it was inactivated. =Mobile radar systems= Camouflaged AN/TPS-43 radar AN/TRC-97 in use in Germany AN/TRC-170 Upgrades to the wing's mobile radars began soon after activation The new two dimensional AN/TPS-44 radar to be used at Forward Air Control PostsForward Air Control Post were radar elements in forward combat areas to provide control of tactical missions. Handoff of aircraft to forward air controllers in a target area was also another function of this element. They had the capability for limited intercept and airspace control. became operational in November 1968.601 TCW Chronology, 1968-1986. In June 1969, wing Control and Reporting Posts accepted their first AN/TPS-43, three dimensional radar.Two dimensional radars determine the distance and relative bearing of a target from the radar. If the target's altitude is to be known, a separate height finder radar must be added. Three dimensional radars provide distance, bearing and altitude. However, problems arose which precluded the upgrades from being completed quickly. Lacking a firm delivery date for the radar to be used for training, Air Training Command could not establish start date for training to begin. Also, an interface kit was required to allow the use of the AN/TPS-43 until the wing received the new AN/TSQ-91V Operations Centrals with were not expected to be delivered until 1971.These were not received until February 1972. Radar sites were linked together by AN/TRC-97 wideband radios. This set provided line of sight, point-to-point communications in the German countryside. The AN/TRC-97 was eventually replaced by the digital AN/TRC-170 radio, which required substantially less maintenance. In 1969 computer programming modifications permitted 4,096 possible transponder codes for friendly aircraft radar identification. This permitted assignment of a unique code to each military aircraft in the Fourth Allied Tactical Air Force region, providing positive identification capability. In 1976 the 601st Wing expanded its mobile radar coverage to Northern Germany by activating units in the Second Allied Tactical Air Force area of responsibility in Projects Creek North and Creek Control. By year's end, the wing's mobile network grew by 40 percent. The first new sites in this expansion were at Hessisch Oldendorf Air Station, Bad Muender and Schwelentrup. Equipment for these sites came from a tactical control unit at Cannon Air Force Base, New Mexico and from Air National Guard units in Connecticut and Massachusetts. These first three new sites were a former Royal Netherlands Air Force Hawk missile battery headquarters and two of its satellite missile launch sites. The 609th Tactical Control Squadron and 6l9th Tactical Control Flight were activated at Bad Muender and Schwelentrup respectively on 1 April 1976. A month later, on 1 May 1976, the 629th Tactical Control Flight was also activated at Schwelentrup. A little less than a year later Project Creek Brahman activated three more radar units at Carl Schurz Kaserne near Bremerhaven. =Forward air control= Cessna O-2A Skymaster On 15 February 1970, the wing acquired another mission with the arrival of three Cessna O-2A Skymaster aircraft and an airborne Forward Air Control capability. The use of airborne forward air controllers was a new concept of operations for tactical air forces in Europe. The wing was assigned operational control of these aircraft, which flew from Ramstein Air Base, but that the 26th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing would be responsible for their maintenance and ground support. The first operational flight of a wing O-2A occurred on 2 March. Nine days later, the wing deployed its Skymasters to Italy for Operation Dawn Patrol 70. The 0-2s remained at Ramstein until joining the wing at Wiesbaden on 16 July 1973. In October 1973 the Skymasters were organized into the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron In July 1974, the 601st Tactical Air Support Squadron (Helicopter) joined the 20th Squadron in the 601st Tactical Air Support Group in preparation for the arrival of Sikorsky CH-53 helicopters. However, the wing's first CH-53C would not arrive until six months later. The wing's first two helicopters arrived on 15 January 1975, and flying operations commenced on 6 February. Five additional CH-53Cs were received during the 1ast two months of the year. On 21 June 1974, the wing's first two North American OV-10 Bronco aircraft were ferried to Wiesbaden Air Base from Hurlburt Field, Florida, where they were assigned to the 20th Squadron. Flying operations began on 12 July and three months later, on 10 October 1974, the 20th Squadron flew the first OV-10A forward air control mission during Exercise Certain Pledge. Additional OV-10As arrived from Thailand and, on 18 December 1974, O-2A flying operations terminated and the last Skymaster was transferred to the United States Army. Twelve additional OV-l0As arrived at Wiesbaden in August 1975, followed by 10 more two months later. On 4 July 1976, a second Bronco squadron, the 704th Tactical Air Support Squadron was activated at Sembach. Second, on 1 November 1976, wing OV-10A aircraft, pilots from the 20th TASS, and maintenance personnel from the 601st Consolidated Aircraft Maintenance Squadron deployed to Zaragoza Air Base, Spain for a four-month weapons training detachment deployment nicknamed \\"Creek Tally\\". This was the first time wing aircraft deployed to Spain for this type training. In a related operation, the 611th Tactical Control Flight also deployed their Forward Air Control Posts to Zaragoza at the same time. While there, the 611th provided radar and radio coverage for dissimilar air combat training missions between Northrop F-5E Tiger lIs of the 527th Tactical Fighter Training Aggressor Squadron and McDonnell F-4 Phantom IIs. Also, the 611th Tactical Control Flight was airlifted in two Lockheed C-5A Galaxies rather than the Lockheed C-130 Hercules or Lockheed C-141 Starlifters normally used for radar airborne movements. The major aircraft related event of 1977 involved the arrival of four additional OV-10As from the states on 9 September 1977. Also, the first two wing OV-10As to receive camouflage painting returned to Sembach from Alverca, Portugal, where the work was performed. In 1980, The 601st Tactical Air Support Group gained additional CH-53Cs and OV-10As. Due to a congressionally-imposed European troop strength ceiling, all 45 wing OV-10A aircraft along with approximately 800 support personnel of both flying squadrons (the 20th and 704th Tactical Air Support Squadrons) and much of the maintenance complex returned to the states during the period 5 June 1984 through 29 August 1984. The 45 OV-1OA aircraft previously assigned to the wing were now assigned to the 27th Tactical Air Support Squadron at George Air Force Base, California, and the wing's two Bronco squadrons (the 20th and 704th TASS) were inactivated on 30 September 1984. =Base support= 7405th Operations Squadron C-130E at Rhein-Main AB The 60lst Wing moved to Wiesbaden Air Base on 1 June 1973. Wing headquarters and tactical air control operations and maintenance units at Sembach moved to Wiesbaden as units. Support units moved to Wiesbaden without personnel or equipment and assumed the mission of the 7101st Air Base Wing, which was inactivated upon their arrival. The 7400th Air Base Group assumed their personnel to continue the operation of Sembach. By 1 October 1973, the wing's relocation to Wiesbaden was complete. =Organization= On 1 July 1973 the detachments of the 601st Tactical Control Squadron were replaced by numbered flights and squadrons and the 601st Tactical Air Control Center Squadron replaced the wing detachment operating the tactical air control center. The 601st Tactical Air Support Group was activated to command the wing's forward air control squadrons and the 601st Tactical Control Group was reactivated to command its radar units. In October, the 20th Tactical Air Support Squadron was activated and within a few months, the wing's tactical air control party detachments were transferred to the 20th Squadron. However, all these events were overshadowed by the announcement, on 8 August 1975, of Project Creek Swap, wherein the wing was notified it would again have to pack its bags and move back to Sembach. Thus, in January 1976, after a two year stay at Wiesbaden, the wing began its move back to Sembach AB. The first OV-1OA aircraft from Wiesbaden landed at Sembach on 7 January 1976, and Colonel Fleetwood Pride Jr., the wing commander, landed another the next day to officially mark the wing's return to Sembach. By 31 March 1976, the wing's move back to Sembach was largely completed. Projects Creek North and Creek Swap in 1976 involved the expansion of the group's mobile network into northern Germany and the establishment of new radar stations. The 609th Tactical Control Squadron, with two assigned flights, was activated the spring of May 1976. On 20 September 1976, a second tactical control group, the 600th Tactical Control Group, was activated under the wing to control northern operations, while its 600th Combat Support Squadron provided base support for the new radar units. The 600th Group expanded the following year when the 606th Tactical Control Squadron and two more flights were activated at Carl Schurz Kaserne near Bremerhaven. On 1 June 1985, The 65th Air Division was activated at Sembach to serve as the headquarters for the 601st and the newly- activated 66th Electronic Combat Wing. As part of this reorganization, the 66th Wing was assigned host wing responsibilities at Sembach which included support of the many geographically separated units of the 601st Wing. The 601st Combat Support Group was inactivated and its mission, personnel and equipment were transferred to the 66th Combat Support Group. The 601st Tactical Control Group was also inactivated and its subordinate units were assigned directly to the wing. =Saudi Arabia detachment= The War erupted on 22 September 1980. Shortly after, Saudi Arabia requested US assistance to ensure that Saudi Arabian airspace was not violated during the hostilities. Early in October 1980, the 601st Wing was ordered to deploy a survey team to Riyadh to assist in setting up a mobile radar network in Saudi Arabia. Tactical Air Control System elements in the United States dispatched a Forward Air Control Post, an AN/TSQ-91V Control and Reporting Post operations central cell, and a AN/TYC-10 MPC to Saudi Arabia. The radar operation in Saudi Arabia was collectively known as ELF One. ELF One involved three operating locations set up along the eastern edge of the Arabian peninsula on the coast of the Persian Gulf and in the central city of Riyadh. The Message Processing Center and Boeing E-3 Sentry aircraft operated out of the latter location. The Control and Reporting Post, along with the communications element of the Saudi Arabian Sector Operations Center, was located on Dhahran Air Base, just inland from the eastern coast of Saudi Arabia. The Forward Air Control Post operated out of Al Jubayl, also along the eastern coast of the country. Some 500 personnel were at the three operating locations. The primary mission of this operation was to support the Saudi Arabia through air defense radar surveillance of the Gulf area. The 601st Wing established an ELF One support detachment on 9 October 1980. After 11 April 1981, the detachment was supported by the 602nd Tactical Control Squadron. The detachment in Saudi Arabia was inactivated on 12 February 1986. In order to meet the Fiscal Year (FY) 1985 and 1986 Department of Defense budget restrictions, the Air Staff directed the reduction of the mobile TACS by two CRPs and four FACPs in two phases. Phase I resulted in the 1 June 1985 inactivation of the 632nd Tactical Control Flight located at Grafenwoehr and the 1 August 1985 inactivation of the 602nd Tactical Control Squadron at Turkheim and the 619th Tactical Control Flight located at Schwelentrup. The second phase of this drawdown resulted in the 1 October 1986 inactivation of the 603rd Tactical Control Squadron at Mehlingen, the 636th Tactical Control Flight and the 62lst Tactical Control Flight at Wanna and Wiesbaden, respectively. The 601st wide range of communications, which had its beginnings in World War II, was heavily tasked in support of operations during Operation Desert Storm and Operation Provide Comfort, starting with the early buildup in the Persian Gulf during August 1990. =601st Air Base Wing= The 601st air control units became an Operations Group in March 1992 that resulted in the formation of the 601st Support Wing. In 1993, more than half the 601st air control assets deployed to Italy in support of Operation Deny Flight, the United Nations-sponsored operations that established a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. The Operations Group was inactivated in October 1993 and when the wing was redesignated as the 601st Air Base Wing. At the time, the wing was responsible for over 40 geographically separated units in combination with over 200 people deployed to more than a dozen locations worldwide. In 1995 the Sembach flightline was returned to German control and the 601st Air Base Wing was inactivated.

Frank Baum for The Los Angeles Athletic Club The Lofty and Exalted Order of Uplifters or simply The Uplifters is an invitation-only social club at the Los Angeles Athletic Club founded by Harry Marston Haldeman in 1913. The club is still in existence today. Marco H. Hellman Haldeman, originally from Chicago, was a plumbing magnate and grandfather of Watergate conspirator, H.R. Haldeman. Upon his arrival in Los Angeles, he sought to create a men's club similar to his Chicago club, The Bugs . Its membership included Marco H. Hellman, Sim W. Crabill, Ralph Hamlin, Herman Paine, Sr., Ernest R. Ball, Byron Gay, Will Rogers, Walt Disney, Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable, Busby Berkeley, Leo Carrillo, Harold Lloyd, Darryl F. Zanuck, Ferde Grof√©, Eugene Biscailuz, Hays Rice, Clarence R. Rundel, Louis F. Gottschalk, and L. Frank Baum. Baum created the group's name, wrote its anthem, \\"Haldeman,\\" and scripted most of their amateur theatricals until his death, several of which were revived posthumously. In its initial stage, the Uplifters met regularly at The Los Angeles Athletic Club after construction on the 12-story clubhouse finished in 1912. They also held an infamous annual party, called the Hijinx, first in Los Angeles and later in both Lake Arrowhead and Del Mar. The men-only affair featured heavy drinking, the staging of lewd plays and outdoor sports including polo and shooting. Rustic Canyon Recreation Center, formerly the Uplifters Clubhouse, in Rustic Canyon, Los Angeles. Eventually the group moved out of the Los Angeles Athletic Club to avoid the scrutiny of prohibition, purchasing a ranch in 1920 near what is now Will Rogers State Historic Park. The ranch encompassed 120 acres and included a Spanish Colonial-style clubhouse with tennis courts, a swimming pool, trap shooting range, amphitheater and dormitories. Club members were invited to build their own getaway cottages on land leased from the club, provided they adhere to strict building guidelines. The Uplifters, long dormant, now meets regularly at The Los Angeles Athletic Club. Once an all male group, it is now run by two women. The club continues to uphold their founding motto - \\"To Uplift Art and Promote Goodfellowship,\\" - while also promoting a contemporary spirit of inclusivity, and outward-facing engagement with the DTLA community.http://laac.com/wp- content/uploads/Mercury-2016.pdf Contemporary Uplifter meetings follow the same structure and procedures set by the original membership, led by the \\"Board of Excelsiors\\" which includes a Grand Muscle (President), Elevator (Vice President), Lord High Raiser (Treasurer) and Royal Hoister (Secretary), positions and titles first devised by Baum himself.  High Jinks (Amateur Theatricals) of L. Frank Baum  These shows continued to be performed well into the 1920s. Their earliest date for performance, if known, is stated below. Lyrics from many of the songs were published in Alla T. Ford's The High-Jinks of L. Frank Baum (which was available either as a two-page pamphlet (100 copies) or a miniature book (500 copies). The songs included were from the 1938 Silver Anniversary edition of The Uplifters' Hymnal. Also included are the tongue-in-cheek by-laws (board executives are the Grand Muscle, the Elevator, the Royal Hoister, the Lord High Raiser, and the Board of Excelsiors), also written by Baum, and a list of every man who attended the first meeting. The Uplift of Lucifer was published privately in 1963 by Manuel Weltman's Wagon and Star Press, with The Corrugated Giant and historical information. He sold the books at-cost over concerns of copyright, and they have since become prized collectibles. The other plays remain, aside from the aforementioned lyrics, unpublished. *Stagecraft, or, The Adventures of a Strictly Moral Man (14 January 1914; Music by Louis F.

Biography He received his B.S. in chemistry from Brown University in 1929 and his Ph.D. in physical chemistry in 1932 from MIT under John Kirkwood and Frederick Keyes(1885 - 1976).http://www.electrochem.org/dl/interface/spr/spr95/spr95_p017-020.pdf He worked briefly as a biochemist at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research (now named The Rockefeller University) and then the Lever Brothers Company before returning to MIT in 1936 as a research associate in the Corrosion Laboratory. This was interrupted by World War II, during which time he joined the staff of the Research Laboratory at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, New York, to study metal corrosion on aircraft and other military equipment. However, he returned to MIT in 1946 as an associate professor of metallurgy and director of the Corrosion Laboratory. Uhlig became a full professor in 1953 and retired in 1972. Afterwards, he became a visiting professor for institutions around the world, including some in Massachusetts, Australia, and the Netherlands.http://www.electrochem.org/dl/hc/presidents/uhlig.htmhttps://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/24/obituaries/herbert- uhlig-86-teacher-and-expert-on-metal-corrosion.html He also served as president of the international Thoreau Society and of the Rumford Historical Society in Woburn, Massachusetts. He died in 1993. Research Uhlig's research interests were broad and included the study of passivation of transition metals, pitting and stress corrosion, hydrogen embrittlement, metal surface properties, corrosion fatigue, and corrosion-resistant alloys. In the area of passivity, Uhlig showed that the chemisorbed oxide layer is too thin to serve as an atomic diffusion barrier in electrochemical corrosion, which was the commonly held view at the time and, rather, functions to decrease the rate of the electron transfer process (oxidation-reduction reaction). He also concluded that the minimum ratio of metals corresponding to passivity in binary alloys tends to be retained in higher-order ternary and quaternary systems. For pitting and stress corrosion, he confirmed the presence of critical potentials necessary to initiate corrosion. Uhlig served as editor of the still widely referenced \\"Corrosion Handbook,\\" http://corrosion- doctors.org/Biographies/UhligBio.htm which was first published in 1948, and he authored the first edition of the textbook \\"Corrosion and Corrosion Control: An Introduction to Corrosion Science and Engineering\\" in 1963. Canadian metallurgical engineer R. Winston Revie was the editor for subsequent editions of each book. Awards and honors Uhlig served as president of The Electrochemical Society (ECS) in 1955 and, at one time, served as editor of the Journal of the Electrochemical Society. From the ECS, he received the Olin Palladium Award in 1961 and the Edward Goodrich Acheson Award in 1988. He also received several awards from societies and institutions outside the United States. The ECS named its annual outstanding achievement award the H. H. Uhlig Award in 1983. In 1982, MIT honored Uhlig by naming its Corrosion Laboratory the H. H. Uhlig Corrosion Laboratory. Since 1996, an H. H. Uhlig Award has been given annually by the National Association of Corrosion Engineers (NACE International) in recognition of outstanding effectiveness in post-secondary corrosion education.http://www.nace.org/content.cfm?parentid=1020&currentID;=1368 References  External links  Category:1907 births Category:1993 deaths Category:American physical chemists Category:Brown University alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology faculty ","title":"Herbert H.

He was widely known in New Zealand as a journalist. Early life Twomey was born in 1847 at Inchee Farm, County Kerry, Ireland. He worked at General Post Office in Cork from age 18 until he resigned for emigration to New Zealand in 1874. Before leaving Ireland, Twomey was an occasional contributor to the press and magazines. Life in New Zealand Soon after his arrival in the colony, Twomey joined the staff of the Wellington Tribune, owned and edited by W. Hutchison. Subsequently, he was employed on the Wellington Chronicle, The Evening Post, The Wanganui Herald, The Timaru Herald, and The Press in Christchurch. He purchased the Temuka Leader in 1881 and founded the Geraldine Guardian in 1883. He retired as a newspaper proprietor in 1914, but continued with occasional contributions to The Press. He married Mary Teresa, eldest daughter of Christopher Hughos, of Melbourne, in 1882, and they had four sons and four daughters. Political career In the 1884 general election, he contested the Gladstone electorate, but was defeated by the incumbent, James Sutter. He advocated a state bank, cheap money for farmers, protection of local industries, the acquisition of large estates for close settlement, working men's homes, etc. In the 1887 general election, he again contested the same constituency with Arthur Rhodes, but was defeated by 63 votes. His address on the development of the industries of the colony attracted a great deal of attention, more especially in Otago, where it was reprinted and distributed in tens of thousands for electioneering purposes. It was also published in several weekly papers and largely quoted by some of the daily papers. In the 1890 general election, he contested the Timaru electorate; five candidates stood, the incumbent William Hall-Jones got re-elected, and Twomey came third. Twomey was a firm believer in party government, and had a great objection to more than one candidate of a party standing for a seat. For this reason he has stood aside for others on various occasions. In 1896 a section of the Liberal Party in Christchurch invited him to stand for the city, but owing to the way in which the party was split up, he declined the invitation. Twomey was appointed to the Legislative Council on 18 June 1898, in recognition of his services to the Liberal Party. He served for one term of seven years until 18 June 1905. Twomey died on 1 November 1921 at his home in Temuka. He had been in poor health for the last three years.

Abushagur (; born 15 February 1951) is a Libyan politician, professor of electrical engineering, university president and entrepreneur. He served as interim Deputy Prime Minister of Libya from 22 November 2011 to 14 November 2012 in Abdurrahim El-Keib‚Äôs cabinet and was briefly elected to succeed El-Keib as Prime Minister in 2012, before failing to receive congressional approval for his cabinet nominees and being removed from office. Early life Abushagur was born in the Souq Al-Jumuah district of Tripoli on 15 February 1951. When he was a few years old, his family moved to the western mountain city of Gharyan, where they resided for sometime before returning to Souq Al-Jumuah in Tripoli.  Education  He began his education in Gharyan. When he was in second grade, he moved to Souq Al-Jumuah schools where he continued his studies until he completed high school. He then studied at the University of Tripoli where he earned a B.Sc. in electrical engineering. In 1975, Abushagur moved to Pasadena, California to continue his education at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). During his time at Caltech, he earned a M.Sc. in electrical engineering in 1977 and earned his Ph.D. in 1984.  Career  Abushagur began his academic career as a visiting professor at the University of Rochester, New York in 1984. Then he joined the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) in 1985 as an assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering (ECE) and became full Professor in 1995. While working in the ECE department, he proposed a plan to start an optical engineering undergraduate program. He went on to develop the curriculum and was the Chairman of the Optical Engineering Committee for the remainder of his time at the university. This program became the first to receive the ABET accreditation in optical engineering in the USA. During his time at UAH, Abushagur received multiple research awards and grants from several federal agencies, such as NASA, NSF, DoD and the FAA. While on sabbatical leave from UAH, Abushagur was involved in two start-up companies. The first start-up was Photronix (M) Sdn. Bhd. in Malaysia, an optical fiber component company, which he founded in 1998 with private equity. From 1998 to 2002, Abushagur was the president and CTO before returning to his position at UAH. His second start-up was LiquidLight, which was an optical networking equipment developer, which was founded through venture capital. He was the co-founder, CTO and vice president of LiquidLight from 2000‚Äì2001. In 2002, Abushagur was the founding director of the Ph.D. Program in Microsystems Engineering at the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT). In early 2007, he led the effort to establish a satellite campus in the Middle East and drove the negotiations between RIT and the Emirati government's Dubai Silicon Oasis in Dubai, UAE. The satellite campus was opened in fall 2008 and Abushagur became the founding president of RIT Dubai. Abushagur's key research areas are nanophotonics, plasmonics, photonic microsystems, adaptive signal processing, optical MEMS, optical computing, optical communications, optical interconnects and fiber sensors. He holds three patents, has published ninety-eight research papers, published a book on Fourier opticsAbushgur, Mustafa A.G. and H.

As a result of his significant contributions to the field of optics, the field of photonics and for pioneering educational programs, Abushagur was named a fellow of the Optical Society of America and the International Society of Optics and Photonics (SPIE). He also won numerous awards such as the Space Act Award from the NASA Inventions and Contributions Board in 2004, served as an editor for several professional journals and cumulatively received approximately thirteen million dollars in research grants and funding. In 2013, he received the Optical Society of America's Robert E. Hopkins Leadership Award for his \\"leadership in education and entrepreneurship, which led to establishment of important programs, institutions and companies devoted to developing optics in the United States, the Middle East and North Africa.\\" Political career In the 1970s, Abushagur became a staunch opponent of the Gaddafi regime. While at Caltech, Abushagur was actively working with other regime opposition members in the United States. Abushagur had met many Gaddafi dissidents while at the University of Tripoli, such as Abdurrahim El-Keib in 1971. El-Keib later went on to become the second interim Prime Minister of Libya during the Libyan Civil War. His contact with El-Keib, as well as many other dissidents, continued after his move to California, where many of them attended universities. This common goal of overthrowing the Gaddafi regime solidified their resolve as they all actively worked to end Gaddafi's rule of Libya for the next three decades. In 1980, Abushagur made his final visit to Libya to say farewell to his family before his Gaddafi opposition group started to openly oppose the regime. Abushagur became involved in the creation and leadership of several opposition groups, including the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (he later left the National Front in 1992). As a result of these political activities, he was placed on Gaddafi's wanted list in early 1981. Abushagur and his fellow dissidents lived in exile outside of Libya for the next thirty-two years. In May 1984, the National Front for the Salvation of Libya attempted to overthrow the Libyan regime. The failed attempt resulted in the execution of many of the Libyan dissidents who had studied in the United States, while many others were arrested.http://www.libyansfl.com Gaddafi televised their public executions and had many of the dissidents interrogated on television. During the televised interrogations, Abushagur's name was mentioned several times. These confessions caused Abushagur's family in Libya to face significant hardships for many years to follow. At the beginning of the 17 February Revolution, the National Transitional Council (NTC) began appointing representatives from the districts and cities of western Libya in an effort to create a unified front for the entire country against Gaddafi. Due to the military crackdown in the west by Gaddafi, many of the representatives that were chosen by the NTC lived abroad in order to safeguard the identities of anti-Gaddafi figures living in western Libya. Abushagur joined the delegation representing the west, central and south of Libya to Benghazi to show their support for the NTC. For the formal announcement of the NTC representatives in May 2011, Abushagur flew to Benghazi and set foot on Libyan soil for the first time in nearly thirty-two years. For the remainder of the revolution, Abushagur continued to work behind the scenes as advisor with the NTC and was a regular guest on Al-Aan TV and Al-Arabiyah TV as a Libyan affairs analyst. On 22 November 2011, Abushagur was named the Deputy Prime Minister of Libya. Two days after being named Deputy Prime Minister, he took his oath of allegiance, which stated: \\"I swear by Almighty God to perform my duties honestly and faithfully, to stay faithful to the objectives of the Seventeenth of February Revolution, to respect the constitutional declaration and bylaws of the Council, to carefully honor the interests of the Libyan people and to safeguard the independence of Libya, its security and its territorial integrity.\\" On 12 September 2012, Abushagur became the first elected Prime Minister-designate in the modern history of Libya. He was elected by a vote of the General National Congress of Libya from eight nominees. He received 96 votes in the final round of voting, against rival Mahmoud Jibril's 94 votes. While Abushagur was widely referred to as Libya's prime minister, he was never actually sworn in as he was not able to win approval from the GNC for his cabinet proposals. On the submission of his second cabinet proposal, he made an impassioned speech calling on Congress members to reject alleged partisanship and unite in support of his government. Despite this, Congress voted by a large majority to dismiss him, and he was removed from office on 7 October 2012. After losing the job of Prime Minister- designate, Abushagur continued to serve as Deputy Prime Minister until Ali Zeidan was elected by the GNC to form a government. Zeidan's cabinet won approval from Congress and he was sworn in on 14 November, relieving Abushagur of his role. =2014 Election= Abushagur was elected to the Libyan House of Representatives in the July 2014 election. He was elected for the Suq al-Juma district of Tripoli, as one of its 5 representatives. Abushagur won 14,305 votes, which was the largest number of votes won by any candidate on the general list in the entire country. He was widely expected to be elected President of the House when it first met on 4 August 2014. =Kidnapping= On the early afternoon of 29 July 2014, Abushagur was kidnapped from his home in Hay al-Andalus by an armed group, who were travelling in several vehicles, including an unmarked ambulance. The group reportedly forced him at gunpoint into the unmarked ambulance, in front of his wife, daughters and another relative. As Abushagur was being driven away with a gun pointed at his head, a relative who was present at his home attempted to follow them in his personal vehicle; however, two other vehicles that were involved in his abduction moved in and blocked the road, preventing him from pursuing. Abushagur was released at approximately 3:00am on 30 July. Abushagur was released unharmed, with no ransom being paid. The following day, Abushagur held a press conference at the Rixos Conference Hotel where he accused the Zintani militia group as Barq Al- Nasr (Victory Lightening) as being behind his 9-hour kidnapping. Abushagur claimed that the ambulance he had been forced into took him to a barracks in the Swani area of Tripoli. He stated that his captors repeatedly asked him to reveal unspecified information. He claimed that he was also accused of being a member of the Muslim Brotherhood; an accusation which he denied. After being asked by his captors whether he supported General Haftar's Operation Dignity, Abushagur replied that he did not support any operations outside the state. He also claimed that his captors accused him of being wealthy and demanded 20 million Libyan dinars. After several hours of interrogation by his captors, he was escorted to a jail cell and remained there for several hours. Some time later, he was removed from the jail cell and a few hours later he was released. At the conference Abushagur stressed that his kidnappers did not physically harm him, and also stressed that he believed the militia was not acting on behalf of the city of Zintan, but were instead acting on their own initiative. Abushagur claimed that he was freed after another Zintani suddenly released him, and stated that he was still unsure of the reasons for his abduction. At the end of his statement Abushagur refused to take any questions. In late August 2017, Abushagur resigned from the Libyan House of Representatives (HoR), accusing it of blocking the implementation of the Libyan Political Agreement (LPA).

He won seventeen times in a career that lasted from 1909 until 1911, taking major races at two, three and four years of age. Lemberg won his most important victory as a three-year-old in 1910 when he won The Derby. His career was marked by his rivalries, first with the fast and precocious Neil Gow and later with the outstanding middle-distance runner Swynford. Lemberg went on to have a successful career at stud. Background Lemberg was bred by his owner Alfred W. Cox who raced his horses under the name of ‚ÄúMr. Fairie‚Äù. He was sired by Cyllene, an Ascot Gold Cup winner, who went on to become a highly successful stallion. In addition to Lemberg, he sired three other winners of The Derby and through his grandson, Phalaris, he is the direct male-line ancestor of most modern thoroughbreds. Lemberg‚Äôs dam, Galicia was an outstanding broodmare. In the year before Lemberg‚Äôs birth she produced Bayardo, the best British horse of his era, and later produced Kwang-Su, who finished second in the Derby. Lemberg was one of sixteen Classic winners trained by Alec Taylor, Jr. at Manton in Wiltshire. Racing career =1909: two-year-old season= Lemberg was the one of the two best British two-year- old of his generation. After running impressively in a private trial he was sent to Royal Ascot where he started favourite for the New Stakes and won by one and a half lengths. Lemberg followed with odds-on victories the Chesterfield Stakes at Newmarket and the Rous memorial Stakes at Goodwood before being sent to Doncaster for the Champagne Stakes in September. He again started odds-on but finished third of the four runners behind Neil Gow. He returned to his best form in autumn at Newmarket, winning another Rous Memorial Stakes over five furlongs by a neck from the filly Yellow Slave, to whom he was giving seven pounds. At the same course he then took the Middle Park Stakes giving three pounds to the future American champion Whisk Broom and winning by a neck. At the same course two weeks later he again defeated Whisk Broom, this time by five lengths, in the Dewhurst Stakes, and went into the winter break as favourite for the following season‚Äôs classics. =1910: three-year-old season= Bernard Dillon who rode Lemberg to his Derby win Before the season began, there was much speculation concerning the riding plans of the jockey Danny Maher. According to reports in the Telegraph he was offered ¬£3,000 to partner Lemberg, with a rival offer of ¬£5,000 if he was successful in the Derby on Neil Gow. He eventually decided to ride Neil Gow, although he rode Lemberg in later races. Lemberg began his three-year-old season by running in the 2000 Guineas. He started 7/2 second favourite and was beaten a short-head by Neil Gow in a ‚Äúsuperlative‚Äù driving finish. Although he been beaten by Neil Gow on both their meetings, Lemberg looked to be the better potential stayer, and was the more fancied for the Derby. At Epsom he started 7/4 favourite in front of a crowd estimated at 250,000, many dressed in black as a mark of respect to the recently deceased King Edward VII. Ridden by Bernard Dillon he tracked the leader, Greenback, throughout the race before taking the lead in the closing stages and winning by a neck in a race record time of 2:35.2. Neil Gow became agitated and gave trouble at the start before finishing fourth. Among the unplaced horses was Lord Derby's Swynford, making his first start of the year. Lemberg beat an supposedly \\"moderate lot\\" by three lengths to win the St James‚Äôs Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, with Swynford, among the beaten horses. Lemberg then started favourite for the Grand Prix de Paris at Longchamp. He led the field into the straight before tiring on the heavy ground and finishing fourth to Nuage. At Sandown in July he faced Neil Gow in a much anticipated race for the Eclipse Stakes, then the most valuable race in England with a prize of ¬£10,000. The two colts dominated the race and contested the finish ‚Äútooth and nail‚Äù before finishing in a dead- heat. Lemberg was reported to be working poorly before the St Leger and finished third, beaten a head and one and a half lengths by Swynford and Bronzino. Danny Maher, who rode Lemberg on this occasion, was felt by some to have ridden a poor race. In autumn he added the Jockey Club Stakes scoring an easy win from Dibs and seven others, and then beat the prolific handicap winner Dean Swift in the Champion Stakes. Lemberg started twice more before the end of the season, winning the Lowther Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Newmarket and the Sandown Foal Stakes: on each occasion he started odds-on and won easily, giving weight to inferior opposition. =1911: four- year-old season= As a four-year-old Lemberg produced his best form on his debut, when he reversed the St Leger form with Swynford by winning the Coronation Cup at Epsom. He then started odds-on favourite, but was beaten by Swynford in the Princess of Wales‚Äôs Stakes at Newmarket, when attempting to give five pounds to his rival. Before the Newmarket race \\"Mr Fairie\\" had estimated Lemberg's value at least ¬£40,000, saying that the colt could win at least that figure on the racecourse. He was later reported to have turned down an offer of ¬£55,000. In the Eclipse Stakes, however, Swynford proved his superiority over Lemberg at level weights, winning by five lengths. Lemberg returned in the autumn and successfully moved up in distance to win the Doncaster Cup over two and a quarter miles. He was then asked to give two stones in weight to the top-class three-year-old Stedfast in the Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket and finished second, beaten four lengths. Late in the year he won the Champion Stakes for the second time in anti-climactic fashion; he was allowed a walkover when no other horses opposed him. On his final start Lemberg won the Lowther Stakes again, easily beating his one moderate rival. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Lemberg a ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù Derby winner and the seventy-sixth best British racehorse of the 20th Century .Randall, J and Morris, T. . Portway Press, 1999, p. 137 Stud career Retired to the Hamilton Stud at Newmarket, Lemberg became a successful stallion and was Britain‚Äôs Champion sire in 1922. Among his best progeny were the Classic winners Pogrom, Ellangowan and Taj Mah. Lemberg died at the age of twenty-one in 1928. Pedigree * Lemberg was inbred 3 √ó 3 to Isonomy.

She acquired softball experience while playing in the county softball league for 12-to 15-year-olds and then in an industrial league for two years. In Kenosha, she gained a good reputation as a hard throwing pitcher and shortstop for the team of Nash Motors, which later buy Hudson Company to found American Motors.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball ‚Äì Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland & Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English. Hill entered the league in 1945 with the Grand Rapids Chicks, but was converted into a catcher. She was a force behind the plate and had capacity as a left- handed hitter to drive the long ball. Nevertheless, Hill was traded six times in a span of eight years because each season the league would move players to try to keep teams competitive. So, in 1946, she divided her playing time between the South Bend Blue Sox and the Fort Wayne Daisies, before stabilizing with the Peoria Redwings the next year.Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball Hill became the everyday catcher for Peoria in 1947. While she turned in a good defensive performance, she also showed a strong throwing arm and the ability to get the most out of a pitching staff. She then found herself on the move again, this time to the Racine Belles during the 1948 midseason. Through 1949 she shared catching duties with Irene Hickson, returning to Peoria from 1950 to 1951. While Hill loved to catch, she also suffered a litany of injuries that hurt her play. She recalled one game in which she had four broken fingers taped on her throwing hand. During the off-season, she continued to work for the Nash Company.Madden, W.C. The Women of the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League: A Biographical Dictionary.

Joyce rejoined the Blue Sox during her last year in the league. Near to the end of the 1952 season, a South Bend team decimated by injuries had lost six regular players. Then she won a decisive game with a walk-off RBI single in the bottom of the ninth inning.

It is about a killer and a bodyguard who against all odds eventually become friends. Plot During her election campaign governor Londsdale (Sue Flack) is shot at by a sniper as she speaks in public. John Ridley (Til Schweiger) confounds the first attack but when he is running for cover with his client in tow, they are still under fire and his colleague is hit in the open. Lonsdale urges Ridley to save his friend, although this means to turn his back on her for a moment. He complies eventually and hereby makes it possible for a killer (Chazz Palminteri) to approach Lonsdale and to kill her for Ridley to see. Ridley consequently retires as a body guard, henceforth being haunted by nightmares and left by his wife who couldn't cope with him any longer. Only years later he reluctantly agrees when his former boss persuades him to take on a last mission in Barcelona. Ridley is gobsmacked when he meets the chief witness he is supposed to protect for it is the very man who has ruined his life. However, the former killer Lee Maxwell (Chazz Palminteri) is about to die of cancer and is desperate to make it up with his daughter Catherine (Cristina Brondo). Seeking redemption by being a witness against the villain Victor Tolkin (Nick Brimble) the former killer has made himself a target. Ridley tries to fight them off but in the end it is revealed that his boss has doublecrossed him and that he has hired Ridley solely because he expected him to fail again. Supported by his old brother in arms Mark Graver ( Llu√≠s Homar) and the increasingly weakened Maxwell, Ridley stands up to Tolkin's henchmen.

While a member of the Upper House, he was the leader of the party group in that house 1965-1968. From 1965 to 1970, he was the party leader of the Party of the Right (H√∂gerpartiet), that in 1969 changed its name to the Moderate Party (Moderata samlingspartiet). During Holmberg's time as leader, his party saw declining support in face of a left-wing wave in the late 1960s. Following a very poor result for the Moderate Party in the 1970 general election, Holmberg's position was challenged by the party's vice chairman G√∂sta Bohman, who won the vote at the party congress.

Pandora was founded in 1985 By Steve Brett and Martin Greenwood, later Aine Marsland joined the team and took over the administration of the company. Pandora International devices are able to colour-correct video and 16 mm and 35 mm motion picture film in real time. Pandora International is based in Greenhithe, Kent, England.pandora- int.com contact  Pogle Colour corrector  Pandora Int. was the maker the Pogle colour corrector controller. The Pogle can control a Telecine machine, like the FDL60 the first digital telecine. New models could control FDL 90, Quadra and Spirit DataCinesthameside.tv Spirit DataCine Pogle used customized external control panels. The Pogle also included a VTR deck controller which was capable of controlling up to four video tape decks for field accurate editing including 3/2 sequence control. Other systems made do with a separate computer system [e.g. TLC] for this function. Pogle has a CPU rack which used twin Motorola 68020 CPU's and a telecine interface rack which varied depending on the make and model of the Telecine system in use. The first Pogles controlled the telecine's internal colour corrector. Originally Pogles used a PDOS operating system which was quickly replaced with a proprietary system named ANDIX. The program and list are stored on a SCSI hard disk, with backup to a 3.5\\" floppy disk. Video display is to a multi-sync monitor. The newer operating system updated to a Silicon Graphics (SGI) platinum operating system ran on a SGI Indy computer and later an SGI O2; these replaced the internal CPU and video cards in the Pogle controller rack. The Indy computer and O2 computer's backup is usually to an external zip Drive or ext. floppy. The O2 has an internal CD-ROM. Pandora's DCP external colour corrector is a Rec. 601 digital system so some telecine's [e.g. FDL60] which only had analog output's had to first send their signal to an external analog-to-digital converter.Pogle history web site  DCP  DCP or Digital Color Processor was a standard-definition digital video processor controlled by a Pogle. DCP was one of the first commercially available systems which was built entirely with digital circuitry using programmable logic. Until this time most color manipulation [including the circuity within Telecine machines] was predominantly analog. With the DCP, primary [e.g. Lift/Gamma/Gain] and secondary [Zonal and Hue based] colour processing could be done outside the telecine and so input could be from film or video tape. Standard definition processing was of NTSC and PAL video.patentgenius.com DCP patent The DCP was a modular system so over the life of the product various add-on's and upgrades were made including the \\"Electric Sunroof\\" option. This was launched in direct competition to the \\"Power Windows\\" feature from DaVinci System in Florida. It enabled multiple secondary colour corrections to be applied each within a separate area of the image. ESR windows featured an advanced keying system which allowed the user to identify the areas of the image using Hue, Saturation and Luminance keys combined with the physical position of pixels on the screen.  PiXi  The Pixi Colour Corrector was launched in 1995 and replaced the DCP. Pixi was a High Definition colour corrector and so could handle video resolutions up to 1920x1080 at 30 frames per second. The feature set was similar to the DCP but upgraded in many ways. For example, the Pixi also provided circularly shaped windows and vignettes rather than just squares and rectangles. A version of Pixi was incorporated into the Picasso system from Post Impressions Ltd (later purchased by Snell & Wilcox). This was an HDTV capable disk server designed to handle 10bit RGB signals. Industrial Light & Magic purchased one of these systems for use on Star Wars episode I \\"The Phantom Menace\\" and another for episode II \\"Attack of the Clones\\".Picasso Colour Correction System  MegaDEF  In 1997, Pandora introduced the MegaDEF system. MegaDEF uses two PiXi chassis with an additional multiplexer rack. MegaDef was the first commercially available system that was capable of working at full 2K resolution [2048 x 1556] in real time [up to 30fps]. The MegaDEF could be used with both the Spirit DataCine and the Specter VDC-2000 virtual telecine. MegaDEF was controlled with a Pogle Platinum controller. In the virtual telecine this data was playing off a Storage area network - SAN through the VDC-2000.kodak.com \\"Restoration of an impeccably preserved old negative\\" What many people do not realise is that MegaDef connected to the Spirit or Specter machines internally using a special interface that was jointly developed by Philips [manufacturer of Spirit] and Pandora. This meant that the images from film [or disk] were always processed at full 2K resolution before being converted to HDTV or SDTV formats. In this way the accuracy of the internal keyer's and other image processing was greatly enhanced as they were in effect always over sampling the video image. *The 1998 Movie Pleasantville (film) was processed using a MegaDef system, this featured many scenes in which selected colours were removed. * Specter - VDC - Virtual DataCine. In 1999 Philips introduced the Specter the first virtual telecine. It is able to colour correct, re-size and grain reduce 2K DPX files in real time. Used in DI work and to make multiple video formats off one film transfer scan (PAL, NTSC, Pan scan, letter box...). This was accomplished by playing the DPX files back through the Spirit Datacine's process electronics and a Pandora MegaDef Colour Correction system.theasc.com, ¬© 2003 American Cinematographer, DI by Debra KaufmanAmerican Cinematographer A flex Finish *The 2000 movie O Brother, Where Art Thou? was scanned with Spirit Datacine, colour-corrected with a VDC-2000 using a Pandora Int. Pogle Colour Corrector with MegaDEF at Kodak's Hollywood Cinesite facility. A Kodak Lightning II film recorder was used to record the data output back to film. This process helped change the trees and grass backgrounds from green to a yellow/brown, creating the 1930s \\"Dustbowl\\" effect wanted by the Coen Brothers and cinematographer Roger Deakins. Pandora was awarded an Emmy in 2001 for MegaDef in recognition of its pioneering work in developing the concept of Digital Intermediate.2001 Emmy Awards Other versions of MegaDef were interfaced to the Quantel iQ system using an optical fiber using a proprietary connection protocol known as \\"FreeFlow\\". This system was also capable of operating in real time at 2048x1556 resolutions as well as standard TV formats.

It is native to North America, where it is widespread in Western Canada, the Great Plains, the central and Western United States, and Chihuahua in northern Mexico. This cactus grows in a wide variety of habitat types, including sagebrush, Ponderosa pine forest, prairie, savanna, shrublands, shrubsteppe, chaparral, pinyon-juniper woodland, and scrub. Description Opuntia polyacantha grows up to tall. It forms low mats of pads which may be wide. Its succulent green pads are oval or circular and reach wide. Its areoles are tipped with woolly brown fibers and glochids. Many of the areoles have spines which are quite variable in size and shape. They may be in length, stout or thin, straight or curling, and any of a variety of colors. The flowers are long and may be yellow or magenta in color. The fruit is cylindrical, brownish, dry and spiny. The cactus reproduces by seed, by layering, and by resprouting from detached segments. In its natural range it survives throughout an immense range of temperatures, ranging from in the Yukon Territory, Canada, to well above in places like Chihuahua, Mexico. There are many expressions of O. polyacantha and variation is common. Multiple varieties have been proposed. Some are accepted by modern authorities and some require further study. Uses Native Americans used it as a medicinal plant, with different parts treating various symptoms.University of Michigan - Dearborn: Native American Ethnobotany (Opuntia polyacantha) This pricklypear provides food for many types of animals. It provides over half the winter food for the black-tailed prairie dog in one area. Pronghorn antelope eat it, especially after the spines are burned off in wildfires. Ranchers intentionally burn stands of the plant to make it palatable for livestock when little other food is available. It will also grow in waste areas where good forage will not take hold. In fact, an abundance of the cactus indicates land that is poor in quality. Several insects attack the cactus, including the cactus moth Melitara dentata, the blue cactus borer Olycella subumbrella, and the cactus bug Chelinidea vittiger. O. polyacantha provided the Lewis and Clark Expedition with opportunity for admiration and more often complaint about the plant.http://www.lewis-clark.org/article/3121 With the skin and seeds removed, the fruit can be eaten raw or made into candy.

This would have been where the episcopal registers, administrative papers and title deeds were preserved under the general superintendence of the diocesan chancellor. In modern usage it generally refers to an approved repository, frequently operated by a local authority, which has been specially designated by a Church of England bishop for the collection and preservation of historic archives, both from the diocese and also from local ecclesiastical parishes. Historical background The Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1929 permitted bishops to designate such places as approved repositories for parish records. A new Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978 made it obligatory to designate at least one diocesan record office in each diocese of the Church of England. Usually the diocesan record office will now be within a city record office or an ordinary county record office. However, there are some exceptions: the Canterbury Cathedral Library and the Borthwick Institute for Archives at the University of York are similarly designated.HMSO: Record Repositories in Great Britain, a geographical directory, 1992 ) The Parochial Records and Records Measure relates solely to the Church of England. Other churches within the Anglican communion, in Scotland, Wales and elsewhere, normally operate in accordance with their own specialist legislation ‚Äì as do many other Christian denominations. The status of various Welsh county record offices as diocesan record offices was the result of an agreement with the Representative Body of the Church in Wales, made in 1976, which gave Welsh parishes the option of claiming facsimile copies of their deposited registers.Veysey, A.G.

Since learning to cast as a schoolgirl in 1937, she has left a legacy for new generations of fly anglers and taught countless people the art of fly-casting through the school she founded and books she has written. Her demystification of the fly cast, numerous career accolades, and many contributions to the sport have earned her induction into the International Game Fish Association Hall of Fame (2007) and American Casting Association Hall of Fame. She has garnered 20 awards, including the Lapis Lazuli and Lifetime Achievement Awards from the International Federation of Fly Fishers. She was a National Casting Champion from 1943‚Äì1960. In distance casting against an all-male competition, she made a record cast of 161 feet.  Early life and angling career  Joan Wulff was born in Paterson, New Jersey.As of May 2017 she is 89 years old: Virtuoso; Jan Fogt; May 16, 2017 Throughout her childhood, she recalls that family life revolved to a large extent around her brothers' and father's interests in fishing and hunting, as well as the family's local outfitting shop, Paterson Rod & Gun. This exposure to fishing at a young age proved instrumental to the development of her longstanding passion for angling. \\"I became hooked on fishing at the age of five or six, accompanying my parents one bass-fishing evening. Dad fished with a fly rod; mother rowed the boat. Things came together and a bass exploded from under the lily pads to take Dad's bass bug. The bass and I got hooked at the same time.\\"Wulff, Joan S. Joan Wulff‚Äôs New Fly Casting Techniques. Lyons Press, 2012. When she was 10, Wulff asked her mother if she could borrow a bamboo fly rod belonging to her father, whom she admired and adored. After a few attempts at casting, the rod came apart at the ferrule, and the top section slid into the water. Fearing her father's reaction, she and her mother summoned a neighbor to retrieve it with a rake. When Wulff‚Äôs father found out what had happened, far from being angry, he bought Joan a rod of her own, and showed her how to use it. There was no turning back. After her first fly-casting lessons from her father, she further developed her technique under the guidance of mentor William Taylor and instructors at the Paterson New Jersey Casting Club. Within two years, Wulff was the New Jersey Sub-Junior All Around Casting Champion. Even with her 5-foot stature, she could cast a 5-weight fly rod single-handedly, hitting targets 50 feet away. ‚ÄúShifting my weight, I used my body to lengthen the stroke,‚Äù says Wulff, who enjoyed testing her mettle against male contestants. ‚ÄúShe could outcast just about any man,‚Äù says New Jersey outdoor writer Al Ristori, who as a kid frequented Paterson Rod & Gun. In the 1930s, distance and accuracy casting was a popular sport, and her father Jimmy Salvato ‚Äî a New Jersey game and fish commissioner and outdoors writer ‚Äî was one of the best. At 16, Joan was crowned New Jersey State Champion, and competed in her first national championship, in Chicago. With her Scottish-born mother, Alexina Sampson Salvato, cheering her on, Wulff won the first of what became 17 national titles from 1943 to 1960. Between 1943 and 1960, Wulff crisscrossed the country, driving to casting competitions and outdoors shows, and achieving milestones and celebrity. In 1945, American Magazine published a story about her, ‚ÄúNo Flies on Joanie,‚Äù and she was featured on the cover of Pennsylvania Angler. In 1947, she scored 99 out of 100 points at a national accuracy championship. That year, she achieved a personal best with a 120-foot cast in one of her first distance-casting contests. Four years later she rattled the sporting world when she took the National Fisherman‚Äôs Distance Fly title with a 9-weight rod against an all-male field with a record (for a woman) cast of 131 feet. ‚ÄúAny time a female can achieve the record distance of a man takes tremendous skill,‚Äù said world champion fly caster Steve Rajeff. ‚ÄúJoan was fantastic. Her records inspired this generation of women casters.‚Äù Life became a succession of road trips for Wulff, wowing crowds around the country, sometimes in heels and a cocktail dress. In addition to competitive distance casting (spinning and plug, as well as fly), she was known for trick casting. With a fly rod, she sliced bananas, broke balloons, even snapped a cigarette from the mouth of emcee Johnny Carson on the television game show Who Do You Trust? In the 1960 New Jersey State Casting Championship, Wulff unleashed a 161-foot cast that would have been a record for women, had there been such a category.  Wulff School of Fly Fishing  In 1978, she and husband Lee Wulff, moved to Lew Beach, New York, and the upper Beaverkill River, where Joan realized her dream of opening a fly-fishing school. Teaching was a shared passion, something they had done sporadically before opening the school. Joan created a curriculum and terms that broke the cast into parts. ‚ÄúShe coined the term ‚Äòpower snap‚Äô as a description for ending the stroke to form the loop and ‚Äòdrift‚Äô to describe the follow-through of the back cast and repositioning of the rod between the back and forward strokes. Technically, she‚Äôs the most proficient caster I‚Äôve ever seen. And a master teacher‚Äù, said master fly instructor Brandt. Miami-based master instructor Chico Fernandez agreed. ‚ÄúShe can correct casting subtleties in people at the highest level, and with the same focus and contribution, help beginners,‚Äù Fernandez says. After the death of husband Lee Wulff in April 1991, Joan was grief-stricken and concerned about the future of the school in the absence of Lee. She was 64. Joan Salvato Wulff and her school would not fail. Friends rallied around her, including one of Lee‚Äôs closest, lawyer Ted Rogowski of the Environmental Protection Agency. Robert Redford‚Äôs film A River Runs Through It was released the year after Lee‚Äôs death, and its impact on the school was profound. Unheralded numbers of women filled all 10 sessions, anxious to capture the magic of fly-fishing. With Joan as their guide, it was easy. ‚ÄúShe‚Äôs grace, beauty and intelligence all in motion,‚Äù said a former student and professional guide, Lori Ann Murphy. With so many female students, Joan hired prot√©g√© and nurse practitioner Sheila Hassan of Boston to instruct. She joined the school in 2003 and became chief instructor in 2008. When it comes to the mechanics of the cast, no one has risen to Joan‚Äôs level of detail, Hassan observes. ‚ÄúAt a time when so many people are retiring, it‚Äôs inspiring to see Joan teaching at such a high level,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThe way she can look at someone‚Äôs cast and identify how to improve, it is amazing. She‚Äôs a one-in-a-million teacher.‚Äù  Editorial and publishing career  In the 1980s, Joan‚Äôs talents landed her a casting column that ran successfully for 22 years in Fly Rod & Reel magazine. Lee and publisher Nick Lyons encouraged her to write a book on fly-casting, which she agreed to do. Joan attacked the project with her usual intensity. Her goal was to explain the cast in terms even a novice could grasp. During one off-season in Florida, she began to dissect it, unraveling the science of fly-casting, with Lee constantly challenging her for better explanations. It was a painstaking process. It took two years to complete the book, coining terms that described the cast. ‚ÄúLoading move,‚Äù for example, describes the first part of the stroke and ‚Äúpower snap‚Äù the end of it. She addressed the physicality of casting, describing muscle movements. The end result, the revolutionary Joan Wulff‚Äôs Fly-Casting Techniques, was first published in 1987. With its pioneering casting mechanics, the book was heralded by magazine editors, students and professionals as a classic that made fly-casting accessible to everyone. It has been acclaimed as one of the best fly-casting instructional books ever written. Joan Wulff‚Äôs New Fly-Casting Techniques was published in 2012, subsequently followed by a second edition in 2016. Her instructional video, Dynamics of Fly Casting, is an ongoing success.  Royal Wulff Products  Joan co-founded Royal Wulff Products in the 1980s with husband Lee Wulff. As an avid fisherman and renown inventor, Lee had previously pioneered many firsts in the world of angling, including the invention of the pocketed fly- fishing vest in 1931, and the use of long-lasting animal hair (rather than chicken feathers) in heavier-bodied dry fly patterns such as the Royal Wulff. Lee Wulff also pioneered hook-embedded polystyrene fly bodies. With these Form-A-Lure flies, traditional feathers and hair were embedded in the plastic, simplifying conventional fly making. Presently, Royal Wulff Products specializes in offering innovative products for angling including unique tackle, fly lines, backing, fluorocarbon leaders and tippet material, fly line dressing, instructional materials, casting aids, and limited-quantity custom- made bamboo fly rods.  Present day  Joan continues to operate the Wulff School of Fly Fishing as a dedicated mentor and teacher. When not traveling, she offers personal instruction to students at the school, located in the Catskills (the birthplace of dry-fly fishing in America on its best known river, the Beaverkill). The Wulff School resides on 100 acres in the upper Beaverkill Valley among beautiful settings of forest, meadow, and ponds. It has an adjoining private stretch of the Beaverkill used to teach wading, streamcraft, and obstacle casting. The company, which she co-founded, Royal Wulff Products, is now run by Joan‚Äôs son, Douglas Cummings.

The route is paved with three different pavement types, and is not a part of the National Highway System. It was first designated as US-81 Alternate in the early 1970s with the designation being changed to K-143 in the early 1980s.  Route description  I-70 at exit for K-143 K-143 begins at an interchange with Interstate 70 in the northernmost parts of Salina, Kansas. For the first of the route, the highway travels due north through commercial and agricultural land within the Salina city limits. A short distance after this, K-143 transitions from a divided four-lane highway into a two-lane highway. It then crosses the Saline River and continues north through primarily agricultural land north of Salina. At , K-143 turns northwest and follows a gently curving path in that direction for the remainder of the route, ending at an interchange with US-81. K-143 has an AADT of 4,133 vehicles in the southernmost of the route, with an AADT of 1,580‚Äì1,595 vehicles in the remainder of the route. The route is paved with a combination of full-design bituminous pavement, composite pavement, and partial-design bituminous pavement. K-143 is not a part of the National Highway System.  History  K-143's route was established between 1970 and 1971 as US-81 Alternate. The numbering was changed to K-143 between 1981 and 1983.

There are three deposits: Central Pit, Mashi and Kinsevere Hill. These are mostly stratiform deposits in alternating dolomitic and terrigenous formations. The dolomitic rocks that underlay the formations are excellent aquifers. For the year of 2011, Anvil expected to produce between 36,000 and 38,000 tonnes of copper as copper cathodes and copper in concentrates. Anvil was completing construction of a $400 million SX-EW plant to extract the copper, and the Heavy Media Separation plant was scheduled to shut down at the end of June 2011. After the upgrades, the mine is expected to produce about 60,000 tons of copper annually. Anvil is studying the potential for further increasing the rate of production. In 2012 Minerals and Metals Group made a successful takeover bid for Anvil worth $1.3 billion.

It was then used by the Caledonian as a strategic link to access Nithsdale and the Portpatrick line by running powers over the Glasgow and South Western Railway (GSWR).Thomas & Paterson (1984), page 151 In its early days Lochmaben station had a single platform on the south west side of the running line with a goods yard behind the platform. There was a goods warehouse, cattle pens and a crane. By 1899 the station was situated on a passing loop and there were two platforms either side of it. The station building in the Scottish baronial style with crow steeped gables, along with a substantial stone goods shed. By 1899 a road over bridge was built to replace the level crossing of the Beattock road north out of Lochmaben. Doubling of the line was proposed but never constructed. In 1923 the line became part of the London Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS) following the Railways Grouping of 1923, since the LMS also took over the GSWR line to Dumfries via Annan the Dumfries to Lockerbie line lost its strategic importance, and a gradual decline set in. Lochmaben lost its signal box in the 1930s as an economy measure and subsequently the loop line was lifted.

It became a rendezvous of radical intellectuals and artists of Calcutta, including those with extreme left sympathies. It stayed alive for more than thirty years and published a number of books that would later become classics in their respective fields. At present, the stewardship of the organization is in the hands of Mr. Dulal Burman, Dr. Amit Podder and Mr. Asit Poddar. Left ideology, drama and folk art  Abani Ranan Ray originally hailed from the Bankura district of West Bengal. Till 1952, he had been associated with the Bombay (now Mumbai) unit of the Indian People's Theatre Association, where he was very close to stalwarts like the linocut artist Chittaprasad Bhattacharya (1915‚Äì1978). In 1952 he came to Calcutta. In the 1950s West Bengal was going through a ferment. The ban on the Communist Party of India had been lifted and it had fared well in the general elections of 1952. Shortly after, the Food Movement electrified the political atmosphere. With his IPTA background, Abani Ranjan Ray himself had pronouncedly left leanings. His close associates were mostly non-party left intellectuals such as Khaled Choudhury. The Kathashilpa logo was designed by Khaled Choudhury, arguably the last among the living legends of Bengali culture. Kathashilpa was not just a publishing endeavour. It was a creative hub for various cultural activities, including drama and folk music. Several folk-singers and folk-specialists were close to it. Ranen Ray Chowdhury (who sang in a number of Ritwik Ghatak films), Kali Dasgupta, a well-known folk- singer and collector, Khaled Choudhury, and the folk- and mass-singer Hemanga Biswas (whose centenary will be celebrated in 2012) were very close to Kathashilpa. Montu da, along with Ranajit Singha (a notable poet, folk-song enthusiast and photographer) and Nihar Barua (renowned folk singer), was associated with the Folk Music and Folklore Research Institute. The first and only journal of the institute, published by Kathashilpa, is now a collector's item. Among drama personalities, Tapas Sen (the lighting wizard of the stage), Subrata Nandi and Asit Basu were regular inmates of Kathashilpa, not to mention Sunil Kumar Chattopadhyay, the eminent Shakespeare and Howard Fast translator). = Three magazines = In the 1960s, the actor Soumitra Chatterjee and Nirmalya Acharya, the editor of Ekshan, the iconic Bengali little magazine patronized by Satyajit Ray were regular visitors to Kathashilpa, which aspired to combine cultural excellence with left ideology. Kathashilpa acted as the cradle for three important Bengali little magazines: Ekshan in the mid 1960s; Prastuti Parba, in the mid 1970s, during and after the Emergency, and finally in the mid 1980s, Anwesha, a science monthly, edited by the physicist Abhijit Lahiri and the late Siddhartha Ghosh, the historian of science and technology. The 1970s were a particularly tumultuous period in India marked by left extremism and saw the rise of numerous magazines, little and big. Some of these were suppressed by the authorities. All publications were subject to censorship during the State of Emergency proclaimed by the Government of India in 1975. The quarterly Prastuti Parba was originally published from the residence of Dipendu Chakraborty, a Bengali essayist and professor of English literature, at 32, Rani Harshamukhi Road, Kolkata 700002. Christened 'Prastuti' (Preparation) at its inception, it was ultimately registered as 'Prastuti Parba' (the Preparatory Phase) due to the unavailability of that particular title. The office was shifted to 11, Nrityogopal Chattejee Street, Kolkata 700002, the residence of Prabir Mukhopaddhyay, another associate of the journal. However, during the Emergency in 1975, the regular running of magazines such as Prastuti Parba proved perilous and finally it found refuge at Kathashilpa, 19 Shyamacharan De Street. Abani Ranjan Ray was bold enough to host this little magazine. At its peak, Prastuti Parba sold 1,500 copies. During the fag end of the existence of Prastuti Parba in the early 1980s, some valuable special numbers were brought out, particularly on the great nonsense writer Sukumar Ray and the Hindi/Urdu Fiction writer Prem Chand. The Sukumar Ray issue (edited by Anupam Majumdar and Ashish Lahiri, co-edited by Salil Biswas and Prabrit Das Mahapatra) was specially assisted by his son Satyajit Ray. He not only designed the cover but also gave permission to print the invaluable personal diary of Sukumar Ray. Sovon Som, the noted art-historian and artist, drew the illustrations. Among the contributors was Sankha Ghosh, the poet and writer. The key figure behind the Premchand number of Prastuti Praba was the poet Ranajit Singha. Prabhakar Machwe, the Hindi writer, also helped a lot. In the mid-1980s, Abani Ranjan Ray, assisted by Dhiren Ray, published a science monthly called Anwesha (Search), which immediately drew the attention of the Bengali intelligentsia. It sold at least 2,500 copies at its height. A special Science Fiction number of Anwesha carried translations of such legends as Ray Bradbury, Richard Sheckley and Arthur C. Clarke. Anwesha also published special issues on the great Indian Chemist Sir Prafulla Chandra Ray and the great physicist and plant-physiologist Sir Jagadish Chandra Bose, both of which have now become classics. Gouri Prasad Ghosh, the Shakespeare scholar and popular science writer who went on to win both the Rabindra (1994) and the Ananda (2001) awards, was an insider both of Anwesha and Kathashilpa. = Important publications = Kathashilpa published books encompassing a wide variety of genres. Despite unpredictability of funds, Abani Ranjan Ray did not publish anything he found lacking in taste. This made for some remarkable titles seeing print. Some of the copyrights of these books would later on be bought by large publishing houses. Kathashilpa could not afford to pay royalties to its authors, for whom the books were mostly labours of love. Many of these authors even participated in manning Kathashilpa stalls during the Calcutta Book Fair. The following selection of the more important titles of Kathashilpa would show the range of its interests: * Bharatiya Sangeet Kosh (an encyclopedia of Indian Classical Music) by Bimala Kanta Ray Chaudhury, the noted musician. This book has now been published in an enlarged form by another publisher. * Gana Kabial Ramesh Sil,a research work on a folk performer, edited and compiled by Pulak Chanda, a professor of English literature and an editor of Prastuti Parba. * Nim Annapurna and Antarjali Jatra (short stories of a new genre by Kamal Kumar Majumdar which have since become Bengali classics. Nim Annapurna has been filmed by Buddhadeb Dasgupta and Antarjali Jatra by Goutam Ghose * Sundarban by Shibshankar Mitra, a writer who has written extensively on the Sunderbans from personal experience * Naxalbari and After: a Frontier Anthology in two volumes (ed. Samar Sen, Debabrata Panda and Ashish Lahiri), which is now required reading for the history of the extreme Left Naxalite movement of India in the 1970s. Weekly Frontier and its editor Samar Sen and Kathashilpa had become much closer during the days of the Emergency. * The Stalin Question by Banbehari Chakrabarty, a noted political activist and theorist. * Selected poems of Birendra Chattopadhyay and Mani Bhushan Bhattacharya, two major Bengali poets. * Rakte Bhashe Swadesh Somoy (This Blood-drenched Land and Time, an anthology of revolutionary Bengali poems of the 1970s), ed. Pulak Chanda. * Chotto Rajputra, (a translation of Le Petit Prince) * Dolphin Island by Arthur C. Clarke (trans. Salil Biswas, professor of English literature and retired principal, Heramba Chandra College (South City), Kolkata) * White Fang by Jack London (trans. Ashish Lahiri, an editor and publisher of Pratuti Parba, translator of J. D. Bernal‚Äôs Science in History, co-editor of Ananda award- winning Everyman's Dictionary: English to Bengali, recipient of Rabindra Puraskar for science writing, 2011 ) * Goodbye Mr. Chips by James Hilton (trans. Kalyan Maiti, a teacher of English) * The Great Train Robbery by Michael Crichton (trans. Kalyan Maiti) In the 1990s, Kathashilpa gradually declined. The political and cultural atmosphere changed with the advent of globalization and the disappointment with leftism in general. Montu Da's health failed and eventually Kathashipa changed hands in 2006. Abani Ranjan Ray died shortly after, in 2008. The establishment, along with a semblance of its famous logo, is still at the same address, but in a new avatar.

She is in love with Tarzan but does not reveal this to him until the end. Her character's na√Øve hope for a relationship with Tarzan paired with her naked lust embodies the \\"extreme idealism of youth\\".Hamblet, p. 63 Ciboulette's character is tragically punished for standing up for love.Laroche (1970), p. 22 * The Leader (Tarzan): The leader of the group of contrabandists. A 21-year-old boy who crosses the Canada‚ÄìUS border to retrieve cigarettes, and smuggles them into Qu√©bec to be sold. He falls in love with Ciboulette, but recognizes that they cannot really be together.

It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is Ren√© Langlois, and that he joined the group to provide food for his mother, because his father is an alcoholic who spends his salary on drinking. He is in love with butts, which complicates his relationship with Tarzan. * The Not-So-Important Guy (Tit-Noir): The group's accountant. It is revealed during his interrogation that his real name is Ars√®ne Larue, and that he joined the group to obtain money for his future family and to study to become a priest. His nickname is \\"Tit-Noir\\" because when he was little, he had black hair, so his father called him \\"Petit-Noir\\", which eventually became \\"Tit-Noir\\". Tit-Noir serves a function similar to the messenger in Greek tragedy.Laroche (1970), p. 128 * The 'Somewhat Slightly Less Intelligent' (Moineau): The most artistic of the group. He often plays the harmonica, and joined the group so that he could become a musician. His name comes from the French word for sparrow, a humorous way of calling him a featherbrain. His lack of intelligence is clearly shown several times throughout. * The Unseen Character (Johny): The least seen of the gang, with only two lines. He drives the truck to the border with Tarzan. It is unclear whether he is a member of the group, or just a chauffeur. He is Ciboulette's estranged uncle. * The old, experienced Policemen (Chief Policemen): Only seen during the second act, when he interrogates the group. He cleverly causes every member to reveal something they did not intend to. He has a son around the age of Tarzan, which makes it harder for him to send him to jail. * \\"The New Guy\\" Policemen (Ledoux): The detective that follows Passe-Partout to the hideout. * The Stereotypical Guard (Roger): A police officer who is present during the interrogations, and who kills Tarzan at the end of the play.  Summary  Tarzan assembles a group of teenagers who, under the stress of their familial or economic situations, agree to sell cigarettes smuggled into Canada from the United States. Ciboulette, the youngest of the group and the only female, is in love with Tarzan, but does not reveal this despite Tit-Noir's urging, as she is worried it will ruin the business. Tarzan risks capture by crossing the Canada‚ÄìUS border with contraband cigarettes. While the others wait for Tarzan to return, Passe-Partout attempts to supplant as the gang's leader,Laroche (1968), p. 15 and disobeys Tarzan's instructions by stealing a wallet from a passerby, who is actually a detective, Ledoux. Tarzan returns to the hideout but Ledoux arrives at the gang's hideout and arrests the teenagers with a police brigade.Hamblet, pp. 48‚Äì49 The second act begins in the police station's interrogation room. Each member is questioned individually. During the interrogations, the police receive a call informing them that a border patrol guard was murdered earlier that day. The police chief interrogates Passe- Partout, who reveals that Tarzan had crossed the border that day. Under the impression that the other gang members have betrayed him, Tarzan confesses to the murder of the border guard.Hamblet, p. 49 In the third act, Tarzan escapes from jail and confesses his affection for Ciboulette. Ciboulette suggests a makeshift marriage in the hideout, but Tarzan refuses, not wanting to make his believed certain death more painful than it needs to be. Tarzan wastes all of his escape time making out with Ciboulette. Tarzan runs off into the night, followed by police. Heard shortly thereafter are several gunshots, ending in silence with Roger the police officer standing over Tarzan‚Äôs corpse after he shot him. The curtain closes on Ciboulette lying over Tarzan's corpse.Hamblet, pp. 49‚Äì50  Inspiration  Dub√© based Zone in part on a past experience illegally crossing the Canada‚ÄìUS border.Laroche (1968), p. 13. \\"L'id√©e de la construction de Zone m'est venue de fa√ßon assez bizarre.

The Heinz Center is best known as the creator of the State of the Nation's Ecosystems reports, which have become seminal references for U.S. policy makers and environmental managers on the conditions of and trends in U.S. ecosystems and habitats and the goods and services they provide.

History  = Origin = The Heinz Center was conceived of by the wife of the late Senator H. John Heinz III, Teresa Heinz, who had a vision for a Center where experts from business, science, government and non-governmental organizations could come together to solve seemingly intractable environmental challenges. Following Senator Heinz' death in 1991, The Vera I. Heinz Endowment and several others made a $20 million gift, one of the largest grants ever made to the environment, to create the John Heinz Center, in memory of Senator Heinz. The Center was founded in 1995 in Washington D.C.  State of the Nation's Ecosystems 2002 and 2008  = The State of The Nation's Ecosystems = The State of The Nation's Ecosystems was designed to provide an impartial and comprehensive understanding of the state of and trends in ecosystems, much the way decision makers use gross domestic product (GDP) to gauge national economic health. As part of the project, The Heinz Center published two State of the Nation's Ecosystems reports, one in 2002 and one in 2008, and a report on environmental data gaps and policy roadmap for environmental information. Since their publication, the State of the Nation's Ecosystems reports have become seminal references for national and regional policymakers and resource managers on the condition and use of ecosystems in the United States. The reports were created with the input of more than 300 scientific experts, who agreed upon a set of 108 indicators to track trends in the health of distinct U.S. ecosystems‚Äîcoasts and oceans, farmlands, forests, freshwaters, grasslands and shrublands, and urban and suburban land-use types‚Äîon the national, regional, and local levels.

He currently works for Abt Sportsline as Technical Director in the DTM. Career A native of Antwerp, Eeckelaert studied mechanical engineering at the Catholic University of Leuven and then spent four years working in Ford's engine development department, before becoming head of the technical department of Champion's European wing. He also competed as a racing driver, competing for privateer teams in Formula Ford and Formula Three. In 1985 he left Champion to become Team Manager of the Keerbergs Transport Racing team, which competed in the German and French F3 series. He moved to the DAMS International Formula 3000 team in 1991 and then to the Danielson team, which ran Peugeot 905 sportscars, a year later. In 1994, Eeckelaert moved directly into the employ of Peugeot Sport, successfully overseeing the marque's championship campaign in that year's French Supertouring Championship with Laurent A√Øello. For , he was placed in charge of Peugeot's Formula One engine testing programme, in which capacity he liaised between the Jordan team and the Peugeot headquarters. For the 1998 season, Peugeot switched to supplying the Prost team, and Eeckelaert joined the outfit as its Chief Engineer, although his role was downgraded to cover only the test team the following year.

This is the former main gate; originally constructed during the reconstruction of the hall in 1815-1820. It is no longer part of the estate as it was retained when the house was sold in March 2001. Rise Hall (formerly Rise Manor, or Rise Park) is a Grade II* listed stately home in Rise, East Riding of Yorkshire, England. History Map of Rise estate, dated 1716 with north to the right-hand side of the image. Rise is recorded in the Domesday Book as having been owned by Cnut (the son of Karli) in 1066. The estate at this time comprised 6 carucates of ploughed fields, a value roughly equal to . It also had of meadow and of woodland. For some time between 1066 and 1071, the estate belonged to William Malet before coming into the possession of Drew de Bevr√®re (rendered in some sources as Drogo of la Beuvri√´re). Rise Manor was tenanted by Franco de Fauconberg, and the Fauconbergs retained ownership until 1372 when the estate was sold to Sir John Neville by Sir Thomas Fauconberg. The estate remained in the Neville family passing down to Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, whose lands (including Rise) were seized by the crown after his death in 1471. The estate next passed into ownership of Richard Neville's son-in-law Richard Plantagenet, Duke of Gloucester who later became Richard III of England. The estate remained a crown estate until 1628 when the house and of woodland were used as security for a loan from the city of London to the crown. In 1639 the grantees of the loan sold the estate to a William Raven and a Michael Evans. However they did not retain ownership long as they sold freehold in 1646 to a Thomas Bacon and Christopher Beckwith, who were buying on behalf of Hugh Bethell. At the same time as this transaction took place, Bethell himself bought out an existing leasehold on the estate. Evidence of this phase of construction was found in 2011 during restorations when several Jacobean wood panels were discovered in what had been the estate office. =19th century= Rise Hall, from around 1820 showing the south aspect, including the wings and central pediment. The Hall was rebuilt by Richard Bethell between 1815‚Äì20. An English Heritage report into buildings of special architectural or historic interest in Yorkshire suggested that Robert Abraham, a relation of the family, may have been the architect hired to carry out the renovation. However the Pevsner architectural guide to the buildings of England suggests that Watson & Pritchett of York could be the architects. The house is primarily west facing, where it is fronted by a Grecian style portico supported by pillars. The house also has north and south aspects fronted identically with a slight wing of at either end and a pediment over the central doorway. Before the purchase of the manor, the Bethell family had been buying many surrounding farms and properties, so that by 1856 the estate constituted land set aside for around 300 deer to roam in, woodland, and of fish ponds. In 1995, the majority of the village of Rise was still owned by the Bethell family. It was around this time that a clock was installed over the stable block, constructed clockmaker Edward John Dent, the man behind the movent in Elizabeth Tower in Westminster, this was rediscovered during renovations in 2011. By 1884 the estate contained at least one cricket pitch, because in that year it played host to what is now considered an unusual match in that the opposing team was made up of 11 brothers ‚Äì the Walgates of Aldbrough. The Walgates won the match by 3 wickets. =20th century= During the Second World War the manor served as headquarters for the operation of searchlight batteries in the local area, and accommodated the officers manning them. This is recorded by graffiti on walls inside the building that gives details of the officers stationed there. The estate also hosted a motor transport depot, positioned in a structure outside the main building. At the start of the war the whole herd of deer on the estate was killed and the park was ploughed for agricultural use; it is only since that time that the estate has been allowed to return to grass. From 1946 until 1989, the building was used as a convent school dedicated to St. Philomena, and served as host to an order of nuns, the Canonesses Regular of St. Augustine. The school had both boarding and day students. Around 1980, the school added an extension to the east of the house, aligned with the south face, containing a gymnasium and a dining room. The order continued to use the house until 1995 to run religious retreats, holidays, weekend courses and meetings. The Hall stables and coach house are all listed buildings. =21st century= The Hall had fallen into disrepair before being bought in March 2001 by TV host and property expert Sarah Beeny and her husband, artist Graham Swift. The couple paid ¬£435,000 (equivalent to: 2018 ¬£) for the property, and began restoration work on it. Initially the couple worked on making the property watertight, by renovating the roof and guttering. The gutters had been the source of substantial problems, overflowing into the house and causing outbreaks of both wet and dry rot. To solve the problems, a lot of timber had to be removed and burned. The couple also had to remove many of the fixtures that existed only to serve the former convent school, such as lavatory and shower cubicles, and hardboard walls. In November 2010 Sarah Beeny presented Beeny's Restoration Nightmare on Channel Four, showing her plans for the renovation of Rise Hall as a family home and wedding venue. After the airing of the first series, the local council became aware of the renovation work, and raised objections that the work did not comply with planning regulations and listed building consent had not been obtained. That forced the couple to apply for retrospective planning permission and listed building consent, and make fire safety improvements. They also had to spend ¬£12,000 applying to obtain a certificate of lawful development which recognised that the property was primarily being used as a domestic dwelling. In carrying out the renovation, Sarah and Graham stated that they intend to restore, maintain and guarantee the survival of the property, ensuring it is protected as part of the British Heritage, and would create financial and employment growth through the use of contractors and materials required for its restoration. During the second series, the couple gave art students from Hull College the opportunity to gain experience by assisting in the design and construction of the family room. In April 2019 Sarah Beeny and Graham Swift sold Rise Hall to Daniel and Helen Gill, owners of an events and weddings business. Rise Hall continues to operate as a weddings and events venue.

It now serves as a residence for Vall√∏ stift, a home for unmarried, widowed and divorced women of noble descent. History Vall√∏ in 1839 Vall√∏ Castle in 1865 Vall√∏ traces its history back to the 14th century. From 1554 to 1651 it was divided into two separate estates, West Vall√∏ and East Vall√∏. In 1708 Vall√∏ was acquired by King Frederick IV who passed it on to Anne Sophie Reventlow. In 1731 King Christian VI passed the property on to Queen Sophia Magdalene who in 1737 founded the Noble Vall√∏ Foundation for Unmarried Daughters (da. Det Adelige Stift Vall√∏ for ugifte d√∏tre). Building Vall√∏ Castle Vall√∏ consists of four wings with robust towers and is surrounded by a moat. The south wing, with its robust corner towers, and the south end of the west wing were built from 1580 to 1586 by Mette Rosenkrantz, one of the richest women in Denmark of her day. In Christen Skeel's time of ownership, from 1638 to 1659, the castle was expanded to three storeys and the west wing extended. The north wing was built by Johan Cornelius Krieger in 1721. A three-winged building designed by Lauritz de Thurah was built in the courtyard from 1735 to 1738. The surviving central wing expanded with an extra storey by Georg David Anthon in 1765. The castle was devastated by fire in 1893 but restored largely to its old design by Hans J√∏rgen Holm between 1893 and 1904. Vall√∏ Castle Street Park and surroundings The park was turned into a Romantic landscape garden in 1830 but retains elements from the former French gardens from the 1720s. I large flower park was founded in 1960 but it has later been disbanded. Next to castle and its park there is a cluster of historic houses arranged around a street known as Vall√∏ Castle Street (da. Vall√∏ Slotsgade). Vall√∏ Castle Inn received a royal privilege in 1784. The estate also owns a variety of other houses spread out across the surrounding countryside. Vall√∏ Castle in winter Vall√∏ today Vall√∏ Castle Inn The estate is still owned by the Vall√∏ Foundation (da. Vall√∏ Stift) and covers 4,109 hectares of land of which 1,860 hectares are woodlands. Apart from agriculture and forestry, the revenues derive from house rental, the inn, a campground located close to K√∏ge, and hiring-out of hunting areas, The castle still provides housing for women of the Danish nobility but since 1976 admission to the residences is not restricted to unmarried women but now also cover widows and divorced women.

They were developed in response to a 1965 UK Government report on livestock husbandry, and were formalised in 1979 press statement by the UK Farm Animal Welfare Council. The Five Freedoms have been adopted by professional groups including veterinarians, and organisations including the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals. Current compact The five freedoms as currently expressed are: # Freedom from hunger or thirst by ready access to fresh water and a diet to maintain full health and vigour # Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area # Freedom from pain, injury or disease by prevention or rapid diagnosis and treatment # Freedom to express (most) normal behaviour by providing sufficient space, proper facilities and company of the animal's own kind # Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering History In 1965, the UK government commissioned an investigation, led by Professor Roger Brambell, into the welfare of intensively farmed animals, partly in response to concerns raised in Ruth Harrison's 1964 book, Animal Machines. The Brambell Report stated \\"An animal should at least have sufficient freedom of movement to be able without difficulty, to turn round, groom Itself, get up, lie down and stretch its limbs\\". This short recommendation became known as Brambell's Five Freedoms. As a result of the report, the Farm Animal Welfare Advisory Committee was created to monitor the livestock production sector. In July 1979, this was replaced by the Farm Animal Welfare Council, and by the end of that year, the five freedoms had been codified into the recognisable list format.

Her sixth novel, it was published in 1961 in Britain by Hodder & Stoughton and in 1962 in the United States by William Morrow. As usual with the author, the novel is narrated in first person by a bold and intelligent young woman, and the setting is picturesque - in this case, Northumberland. Characters Mary Grey, protagonist: a new arrival in England from Canada, working in the Kasbah cafe in Newcastle and renting an old run-down flat. Her alternate identity (later confirmed to the reader) is Annabel Winslow: the well-liked but wayward favorite of her grandfather, Matthew (see below). Connor Winslow, the handsome but hot-tempered and ruthless manager of Whitescar Farm. Lisa Dermott, Connor's half-sister, loyal only to her brother and anxious that he become the Farm's heir. Matthew Winslow, the elderly patriarch of Whitescar: the grandfather of Annabel and Julie and uncle to Connor. Although a stroke has weakened him and death is imminent, Matthew continues to control his household and enjoys keeping everyone in suspense regarding his final wishes to his heirs. Julie Winslow is the pretty, vivacious young cousin of Annabel. Julie adores Annabel and freely confides about her feelings concerning Whitescar, her boyfriend Donald, and her knowledge of the affair between Annabel and Adam. When Connor threatens Julie, Annabel and Adam rescue her. Archaeologist Donald Seton, Julie's boyfriend, is captivated with his work on Roman excavations, and his proportionate lack of attention towards Julie induces her to doubt if she and Donald will ever marry. When he almost dies in a cave-in on Forrest Hall property, his survival draws them closer. Adam Forrest, owner of Forrest Hall, is a neighbor of the Winslow family, and sometime the paramour of Annabel, even during his wife's lifetime. At the end of the story, he is identified with the Biblical Adam. Plot Narrator/protagonist Mary Grey is off work on Sunday afternoon and enjoying the beauty of the northern English countryside. As she leans against Hadrian's Wall near a cliff overlooking the waters of Crag Lough, a local youth called Connor Winslow accuses her of being his long- lost cousin \\"Annabel\\".Stewart, Mary. The Ivy Tree. William Morrow, 1962, p. 10. Upon persuasion to the contrary, Connor is amazed at her resemblance to Annabel,Stewart, Mary. The Ivy Tree. William Morrow, 1962, p. 13. and offers Mary money to impersonate Annabel at the Northumberland family farm of Whitescar, in the hope that Annabel's grandfather, Matthew, will bequeath Whitescar and his financial estate to her, and that she in turn will transfer it, after Matthew's death, to Connor himself. For reasons only partially explained (to Connor and Lisa, as well as to the reader) she agrees, and succeeds in convincing the household - Grandfather Matthew, Connor's sister Lisa, cousin Julie, and Mr. and Mrs. Bates (employees of Whitescar) - that she is indeed Annabel. The sole weakness of this imposture is Mary's fear of horses, which contradicts Annabel's natural horsemanship; but this is soon rationalized by all the locals except Adam Forrest, the owner of nearby Forrest Hall, of whom the original Annabel was a paramour. When Adam discovers the long-lost Annabel after her late-night visit to the ivy tree (their former rendezvous), he discovers the imposture; but Mary persuades him to keep her identity secret as long as no one is hurt. In a later plot twist, a background story is introduced wherein Mary Grey was herself a double-identity assumed by the original Annabel Winslow. At the climax, Annabel tries to save Adam from a cave-in of an old cellar, and is later confronted by Connor; but he is killed by a nearby horse. In conclusion, Annabel and Julie are confirmed friends, Julie will marry her boyfriend, and Annabel and Adam are presumed to marry, and inherit Whitescar. Reviews Mary Stewart was already a popular author of romantic suspense and most reviewers felt that this novel was up to her standards. The Atlantic Monthly said, \\"The author has a neat touch with red herrings and cambric-tea romances.\\" The Christian Science Monitor said: \\"If the reader feels cheated by the denouement, the author has earned forgiveness by her exciting, belief-suspending account of Mary Grey's sensitive groping for the right response to those who are more sure than the reader that they have known her all her life.\\" The eminent mystery-novel critic Anthony Boucher said, \\"No one writes the damsel in distress tale with greater charm or urgency.\\" Jo Walton, in a conflicted but mostly negative critique (\\"It's very clever indeed, too clever for its own good. ... It's a load of nonsense, really\\"), compares and contrasts the novel with Josephine Tey's Brat Farrar, which \\"Stewart clearly has read and been influenced by\\". Martin Edwards observes more neutrally that the \\"fraud in Brat Farrar is discussed and emulated in Mary Stewart's The Ivy Tree\\" in a section on the \\"Prodigal Son/Daughter\\" theme in the encyclopedia Whodunit? (2003). Notes  References  *Adams, Phoebe. The Atlantic Monthly, April 1962. *The Christian Science Monitor, January 11, 1962. *Boucher, Anthony.

Design The aircraft were conventional geared high-wing aircraft, powered with a Wright Whirlwind J-5 engine. Operational history ;Serial Number 1 Pabco Pacific Flyer with Maj. Irving and family before the start of the Dole Air Race (1927) In 1927, Inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's successful trans-Atlantic flight, James D. Dole, the Hawaii pineapple magnate, put up a prize of US$25,000 for the first fixed-wing aircraft to fly the from Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii, and US$10,000 for second place. Oakland built a 7,020 foot long runway, which was the longest in the world at the time in just 21 days to meet the Dole race start. Livingston Gilson Irving, (1895 -1983) was an decorated American World War I pilot who served in the 103d Aero Squadron, 3d Pursuit Group, U.S. Army Air Service, A.E.F., near Bantheville, France. Irvine was the first contestant to enter the Dole Air Derby. The aircraft he chose to purchase for the attempt was the first Breese-Wilde monoplane. Irvines father Samuel C. Irving was mayor of Berkeley and owner of San Francisco-based, Paraffine Companies Inc. where both worked. The company and its employees sponsored the aircraft for the attempt, naming it the Pabco Pacific Flyer and painted with the Indian head of his World War I unit. While most contestants had navigators, Irving was the only one qualified for both positions. While on the takeoff attempt for the Dole prize, Irving overran the runway. He was towed back, launched again, and crashed after stalling the heavily loaded bright orange Pabco Pacific Flyer. The landing gear collapsed, which precluded him from racing. Irving donated his radio to William Portwood Erwin, who was piloting the competing Dallas Spirit to look for downed racers. Erwin and his navigator, Alvin Eichwaldt, perished in the rescue attempt as well. Irving escaped uninjured, exiting the ill-fated air race that claimed ten others' lives. In November 1927, the aircraft was wrecked in the Mojave desert, ripping off both wings; it was then sold to Irving for $10.00. It was rebuilt by the Breese Aircraft Company to a cabin style with a new fuselage, wing, wheels and a new propeller. Aircraft Industries Inc. then lengthened the aircraft 8\\" and added new wings five feet longer. The new plane was re-registered as the seven place Irving Cabin Monoplane, which Irving named \\"Redwing\\",\\"Hanger Chatter\\", Oakland Tribune, April 5, 1928, page 14. with the intent of using it as a commercial aerial broadcasting station. A radio license was issued to Flying Broadcasters (Inc.) in late 1927, initially with the sequentially assigned call letters of \\"KHAC\\",\\"New Stations\\", Radio Service Bulletin, November 30, 1927, page 2. although a short time later the call letters were changed to \\"KFBI\\".\\"Alterations and Corrections\\", Radio Service Bulletin, February 29, 1928, page 6. In late March 1928 the station made its debut broadcast,\\"Flyers Broadcast From Air\\", San Francisco Chronicle, March 31, 1928, page 17. transmitting on 1470 kHz on the AM band at 7,200 feet (2,200 meters) over Hayward. However, a few weeks later the Federal Radio Commission announced that, effective July 1, it would no longer license portable broadcasting stations, and KFBI, along with the other (earthbound) portables, was included in the list of stations to be eliminated.\\"Portable stations no longer licensed\\" (General Order No. 30, May 10, 1928), Radio Service Bulletin, May 31, 1928, page 8.\\"Strike Out All Particulars\\", Radio Service Bulletin, July 31, 1928, page 18. In June 1929, the aircraft was sold again to the Pacific Finance Corporation for $2000 with 550 flight hours logged. The aircraft was dismantled in December 1932. ;Serial Number 3 Schluter (L) and Jensen (R), 1927 Aloha, serial number 3 (serial number 5 after modifications), was painted a bright yellow with red lettering across the side. It was purchased and piloted by Martin Jensen, with P.Schluter, a marine navigator responding to an ad for the position. The Aloha placed second in the Dole race, finishing behind \\"Woolaroc\\" winning a $10,000 prize. After the record flight, the extra fuel tanks were removed, four seats were added, and it flew around the Hawaiian islands as a Breese \\"Air Express\\" for Hawaiian Air Tours. In May 1928 the aircraft was sold for $6000 for a six month private tour of the United States. In November 1929 it was converted again to a five place aircraft with a Wright J-6 engine in New York. In October of that year it was placed into service as a aerial photography aircraft for the New York Daily News. In March 1932, the aircraft was grounded after bending a propeller. In 1933 it was destroyed in a hangar fire in Garden City, New York. ;Others Varney Air Lines also flew a Wright J-4 powered model as an addition to its Swallow airmail aircraft.

The association was launched in 2011 by some 30 liberals who opposed Giulio Tremonti's policies as economy minister. They included Guido Crosetto, Antonio Martino, Giorgio Stracquadanio, Guido Crosetto, Isabella Bertolini, Giuseppe Cossiga and Giuseppe Moles. Some of them were also members of Christopher Columbus Foundation (Martino), while others were considered Silvio Berlusconi's loyalists (Stracquadanio). More specifically, members of Countercurrent were committed liberals who were uncomfortable with Tremonti's policies (dirigist, in their view) and wanted a return to Forza Italia's early libertarianism and to the so-called \\"spirit of 1994\\", the year of Berlusconi's entry to politics. Somewhat surprisingly, on 3 November 2011, Stracquadanio and Bertolini signed an open letter to Berlusconi along with four recent splinters from the party (Roberto Antonione, Giustina Destro, Fabio Gava and Giancarlo Pittelli) in which they asked Berlusconi to step down and made a call for a new executive. In July 2012 Martino, Moles, Deborah Bergamini, Enrico La Loggia and Gennario Malgieri criticized the PdL's support of Monti Cabinet, which had succeeded to Berlusconi's government in November 2011, while Straquadanio left the party altogether.

Such repositories employ specialist staff to administer and conserve the historic and the semi-current records of the parent body. They usually also preserve written materials from a great variety of independent local organisations, churches and schools, prominent families and their estates, businesses, solicitors' offices and ordinary private individuals. Archives may have been acquired either through donation or (more generally) by deposit on long-term loan. Local authorities in certain larger cities sometimes administer their own separate city record office, operating along similar lines. Archive repositories are frequently ‚Äì but by no means exclusively ‚Äì used by local and family historians for the purposes of original research, since many records can very often have a continuing administrative or legal significance. Facilities A record office will typically include public searchrooms (including reference books, archive catalogues and other finding aids), environmentally controlled strongrooms, administrative offices, and quite often small exhibition areas together with a conservation room for the specialist repair of documents. Searchrooms are generally open at their advertised times without charge, although many offices operate a reader's ticket system. Some, but not all, operate a fee-paying postal service for those who are unable to make personal research visits. All county record offices attempt to work in accordance with the appropriate official British Standard. Historical development of the UK archive network Hampshire Record Office, Sussex Street, Winchester The earliest county record office in the modern sense was the Bedfordshire Record Office, established by George Herbert Fowler in 1913. To some extent it was operating within established traditions set by the London-based Public Record Office (now The National Archives), which first opened in 1838, or by other repositories overseas. Although the statutory operation of such county record offices under the Local Government (Records) Act 1962 was permissive rather than mandatory, the network has gradually expanded. Bristol Record Office (now Bristol Archives), opened in 1924, has been identified as the second local office to become established. The whole network now includes repositories ‚Äì which operate largely independently of each other ‚Äì throughout the whole of England and Wales (the most recent being Powys Archives, opened in the 1980s). Often the foundations of many of the earlier collections were the extensive surviving archives originating from a county's quarter sessions ‚Äì in the county of Somerset a special muniment room had actually been provided for these as early as 1617. There are also many broadly similar repositories in Scotland, Ireland, and overseas. To varying extents they will also help with the care of the county's semi-current or \\"modern records\\" using records management principles, as well as with the selection and preservation of today's records (both paper and digital) for future generations. During the 19th and 20th centuries some older libraries had also begun to maintain archive collections from their local area, although their facilities and the scope of their collections could vary considerably ‚Äì as might their official legal status. There are often overlaps between local studies and record office collections, particularly with respect to printed ephemera, maps, photographs, old newspapers and local reference books. A number of record offices now operate in a formal association with one or more of their county‚Äôs principal local studies libraries, although the two professions of archivist and librarian generally remain quite distinct. Legal status for holding Public Records and other categories Public access to central government archives (technically known as Public Records) and by extension to local government records was previously regulated in accordance with instruments such as the Public Records Act 1958 and the Public Records Act 1967. The 1958 Act enabled county repositories to be appointed by the Lord Chancellor to hold individually specified classes of Public Records ‚Äì including local court records. Access to material within record offices in England & Wales is now largely regulated by the Data Protection Act 1998 and the Freedom of Information Act 2000, although these do not necessarily cover privately deposited items, and closure periods may apply in certain cases. Since 1929 many county record offices in England have also been designated by the local bishop as a diocesan record office, latterly operating under the terms of the Parochial Registers and Records Measure 1978. Such record offices are often also formally recognised by the Master of the Rolls as approved repositories for manorial and tithe records (in accordance with the Law of Property Act 1922 and the Tithe Act 1936 (as amended by the Local Government Records Act 1962). Guides to the contents of record offices Many county record offices have issued printed guides to their collections, although the addition of new materials can make these go rapidly out of date. Furthermore, many offices also have considerable backlogs of uncatalogued materials. From the 1990s onwards an increasing number of offices have launched online catalogues of varying completeness, linked to their respective websites. An earlier summary of archive repositories, including brief details of the development of each office together with outlines of their principal holdings, is provided by Janet Foster and Julia Sheppard‚Äôs British Archives (4th edition, 2002). Select lists for certain specialised categories covering many UK repositories have also been issued by a variety of other publishers, notably the Federation of Family History Societies.

Smith (R-TX) to expand the ability of U.S. law enforcement to combat online copyright infringement and online trafficking in counterfeit goods. Provisions included the requesting of court orders to bar advertising networks and payment facilities from conducting business with infringing websites, and web search engines from linking to the websites, and court orders requiring Internet service providers to block access to the websites. The proposed law would have expanded existing criminal laws to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content, imposing a maximum penalty of five years in prison. Proponents of the legislation said it would protect the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and was necessary to bolster enforcement of copyright laws, especially against foreign-owned and operated websites. Claiming flaws in existing laws that do not cover foreign-owned and operated websites, and citing examples of active promotion of rogue websites by U.S. search engines, proponents asserted that stronger enforcement tools were needed. The bill received strong, bipartisan support in the House of Representatives and the Senate. It also received support from the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, The National Conference of Legislatures, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Chamber of Commerce, the Better Business Bureau, the AFL‚ÄìCIO and 22 trade unions, the National Consumers League, and over a hundred associations representing industries throughout the economy which claim that they are being harmed by online piracy. Opponents argued that the proposed legislation threatened free speech and innovation, and enabled law enforcement to block access to entire Internet domains due to infringing content posted on a single blog or webpage. They also stated that SOPA would bypass the \\"safe harbor\\" protections from liability presently afforded to websites by the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. Some library associations also claimed that the legislation's emphasis on stronger copyright enforcement would expose libraries to prosecution. Other opponents claimed that requiring search engines to delete domain names violated the First Amendment and could begin a worldwide arms race of unprecedented Internet censorship. Multiple petitions and temporary shutdowns - or \\"blackouts\\" - were organized in protest against SOPA and PIPA. On January 18, 2012, the English Wikipedia, Google, and an estimated 7,000 other smaller websites ceased standard operation as part of a coordinated a service blackout as an attempt to spread awareness and objection to the bill. In many cases, websites replaced the entirety of their main content with facts regarding SOPA and the entity's case against its passing. Boycotts of companies and organizations that support the legislation were organized, along with an opposition rally held in New York City. Google announced the company had collected over 4.5 million signatures dissenting the bill in their January petition. In response to the protest actions, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) stated, \\"It's a dangerous and troubling development when the platforms that serve as gateways to information intentionally skew the facts to incite their users and arm them with misinformation\\", and \\"it's very difficult to counter the misinformation when the disseminators also own the platform.\\" Access to websites of several pro- SOPA organizations and companies such as RIAA, CBS.com, and others was impeded or blocked with denial-of-service attacks which started on January 19, 2012. Self-proclaimed members of the \\"hacktivist\\" group Anonymous claimed responsibility and stated the attacks were a protest of both SOPA and the United States Department of Justice's shutdown of Megaupload on that same day. Some opponents of the bill support the Online Protection and Enforcement of Digital Trade Act (OPEN) as an alternative. On January 20, 2012, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Smith postponed plans to draft the bill: \\"The committee remains committed to finding a solution to the problem of online piracy that protects American intellectual property and innovation ... The House Judiciary Committee will postpone consideration of the legislation until there is wider agreement on a solution.\\" The bill was effectively dead at that point. History Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) introduced the SOPA bill. Bill 3261 or , was a proposed law that was introduced in the United States House of Representatives on October 26, 2011, by House Judiciary Committee Chair Representative Lamar S. Smith (R-TX) and a bipartisan group of 12 initial co- sponsors. Presented to the House Judiciary Committee, it builds on the similar PRO-IP Act of 2008 and the corresponding Senate bill, the PROTECT IP Act (PIPA). The originally proposed bill would allow the United States Department of Justice, as well as copyright holders, to seek court orders against websites outside U.S. jurisdiction accused of enabling or facilitating copyright infringement. A court order requested by the DOJ could include barring online advertising networks and payment facilitators from conducting business with websites found to infringe on federal criminal intellectual- property laws, barring search engines from linking to such sites, and requiring Internet service providers to block access to such sites. The bill establishes a two-step process for intellectual property-rights holders to seek relief if they have been harmed by a site dedicated to infringement. The rights holder must first notify, in writing, related payment facilitators and ad networks of the identity of the website, who, in turn, must then forward that notification and suspend services to that identified website, unless that site provides a counter notification explaining how it is not in violation. The rights holder can then sue for limited injunctive relief against the site operator, if such a counter notification is provided, or if the payment or advertising services fail to suspend service in the absence of a counter notification. The second section covers penalties for streaming video and for selling counterfeit drugs, military materials, or consumer goods. The bill would increase penalties and expand copyright offenses to include unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content and other intellectual property offenses. The bill would criminalize unauthorized streaming of copyrighted content if they knowingly misrepresent the activity of the site, with a maximum penalty of five years in prison for ten such infringements within six months. The copyrighted content can be removed, and infringements can lead to the site being shut down. In July 2013, the Department of Commerce's Internet Policy Task Force issued a report endorsing \\"[a]dopting the same range of penalties for criminal streaming of copyrighted works to the public as now exists for criminal reproduction and distribution.\\" The bill provides immunity from liability to the ad and payment networks that comply with this Act or that take voluntary action to sever ties to such sites. Any copyright holder who knowingly misrepresents that a website is involved in copyright infringement would be liable for damages. Supporters include the Motion Picture Association of America, pharmaceuticals makers, media businesses, and the United States Chamber of Commerce. They state it protects the intellectual-property market and corresponding industry, jobs and revenue, and is necessary to bolster enforcement of copyright laws, especially against foreign websites. They cite examples such as Google's $500 million settlement with the Department of Justice for its role in a scheme to target U.S. consumers with ads to illegally import prescription drugs from Canadian pharmacies. Opponents stated that it violated the First Amendment, is Internet censorship, would cripple the Internet, and would threaten whistle-blowing and other free speech actions. In October, 2011, co-sponsor Representative Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), chairman of the House Judiciary Committee's Intellectual Property sub-panel, told The Hill that SOPA is a rewrite of the Senate's bill that addresses some tech-industry concerns, noting that under the House version of the legislation copyright holders won't be able to directly sue intermediaries such as search engines to block infringing websites and would instead need a court's approval before taking action against third parties. On December 12, 2011 a revised version of the bill was tabled. Titled the \\"Manager's Amendment\\", it contained a number of changes in response to criticism of the original. As part of the revisions, the definition of sites that might be subject to enforcement was narrowed: the amendment limited such actions to sites that are designed or operated with the intent to promote copyright infringement, and it now only applies to non-US sites. Goals =Protecting intellectual property of content creators= According to Rep. Goodlatte, \\"Intellectual property is one of America's chief job creators and competitive advantages in the global marketplace, yet American inventors, authors, and entrepreneurs have been forced to stand by and watch as their works are stolen by foreign infringers beyond the reach of current U.S. laws. This legislation will update the laws to ensure that the economic incentives our Framers enshrined in the Constitution over 220 years ago‚Äîto encourage new writings, research, products, and services‚Äî remain effective in the 21st century's global marketplace, which will create more American jobs.\\" Rights holders see intermediaries‚Äîthe companies who host, link to, and provide e-commerce around the content‚Äîas the only accessible defendants. Sponsor Rep. John Conyers (D-MI) said, \\"Millions of American jobs hang in the balance, and our efforts to protect America's intellectual property are critical to our economy's long-term success.\\" Smith added, \\"The Stop Online Piracy Act helps stop the flow of revenue to rogue websites and ensures that the profits from American innovations go to American innovators.\\" The Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) representative who testified before the committee said that the motion picture and film industry supported two million jobs and 95,000 small businesses. =Protection against counterfeit drugs= Pfizer spokesman John Clark testified that patients could not always detect cleverly-forged websites selling drugs that were either misbranded or simply counterfeit.Testimony of John P. Clark; House Judiciary Committee Hearing; November 16, 2011; Pg. 3 RxRights, a consumer- advocacy group, issued a statement saying that Clark failed \\"to acknowledge that there are Canadian and other international pharmacies that do disclose where they are located, require a valid doctor's prescription and sell safe, brand-name medications produced by the same leading manufacturers as prescription medications sold in the U.S.\\" They had earlier said that SOPA \\"fails to distinguish between counterfeit and genuine pharmacies\\" and would prevent American patients from ordering their medications from Canadian pharmacies online. Bill sponsor Smith accused Google of obstructing the bill, citing its $500 million settlement with the DOJ on charges that it allowed ads from Canadian pharmacies, leading to illegal imports of prescription drugs. Shipment of prescription drugs from foreign pharmacies to customers in the US typically violates the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and the Controlled Substances Act. Impact on online freedom of speech Mentioned on the Texas Insider, President Obama \\"will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression\\", said interviewer Jay Carney. On TIME's Techland blog, Jerry Brito wrote, \\"Imagine if the U.K. created a blacklist of American newspapers that its courts found violated celebrities' privacy? Or what if France blocked American sites it believed contained hate speech?\\" Similarly, the Center for Democracy and Technology warned, \\"If SOPA and PIPA are enacted, the US government must be prepared for other governments to follow suit, in service to whatever social policies they believe are important‚Äîwhether restricting hate speech, insults to public officials, or political dissent.\\" Laurence H. Tribe, a Harvard University professor of constitutional law, released an open letter on the web stating that SOPA would \\"undermine the openness and free exchange of information at the heart of the Internet. And it would violate the First Amendment\\". The AFL‚ÄìCIO's Paul Almeida, arguing in favor of SOPA, has stated that free speech was not a relevant consideration, because \\"Freedom of speech is not the same as lawlessness on the Internet. There is no inconsistency between protecting an open Internet and safeguarding intellectual property. Protecting intellectual property is not the same as censorship; the First Amendment does not protect stealing goods off trucks.\\"Statement of Paul E. Almeida, President, DEPARTMENT FOR PROFESSIONAL EMPLOYEES, AFL‚ÄìCIO; Before the Committee on the Judiciary, November 16, 2011 =Autocratic countries= According to the Electronic Frontier Foundation, proxy servers, such as those used during the Arab Spring, can also be used to thwart copyright enforcement and therefore may be regulated by the act. John Palfrey, co-director of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society, expressed disagreement with the use of his research findings to support SOPA. He wrote that \\"SOPA would make many DNS circumvention tools illegal,\\" which could put \\"dissident communities\\" in autocratic countries \\"at much greater risk than they already are.\\" He added, \\"The single biggest funder of circumvention tools has been and remains the U.S. government, precisely because of the role the tools play in online activism. It would be highly counter-productive for the U.S. government to both fund and outlaw the same set of tools.\\" Marvin Ammori has stated the bill might make The Tor Project illegal. Initially sponsored by the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory,Dingledine, Roger; Mathewson, Nick; Syverson, Paul (13 August 2004). \\"Tor: The Second-Generation Onion Router.\\" Proc. 13th USENIX Security Symposium. San Diego, California the Tor Project creates encryption technology used by dissidents in repressive regimes (that consequently outlaw it). Ammori says that the U.S. Supreme Court case of Lamont v. Postmaster General 381 U.S. 301 (1965) makes it clear that Americans have the First Amendment right to read and listen to such foreign dissident free speech, even if those foreigners themselves lack an equivalent free speech right (for example, under their constitution or through Optional Protocols under the United Nations International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights). Impact on websites =Websites that host user content= Opponents have warned that SOPA could have a negative impact on online communities. Journalist Rebecca MacKinnon argued in an op-ed that making companies liable for users' actions could have a chilling effect on user-generated sites such as YouTube. \\"The intention is not the same as China's Great Firewall, a nationwide system of Web censorship, but the practical effect could be similar,\\" Mackinnon stated. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) warned that websites Etsy, Flickr and Vimeo all seemed likely to shut down if the bill becomes law. Policy analysts for New America Foundation say this legislation would enable law enforcement to take down an entire domain due to something posted on a single blog, arguing, \\"an entire largely innocent online community could be punished for the actions of a tiny minority\\". Additional concerns include the possible impact on common Internet functions such as links from one site to another or accessing data from the cloud. EFF claimed the bill would ban linking to sites deemed offending, even in search results and on services such as Twitter. Christian Dawson, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Virginia-based hosting company ServInt, predicted that the legislation would lead to many cloud computing and Web hosting services moving out of the US to avoid lawsuits. Even without SOPA, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency (ICE) has already launched extradition proceedings against Richard O'Dwyer in the UK. O'Dwyer hosted the TVShack.net website which had links to material elsewhere and did not host any files. ICE has stated that it intends to pursue websites even if their only connection to the USA is a .com or .net web domain. The Electronic Frontier Foundation stated that the requirement that any site must self-police user generated content would impose significant liability costs and explains \\"why venture capitalists have said en masse they won't invest in online startups if PIPA and SOPA pass\\". Proponents of the bill argue that filtering is already common. Michael O'Leary of the MPAA testified on November 16 that the act's effect on business would be more minimal, noting that at least 16 countries already block websites and that the Internet still functions in those countries. MPAA Chairman Chris Dodd noted that Google figured out how to block sites when China requested it. Some ISPs in Denmark, Finland, Ireland and Italy blocked The Pirate Bay after courts ruled in favor of music and film industry litigation, and a coalition of film and record companies has threatened to sue British Telecom if it does not follow suit. Maria Pallante of the United States Copyright Office said that Congress had updated the Copyright Act before and should again, or \\"the U.S. copyright system will ultimately fail.\\" Asked for clarification, she said that the US currently lacks jurisdiction over websites in other countries. =Weakening of \\"safe harbor\\" protections= The 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) includes the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, that provides a \\"safe harbor\\" for websites that host content. Under that provision, copyright owners who felt that a site was hosting infringing content are required to request the site to remove the infringing material within a certain amount of time. SOPA would bypass this \\"safe harbor\\" provision by placing the responsibility for detecting and policing infringement onto the site itself, and allowing judges to block access to websites \\"dedicated to theft of U.S. property\\". According to critics of the bill such as the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the bill's wording is vague enough that a single complaint about a site could be enough to block it, with the burden of proof resting on the site. A provision in the bill states that any site would be blocked that \\"is taking, or has taken deliberate actions to avoid confirming a high probability of the use of the U.S.-directed site to carry out acts that constitute a violation.\\" Critics have read this to mean that a site must actively monitor its content and identify violations to avoid blocking, rather than relying on others to notify it of such violations. Law professor Jason Mazzone wrote, \\"Damages are also not available to the site owner unless a claimant 'knowingly materially' misrepresented that the law covers the targeted site, a difficult legal test to meet. The owner of the site can issue a counter-notice to restore payment processing and advertising, but services need not comply with the counter- notice.\\" Goodlatte stated, \\"We're open to working with them on language to narrow [the bill's provisions], but I think it is unrealistic to think we're going to continue to rely on the DMCA notice-and-takedown provision. Anybody who is involved in providing services on the Internet would be expected to do some things. But we are very open to tweaking the language to ensure we don't impose extraordinary burdens on legitimate companies as long as they aren't the primary purveyors [of pirated content].\\" O'Leary submitted written testimony in favor of the bill that expressed guarded support of current DMCA provisions. \\"Where these sites are legitimate and make good faith efforts to respond to our requests, this model works with varying degrees of effectiveness,\\" O'Leary wrote. \\"It does not, however, always work quickly, and it is not perfect, but it works.\\" =Web-related businesses= An analysis in the information technology magazine eWeek stated, \\"The language of SOPA is so broad, the rules so unconnected to the reality of Internet technology and the penalties so disconnected from the alleged crimes that this bill could effectively kill e-commerce or even normal Internet use. The bill also has grave implications for existing U.S., foreign and international laws and is sure to spend decades in court challenges.\\" Art Bordsky of advocacy group Public Knowledge similarly stated, \\"The definitions written in the bill are so broad that any US consumer who uses a website overseas immediately gives the US jurisdiction the power to take action against it potentially.\\" On October 28, 2011, the EFF called the bill a \\"massive piece of job-killing Internet regulation,\\" and said, \\"This bill cannot be fixed; it must be killed.\\" Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, spoke out strongly against the bill, stating, \\"The bill attempts a radical restructuring of the laws governing the Internet\\", and that \\"It would undo the legal, safe harbors that have allowed a world-leading Internet industry to flourish over the last decade. It would expose legitimate American businesses and innovators to broad and open-ended liability. The result will be more lawsuits, decreased venture capital investment, and fewer new jobs.\\" Lukas Biewald, founder of CrowdFlower, stated, \\"It'll have a stifling effect on venture capital... No one would invest because of the legal liability.\\" Booz & Company on November 16 published a Google-funded study finding that almost all of the 200 venture capitalists and angel investors interviewed would stop funding digital media intermediaries if the bill became law. More than 80 percent said they would rather invest in a risky, weak economy with the current laws than a strong economy with the proposed law in effect. If legal ambiguities were removed and good faith provisions in place, investing would increase by nearly 115 percent. As reported by David Carr of The New York Times in an article critical of SOPA and PIPA, Google, Facebook, Twitter, and other companies sent a joint letter to Congress, stating \\"We support the bills' stated goals ‚Äì providing additional enforcement tools to combat foreign 'rogue' Web sites that are dedicated to copyright infringement or counterfeiting. However, the bills as drafted would expose law-abiding U.S. Internet and technology companies to new uncertain liabilities, private rights of action and technology mandates that would require monitoring of Web sites. We are concerned that these measures pose a serious risk to our industry's continued track record of innovation and job creation, as well as to our nation's cybersecurity.\\" Smith responded, saying, the article \\"unfairly criticizes the Stop Online Piracy Act\\", and, \\"does not point to any language in the bill to back up the claims. SOPA targets only foreign Web sites that are primarily dedicated to illegal and infringing activity. Domestic Web sites, like blogs, are not covered by this legislation.\\" Smith also said that Carr incorrectly framed the debate as between the entertainment industry and high-tech companies, noting support by more than \\"120 groups and associations across diverse industries, including the United States Chamber of Commerce\\". =Users uploading illegal content= Lateef Mtima, director of the Institute for Intellectual Property and Social Justice at Howard University School of Law, expressed concern that users who upload copyrighted content to sites could potentially be held criminally liable themselves, saying, \\"Perhaps the most dangerous aspect of the bill is that the conduct it would criminalize is so poorly defined. While on its face the bill seems to attempt to distinguish between commercial and non-commercial conduct, purportedly criminalizing the former and permitting the latter, in actuality the bill not only fails to accomplish this but, because of its lack of concrete definitions, it potentially criminalizes conduct that is currently permitted under the law.\\" An aide to Rep. Smith said, \\"This bill does not make it a felony for a person to post a video on YouTube of their children singing to a copyrighted song. The bill specifically targets websites dedicated to illegal or infringing activity. Sites that host user content‚Äîlike YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter‚Äîhave nothing to be concerned about under this legislation.\\" =Internal networks= A paper by the Center for Democracy and Technology claimed that the bill \\"targets an entire website even if only a small portion hosts or links to some infringing content.\\" According to A. M. Reilly of Industry Leaders Magazine, under SOPA, culpability for distributing copyright material is extended to those who aid the initial poster of the material. For companies that use virtual private networks (VPN) to create a network that appears to be internal but is spread across various offices and employees' homes, any of these offsite locations that initiate sharing of copyright material could put the entire VPN and hosting company at risk of violation. Answering similar criticism in a CNET editorial, Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) head, Cary Sherman wrote, \\"Actually, it's quite the opposite. By focusing on specific sites rather than entire domains, action can be targeted against only the illegal subdomain or Internet protocol address rather than taking action against the entire domain.\\" Impact on web- browsing software The Electronic Frontier Foundation expressed concern that free and open source software (FOSS) projects found to be aiding online piracy could experience serious problems under SOPA. Of special concern was the web browser Firefox, which has an optional extension, MAFIAAFire Redirector, that redirects users to a new location for domains that were seized by the U.S. government. In May 2011, Mozilla refused a request by the United States Department of Homeland Security to remove MAFIAAFire from its website, questioning whether the software had ever been declared illegal. Potential effectiveness Edward J. Black, president and CEO of the Computer & Communications Industry Association, wrote in the Huffington Post that \\"Ironically, it would do little to stop actual pirate websites, which could simply reappear hours later under a different name, if their numeric web addresses aren't public even sooner. Anyone who knows or has that web address would still be able to reach the offending website.\\" An editorial in the San Jose Mercury-News stated, \\"Imagine the resources required to parse through the millions of Google and Facebook offerings every day looking for pirates who, if found, can just toss up another site in no time.\\" John Palfrey of the Berkman Center for Internet & Society commented, \\"DNS filtering is by necessity either overbroad or underbroad; it either blocks too much or too little. Content on the Internet changes its place and nature rapidly, and DNS filtering is ineffective when it comes to keeping up with it.\\" Technical issues =Deep-packet inspection and privacy= According to Markham Erickson, head of NetCoalition, which opposes SOPA, the section of the bill that would allow judges to order internet service providers to block access to infringing websites to customers located in the United States would also allow the checking of those customers' IP address, a method known as IP address blocking. Erickson has expressed concerns that such an order might require those providers to engage in \\"deep packet inspection,\\" which involves analyzing all of the content being transmitted to and from the user, raising new privacy concerns. Policy analysts for New America Foundation say this legislation would \\"instigate a data obfuscation arms race\\" whereby by increasingly invasive practices would be required to monitor users' web traffic resulting in a \\"counterproductive cat-and-mouse game of censorship and circumvention [that] would drive savvy scofflaws to darknets while increasing surveillance of less technically proficient Internet users\\". =Domain Name System= The Domain Name System (DNS) servers, sometimes likened to a telephone directory, translate browser requests for domain names into the IP address assigned to that computer or network. The original bill requires these servers to stop referring requests for infringing domains to their assigned IP addresses. DNS is robust by design against failure and requires that a lack of response is met by inquiries to other DNS servers. Andrew Lee, CEO of ESET North America, objected that since the bill would require internet service providers to filter DNS queries for the sites, this would undermine the integrity of the Domain Name System. According to David Ulevitch, the San Francisco-based head of OpenDNS, the passage of SOPA could cause Americans to switch to DNS providers located in other countries who offer encrypted links, and may cause U.S. providers, such as OpenDNS itself, to move to other countries, such as the Cayman Islands. In November 2011, an anonymous top- level domain, .bit, was launched outside of ICANN control, as a response to the perceived threat from SOPA, although its effectiveness (as well as the effectiveness of other alternative DNS roots) remains unknown. On January 12, 2012, House sponsor Lamar Smith announced that provisions related to DNS redirection would be pulled from the bill. =Internet security= A white paper by several internet security experts, including Steve Crocker and Dan Kaminsky, wrote, \\"From an operational standpoint, a resolution failure from a nameserver subject to a court order and from a hacked nameserver would be indistinguishable. Users running secure applications need to distinguish between policy-based failures and failures caused, for example, by the presence of an attack or a hostile network, or else downgrade attacks would likely be prolific.\\" =Domain Name System Security Extensions= Stewart Baker, former first Assistant Secretary for Policy at the Department of Homeland Security and former General Counsel of the National Security Agency, stated that SOPA would do \\"great damage to Internet security\\" by undermining Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC), a proposed security upgrade for DNS, since a browser must treat all redirects the same, and must continue to search until it finds a DNS server (possibly overseas) providing untampered results. On December 14, 2011 he wrote that SOPA was \\"badly in need of a knockout punch\\" due to its impact on security and DNS: DNSSEC is a set of protocols developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) for ensuring internet security. A white paper by the Brookings Institution noted, \\"The DNS system is based on trust\\", adding that DNSSEC was developed to prevent malicious redirection of DNS traffic, and that \\"other forms of redirection will break the assurances from this security tool\\". On November 17, Sandia National Laboratories, a research agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, released a technical assessment of the DNS filtering provisions in the House and Senate bills, in response to Representative Zoe Lofgren's (D-CA) request. The assessment stated that the proposed DNS filtering would be unlikely to be effective, would negatively impact internet security, and would delay full implementation of DNSSEC.Leonard M. Napolitano, Jr., Sandia Nat'l Labs Letter, November 16, 2011 On November 18, House Cybersecurity Subcommittee chair Dan Lungren stated that he had \\"very serious concerns\\" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding, \\"we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it\\". Transparency in enforcement Brooklyn Law School professor Jason Mazzone warned, \\"Much of what will happen under SOPA will occur out of the public eye and without the possibility of holding anyone accountable. For when copyright law is made and enforced privately, it is hard for the public to know the shape that the law takes and harder still to complain about its operation.\\" Supporters =Legislators= The Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Representative Lamar Smith (R-TX) and was initially co-sponsored by Howard Berman (D-CA), Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), Mary Bono Mack (R-CA), Steve Chabot (R-OH), John Conyers (D-MI), Ted Deutch (D-FL), Elton Gallegly (R-CA), Bob Goodlatte (R-VA), Timothy Griffin (R-AR), Dennis A. Ross (R-FL), Adam Schiff (D-CA) and Lee Terry (R-NE). As of January 16, 2012, there were 31 sponsors. =Companies and organizations= The legislation has broad support from organizations that rely on copyright, including the Motion Picture Association of America, the Recording Industry Association of America, Entertainment Software Association, Macmillan US, Viacom, and various other companies and unions in the cable, movie, and music industries. Supporters also include trademark-dependent companies such as Nike, L'Or√©al, and Acushnet Company. Both the AFL‚ÄìCIO and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce support H.R. 3261, and many trade unions and industry groups large and small, have also publicly praised the legislation. In a joint statement, the American Federation of Musicians (AFM), American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), Directors Guild of America (DGA), International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees, Moving Picture Technicians, Artists and Allied Crafts of the United States, Its Territories and Canada (IATSE), International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT), and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) all showed support for SOPA. Smaller trade organizations, such as A2IM, which represents independent musicians, have also backed the bill. In June 2011, former Bill Clinton press secretary Mike McCurry and former George W. Bush advisor Mark McKinnon, business partners in Public Strategies, Inc., started a campaign which echoed McCurry's earlier work in the network neutrality legislative fight. McCurry represented SOPA/PIPA in Politico as a way to combat theft online,Mike McCurry, \\"Congress must combat online theft\\", Politico opinion piece, June 14, 2011. Retrieved November 30, 2011. drawing a favorable comment from the MPAA. On the 15th, McCurry and Arts + Labs co-chair McKinnon sponsored the \\"CREATE ‚Äì A Forum on Creativity, Commerce, Copyright, Counterfeiting and Policy\\" conference with members of Congress, artists and information-business executives. On September 22, 2011, a letter signed by over 350 businesses and organizations‚Äîincluding NBCUniversal, Pfizer, Ford Motor Company, Revlon, NBA, and Macmillan US‚Äîwas sent to Congress encouraging the passage of the legislation. Fightonlinetheft.com, a website of The Coalition Against Counterfeiting and Piracy (a project of the United States Chamber of Commerce Global Intellectual Property Center,) cites a long list of supporters including these and the Fraternal Order of Police, the National Governors Association, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, the National Association of Attorneys General, the Better Business Bureau, and the National Consumers League. On November 22 the CEO of the Business Software Alliance (BSA) said, \\"valid and important questions have been raised about the bill.\\" He said that definitions and remedies needed to be tightened and narrowed, but \\"BSA stands ready to work with Chairman Smith and his colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to resolve these issues\\".SOPA Needs Work to Address Innovation Considerations; Business Software Alliance; November 21, 2011 On December 5, the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a non-partisan non- profit, published an article that blasted critics of SOPA and defended the bill. The report called opponents' claims about DNS filtering \\"inaccurate,\\" their warnings against censorship as \\"unfounded\\" and recommended that the legislation be revised and passed into law. On December 22, Go Daddy, one of the world's largest domain name registrars, stated that it supported SOPA. Go Daddy then rescinded its support, its CEO saying, \\"Fighting online piracy is of the utmost importance, which is why Go Daddy has been working to help craft revisions to this legislation‚Äîbut we can clearly do better. It's very important that all Internet stakeholders work together on this. Getting it right is worth the wait. Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it.\\" In January 2012, the Entertainment Software Association announced support for SOPA, although some association members expressed opposition. Creative America, a group representing television networks, movie studios, and entertainment unions, produced a \\"fact vs. fiction\\" flyer that aimed to correct misperceptions about rogue sites legislation. =Others= Professor and Intellectual Property rights lawyer, Hillel I. Parness, a Partner of Robins, Kaplan, Miller & CiresiHillel I. Parness Biography; Robins, Kaplan, Miller & Ciresi Profiles; 19 January 2012 has reviewed the bill, stating in a legal analysis that \\"There's a court involved here.\\" In regards to \\"safe harbors,\\" he stated the safe harbor provisions created by the DMCA in 1998 would still apply. \\"I think the proponents of the bill would say, what we're looking at today is a very different kind of Internet. The fact that the courts have said that entities like YouTube can be passive when it comes to copyright infringement, and just wait for notices rather than having to take any affirmative action, is also frustrating to them\\", he said. Regarding censorship concerns, he explained that none of the criminal copyright statutes in the bill were new, and therefore, \\"if there was a risk of abuse, that risk has always been there. And I have confidence in the structure of our court system, that the prosecutors and the courts are held to certain standards that should not allow a statute such as this to be manipulated in that way.\\"Legal Analysis of SOPA / PROTECT- IP: No, It's Not Censorship; ReadWrite; November 23, 2011 Constitutional law expert Floyd Abrams, on behalf of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (AFTRA), the Directors Guild of America (DGA), the International Alliance of Theatrical and Stage Employees (IATSE), the Screen Actors Guild (SAG), the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and others, reviewed the proposed legislation and concluded, \\"The notion that adopting legislation to combat the theft of intellectual property on the Internet threatens freedom of expression and would facilitate, as one member of the House of Representatives recently put it, 'the end of the Internet as we know it,' is thus insupportable. Copyright violations have never been protected by the First Amendment and have been routinely punished wherever they occur; including the Internet. This proposed legislation is not inconsistent with the First Amendment; it would protect creators of speech, as Congress has done since this Nation was founded, by combating its theft.\\"Letter of Support to the House Judiciary Committee; Floyd Abrams; November 7, 2011 White House position On January 14, 2012, the Obama administration responded to a petition against the bill, stating that while it would not support legislation with provisions that could lead to Internet censorship, squelching of innovation, or reduced Internet security, it encouraged \\"all sides to work together to pass sound legislation this year that provides prosecutors and rights holders new legal tools to combat online piracy originating beyond U.S. borders while staying true to the principles outlined above in this response.\\" More than 100,000 people petitioned the White House in protest. Three officials from the Obama administration articulated the White House's position on proposed anti-piracy legislation, balancing the need for strong antipiracy measures while respecting both freedom of expression and the way information and ideas are shared on the Internet. \\"While we believe that online piracy by foreign websites is a serious problem that requires a serious legislative response, we will not support legislation that reduces freedom of expression, increases cybersecurity risk, or undermines the dynamic, innovative global Internet.\\" Opposition =Legislators= House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) expressed opposition to the bill, as well as Representatives Darrell Issa (R-CA) and presidential candidate Ron Paul (R-TX), who joined nine Democrats to sign a letter to other House members warning that the bill would cause \\"an explosion of innovation-killing lawsuits and litigation\\". \\"Issa said the legislation is beyond repair and must be rewritten from scratch\\", reported The Hill. Issa and Lofgren announced plans for legislation offering \\"a copyright enforcement process modeled after the U.S. International Trade Commission's (ITC) patent infringement investigations\\". Politico referred to support as an \\"election liability\\" for legislators. Subsequently, proponents began hinting that key provisions might be deferred with opponents stating this was inadequate. Representative Jared Polis (D-CO) has been known to lobby against SOPA in the game League of Legends, also making a post in the official game message boards. =Companies and organizations= EFF home page with the American Censorship Day banner Opponents include Google, Yahoo!, YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, AOL, LinkedIn, eBay, Mozilla Corporation, Mojang, Riot Games, Epic Games, Reddit, WikipediaJim Abrams (January 19, 2012), \\"A Q&A; on contested Internet anti-piracy bills\\" The Boston Globe, and the Wikimedia Foundation, in addition to human rights organizations such as Reporters Without Borders, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), the ACLU, and Human Rights Watch. Kaspersky Lab, a major computer security company, demonstrated its opposition to SOPA and \\"decided to discontinue its membership in the BSA\\". On December 13, 2011, Julian Sanchez of the libertarian think tank Cato Institute came out in strong opposition to the bill saying that while the amended version \\"trims or softens a few of the most egregious provisions of the original proposal... the fundamental problem with SOPA has never been these details; it's the core idea. The core idea is still to create an Internet blacklist...\\" The Library Copyright Alliance (including the American Library Association) objected to the broadened definition of \\"willful infringement\\" and the introduction of felony penalties for noncommercial streaming infringement, stating that these changes could encourage criminal prosecution of libraries. A Harvard law professor's analysis said that this provision was written so broadly that it could make mainstream musicians felons for uploading covers of other people's music to sites like YouTube. On November 22, Mike Masnick of Techdirt called SOPA \\"toxic\\" and published a detailed criticism of the ideas underlying the bill, writing that \\"one could argue that the entire Internet enables or facilitates infringement\\", and saying that a list of sites compiled by the entertainment industry included the personal site of one of their own artists, 50 Cent, and legitimate internet companies. The article questioned the effect of the bill on $2 trillion in GDP and 3.1 million jobs, with a host of consequential problems on investment, liability and innovation. Paul Graham, the founder of venture capital company Y Combinator opposed the bill, and banned all SOPA-supporting companies from their \\"demo day\\" events. \\"If these companies are so clueless about technology that they think SOPA is a good idea\\", he asks, \\"how could they be good investors?\\" Prominent pro-democracy movement, Avaaz.org started a petition in protest over SOPA and so far has got over 3.4 million signatures worldwide. The Center for Democracy and Technology maintains a list of SOPA and PIPA opponents consisting of the editorial boards of The New York Times, the Los Angeles Times, 34 other organizations and hundreds of prominent individuals. Zynga Game Network, creator of Facebook games Texas HoldEm Poker and FarmVille, wrote to the sponsors of both bills highlighting concerns over the effect on \\"the DMCA's safe harbor provisions ... [which] ... have been a cornerstone of the U.S. Technology and industry's growth and success\\", and opposing the bill due to its impact on \\"innovation and dynamism\\". (direct link to letter) =Others= Computer scientist Vint Cerf, one of the founders of the Internet, now Google vice president, wrote to Smith, saying \\"Requiring search engines to delete a domain name begins a worldwide arms race of unprecedented 'censorship' of the Web\\", in a letter published on CNet. (includes original text of letter by Vint Cerf) On December 15, 2011, a second hearing was scheduled to amend and vote on SOPA. Many opponents remained firm even after Smith proposed a 71-page amendment to the bill to address concerns. NetCoalition, which works with Google, Twitter, eBay, and Facebook, appreciated that Smith was listening, but says it nonetheless could not support the amendment. Issa stated that Smith's amendment, \\"retains the fundamental flaws of its predecessor by blocking Americans' ability to access websites, imposing costly regulation on Web companies and giving Attorney General Eric Holder's Department of Justice broad new powers to police the Internet\\". In December 2011, screenwriter and comics writer Steve Niles spoke out against SOPA, commenting, \\"I know folks are scared to speak out because a lot of us work for these companies, but we have to fight. Too much is at stake.\\" In January 2012, novelist, screenwriter and comics writer Peter David directed his ire at the intellectual property pirates whose activities he felt provoked the creation of SOPA. While expressing opposition to SOPA because of his view that the then-current language of the bill would go too far in its restriction of free expression, and would probably be scaled down, David argued that content pirates, such as the websites that had posted his novels online in their entirety for free downloads, as well as users who supported or took advantage of these activities, could have prevented SOPA by respecting copyright laws. Twenty-one artists signed an open letter to Congress urging them to exercise extreme caution, including Comedian Aziz Ansari, The Lonely Island music parody band, MGMT, OK Go, Jason Mraz and Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails. The letter reads, \\"As creative professionals, we experience copyright infringement on a very personal level. Commercial piracy is deeply unfair and pervasive leaks of unreleased films and music regularly interfere with the integrity of our creations. We are grateful for the measures policymakers have enacted to protect our works. [...] We fear that the broad new enforcement powers provided under SOPA and PIPA could be easily abused against legitimate services like those upon which we depend.

The Daily Shows Jon Stewart stated that SOPA will \\"break the Internet\\". According to a New York Times report (February 8, 2012), Art Brodsky of Public Knowledge said, \\"The movie business is fond of throwing out numbers about how many millions of dollars are at risk and how many thousands of jobs are lost ... We don't think it correlates to the state of the industry.\\" The report also noted that \\"some in the internet world, including Tim O'Reilly, ... go so far as to question whether illegitimate downloading and sharing is such a bad thing. In fact, some say that it could even be a boon to artists and other creators.\\" Tim O'Reilly is quoted as saying, \\"The losses due to piracy are far outweighed by the benefits of the free flow of information, which makes the world richer, and develops new markets for legitimate content ... Most of the people who are downloading unauthorized copies of O'Reilly books would never have paid us for them anyway.\\" International response Organizations in the international civil and human rights community expressed concerns that SOPA would cause the United States to lose its position as a global leader in supporting a free and open Internet for public good. On November 18, 2011, the European Parliament adopted by a large majority a resolution that \\"stresses the need to protect the integrity of the global Internet and freedom of communication by refraining from unilateral measures to revoke IP addresses or domain names\\". Private individuals petitioned the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, asking for the British government to condemn the bill. Vice-President of the European Commission and European Commissioner for Digital Agenda Neelie Kroes said she is \\"Glad [the] tide is turning on SOPA,\\" explaining rather than having \\"bad legislation\\" there \\"should be safeguarding benefits of open net\\". \\"Speeding is illegal too but you don't put speed bumps on the motorway\\", she said. Protest actions Mozilla's SOPA protest, displayed in Firefox on November 16, 2011 On November 16, 2011, Tumblr, Mozilla, Techdirt, the Center for Democracy and Technology were among many Internet companies that protested by participating in American Censorship Day.

Legislative history The House Judiciary Committee held hearings on November 16 and December 15, 2011. The Committee was scheduled to continue debate in January 2012, but on January 17 Chairman Smith said that \\"Due to the Republican and Democratic retreats taking place over the next two weeks, markup of the Stop Online Piracy Act is expected to resume in February.\\"\\"House to take up anti-piracy bill in February\\" Reuters January 17, 2012 However, in the wake of online protests held on January 18, 2012, Rep.

Reid announced that the PIPA test vote scheduled for January 24 would also be postponed.Stephanie Condon (20 January 2012),\\"PIPA, SOPA put on hold in wake of protests\\" CBS News =November 16 House Judiciary Committee hearing= At the House Judiciary Committee hearing, there was concern among some observers that the set of speakers who testified lacked technical expertise. Technology news site CNET reported \\"One by one, each witness‚Äîincluding a lobbyist for the Motion Picture Association of America‚Äîsaid they weren't qualified to discuss... DNSSEC.\\" Adam Thierer, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center, similarly said, \\"The techno-ignorance of Congress was on full display. Member after member admitted that they really didn't have any idea what impact SOPA's regulatory provisions would have on the DNS, online security, or much of anything else.\\" Lofgren stated, \\"We have no technical expertise on this panel today.\\" She also criticized the tone of the hearing, saying, \\"It hasn't generally been the policy of this committee to dismiss the views of those we are going to regulate. Impugning the motives of the critics instead of the substance is a mistake.\\" Lungren told Politico's Morning Tech that he had \\"very serious concerns\\" about SOPA's impact on DNSSEC, adding \\"we don't have enough information, and if this is a serious problem as was suggested by some of the technical experts that got in touch with me, we have to address it. I can't afford to let that go by without dealing with it.\\" Gary Shapiro, CEO of the Consumer Electronics Association, stated, \\"The significant potential harms of this bill are reflected by the extraordinary coalition arrayed against it. Concerns about SOPA have been raised by Tea Partiers, progressives, computer scientists, human rights advocates, venture capitalists, law professors, independent musicians, and many more. Unfortunately, these voices were not heard at today's hearing.\\" An editorial in Fortune wrote, \\"This is just another case of Congress doing the bidding of powerful lobbyists‚Äîin this case, Hollywood and the music industry, among others. It would be downright mundane if the legislation weren't so draconian and the rhetoric surrounding it weren't so transparently pandering.\\" =December 15 markup of the bill= Since its introduction, a number of opponents to the bill have expressed concerns. The bill was presented for markup by the House Judiciary Committee on December 15\\\\. An aide to Smith stated that \\"He is open to changes but only legitimate changes. Some site[s] are totally capable of filtering illegal content, but they won't and are instead profiting from the traffic of illegal content.\\" Markup outcome After the first day of the hearing, more than 20 amendments had been rejected, including one by Darrell Issa which would have stripped provisions targeting search engines and Internet providers. PC World reported that the 22‚Äì12 vote on the amendment could foreshadow strong support for the bill by the committee. The Committee adjourned on the second day agreeing to continue debate early in 2012. Smith announced a plan to remove the provision that requires Internet service providers to block access to certain foreign websites. On January 15, 2012, Issa said he has received assurances from Rep. Eric Cantor that the bill would not come up for a vote until a consensus could be reached. MPAA's continued efforts to enact SOPA principles The 2014 Sony Pictures hack revealed that the MPAA had continued its efforts to enact SOPA-like blocking principles since the bill died in Congress. The emails indicated that the MPAA was actively exploring new strategies to implement SOPA-like regulations, such as using the All Writs Act to \\"allow [the MPAA] to obtain court orders requiring site blocking without first having to sue and prove the target ISPs are liable for copyright infringement.\\" The MPAA has also allied itself with National Association of Attorneys General president Jim Hood, who supports SOPA principles and has stated that \\"Google's not a government‚Ä¶ they don't owe anyone a First Amendment right‚Ä¶ [i]f you're an illegal site, you ought to clean up your act, instead of Google making money off it.\\" On November 27, 2013, Hood sent a letter to Google outlining his grievances. It was later revealed that much of the letter was drafted by the law firm representing the MPAA. On October 21, 2014, Hood issued a subpoena to Google for information about, among other items, its advertising partnerships and practices concerning illegal and sexual content. Google requested an injunction to quash the subpoena from the United States District Court of the Southern District of Mississippi, Northern Division. Google was granted such an injunction on March 2, 2015. The injunction also prevented Hood from bringing a charge against Google for making third-party content available to internet users. Effectively, the injunction protected Google from having Hood's claims enforced until after the conclusion of the case. An MPAA spokesperson criticized Google's use of the First Amendment, accusing the company of using freedom of speech \\"as a shield for unlawful activities.\\" Leaders in the technology industry commended the federal court for issuing the injunction. In addition, one of Google's head lawyers noted that \\"[w]e're pleased with the court's ruling, which recognizes that the MPAA's long-running campaign to censor the web ‚Äî which started with SOPA ‚Äî is contrary to federal law.\\" See also * Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) * Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA) * Commercial Felony Streaming Act * Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) * Copyright bills in the 112th United States Congress * Copyright Term Extension Act (CTEA) * Cybercrime Prevention Act of 2012 (Philippines) * Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act * Digital Economy Act 2010 (in the UK) * Ley Sinde * Preventing Real Online Threats to Economic Creativity and Theft of Intellectual Property Act (PROTECT IP Act, or PIPA), the corresponding Senate bill * Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011 * Protests against SOPA and PIPA * Russian State Duma Bill 89417-6 * Splinternet * Trans-Pacific Partnership * Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership (TPP) * European Directive on Copyright in the Digital Single Market, which passed the European Parliament in March 2019 despite similar protests to the ones against SOPA/PIPA, expands copyright liability to websites.

Smith v.

Web. 03 November 2011. . Background =Historical Context= In the 1950s, many cases that dealt with freedom of expression came to the Supreme Court. The social and cultural effects of the Cold War had infringed upon, if not taken away, many of these freedoms, as all kinds of literature and other forms of expression were being carefully monitored. The era saw the rise of McCarthyism, where techniques as undemocratic as guilt by association, indiscriminant violation of privacy and unsupported accusations were used to censor the general population.Ceplair, Larry. \\"Mccarthyism Revisited.\\" Historical Journal of Film, Radio & Television 28.3 (2008): 405-414. Humanities International Complete. Web. 2 November 2011. It also saw the beginnings of the similar HUAC, or House Un-American Activities Committee, which carried out thousands of investigations into potentially communist activity in America. Many of its methods were highly unconstitutional, and the HUAC was responsible for the creation of the Hollywood blacklist.HUAC Methods and Motives William Schwartz, R. Hobart Ellis, Jr., Victor G. Wightman and Louis K. Acheson, Jr. Science, New Series, Vol. 154, No. 3747 (October 21, 1966), p. 330 Published by: American Association for the Advancement of Science Article Stable URL: https://www.jstor.org/stable/1719234 The material in question in Smith v. California did not have to do with matters of foreign affairs, but with obscenity. The outcome of Smith v. California was one that further supported the protection of freedom of the press guaranteed in the constitution.Constitutional Law: State Commission's Extralegal Censorship George F. Dunker, Jr. California Law Review, Vol. 51, No. 3 (August 1963), pp. 620‚Äì626 This trend in Supreme Court decisions would influence the coming Civil Rights Movement. =Case Background= Eleazar Smith, proprietor of a Los Angeles bookstore, was convicted of violating a city ordinance that made it unlawful \\"for any person to have in his possession any obscene or indecent writing, [or] book ... in any place of business where ... books ... are sold or kept for sale.\\" Smith, 361 U.S. at 148. California municipal and superior courts contended that Smith was criminally liable because of the possession of the obscene material, even though he had no knowledge of the contents of the book; in the law‚Äôs definition there was no acknowledgement of the scienter (intent or knowledge of criminal activity), and so the ordinance imposed a strict criminal liability. The appellant appealed on the grounds that if the law were in fact constructed this way, it would come into conflict with the Due Process Clause in the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution. Supreme Court Opinion =Summary of Majority Opinion= The Court found that the city ordinance that held Mr. Smith criminally liable was in violation of the freedom of the press, which was protected under the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court held that the free publication and distribution of books are protected under the constitution‚Äôs guarantee of freedom of the press, and that a bookseller, such as Eleazar Smith, plays a key role in this publication and distribution. The court also cited that legal doctrines and devices are not capable of application under the constitution if they would have the effect of inhibiting freedom of expression by making citizens afraid or reluctant to exercise that freedom. Further, although the constitution does not protect obscene material, the court deemed that the ordinance imposed an unconstitutional limitation on access to constitutionally protected material. This opinion was based on the belief that if booksellers were to be criminally liable without knowledge of content, they would restrict the books they sold to those that they had personally inspected. This would inevitably decrease the number of books being sold, and thus a limitation of public access would be imposed by States on books that were not obscene as well as obscene material. The court also was of the opinion that the ordinance contained no acknowledgement of the scienter, which was necessary for one to be criminally liable for possessing obscene material. The court‚Äôs decision concluded that constitutional barriers may exist to restrict a State‚Äôs power to prevent distribution of obscene materials. Further, the court found that the higher difficulty of restricting distribution of obscene material (because the bookseller is not criminally liable) was not reason enough to require a different decision. It closed saying that it was of great importance to protect freedom of speech and press from State interference, and the ordinance in question was exactly that, and thus it was deemed unconstitutional. =Concurring Opinion= The Court made it clear that the issue of obscenity did not factor into its decision. What mattered was that the ordinance made booksellers criminally liable for the mere possession of obscene books in their stores, without having proof that the bookseller had knowledge of the contents. This was found to be in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. It also stated that it consented to the fact that having obscene material could be seen as a criminal offense, but not without proof of the scienter. What constitutes proof of the scienter was something that troubled the court, but it was established that it would be a topic for another time. =Influence of Previous Supreme Court Decisions= In Near v. Minnesota, a similar 1931 case, Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes concluded that the first amendment alone did not fully protect a citizen‚Äôs right to freedom of expression from invasion by state action, and that these liberties were protected by the Due process clause in the Fourteenth Amendment. This became the opinion of the court in subsequent cases involving freedom of expression. Joseph Burstyn, Inc. v. Wilson (1952), and Grosjean v. American Press Co. (1936) affirmed that the free publication of books or other forms of printed word also fell under the protection of the Due Process Clause. Dennis v. United States (1951) found that \\"The existence of a Men‚Äôs Rea is the rule of, rather than the exception to, the principles of Anglo-American criminal jurisprudence.\\" Wieman v. Updegraff (1952) supported that the Due Process clause requires that individuals have scienter. Lambert v. California (1957) deemed that in order for a defendant to be punished for a crime, there must be a probability of his knowledge of the law before committing the crime.. Thornhill v. Alabama (1940) concluded that the separability of constitutional and unconstitutional applications of statutes may not apply if their effect is to leave a statute capable of having many unconstitutional applications. Roth v. United States (1957) stated that obscene speech and writings are not protected under the constitution. Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison, Wisconsin (1951) showed that a State‚Äôs power to restrict or prevent the distribution of obscene materials is not free from constitutional restrictions to any form of exercise of that power. =Dissenting Opinion= In the view of Justice Harlan, the question of whether the scienter is a necessary requirement to have criminal liability should be considered differently depending on whether the statute in question in at the Federal or State level. He was unconvinced by the court‚Äôs reasoning and believed that the ordinance was struck down based on generalities. The popular opinion of the court deemed that the ordinance should be removed because, without proof of the scienter, it would impose a limitation on material both obscene and not obscene. Justice Harlan disagreed with this claim and thought it to be more theoretical than practical. He also believed that the ordinance was not unconstitutionally applied merely because of the State‚Äôs refusal to admit expert testimony. Historical Significance and Influence on Subsequent Supreme Court Decisions Smith v. California set the precedent of the necessity of the inclusion of the scienter in obscenity statutes, and in doing so it further established that the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment would stand to protect freedom of expression from state interference. This decision made it safe and easy for book distributors to continue to disseminate the highest amount of written material that they could, which benefitted the general public by giving them access to as much as possible. Smith v. California became another decision that supported and protected freedom of expression, a fundamental liberty for Americans.Constitutional Law: State Commission's Extralegal Censorship George F. Dunker, Jr. California Law Review, Vol. 51, No. 3 (August 1963), pp. 620‚Äì626 The decision was cited in a number of subsequent cases involving the first amendment and criminal liability with obscenity issues. In Redrup v. New York (1967),. Ginsberg v. New York (1967),. and Stanley v. Georgia (1969),. among others, the Supreme Court referenced Smith v. California when presenting the reasoning for its decision. As more and more case decisions have followed the same precedents of protecting freedom of expression that Smith v. California did, the issue of obscenity has become less significant in the United States today.

Formed in 2001 by vocalist Virginie Goncalves, guitarist Patrick Garcia, and keyboardist Fabrice Desire. Since then Fabrice has left the band while Julien Nicolas and Laurent Lesina were added as the band's drummer and bassist respectively. They have played at the Metal Female Voices Festival and been main support for Epica and Tarja. They have released three albums. Their first album, Gaia, was produced by AVFP Production and released in 2005, and their second album, Lueurs, was produced by Season of Mist and released in 2009. Their third album, Anachromie, has been released in 2012. In April 2015, Virginie, Patrick (legitimate founders of the project) and Kevin (the last drummer) were forced out of the band.  History  The band formed in 2001 by Virginie Gonclaves and Fabrice Desire. In 2004 they were given an offer to record an album with AVFP. In 2005 their first album Gaia was released. In order to go on tour with this album they added Jeremie Vinet as bassist and Guillaume Dagnaud as drummer. Because Jeremie was working at the time they also added Laurent Lesina as Jeremie's spare. In 2007 founding member Fabrice left the band because he was about to be a father. Guillaume left later that year for the same reason. Laurent became the full-time bassist and the band replaced Guillame with Julien 'Jano' Nicolas as drummer. In 2009 Season of Mist produced and released their second album Lueurs. They are currently working with Season of Mist on their third studio album, Anachromie, which is expected to be released in 2012.  Touring  In 2008 Kells was invited to be support for Epica's French tour. After the release of Lueurs in 2009 they went on tour throughout Europe as a headliner, as Epica main support, and as Tarja Turunen main support respectively. In May 2011, Tarja invited Kells to join her and Leaves' Eyes in Switzerland and Germany. In 2012, they went on tour opening for Tristania along with Sarah Jezebel Deva and Sound Storm.  Musical style  Kells is a symphonic nu-metal band. They are influenced by nu-metal bands like Korn, Deftones, and Limp Bizkit while adding symphonic elements to the music similar to the ones used by Evanescence and Within Temptation.

Life Maurice van Essche was born 1906, in Antwerp, Belgium, the seventh of eleven children, of whom only eight survived infancy. The family was French-speaking despite its Flemish roots; his mother's maiden name was De Ridder. He studied art at the Brussels Academy in 1924 under James Ensor, but halted his studies in 1925 for lack of funding, first working in a stained glass studio, then designing wallpaper ‚Äì both of which experiences are actively reflected in many of his works. He also worked as a freelance cartoonist, but painted all the while. In 1933 he studied briefly under Henri Matisse in France (see Anecdotes), having met him by chance in an artist's supply shop in Cagnes, France. Thereafter he continued to paint and study full-time thanks to the sponsorship of his elder brother, Joseph Charles, and a group of friends. His break came in July 1939 when he won a scholarship in a competition organised by the Belgian Government, who commissioned him to undertake a painting expedition to the Belgian Congo. His travels and experiences there influenced him profoundly, and the visions and emotions of that period echoed through his work for the rest of his life. In 1940 his wife Lucette (n√©e Josz, 1908‚Äì1997) and son Ludovic (1935 ‚Äì ) fled German occupation of Belgium and joined him in the Congo. Lucette could not cope with tropical conditions and they moved to the relatively milder climate of the South African Cape rather than return to war- torn Europe. Early days in South Africa were difficult, and on occasion van Essche traded paintings and drawings for food and other essentials. But he soon became a prominent member of the South African art community, exhibiting locally and later in Europe as well. As an active member of The New Group he contributed strongly to contemporary art in South Africa. He had a solid knowledge of both modern art trends and the history of European painting which he imparted in his role as teacher, a profession he regarded as equally important as creating. He taught at theWitwatersrand Technical Art School from 1943 to 1945. In 1948 he founded the Continental School of Art in Cape Town, leaving in 1951 to become a lecturer at the Michaelis School of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town. He was appointed Professor of Fine Art in 1962 (see Anecdotes) and his success as a teacher is attested to by the number of his former pupils who have become prominent artists themselves. Van Essche retired from academia in 1971, but continued to paint prolifically, despite poor health, including several heart attacks. He travelled in Europe and eventually settled near Thonon, France, at his wife's behest. His health continued to deteriorate, and he could not travel to attend his own retrospective exhibition in Cape Town in 1974. He missed Africa terribly, painting African scenes while searching in vain for local inspiration. His new themes included hippies and musicians, but he destroyed much of this work. His European landscapes from this period are dark and depressed, in stark contrast to the vibrant African scenes that flowed nonetheless. His oils continued to sell well in South Africa, and his reputation grew. He succumbed to a heart attack in June 1977 following a fall, and poor medical care.

Art Van Essche's work exhibits contrasting influences, both artistic and environmental. From delicate renditions of the diffused tones of Flanders, to powerful depictions of Africa's landscapes, people and light, van Essche conveys unmistakable moods and a realism that is both beautifully poetic and strikingly honest. \\"There must be blood in my painting... I must remain human at all costs,\\" he wrote to his friend Baron Robert d'Huart in 1961. Education * 1924 Brussels Academy under James Ensor. * 1933 Lessons with Henri Matisse, Paris, France. Awards * 1930 Silver medal, International Exhibition, Antwerp * 1951 Chevalier de Leopold II, King Baudouin of Belgium (Knighthood) * 1966 Medal of Honour, South African Academy for Science and Art * 1972 Officer of Order of Leopold II, King Baudouin of Belgium Anecdotes Relationship with Henri Matisse: Maurice van Essche met Henri Matisse when buying paint in an artists' supply shop in 1933 in Cagnes, in the south of France. van Essche had just purchased the last tube of Lemon Yellow when Matisse entered the store and asked the clerk for the same article. On recognising the famous man, van Essche offered him the tube of paint. Matisse declined, but touched by the gesture invited van Essche to visit his studio. They formed a strong friendship and Matisse coached the young artist while in Cagnes, and later again in Paris. Resemblance to Le Corbusier: On his visits to Paris before and after the war, van Essche frequented many well-known contemporary artists and architects of the time. Due to some similarities in appearance, and especially the style of glasses both men wore, he was often mistaken for Le Corbusier, much to his delight and amusement. It is unknown whether the two ever met. As Professor of Fine Art at the University of Cape Town van Essche shared the position of Dean of Art and Architecture on an annual rotating basis with William Leonard Thornton WHITE, referred to by colleagues and friends as Thornton-White, until Thornton- White's death in 1965. Direct descendant of Peter Paul Rubens: In the book on Maurice van Essche by Carl B√ºchner, published by Tafelberg in 1967, B√ºchner mentions van Essche's direct descendance from the flemish grand master, a claim originating from and sustained by van Essche himself. While there is no reason to doubt van Essche's good faith, the basis for the claim is unknown and direct descendance has not been researched or proven to date.

By the time he reached high school, he was receiving a great deal of attention. As a 15-year-old on Marietta‚Äôs JV team, Robinson kicked a 51-yard field goal in a game. A local news station sent a crew out to verify the feat. It took a few tries, but Robinson duplicated the kick for the camera and was on the 6 o‚Äôclock news that night. As a senior, Robinson received several scholarship offers but chose the University of Georgia. He would have the chance to play as a freshman, and UGA seemed the perfect distance from home. Robinson was the team's leading scorer and made the All-SEC Freshman Team in 1977. He would make 1st team All-SEC in 1978, 1979 & 1980 and Playboy All-American in 1979 and 1980.

He is principally remembered for his habit of leaving carved inscriptions on rock faces in Utah and Colorado during his travels. At least eight such markings have been positively attributed to him, four of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Early life Julien's exact date and place of birth are unknown. He apparently lived in Saint Louis in the 1790s. The first written documents mentioning him are baptismal records from the Saint Louis Cathedral for three children born to Julien and his Native American wife Catherine in 1793, 1798, and 1801. Three children were christened and one was buried between 1798 and 1809. Julien soon began a working relationship with Saint Louis fur baron Jean-Pierre Chouteau, a connection which would provide him with employment as a trader and trapper throughout the Midwest; his name appears in Chouteau's ledgers as early as 1803. From 1805 to 1819 he owned land near Fort Madison in present-day Iowa, and in 1821 in the village of Prairie du Chien in what is now Wisconsin. Julien was mentioned in an 1808 letter by then-Governor of the Louisiana Territory Meriwether Lewis to Secretary of War Henry Dearborn as an \\"old and rispected trader among the Ioways.\\" Julien and his brother were in the military in northern Louisiana in 1809. Denis witnessed the 1815 Iowa Treaty and received licenses to trade on the upper Missouri River in 1816 and 1817. During this time he remained connected to the Chouteau and Robidoux families of Saint Louis. An entry dated December 26, 1825 in James Kennerly's journal at Fort Atkinson suggests that Julien shot and wounded another man. Kennerly was the fort's civilian sutler. Records of Julien in the Midwest cease after this point. In 1827, Julien made his first trip to the far west as a member of a party led by Fran√ßois Robidoux to recover cached furs. They passed through Taos, New Mexico and eventually reached \\"the land of the Utes\\" in what is now southern Utah and western Colorado. Nauhnan, son of Chief Tabby, told of a trading post established by \\"white man the Indians called 'Sambo' and the other one called 'Julie'\\", with these names thought to reference Denis Julien (\\"Julie\\") and Augustus Archambeaux (\\"Sambo\\"). According to Nauhnan, in 1828, Julien, Archambeaux, William \\"Toopchee\\" Reed, and Reed's 14-year-old son (or nephew) Jim Reed established the Reed trading post near a spring just south and east of the present-day settlement of Whiterocks, Utah in Uintah County.Nauhnan, son of Chief Tabby, as quoted by Milt Jacobs They brought the first butcher knives, coffee beans, and other articles to the area and traded them to the local Indians for furs. The trading post was short-lived and was sold to Antoine Robidoux in 1832, who built his own fort immediately east across the spring. Rock inscriptions Julien stayed on at Fort Robidoux until 1836, and the series of rock inscriptions he made during and after this time are the only record of his movements in the latter part of his life. The earliest known Julien inscription is located on the Uinta River about ten miles downstream of the former site of the Reed trading post, where he scratched his name and the date, \\"Denis Julien 1831\\", on a sandstone ledge. In doing so he became one of the first Europeans to leave a dateable mark in what is now Utah; only a 1776 inscription left by members of the Dom√≠nguez‚ÄìEscalante expedition in Glen Canyon and an 1825 inscription left by William Henry Ashley along the Colorado River predate him. Julien left dated marks in 1831, 1832, 1836, 1838, and 1844, apparently traveling up and down the Colorado and Green rivers in a boat assisted by a sail, since one of his inscriptions depicts a boat with a mast. Of the eight markings generally accepted as authentic Julien inscriptions, seven are in present-day Utah and one just across the state line in Colorado; two of these eight have evidently been lost in modern times, though they are considered reliably reported. An additional two inscriptions, both in Utah, are also sometimes mentioned alongside the others, though their authenticity is disputed by historians. Several of the Julien inscriptions were not rediscovered, or at least not brought to the attention of the general public, for more than a century after he made them. All of the genuine Julien graffiti consist of his full name or initials and the date, with French spellings. His carvings are typically found on flat surfaces of large boulders or canyon walls along perennial waterways and very close to the water level, and are distinguished by deep, bold incisions into the rock and frequent use of old-style French block letters (for example, a capital \\"J\\" that looks more like a modern capital \\"I\\" or \\"E\\"). They are often adjacent to much older prehistoric petroglyphs, as well as later inscriptions from cowboys, prospectors, and tourists. National Park Service photograph of the Hell Roaring Canyon inscription, July 2006 Four of Julien's inscriptions are listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places: * Hell Roaring Canyon inscription. Dated May 3, 1836. On a square rock face above the Green River near the mouth of Hell Roaring Canyon in southwestern Grand County, Utah. Some sources indicate that this inscription is located within Canyonlands National Park, but it is actually about north of the park's northern boundary. * Lower Red Lake Canyon inscription. Dated 1836. Near the top of a talus slope on the east bank of the Colorado River, just below the mouth of Lower Red Lake Canyon, Canyonlands National Park, San Juan County, Utah. Authenticity disputed. * Whirlpool Canyon inscription. Dated 1838. In a small alcove on the Green River a few miles downstream of Echo Park, Dinosaur National Monument, Moffat County, Colorado. * Julien Inscription Panel. Dated June 9, 1844. At the base of a large sandstone fin at least 15 miles inland from the nearest river, in the Devils Garden area of Arches National Park, Grand County, Utah. Authenticity disputed. A Denis Julien inscription from 1836 was rediscovered in lower Cataract Canyon by Otis R. Marston in 1964,http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm/singleitem/collection/USHS_Class/id/21866/rec/32 but is now buried under the reservoir behind Glen Canyon Dam. There is also an undated \\"DJ\\" inscription at the mouth of Chandler Creek in Desolation Canyon on the Upper Green River. It is located on a large boulder to the left of the road as the road comes out on to the bottom of the canyon.

Filmed on location in France, Djibouti, and Tajikistan, the film shows a group of elite French naval commandos on a desperate hostage rescue mission in the Afghanistan/Pakistan area. Plot summary Kabul-based French journalist Elsa Casanova (Diane Kruger) writes an article about warlord Zaief (Raz Degan) and names him \\"the butcher of Kabul\\". Her informer Maina (Morjana Alaoui) warns her that Zaief is out for vengeance. Before she returns to Zaief, she bids farewell because she reckons to die by an honour killing. Elsa tries to hold her back but fails. Her friend Amen (Mehdi Nebbou) urges Elsa to leave the country, yet, agrees to help her try to save Maina. Zaief ambushes and captures Elsa and Amen. Amen asks Elsa to show no fear in front of Zaief. Still, she breaks down when their friend Salemani (Greg Fromentin) gets cruelly murdered in her presence. Zaief publishes film material of Salemani's gruesome death, which eventually reaches the French government. A small joint team of French Naval Commandos and 11th Parachute Brigade members gets entrusted with Elsa's rescue. They find Zaief's hideout in Pakistan and witness execution of Maina. When they leave the place with Elsa and Amen, a bullet hits their wireless set. Without means to contact their base, they cannot manage to be found and picked up. In lack of any other solution, they are heading for the Khyber Pass in order to reach their base in Afghanistan on foot. In the mountains, they have another shoot-out with Zaief's gunmen. When the fugitives come across a village, Elsa asks for hospitality. While they enjoy themselves with the locals, Marius (Alain Alivon) is suddenly killed by a sniper, who is killed by the team's own marksman Elias (Rapha√´l Personnaz). Later on, Zaief's gunmen arrive, and Zaief himself kills Amen. When Victor is hit, they retreat into the mountains. Elias is the second of the team to be killed while luring Zaief's soldiers away. Victor, Kovax, Tic-Tac, Lucas, and Elsa soon run into a snowstorm, but Victor subsequently goes into shock and dies. Once again Zaief attacks, and Lucas is killed, Tic-Tac is injured and Kovax kills Zaief after he takes Elsa hostage. They still have a long way ahead of themselves when they are surprised by a debris avalanche. Kovax saves Elsa and Tic-Tac but in the process breaks one of his legs. The two men persuade Elsa to leave them behind. Elsa, marked by severe exhaustion, scarcely reaches a road where she is rescued. She refuses to return to Paris and has herself taken out of her wheelchair by Admiral Guezennec (Tch√©ky Karyo) who carries her on his back to a helicopter. Together they find Kovax and Tic-Tac still alive.

History During the last half of the 1940s with the return of hundreds of thousands of veterans from the Second World War, there arose an acute housing shortage as these vets married and began to raise their families. Many of them lived with parents or other relatives until the U.S. Congress passed legislation creating the Federal Housing Administration and authorizing it to contract with local authorities to construct temporary veterans housing.\\"U. S. Needs 16,000,000 New Homes in Ten Years,\\" Life Magazine 19, no 25 17 Dec 1945, p33. Under this authorization, the Chicago Housing Authority contracted to lease a parcel of land from the Cook County Forest Preserve District. The area in Norwood Park Township northwest of Chicago, between Montrose Ave. on the north and Berteau Ave. on the south and between Thatcher Ave. on the east and Pueblo Ave. (later renamed Cumberland Ave.) on the west, was designated as one of those temporary housing sites and was named Thatcher Homes.\\"Vets Will Have Home in Forest Preserve Area\\", Chicago Sun-Times, Mar 4, 1946 The agency contracted with Stran-Steel, a Division of Great Lakes Steel Corporation, and Kimberly-Clark, maker of recently declassified Kimsul insulation, to erect approximately 184 units patterned after the Nissen Quonset Hut that had been so successful in Alaska and other areas of the Pacific.\\"Quonset: Metal Living for the Modern Age.\\" by Chris Chiel and Julie Decker; Dec 31, 2005, p 98. Because of the difficulty in placing furniture against the curved walls of the Quonset, the plan was later modified to include approximately 57 barracks-like structures with straight walls. While the Quonsets were built over plywood floors on steel joists placed directly on the ground, the barracks were slightly elevated on wooden joists over an 18 ‚Äì 24\\" crawl space which aided in heating them during the winter months. Construction began in 1946 and was completed before the end of 1947 when the first families began to move in. The external construction utilized corrugated sheet steel for roofs and siding while the portions which contacted the ground were covered with a 3/16\\" thick asbestos shingle which measured 2‚Äô x 4‚Äô. Provisions of the lease agreement between the housing authority and the forest preserve undoubtedly called for preservation of foliage and natural drainage patterns. No trees were allowed to be cut and the diagonal drainage swale ditch that divided the acreage was to remain unchanged. The main street of crushed rock and gravel (called Robinson Drive in honor of the Potawatomie Indian chief who once lived nearby) ran parallel to and about 50‚Äì60 feet north of the drainage ditch. Pittsburg Avenue with a slight jog to the east was extended northward from that location parallel to Thatcher which remained a gravel covered back road. Hutchinson Drive ran parallel to the main street from the alley between Pontiac and Plainfield to Pittsburg Avenue. The local Canty Branch School established a Kindergarten in the building set aside for that use midway (at 8220) on Robinson Drive. A Certified / Centrella Grocery Store shared an oversized quonset with a Laundromat just west of the school.Great Lakes Steel Corporation, Stran-Steel Division advertisement, Saturday Evening Post, 15 May 1948. The lease period evidently expired at the end of 1954 when all of the residents were required to vacate the units. They were demolished in late 1954 and early 1955. Only the fire hydrants remain where the gravel streets used to be. Occasional requests by children and grandchildren to show them where mom and dad or grandma and grandpa lived when they were very young had to be limited to a short walk through the picnic grounds until a U.S.G.S. aerial survey map of 1951 was located and gave evidence to this long since forgotten part of unincorporated Norwood Park Township.U.S.G.S.

Powers was active as Youth Lagoon from 2010 up until he formally retired the project in 2016. Powers announced his return with his new self-titled project in May of 2018. Powers' music has been described as electronic and experimental with elements of pop. As Youth Lagoon Powers was active as Youth Lagoon from 2010 to 2016. Youth Lagoon's music was described as neo- psychedelia, and included elements of Americana and experimental. Youth Lagoon's debut album, The Year of Hibernation, was released on Fat Possum Records on September 27, 2011. Based on minimalism and hypnotic ambience melded with atmospheric and electronic elements, the debut explored themes such as psychological dysphoria and mental distress. Powers' second album, Wondrous Bughouse, was released on March 5, 2013 by Fat Possum. It was spawned from what he described as \\"becoming more fascinated with the human psyche and where the spiritual meets the physical world.\\" During the time he composed the album, Powers became intrigued with the metaphysical universe and blending those ideas with pop music.Carrie Battan, \\"Youth Lagoon Announces New Album,\\" Pitchfork, January 4, 2013. Powers' tour in support of Wondrous Bughouse was cut short due to the death of a close friend. On November 12, 2014, Powers announced, via Twitter, that writing for his third album had been finished. Recording started in January 2015. The July 10, 2015 release of \\"The Knower\\", a free single-sided 7\\" single, marked the announcement of his third album, Savage Hills Ballroom, released on September 25, 2015. In July 2015, Youth Lagoon announced a US tour in support of Savage Hills Ballroom. On February 1, 2016, Powers announced on Twitter that his Youth Lagoon project was concluding.Alex Young, \\"Trevor Powers announces end of Youth Lagoon,\\" Consequence of Sound, February 1, 2016. Under his own name On May 2, 2018, Powers announced his return to music by issuing a personal letter along with the single \\"Playwright\\", his first song release since 2015. The letter elaborated on Power's self-titled project, highlighting the project as a new work. On May 20, 2018, he announced that he would release his first album under his own name, Mulberry Violence, in late 2018. Powers released two more singles from the forthcoming album, \\"Ache\\" and \\"Plaster Saint\\" with a newly penned letter providing more insight into the project: On July 29, 2020, Powers surprise-released his second album as Trevor Powers, titled Capricorn, along with limited-edition cassettes and booklet designed by Los Angeles-based designer Collin Fletcher, who also designed the artwork for the album. Recorded somewhere near the Sawtooth Mountains, Trevor Powers‚Äô Capricorn plays like a fairy tale or alien quest. Fragmented and full of grace, it serves as a meditation on the passage of time ‚Äî existing both in the past and future. After a severe panic attack made his legs numb for a week, Powers knew something had to change. ‚ÄúControl is our god,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúBut it‚Äôs an illusion. We think we can dictate every day of our lives but that‚Äôs like playing chess during an earthquake. Sometimes the pieces move themselves.‚Äù Drawing influence from Keiichi Koike‚Äôs Ultra Heaven, Richard Teschner‚Äôs puppets, and ancient folklore, Capricorn surfaced. After finding a cabin near the Sawtooths with an old piano, Powers filled his back seats with instruments, cassette recorders, and a computer, and left for a month alone. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve forgotten how bizarre our planet is,‚Äù he explains. ‚ÄúInsects are their own gospel choir. Rain is a fucking fever dream. The more Earth I included, the more alien it felt.‚Äù Capricorn paints a world of melancholia and unsettling beauty. Powers‚Äô field recordings, classical motifs, and software sculptures don‚Äôt stop time; they examine it like a beetle under a microscope ‚Äî exposing that the extraordinary is often hidden in plain sight. ‚ÄúFrom the minute we wake up, we‚Äôre in a trance,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis is music for our digital coma.‚Äù Discography =As Youth Lagoon= Studio albums *The Year of Hibernation (2011, Fat Possum Records) *Wondrous Bughouse (2013, Fat Possum Records) *Savage Hills Ballroom (2015, Fat Possum Records) Singles *Youth Lagoon 7\\" (2011, Fat Possum Records) *\\"Mute\\" promo CD (2013, Fat Possum Records) *\\"The Knower\\" 7\\" (2015, Fat Possum Records) =As Trevor Powers= Studio albums * Mulberry Violence (2018, Baby Halo) * Capricorn (2020, Fat Possum Records) Singles * \\"Playwright\\" digital (2018, Baby Halo) * \\"Ache\\" digital (2018, Baby Halo) * \\"Plaster Saint\\" digital (2018, Baby Halo) External links * Trevor Powers Website References Category:American pop musicians Category:Fat Possum Records artists Category:Musicians from Idaho Category:Musicians from San Diego Category:People from Boise, Idaho Category:1989 births Category:Living people ","title":"Trevor Powers"},{"id":"33630041","text":"Naseerabad Shahriar, District 1, Baghestan Baghestan (; formerly, Khademabad (Persian: ÿÆÿßÿØŸÖ ÿ¢ÿ®ÿßÿØ), also Romanized as KhƒÅdemƒÅbƒÅd and KhƒÅdamƒÅbƒÅd; also known as KhƒÅdemƒÅbƒÅd-e Qods and Muslemabad) is a city in the Central District of Shahriar County, Tehran Province, Iran.

In 1994, South Salem High School coach Barry Adams and Beaverton High School coach Nick Robertson, along with the Oregon Athletic Coaches Association, proposed a pre- season tournament to showcase the upcoming season's top teams. After two years of phone calls, lobbying and meetings, the Oregon State Activities Association approved the proposition and the Oregon Holiday Invitational (renamed in 2000 The Les Schwab Invitational) was born. Since its creation, the tournament has hosted nationally ranked teams from many states including Virginia, New York, Nevada, Louisiana, Texas, Maryland and numerous top teams from California.

Blue lines represent the older, inner city wall. Red lines represent the newer, outer city wall. The Walls of Stockholm () were a medieval fortification and defense system that would protect the city from attack from all sides. While the old city walls construction and process are largely unknown, the youngest city walls are now relatively well documented. In Stockholm, there have been two medieval city walls: an older one, internal, built at the end of the 13th and early 14th century, and more recent ones built during the 15th and 16th centuries. The younger remparts lost its strategic importance in the 17th century and began to be demolished. A small remnant of Stockholm's northern city walls that were on Helgeandsholmen can now be seen in the museum of medieval Stockholm. History =13th-century walls= 1685 Merchant's Gate in K√∂pmantorget, as depicted in a painting by Elias Brenner. Stockholm's oldest city wall was originally a fortification line built during the second half of the 13th century around Stadsholmen.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 37 This line of fortifications is thus intimately connected with the origin of Stockholm, founded by Birger Jarl around the year 1250. The old city wall exact design and location is disputed and unknown. According to one common belief, they are remnants of the oldest city wall preserved in buildings where the wall once was. At the excavations and building surveys, however, such residues have never been found.Hansson (1976), p. 40 A likely location for the city wall west route is along Pr√§stgatan west side, while the eastern wall followed along Bollhusgr√§nds and Baggensgatans east side. The precise location is difficult to determine specially because the wall moved outward as the city grew.Hansson (1976), pp. 42-43 The wall indeed was found in the surviving tax records of the latter half of the 15th century where the concept of 'prior to the wall' was used for the taxpayers who lived on the plateau of Stadsholmen.Dalb√§ck (1995), p. 40 'Between the wall' was a common term for the city area between Pr√§stgatan, Bollhusgr√§nd and Baggensgr√§nd. These streets were Stockholm's inner ring roadsHansson (1976), p. 44 that enveloped the heart-shaped of the Stadsholmens. Much of today's Pr√§stgatan and Baggensgr√§nd served as look-out points to the end of the north part of Tre Kronor castle. The southern tip of the city wall, including its southern port, was wiped out in the 14th century when the Black Friars' Monastery was built at this location. Even the city wall construction differ in concepts. It may have been a granite-stone wall with an upper section of bricks. The west side, probably started as part of √Ösbranten, while the eastern wall stood alone, both being approximately 7 meters high.Hansson (1976), p. 47-50 Stockholm's oldest city walls may also have been a wooden construction, a type of palisade, which could well explain why it has not to date been found.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 42 The city wall had four towers. The west wall stood to the north of St. Nicholas port, Shoemaker Gate and the Water Gate in the far south. The eastern wall had a door, the Merchant's Gate. It laid as an extension of Merchant Street approximately where the Merchant Square is today, and remained until the 1685 Merchant's Gate was portrayed by Elias Brenner shortly before demolition on 30 April 1687 'for its narrow passage sake'. The vault was in reality much narrower, about 1.6 m.Hansson (1976), p. 51 During the late 14th century people began to build plots outside the city walls. These lands had been gradually extended by paddings, and through rectification and land elevations. When Stockholm's oldest city walls lost its strategic significance, a new defensive wall was built further west and east. =15th- century walls= The new city wall was built in stages. Already in the 14th century a new defensive wall was built at the north-west part of Stadsholmen around Myntgatans street and to the north of Stora Nygatans route. The wall first protected the area outside the city centre, and the defensive line moved around 30 metres to the west. During a transitional period, there was also a wooded bank out there in the water. Remnants of this frontline fortifications could be documented in the 1940s, in connection with the excavation works in Kanslihusannexet and Kvarteret Cephalus.Hansson (1976), pp. 70-71 Northern city gate in 1535 as depicted in the V√§dersolstavlan painting. In the 15th century the construction of the city walls continued both to the west towards Lake M√§laren and in the east towards Saltsj√∂n until the 16th century. Moreover barricades were adapted all the time to the prevailing political and military- technical conditions. Therefore, the wall reinforcement was concentrated in the direction in which attacks on Stockholm was likely to come. This means that the wall to the east and Saltsj√∂n strengthened during periods in which a Danish invasion by sea was feared,For example, during Sten Sture the Elder time in 1400 century while reinforcements of M√§larmuren was carried out during the first part of Gustav Vasa's reign (c. 1530-1540), when attacks from domestic insurgents via M√§laren was feared to come.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 43 Gustav Vasa led even the renewal of the outer defenses around Norreport, on Helgeandsholmen's northern part. The wall on Helgeandsholmen was built around 1530 in direct proximity to the former defence line. Today, Norreport's residues were found in the middle of Mynttorget. These were examined in 1935, 1939 and 1982 when excavation work for wiring began. The inner Norreport was first mentioned in 1409, but is probably older than that.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 45 The gate was demolished in 1672 and the upper part of the city wall in 1674. An approximately 55-meter long piece of the northern mound was dug up from 1978 to 1981 for the renovation of the Riksdag building, which now is one of the main attractions of the Museum of Medieval Stockholm. The original height was most probably six feet. Near the eastern end of the wall there was a great port with an outer door of iron.Informationsskylt i Medeltidsmuseet Gustav Vasa had a fortress built of bricks, including those from St. Johanneskyrkan.Ahnlund (1961), p. 48 In V√§dersolstavlan from 1535 two south towers (S√∂dertorn), which appear to have been semi-circular in shape, were reported. The inner (north) tower was re-erected in 1524 after the it had collapsed the previous year. The outer (southern) tower originally had a roof hood. In 1637 the inner and outer S√∂derport were described, the latter to make way for the first lock, known as the Drottning Kristinas sluss (Queen Kristina's gate), which opened in 1642.Slussen Arkeologisk utredning 2007, p. 21 Gr√•munketornet to the left of the archway and Lejontornet in middle of the picture, behind the boathouses, as depicted in the V√§dersolstavlan painting. Around 1530 Gustav Vasa built two towers in Gr√•munkeholmen's northwest side. The northern tower, named after Birger Jarl's Tower was built with an unusual brick format during the 1700s, the same kind of brick that was used in Santa Clara Monastery, which was described in 1527. The south tower is now part of Wrangel Palace. It has also been found that the bricks for the tower had been used before, and that the mortar residue is not derived from the tower construction. Birger Jarl's Tower should therefore have been built of bricks from the Clara convent, during a two-year period that began in the autumn of 1527. The Birger Jarl's Tower was built in the 1200s, but the myth began to spread in the 1700s. It was Stockholm's oldest building then.Hansson (1976), p. 254 Stockholm's younger city wall had about 20 towers, in addition to the ones in Helgeandsholmen and Gr√•munkeholmen.Hansson (1976), map page 18-19 They were: Inre Norretorn (at today's mynttorget), Gr√•munketorn (at the level of today's Stora Gr√•munkegr√§nd), Inre S√∂dertorn (where today's slussplan) and Skultatornet (in present-day's Drakens gr√§nd). In between there were many defence towers, which were not all named. A few have been investigated by various arhceologists during the excavation work, such as a tower at Kolm√§targr√§nd in kvarteret Cephalus. Along the west side wall there was also a Pulvertornet (Powder Tower, or Gunpowder Tower) and Bocktornet (Bock Tower).Hansson (1976), p. 115 Fiskestrand towards Saltsj√∂n, in present-day Kvarteret Diana, was flanked by two towers. In the west there was Lilla tornet (Little Tower) and Stora tornet (Big Tower), the latter also referred to as the Lejontornet or Leijontornet (Lion Tower). A so-called dendrochronology survey, or tree-ring dating conducted in 1984, showed that the timber to the foundation piles for the Lion Tower was harvested in the winter of 1382-1383.V√§dersolstavlan from 1525 shows the Lion Tower, behind the boathouses. Part of the Lion Tower foundations can also be seen in the restaurant Leijontornet. Figures according to Restaurant Leijontornet. Pile drivers Double pile driver from the 16th century, with its large \\"bolt\\", according to Olaus Magnus. Stockholm younger walls surrounded the city in full. It was above all the city's port areas which were open, in the west at Kornhamn and in the east at Kogghamn and Fisketorget. These were weak points in the city's defence. In the Middle Ages, therefore, pile drivers were added in M√§laren, Saltsj√∂n and around the Stadsholmens respectively, southern and northern parts. The early pile drivers consisted of bars made of joined logs. In the Middle Ages this defense mechanism was simply called the \\"bommen\\".Hannson (1976), p. 284 It was later expanded for it is mentioned in the Stockholm first surviving official book from 1419. There has been talk about the nyckelf√∂rvarare to the bars at Fisketorget, Korntorget, at Lejontornet and Draktornet.Hannson (1976), p. 286 Pile drivers, as they appear in 16th-century illustrations, consisted of dual deep foundations connected with longitudinal and transverse logs. Outside Kornhamn better wood was required because of the sheer depth of water. During the 1500s, the estate purchased several hundred piles which were 24 metres long or more. Later, it was difficult to deal with so very long timbers, so they began to experiment with nails and forged joint rings. For the recovery of the piles in the bottom of the lake a special pile driver mounted on the city's barge was used. In winter it could crack down piles of ice.Hansson (1976), p. 285 The pile drivers were entry openings were closed with bars at night. They functioned both as a tariff ceiling and border for the inner harbor area. In order to further make it more difficult for the enemy to reach Stadsholmens, ships were sunk inside the perimeter of the pile drivers during the Danes' siege in 1520.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 44 This defense works can be seen on many older designs, such as Hogenbergs 1500-century Civitates orbis terrarum engravings of Stockholm, the Blodbadsplanschen from 1524 and on the V√§dersolstavlan from 1535. Demolition Stockholm city walls served their purpose for many centuries. No foreign or domestic forces succeeded in pushing Stockholm's defensive walls. The Danes, under Christian II of Denmark, were able to invade Stockholm on 7 September 1520 due to the city capitulation after the a series of blockades and intense pressure.Dahlb√§ck (1995), p. 187 The city's protected location on an island meant that it was difficult to be taken. Hostile attacks on Norreport and S√∂derport failed. Olaus Magnus wrote: \\"The Stockholm ports incurred Danish kings greater costs accrued in the unsuccessful assault trial than the ten largest cities in their own kingdom.\\"H√∂gberg (1981), p. 126 During Gustav Vasa a national defense task was organized and the enemy would meet far outside the capital. He led in 1540 the construction of Vaxholm as a barrier against hostile fleets, while he turned the Gripsholm Castle and Uppsala Castle into real fortifications.H√∂gberg (1981), p. 127 During Gustav II Adolf's reign the transformation of the town from medieval to a modern European metropolis began. The city engaged in trade and shipping, and there was no invasion threat anymore. The city wall had had its day and it prevented even the city's expansion. The M√§larmuren was first described in 1630. In 1625 there was a fire disaster, called \\"stora v√•delden\\" or the big wildfire, which wiped out the southwestern part of Stadsholmen and it was the start of the demolition of the city wall and its towers for Stockholm's first major street marketing. Saltsj√∂muren disappeared during the 1600s. The material was used both as building material for new houses and edifications, especially along the east side where the newly acquired land of Stockholm to the east was built: Skeppsbron. The demolition of the Stockholm young city wall was carried out so thoroughly that today it cannot be seen anywhere above ground level in Gamla stan.

Prior to the 2015-16 basketball season, the decision was made to change a lyric in the song from \\"Georgia State is in the fight\\" to \\"Georgia State will win the fight.\\" Uses The fight song is often featured outside of sports events, namely during pep rallies and other school sponsored events. =Football= At football games, the fight song is featured prior to kickoff during the \\"Panther Walk\\", when the football team enters the Georgia State Stadium to begin warm-ups. It is also featured prior to kickoff during the marching band's opening performance, and again during the marching band's half time performance. Generally it is performed while the band is leaving the field. During football games, the extended version of the fight song is played after the football team performs a significant play. After a touchdown, the extended version of \\"Fight Panthers\\" begins playing, and continues (though significantly dimmed) through the PAT. Once the PAT is scored, the volume is again raised and the fight song finished. After the completion of the game, the fight song is played. =Basketball= A pep band is used during basketball games that is significantly smaller than the marching band. Prior to the game the fight song is played. Also, during time outs the fight song is repeated amongst other songs. Following the conclusion of the game, the band performs the fight song. Variations There are two versions of \\"Fight Panthers\\", one full length and one shortened. The full- length version repeats the verse a second time after the chant \\"G-S-U, G-S-U, G-A-S-T-A-T-E, STATE!\\" (during a bridge between the first verse and repeat of that verse). The shortened version only features the first two bars of the extended version and then heads straight into the ending \\"G-S-U\\" bar. After the fight song finishes on both the extended and shortened versions, the 'G-S-U, G-S-U, G-A-S-T-A-T-E, STATE!' chant is repeated again. The student section often replaces the \\"G-S-U, G-S-U, G-A-S-T-A-T-E, STATE!\\" line with \\" G-S-U, G-S-U, WE'RE GONNA BEAT THE HELL OUT OF YOU, STATE!\\" They also often replace the \\"we're gonna give 'em hell\\" line with \\"we're gonna kick their ass!\\" References External links * Fight song audio and lyrics Category:Georgia State Panthers Category:American college songs Category:College fight songs in the United States Category:Sun Belt Conference fight songs ","title":"Fight Panthers"},{"id":"33630771","text":"Columns in the form of Toltec warriors in Tula Figure from Chichen Itza, dated 900-1250 Atlantean figures are carved stone support columns or pillars in the shape of fierce men in Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica. These figures are considered to be \\"massive statues of Toltec warriors\\". They take their name from the European tradition of similar Atlas or Atalante figures in classical architecture, which was then revived in the Renaissance and especially popular in Baroque architecture. Atlantean here refers to the figures' supporting posture, alluding to the load-bearing Titan Atlas, \\"Pertaining to, or having the supporting strength of, Atlas.\\" not Atlantis. Though the most famous Atlantean figures reside in Tula, the Olmecs were the first to use Atlantean figures on a relief discovered in Potrero Nuevo. Mayan sculptors also created Atlantean figures in Chichen Itza. Furthermore, the Aztecs, who greatly admired the Toltecs, created warrior statues strongly inspired by the Atlantean figures in Tula.  Composition  Atlantean figures were made out of the available stone in the area they were created. Atlantean figures have been made using limestone, sandstone, and volcanic rock. They were carved by hand, presumably by multiple individuals at once. To carve them, sculptors would have used stone tools, such as small chisels for fine sculpting, scrapers of various sizes to shape and add little details, and stone hammers to break the stones. Additional smaller and softer stones were used for smoothing. Creating these figures would have been very time-consuming, which is an indication that they were important to the civilizations who created them.  Earliest example of Atlantes in Mesoamerica  Xalapa, Veracruz. The sculpture represents the first use of atlantes in Mesoamerica. However, it differs from the Atlantean figures in Tula because it is not in-the-round, and is instead a relief on a table.alt=left At Potrero Nuevo near San Lorenzo, part of San Lorenzo Tenochtitl√°n, there is an altar supported by two Atlantean figures. The Olmecs created this altar. At the moment, it is believed to be the \\"oldest Mesoamerican example of the themes of atlantes holding up altars or ceilings\\" The atlantes at this site are also unique compared to those found at other sites. The atlantes are not carved in the round like they are at later sites. Instead they are carved as a relief.  Toltec Atlantean figures from Tula  The four monumental Atlantean figures in Tula were located on top of Pyramid B. Originally, they provided the support for a structure on top of the pyramid. Tula has long been considered the capital for the Toltec people. At Tula one can find the Temple of Tlahuizcalpantecuhtli ('House of the Morning Star'), where there are four Atlantean figures standing over tall. The figures here are depicted as wearing \\"stylized butterfly breastplates, sun- shaped shields on their backs, feathered headdresses and carry spear throwers and a supply of spears\\". = Dating = The exact dates for when Atlantean figures in Tula were carved is unknown. However, rough estimates can be made by dating the sites. The construction of the Toltec empire has been dated to approximately A.D. 750. This dates mark the earliest time that the figures could have been carved.  Other sites  = Mayan Atlantean figures from Chichen Itza = A group of Atlantean figures created by the Maya peoples from Chichen Itza Built by the Maya people, Chichen Itza is a site located on the northern centre of the Yucatan Peninsula and contains what is known as the Temple of Warriors. At the top of the temple, used as support for the roof, run columns of the carved warriors, each wearing a feathered headdress, a butterfly-shaped pectoral, and holding a dart thrower and darts. Like the Atlantean figures in Tula, the figures from Chichen Itza cannot be dated exactly. The construction of Chichen Itza took place around A.D. 100-250, which is the earliest that the figures could have been carved. = Aztec Atlantean figures from Tenochtitlan = Inspired by the Atlantean sculptures at Tula, Aztec sculptors built warrior sculptures with great resemblance to those created by the Toltecs. The Aztecs created some of these warrior statues in a group of five that resided in the Aztec capital. This group contained four male statues and one female statue. One bearded male warrior originally stood in the center of the group, while one male soldier stood North, East and South. The fifth sculpture, a female warrior, stood West. These warriors marked the center and four directions of the universe, and were meant to guard the sun. The Aztec Atlantean figures have the characteristics denoting a warrior. They hold spears and have clay nose bars, both indicators of military prowess. Like a Tula Atlantean figure, the typical Aztec Atlantean figure has a butterfly symbol on his chest. However, the typical Atlantean Aztec figure also has the symbol on his head. Aztec Atlantean figures are currently displayed at the National Museum of Anthropology in Mexico City.  Toltec influence  Tula, the ancient Toltec capital, collapsed in the 12th century, before the Aztecs established their city-states. The Aztec people originally migrated from Aztlan across the central highlands before they reached the valley of Mexico, where they established Tenochtitlan. During their migration, they passed through the ruins of Tula. The Aztecs regarded their predecessors, the Toltecs, as great warriors. The Toltecs defeated nearby peoples who they forced to pay tribute to Tula. The Aztecs imitated the Toltecs, forcing tribute-towns to pay maize and other goods to Tenochtitlan. Toltecayotl, which translates in Nahuatl to \\"to have a Toltec heart\\", was a term that indicated greatness, displaying the Aztecs' reverence of the Toltecs. According to Richard Townsend, > \\"[Toltecayotl] was to excel, to be worthy, to possess extraordinary > qualities in the manner of the ancients.\\" Therefore, by imitating Toltec Atlantean figures, the Aztecs associated themselves with the fearless warriors of an ancient nation regarded as great and powerful. The Atlantean figures of Tenochtitlan were not the only sculptures that showed resemblance to the sculpture of Tula. Aztec standard- bearer statues, seating figures with flagpoles, are very similar to those found in Tula. Furthermore, the Aztecs created chacmools, reclining figures used for rituals, based on those that they encountered in Tula.  Continuity or disjunction?  As Richard Townsend states, \\"the Aztecs drew on ancient artistic themes to associate themselves with the great traditions of Mesoamerican antiquary.\\" In \\"State and Cosmos in the Art of Tenochtitlan\\", Townsend explores whether Aztec sculpture maintains continuity with or diverges from sculpture of the past. Townsend states, > \\"The Mexica formed an art that would help to integrate their realm > ideologically, and that would simultaneously serve to affirm the Mexica as > legitimate successors to the great nations of the past.\\" Townsend explores the dichotomy between continuity and disjunction by comparing Aztec warrior figures to Toltec Atlantean figures. He argues the some Aztecs figures possess characteristics especially similar to those of the Atlanteans from Tula. For example, he identifies one figure whose body is more contained within a planar, monolithic space. The expression is less defined and the carved lines are less vivid. According to Townsend, this figure displays continuity. Townsend then observes another Aztec Atlantean figure that to him represents disjunction. The figure shows influence of more common Mexica style. Townsend points out greater detail, bold lines, deeper relief, and swelling of the face. By looking closely at specific Aztec Atlantean figures, Townsend proves that the Aztecs imitated Toltec Atlantean figures but also integrated their own style and traditions.  Significance  = Political = There is indication that Atlantean figures \\"express the rise of new kind of military order and associated types of behaviour \\". Between A.D. 850 and A.D. 900, archaeological evidence in the form of an increased number of emblems found throughout Mesoamerica support the idea that there was a \\"shift in leadership from the traditional one of paramount lord supported by lesser nobles (reflected in the radial stable networks and outlying elite complexes) to one that recast these supporting groups in the form of military orders\\". Mesoamerican Atlantean figures are seen to be the representation of this shift in political thinking. = Religious = Many researchers believe that the figures at Tula may represent the Toltec ruler Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl. Ce Acatl Quetzalcoatl is believed to be \\"named after the fair-skinned god worshipped by many Mesoamerica cultures\\". It is possible, therefore, that Atlantean figures in Mesoamerica also share not just political roots, but religious roots as well.  Contemporary uses  Miniature Atlantean figures are now a common souvenir item for visitors to Mesoamerican sites.

As sustainability gains support worldwide, universities across the United States have begun to take initiatives toward more sustainable campuses. Alongside student-run projects, drastic changes in administration, energy efficiency, and food and recycling have sprung up in Ivy League schools and liberal arts colleges alike. The American College & University Presidents' Climate Commitment is an evident effort to address global climate disruption consisting of a network of colleges and universities that have made institutional commitments to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions on campus, and to promote the research and educational efforts of higher education to prepare society to re-stabilize the earth's climate. Oberlin College in Ohio features the first Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Gold certified music facility, while Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, has pledged that all new buildings will meet these same Gold standards. LEED is an internationally recognized green building certification system created by the U.S. Green Building Council. This ranking system offers an incentive for building owners to implement green design, construction, efficient operations and eco-friendly solutions over the years. Buildings are responsible for about 40% of total carbon emissions. And so by including these green buildings, schools are decreasing carbon emissions, conserving water and energy and saving money each month. Princeton and Ohio University have both made strides toward cutting yearly carbon emissions on campus; While Florida Gulf Coast University has implemented solar energy throughout various buildings. A number of universities across the U.S. have created bicycle stations providing rentals to students and staff alike in an effort to reduce the burning of fossil fuels and automobile congestion as well. Car sharing like rechargeable Zipcars and reliable public transit have also helped incentivize more eco- friendly schools. These changes towards sustainability offer colleges a moral and ethical fulfillment as well as economic and financial benefits. Likewise, these universities are responsible for training future generations in sustainable practice. By offering students these more Earth friendly options, faculty and staff can ensure the well being of lands and resources for generations to come. Climate change Climate change graphs It has been evident that climate change has become a main focus in the pursuit of sustainable solutions. As more evidence grows on the significant changes in the weather patterns in the past few decades and the impacts it has on disrupting human and natural systems far more quickly than what has been predicted, actions need to be made in order to maintain efforts in eliminating greenhouse gas emissions. With the lack of help from the government in reinforcing policies to further reduce these emissions, colleges and universities have taken it upon themselves to sustain this world through efforts around their own campuses. Several programs have been implemented into action in order to keep track and encourage these institutions in committing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions ('mitigation'). The American College & University President's Climate Change Commitment (ACUPCC) is an effort to address the issue of global climate disruption promised by a network of colleges and universities that have made commitments to eliminate greenhouse gas emission from specific campus operations, \\"while promoting the research and educational efforts and to promote the research and educational efforts of higher education to equip society to re-stabilize the earth‚Äôs climate. Its mission is to accelerate progress towards climate neutrality and sustainability by empowering the higher education sector to educate students, create solutions, and provide leadership-by-example for the rest of society.\\" With nearly 673 active signatories to date, 1343 GHG inventories submitted, and 419 submitted climate action plans ‚Äì greenhouse gas emissions should no longer further to exist in the future. =University of California at Berkeley= ‚ÄúThe university has made great progress on climate action by completing an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and formalizing its commitment to reduce these emissions to 1990 levels by 2014. The campus will meet its 2014 target through a series of mitigation strategies including energy efficiency projects, installation of on-site renewables, reducing fuel usage by the campus fleet and commuters, and educational projects led by students aimed at changing behavior. So far, strategies are working. Campus greenhouse gas emissions were down by 4.5%- reaching its lowest level since 2005.‚Äùhttp://sustainability.berkeley.edu/pages/about_sustainability/overview.shtml mitigation strategies With Berkeley's efforts to take action has implemented the CalCAP program that collaborates administration, faculty, and student working to reduce gas emissions on campus by one ‚Äúconducting an annual ten- source greenhouse gas emission inventory to track progress, developing and implementing infrastructure and behavioral strategies to reduce the climate impacts of buildings and transportation, and Setting and meeting a series of emission reduction targets until climate neutrality is achieved.‚Äùhttp://sustainability.berkeley.edu/calcap/docs/2009_UCB_Climate_Action_Plan.pdf CalCAP =Clemson University= Founded in 1889 in South Carolina, Clemson University has committed to reduce greenhouse emissions by 20 percent on campus by the year 2020 from 2000 levels as part of their adopted sustainable energy policy in 2008. As part of their plan to further reduce gas emissions, Clemson has adopted a Sustainable Building Policy Plan in 2004 pledging ‚Äúall new construction and major renovations would achieve at least a Silver LEED certification from the U.S. Green Building Council.‚Äù Becoming part of the earliest adopters of this policy, their Advanced Materials Laboratory was the first LEED-certified building in the state. Already resulting in eight more successful projects either certified as LEED-silver or LEED-gold. ‚ÄúClemson will also pursue opportunities to produce carbon-free energy through three primary approaches: Determine ‚Äúbig-swing‚Äù projects to source renewable/ clean- energy at less than or equal to current prices. Evaluate other sourcing alternatives. Evaluate possible on-site power generation and/or energy storage options including: combined Heat 7 Power (CHP), including microturbines; Geothermal heat pump systems (heating & cooling); Bio-fuels; Solar thermal and photovoltaics; and Energy Storage Alternatives (batteries and thermal).‚Äù =Ohio University= Ohio University plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent from 2004 levels by 2014. Alden Library located on campus has a program to automatically shut down all computers once the library closes, having most computers already containing energy efficient LED monitors. A campus-wide efficiency upgrade beginning in April 2000 started a 10-year campus renewal project through a performance contract with the company Vestar. Completed projects through the 10-year plan include: ‚ÄúCarbon-dioxide monitors were installed in Morton and Boyd Halls,; Heat recovery and heat exchangers were installed in the Life Science Center, Installation of power factor correction capacitor bank‚Äîthe second half of the 69 kV system had new 1,340 kVAR capacitors installed to reduce KVA billing demand costs; Heat economizers were installed in Lausche Heating Plant‚Äù just to name a few. Ohio has also successfully developed the Green House Project that offers incentives of at least $500 to landlords for improving their energy efficiency in off-campus housing which has achieved annual reductions of more than 67,000 kilowatt- hours of electricity and more than 74 tons of avoided carbon emissions. =Princeton University= Turning the Tide on Climate Change This Ivy League school has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 1,990 levels by 2020. In doing so, Princeton is focusing on alternative technologies and fuels to decrease the emissions from the central power facility and the buildings it heats, cools, and electrifies which accounts for 85 percent of the Universities emissions. Another strategy the university is planning is to expand energy conservation through retrofits in existing buildings across campus, along with designing new constructions and renovations around campus to use 50% less energy than the amount required by current energy code. With a commitment to design all project with at least LEED silver equivalency. A new step in the climate change Princeton has proposed is applying an ‚Äúinternal voluntary ‚ÄúCO2 tax‚Äù when conducting financial cost-benefit analysis used to determine on whether to undertake energy efficient designs and technologies.‚Äù Allowing the university to place a monetary value on environmental impact, ‚Äúwhich in turn will increase the ‚Äúsavings‚Äù that we would achieve by undertaking the project.‚Äù Transportation has been another main focus considering it‚Äôs the second largest source for the universities campus emissions footprint. In resolving this problem Princeton has planned to replace retire campus fleet vehicles with appropriate zero or low-emission vehicles, along with encouraging walking and biking as means of commuting through incentives and enhancing bike lanes and walking paths. =Yale University= Also leading by example, Yale aims to achieve reducing a 43 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by the year 2020, with already achieving the reduction of 7 percent since 2005. ‚ÄúYale University has established a fifteen year action plan to take responsibility for its emissions and will focus on increasing efficiency of on-campus energy production and distribution, energy conservation initiatives, testing renewable energy technologies, and requiring a LEED Gold minimum standard for new construction and large renovations.‚Äù One of the most significant contributors to Yale's greenhouse gas reduction was the reduction of its Sterling Power Plant to a combined heat and power facility, known as co- generate. Powering the university's medical campus, the Sterling Plant was originally built as a coal burning steam plant but converted to ‚Äúaccommodate cleaner burning fuels over the last 88 years.‚Äù Since then the new co-generator unit of the plant has ‚Äúoperated at about 79% thermal efficiency and the boiler operates at around 90% thermal efficiency.‚Äù An estimate reduction of 15,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year, ‚Äúequivalent to the taking more than 2,600 cars off the road‚Äù due to the increase in efficiency from the plant. According to the EPA's Green Power Partnership, American University is the largest east coast school to purchase 100 percent green power and the second largest in the nation, behind University of California, Santa Cruz (57 million kilowatt hours of annual electricity usage). In the Washington, D.C., metropolitan area, Catholic University is the only other university green power purchaser (13 million kilowatt hours). Energy American universities are working towards becoming more sustainable in the face of global warming. One way that many of them tackle the problem is by using more renewable energy such as solar, wind, biomass, or geothermal energy. Many are also working on getting ‚Äògreen fees‚Äô so that they can purchase renewable energy if they do not create their own. Some universities like Middle Tennessee State University, University of North Carolina, and the Evergreen State College already have green fees in place. Other schools like the University of Florida and universities in Texas are working hard to add a green fee to their tuition so that they can improve their sustainability ratings. According to Focus.com ‚ÄúOf 149 schools which reported the use of renewable energy, a score of A- was awarded to Amherst College (MA), Arizona State University-Tempe (AZ), University of California-San Diego (CA), University of Colorado (CO), Dickinson College (PA), Harvard University (MA), Luther College (IA), Macalester College (MN), Middlebury College (VT), University of Minnesota (MN), University of New Hampshire (NH), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (NC), Oberlin College (OH), Pacific Lutheran University (WA), Pomona College (CA), Smith College (MA), Stanford University (CA), University of Washington (WA), Wesleyan University (CT), Williams College (MA), and Yale University (CT). Another 28 schools scored B+ and 7 institutions scored a mark of D on renewable energy use.\\" Two out of every five schools purchase renewable energy, either through the purchase of green power directly from their utility or through renewable energy credits equivalent to a percentage of their energy use. Nearly half of the schools produce renewable energy on campus, with solar, wind, bioenergy or geothermal systems in operation.\\"Focus.com =Wind= Wind energy is a source of renewable power which comes from air current flowing across the earth's surface. Wind turbines harvest this kinetic energy and convert it into usable power which can provide electricity for home. Many universities have invested in wind energy because it is clean, renewable, and good for the local economy. Wind energy is known for being 'clean' because it produces no pollution or greenhouse gases. Wind is a renewable energy resource, it is inexhaustible and requires no \\"fuel\\" besides the wind that blows across the earth; it is also beneficial for the local economy because the energy is harvested and produced locally. For universities this means that their energy costs are lowered while also being more sustainable. ASU School of Sustainability 3217218675 Yale Yale University, Connecticut, decided to reduce their energy beyond solar panels so in 2009 they installed ten 1-kilowatt micro wind turbines on top of the Engineering and Applied Science Center. At only 6.5 feet tall and weighing only 60 pounds, these ten turbines generate up to 26 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, reducing Yale's carbon footprint by 20,000 pounds a year. University of Vermont The University of Vermont has erected and installed a small-scale, 10-kilowatt wind turbine on its campus. It is expected to generate 3,000-5,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, enough to power an energy-efficient home for 12 months. ‚ÄúThe project is part of the Vermont Department of Public Service (DPS) Wind Development Program, which supports the installation of small-scale turbines to demonstrate the benefits of wind energy. Funding for the wind turbine was provided by a $30,000 matching grant from the DPS. The funds are a portion of $1.5 million in U.S. Department of Energy funds secured by Senator James Jeffords for wind projects.‚Äù University of Colorado‚ÄìBoulder In 2000, Students vote to purchase renewable wind-energy credits to match power used in all major campus construction after 2000, making CU-Boulder the first university in the nation to purchase wind energy. =Solar= Florida Gulf Coast University Texas A&M; University (solar panels) Solar Decathlon 2007 Florida Gulf Coast University, located in Fort Myers, Florida, has made environmental sustainability their top priority. In January 2010, the university installed a 2-megawatt solar energy system on a 16-acre field. These 10,080 solar panels will generate enough electricity to power 600 homes. FGCU formed a public- private partnership with Regenesis Power resulting in the construction of the $17 million project. Regenesis Power is a national alternative energy company headquartered in Simi Valley, California, with regional offices in Florida. The solar energy field is projected to save the institution $22 million over a 30-year period. Its impact will be felt immediately as electrical cost will be reduced from 10.5 cents per kilowatt-hour to two cents per kilowatt-hour. As a clean energy source, annually the solar energy field will prevent an estimated 9,000 pounds of nitrogen oxide, 14,000 pounds of sulfur dioxide and 5.1 million pounds of carbon dioxide from being introduced into our environment. University of Florida In 2010, the University of Florida, under President Bernie Machen, installed solar panels on the roof of Powell Hall, which is home to the Florida Museum of Natural History. The 75-kilowatt panels generate one third of the museum's electricity. University of Colorado- Boulder Solar panels installed on the University of Colorado-Boulder buildings have contributed to a 23 percent reduction in energy consumption despite a 14 percent growth in campus since 2005. =Geothermal= Ball State University Ball State University, located in Indiana, started using geothermal energy in place of 4 coal fired burners in 2009. The new system will save them an estimated $2 million a year. They are the first University to build a geothermal system of this size; 50 buildings spread over 660 acres of campus are being heated by this system. Although the project is estimated to have cost between $65 to $70 million, switching from coal to geothermal energy is estimated to be cutting down the schools green house gas emissions by 50 percent. This saves 75,000 tons of carbon from being released into the atmosphere annually. Lipscomb University Other schools are looking use geothermal for cooling efforts like The University of Lipscomb in Nashville, Tennessee. The university installed a geothermal pump in March 2005. Built in the 77,000-square-foot Ezell Center, the system of 144 wells sunk 300 feet below the softball field will keep the temperature steady year round. The geothermal pump cost the University $1.2 million but saves the university on average $90,000 dollars a year. The pump also helps the environment due to 40%-60% less energy being used compared to a standard heat pump. =Green fees= In fall 2005, 89% of voting students at Middle Tennessee State University supported an $8 per semester fee increase to purchase renewable energy and fund the installation of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies on campus. In January 2005, 91% of voting students at Evergreen State College supported a $1 per credit fee increase (up to $20.00 maximum per quarter) to purchase renewable energy and fund the installation of renewable energy and energy conservation technologies on campus. In February 2003, a renewable energy referendum passed at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, bringing around $200,000 for renewable energy projects every year beginning 2004-2005 pending approval by the UNC Board of Trustees and the UNC system Board of Governors. The University now has a $4 per semester green fee to help them buy energy from more sustainable sources and to lower their carbon impact. Students at the University of Florida, under the club I.D.E.A.S for UF are working to get a 50 cent per credit hour fee to be able to buy renewable energy for the school. UF hopes to be carbon neutral by 2025. Students under the organization I.D.E.A.S. at the University of Central Florida have also been avidly working towards passing the Green Fee in Orlando. Working hand in hand with administration, SGA and student organizations, they are working towards passing a 75 cent per credit hour fee to provide an outlet for students and staff to implement renewable energy on campus. This fee will also help to increase energy efficiencies and reach goals set out in the University's Climate Action Plan. According to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's Green Power Partnership, American University is the largest east coast school to purchase 100 percent green power and the 2nd largest in the nation, behind University of California, Santa Cruz (57 million kilowatt-hours of annual electricity usage. Recycling Recycling symbol Recycling is the process by which materials are processed and made into new products, after having been already used. Recycling reduces the use of raw materials, the creation and use of energy and pollution (air, water and land). Recycling is maintained and run through drop- offs for various materials, buy back centers, curbside collection areas, etc. All of these are done in addition to landfill waste; for instance, there may be a recycling bin next to a garbage can. Across the nation, universities are making efforts to create recycling programs that will help to create a more ‚Äúgreen‚Äù university. Almost all programs are unique, and all are working towards the goal at a fast rate. For instance, the University of Florida is working to have zero waste going into landfills by the year 2015. =Reuse programs= Repurposing a wire reel as a table Universities and colleges everywhere are creating programs for the reuse of various materials. Reuse of materials involves either reusing something for its intended purpose, or repurposing an item for any intent. For instance, having a reusable water bottle is reuse in a perfect sense. However, an old wire reel as a table (not its original purpose) is a great example of repurposing a material. This example can be seen to the left. University of Michigan The University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, Michigan, has introduced a program called ‚ÄúRecycle Write!,‚Äù an initiative for students, faculty and staff to recycle pens, pencils and markers.(http://www.recycle.umich.edu/grounds/recycle/recycle_write.php) The University Recycling Program joined forces with TerraCycle and Procurement Services to create the program. Unlike the SMART program at the University of Minnesota, Recycle Write! has no initial cost. To use the program, the university simply puts bins or boxes where they think they will get the most use with a flyer attached to them. When the bin is full, Procurement Services provides a pre-paid label to mail the contents of the box into a plant where they are re-used. However, the program doesn't just encourage the re-use of the writing utensils. For every item donated, TerraCycle donates $.02 to C.S. Mott Children's Hospital, located at the University of Michigan. Cornell University At Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, the Cornell Computer Reuse Association is sending used computers and computer lab equipment all over the world to those in need.(http://rso.cornell.edu/ccra/projects/) The club's mission is ‚Äúto donate computers and other computer-related technology to humanitarian organizations in the developing world and in the local Ithaca community.‚Äù Since its introduction in 2007, the club has sent computers to countries including Mali, Tanzania, Nigeria, Jamaica, Nicaragua, Iraq and Afghanistan among others. All of the computers and equipment are donated to the club, where they are refurbished and shipped out. The club has sent printers, scanners, projectors, monitors, laptops and computers to places such as Habitat for Humanity in Ithaca, New York, to Women's University in Iraq. Universities everywhere are doing their part to make a greener planet, from banning the sale of water bottles to donating computers around the world. =Waste management= While other universities' programs revolve around the reuse of various materials, a more common route is waste management. Waste management programs are designed to decrease the amount of materials going into landfills on a daily basis. Options for management, including recycling bins and cans are relatively easy to implement and have great success rates. University of Florida Through bins located all across campus, the University of Florida, located in Gainesville, Florida, has recycled over 200 million pounds of paper, glass, plastic, concrete, metal and other materials since the introduction of recycling at the university in 1989.(http://sustainable.ufl.edu/wp- content/docs/UFRecyclingDirective_09_01_09x.pdf) The University of Florida is also focusing on using the Three R's as part of its recycling program. Not only are bins for recycling used across campus, but also the university has implemented programs to recycle non-consumer waste. The university has employed United States Environmental Protection Agency and United States National Research Council approved methods of disposing of chemical waste for its various labs. At clinics and research labs across campus, there are also biomedical waste pick-ups. With these programs, hazardous and/or toxic materials are not going into landfills. Also, the university composts or otherwise repurposes all yard waste. Grass clippings and other trimmings are often left out as a source of nutrients for remaining landscaping. University of Minnesota The University of Minnesota has introduced the SMART (self-managed activities for recyclables and trash) program across campus to increase recycling efforts.(http://www.facm.umn.edu/about/central- services/recycling/about.uofm.recycling/quad-system/index.htm) The program is designed to take recycling to the individual ‚Äì those who create waste are those responsible for recycling it. SMART operates on ‚ÄúThe Quad System‚Äù ‚Äì instead of having trash cans under desks and near shelves, there are four trash cans at each location: one for newspaper, one for office paper, one for cans and bottles and another for trash only. Custodial workers collect from the bins once per day, instead of emptying individual trash cans from under desks. The program has taken recycling rates at the University of Minnesota from 60 to 90 percent since its introduction. Two months after the introduction of the SMART, the program published surveys for students, faculty and staff to take. Over half said that with the SMART program, they were recycling more. 86% of those polled enjoyed the SMART system. The bins cost $250,000. However, after three years, the cost of the program would be refunded because of less disposal fees and reduction in custodial wages. Through the program, university students and employees were more aware of the waste they were creating, and the campus has become more sustainable because of it. University of Oregon The University of Oregon, located in Eugene, Oregon, has a campus recycling program that has made great strides in making a cleaner campus.(http://pages.uoregon.edu/recycle/aboutus.htm) With over 1500 campus collection sites, the university is meeting both its own and the state's goals on waste management and sustainability. Every day, the group meets to tally collection sheets to monitor the waste management. They also have an annual campus waste analysis, where the group discusses how they can improve the program as a whole. In addition to recycling waste, the University is creating new re-use opportunities, another point in the three Rs (reduce, re-use and recycle). The university has been increasing the use of surplus furniture and working with vendors that are using less of and more sustainable packaging. Currently, the program is working towards having compost bins and water bottle refill spouts in all campus buildings. They are also working to have more sustainable department offices and buildings. Transportation According to the Environmental Protection Agency, transportation is the second largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, at about 29 percent. A number of American colleges and universities are working toward reducing this figure through increased bicycle use, car-sharing programs like Zipcar, public transit options like bus systems, and carpooling programs. =Bicycle use= Bicycles in front of a U.S. college dormitory Colleges and universities across the United States are increasingly encouraging students to ride bicycles to class to reduce CO2 emissions. Many of these colleges are implementing programs that provide students with incentives to do so. For example, Ripon College in Wisconsin provided free mountain bikes to every incoming freshman who signed a pledge that he or she would not bring a vehicle to campus for the entire 2010‚Äì11 school year. Colleges such as St. Lawrence University in New York and Castleton State College in Vermont have started programs that allow students and faculty to rent bicycles to ride on or near campus. These programs often include rental helmets and locks as well. The University of Washington's annual Ride in the Rain Challenge encourages students and faculty to ride a bicycle to campus every day, regardless of weather conditions. The university gives out awards for ‚ÄúMost Commute Trips‚Äù, ‚ÄúMost Rides in the Rain‚Äù, ‚ÄúMost New Riders‚Äù, and ‚ÄúMost Commute Miles.‚Äù Some universities, such as the University of California, approach sustainability from a leisure perspective. UC encourages bicycle riding by providing students with maps and directions for safe bike routes to popular destinations in the area. The college also auctions off abandoned bikes every semester to encourage bike use even more. This gives students the opportunity to purchase high quality bicycles at discounted prices. =Car sharing programs= Zipcar charging stations Car sharing programs like Zipcar have had an increasing presence on American college and university campuses in recent years. Zipcar aims to make the United States less dependent on personally-owned vehicles by providing vehicles that are available to rent by the hour. According to their website, ‚Äúevery Zipcar takes at least 15 personally-owned vehicles off the road.‚Äù Vehicles in these car-sharing programs tend to be small and fuel- efficient. Unlike typical rental car companies, car sharing companies often require participants in the program to be only 18 years old, rather than 21, thus encouraging a larger demographic of students to participate in the program. Companies have spread to university campuses across the United States. Lewis & Clark College in Oregon even provided free memberships to its Uhaul U Car Share program when it was first implemented on their campus in 2010. In April 2011, Connect by Hertz, now known as Hertz on Demand, was the very first car sharing company to bring production electric vehicles to a university or college campus. Hertz on Demand cars are Environmental Protection Agency Smartway certified, meaning that they produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions. According to their company website, they offer a variety of electric vehicles, ‚Äúproviding a zero emission mobility option for everyone.‚Äù =Public transit= Buses and other modes of public transit have been always been an important part of college campuses, but awareness of carbon emissions has caused many colleges and universities to take it more seriously in recent years. Many colleges such as Cornell University provide students with free public bus passes or allow students to use student ID cards as bus passes. Students at The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., have access to campus shuttle buses as well as two Metro subway stations. Chicago's Loyola University sets an example for public transit as well with its variety of transportation options. Students at the university have access to the Chicago Transit Authority's bus and train routes and the Red Line elevated train. Students there are granted unlimited access to these resources through the CTA U-Pass program. =Carpooling programs= Carpooling efforts on many college campuses aim to reduce the number of vehicles on the road and reduce colleges‚Äô carbon footprints. Colleges such as the University of Michigan and Florida International University utilize a web-based application called GreenRide that helps commuters coordinate carpools and vanpools rather than driving individually to campus. In addition, a number of other rideshare software programs have been created to help Americans locate potential carpooling arrangements. Many of these, such as Zimride, CommuteSmart, and RideFinders reach out to university and college students across the United States. Some colleges offer incentives such as discounted parking permits for participants in carpooling programs. Green buildings =LEED= Due to green standards set forth by the United States Green Building Council, the LEED standards were created. LEED has six main characteristics: Site Planning, Water Management, Energy Management, Material Use, Indoor Air Quality, and the Innovation & Design Process. There are currently 315 U.S. Universities with at least one LEED certified building and most Green campuses require all new buildings to be at least LEED silver. The LEED project checklist consists of sustainable sites (24 possible points), water efficiency (11 possible points), energy and atmosphere (33 possible points), materials and resources (13 possible points), indoor environmental quality (19 possible points), innovation in design (6 possible points), and regional priority (4 possible points). The point system and rankings for LEED buildings: * Certified: 40-49 Points * Silver: 50-59 Points * Gold: 60-79 Points * Platinum: 80 points and above Green buildings should primarily focus on key elements of human and environmental health. It would include sustainable site development, water savings, materials selection, and indoor environmental quality. Natural light, recycled and nontoxic materials, climate controls, and eco-friendly cost effective electricity saving resources, are used in green buildings. Additionally, many universities are educating students about green buildings by having a sustainability and the built environment minor/major. Likewise, many universities have green buildings in order to reduce carbon dioxide emissions, water use, and electricity. The three primary goals of green building are to reduce consumption, educate students, and promote sustainable practices. =Green materials= Composting Some ways to reduce consumption, educate students, and promote sustainable practices would be: * Green Roofs- a solution to the heat island effect associated with buildings. * Compact fluorescent light bulbs- use less energy and give off less heat. * Using recycled materials. * Buying and using local materials- lower transportation costs. * Low flow plumbing fixtures- waterless toilets, dual-flush toilets, and reclaimed water toilets. * Low VOC paints- limit the amount of irritating emissions. Buildings currently account for 1/6th of the world's freshwater use, 1/4th of all wood harvests, 2/5th of all material flows, and 2/5th of all energy flows. By using green buildings, consumption of resources, energy, and/or waste, could be reduced by 50-60%. Some sustainable materials used in Green Building that could reduce that percentage- fly ash, sealtech block, cold-form metal framing, ecosurfaces, reclaimed lumber, composting, waterless urinals, greenscreen PVC-free fabrics, climate upholstery fabrics, evergreen solar panels, dual-flush toilets, and PS400 flat wall form. =Universities with LEED certifications= Duke University Duke University has almost 20 buildings that have received a LEED certification and another 10 that are somewhere in the process. All new construction must also be built to LEED Silver standards. Duke's 5,600 square foot Ocean Science Teaching Center has a LEED Gold rating and it was the first Marine laboratory building that was totally green. Harvard University Harvard University has arguably the greenest buildings of any college with 26 LEED buildings and about 75 somewhere in the LEED process. Harvard also requires that all new construction be at least LEED Gold. Harvard's Pearson Laboratory has an LEED Gold rating and it boasts a 44% reduction in water consumption below EPAct standards and carbon dioxide sensors that control the outside air to vary based on occupancy and demand. University of Colorado University of Colorado has 5 LEED buildings (3 of which are Gold) and about a dozen that qualify under LEED but are not certified. All new buildings must adhere to LEED Gold standards. The Science and Engineering Building at the University of Colorado has thin-film solar panels, ice-storage system, high-efficiency windows, energy-efficient lighting, and low-chemical paints. University of Florida University of Florida has 12 LEED buildings with over two dozen somewhere in the LEED process. All new construction must be built to LEED gold standards. The James W. Heavener Football Complex at the University of Florida was the first LEED Platinum athletic building in the United States and the first Platinum rated building in Florida. The James W. Heavener Football Complex uses 100% reclaimed water for irrigation, dual flush toilets, and occupancy sensors to control and reduce lighting. University of Washington University of Washington currently has 7 LEED buildings and is planning on adding twenty more. University of Washington has also mandated that all new construction meets LEED Silver Standards. The Benjamin Hall Interdisciplinary Research Building was the 11th structure in the United States to be rated as LEED-CS Pilot Gold. Energy savings are projected to be at least $220,000 per year and the building has underground parking, energy efficient plumbing, recycled content, and refrigerating and air-conditioning systems free of ozone-depleting chemicals. Yale University Yale University also is one of the schools most dedicated to green building design with 9 projects already with LEED, several more seeking LEED, and all new buildings to be built to LEED Gold standards. The Yale University Sculpture Building and Gallery has a green roof, eight- foot operable windows, and a skin that lets in natural light.  Sustainability Among Student Groups  = Student Knowledge, Attitudes, and Behaviors = Despite the millions spent each year on sustainability initiatives on college campus, there is very little evidence that this work is going noticed by the students themselves, or that they are learning about the importance of practicing sustainable behaviors in their own lives. For example, at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire, Perrault and Clark found that about one-third of students surveyed did not know their campus had a Student Office of Sustainability, and nearly 80% did not know their own student fees were being used to pay for its $200,000 annual budget since its inception in 2011. When asked to define the term \\"sustainability,\\" students also had a fairly uni-dimensional understanding of the concept - with the majority discussing the importance of simply maintaining the status-quo. While environmental factors were noted in about one-third of responses, the social and economic factors of the sustainability triad were largely not mentioned. If we want students to participate in more sustainable behaviors, not only do colleges need to make performing sustainable behaviors easier, but there also needs to be more effective communication to help students understand the importance of performing these behaviors. One simple way could be through the incorporation of more sustainability-related content within existing college courses. For example, having students develop a detailed campaign plan for a campus sustainability partner in a strategic communication planning course led to increased attitudinal shifts toward sustainability over the course of a semester.

The EP contains three new tracks, the first one being an original song titled \\"Coffin\\", which was a left over from the group's previous album Set the World on Fire. Coffin's music video was released on June 13, 2012, to members of the BVB mailing list. It was later posted on the official Black Veil Brides website. The other two tracks are covers of the Billy Idol song \\"Rebel Yell\\" and Kiss' \\"Unholy\\", which also features Zakk Wylde playing the guitar solo. Rebels also contains a six-minute long director's cut of their music video for the song \\"Rebel Love Song\\". The cover art for the EP was painted by Richard Villa, who also painted the cover art for We Stitch These Wounds, Set the World on Fire, Wretched and Divine: The Story of the Wild Ones and Black Veil Brides IV. Track listing Critical reception Rebels received mixed to positive reviews. Reviewers took note of the return of Biersack's screams that were mostly absent from Set the World on Fire. Black Veil Brides' debut album We Stitch These Wounds had more screaming than Set the World on Fire. Rebels was put on the music service Spotify on December 2nd, 2017. \\"Coffin\\" music video The music video for \\"Coffin\\" was shot in Los Angeles, California and released on June 13, 2012. The video depicts that Andy has died, and people have come to remember him. Meanwhile, the band is playing in a dark, smoke- filled room. Later in the video, a woman tries to steal a necklace with the band's symbol on it. After she takes it, two woman overlooking the coffin vaporize all in the room, killing everyone and leaving only the necklace. Later, Andy walks into the room lays a notebook down and closes the coffin with his body inside and disappears into thin air. At the end of the video, the notebook burns for 34 seconds.

Bobby also hosted the stoner rock show Contact High on Sirius Satellite Radio's Hard Attack channel from 2004 to 2008, and hosts the podcast Blazin' With Bobby Black on Cannabis Radio.  High Times (1994-2015)  Bobby Black began his career at High Times magazine in September 1994 as a production intern in the art department while still a senior in college. After graduating, he was hired full-time and was soon promoted to Production Manager. Over the following decade, he was further promoted to Production Director then Associate Art Director, and oversaw production of nearly all of the brand's projects, including: the regular monthly magazine and offshoot magazines and special editions such as The Best of High Times quarterly editions, Hemp Times, Grow America and Medical Marijuana magazines; books, videos and calendars, and all promotional materials for the brand's events, such as the Cannabis Cup. During this time, he also began writing small articles for the magazine such as book and record reviews, and interviewing members of several prominent heavy metal bands like Type O Negative, Pantera, Sepultura, and Slayer‚Äîeventually graduating to feature length articles, and coming to the realization that writing rather than graphic design was his true calling and passion. In 2005, he officially transitioned from the art department to the editorial department when he was named Senior Editor. = Almost Infamous = In 2004, Black convinced the magazine's editors to give him a monthly column in which to tell some of the many misadventures he'd had while working at the magazine. He called it Almost Infamous‚Äîa play on the film title Almost Famous, in which an average young rock and roll fan who aspires to be a journalist ends up befriending and traveling with a famous band and ends up becoming famous in his own right. The first installment, about the time he got to meet and smoke pot with Ozzy Osbourne, ran in the final issue of Grow America magazine‚Äîall subsequent installments appeared in High Times. The column ran for 12 years, with the final installment appearing in the February 2016 issue. In the last few years, Black also released video accompaniments to many of his columns on his YouTube channel. = Doobie Awards = The High Times Doobie Awards for music (a.k.a. The Doobies) were originally created by editor Steve Bloom and held in New York City each fall. After Bloom's departure from the magazine in 2006, production of the awards show was turned over to Black, who relocated it to Austin and incorporate it into High Times' long-running annual party at the SXSW music festival (which was also founded and formerly run by Bloom). Black produced and hosted the concert/show from 2006 until High Times discontinued it in 2013. = The Cannabis Cup = For many years, Black held the honor of being the staff member who had attended the most number of Cannabis Cup events. His first Cannabis Cup was in 1994 in Amsterdam‚Äîthe first year it was fully opened to the public. Black ran judge registration at the Cup for several years, as well as serving as a member of the video crew who shot the various concerts each night at the Melkweg club, which over the years included performances by such artists as Jefferson Starship, Patti Smith, Fishbone, Steel Pulse, and Rita Marley. After High Times began hosting Cannabis Cups in the United States in 2010, Black became the event's lead reporter‚Äîhosting the video coverage of the events and interviewing numerous celebrities and sponsors. He also acted as a cannabis judge for numerous competitions, and even served as one of the Cup's two competition coordinators from 2012‚Äì2014. = Miss High Times = In 2004, Black pitched the concept of creating an ongoing contest/segment in the magazine called Miss High Times. The inspiration came from Maxim magazine's Hometown Hottie feature, as well as Penthouse Magazine's Pet of the Month/Year contest. The idea was that regular girls who loved weed would send in their photos to be featured in them magazine each month, and become finalists to eventually be chosen as the magazine's \\"smokesmodel\\" for that year. The contest was immediately popular, with thousands of young women sending in photos for consideration. In 2006, with the support of then editor-in-chief Steven Hager, the contest was turned into an actual pageant that was held in Negril, Jamaica for two years before being moved to New York and eventually being incorporated into the annual US Cannabis Cup awards in Denver each April. Black ran the contest for 10 years, until it was discontinued in 2015. = High Volume: The Stoner Rock Collection = In 2004, Black partnered with High Times Records' president Michael Esterson to produce a rock and roll compilation album entitled High Volume: The Stoner Rock Collection. The album featured original songs from some of the top artists in the stoner rock genre at the time, many of whom Black had relationships with through his coverage of the scene in High Times and his Sirius radio show Contact High. Featured artists included Clutch, Corrosion of Conformity, High on Fire, and Orange Goblin, as well as members of Monster Magnet, Kyuss and Eyehategod among others. In addition to handling all of the A&R;, Black also wrote the liner notes and designed the promotional materials and cd packaging, which featured photos of Fuse metal VJ Mistress Juliya.  On-Air Hosting  = Contact High = From 2004‚Äì2008, Black hosted a weekly music show on Sirius Satellite Radio's Hard Attack channel called Contact High. He was offered the show by program director Jose Mangin after being invited on as a guest for a 4/20 special Mangin that hosted. The show spotlighted a variety of heavy and psychedelic rock bands that fell under the umbrella term \\"stoner rock\\", as well as news about cannabis and brief highlights from some of Black's High Times articles. The show also featured occasional in-studio interviews and performances by some of the bands played on the show, including Monster Magnet, Corrosion of Conformity, Clutch, The Sword, Wino, and Seventh Void (featuring members of Type O Negative). Despite its popularity, the show was cancelled in 2008 due to the illicit nature of its cannabis theme during Sirius' merger with XM in 2008. = Blazin' With Bobby Black = Shortly after leaving High Times in November 2015, Black was approached by a representative of the Revolver Podcast network about hosting his own weekly podcast. Titled Blazin' With Bobby Black, the \\"potcast\\" first aired in January 2016 and featured interviews with numerous prominent figures in cannabis culture and entertainment, including NORML's Allen St. Pierre, former High Times editors Steven Hager and Steve Bloom, and comedians Doug Benson and Tommy Chong. In spring of 2017, after his contract with Revolver was up, Bobby transferred the show to Cannabis Radio where it remains to this day. After a year-long hiatus starting in the fall of 2017, Black began releasing some new episodes sporadically in summer 2018‚Äîincluding the 50th episode featuring award-winning actor and counterculture icon Peter Fonda.  Post-High Times  Since leaving High Times, Black has gone on to work with several other cannabis publications. In December 2016, he joined Greenleaf magazine as their West Coast editor, where each issue he penned and designed the cover feature, as well as a two-page column based on his podcast Blazin' With Bobby Black, Then in September 2017, he was tapped by Denver-based Sensi magazine to help launch their three new editions in Southern California (Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County), all three of which he edited and managed every month until leaving in May 2018 to accept the position as chief operating officer of the cannabis genetics company Crockett Family Farms. Soon after parting ways with Crockett Family Farms in June 2019, Black began working with another cannabis firm United Cannabis as a media/marketing consultant. Black also hosts the red carpet interviews at the various Cannabis Business Awards events hosted by Cloverleaf University.  Higher Way Travel  In December 2016, Bobby and his wife April Black founded Higher Way Travel‚Äîa cannabis travel agency specializing in 420-friendly vacations, destinations and events. The agency has worked with a number of popular cannabis events including the Hawaii Cannabis Expo, the Dab-A-Doo hash competition, the Cannabis Business Awards, and the Legends Valley Music Festival, as well as hosting some of their events such as the Higher Health Retreat, Surf & Terps bus tour in Hawaii, and the Baked on the Beach 4/20 celebration in Jamaica.  World of Cannabis Museum  In August 2019, Bobby was named the executive director of the new World of Cannabis Museum project. He is currently in the process of developing the new cannabis history museum which is planned to open in early 2021. In April 2020, he launched a new syndicated cannabis history blog and podcast related to the museum called Cannthropology.

Role and functions HMIP reports to the Secretary of State for Justice on the effectiveness of the arrangements for and discharge of work done on individual offenders to reduce their likelihood of offending or risk of serious harm. Historically, HMIP has inspected the work of the National Probation Service and from 2003 Youth Offending Teams, but since the Offender Management Act 2007 it has a brief to supervise more widely to reflect new arrangements by which probation services could be provided by other bodies. HMIP also works to improve the performance of probation organisations by providing a range of advice; and to provide advice on good practice to ministers, officials, managers and practitioners. Much of the work of the Inspectorate is concerned with the production of inspection reports of two sorts: inspections of individual probation providers; and thematic reports on the handling of aspects of probation work such as race equality, or drug treatment orders. The inspectorate has also published a number of reports on effective and evidence- based practice. History The Probation of Offenders Act 1907 granted the Magistrates‚Äô Courts the power to appoint probation officers. A Departmental Committee to examine to role of social services in courts of summary jurisdiction was set up in 1934. When it reported in 1936 the first HM Inspector of Probation was appointed. In earlier years the inspectorate was greatly concerned with the development of probation services in the UK, including the training of suitable staff, the organisation of probation areas, the creation of supervisory posts, and the accreditation of holders of those posts. As probation boards and areas matured, some HMIP functions such as training and accreditation were ceded to areas or other providers, and increased emphasis was put on inspection and the making of recommendations for improvement. The Inspectorate existed as a Home Office function until placed on a statutory footing by the Criminal Justice Act 1991. The Inspectorate was hosted and funded by the Home Office until 2007, when its funding and hosting was moved to the new Ministry of Justice. The role of HMIP has changed over its history to meet the needs of the time. In 2014, HMIP had a staff of around 35 inspectors and 15 support staff and a budget of circa ‚Ç§3.5M.

An English translation by Michael Hofmann was published in 2001. Attitudes Joseph Roth wrote the book for, \\"readers with respect for pain, for human greatness, and for the squalor that everywhere accompanies misery; Western Europeans who are not merely proud of their clean mattresses.\\" The book displays his \\"lifelong sympathies with simple people, the dispossessed guests on this earth and his antipathy to a selfish, materialistic, and increasingly homogeneous bourgeoisie.\\" Hoffman, p.xiv Roth is warm to his subjects, with \\"the exception of the middle-class, assimilated, denying Jews in the West.\\" Jews in Germany and France, believing themselves to be assimilated, tended to look down on the newcomers to the West. And, \\"Roth sensed that the countries of Europe, stumbling out of one war and into another, floored by inflation, willing victims of atrocious right-wing propaganda and nationalist rhetoric would not be hospitable to the Jews who were being turned out of the East.\\"Hoffman p.xv Born in Galicia, a Central European province of the Habsburg Empire, Roth witnessed the end of this Empire yet continued to call it his only homeland. He regarded it as \\"something that contained multitudes, something not exclusive\\", and, according to his English translator Michael Hoffman, the Jews represented \\"human beings in their least packaged form\\" - \\"the most anomalous, individual of peoples\\", fissured by history and geography. Roth believed in \\"Judaism, in the sense of a somewhat separate presence of Jews within and throughout and inspiriting Europe.\\" Communism he believed would eliminate anti-semitism and Jewish identity alike. He never went to Palestine, but he objected to the creation of a nation state there for the Jews. \\"The young halutz is also the disseminator of a culture. He is as much a European as he is a Jew\\". In a Preface to the 1937 edition Roth was only able to hope for \\" conditions for Jews getting steadily and bearably worse.

Queen Myeongseong (Î™ÖÏÑ±ÏôïÌõÑ) was a wise and intelligent figure, but her fierce personality was said to be the reason why her husband did not have any concubine throughout his lifetime. She became Royal Queen Dowager Hyeonryeol (ÌòÑÎ†¨ÏôïÎåÄÎπÑ) when her son, Sukjong, was crowned as the king. Queen Myeongseong frequently intervened in the court, criticizing the Southerners (Namin) and framed Grand Prince Inpyeong‚Äôs sons (Princes Bokchang, Bokseon, and Bokpyeong) with the accusation of adultery with the palace maids. The reason was that she viewed them as threats to her son‚Äôs position. However, there was no evidence to support her accusation and because of her claim, her father ended up being the suspect of initiating the slander against the princes. Queen Myeongseong took it up to herself and knelt outside her quarters, pleading for her son Sukjong to prove the princes‚Äô crime. In the end, Sukjong exiled the three princes and the Southerners mocked her as a reincarnation of Queen Munjeong because of her intervention in the politics. Her father chose to confine himself in his house following the incident as he felt humiliated and he died because of severe depression. After hearing about Sukjong‚Äôs relationship with a palace attendant (Lady Jang), Queen Myeongseong sent the attendant out of the palace since her low status would make the woman ignorant and wicked in her opinion. However, the real reason was the woman‚Äôs family background as Southerners made the queen thought that she entered the palace to become a spy for the Southerners. She set up a ceremony to pray for her son‚Äôs recovery after Sukjong felt unconscious. Queen Myeongseong was a firm believer of Shamanism and upon consulting with a shaman, decided to pray and get doused with water while wearing summer clothes although it was winter at that time. She was hit with a bad flu and died in the same year. Although the ministers urged for the shaman to be executed, Sukjong decided to exile her.

Musical career =Early days and TraceMyVeins (2004‚Äì2005)= Carson attended Billings West High School and graduated in 2005. During his time there, he joined his first band at age 14. Since then he has been in numerous bands, playing different types of music. Before Escape the Fate formed, Carson Allen had started his own post-hardcore band titled \\"TraceMyVeins\\" after leaving previous band \\"Apathy Drowns Desire\\" after releasing the EP Farewell Edgewood. The band released two songs that were to be their singles titled \\"I Wish I Knew How to Quit You\\" and \\"This Is What You Get for Helping People?\\". After realizing the band wasn't getting anywhere, Allen decided to quit to join Escape the Fate. =Escape the Fate (2005‚Äì2006)= Before forming Escape the Fate, vocalist Ronnie Radke, bassist Max Green, drummer Robert Ortiz, lead guitarist Bryan \\"Monte\\" Money, Carson Allen, and rhythm guitarist Omar Espinosa were in multiple bands together. Monte Money later created Escape the Fate, and invited Omar Espinosa, who then invited Max Green into the band. Max Green later invited Ronnie Radke and Robert Ortiz, and later recruited Carson Allen. In September 2005, the band had won a local radio contest judged by My Chemical Romance. The gig awarded them the opportunity to open a show on the band's headlining tour with Alkaline Trio and Reggie and the Full Effect, which subsequently led to Escape the Fate's record deal with Epitaph. On May 23, 2006, the band released their debut EP titled There's No Sympathy for the Dead. The EP included two songs that were later on their full-length album, Dying Is Your Latest Fashion. The EP was produced by Michael Baskette and helped earn the band attention from record labels and fans alike. Prior to the EP's recording and subsequent release, Allen left the band to join \\"Devilyn Alaska\\" and then eventually On the Last Day. =On the Last Day (2007‚Äì2009)= Before joining on the Last Day, Allen had recorded some songs with Devilyn Alaska.

On February 13, 2008, On the Last Day left their record label of Victory Records.On the Last Day then released their second EP called Make It Mean Something, which was released through Torque Records. The album charted at number 3 on the west coast Billboard Heatseekers chart. On September 2, 2009, On the Last Day announced they were no longer together and were on an \\"indefinite hiatus\\". =Me vs. Myself (2009‚Äìpresent)= After the band announced their hiatus, Me vs. Myself was started in 2009 in Seattle by singer Carson Allen, along with Jaron Johnson, Nick Wiggins and formerly Frank Gross till he left the band in 2011. The four recorded their debut EP \\"Seasons\\", which was released February 2010. After playing shows in Seattle, Me vs. Myself began playing shows along the west coast in June 2010. The following January, the band relocated to Los Angeles to work on what would be their Debut LP. On November 29 the band released another EP titled Where I Am...Where I Want to Be, tracked in Buffalo, New York, at the studio owned by The Goo Goo Dolls. The track \\"Now and Then\\" was produced by Goo's bassist Robby Takac. The band had split in 2012, playing their last show and then deleting their Facebook page with no reason given. They released a statement about the split three years later: \\\\- MVM In early 2014, the band made a new page and announced they were getting back together.

Tanner, 407 U.S. 551 (1972), was a United States Supreme Court ruling that the passing out of anti-war leaflets at the Lloyd Center in Portland, Oregon, was an infringement on property rights. This differed from Marsh v. Alabama (1946) and Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza (1968) in that Marsh had the attributes of a municipality and Logan Valley related to picketing a particular store, while the current case, the distribution of leaflets, is unrelated to any activity in the property.  Background  In 1960, the Lloyd Center, a large shopping mall near downtown Portland, Oregon, owned by the private Lloyd Corporation, had been in operation for eight years when this case commenced. Throughout this period the corporation had a general prohibition on the distribution of handbills, but it was generally open to public use. The Lloyd Corporation permitted the American Legion to sell poppies for disabled veterans, and every year before Christmas it permitted bell ringers for the Salvation Army and Volunteers of America to set up kettles and solicit contributions. However, it denied access to the March of Dimes and Hadassah, a national Zionist women's service organization. Both major parties' presidential candidates were allowed to speak in the mall's auditorium. The mall's rules were enforced by twelve commissioned special police officers of the city of Portland. These guards had full jurisdiction within the mall, carried guns, and wore uniforms just like the ones worn by the Portland police. On November 14, 1968, five young people, including the respondents in this case, distributed within the mall handbill invitations to a meeting of the \\"Resistance Community\\" to protest against the draft for the Vietnam War. The distribution was quiet and orderly, and there was no littering. A customer complained, and security guards informed the respondents that they were trespassing and would be arrested unless they stopped their distribution. The respondents left the premises as requested to avoid arrest and continued passing out handbills on the streets and sidewalks that surrounded the mall. They later brought suit in the United States District Court for the District of Oregon seeking declaratory and injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. ¬ß 1983 and 28 U.S.C. ¬ß 2201.  Public or private property  The Lloyd case resonated with the Supreme Court's 1946 Marsh v. Alabama decision, adjudicating on the public use of the private property. In that case, the court held that a company town could not exclude a Jehovah's Witness from distributing religious literature on a privately owned sidewalk. Balancing Marsh's First Amendment rights against the owner's property rights, the court, in that case, held that Marsh's rights occupied a \\"preferred position\\" and weighed heavier than the owner's rights. In other cases, the courts held that property rights were violated and people's First Amendment rights were not protected on private property. In a similar case in New Jersey, the Supreme court has upheld freedom of speech over private property rights.  Decision  The District Court found that the mall was open to the general public and equivalent to a public business district. Therefore, it held that the Lloyd Corporation's \\"rule prohibiting the distribution of handbills within the Mall violates ... First Amendment rights\\" and issued a permanent injunction restraining the corporation from interfering with these rights. The Court of Appeals held that it was bound by the lower court's factual determination as to the character of the Center, and concluded that the Supreme Court precedents Marsh v. Alabama and Amalgamated Food Employees Union v. Logan Valley Plaza compelled affirmance. The Lloyd Corporation appealed the decision to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari on the question of whether the appeals court's decision violated property rights protected by the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Justice Lewis F. Powell concluded that the respondents could have distributed their handbills on \\"any public street, on any public sidewalk, in any public park, or in any public building.\\" Therefore, respondents were not entitled to exercise their free- speech rights on the privately owned shopping-center property.  Significance  Lloyd Corp v. Tanner led to the Pruneyard Shopping Center v. Robins (1980) case, where high school students petitioned against the U.N resolution \\"Zionism is Racism.\\" The court sided with the First Amendment saying that it didn't violate the mall's rights under the U.S Constitution. However, the court reaffirmed its decision in the previous cases of Lloyd v. Tanner and National Labor Relations Board, leaving the decision up to the state's own constitution. With Richard Nixon's appointees to Supreme Court, it became more conservative than it had been in Amalgamated Food Employees Union Local 590 v. Logan Valley Plaza, where it upheld that shopping center sidewalks were equivalent to public sidewalks, allowing union works to strike and be protected under the First Amendment. The Berger court reversed many of the liberal decisions after Lloyd Corp v. Tanner. Justice Marshall said in his dissent after the case, \\"Only the wealthy may find effective communication possible unless we adhere to Marsh v. Alabama.\\" Both Justice Marshall and New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Marie L. Garibaldi noticed that the underlying truth of the matter could be undermining freedom. The New Jersey Supreme Court reaffirmed its decision that the state's constitution protected those who protested the Persian Gulf War. Writing after the case, Chief Justice Robert Wilentz wrote, \\"[N]o use is more closely associated with the old downtown than leafleting.\\"  See also  * Gunn v.

The species is known only from the middle Eocene, Lutetian stage Baltic amber found in the Blaue Erde deposits, Baltic region, Northern Europe. History and classification Diochus electrus is known only from one fossil, the holotype, number \\"KU-NHM-ENT, B-244\\". It is a single complete adult female preserved as an inclusion in a specimen of clear orange amber. The fossil was recovered from an outcrop of the Blaue Erde deposits which contain the fossil resins in the Baltic region. The type specimen is currently preserved in the Division of Entomology at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum located in Lawrence, Kansas, USA. Diochus electrus was first studied by Stylianos Chatzimanolis of the University of Tennessee at Chattanooga and Michael S. Engel of the University of Kansas. Their 2011 type description for the new species was published online and in print in the journal ZooKeys. The etymology of the specific name electrus is a derivation of the Latin word \\"electrum\\" meaning amber. When Diochus electrus was described, it was the first definitive species of the rove beetle subfamily Staphylininae to be described from the fossil record. The Baltic amber species Bembicidiodes inaequicollis, described by L. W. Schaufuss in 1888, was formerly considered part of Staphylininae. However reevaluation of the species in 2001 by L.H. Herman raised doubts about the correct subfamily placement for B. inaequicollis. Diochus electrus is one of eleven species of the genus Diochus inhabiting the Palearctic realm. Description The Diochus electrus type specimen is a well preserved fully complete female with a total body length of . The head is ovoid in shape and has fine sculpturing with sporadic punctations. The antenna do not have a geniculate structure, which indicates placement of the species into the tribe Diochini. Though similar to the genus Coomania, the neck of D. electrus is more robust, with Coomania having a neck that is approximately a fifth the width of the head. The elytra of D. electrus are in length and have a width of . They are longer than the pronotum. The other ten palearctic species of Diochus possess pronotum which are longer than the elytra, distinguishing D. electrus as a species.

It was built in 1876 in the Victorian Stick/Eastlake style as a summer home for the McDonald family, whose primary residence was in San Francisco. After the death of the senior McDonalds, the eldest son Mark Jr. and his wife Isabelle eventually became sole owners of Mableton, and made it their primary residence. By the early 1920‚Äôs, the two began to extensively remodel Mableton to suit their own tastes. In 1959 Mabelton's exterior was used in the filming of Walt Disney's Pollyanna. However, film editors altered the look of the McDonald house by using matte painting to add several stories to make the building taller, as well as architectural features. In 1977, during a restoration process, a fire destroyed a large part of the house. The owner, Dr. Jack Leissring, rebuilt the house. He sold it in 2005 to technology entrepreneur John Webley and his wife Jennifer. As of 2018, they remain the owners of the house. In 2006, the Rynerson O'Brien Architecture firm began a five-year renovation of the home. The overhaul included restoring the exterior, recreating Victorian theme rooms throughout the home, and adding new features to the backyard.

Although people possess differing viewpoints and diversity of views is a central tenet, commonly held themes seek an equal playing field in the economy with more equal opportunities for all people as well as accountability for corporate and financial malfeasance. Many of those in the movement argue that structural, systemic change is necessary and that incremental reform is insufficient and in any case not possible without popular countervailing power to the power of moneyed interests. Occupy St. Louis is in solidarity with the Occupy Wall Street movement. It is located at Kiener Plaza in downtown St. Louis near an area which includes many financial institutions such as commercial banks and the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. As of June 2012, Occupy St. Louis had continued to engage in organized meetings, events and actions. Overview Occupy St. Louis consists of concerned citizens and individuals from many different ideologies and backgrounds whom wish to address economic and political issues. It uses consensus decision-making and is a horizontal organization utilizing facilitators in lieu of leaders and has no official spokesperson. The encampment has consisted of more than fifty tents with a couple hundred continuous occupiers and many hundreds more activists. Several families occupied the space long term. The demographics consist of people from a large racial, gender, and political mix, many people of various ages and class backgrounds, laborers, professionals, large numbers of both employed and unemployed, the underemployed, military veterans, students and teachers, some homeless, as well as those of diverse sexual orientations. People have joined from some distance around the region in addition to the city and metropolitan areas. With the exceptions of views promoting violence or hatred, Occupy St. Louis is open to all political beliefs with Democrats, Republicans, independents, Greens, liberals, progressives, conservatives, libertarians, socialists, anarchists, communists, and the previously nonpolitical, among others, represented among those in the movement. Actions held by Occupy St. Louis include the occupation of Kiener Plaza, civil disobedience, demonstrations, protest marches, and picketing. OccupySTL has acted in solidarity with at least two strike actions and walkouts and has been supported by various trade unions and many individual unionists from the region. OccupySTL is participating in moving money from large commercial retail banks (in particular, Bank of America) to local credit unions or community oriented banks. It participated in Bank Transfer Day on November 5, 2011. It has called boycotts, supported buy local campaigns, organized mic checks and flash mobs at area stores on Black Friday, and participated in food drives. It cosponsored a \\"Green Friday\\" festival with barter trading, a fair trade market, arts and crafts workshops, live music, and roundtable discussions as a sustainable alternative to Black Friday.Green Friday - A Sustainable Alternative to Black Friday OccupySTL has also supported and directly assisted a number of families unfairly foreclosed upon. A large rally and march in alliance with area unions held on October 14 attracted around 1000 people. OccupySTL participated in a rally and march as part of the November 17 Day of Action across the United States and world. This was in conjunction with the Occupy movement as well as local unions, MoveOn.org, and PROMO, among other organizations participating but not necessarily intercoordinating. Approximately 1,000 people marched from Kiener Plaza to the Martin Luther King Bridge, passing by various financial institutions and the regional Federal Reserve Bank before 14 were arrested for blocking traffic on one onramp of the bridge to highlight neglect of infrastructure and jobs. Banners were also unveiled on area overpasses. There are educational efforts such as daily teach-ins from a variety of organizations. A food tent was established to feed occupiers (as well as some of the city homeless). An on- site library of pamphlets, periodicals, and books has also operated. An interfaith was established by two chaplains, creating a space for interfaith worship, discussion, and fellowship. Incidents and arrests Occupy St. Louis initially faced a small number of citations and arrests for violation of the curfew at Kiener Plaza, a city park. Thereafter until November 11, however, the response from the St. Louis Police Department and Mayor Francis G. Slay was relatively less repressive than that of many other cities and there were no large scale arrests, raids, or police violence. The mayor eventually blogged and city officials indicated to the media a list of violations, which was challenged by OccupySTL, as well as an ultimatum that occupiers vacate the plaza after curfew and remove all tents. Coinciding with a nationwide crackdown coordinated by the FBI, in collusion with large financial companiesHow the FBI coordinated the crackdown on Occup , after 11 pm on Veterans Day, the St. Louis police faced a crowd of about 400 to raid the plaza, arresting approximately 27, and confiscating (with the city parks department) the materials of occupiers left on site. Although there was no rough treatment of people by the police, some of these materials were thrown into garbage trucks and crushed despite explicit assurances that all items would be bagged and tagged for later retrieval by owners. OccupySTL marched in solidarity with the Veterans Day march earlier in the day but its activists challenged pervasive neglect of veterans. Since the Veterans Days eviction, Kiener Plaza has been continuously patrolled by park rangers and the city police who have strictly enforced the ban on tents and the 10 pm-6 am curfew (the latter was not enforced previously and remained unenforced at other parks). A preliminary injunction filed pro bono on behalf of Occupy St. Louis to cease enforcement of the curfew by arguing violations of First Amendment speech rights was denied in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. During mid-March 2015, St. Louis hosted the Occupy the Midwest Conference. On March 15, police without provocation violently arrested occupiers as they were using a crosswalk after exiting Compton Hill Reservoir Park, causing many to be bloodied and permanent injuries on some, including permanent dislocation of one person's jaw. Several protesters were beaten and pepper sprayed, as were news media and documentary camerapeople.Occupy protesters say arrests at park were unprovoked On May 24, police violently arrested protesters in an anti-police brutality march held in response to the March incident in St. Louis and to the mass and violent arrests at the 2012 NATO Summit in Chicago on May 20. Several protesters were charged with felonies but all of those charged were acquitted of all charges. One protester, who was beaten in interrogation at a police station and against whom evidence was fabricated, settled a lawsuit for $100,000.Occupy Protester Beaten by St. Louis Police Earns $100K Settlement See also Occupy articles * List of global Occupy protest locations * Occupy movement * Timeline of Occupy Wall Street * We are the 99% Other Protests * 15 October 2011 global protests * 1877 Saint Louis general strike * 2011 United States public employee protests * 2011 Wisconsin protests * Ferguson unrest * 2017 St. Louis protests Related articles * Arab Spring * Corruption Perceptions Index * Economic inequality * Corporatism * Corporatocracy * Direct action * Grassroots movement * Income inequality in the United States * Lobbying * Plutocracy * Precariat * Tea party protests * Wealth inequality in the United States References External links * Diaspora* * Livestream * Anti-State STL * OccupySTL Blog (unofficial) * St. Louis Activist Hub blog Category:2011 in Missouri Category:Occupy movement in the United States Category:2010s in St. Louis Category:Culture of St. Louis Category:Organizations based in St. Louis Category:Political organizations based in St. Louis Category:Protests in Missouri ","title":"Occupy St. Louis"},{"id":"33631676","text":"Department of Justice v. Landano, 508 U.S. 165 (1993), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the Government is not entitled to a presumption that a source is confidential within the meaning of Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act whenever the source provides information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation in the course of a criminal investigation.United States Dep't of Justice v. Landano, .  Background  =Murder of Officer Snow= On August 13, 1976, during a robbery by two gunmen of the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service in Kearny, New Jersey, one of the gunman killed Newark police officer John Snow.Matthew J. Salzman, Exemption 7(d) of the Freedom of Information Act - the Evidentiary Showing the Government Must Make to Establish a Source is Confidential, United States Department of Justice v. Landano, 113 S. Ct. 2014 84 1041, 1050 (1993). A Hudson County Grand Jury indicted Allen Roller, Victor Forni, Bruce Reen, and Vincent James Landano for felony murder and armed robbery, along with other offenses.State v. Landano, 637 A.2d 1270, 1271 (N.J. Super. Ct. L. Div. 1994). The trials of Forni and Reen were severed from the trial of Roller and Landano. Roller entered into a plea deal with the Hudson County Prosecutor and gave damaging testimony against Landano during the trial. The state believed that Roller and Forni planned the robbery, but that only Landano and Roller actually participated in the crime.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1272. An unindicted co-conspirator, David Lee Clyburn, testified that Roller and Forni planned the robbery, and that they planned to \\"take care of\\" a police officer who usually delivered large amounts of cash. Clyburn stated that he withdrew from the plan as he did not want to kill a police officer, and was concerned that as the only black, the others would turn on him. Roller's testimony was different from Clyburn's. Roller stated that while planning the robbery, Forni offered to recruit \\"Jimmy\\" and that later Landano agreed to participate. Roller stated that Forni drove Landano and him to a parking lot, where they stole a car, and then Landano and Roller went to the site of the robbery. Roller testified that after waiting they then robbed the Hi-Way Check Cashing Service. A customer, Colin McCormick identified Roller, but was unable to reliably identify Landano, stating that he never saw his face.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1273. The owner, Jacob Roth, and his son, Jonathan, also testified. Jacob stated that when the business was being robbed, he activated the silent alarm and \\"hit the deck\\", never looking up as the robbers took the cash. He tentatively identified Landano, saying that he \\"resembled\\" one of the robbers. Jonathan also identified Landano with uncertainty, noting that he only saw the robber for a second or two. John De Maritz, another customer, testified that Roller was the individual that entered the business and that he heard shots from outside.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1273-74. Another man, Joseph Pascuitti, also testified against Landano. Pascuitti was the only one to witness the killing of Officer Snow, from his job adjacent to Hi-Way Check Cashing. Pascuitti stated that the shooter came towards the police car and shot Officer Snow without warning from two to three feet away. Prior to the trial, Pascuitti selected Forni's photograph as being the shooter, but that he was not certain.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1274. Physical evidence found in the stolen car included a bloodstained jacket or vest, two pair of gloves, a blue hat, $60 in coins, a shell casing, and a partially filled coffee container. The blood type on the jacket matched that of Officer Snow, and was a relatively rare type. Two handguns were found in the river. Roller identified one of those as belonging to him, and the other as having been used by Landano. That handgun was registered to Forni. At the trial, Landano tried on the jacket, but it did not fit.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1275. Landano testified in his own defense, and denied participating in the robbery. This was corroborated by his fianc√© and her friend. In addition, Landano entered evidence that at 6:00 A.M., he was at a Staten Island methadone clinic and could not have made it back in time to help steal the car at 6:35 A.M. Evidence showed that a motorcycle gang called \\"the Breed\\" planned the robbery, and that Landano was recruited for the crime.Salzman, at 1050. In May 1977, Landano was convicted on all counts and sentenced to imprisonment for life plus fifteen years., 29-30 (1992). =Appeals= In June 1977, Landano filed an appeal. In October 1978, Landano obtained a court order for the consideration of a motion for a new trial based on newly discovered evidence. Judge Maurice A. Walsh, Jr. found the knowledge of evidence of prior robberies by Roller and Forni could have been important in the trial and that the knowledge of such evidence had been suppressed. If this knowledge had been revealed, Judge Walsh stated, then it \\"would have been probative in demonstrating, if Roller denied Forni's participation [in those robberies], that Roller was protecting Forni.\\" However, the court decided that the suppression of this evidence did not violate Brady v. Maryland. because the evidence wasn't \\"material,\\" meaning that the evidence would not have changed the trial's outcome.Landano, 637 A.2d at 1276. After various petitions from Landano and various hearings, a federal judge released Landano from prison in 1989 after Landano served 13 years of his life sentence on the grounds that the prosecution had systematically withheld evidence. On March 12, 1992, a New Jersey Court of Appeals ordered an evidentiary hearing to consider claims stemming from documents that two people, including a witness at the trial, failed to identify a photo of Landano, the police department's report that a witness identified Victor Forni as the driver of the getaway car and not Landano, and the failure to submit this information to Landano and his defense team before the trial began. The New Jersey Court of Appeals also ordered the hearing to investigate any impact that any potentially lost or damaged materials could have had on the trial. After the evidentiary hearing discovered that evidence was withheld at the trial, Landano believed that the Court's ruling in Brady v. Maryland (373 U.S. 83) was violated when the prosecution in his murder trial withheld \\"material exculpatory evidence\\" (i.e. evidence extremely important for the defendant's case) during his trial. Landano filed FOIA requests with the FBI who had compiled evidence related to Landano's murder trial because, under the FOIA, anyone can request documents from any government agency to be released for whatever reason. However the FBI withheld some documents and redacted other documents without giving any reasons for doing so. Believing that this violated the FOIA, Landano brought his case to the Federal District Court in order to get the requested documents released. The FBI claimed that its withholding and redacting of documents was completely legal due to Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act. Exemption 7(D) states that the government can withhold information if \\"records or information compiled for law enforcement purposes could reasonably be expected to disclose the identity of a confidential source --including a State, local, or foreign agency or authority or any private institution which furnished information on a confidential basis.\\" The Federal District Court stated that the FBI had to give a legitimate reason for the withholding of information given by anyone other than a regular law enforcement agency informant. The Court of Appeals agreed and rejected the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed whenever an individual provides information to the FBI during a criminal investigation. The Court of Appeals also rejected the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed based on an investigation's subject matter. Instead, the Court of Appeals held that the FBI had to provide a detailed explanation for each and every confidentiality claim it makes on a case-by-case basis instead of using a general guideline for what qualifies as confidential as it had done in response to Landano's requests. Another Court of Appeals also rejected the FBI's claim that the documents were confidential in terms of Exemption 7(D). However, this second court stated that the FBI's claim to confidentiality for the purposes of Exemption 7(D) had backing from a number of previous court decisions. This Court of Appeals considered itself bound by a previous court's decision in Lame v. United States Department of Justice 654 F.2d 917 (CA3 1981) and decided that the FBI could not presume confidentiality on the terms of the investigation's subject matter or on the fact that an informant is giving information to the FBI for a criminal case, but rather the FBI had to provide \\"detailed explanations related to each alleged confidential source\\" The Supreme Court decided to grant a writ of certiorari in order \\"to resolve the conflict among the Courts of Appeals over the nature of the FBI's evidentiary burden under Exemption 7(D).\\" = Historical context = The FBI had a long history of releasing and then redacting various records and claiming that this was completely legal according to exemption sections in the FOIA Sometimes, these redactions interfered with court cases and research. According to Athan Theoharis, an American historian who wanted to research FBI files, the FBI \\"so heavily redacted the released records as to preclude needed research.\\" About two-thirds of the files Theoharis asked for in relation to his research were withheld from him. This gives an example of the extent to which the FBI used the exemptions in the Freedom of Information Act. The FBI was notorious for such redactions and withholdings, and many believed that it interfered with justice being carried out. With the advent of Landano's case before the Supreme Court, the FBI's excessive use of the exemptions in the FOIA were finally being questioned. = Arguments = Vincent James Landano argued that the evidence he requested should not have been withheld according to Exemption 7(D) because the FBI might have been obliged to reveal the names of sources according to Brady v. Maryland. Landano also believed that a source is considered \\"confidential\\" (for purposes of Exemption 7(D)) only if the source can be completely assured, either explicitly through the actually stating of such assurance or implicitly (implied) that the source's cooperation with the FBI will not be disclosed to anyone.Department of Justice v. Landano \\"Landano argues..will be disclosed to no one\\" The FBI, however, argued that \\"confidentiality\\" in terms to Exemption 7(D) can be presumed based on either an investigation's subject matter or the simple fact that an informant is giving information to the FBI.  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court ruled unanimously in favor of Vincent James Landano. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor delivered the opinion of the Court. O'Connor rejected the FBI's argument that confidentiality can be presumed based on the fact that an informant is giving information to the FBI. Justice O'Connor also rejected most forms of categorical presumptions of confidentiality that the FBI often used, such as automatic confidentiality for the purposes of Exemption 7(D) for all documents that are collected for a criminal investigation (which is one of the categorical presumptions the FBI used in this specific case). Justice O'Connor sarcastically stated that, under the way the FBI declared the confidentiality of documents, the FBI would expect that every single one of its documents can be withheld or redacted and that it can use Exemption 7(D) for all of its documents. O'Connor did, however, state that the Court accepts certain forms of categorical presumptions of confidentiality. But these categorical presumptions are a lot more narrowly defined than what the FBI had previously used. Justice O'Connor gave the scenario of a paid informant as an example of an accepted categorical presumption of confidentiality. She stated that a paid informant can expect that his/her cooperation with the FBI will be kept secret, and that this makes documents related to a paid informant subject to being withheld or redacted in accordance with Exemption 7(D). She also stated that, in murder cases like this one, informants may also expect to have their interactions with the FBI be confidential. Justice O'Connor said that the Court would accept the FBI's presumption of the confidentiality of any documents related to an informant for a murder case. Finally, O'Connor rejected the FBI's argument that all its sources must be confidential in order to maintain effective law enforcement. The presumption of confidentiality that the FBI makes of presuming that a source and documents related to a source are confidential simply based on the fact that a source gave information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation was also rejected by Justice O'Connor. She stated that any source related to any type of criminal case the FBI handles should not be considered confidential simply because information was given for a criminal case. While she believed that murder cases would warrant an accurate presumption of confidentiality, she opposed the view that the FBI can presume confidentiality for every type of criminal case it deals with. The Court concluded by stating that, when the nature of the crime investigated and when a source's relation to the crime lead to a safe inference of confidentiality, confidentiality can be presumed. This is a much more narrow approach to what can be defined as confidential in terms of Exemption 7(D) than the FBI's approach. The Supreme Court thus rejected the decisions of the courts of appeal and declared them inaccurate. The Court remanded the case back to a court of appeals, ordering such a court to rule according to the new guidelines the Supreme Court had just laid out in its decision. Subsequent developments This case was the first time the Supreme Court dealt with Exemption 7(D) of the Freedom of Information Act and the United States government's use of it. The United States Department of Justice now uses more rigorous standards in determining what can be withheld under Exemption 7(D) and now uses more detailed and case-specific proofs for why a document cannot be released to the public. Even at the administrative level, Landano decision must be and is followed. Vincent James Landano received the documents he requested in accordance with the Supreme Court's decision. In 1994, a court of appeals voided Landano's murder conviction and returned the case to Hudson County, New Jersey for a retrial. Landano was acquitted of murder in the retrial in 1998. He died on November 11, 2002 at the age of 63 at a hospital in Toms River, New Jersey.

He is currently the Goll-Ohio Eminent Scholar and Professor of Molecular Biology in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Ohio University Heritage College of Osteopathic Medicine. Dr. Kopchick's groundbreaking work in the field of growth hormone has helped shape the study of endocrinology.  Early life  John Joseph Kopchick was born in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania on November 2, 1950 to Peter Kopchick and Kathryn Gabster Kopchick. He spent the first four years of his life in a small coal mining town: Ernest, Pennsylvania. He then moved to Indiana, Pennsylvania with his parents and youngest brother, Bill, where he attended Indiana High School. There, he varsity lettered in baseball, was in the national honor society, and played trumpet in the school band and orchestra. John later attended The Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where he met his wife, Charlene Kopchick. They were married on June 26, 1976. Education and career Dr. Kopchick received his B.S. in biology in 1972 from the Indiana University of Pennsylvania (IUP). While attending IUP, he was a founding brother of a social fraternity Chi Alpha Sigma, which is now a chapter of Delta Tau Delta. In 1975, he received his M.S. in biology and chemistry from IUP. The title of his M.S. thesis was ‚ÄòCatabolism of alpha-amino adipate by Pseudomonas putida p2‚Äô. He went on to attend the University of Texas, MD Anderson Hospital, Houston, Texas and received his Ph.D. in 1980. His dissertation described the biosynthesis of Rauscher murine leukemia virus reverse transcriptase. From 1980 to 1982, he continued his research training as a postdoctoral fellow at the Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley, New Jersey. He then accepted a position at the prestigious Merck Institute of Therapeutic Research where he conducted and facilitated research from 1982 to 1986, first as a senior research biochemist and later as a research fellow, and finally as a group leader of Molecular Biology at the Department of Animal Drug Discovery. During that time, he developed a system built around cloning and expression of growth hormone (GH) genes. In 1987, Dr. Kopchick started as Director of the Growth, Diabetes and Obesity section at the nascent Edison Biotechnology Institute (EBI) of Ohio University in Athens, Ohio. During his time at EBI, he discovered and characterized the molecular aspects of GH receptor antagonists. This discovery was further developed into the drug, Somavert[ (Pegvisomant for Injection). It has been approved for use in the USA, Europe, and Japan along with 12 other countries for acromegaly, a chronic disease caused by excessive GH secretion. Another notable accomplishment of the Kopchick laboratory is the generation and characterization of the world‚Äôs longest lived laboratory mouse, the growth hormone receptor knockout mouse.

When Anderson's appointment was announced at a Sunday morning worship service, approximately fifty families quit their membership, some of them walking out during the announcement. Bowers remembered that moment as a pivotal turn in the history of St. Patrick's because \\"new people began to pour into our church (St. Patrick's) with a different view of what church should be and our life together was changed forever.\\"Remembrances of Thomas D.

Leadership The Parish is led by the Vestry, an elected group of lay leaders, who elect a Rector, a member of the Episcopal clergy, to chair the Vestry, serve as the spiritual leader of the congregation, and manage the day-to-day operations of the Parish's ministries. Every year, the Parish selects leaders to serve as Senior and Junior Wardens and representatives of the Vestry at an annual meeting in early November (the meeting must be held in November prior to the 15th of the month). The Vestry is transitioning to a body of twelve lay members and the Rector for a total of at least 13 members and no more than 15. This transition is a result of bylaw amendments that passed at a vote of the Parish on September 18, 2011. The lay officers of the Vestry are Senior Warden, Junior Warden for the Church, Junior Warden for the Day School, Treasurer, and Clerk who serve one-year terms. Three vestry representatives are elected every year to serve two-year terms.St. Patrick's Parish Bylaws, pg. 5-6 The current Rector is the Rev.

It ran from Neumark in the Vogtland district of Saxony to Greiz in Thuringia, but was closed in 1999. History As early as 1839, manufacturers in Greiz had sought a connection to the then projected Saxon-Bavarian Railway (Leipzig‚ÄìHof railway). Ultimately, this line was built entirely on Saxon territory, although an alignment through the Elster valley would have made the major bridges (the G√∂ltzsch and Elster Viaducts) in Vogtland unnecessary. Saxony also had no interest in a subsequent railway in the Elster valley, because it did not want any competition with its own lines. In 1855, an Eisenbahn- Bauverein (railway building association) was established in Greiz to build a rail connection to the Saxon-Bavarian Railway. A treaty between the Principality of Reuss Elder Line and the Kingdom of Saxony was signed on 3 November 1863 as the basis for its construction. On 30 June 1864, the Greiz- Brunn Railway Company () was formed. =Construction= On 17 September 1864, construction began on the line. The starting point of the new line was Neumark station and initially the line ran along the tracks of the Saxon-Bavarian Railway. The line branched off from the main line to the newly built Brunn station in order to continue through the Aubach valley to Greiz-Aubachtal station, which was the end of the line. The line was built fairly quickly, so that the line was completed in October 1865. On 21 October 1865 the line was opened with a procession; regular train services were recorded on 23 October 1865. On 1 January 1876, the Greiz-Brunn Railway Company was nationalised and the Neumark‚ÄìGreiz line became part of the Royal Saxon State Railways. Immediately thereafter, construction began on a short connecting line to the Elster Valley Railway. A 200 metre long tunnel was excavated immediately west of Greiz-Aubachtal station in order to connect with the Elster Valley Railway running from the south into Greiz station. On 15 October 1879, the two kilometre long rail link was put into operation. The last development of the line was the building of a separate track between Neumark and Brunn, which was opened on 19 May 1886. In 1924, the line was officially reclassified from a main line to a branch line. =Decline= After the political changes in 1989/1990 the number of passengers on the line continued to fall. Passenger services were finally close at the timetable change on 31 May 1997, freight operations were discontinued at the end of 1995. The line was formally closed on 28 February 1999. A little later, the connection between the tracks of the Saxon-Franconian trunk line and the Neumark-Greiz line were removed.

Visvesvaraya Retrieved on 14 October 2016 was an Indian civil engineer and statesman and the 19th Diwan of Mysore, serving from 1912 to 1919. He received India's highest honour, the Bharat Ratna, in 1955. He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the British Indian Empire (KCIE) by King George V for his contributions to the public good. His birthday, 15 September, is celebrated as Engineers' Day in India, Sri Lanka and Tanzania in his memory. He was the Chief Engineer of Krishna Raja Sagara dam in the north-west suburb of Mysuru city, and also served as one of the Chief Engineers of the flood protection system for the city of Hyderabad.  Biography  Visvesvaraya was born to Mokshagundam Srinivasa, a Sanskrit scholar and teacher and Venkatalakshamma, a homemaker. He took a job as an assistant engineer with the Public Works Department of Bombay, and later was invited to join the Indian Irrigation Commission. He implemented an intricate system of irrigation in the Deccan Plateau, and designed and patented a system of automatic water floodgates,that were first installed in 1903 at Khadakvasla Reservoir near Pune. These gates raised the storage level in the reservoir to the highest level likely to be attained without causing damage to the dam. Based on the success of these gates, the same system was installed at Tigra Dam in Gwalior and Krishna Raja Sagara (KRS) Dam in Mandya/Mysore, Karnataka. In 1906‚Äì1907, the Government of India sent him to Aden to study water supply and drainage systems. The project prepared by him was implemented in Aden successfully. Visvesvaraya achieved celebrity status when he designed a flood protection system for city of Hyderabad. He was instrumental in developing a system to protect Visakhapatnam port from sea erosion. This dam created the biggest reservoir in Asia when it was built.Husain, Dildar (1966) An Engineering Wizard of India,Institution of Engineers(India);AP,Hyderabad. Visvesvaraya gave his technical advice for the location of Mokama Bridge over Ganga in Bihar. At the time, he was over 90 years old, and was called the \\"Father of Modern Mysore State\\". During his service with the Government of Mysore state, he was responsible (under the patronage of the Mysore government) for the founding of Mysore Soap Factory, Parasitoid Laboratory, Mysore Iron & Steel Works (now known as Viswesvarayya Iron and Steel Limited) in Bhadravathi, Sri Jayachamarajendra Polytechnic Bangalore, Bangalore Agricultural University, the State Bank of Mysore, Century Club, Mysore Chamber of Commerce (Federation of Karnataka Chambers of Commerce & Industry), the Apex Chamber of Commerce in Karnataka, University Visvesvaraya College of Engineering (Bangalore) and numerous other industrial places. He encouraged private investment in industry during his tenure as Diwan of Mysore. He was instrumental in charting out a plan for road construction between Tirumala and Tirupati.Sree Venkateswara Ghat Rd, Tirupati,AP He was known for his sincerity, time management and dedication to his cause. The Bangalore Press and the Bank of Mysore were established during his tenure. A very important part of his nature was his love for Kannada. He set up Kannada Parishat for the improvement of Kannada. He wanted seminars for Kannada supporters to be instituted and conducted in Kannada itself. Visvesvaraya is known to have designed and planned an entire area of Jayanagar in South Bangalore. The foundation of Jayanagar was laid in 1959. It was one of the first planned neighbourhoods in Bangalore and, at the time, the largest in Asia. It is believed that the locality, designed by Visvesvaraya, has one of best-planned layouts in Asia. = Career timeline = * Assistant Engineer in Bombay, 1885; served in Nasik, Khandesh (mainly in Dhule) and Pune * Services lent to Municipality of Sukkur, Sind, 1894; designed and carried out water works for the municipality * Executive Engineer, Surat, 1896 * Assistant Superintending Engineer, Pune,1897‚Äì1899; visited China and Japan, 1898 * Executive Engineer for Irrigation, Pune, 1899 * Sanitary Engineer, Bombay, and member, Sanitary Board, 1901; gave evidence before Indian Irrigation Commission * Designed and constructed automatic gates patented by him at Lake Fife Storage Reservoir; introduced new system of irrigation known as \\"Block System\\", 1903; represented the Bombay Government at Simla Irrigation Commission, 1904; on special duty, 1905 * Superintending Engineer, 1907; visited Egypt, Canada, United States, and Russia, 1908 * Consulting Engineer to Hyderabad/Nizam State, supervised and carried out engineering works on Musi river; Hyderabad floods of 1909 * Retired from British Service, 1909 * Chief Engineer and Secretary to Government of Mysore, 1909 * Diwan of Mysore, Public Works Department and Railway, 1913 * Board of Directors of Tata Steel, 1927‚Äì1955  Diwan of Mysore  Visvesvaraya on a 1960 stamp of India After opting for voluntary retirement in 1908, he took a foreign tour to study industrialized nations.

History  The Ouray Electric Light and Power Company was incorporated on December 6, 1885. It is one of the 4 oldest operating power plants in the world. The first electric plant was built at the south end of Oak Street, but the plant was moved and enlarged in 1890 near its present location. Water was used from the Uncompahgre River, when available. A steam engine was used to provide service when the flow was low or freezing conditions occurred. On February 20, 1886, the power company petitioned the Board of Trustees for a 20-year contract to erect poles, wires, and lamps throughout the city. Water was originally provided from a tunnel driven into Box Canyon with water diverted from Canyon Creek, but the water proved to have too much sand and abrasives in it. In 1901 it was announced that a dam was to be completed the following year on the Ucompahgre river south of Ouray to furnish a more consistent supply for the hydroelectric plant. That dam is still in use today. Water from that dam also supplies water for the Ouray Ice Park, a premier ice climbing venue that extends for 3 miles south of Ouray and attracts thousands of climbers each year. When the new dam was proposed it was described as follows: \\"The dam will be from 60 to 90 feet high and in the neighborhood of 300 feet wide. It will cross Bear Creek Valley [Uncompahgre Valley] and blockage of the waters of the stream will be about one mile and a quarter this side of Bear Creek Falls and when completed that back water will form a beautiful mountain lake, clear as crystal, one mile and a half wide by a mile and a quarter in length. \\"The fall from the dam is 700 feet... It will be one of the most gigantic undertakings in the story of the San Juan, and every minute detail has be fully considered and there is no doubt about it being carried to a successful issue.\\" The Western Colorado Power Company (WCPC) was organized on March 12, 1913. By the following year it had consolidated the operations of eight major companies: the Durango Gas and Electric Company, San Juan Water and Power Company, Nunn's Telluride Power Company, the Telluride Electric Light Company, and (in 1914) the Ouray Power and Light Company, Montrose Electric Light and Power Company, Delta Electric Light Company, and Ridgway Electric Company. The new Western Colorado Power Company encompassed thirty predecessor companies, which had an average corporate life of only six years. Networking of the formerly isolated power plants was a daring concept, never before attempted on this scale. It involved construction of transmission lines through the steep mountains and construction of additional power generation sources. One result was a sharp decrease in the costs of electrical service. Eric R. Jacobson, current owner of the Ouray power plant, provided much of the above information about how the collection came to Fort Lewis College. He has informed the Center of Southwest Studies that he has in his own possession about the same volume of records as is at the Center. Many of his records focus on the Ouray plant. Jacobson notes that Deep Springs College in Bishop, California, has records of L. L. Nunn; Paul Swatek of Chicago is on that College's board of directors and is perhaps the best contact regarding those records. Other records are available at the Olin Library of Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. 220px Eric Jacobson purchased the power plant in April, 1992, from the Colorado-Ute Electric Association, a utility that was in bankruptcy and unable to make the needed repairs. He purchased the plant for $10 because he was the only pre-qualified bidder. Jacobson restored the dam, replaced pipe, and modernized the power house. In the spring of 1994 the power plant was able to once again produce electricity. Public Service Company of Colorado contracted to sell the power which is wheeled to Denver to be used in the grid. Richard Ezra Fowler was the operator of the Ouray Hydro plant and resided there from 1992 until 2008. He was helped by Chris Dobbins who took over plant operations after Mr. Fowler's untimely death.  Hydrowest  The hydroelectric plant is owned by Hydrowest, Inc., . As part of the modernization of the Ouray Hydroelectric plant, custom- designed offsite monitoring and alarm systems have been added.

His wife and Mrs Mault, also the wife of a missionary, began to teach lace-making and embroidery to local girls. While in Neyyoor, the Abbs's had three children: John Henry (born 1838), Amelia (born 1841) and Louisa (born 1842). In 1845 Abbs was transferred to Pareychaley, South Travancore, where a bungalow had been erected for Abbs to found his own mission. Here he continued to labour and educate local inhabitants in various subjects, including literacy, health and religion. His mission became the headquarters for the mission district. The village and district prospered, and the mission became one of the largest in the world, with over 10,000 native Christians under the charge of one European missionary.Charles Sylvester: The Story of the L.

Abbs Memorial Church His wife taught local girls at the boarding school subjects that included religion, history, geography and some elements of natural philosophy. She continued the work she had done in Neyyoor and began an embroidery industry in the district. The workers were paid a reasonable wage and the surplus was used mostly for building up institutions intended for women. While in Pareychaley the Abbses had two more children: Selina, born in 1847, and Charles, born in 1849. In 1850 Louisa briefly went to England with her children, leaving them there at missionary schools and with family members. She then returned to her husband in Travancore and remained until 1859, when they returned to Norwich. The success of Abbs's mission can be seen today: the district contains some 100 congregations and an Abbs Memorial Church in Parassala built in his honour.

His early artwork depicted political statements, such as the Vietnam War and the Civil Rights Movement. His current work includes portraits of celebrities and historical figures. His work is held in the collection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Brooklyn Museum of Art, National Gallery of Modern Art, among others.  Early life  Lee Waisler was born on February 25, 1938 in the Hollywood neighborhood of Los Angeles, California to a politically progressive Jewish family. Growing up in nearby West Hollywood, Waisler was surrounded by the movie business and those aspiring to be in it, which, Waisler says, came to be an important part of his development. Waisler attended the Hollywood Academy of Arts from the age of seven. At the time Waisler was growing up, the Abstract expressionism movement was gaining popularity. Waisler became interested in abstraction and was influenced by artists like Mark Rothko and Clyfford Still.  Early work  Waisler's first solo show took place at the Ryder Gallery in Los Angeles in 1968. Waisler exhibited a series of figurative color etching. Much of the work Waisler produced in his early career was socially and politically charged, relating to the Holocaust, civil rights, the Vietnam War, and the anti-nuclear cause.  Public works  In 1981, responding to a critic's negative review of his anti-nuclear work, Waisler dumped 5 tons of horse manure at the entrance to the LA Times. The dump truck that deposited the manure had a sign reading \\"A critic's choice.\\" The dump symbolized Waisler's frustration over the control art critics had over artists and the causes to which they directed their work. Waisler received international media coverage with mixed reception from artists and political sources. In spite of rejections, Waisler continued anti-nuclear and anti-war works in painting, sculpture, and public works. Later that year, Waisler began the project entitled \\"Target LA\\" to spread anti-nuclear awareness. Using stencils to spray paint a stop-sign-within-a- target logo across the Los Angeles area, Waisler invited the public to a culminating event at the L.A. city hall for the presentation of another public work called \\"Bomb Cage.\\" The sculpture consists of 8 World War II-era bomb shells encased within an octagonal wooden structure. The sculpture is presented covered by a black parachute. When the parachute is withdrawn, hundreds of black balloons escape from inside the sculpture. The balloons represent the nuclear fallout of a bomb exploding at that location. The sculpture was presented as a gift to the city of Los Angeles, but was rejected. It was later sent to Hamburg, Germany and installed at the headquarters of the \\"Greens\\" political party. Continuing his anti-nuclear public works, in 1985 Waisler constructed \\"Under the Mushroom\\", a 5-story tall, 50-foot wide black mushroom-cloud inflatable as a movable sculpture. The work is first exhibited in Amsterdam where the artist invited the crowd to assist in deflation by trampling the sculpture as a symbol of nuclear disarmament. The sculpture went on to be exhibited approximately 30 times internationally with public participation at each showing.  Paintings  Waisler's paintings deal with a variety of social, political, and symbolic themes. His interest in the abstract expressionists that came to popularity during his youth (particularly Mark Rothko) influenced his work greatly. Waisler's early paintings were much more formal and ethereal, eventually moving on to integrating human figures into monumental, minimal, and architectural forms. From there, Waisler began to experiment with non- traditional materials: first wood, then sand, earth, and silicone carbonate. Waisler also uses recurring imagery and colors as symbols to develop a dialogue between paintings and events, such as his Holocaust memorials. Waisler uses a variety of materials, both in paintings and sculpture, that double as representative symbols. Wood, a recurring element in Waisler's paintings, symbolizes life and shelter. Sand is used to represent time, various forms of Earth to represent power, and various forms of carbon to represent life. Waisler has also used ash and stone in his Holocaust memorials. The materials serve both symbolic and formal purposes. Waisler often layers multiple materials with paint to create high-impasto surfaces on his works, adding to other formal properties. Additionally, Waisler uses light-reflective materials and paints to explore the symbolism of light with the belief that life is transferred by light.  New Delhi  In 1996 Waisler was invited to exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in New Delhi. In 1998, Waisler spent 4 months in India producing the work for the exhibition. In order to avoid the effect of a colonial installation, Waisler produced all the work in India so as to reflect Indian culture and philosophy in both theme and materials. A central theme of the works from this period was Mandala imagery and the meditative response that it evokes. Waisler also produced an anti- colonialist sculpture called \\"IMF Lifesaver\\", a large life-saver shape made of barbed wire. The Mandala symbol continued as a recurring theme in Waisler paintings after the exhibition.  Current work  In the early 2000s, Waisler began to paint portraits of people which has continued to the present day. Some figures painted include Albert Einstein, Nelson Mandela, Mahatma Gandhi, Rosa Parks, Paul Celan, Virginia Woolf, Aung San Suu Kyi, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Ethel Rosenberg. Waisler also continues to produce other figurative and abstract works and sculptures and exhibit worldwide. Further reading *Malik, Keshav. Waisler & Malik.

Its most extreme form was death by burning. History From the 8th to the 15th centuries, much of Spain was controlled by Muslims, where Jews and Christians were given dhimmi status. This meant that they were required to pay a special tax, the jizya, for ‚Äúprotection‚Äù, intended, as Islamic legal texts indicated, to remind them of their submission. The tax was imposed on the \\"people of the Book\\", as Jews and Christians were known, to humble them.. While at times, those who were Jewish could rise to important positions in the political structure, instances of anti-Jewish sentiment erupted, such as the 1066 Granada massacre in which much of the Jewish population of Granada were killed by a Muslim mob.Granada by Richard Gottheil, Meyer Kayserling, Jewish Encyclopedia. 1906 ed.1971 Jewish EncyclopediaSolomon ibn Verga, Shevet Yehudah, ed. A. Shochat (1947), p. 22. The treatment of religious minorities varied depending on the era. For example, during their time of ascendance, the Almohads assumed the title of caliph, introduced a series of severe religious measures, and sought to strengthen their states through religious unification, which means compelling the Jews and Christians to either convert to Islam or be expelled.Encyclopedia Britannica  URL: https://www.britannica.com/place/Spain/The-Almoravids Around the 11th century, growing suspicions of Jews prompted Christians to unite against the Muslims and Jews. From that point, Spain became a political soup of different powers and territories, each with their own policies regarding the status of Jews and Muslims. Eventually the Christians won out and by the 13th century, they ruled all of Spain except a few territories to the south that were still occupied by Muslims. Ferdinand III of Castile boasted himself as the king of three religions. This tolerant pride, however, did not last long. In the 14th century, Dominican and Franciscan priests called on Christians to expel the Jews from Spain. They would go from town to town in the countryside and convince Spaniards that the root of their plight lies with the abuse and villainy of the Jewish population. These bands of subjects would destroy synagogues, burn Jews alive, and spared nobody unless they converted. Jews would be forced to attend sermons and have Christian preachers outline what the Christians viewed as the errors of their ways. From there, Spain's favor shifted completely to their Christian subjects and policy began to negatively affect the Jews. New laws segregated the Jewish population and limited the occupations that were still open to them, with the ultimate goal of conversion. The pressure was so much that more than 100,000 Jews converted. Once converted, these New Christians joined the \\"conversos\\" class, who were afforded the legal and social privileges of a full Christian in society. Many New Christians took advantage of their elevation in status and embraced Christian privileges rather than ignored them. After a few generations, the converted Jews identified as nothing more or less than \\"regular\\" Christians. It seemed as though Spain had achieved what it wanted; they had a uniform Christian majority within their kingdom. This uniformity, however, brought with it new versions of anxiety and fear concerning the conversos. With the entire corpus of anti-Jewish legislation no longer applicable, ‚ÄúThe mistrust of the Jew as an outsider gave way to an even more alarming fear of the converso as an insider.‚Äù Up until the Jews converted, the differences between religious classes were very clear. Laws and customs aimed at guaranteeing Christian \\"superiority\\" in Spain afforded Christian subjects the comfort of knowing there was uniform hatred among Christians for the Jewish people. They could identify Jews in society and ostracize them while continuing to feel safe among their own people. Once the Jews converted, however, there were no longer clear divisions between what Christians regarded as the \\"morally upstanding\\" Christians and the \\"villainous\\" Jews. Many Christian Spaniards believed that they no longer knew whom they could trust and who could possibly be a treacherous heretic at heart. In an attempt to assuage these fears, Limpieza de sangre (Purity of Blood) laws were put in place that traced the bloodline of Christians New and Old to see if they had Jewish ancestry. In doing so, Spain divided its Christian class along ethnic and religious lines, \\"othering\\" those with Jewish blood much as they had prior to conversion. The prejudice behind this method of vetting was that conversos had Jewish blood in their veins and therefore, from the Christians' perspective, they likely held many of the same stereotypical faults of the Jewish people. Influential Christians believed that there was something different in the essence and soul of the person that could not be cured by religious conversion. With these laws came the resurgence of accusations of blood libel, devil worship, and other perceived crimes against the New Christians. On 1 November 1478, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile received permission from Pope Sixtus IV to name inquisitors throughout their domains in order to protect Catholicism as the one true Christian faith. It originally applied to the Crown of Castile‚Äîthe domain of Isabella‚Äîbut in 1483 Ferdinand extended it to his domain of the Crown of Aragon. Autos-da-f√© became quite popular throughout the Spanish realm, competing with bullfights for the public's attention and attended by royalty. Though Ferdinand's action met with occasional resistance and resulted in the assassination of the inquisitor Pedro de Arbu√©s by converted Jews in 1485, between 1487 and 1505 the processing and trying of more than 1,000 heretics was recorded by the Barcelona chapter, of whom only 25 were ultimately absolved.¬´La Inquisici√≥¬ª , Hist√≤ries de Catalunya, TV3, s.d. An auto-da-f√© in Seville, illustration from 1870 Once granted permission from the Pope to conduct inquisitions, the monarchs began establishing permanent trials and developing bureaucracies to carry out investigations in most of the cities and communities in their empire. The first Iberian auto-da- f√© took place in Seville in 1481: the six accused were found guilty and executed.Cullen Murphy, God's Jury: The Inquisition and the Making of the Modern World, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2012, pp. 65-69; Later, Franciscan missionaries brought the Inquisition to the New World. The exact number of people executed by the Inquisition is not known. Juan Antonio Llorente, the ex-secretary of the Holy Office, gave the following numbers for the Inquisition excluding the American colonies, Sicily and Sardinia: 31,912 burnt, 17,696 burned in effigy, and 291,450 reconciled de vehementi (i.e., following an act of penance). Later in the nineteenth century, Jos√© Amador de los R√≠os gave even higher numbers, stating that between the years 1484 and 1525 alone, 28,540 were burned in person, 16,520 burned in effigy and 303,847 penanced. However, after extensive examinations of archival records, modern scholars provide lower estimates, indicating that fewer than 10,000 were actually executed during the whole history of the Spanish Inquisition,Dedieu, p. 85; Perez, pp. 170‚Äì173. perhaps around 3,000.Monter, p. 53. The Portuguese Inquisition was established in 1536 and lasted officially until 1821. Its influence was much weakened by the late 18th century under the government of the Marqu√™s de Pombal. Autos-da-f√© also took place in Goa, New Spain, the State of Brazil, and the Viceroyalty of Peru. Contemporary historians of the Conquistadors, such as Bernal D√≠az del Castillo, recorded them. Although records are incomplete, one historian estimates that about 50 people were executed by the Mexican Inquisition.Jose Rogelio Alvarez, ed. \\"Inquisicion\\" (in Spanish). Enciclopedia de Mexico. VII (2000 ed.). Mexico City: Sabeca International Investment Corp..  Process  1683 painting by Francisco Rizi depicting the auto-da-f√© held in Plaza Mayor, Madrid in 1680. The auto-da-f√© was a major aspect of the tribunals, and the final step in the Inquisition process. It involved a Catholic Mass, prayer, a public procession of those found guilty, and a reading of their sentences.Peters, Edward. Inquisition. New York: The Free Press, 1988. An Inquisition usually began with the public proclamation of a grace period of 40 days. Anyone who was guilty or knew of someone who was guilty was urged to confess. If the accused were charged, they were presumed guilty. Officials could apply torture during the trial. Inquisitors were required to hear and record all testimony. Proceedings were to be kept secret, and the identity of witnesses was not known to the accused. After the trial, officials proclaimed the prisoner's sentence and administered it in an auto-da-f√©. The auto-da-f√© was not an impromptu event, but thoroughly orchestrated. Preparations began a month in advance and only occurred when the inquisition authorities believed there were enough prisoners in a given community or city. The ritual took place in public squares or esplanades and lasted several hours with ecclesiastical and civil authorities in attendance.Many of the public autos-da-f√© were described in contemporary published works listing the dignitaries in attendance, the condemned and their sentences. See, for example, Matias de Bocanegra, Auto general de la f√©..., Mexico: 1649 Bordering the city's plaza, an all-night vigil would be held with prayers, ending in Mass at daybreak and a breakfast feast prepared for all who joined in. The ceremony of public penitence then began with a procession of prisoners, who bore elaborate visual symbols on their garments and bodies. These symbols were called sanbenito, and were made of yellow sackcloth. They served to identify the specific acts of treason of the accused, whose identities were kept secret until the very last moment. In addition, the prisoners usually had no idea what the outcome of their trial had been or their sentencing. The prisoners were taken outside the city walls to a place called the quemadero or burning place. There the sentences were read. Prisoners who were acquitted or whose sentence was suspended would fall on their knees in thanksgiving, but the condemned would be punished. Artistic representations of the auto-da-f√© usually depict physical punishment such as whipping, torture, and burning at the stake. The auto-da-f√© was also a form of penitence for the public viewers, because they too were engaging in a process of reconciliation and by being involved were given the chance to confront their sins and be forgiven by the Church. In popular culture Condemned by the Inquisition wearing a sambenito carrying the cross of St. Andrew (Francisco de Goya). The auto-da-f√©, usually represented as a heretic being burned at the stake, is a symbol used widely in the arts, especially in Europe. *Voltaire featured an auto-da-f√© held by the people of Lisbon after the 1755 Lisbon earthquake in chapter six of his satire Candide (1759). The university of Coimbra decides that this \\"great ceremony was an infallible means of preventing the earth from quaking.\\" *Edgar Allan Poe ‚Äì In \\"The Pit and the Pendulum\\", Poe uses the auto-da-f√© as a reference point for the narrator as he tries to determine what is happening to him. *Giuseppe Verdi ‚Äì In his 1866 opera Don Carlos, Verdi includes a pivotal scene in the third act that depicts the beginning of an auto-da-f√© in front of the Cathedral of Valladolid in Spain where heretics are about to be burned at the stake. *Herman Melville ‚Äì In Moby-Dick, near the end of Chapter 54, mentions auto-da- f√© in passing: Though there are no Auto-da-Fe's in Lima now,' said one of the company to another; 'I fear our sailor friend runs the risk of the archiepiscopacy. Let us withdraw more out of the moonlight. I see no need of this. In \\"The Confidence-Man: His Masquerade\\" (1857), set on a Mississippi steamboat filled with colorful characters and the Devil himself as the con- man, Melville weaves an allegory on how easily one may win over a person's, or for that matter, an entire people's confidence. The story begins and ends with the appearance of mysterious young men, the latter of whom is described as wearing tattered red and yellow clothes reminiscent of ‚Äúa victim in auto-da- fe.‚Äù The book opens with the words \\"Dedicated to victims of Auto da Fe.\\" *Leonard Bernstein composed and produced a musical adaptation of Voltaire's Candide in 1956, featuring a song called Auto-da-F√© that includes the chorus, \\"It's a lovely day for drinking and for watching people fry,\\" referring to the spectacle of public executions. *Elias Canetti won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1981 for his work, especially his novel Die Blendung (1935), literally \\"The Blinding,\\" translated into English as Auto-da-F√© (1946). *Fyodor Dostoevsky begins a chapter of The Brothers Karamazov with a \\"splendid Auto-da-F√©\\". The chapter is famously called \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\". *In Thornton Wilder's 1927 novel The Bridge of San Luis Rey, a central character, the friar Brother Juniper, is burned for heresy in an auto-da-f√© in early 18th-century Peru. Although the novel is fictional, autos-de-f√© did occur in Lima, Peru at least as late as 1733. *Tennessee Williams wrote a one-act play entitled Auto-da-F√© (1938). *Roger Zelazny wrote a short story, Auto-da-F√©, which appeared in Dangerous Visions, 1967. *In Dai Sijie's Balzac and the Little Chinese Seamstress, the final climactic book burning is repeatedly referred to as auto-da-f√©. *Man of La Mancha, 1965 musical with a book by Dale Wasserman. It tells the story of the \\"mad\\" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the Spanish Inquisition. *Richard Zimler describes the humiliation and torments of his narrator and an imprisoned Jain in an auto-da-f√© in his novel Guardian of the Dawn, which is set in the Portuguese colony of Goa at the beginning of the 17th century. *Monty Python The comedy troupe Monty Python has a famous parody of the Spanish Inquisition, with the famous, \\"no-one expects the Spanish Inquisition!\\" from Michael Palin *Jos√© Saramago goes into detail about an Auto-da-f√© in Baltasar and Blimunda (1982). *Mel Brooks's cult comedy History of the World, Part I (1981) makes reference to the auto-da-f√© in its segment about the Spanish Inquisition. *The West Wing episode \\"7A Wf 83429\\", the first episode of the fifth season, when referring to a meeting where the Democratic leaders are going to punish them for invoking the 25th, Josh says \\"Anyone else coming to the auto da fe?\\" *SPK titled their 1983 compilation album Auto Da Fe. *In Matthew Lewis's Gothic novel The Monk (1796), madrile√±o monk Ambrosio barely escapes burning in an auto-da-f√©. Convicted of rape and murder (which also turns out to be incest and matricide) he is sentenced to death by burning at the stake. He is rescued last-minute by the intervention of Lucifer only to be left on a precipice in the Sierra Morena mountains. After falling down, insects drink his blood and mountain eagles \\"tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eye-balls with their crooked beaks\\" before he perishes. *The 2016 film Assassin's Creed depicts an auto-da- f√© in 1492 Spain. The sequence involves a parading of the accused and the outcomes of the sentencing. A Spectacle in Antisemitism With a variety of motivations, the Spanish crown wanted to take action that would unite the entire country, with a campaign against the Conversos (converted Jews) offering a convenient target. The autos-da-f√© were instrumental in the \\"re- othering\\" of the Jews. The campaign perpetuated old stereotypes about Jews. Moreover, by eventually expelling all non-Catholics, Spain was attempting to create a homogenous society, or \\"One crown under one religion,\\" contrasting with a more tolerant past that had accommodated Christianity, Judaism and Islam. Once the Jews converted and became a part of the conversos class, the crown realized that one of the best tools for unity is a common enemy. In vilifying the New Christian, the crown sought support for its own political agenda. They pushed for the \\"cleansing\\" of Spain and the rebirth of what they hoped would be a strong, singular Catholic state. By positioning the crown as the religious and political engine behind the Inquisition, Spain's position on the Jews was cemented. It was an antisemitic state and all those who lived within its borders were supposed to share those same sentiments. Decades after the initial call for conversion of all Jews in 1492, Spain continued to use the Autos as a unifier of thought. This time, they were attempting to appeal to a crowd that had no personal experience with the conversos class exercising new rights. To them, many of the heretics and Judaizers were people accused of \\"crimes\\" who had been Christians for generations. The victims had few, if any, ties to their old Jewish heritage except blood. Making the autos more of a spectacle created a resurgence in antisemitic feelings for a population that had no personal experience with outwardly presenting Jews in society. The accusations and trials were done on the basis of suspicion and anxiety. Nonetheless, it reinforced a cultural aversion to the Jewish identity. These spectacular productions also sensationalized the rooting out of heresy, making the Jews seem extremely dangerous. For around 2 centuries, Spain's main mission was promoting national identity and removing heresy from their land. By including important dignitaries, special costumes, and bloody torture and execution, the crown was able to turn the Jew into a legendary foe. Likewise, its very violence and spectacle made the work that the Inquisition did seem of the utmost importance to societal preservation. At a time when people felt the corruption of their immortal souls was at stake, removing any perceived danger to the purity of the Christian religion would have been of the utmost importance. Unfortunately, this unity came at the price of the Jewish people. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Arouet, Francois-Marie (Voltaire) (1758). Candide * Dedieu, Jean-Pierre (1987) L'Inquisition.

Calhoun and Floride Calhoun, and the wife of Thomas Green Clemson, the founder of Clemson University. Early life Calhoun was born on the Bath plantation, in the Abbeville District of South Carolina, in February 1817. She was one of seven children. She adored her father, politician John C. Calhoun, and remained close to him until his death in 1850. Her early education was through her surroundings and family, at a day school in Edgefield, South Carolina, then later at South Carolina Female Collegiate Institute, in central South Carolina. Calhoun stayed at the South Carolina Female Collegiate Institute for about a year before she returned to her family's home at Fort Hill. When she returned, Calhoun taught her younger brothers how to read and write. Marriage and children In 1835, Calhoun moved to Washington, D.C., to be a copyist for her father, with the notion that she would never marry. In early spring 1838, Calhoun met Thomas Green Clemson. The couple married on November 13, 1838, in Fort Hill, South Carolina. Clemson's job called him to Washington and the newlyweds moved to Philadelphia. The couple would have three children: a son, John Calhoun (born 1841) and Floride Elizabeth (born 1842). A third child, daughter Cornelia (known as ‚ÄúNina‚Äù) was born in 1855. She died in infancy. Shortly after the birth of their first two children, Clemson accepted a position in Belgium. The Clemson family moved over-seas for the time. As Clemson became a high-ranking diplomat to the Kingdom of Belgium, Calhoun quickly became homesick and wished to return to her father. She had never been separated from him for an extended period of time. Calhoun had a unique fascination with her father. Before her marriage to Clemson, Calhoun said to a house maid, ‚ÄúYou who know my idolatry, for my father, can sympathize with my feelings.‚Äù (Aug. 2, 1838) The Clemson family remained overseas from 1844‚Äì1852 and returned home to buy one hundred acres in Maryland, four miles from Washington, DC. The couple named their new home in Maryland \\"The Home‚Äù. Civil War years After their return to the United States, Clemson served in the Civil War, leaving Calhoun to care for the children and the farm. Calhoun's mother still lived alone in Pendleton, South Carolina, during the Civil War. During this time, Calhoun needed to travel back and forth from \\"The Home\\" to her mother, meaning she was crossing hostile lines. Calhoun and Floride packed several possessions and temporarily moved into a five-room home outside of Beltsville, Maryland, which was near Baltimore. Although she was closer to her mother, Calhoun was concerned about the Clemson family's possessions that remained in her family's estate. Calhoun and Floride decided to pack up their remaining possessions and to mail them to relatives, hoping that their items would make it through the war. Calhoun never received trouble from either the North or the South while crossing borderlines to see her mother, until 1865 when she moved back to Pendleton. Later years and death In 1871, Thomas Clemson retired and he and Calhoun moved to Fort Hill, South Carolina. That same year, both of the couple's children died within 17 days of one another. Daughter Floride, who has married Gideon Lee Jr., the son of politician Gideon Lee, died on July 28, 1871, after a long illness. Son John died of injuries he suffered from a train wreck on August 10 at the age of 29. On September 22, 1875, Calhoun died of a heart attack at Fort Hill. She was buried with her family in the Saint Philips Episcopal Church Cemetery in Pendleton, South Carolina. Legacy In the years preceding Anna Calhoun Clemson's death, she and her husband discussed starting an agricultural college in upstate South Carolina. They decided that the college would be situated in Fort Hill and that John C. Calhoun's house would remain on the land. The house still stands at the center of Clemson University's campus. Anna's largest effort to help start the college before her death was the creation of a committee to gather support around the state. One of the main points of the committee was to spread the word that the college was to be built in the legacy of her father, John C. Calhoun, who did much for the state of South Carolina. In honor of his wife, Thomas Green Clemson founded Clemson Agricultural College 1889 and opened in July 1893, with a student body of 446 men.

In 2003 the Encyclopedia of Distributed Learning cited Kennedy-Western University as an example of an unaccredited, profit-making online university that had \\"achieved reported economic success.\\"Encyclopedia of Distributed Learning, by Dr. Kjell Erik Rudestam, SAGE Publications, , November 6, 2003 Over the university's history, it had offices in, Hawaii, Idaho, and finally to Wyoming, while keeping headquarters in California until December 2007.

The article quoted Lady Branham, deputy to the association's executive director, as saying: \\"Accreditation generally involves an intensive review, including inspection visits by teams from the accrediting agency. After today's deadline to apply for accreditation, the law gives schools five years to achieve it. With North Central, that's a tight schedule. Just being accepted as an accreditation candidate with North Central is a process in itself. They could be candidates within four to five years. It's unlikely that it would be sooner. And then accreditation is usually four years after candidacy begins. And it's not automatic.

The most common game of footbag consists of two or more players standing in a circle and trying to keep the sack off the ground for as long as possible. History Footbag-like activities have existed for many years. The game is similar to traditional Asian games of kicking the shuttlecock, known as jianzi or chapteh. The game is also similar to some South East Asian games, such as sepak takraw and sipa. This game is known as jegichagi (Ï†úÍ∏∞Ï∞®Í∏∞) in Korea. The Wu Style Tai Chi Chuan practice dates back to at least the 1930s, and policemen are seen playing a shuttlecock game in the 1955 American movie To Catch a Thief. The same principle is applied in football-playing countries in activities of freestyle football and keepie uppie. The current Western incarnation of the sport was invented in 1972 by Mike Marshall and John Stalberger of Oregon City, Oregon, with their \\"Hacky Sack\\" product, the rights to which are now owned by Wham-O. Although Marshall suffered a blood clot and fatal heart attack in 1975, Stalberger continued the business.Footbag Worldwide FAQ It gained national popularity in the early 1980s, and Stalberger sold the title to Wham-O in 1983. The game of hacky-sack remained popular throughout the mid-1990s among the hippy, stoner and grunge crowds, but experienced a falling-out with the turn of the century. Hacky-sack was a popular game played during free-periods at schools around the world in the 1990s and early 2000s. Equipment A crocheted footbag For circle kicking, it is very common to use a crocheted footbag, which is usually filled with plastic beads. Casually, footbags are often differentiated as normal (indicating a plastic-pellet filling), or as \\"dirt bags\\" or \\"sand hacks\\" (indicating a sand filling). In the freestyle footbag discipline, a 32-panel bag is the generally accepted standard (the number of panels on commercially available bags can range from 2 to 120 panels). Stitchers generally use Plastic Poly Pellets, sand, BB's, steel shot, lead shot, seed bead, or tungsten shot as filler. Most professional stitchers use a custom combination of different fillers to make the bag play better. Bags usually weigh between 40 and 65 grams, depending on the type of filler and amount of filler used. 32-panel bags do not stall as easily as a \\"dirt bag\\" or \\"sand hack,\\" but set truer from the foot, allowing for more complex tricks. Professional footbags are usually made out of the fabrics ultrasuede light, facile, or (a sub-brand of Clarino artificial leatherAbout amaretta). While these bags can last a long time with proper care, they are quite fragile relative to their more common crocheted cousins. The footbag net discipline uses a distinct bag, characterized by a harder outer surface than other footbags. These bags are not suitable for freestyle, and vice versa. There are also several novelty products available, including glow in the dark, chain mail, and even flame retardant bags that can be set on fire and played with. The fire footbag has been banned in South Australia. = Shoes = A popular variation of Footbag Lacing, as used by some footbag freestyle players Most advanced freestylers wear various styles and brands of tennis shoes, the most popular being the Adidas Rod Laver tennis shoe. Several shoe modifications are common in freestyle footbag. In order to make toe stalling easier, many players use special lacing patterns that pull apart the sides of the shoe near the toe area, creating a broad, rimmed platform. Modified lacing is augmented by cutting away the stitching that joins the row of eyelets to the toe. The area that is created by completing these modifications is called a toe box. Shoes can be further modified for freestyle footbag by removing layers of fabric from the inside, outside, and toe surfaces. These modifications are advantageous because they allow players to more accurately feel the bag on their foot. Games =Circle kicking= Video of four players circle kicking Circle kicking is the most common game played with a footbag, and is often what people mean when they use the term \\"hacky sack\\". Players stand in a circle and keep the bag moving around the circle, with the goal of keeping the bag from touching the ground. There are a variety of terms used by different groups of players to note when the footbag has been touched by every member of the circle. The game starts when one player picks up the sack and tosses it to the chest of another player, who allows it to fall to their feet so they can kick it, and play begins. Play continues until the sack falls to the ground, then a player picks up the sack and the game resumes. The object of the game is to keep the sack off the ground for as long as possible. If every player gets a touch to the sack before it hits the ground, it is called a 'hack'. If every player gets two touches before the sack hits the ground, it is called a 'double-hack' and so on and so forth. Circle kick is generally accompanied by an unwritten set of etiquette guidelines designed to keep the game fun, friendly, and open to everyone including new players. The most basic rule is to respect all other players. Some other general guidelines include picking up the footbag after you drop it or kick it away, rather than having someone else retrieve it; not serving the footbag to yourself; not spitting in the circle; and not hogging the footbag (often called jestering, or the player may be called a hack-hog) and making sure to pass the bag to players who have not gotten it recently. Most circles are very open to new players and will not ostracize anyone for being less coordinated or well practiced than the rest. Some circles have an unwritten rule that there is no apologizing when a person drops the footbag. This guideline is designed to keep the new players from feeling as if it is their fault that the game is slow, and it keeps the experienced players from having to constantly reassure the new players that it is not their fault. Variations on circle kicking are numerous and spontaneously created. =Freestyle footbag= World champion 2011, 2012, 2013 & 2020 Jan Weber performing a freestyle move Freestyle footbag is a sport in which the object is to perform tricks with the bag. The ending position of the footbag on one trick becomes the starting position of the footbag on the next trick. Tricks are created by combining different components between contacts with the bag (contacts can be either stalls or kicks, though stalls are more frequent). Components include spins, dexterities (using a leg to circle or cross the footbag's path in mid-air), jumps, and ducks (letting the footbag pass a few inches above the neck). Contacts are usually on the inside of the foot behind the opposite support leg (Clipper Stall) or on the toe, however, many inventive possibilities remain and are used to create an endless list of tricks. A partial list of freestyle footbag tricks can be found at the official Footbag WorldWide Information Service. Various styles have developed as the sport has become more popular. Players can choreograph routines to music, alone or in pairs, executing difficult moves in sync with the music‚Äîthe result is something like a cross between rhythmic gymnastics and figure skating. There is an annual footbag world championships held each year. The current freestyle world champion in singles category is Jan Weber, of Czech Republic. =Footbag net= In footbag net, players (either playing individually or with a partner) volley a footbag back and forth over a five- foot-high net. This game combines elements of tennis, badminton, and volleyball. The court dimensions and layout are similar to those of badminton; the scoring is similar to the old scoring system in volleyball (a player must be serving to score); and serves must be diagonal, as in tennis. Footbag net games can be played to 11 or 15 points, although the winners must win by at least two points. Rallies in footbag net look a lot like volleyball (e.g., bump, set, and spike), with players spiking from an inverted position in mid- air (over the net) and opponents often digging very fast spikes into bumps or sets. Play in footbag net is very similar to Sepak Takraw. However, in footbag net, it is an \\"upper-body foul\\" if the footbag touches any part of a player's body above the shin. =Other= The most successful footbag doubles team, multiple world champions and innovators Martin Sladek and Tomas Tucek Eric Wulff executing a Roll spike at the 2008 Green Cup, San Francisco ;Basse: An old Norwegian foot bag game reminiscent of bag ball, where a player defends their circle. Usually, there are five to six players - where everyone plays against everyone. The aim of the game is for a player to defend their own field while attempting to land the Basse inside the field of an opponent. There are World Cup rules, Series Games, and Cup Games. ;Buce: A game in which players in a team must juggle the footbag across a field to the opponent's half and score a goal, by kicking the footbag into a small, cylindrical container, usually a bin or pot plant. The sport was invented in Australia in 2007 and is played there with two annual national competitions. ;Hack Slap: A game played with 4, 6, 8 or more people and the object is to keep the 'footbag' in the air by any means necessary, excluding hands. When someone fails to keep the footbag in the air, hit it with an upward trajectory, or the 'footbag' fails to make it to an opponents square, they are eliminated. ;Footbag Golf: A game in which a player must kick the bag towards a designated target (18 inches in diameter and 18 inches off the ground) while navigating the course. A course is usually made up of 9 or 18 holes, and the distance between the tee and target varies from hole to hole. The game can include any number of players. A player begins a hole by teeing off from a six foot by six foot box by tossing the bag in the air and kicking it with the intention of getting the footbag as close to the target as possible. Where the footbag lands and comes to a complete stop is called the lie. After all players have teed off, the player furthest from the target marks the lie and tosses the bag for another kick. All kicks must be made behind the lie and a player cannot move past the lie until the kick is completed. Once all the players have successfully kicked their bags into the target, they may move on to the next hole. ;Horse:A game that can be played with any number of players and is a great way to improve one's freestyle. One of the players performs any freestyle move they choose, then passes it on to the next player who then attempts to perform the same move. If the player performs the move correctly then that they perform a different move of their choice and then pass it on. If they fail to do the move then they get a letter \\"H\\" (if they miss again on the next round they get an \\"O\\") and passes it on to the next player who chooses a new trick. Once a player spells the word \\"Horse\\" they are out. ;Kick Back: A game at which a player can kick the footbag against the backstop of a handball court, alone or with others. It needs a very firm footbag to bounce back. A simple score can be kept or not. ;Killer: A game similar to War. The hacky sack is kicked around and after a certain number of kicks, a player can kick the sack at another player, trying to peg them. If the hacky sack hits them they are out unless they can hack the sack back in to the circle before it hits the ground. Self-serving, tossing the sack to yourself, is often banned in this game and if done the round is stopped and the rule breaker is pegged, thrown, with the sack. ;Knockout: A game that can be played with any number of players, in which players are eliminated by failure to hit the hack. The hack is passed around randomly to any player, and the goal is to keep it going indefinitely; if the hack lands on the ground near another player who could have hit it (within 2 feet of him/her), that player is eliminated for the failure. If the hack lands drastically out of range of any player, then the player who kicked it out of bounds is eliminated. Some groups can apply a more strict rule where, when the hack drops, any player who lifts their foot off the ground in an attempt to kick it is eliminated. ;Number Catch:A game where any number of players (best played with 3 or 4) have to alternate turns hitting the footbag as many times as possible and must catch it for the points to count if the bag is dropped the player must subtract the points from their score. This game may be played to a certain score or a certain time to get as many points as possible. ;Numbers:A game in which players form a circle and the person who starts kicks the hack once. Then the second person kicks it twice and so on and so forth. If the hack touches the ground before the player achieves their number, the player gets one chance to start where they left off. If the player does not achieve their number, they pass the footbag on to the next player, and if they achieve that number the previous player is out. ;Shark:A game where two or more players can play. The goal is to hit the sack a previously set number of times before a player catches it and says: \\"shark.\\" When the person says \\"shark\\" the other players must stay where they are, and the \\"shark\\" has the ability to throw it at any player. If a player is hit, the player is out or has a point that goes against their score. Last player standing wins. When a player says \\"shark,\\" the others players can move only one foot once to reposition themself. It is common to use that one move to dodge the sack. ;War: A game for any number of players. The footbag is served and after a predetermined number (usually 3) of kicks (whether by one person, or collectively as a group) everyone tries to catch it. The person who catches the footbag throws it at one of the other players who try to either dodge or catch it. If the footbag hits someone they are out, but if they catch it the person who threw it is out. The game can be played with any number of outs. Also known by the names \\"Pelt\\", \\"Three Balls of Fire\\", \\"Three Hit Kill\\", \\"Three Hack Wack\\", \\"Applesauce\\", \\"Red Dot\\", and \\"God\\". =Variations= Although there is no 'winning' in the original game of hacky-sack, several variations have come into play in recent years. These include three-hack-slap and hack-elimination. The rules to three-hack-slap are as follows: play begins in the same fashion as the traditional game, but after three players have volleyed the sack consecutively, any player may slap the sack in an attempt to hit another player. If the slapping player succeeds in hitting another player, the player that was hit is out indefinitely until the next game begins. In some versions of the game, if a player is 'out', they may still participate in the game, but they may neither slap nor be slapped. The three touches taken before the slap must be taken by separate players. For example, if a player gets fed the sack, and kicks it up three times, that counts as only one touch. However, if the sack is kicked by one player, then another, but returns to the player who kicked the ball originally, that does count as three touches. Essentially, every time that the sack changes feet, that counts as a point towards the three points necessary to slap. Play continues likewise until one player remains, that player is crowned the winner, and play restarts. In hack- elimination, play also begins like in the original game, and as play goes on, every player tries to get a touch on the sack. If everyone has touched the sack except for one person, the player who has not yet touched the sack is ruled out. Play continues until only two players are left, and those two are the winners. Another more aggressive variation on the hack-slap called 'killz' exists ideally for bigger groups. In a bigger group, you may come across players with varying skill levels and the lesser skilled are a risk for not being able to complete a full hack. This variation allows 3 touches anyway possible if it be with one, two, or three players out of the x number of participants, after which you may kick the sack as hard you like in the direction of any player to try to get them out. Defense is important as you are allowed to block, which encourages trickier play: fakes, stalls, and rebounds. This game has one winner.

Lopez, Jr., 514 U.S. 549 (1995), was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court concerning the Commerce Clause. It was the first case since 1937 in which the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. The case arose from a San Antonio high school student's challenge to the Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990, which banned possession of handguns near schools. In a majority decision joined by four other justices, Chief Justice William Rehnquist held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, that power did not extend to the regulation of the carrying of handguns. In his dissent, Associate Justice Stephen Breyer argued that Congress could regulate handgun possession under the Commerce Clause because gun violence could have a significant effect on interstate commerce by impairing educational environments. Though it did not reverse any past ruling about the meaning of the Commerce Clause, Lopez raised serious questions as to how far the Court might be willing to go in curbing Congress' powers under the Commerce Clause. The Court would later further limit congressional powers under the Commerce Clause in United States v. Morrison (2000). After the Lopez decision, the Gun- Free School Zones Act of 1990 was amended to specifically only apply to guns that had been moved via interstate commerce. Background Alfonso Lopez, Jr., was a 12th-grade student at Edison High School in San Antonio, Texas. On March 10, 1992, he carried a concealed .38 caliber revolver, along with five cartridges, into the school. The gun was not loaded; Lopez claimed that he was to deliver the weapon to another person, a service for which he would receive $44.Court of Appeals opinion p. 4. He was confronted by school authorities‚Äîthe school had received anonymous tips that Lopez was carrying the weapon‚Äîand admitted to having the weapon. The next day, he was charged with violating the federalInitially Lopez was charged with the state law crime of possession of a firearm on school premises, but these charges were dismissed in favor of the federal charges. Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990 (the \\"Act\\"), .The federal grand jury indicted Lopez on one count of \\"knowing possession of a firearm at a school zone,\\" in violation of ¬ß922(q) of the Act. Lopez moved to dismiss the indictment on the ground that ¬ß922(q) of the Act was \\"unconstitutional as it is beyond the power of Congress to legislate control over our public schools.\\"514 U.S. at 551. The trial court denied the motion, ruling that ¬ß922(q) was \\"a constitutional exercise of Congress' well defined power to regulate activities in and affecting commerce, and the 'business' of elementary, middle and high schools...affects interstate commerce.\\"514 U.S. at 551-52. Lopez was tried and convicted. He appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals, claiming that ¬ß922(q) exceeded Congress' power to legislate under the Commerce Clause.514 U.S. at 552. The Fifth Circuit agreed and reversed his conviction, holding that \\"section 922(q), in the full reach of its terms, is invalid as beyond the power of Congress under the Commerce Clause.\\" The Court of Appeals noted that the legislative history of the Act did not justify it as an exercise of the Commerce Clause power of Congress, suggesting that a new version of the Act which recited more of a nexus with interstate commerce might be devised, although what that nexus might be, is difficult to harmonize with the text of the decision, as the Court clearly stated that the situation posed only a \\"trivial impact\\" upon commerce.\\"...there was no testimony [before Congressional committees] concerning the effect of [gun] violence on interstate commerce... neither [the House nor the Senate] sponsor had anything to say about commerce in their remarks... Neither [in Maryland v. Wirtz] nor in Wickard v. Filburn has the [Supreme] Court declared that Congress may use a relatively trivial impact on commerce as an excuse for broad general regulation... Indeed, it could not be otherwise as the chain of causation is virtually infinite, and hence there is no private activity, no matter how local and insignificant, the ripple effect from which is not in some theoretical measure ultimately felt beyond the borders of the state in which it took place.\\" Lopez, 2 F.3d at 1361-62. The United States government filed a petition for certiorari, whereby the Court has discretion to hear or to decline a particular case, for Supreme Court review and the Court accepted the case. To sustain the Act, the government was obligated to show that ¬ß922(q) was a valid exercise of the Congressional Commerce Clause power,When the power of Congress is challenged, the party asserting the existence of the power ‚Äî here, the Government ‚Äî bears the burden of demonstrating that the power exists. i.e. that the section regulated a matter which \\"affected\\" (or \\"substantially affected\\")There was some question over the wording of the legal test, with the Court eventually opting to include the word \\"substantially\\" with \\"affect(s).\\" interstate commerce.The Court of Appeals noted how broadly the challenged section of the Act swept by its terms: \\"[It would] criminalize any person's carrying of an unloaded shotgun, in an unlocked pickup truck gun rack, while driving on a country road that at one turn happens to come within 950 feet of the boundary of... a church kindergarten... even during the summer when the kindergarten is not in session.\\" Lopez, 2 F.3d at 1366. The government's principal argument was that the possession of a firearm in an educational environment would most likely lead to a violent crime, which in turn would affect the general economic condition in two ways. First, because violent crime causes harm and creates expense, it raises insurance costs, which are spread throughout the economy; and second, by limiting the willingness to travel in the area perceived to be unsafe. The government also argued that the presence of firearms within a school would be seen as dangerous, resulting in students' being scared and disturbed; this would, in turn, inhibit learning; and this, in turn, would lead to a weaker national economy since education is clearly a crucial element of the nation's financial health. Supreme Court decision In a 5‚Äì4 decision, the Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals. It held that while Congress had broad lawmaking authority under the Commerce Clause, the power was limited, and did not extend so far from \\"commerce\\" as to authorize the regulation of the carrying of handguns, of aggregate effect. Chief Justice Rehnquist, delivering the opinion of the Court, identified the three broad categories of activity that Congress could regulate under the Commerce Clause: * The use of channels of interstate commerce * The instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activitiesFor instance, Congress can regulate motor vehicles used in interstate commerce or can criminalize theft from interstate shipments, p.xx * Activities that substantially affect or substantially relate to interstate commerce\\"Consistent with this structure, we have identified three broad categories of activity that Congress may regulate under its commerce power... First, Congress may regulate the use of the channels of interstate commerce... Second, Congress is empowered to regulate and protect the instrumentalities of interstate commerce, or persons or things in interstate commerce, even though the threat may come only from intrastate activities... Finally, Congress' commerce authority includes the power to regulate those activities having a substantial relation to interstate commerce, i.e., those activities that substantially affect interstate commerce.\\" He said they had summarily dismissed any consideration of the first two categories and concluded that the resolution of the case depended only on consideration of the third category‚Äîregulation of activities that substantially affect interstate commerce. The Court essentially concluded that in no way was the carrying of handguns a commercial activity or even related to any sort of economic enterprise, even under the most extravagant definitions.\\"Where economic activity substantially affects interstate commerce, legislation regulating that activity will be sustained... [But] this is not an essential part of a larger regulation of economic activity [and is not an activity arising] out of or connected with a commercial transaction which, when viewed in the aggregate, substantially affects interstate commerce... [Instead,] section 922(q) is a criminal statute that by its terms has nothing to do with \\"commerce\\" or any sort of economic enterprise, however broadly one might define those terms... States possess primary authority for defining and enforcing the criminal law... When Congress criminalizes conduct already denounced as criminal by the States, it effects a change in the sensitive relation between federal and state criminal jurisdiction.\\" p. xxy. The opinion rejected the government's argument that because crime negatively impacted education, Congress might have reasonably concluded that crime in schools substantially affects commerce. The Court reasoned that if Congress could regulate something so far removed from commerce, then it could regulate anything, and since the Constitution clearly creates Congress as a body with enumerated powers, this could not be so. Rehnquist concluded: The Court specifically looked to four factors in determining whether legislation represents a valid effort to use the Commerce Clause power to regulate activities that substantially affect interstate commerce: #Whether the activity was non-economic as opposed to economic activity; previous cases involved economic activity #Jurisdictional element: whether the gun had moved in interstate commerce #Whether there had been congressional findings of an economic link between guns and education #How attenuated the link was between the regulated activity and interstate commerce Although the ruling stopped a decades-long trend of inclusiveness under the commerce clause, it did not reverse any past ruling about the meaning of the clause. Later, Rehnquist stated that the Court had the duty to prevent the legislative branch from usurping state powers over policing the conduct of their citizens. He admitted that the Supreme Court had upheld certain governmental steps towards taking power away from the states, and cited Lopez as a decision that finally stepped in to check the government's authority by defining clearly between state and federal powers.William H. Rehnquist, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, _American Constitutional Interpretation, Third Edition_ , 2000, Ed. Walter F. Murphy, James E. Fleming, Sotirios A. Barber, and Stephen Macedo, pgs. 639-640 Dissenting opinions Justice Breyer authored the principal dissenting opinion.Justices Stevens, Souter and Ginsburg joined the Breyer dissent in this 5-4 decision. As noted below, Justice Souter and Justice Stevens each wrote an additional individual dissent. He applied three principles that he considered basic: #The Commerce Clause included the power to regulate local activities so long as those \\"significantly affect\\" interstate commerce. #In considering the question, a court must consider not the individual act being regulated (a single instance of gun possession), but rather the cumulative effect of all similar acts (i.e., the effect of all guns possessed in or near schools). #A court must specifically determine not whether the regulated activity significantly affected interstate commerce, but whether Congress could have had a \\"rational basis\\" for so concluding.\\"[We] judge the connection between a regulated activity and interstate commerce, not directly, but at one remove.\\" p. xx With these principles in mind, Justice Breyer asked if Congress could have rationally found that the adverse effect of violent crime in school zones, acting through the intermediary effect of degrading the quality of education, could significantly affect interstate commerce. Based on the existence of empirical studies, he answered this question affirmatively.\\"Congress could also have found ... that gun related violence in and around schools is a commercial, as well as a human, problem.\\" p. xx. He pointed out the growing importance of education in the job market, noting that increased global competition made primary and secondary education more important.p. xxy He also observed that US firms make location decisions, in part, on the presence or absence of an educated work force.. yyx Justice Breyer concluded that it was obvious that gun violence could have an effect on interstate commerce. The only question remaining, then, was whether Congress could have rationally concluded that the effect could be \\"substantial.\\" Congress could have rationally concluded, in Justice Breyer's judgment, that the linkage from gun violence to an impaired learning environment, and from this impaired environment to the consequent adverse economic effects, was sufficient to create a risk to interstate commerce that was \\"substantial.\\"\\"Congress could have [rationally] found that gun related violence near the classroom poses a serious economic threat to [both] ... inadequately educated workers [destined for] ... low paying jobs ... and to ... businesses that might (in today's 'information society') otherwise gain ... an important commercial advantage.\\"p. xx Congress, in Justice Breyer's view, had a rational basis \\"for finding a significant connection between guns in or near schools and (through their effect on education) the interstate and foreign commerce they threaten.\\" In his opinion, no more than this was required to find sufficient supporting power for the challenged law under the Commerce Clause, and he consequently believed that the Court of Appeals had erred and should be reversed. In his dissent, Justice Souter warned that the distinction between \\"commercial\\" and \\"non-commercial\\" activity was not tenable. He echoed the \\"rational basis\\" theme of the Breyer dissent.The question ... is not... whether Congress in fact found that a particular activity substantially affects interstate commerce. The [enactment of the] legislation implies such a finding, and there is no reason to entertain claims that Congress acted ultra vires intentionally. Nor is the question whether Congress was correct in so finding. The only question is whether the legislative judgment is within the realm of reason.... Justice Breyer's opinion demonstrates beyond any doubt that the Act in question passes the rationality review [standard]. p. xxy Justice Stevens, in his dissent, iterated his agreement with the Breyer dissent that found ample congressional power under the Commerce Clause to regulate the possession of firearms in schools, in the same way that Congress may act to protect the school environment from alcohol or asbestos. He also agreed with Justice Souter's \\"exposition of the radical character of the Court's holding and its kinship with the discredited, pre-Depression version of substantive due process.\\"p. xxy.  Aftermath  Lopez was the first case since 1937 in which the Court held that Congress had exceeded its power to legislate under the Commerce Clause. It raised serious questions as to how far the Court might be willing to go in implementing judicial safeguards against federal encroachments on state sovereignty.Erwin Chemerinsky, Professor of Law and Political Science at the University of Southern California, Florida Law Review, \\"The Values of Federalism\\", September 1995, 46 Fla. L. Rev. 499 The precedent takes special significance in cases that the federal government attempts to limit private conduct. Commentators still postulate its possible effects on other established federal laws enacted pursuant to the Commerce Clause. The argument can be made that the significant limiting of federal power is necessary to establish a greater threshold for governmental accountability and revitalizes the role of the states in public policymaking. It can also be ascribed to new legislation that makes open carry in schools legal in some Texas jurisdictions.Kristin Collins, J.D., Yale Law School, _Cardozo Law Review_ , April 2005, pg.

It is headed by the Minister of National Defense. The MND was set up according to a decision adopted by the 1st Session of the 1st National People's Congress in 1954. In contrast to practice in other nations, the MND does not exercise command authority over the People's Liberation Army (PLA), which is instead subordinate to the Central Military Commission (CMC). Instead, the MND itself only serves as liaison body representing the CMC and PLA when dealing with foreign militaries in military exchange and cooperation. Its official responsibilities had been to exercise unified administration over the development of the armed forces of the country such as recruitment, organization, equipment, training, scientific military research of the PLA and the ranking and remuneration of the officers and servicemen. However, in reality these responsibilities are carried out by the CMC's 15 departments.  Structure  There are a number of departments under the Ministry of National Defense: * General Office * Foreign Affairs Office * Peacekeeping Office * Mobilisation Office The Ministry of National Defense General Office is in fact the same body as the CMC General Office. Other offices are also staffed by personnel from the Joint Staff Department.  Minister  Although the Ministry itself does not exercise much authority, the role of the Minister of National Defense has always been viewed as one of the most important positions in the country's political system. The position of Minister has always been given to an active military officer (with the exception of Geng Biao), a State Councilor and a member of the Communist Party's Central Committee and member (sometimes a Vice Chairman) of the Central Military Commission, enabling him to take part in the decision making in the PLA, the Government and the Party.

Sentou Gakuen has undergone two pre-testings: October 16 and 24, 2011 and an Open Beta on December 29, 2011. The game was released on January 1, 2012 as a web browser gamePST Team Announces Release Date For The Sentou Gakuen and was described by the development team as the first to combine both Visual novel and MMORPG aspects to a game.  Gameplay  The gameplay of Sentou Gakuen, is made up of text dialogues. The text displayed on the screen depicts conversations between different characters and/or the thoughts of those characters. The \\"Story Mode\\" of the game is illustrated in a Visual Novel style. As an option, players are allowed to opt out of the dialogue between characters. Once the story is finished, players may continue the game, thus leaving it open ended. Just like other MMORPG-type games, each character has their own statistics. To increase their statistics, players must take lessons and attend classes; if the player wishes to increase their strength, they attend physical education classes. Other statistics such as energy are required for training. Willpower determines the efficiency of player actions. Action points are used to perform actions. Experience represents the progress required till the player-character levels up. Health is a finite value used to determine how much damage, usually in terms of physical injury, the player can withstand. In Sentou Gakuen, the players can equip themselves with various weapons, such as a pencil or a ruler. For extra money, a player can take a part-time job. = Club = Students who share a similar goal, vision, or interest are allowed to form their own club. Clubs are organizations formed by the students themselves, each with its own facilities, president, and vice president. Clubs also have the ability to organize club activities, which require participation from their members. Joining a club is an important task in order to survive on Sentou Gakuen. = Dating System = It is possible to have a relationship with another student. Being in a relationship will bring players to a new menu located in the Personal Area, called the Couples menu, where there will be special actions that can be done once per day. In order to be a couple with another student, players need to put a Love Letter into the target's Shoe Locker Box. If the target accepts the confession, they become a couple. If the target rejects the confession, nothing happens. On Sentou Gakuen there are certain NPCs who the player may date. In order to do this, players need to win their Affection Points. Each NPC has a different way to earn the points; some examples are: maxing out certain statistics, giving presents, etc. There are hints on Story Mode about how to earn Affection Points for each NPC. Every week, NPCs will re-select from the Sentou Gakuen database of players and sort based on their Affection Points. NPCs will then write a love letter to the players that have the highest Affection Points for them. However, it is up to the players whether to accept their confessions or not. If the target player accepts, they will both be in a relationship. If the player rejects, the NPCs will stay single for the week and re-select again from the database the following week. Thus, maintaining a relationship with a NPC is hard and would need a lot of effort to keep the Affection Points high.  Story  Sentou Gakuen primarily takes place in a fictional school called Sentou High School, which is located in Tokyo. Physical locales of Tokyo such as Shibuya Scramble Crossing, and Wako Shop at Ginza can be spotted in the game. When the story begins, the player assumes the role of a new freshman student at Sentou High School where they will meet new friends and several of their childhood friends as their journey begins.  Characters  *Kiyomizu Ichirou (Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ ‰∏ÄÈÉé) Ichirou is a bespectacled male student with a very keen interest in all things 2-dimensional. He makes his infatuation in female anime characters clear to others around him, and does not mind being a social outcast for his preferences. He enjoys exploring the unknown even though he knows it will get him into various mishaps. *Kojima Takayuki (Â∞èÂ≥∂ ÈöÜË°å) Takayuki has the appearance of an ordinary student; gets average grades in school and does not stand out amongst his peers. Being a typical generic student would be true for him, but the fact that he is a gifted cook and secretly acts as Sentou Gakuen's head cafeteria chef on occasion, voids such a label. *Takeuchi Iwao (Á´πÂÜÖ Â∑å) Iwao is a pretty-boy who often attracts the attention of many girls alike, that is, until he decides to open his mouth. He is fairly conceited and believes good things will come to him without him having to do doing anything, which often causes disgust by other people. He has very high goals but wants to reach them as easily as possible, with little to no effort on his part. *Matsumoto Fumiko (ÊùæÊú¨ ÊñáÂ≠ê) Fumiko, the first-year-class representative, is a girl who follows the straight and narrow path. Although she does not show this attribute on the outside, she cares for the well-being of other students. Many people underestimate her athletic ability because of her work ethic in school, which makes her seem like a person whose only interest is studying. However, in hostile situations, she will fully display her expertise in martial arts. She is serious about maintaining stability in Sentou Gakuen and seeks to rid the school of all possible misdemeanors. *Sasaki Yukiko (‰Ωê„ÄÖÊú® Áî±Â∏åÂ≠ê) Yukiko is a typical schoolgirl; she is loud, talkative and speaks her mind just because she feels it is what people should always do, as a natural extrovert. Working in various odd-jobs and having conversations with people abroad had turned her into a very sociable person. She always believes enough is never enough and in working as hard as one should to secure a decent future. *Fujita Eiko (Ëó§Áî∞ Ê†ÑÂ≠ê) *Kiyomizu Miharu(Ê∏ÖÊ∞¥ ÁæéÊò•) *RA Widya Wulandari  References   External links  * Sentou Gakuen at VNDB * Official Sentou Gakuen website * Sentou Gakuen Library Category:Browser games Category:High school-themed video games Category:Visual novels Category:Massively multiplayer online games Category:Massively multiplayer online role-playing games Category:2012 video games Category:Video games developed in Indonesia Category:Video games set in Japan ","title":"Sentou Gakuen"},{"id":"33632662","text":"Latiaxis mawae is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Muricidae, the murex snails or rock snails.

Johnny & Associates's CEO Johnny Kitagawa said, \\"The group name came from Michael Jackson's sexiness\\". The members were revealed to be Kento Nakajima, Fuma Kikuchi, Shori Sato, So Matsushima, and Marius Yo. Kitagawa chose the members considering the \\"sexiness of men\\". After the press conference, the members appeared in Teigeki Johnnys Imperial Theatre Special \\"Kis-My-Ft2 with Johnny's Jr.\\", and premiered their debut song \\"Sexy Zone\\", which was subsequently released on November 16, 2011 from Pony Canyon.

Their seventh single \\"Otoko Never Give Up\\", eighth single \\"Kimi ni Hitomebore\\" and their ninth single \\"Cha-Cha-Cha Champion\\" only featured members Kento Nakajima, Fuma Kikuchi and Shori Sato. This resulted in rumours amongst fans about the future of Marius Yo and Sou Matsushima, the two youngest members of the group. The reason behind their temporary removal from the group was that Sexy Zone had become popular and the schedule was almost packed, resulting in Sou Matsushima unable to travel from Shizuoka to his work. Marius Yo was disbanded from the group temporarily to balance the group formation. In 2015, for their 12th single, Marius Yo and Sou Matsushima returned to Sexy Zone from Johnny's Jr groups, as Sou Matsushima had enrolled into a high school in Tokyo.

It is a National Historic Site of Canada and is Canada's largest church, with one of the largest church domes in the world. Founded in 1904 by Saint Andr√© Bessette in his patron saint, Saint Joseph's honour, the Oratory was brought alive through the work and ingenuity of numerous architects and thousands of workers in a process spanning six decades. With its monumental scale, Renaissance Revival facade and contrasting Art Deco interior, the Oratory is recognizable not just in Montreal but around the world, attracting more than 2 million visitors and pilgrims to its steps each year. The Oratory is the highest building in Montreal, rising more than 30 meters above Mount Royal's summit, allowing it to be seen from many kilometers away. It is one of the few buildings that violates the height restriction under the municipal building code of Montreal, which limits the height of any building, including skycrapers, from surpassing the height of Mount Royal. Since 2018, the dome and lantern atop the Oratory have undergone a series of renovations expected to be completed in 2022 by architecture firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49. The C$80 million project will create safe access to the lantern which will allow for an unprecedented 360-degree view over the mountain of the city. History =Early history= Saint Andr√© Bessette, C.S.C. (1845-1937), more commonly known as Brother Andr√©, was a monk and a member of the Congregation of Holy Cross who became internationally renowned as a miracle healer. Due to his reputation, in 1904 he was given funding to construct a small chapel on Mount-Royal across from Notre Dame College to operate out of. The small, Gothic Revival style chapel expanded four times over the next decade with the growing of Brother Andr√©'s fame and the Congregation decided to fulfill his request to build a basilica in his patron saint, Saint Joseph's honor. The original chapel, measuring 4.5 meters by 5.5 meters still stands today, though it has since been relocated about a hundred meters away to make room for the massive basilica that stands today. Andr√© Bessette, C.S.C., commonly known as Brother Andr√©. The first phase of the basilica‚Äôs construction involved architects Dalb√© Viau (1881- 1938) and Alphonse Venne (1875-1934) who had previously done work for the Congregation. From 1914 to 1916, Viau and Venne constructed the crypt church, with seating for 1000, which still stands today and forms the base of the basilica where the massive collection of stairs ends. Between 1924 and 1927, the crypt and building up until the roof were completed in the Renaissance Revival style. Viau and Venne had wanted the dome of the Oratory to resemble that of St. Peter‚Äôs Basilica in Rome and to be smaller than it actually is today, however they never had the chance to see those plans through as construction was halted with the Great Depression. =After the Great Depression= In 1937, Dom Paul Bellot (1876-1944), born in France, was hired to work after the death of Venne, however he was required to work through Canadian Lucien Parent (1893-1956) due to not being a registered architect in Quebec. He redesigned Viau and Venne's roof and dome entirely, making the dome significantly larger and modelling it to resemble the dome of Florence Cathedral. The construction of his large Oratory dome lasted four years and was completed in 1941 after involving thousands of workers. Construction of the dome in 1937. From 1949‚Äì1951, architect Gilbert Moreau carried out alterations and improvements to the interior of Saint Joseph's Oratory, as well as to the adjacent monastery, and rearranged the sacristy in the basilica. Composer √âmilien Allard was the church's carillonneur from 1955 to 1975. For RCA Victor he released the LP album Carols at the Carillon of Saint Joseph's Oratory for which he wrote the arrangements.\\"La vie et la mort d'un carillonneur\\", Musique p√©riodique, vol 1, Jan‚ÄìFeb 1977 =21st century= On October 19, 2004, the Oratory held its centennial. All the bells of all the churches on the island of Montreal were supposed to ring at 9:00 a.m., though not all churches participated. At 9:05 a.m., the basilica rang its bell in response and celebration. The Oratory's bells were rung in October 2004, to commemorate the centennial of the building's construction. On April 2, again to commemorate the Oratory's centennial, Canada Post issued 'Saint Joseph's Oratory, Quebec' in the 2004 Tourist Attractions series. The stamp was designed by Catharine Bradbury & William Stewart based on a photograph by Bernard Brault. The 49¬¢ stamps are perforated kiss cut and were printed by Lowe-Martin Company Inc. That same year, the Oratory was designated a National Historic Site of Canada. On October 30, 2007, Father Charles Corso, a priest at the Oratory, was faced with a disorganized and depressed man who threatened to kill himself with a handgun. The priest talked with the man and managed to calm him down before police arrived on scene. The man was brought to hospital to undergo psychiatric evaluation. On March 22, 2019, a 26-year-old man wearing a dark winter coat and light-coloured baseball cap entered the Oratory during the Friday morning mass, rapidly walked up to the centre, and stabbed the celebrating priest, Father Claude Grou. Of the fifty people attending mass, several intervened to neutralize the assailant, before security guards responded. Police officers from the Service de police de la Ville de Montr√©al quickly arrived on scene and arrested the assaillant who was already detained by security personnel. The assaulted priest suffered only minor injuries, a single stab wound to the chest. That same evening, upon being wheeled out of the Montreal General Hospital, he said, \\"My health is fine. I‚Äôll take a little rest and I will be back to work when my rest is taken. And the Oratory will remain a place where people can be welcomed. A place of prayers, and a place of calm, and a place of peace - even if there are some moments like that.\\" Today, the basilica enshrines a statue of Saint Joseph, which was authorised a Canonical coronation by Pope Pius X on 19 March 1910 via Cardinal Vincenzo Vannutelli, previously enshrined at the C√¥te-des-Neiges Chapel. The image moved to the new modern basilica and was recrowned on 9 August 1955 via Cardinal Paul-√âmile L√©ger now located within its oil chapel department. Architecture and structure Interior of the crypt church, showing the barrel vaulting of its ceiling. The interior of the basilica, with its bright colours, stained glass and iconic multi-angled arches. The dome, as seen from the interior of the basilica. When the basilica‚Äôs construction began in 1914, many architects were challenging the conventional Beaux-Arts style and neoclassicism. This period was exactly around the time where expressionist architecture, constructivist architecture, Bauhaus ideas and many other facets of modern architecture began to take off, with pioneers like Le Corbusier in Europe and Frank Lloyd Wright in the United States refusing to be categorized by traditional architectural styles. It was certainly atypical for monumental classical church buildings to be constructed in cities around this time, yet Saint Joseph's Oratory was one of the largest buildings in Montreal when it was constructed, and was designed in Renaissance Revival exterior with an Art Deco interior. The basilica, as it stands today, comprises many parts, including the Crypt Church, located underneath the basilica, the Votive Chapel, between the Crypt and the rock of Mount-Royal, the Shrine, which encompasses the nave, apse and transept, and the dome, which is the largest church dome in Canada and the third largest in the world. =Crypt Church= The Crypt Church, originally designed by Viau and Venne, measures , has a seating capacity of 1000 people and is designed in a neoclassical style. The ceiling is supported using the barrel vaulting of steel-reinforced concrete arches. The church is called a \\"crypt\\" due to its flattened arches as well as its position embedded into the mountain underneath the basilica. There is a statue of Joseph made out of Carrara marble behind the main altar of the Crypt Church, added in 1917 by the Italian artist A. Giacomini. Eight stained glass windows depicting the stages in Saint Joseph's life were installed in the crypt in 1919 by the Montreal firm Perdriau et O'Shea. =Votive Chapel= Added between 1946-1949 between the Crypt Church and the rock of Mount Royal, the Votive Chapel is designed in Art Deco style from the plans of Lucien Parent, and relies on heavy use of geometric forms (square columns, square paneling on ceiling). The Chapel measures and contains approximately 10,000 candles, with the central lampstand in front of the statue of Saint Joseph holding approximately 3500 votive candles. The chapel, also referred to as \\"the Chapel of Ex-votos,\\" has nearly 1000 Ex-votos (canes, crutches, etc.) suspended within it, left behind by pilgrims during the life of Brother Andr√©. The Chapel also contains eight bas-reliefs designed by Canadian sculptor, Joseph Guardo in 1948, which illustrate eight of the attributes which Christianity has accorded to Saint Joseph. The tomb of Saint Andr√©, sculpted in black marble, rests in an alcove in the middle of the Votive Chapel. =Shrine= The interior of the basilica, known as the Shrine, was designed using concepts by Dom Bellot as well as Canadian architect G√©rard Notebaert, and uses a Latin cross layout with a dome at the crossing. The interior has an overall length of . The nave, which contains pews to seat 2028 people (with a maximum capacity of 10,000 people), measures in width, while the transept measures and connects to the shrine of Brother Andr√©. The apse, as well as the rest of the interior, is designed in Art Deco style, which was very popular in Montreal during the 1930s, and contains sculptures, bas-reliefs, mosaics and stained glass of religious imagery. The roof of the basilica is held up using reinforced concrete multi-angle arches iconic of Dom Bellot‚Äôs style. The exterior of the Oratory is constructed using large blocks of granite from Lac M√©gantic quarries in Quebec. The colonnade at the front fa√ßade of the building consists of four -tall, -thick Corinthian columns which provide the structural support for the entablature of the front portico. It is also corniced and ornamented. The staircase which leads from the street to the base of the basilica contain two parallel flights of 283 concrete steps separated by a central flight of 99 wooden steps reserved for pilgrims who wish to climb on their knees. =Dome= The dome of Saint Joseph‚Äôs Oratory is the largest church dome in Canada and among the largest and the tallest domes in the world, and this is a result of Dom Bellot‚Äôs very inspired and ambitious designs. His plans for the dome are very similar to those of Florence Cathedral, being of a ‚Äúdouble shell‚Äù design, meaning it consists of two domes, one on the interior and one on the exterior with empty space in between. Like the cathedral in Florence, the outer dome of the Oratory consists of eight pointed arches laying atop an octagonal drum, with a lantern and cross. The outer dome of the Oratory measures only in thickness and the inner dome measures only about in thickness, which is approximately 18 times thinner than the dome of St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. The concrete shell of the Oratory's dome is so thin in fact that when related to its overall size, it is akin to an eggshell. The two domes vary immensely span and height, with the outer dome measuring in diameter and rising from the nave floor and the inner dome measuring in diameter and rising from the nave floor. There are 16 steel buttresses along the inner walls of the drums that provide the structural support for the dome. They serve to brace the inner dome against the outer dome, thus making the supporting walls for both domes more rigid. Modern developments In 2018, the architectural firms Atelier TAG and Architecture49 won a competition to renovate the inside of the dome of Saint Joseph's Oratory and its observatory. The project is estimated to cost around $80 million CAD and will also include a complete renovation of the building's museum and the construction of a new welcome centre on Queen Mary road. The lantern will have space for up to 17 visitors at a time and will offer the only 360-degree view over the mountain in the city. As of 2019, renovations are underway.

The peak is located in Pike National Forest, southwest by west (bearing 233¬∞) of downtown Colorado Springs in Teller County, Colorado, United States. Mountain Mount Rosa rises above downtown Colorado Springs and is among the taller summits on the city's skyline. Hiking Hikers may access Mt. Rosa and its summit by way of several hiking trails in the area. The most common route is the Frosty Park Route, and may be accessed by taking Cheyenne Mountain Blvd. in the Broadmoor neighborhood, towards the west, then Old Stage Road and Gold Camp Road for 11.1 miles until Forest Road 379 is reached. FR 379 is a rough 4wd road and should only be driven using a vehicle that has both 4wd and high clearance, (there's one stream crossing near the beginning of the road which may have a substantial amount of water in it, depending on the season). Take FR 379 for about 1.5 miles until you reach a large clearing on the western flank on Mt. Rosa. Park here (38¬∞45'36.71\\"N, 104¬∞57'37.07\\"W), and begin your hike along the unnamed trail to the east until you reach trail 672. Follow trail 672 up the western flank of Mt.

It closed down for three years at the end of World War II, from 1944 to 1947, and again during the Korean War from 1950 to 1952. It closed down once again in 1957, to be reopened as a religious school recognized by the government in 1964. 1964 is thus recognized by some as the date of the school's actual founding.

He is famous for his short stories and essays. He is regarded as a successor of Beijing School Writers. Biography Former Residence of Wang Zengqi in Gaoyou.Wang was born in a landowner family in 1920 in Gaoyou, Jiangsu province. In 1939, he enrolled into then National Southwestern Associated University. He was tutored by Shen Congwen during his university life and then started writing in 1940. He finished the first draft of Fuchou [Revenge]. He should have graduated in 1943, however, the graduation was postponed to the next year since he failed PE and English. For unknown reason, he failed to obey the university's arrangement to act as an interpreter for the US army, so he didn't get his certificate eventually. Later he became a teacher at a high school in Kunming from 1944 to 1946, where he fell love with Shi Songqin, and then in Shanghai until 1948. He moved to Beijing and got a job at a museum later in the year. He followed the Fourth Field Army to go to the southern as a civil cadre in the next year. He became an editor after being transferred to Beijing in 1950. He adapted the story of Fan Jin in Chapter 3 of Rulin waishi [The Unofficial History of the Scholars] for the Peking opera and gained reputation in the 1950s, it also contributed to his being transferred to Beijing Peking Opera Theater in 1961. He was targeted at the Anti-Rightist Campaign and was banished to Zhangjiakou until 1962. He suffered the plight again since the Cultural Revolution began. That reversed in 1968, since he was summoned by Jiang Qing to improve a play Spark amid the Reed, namely Shajiabang. He restarted normal writing after the decade. A series of short stories were deemed to be his apogee of writing. The character of his contemporary works is portraying the rural life lyrically. These works stimulated writers of roots-searching literature in the mid- and late 1980s.  Personal life  Wang had a grasp of advanced culinary skills, he was considered to be a gourmet. This enthusiasm is also revealed in his many works, such as The Foods in my home town.

Biographical and political accounts for Jefferson now span across three centuries. Up until 1851, virtually all biographical accounts for Jefferson relied on general and common knowledge gained from official records and public writings and newspapers. It wasn't until Henry S. Randall, the first historian allowed to interview Jefferson's family, giving him access to family letters and records, did biographies of Jefferson take on a more intimate perspective. Randall wrote an 1858 three-volume biography which set the premise for many biographies that followed.Peterson, 1960, pp. 151‚Äì52; Boles, 2017, p.595See also Robert M. S. McDonald, ed. Thomas Jefferson's Lives: Biographers and the Battle for History (2019) DOI: 10.2307/j.ctvn1tbj9 online Before Randall, George Tucker produced his two-volume 1837 account of Jefferson which offered a glint of insight into Jefferson's personal life. Following Jefferson's death he was roundly criticized by the Christian Clergy for his Bible and other writings. Tucker was the first notable historian to explore Jefferson's religious life from a biographical perspective.Peterson, 1960, pp. 128‚Äì30 Though scrutinized by some historians before, during the 1960s civil rights era, historians, many of them with political and social motivations, began criticizing Jefferson for owning slaves and his racial views.Hyland, 2009 pp. 76, 119; Mayer, 2001, Essay, Chapter IV While some of their accounts were unforgiving with their often selective points of view, others have noted that Jefferson, while owning slaves and reluctant to release them into freedom unprepared, was among the first of his time to advance the idea of equality and freedom for the African descendants enslaved in the new world.Cogliano, 2006, p. 142 Many of the older biographical works are now in the public domain and often available online in their entirety in the form of e-books, while later publications whose copyrights are still valid can often be partially viewed on the internet. Jefferson overview Thomas Jefferson (April 13, 1743 ‚Äì July 4, 1826) was an American Founding Father, the principal author of the Declaration of Independence (1776) and the third President of the United States (1801‚Äì1809). He served in the Continental Congress, and as a wartime Governor of Virginia (1779‚Äì1781). From mid-1784 Jefferson served as a diplomat, stationed in Paris. In May 1785, he became the United States Minister to France. Jefferson was the first United States Secretary of State (1790‚Äì1793) serving under President George Washington. Jefferson and James Madison, organized the Democratic-Republican Party, and subsequently resigned from Washington's cabinet. Elected Vice President in 1796. He wrote the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions, which attempted to nullify the Alien and Sedition Acts. As president Jefferson promoted and authorized the Louisiana Purchase from France (1803), and sent the Lewis and Clark Expedition (1804‚Äì1806) to explore the new west. His Vice President Aaron Burr was tried for treason. Hoping to avert war he attempted economic warfare against Britain with his embargo laws. In 1807 he drafted and signed into law a bill banning the importation of slaves into the United States. Jefferson was a leader in the Enlightenment. He founded the University of Virginia after his presidency. He designed his own large mansion at Monticello and the University of Virginia building. Jefferson was a skilled writer and corresponded with many influential people in America and Europe throughout his adult life. His letters number in the many thousands and are used extensively as references for nearly all works on Jefferson. Legend Sources and publications for Jefferson have emerged for more than 200 years and at this late date there exist many hundreds of them. As such this bibliography, though extensive, is by no means complete at this time. This bibliography also contains books whose titles and subjects are not devoted to Thomas Jefferson per se, but whose content covers the subject of Jefferson well enough for their inclusion in this bibliography. Format used for listing publications: Lastname, Firstname; (1900).

It is the sequel to 1990's Hugo's House of Horrors, and is followed by 1992's Hugo III, Jungle of Doom! Plot In the game, the player controls Hugo's girlfriend, Penelope, who must investigate Uncle Horace's mysterious murder and Hugo's disappearance during a romantic getaway at her uncle's mansion. Gameplay The player moves Penelope around by using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and controls her actions by entering commands on the keyboard (or, in the later- released Windows version, one can use the mouse). The game is noted for having several puzzles that can only be solved by restarting. Reception In a retrospective 2013 review, PC Gamer expressed that while other Hugo games are short and 'not of much interest', Whodunit is \\"endearingly crazy\\". PC Gamer criticized Whodunit's numerous ways to die, and called its graphics \\"some of the laziest design ever committed to the long-suffering adventure genre\\", and noted the game as using stock clip art in several instances, which are 'jarringly different' to graphics original to the game. PC Gamer criticized Whodunit's 'unintuitive' gameplay, and puzzles & clues which feel as though the \\"designer [was] making this shit up as he went along\\", particualrly criticizing a puzzle involving the player moving Penelope over a bridge with \\"painstaking\\" and \\"pixel-perfect precision\\" to get a matchbook, and moving slightly out of the bridge's 'bad' collision detection drops the matches into a river, rendering the game unwinnable. PC Gamer heavily criticized this as \\"only [being] a puzzle because of the perspective and bad art\\", and further emphasized that Whodunit's puzzles are 'absurd' and 'unreasonable' to solve.

It is the third game in the series, following Hugo's House of Horrors (1990) and Hugo II, Whodunit? (1991). Plot In the game, the player controls the protagonist, Hugo, who must find spider venom antidote to save the life of his girlfriend, Penelope, who is bitten after their plane crashes in the South American jungle. Gameplay The player moves Hugo around by using the arrow keys on the keyboard, and controls his actions by entering commands on the keyboard (or, in the later-released Windows version, one can use the mouse). Development Artist Gary Sirois' talent for drawing trees led to the game's jungle setting. The first two Hugo games were solo projects by David P. Gray, but with Hugo III, Gray enlisted the help of computer artist Gary Sirois for the game's graphics. Sirois' talent for drawing trees led to the game taking place in a jungle. Having the graphics professionally done increased the production cost and consequently caused the game to be the shortest in the series. Gray has admitted to having confusion in geography, transposing African elements such as an elephant to the South American locale. Hugo's character design has been noted for looking similar to Indiana Jones. Gray maintains this was not intentional, though admits to perhaps a subconscious influence, going on to state that Tarzan was a greater influence. Hugo III also features a few minor technical improvements from the first two, such as a perspective system that changes Hugo's size as he moves deeper into the playing field and a hint system if players get stuck.

He is a former senior research scientist at Arnold Arboretum for 35 years and a lecturer at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. He was appointed curator of the Larz Anderson Bonsai Collection in 1982 and was editor of the journal Arnoldia from 1989 to 1992. Del Tredici, a native Californian, earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in Zoology from University of California, Berkeley in 1968 and a Master of Arts in Biology from the University of Oregon in 1969, after which he moved to Boston where he established his career and earned his doctorate in Biology from Boston University in 1991. His thesis adviser was Richard Primack and his thesis topic was \\"The Evolution and Natural History of Ginkgo biloba L.\\". Research on this project extended over a three-year period and involved travel to eastern China (fall of 1989) and to South Carolina. Del Tredici is an advocate of a \\"radically practical\\" approach to urban plant life, holding that what some people see as a collection of undesirable plants should be viewed as a valuable ecosystem unique to the hostile habitat of the city, and he prefers the term \\"spontaneous\\" over \\"invasive\\" in describing these flora. Del Tredici is the author of Wild Urban Plants of the Northeast: A Field Guide, which catalogs and describes the many species of urban wildflowers, weeds, and other plants that flourish without human support, and in which he makes the case that they can be beneficial to the quality of urban life. Del Tredici also studied the ginkgo (Ginkgo biloba) for decades. He was part of a 1989 expedition that found wild ginkgos in Tian Mu Shan Reserve, a notable find since this species had been long believed extinct in the wild.It is not undisputed that these are truly wild, as the population shows a relative genetic uniformity that could indicate that they were planted and preserved by Chinese monks over a long period (See ), but later research by Wei Gong has indicated that the find likely was of wild trees. He demonstrated that gingko basal lignotubers develop from suppressed cotyledonary (embryonic leaf) buds ‚Äì a resprouting mechanism activated under stress that, according to Del Tredici, helps explain the gingko's long survival as a species. He helped develop supporting evidence for the theory that the ginkgo's characteristic vile‚Äìsmelling fruits are a mechanism to attract ingestion by carnivores, aiding the tree's propagation via scat, and developed experiments confirming that all aspects of the ginkgo's sexual reproductive cycle are strongly influenced by temperature. Del Tredici also consulted for a French subsidiary of Schwabe Pharmaceutical which markets gingko‚Äìleaf extract as a memory aid. While Del Tredici applied his expertise on the botanical side of the operation, he was skeptical that the products are effective, and noted that rather than deriving from ancient Chinese medical wisdom, the idea of gingko as an effective health agent \\"began in a board room in Germany in the mid‚Äì1960s\\" and has resulted in \\"a big cash cow\\". In 2013, Del Tredici was awarded a Veitch Memorial Medal, given by the Royal Horticultural Society for outstanding contribution to the advancement of the science, art, or practice of horticulture. Publications Del Tredici has published scholarly articles in various journals, edited or co‚Äìedited books, and contributed sections to books.

Education Maxwell graduated from Pacific Union College in 1956 with degrees in theology and biblical languages. He went on to pursue a Master of Arts degree at Andrews University in systematic theology. After completing his Master of Arts, he pursued a doctorate in biblical studies specializing in the New Testament at New Jersey's Drew University. While there, he was named a Rockefeller Fellow and Drew University Scholar. Personal life The youngest of four sons of Arthur S. Maxwell, of Uncle Arthur fame, Maxwell met his wife, Eileen, in 1955 while still a student at Pacific Union College. They were married for 52 years until her death in April 2007. Educator Maxwell taught in the theology departments of Union College and then Walla Walla College before being selected chair of the department, and later, dean in Walla Walla's School of Theology. In 1978 he became the Vice President for Academic Administration at Walla Walla until 1981 when he returned to teach in the theology department, where he taught until accepting an opportunity to serve as President of Pacific Union College. President of Pacific Union College In June 1983, Malcolm Maxwell became president of Pacific Union College. He was the first alumnus of the school to serve as president. At the time, the school was facing a crisis of confidence due to controversies which erupted under the previous administration. As president, Maxwell immediately addressed the controversy and set out on a mission to rebuild confidence in the school. A prodigious fundraiser, he focussed much of his efforts in that area. Within two years of his arrival on campus, the school completed construction of the science complex and Chan Shun Hall, a previously stalled building project. As president, he was noted for his \\"ready smile, down-to- earth advice, and folksy family\\" speeches. Upon retirement from an 18-year tenure as president in 2001, Maxwell became the first president to be designated president emeritus by the Pacific Union College Board. Retirement and death Following his retirement from the Presidency in 2001, Maxwell continued as a Professor in the Religion Department at Pacific Union College until 2006. Following his full retirement in April 2007, Maxwell and his wife, Eileen, were in the process of moving to Scottsdale, Arizona when his wife Eileen died. He soon came down with Lou Gehrig disease which moved with dismaying speed until his death at the age of 73 in October of the same year.

She established various health clinics throughout Puerto Rico and was the founder of The Association of Registered Nurses of Puerto Rico. In 1929, Gonzalez wrote a book titled \\"Los Hechos Desconocidos\\" (The Unknown Facts), in which she denounced the discrimination against women and nurses in Puerto Rico. Gonz√°lez‚Äôs book convinced James R. Beverley, the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico, to sign Ley 77 (Law 77) in May 1930, which established a Nurses Examining Board. In 1978, she was the first recipient of the Public Health Department of Puerto Rico Garrido Morales Award. Early years Gonz√°lez (birth name: Rosa Ang√©lica Gonz√°lez) was born and raised in the town of Lares, Puerto Rico. There she received her primary and secondary education. She was still a child when Spain ceded Puerto Rico to the United States in accordance with the agreement reached in the 1898 Treaty of Paris, which officially ended the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Salud Promujer 1 She attended the Congressional day school and converted to Protestantism when she was nine years old. Her father, a small merchant, suddenly died when she was just a child and she went to live with her aunt and uncle. While she was attending public secondary school she learned that the Presbyterian Hospital of Puerto Rico needed nurses. She became interested in pursuing a career in nursing despite the protests of her family. Gonz√°lez enrolled in the Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where she earned her nurse certificate in 1909. In 1914, she went to New York City and continued her studies and earned the title of Registered Nurse at the New York Presbyterian Hospital.\\"LA MUJER EN LAS PROFESIONES DE SALUD (1898-1930); By: YAMILA AZIZE VARGAS1 and LUIS ALBERTO AVILES; PRHSJ Vol, 9 No. 1 Return to Puerto Rico In 1916, Gonz√°lez returned to her homeland and organized the Dr. Susoni clinic in the city of Arecibo.

Under her leadership the association was able to raise enough funds for the construction of a building to house the Club de Nurses, where convalescent nurses could reside.\\"Lideres en Enfermeria en Puerto Rico; Rosa Ang√©lica Gonz√°lez\\"; by: Tiffany Ramos In 1917, Gonz√°lez wrote her first book Diccionario M√©dico para la Enfermera (Nurse's Medical Dictionary). In 1918, the Swine Flu swept through Army camps and training posts around the world including Puerto Rico, infecting one quarter of all soldiers and killing more than 55,000 American troops.Carol R. Byerly, Fever of War, (New York University Press, 2005), 6-10. Gonz√°lez was sent to Ponce, Puerto Rico, where she assisted Dr. Dolores Pi√±ero and four male colleagues, when they opened a 400-bed hospital to care for infected patients and World War I veterans. Gonz√°lez served as the voluntary Director of Emergency Unit in the city of Mayag√ºez, helping the victims of the San Ferm√≠n earthquake. From 1919 to 1924 Gonz√°lez was the Director of Puerto Rico's Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing. During this time (1921), she traveled to New York and attended Columbia University. After leaving the Presbyterian Hospital she became director of the nursing at the Hospital Episcopal San Lucas (St. Lukes Hospital) in Ponce. While there she organized the nursing program and finally published her ‚ÄúDiccionario Medico para Enfermeras‚Äù, which she had written in 1917. In 1924, she worked as an educator and trainer of nurses for the Sanitation Department of Puerto Rico. In 1925, she was named director of the American Red Cross dispensary in the barrio of Puerta de Tierra in Santurce. She was hired by the mayor of San Juan, Roberto H. Todd Weels, to organize the nursing school in Santurce and named the Executive Secretary of the Association of Graduated Nurses of Puerto Rico. In 1926, Gonz√°lez founded a magazine for nurses called Puerto Rico.. She publicly criticized the deplorable conditions of the municipal hospital and was fired in 1927, by the mayor on the false accusation that she signed diplomas for nursing students who had not completed their clinical training requirements. She denied the charges but, was unable to sue the city because a law at the time forbade municipal employees from suing the city.Advancing The Kingdom Missionaries And Americanization In Puerto Rico, 1898 ‚Äì 1930s; By: Ellen Walsh; Pages 171-188; Publisher: ProQuest, UMI Dissertation Publishing; ; Nurses Examining Board In 1929, Gonz√°lez wrote a book titled Los Hechos Desconocidos (The Unknown Facts), which she dedicated to the Governor of Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican Legislature and the Medical Association. The book was also dedicated to the Puerto Rican Nurses Association and the Association of Puerto Rican Women Surrogates. In her book she denounced the corruption, abuses and unhealthy practices in the municipal hospital. Gonz√°lez used her book to promote the establishment of a Nurse Examiners Board in Puerto Rico. As a Women‚Äôs Rights activist, she also denounced the discriminatory practices against women in the health care professions. Gonz√°lez‚Äôs book convinced James R. Beverley, the Interim Governor of Puerto Rico, to sign Ley 77 (Law 77) in May 1930. Previously the Medical Board, which was made up of male doctors who regulated nursing matters, had pressured the Governor not to sign the bill into law. This was because if the bill became law it would establish a Nurses Examining Board responsible for setting and enforcing standards of nursing education and practices. Gonz√°lez believed that the \\"Medical Class\\" discriminated against female nurses and stated this clearly in her book: The law (Ley 77), influenced by Gonz√°lez‚Äôs written work, also stipulated that the Board of Medical Examiners include two nurses and established the Nurse Examiners Board. The passage of Ley 77 proved that women can operate both in the formal public sphere while working in a female oriented field. Founder of medical institutions in Puerto Rico Amongst the institutions which she organized were the Amarosa Sanitarium in the town of Villalba (1929), the school of the Institute of Medical Surgery (1930), and the nursing school on the grounds of the School of Tropical Medicine in San Juan (1931). Dr. Clarence Gamble, an American physician, established a network of birth control clinics in Puerto Rico during the period of 1936 to 1939. He believed that Puerto Rican women and the women from other American colonies did not have the mental capacity and were too poor to understand and use diaphragms for birth control as those in the United States mainland. He inaugurated a program funded by the Rockefeller Foundation which would replace the use of diaphragms with foam powders, cremes and spermicidal jellies. He did not know that in the past Gonzalez had publicly battled with prominent physicians and named Gonz√°lez and Carmen Rivera de Alvarez, another nurse who was a Puerto Rican independence advocate, to take charge of the insular birth control program. Gonz√°lez organized and, from 1936 to 1940, headed the first clinic dedicated to maternal health in her hometown of Lares. However, the insular program lacked funding and failed.Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico When the United States entered World War II, Gonz√°lez was named Director of the Nurses Services of the American Red Cross in Puerto Rico. Legacy In 1978, Gonz√°lez became the first recipient of the Garrido Morales award, an honor bestowed upon her by the Governing Board of the Association of Public Health in Puerto Rico. She continued to provide medical services free of charge for the children in Guaynabo where she resided. She died in her home on July 25, 1981 . The Salud Pro-Mujer (Pro-Woman's Health) organization named an award the \\"ROSA GONZALEZ AWARD\\" which recognizes health professionals who have contributed to improving the health of women.Salud Pro-Mujer Further reading *Further reading: Reproducing Empire: Race, Sex, Science, and U.S. Imperialism in Puerto Rico; By Laura Briggs; Publisher: University of California Press; ; *Advancing The Kingdom Missionaries And Americanization In Puerto Rico, 1898 ‚Äì 1930s; By: Ellen Walsh; Publisher: ProQuest, UMI Dissertation Publishing; ; See also *List of Puerto Ricans *History of women in Puerto Rico References Category:1889 births Category:1981 deaths Category:Puerto Rican nurses Category:People from Lares, Puerto Rico Category:Puerto Rican activists Category:Puerto Rican women activists Category:Puerto Rican writers ","title":"Rosa A.

It is the directorial debut for Provost. Plot A young woman (Mira Sorvino) arrives at a cabin in an isolated forest in a small island inhabited by the apparition of a man (Shane West) whom she cannot see or hear, and who cannot leave the cabin. The Ghost, although undisturbed, is curious about her and starts watching her, something that she starts to perceive faintly. After a few days, her boyfriend (Justin Kirk) joins her unannounced and, although surprised, she happily shows her around. She brings him to an elevated spot with a broad view of the area that she claims was a favourite of her when she was a child. The Man suddenly proposes to her, and noticing that she is confused and full of doubt, bids her to keep the engagement ring and think about it. At that moment, he loses his balance and nearly falls off, as she rushes to pull him back to safety. The event changes her mind and she accepts his proposal; however, the ring seems to have been lost in the accident. The same day, while the woman is busy with work and her boyfriend is cooking dinner, the Ghost perceives whispers and, watching her, notices another ghost dressed in black (Tony Curran) who sits very close to her and feeds her with ill words about her relationship, as she apparently cannot see him either but receives his words all the same. The Ghost in Black notices the other ghost and approaches him, proposing to aid him to escape his limited supernatural existence in exchange for his help. The first Ghost notices that the other one‚Äôs words affect her, turning her cold and hostile and causing her to snap to her boyfriend. Later that night, the Ghost notices the Ghost in Black sitting between the couple and talking to both in the same secret way, furthermore increasing the tension between them. The following day, the man seeks to discuss things with her, which angers her and makes her break the engagement. This causes him to be upset and decide to leave, which she says he cannot do as they can only leave the island on a boat that only comes occasionally unless summoned. He attempts to call and finds out that the cell phone is dead. Later, the man makes ready to leave, but before he can do so he tries to look for her, and discovers that she is missing. He goes outside and remembers an opening that she had showed her upon his arrival which leads to the space underneath the cabin, into which he crawls. The woman, back in herself after reflecting on things and finding the engagement ring, returns to the cabin hoping to mend things, and finds that he packed his things but cannot determine whether he has departed. She feels the presence of the ghost and questions him about her boyfriend, to which he answers by knocking loudly and informing her that her partner has not left. She crawls into the space underneath the cabin herself and finds him lying unconscious and injured. The Ghost in Black, after threatening the other Ghost for having helped her, reveals himself to her and urges her to smash her partner‚Äôs head with a rock, which she seems resolute to do, before she stops and defies the ghost. She goes back outside to call for help, but the Ghost in Black keeps standing in her way. Before he can harm her, he notices some other presence behind him; he then turns around and screams in terror while she escapes. She retreats into the cabin, where the first Ghost is standing still unseen. He then screams, which makes her notice him and realize that he was never against her. The third presence (Deobia Oparei) enters the cabin; it is revealed in flashbacks that this third Ghost has benignly aided the couple, both saving the man from falling off and later placing the ring for her to find. He rescues the Ghost from his existence and both disappear. Mr. Browman (Muse Watson), a townsman, appears at the door and tells her that he came because he had a feeling that something was wrong and had tried unsuccessfully to communicate with her. They bring her boyfriend out from under the house and take him away on his boat so he can receive medical assistance. As they leave, another silent presence can be seen sitting next to Mr Browman.

Apollinaris (died 515) was a count of Auvergne who led a auvergnat army for the Visigoths in the Battle of Vouill√©, and was bishop of Clermont for four months before his death.  Life  Apollinaris was the son of the aristocrat and poet Sidonius Apollinaris and Papianilla. A number of contemporary Romano-Gallic aristocrats were his cousins, including bishops Avitus of Vienne and Ruricius of Limoges. Our earliest records of Apollinaris are in the letters of his father Sidonius. Although Apollinaris is the recipient of one letter (Epistulae III.13), E.H. Warmington considers it a \\"show-piece\\" which was never actually sent to him.Sidonius: Poems and Letters (Cambridge: Loeb Classical Library, 1965), vol. 2 p. 47 n.* Sidonius mentions Apollinaris in several of his letters: two allude to his youth (in V.11, he describes Apollinaris as \\"in these budding years of manhood\\", and in V.9 hopes that Apollinaris would have children), another mentions Apollinaris' love of hunting,Epistulae VIII.6; translated in Anderson, Sidonius, vol. 2 p. 429 and in the last laments his disinterest in literature.Epistulae IX.1; translated in Anderson, Sidonius, vol. 2 p. 503 Despite his father's opinion, Apollinaris did at least once display an interest in literature: according to a letter of Ruricius, he helped to distribute his father's writings.Epistulae 2.26; translated by Ralph W. Mathisen, Ruricius of Limoges and Friends: A Collection of Letters from Visigothic Gaul (Liverpool: University Press, 1999), pp. 183-185. Mathisen considers it \\"a more intriguing possibility\\" that the writings Apollinaris sent to Ruricius were Sidonius' now-lost sermons. After the Visigothic capture of Clermont, Apollinaris fled the town with comes Victorius to Italy; there Victorius was killed, and Apollinaris was taken captive, but managed to escape with his servant and return home.Gregory of Tours, Glory of the Martyrs, translated by Raymond Van Dam (Liverpool: University Press, 2004), pp. 43f Apollinaris apparently got along with king Alaric II far better than Alaric's predecessor, for Gregory of Tours records that Apollinaris led a militia raised in Clermont on the Visigothic side of the Battle of Vouill√© in 507.Gregory of Tours, Decem Libri Historiarum, II.37; translated by Lewis Thorpe, History of the Franks (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974), p. 154 Although several letters written to him from his other cousin, bishop Avitus of Vienne, are dated to the years after that battle,Epistulae 24, 36, 51, 52; translated by Dauta Shanzer and Ian Wood, Avitus of Vienne, Letters and Selected Prose (Liverpool: University Press, 2002), pp. 337-340, 342-349 Apollinaris' activities until 515 are unknown. In that year, with the help of his sister Alcima and his wife Placidana, he was appointed bishop of Clermont by the Frankish king Theuderic I.

Pharmacology UR-144 has high affinity for the CB2 receptor with a Ki of 1.8 nM but 83x lower affinity for the CB1 receptor with a Ki of 150 nM. UR-144 was found to possess an EC50 of 421 nM for human CB1 receptors, and 72 nM for human CB2 receptors.

Originally a teacher, he fought against the Ottomans army and later Bulgarian guerrilla bands in the Kosovo Vilayet. Life Doksim was born in Galiƒçnik, a Mijak village. He finished the theological school in Prizren, and was a teacher in his home region until 1904, when he joined the Serbian Chetnik Organization. In January 1905, vojvoda Gligor Sokoloviƒá sent Stefan Nediƒá-ƒÜela from Babuna to Vranje to bring new Chetniks and Doksim. He was one of many teachers who were voivodes. He participated in the Battle of ƒåelopek (1905), which had been glorified as a great victory. In 1906 he lost his teacher wage. After the guerrilla war, he went to Mount Athos, where he worked as the estate manager of the Hilandar. He returned to Macedonia and married, then worked as a principal at Serbian schools in Gevgelija. After that, he went to Greece and Malta and worked in trade; Doksim spoke Greek and Turkish since youth, and later taught Arabic and Italian. When the First Balkan War started, he immediately took up arms and founded his own band, and joined vojvoda Vojin Popoviƒá-Vuk, at the front of the Serbian Army. Prior to the start of the First Balkan War, Chetniks gathered in Vranje from several regions: 160 in Vranje and 30 on the Kozjak with the voivodes Babunski, ƒÜela, Dolgaƒç, Trpko, Dane, Vanƒëel, Doksim and Cakiƒá; there were also 60 Chetniks which readied for Poreƒçe, led by Vojvoda Vuk. These bands were the first to have crossed the border, cleaned the ground, built bridges and prepared important positions such as Kozjak, Stracin, and others. Doksim fought the Ottomans at Kozjak. The bands were also accompanied by armed peasants, thus numbering four groups of around 250 men. The Chetniks were the first to enter Prilep, then fought in the front lines in the battles for Bitola and Kiƒçevo. Doksim died on the second day of the battle of Kumanovo. He was buried on a hill above the village of Mlado Nagoriƒçane.

He also served as the Senior Minister of State in the Ministry for Law and Ministry for Health from 1 July 2018 to his promotions in 27 July 2020. Additionally, he has served as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Marine Parade GRC for Joo Chiat since 11 September 2015. Biography Tong was educated at St. Michael's School and St. Joseph's Institution. He read law at the National University of Singapore, graduating in 1994. After admission to the Singapore Bar, he joined Allen & Gledhill LLP where he was a partner until 2018. He is a Roman Catholic. Political career Tong's political involvement commenced with grassroots work with various incumbent Members of Parliament and constituencies, especially the now defunct Jalan Besar GRC. Tong was fielded by the People's Action Party (PAP) as a candidate in the group representation constituency of the newly formed Moulmein‚ÄìKallang GRC in the 2011 General Election. He was elected, with the team garnering 44,828 votes or 58.56% of the total votes cast. Tong previously served as a Member of Parliament for the sub-electoral division of Jalan Besar, but it has since been split up and merged with Kolam Ayer, Kampong Glam and Whampoa in 2015. Tong ran in Marine Parade GRC against the Workers Party in the 2015 General Election and was elected with 67.02% of the vote. Tong represented Pastor Kong Hee of the City Harvest Church in the City Harvest Church Trial. On 5 February 2018, the Singapore Attorney- General's Chamber said it would take action against a man for contempt of court for publishing on a Facebook group a doctored image of Chinese tabloid Lianhe Wanbao, insinuating that Edwin Tong and his affiliated political party had saved Kong Hee from harsher penalties. The original title of the Chinese paper had used the word \\"outdated law\\" instead of \\"PAP lawyer\\", to describe the reason behind Kong's relatively light penalties. Tong is also a member of the select committee set up to look into tackling the issue of online falsehoods. In March 2018 at the committee hearings, Tong led evidence from freelance journalist Kirsten Han, whose submission to the select committee centered on Singapore's tight control on civil liberties, and who clarified that she was one of the 34 interviewees who contributed to the Human Rights Watch Report on Singapore in 2017. Han acknowledged that her article titled \\"Singapore plays up terrorism to curb liberties\\" was ‚Äúincomplete at the very least, and possibly misleading at the other end of the spectrum‚Äù. In banter with Han, he seemed to allude to the possibility that those who similarly post misleading articles may eventually be subjected to litigation. On 1 July 2018, Tong was appointed as Senior Minister of State for Law and Health.

Life Son of a merchant, he studied medicine with Luigi Galvani in Bologna and Johann Peter Frank in Pavia whom he followed to Vienna in 1795 and with whom he competed as the secondary doctor at the Vienna general hospital. He finished his training in 1787 and founded the society of general practitioners in 1802 and founded his own practice in 1804. In 1809 he published his work of natural philosophy, \\"Draft pathogeny of Evolution and Revolution of Life.\\" During the Congress of Vienna he enjoyed an excellent reputation and became the personal physician of Archduke Karl and Archduchess Maria Beatrice d'Este of Modena. On December 31, 1821 he married Polish countess Helena Ostrowska (1794‚Äì1826). In 1822 the couple bore their first daughter and the Archduchess served as Godmother. The archduchess also granted him a pension for life. In 1830 he was also consulted by Franz, Duke of Reichstadt (\\"Napoleon II\\"). His house on K√ºniglberg, a hill in Heitzing, now a suburb of Vienna, inspired Malfatti to take the title, \\"Count of Monteregio,\\" and he was awarded this title on April 10, 1837 for his contributions to medical science. Haus Malfatti, his residence in Vienna's Weinhaus neighborhood Ludwig van Beethoven first made Malfatti's acquaintance in 1809 and consulted him several times in the following years. In 1811, Malfatti advised Beethoven to take a cure in Teplitz. Beethoven composed his cantata WoO 103 Un lieto brindisi for the Malfatti's name day celebration on June 24, 1814 held at Malfatti's house in Vienna's Weinhaus neighborhood. In 1817 the relationship suffered a rupture on account of Beethoven's frequent mistrust of others. Beethoven only consulted with Malfatti ten years later during his last illness, but the Malfatti did not meet Beethoven's hopes for a cure. Malfatti brought, together with his colleague Franz von Wirer, promoted the development of the great Austrian spas such as Bad Ischl and Bad V√∂slau. He engaged in personal contact with the philosophers Franz Xaver von Baader and Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling, the naturalist Lorenz Oken, and the medical philosopher Ignaz Paul Vital Troxler. He was buried in an honored grave in the Heitzinger cemetery, and the Malfattisteig in Vienna's Hietzing is named for him.

It lives in a tube built of sand, gravel and pieces of shell. Description S. spinulosa lives in a tube made of shell fragments and coarse sand cemented together with mucus. The tube has a circular cross section and can be closed by an operculum formed by bristles growing on the head of the worm. There are several thoracic segments and the abdomen has many segments that have hooked bristles on raised lobes. The worm's distinguishing features include three thoracic segments with paired chaetal sheaths, pointed opercular chaetae and an outer layer of serrated chaetae.Ross worm - Sabellaria spinulosa. Marine Life Information Network. Retrieved 2011-11-03.NIWA Guide to Polychaeta Retrieved 2011-11-04. Distribution S. spinulosa is found round the coasts of the British Isles, in the sublittoral zone and occasionally in the intertidal zone. It is also found in other regions of the north east Atlantic Ocean south to Portugal and the Mediterranean Sea. Biology S. spinulosa is a filter feeder, extending its feeding tentacles to catch plankton and detritus that are brought within its reach by the current. Individual worms are either male or female. In the English Channel, spawning mostly takes place between January and March and the larvae became part of the zooplankton. Development of the larvae take 4 to 8 weeks before they settle and undergo metamorphosis and start building tubes. The worms live for 2 to 5 years, or possibly for as long as 9 years. The worms are very tolerant of adverse conditions such as polluted water, low salinity or low oxygen levels. They favour localities where currents or waves churn up sand but they need a hard substrate to get established. The larvae are strongly attracted to settle in areas where adults are already living or other larvae have settled, but if, after 2 months, the larvae have not found such a place, they settle independently.Wilson, D.P. 1970. The larvae of Sabellaria spinulosa and their settlement behaviour, Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 50, 33-52. Shells of the scallop Pecten maximus also attracted larvae to a lesser extent. Larvae of S. alveolata were attracted to settle near adult S. spinulosa but not vice versa. Ecology S. spinulosa usually lives singly in a tube attached to the substrate over its entire length. In much of its range it does not forms reefs in the same way as the closely related honeycomb worm, Sabellaria alveolata. When the worms are crowded together the tubes may stand up vertically and form crusts or mounds several metres across. Unaggregated individuals may reach densities of 300 per square metre (10sq ft), and densities of 4000 individuals per square metre have been recorded in loose aggregations.George, C.L. & Warwick, R.M. 1985. Annual macrofauna production in a hard-bottom reef community. Journal of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, 65, 713-735. However, under a narrow set of environmental circumstances, reefs are formed. These include: sand or gravel sea floor, the edges of sandbanks, the edges of channels and drop-offs, high turbidity, high sediment load, moderate currents and moderate suspended organic particulate load. Where reefs exist, they provide a biodiverse habitat for a large number of invertebrates and juvenile fish. They are often dominated by the presence of crustaceans, especially the porcelain crab (Pisidia longicornis) and the pink shrimp (Pandalus montagui), which feed on the worms and on other invertebrates which shelter in the reefs.Best methods for identifying and evaluating Sabellaria spinulosa and cobble reef Retrieved 2011-11-04. Another frequent resident is the queen scallop (Aequipecten opercularis). The reefs are at risk from trawling and other human activities that disturb the seabed.

This concept is similar to the concept of geometrical optics, or ray optics, that studies light propagation in terms of rays. Geometrical acoustics is the approximate theory, which is valid in the limiting case of very small acoustic wavelengths, or very high frequencies. The principal task of geometrical acoustics is to determine the trajectories of sound rays. The rays have the simplest form in a homogeneous medium, where they are straight lines. If the acoustic parameters of the medium are functions of spatial coordinates, the ray trajectories become curvilinear, describing sound reflection, refraction, possible focusing, etc. The equations of geometric acoustics have essentially the same form as those of geometric optics. The same laws of reflection and refraction hold for sound rays as for light rays. Geometrical acoustics does not take into account such important wave effects as diffraction. However, it provides a very good approximation when the wavelength is very small compared to the characteristic dimensions of inhomogeneous inclusions through which the sound propagates. Mathematical description The below discussion is from Landau and Lifshitz.Landau, L. D., & Sykes, J. B. (1987). Fluid Mechanics: Vol 6. If the amplitude and the direction of propagation varies slowly over the distances of wavelength, then an arbitrary sound wave can be approximated locally as a plane wave. In this case, the velocity potential can be written as :\\\\phi = \\\\mathrm{e}^{\\\\mathrm{i}\\\\psi} For plane wave \\\\psi = \\\\boldsymbol{k}\\\\cdot\\\\boldsymbol{r} - \\\\omega t + \\\\alpha, where \\\\boldsymbol{k} is a constant wavenumber vector, \\\\omega is a constant frequency, \\\\boldsymbol{r} is the radius vector, t is the time and \\\\alpha is some arbitrary complex constant. The function \\\\psi is called the eikonal. We expect the eikonal to vary slowly with coordinates and time consistent with the approximation, then in that case, a Taylor series expansion provides :\\\\psi = \\\\psi_o + \\\\boldsymbol{r}\\\\cdot\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{r}} + t \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t}. Equating the two terms for \\\\psi, one finds :\\\\boldsymbol{k} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{r}}, \\\\quad \\\\omega = - \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t} For sound waves, the relation \\\\omega^2 = c^2 k^2 holds, where c is the speed of sound and k is the magnitude of the wavenumber vector. Therefore, the eikonal satisfies a first order nonlinear partial differential equation, :\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial x}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial y}\\\\right)^2 + \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial z}\\\\right)^2 -\\\\frac{1}{c^2} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\psi}{\\\\partial t}\\\\right)^2 =0. where c can be a function of coordinates if the fluid is not homogeneous. The above equation is same as Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation where the eikonal can be considered as the action. Since Hamilton‚ÄìJacobi equation is equivalent to Hamilton's equations, by analogy, one finds that :\\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{k}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = -\\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\omega}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{r}}, \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\mathrm{d}\\\\boldsymbol{r}}{\\\\mathrm{d}t} = \\\\frac{\\\\partial \\\\omega}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{k}} Practical applications Practical applications of the methods of geometrical acoustics can be found in very different areas of acoustics. For example, in architectural acoustics the rectilinear trajectories of sound rays make it possible to determine reverberation time in a very simple way. The operation of fathometers and hydrolocators is based on measurements of the time required for sound rays to travel to a reflecting object and back. The ray concept is used in designing sound focusing systems. Also, the approximate theory of sound propagation in inhomogeneous media (such as the ocean and the atmosphere) has been developed largely on the basis of the laws of geometrical acoustics.Urick, Robert J. Principles of Underwater Sound, 3rd Edition. New York. McGraw-Hill, 1983.C. H. Harrison, Ocean propagation models, Applied Acoustics 27, 163-201 (1989). The methods of geometrical acoustics have a limited range of applicability because the ray concept itself is only valid for those cases where the amplitude and direction of a wave undergo little changes over distances of the order of wavelength of a sound wave. More specifically, it is necessary that the dimensions of the rooms or obstacles in the sound path should be much greater than the wavelength. If the characteristic dimensions for a given problem become comparable to the wavelength, then wave diffraction begins to play an important part, and this is not covered by geometric acoustics. Software applications The concept of geometrical acoustics is widely used in software applications. Some software applications that use geometrical acoustics for their calculations are ODEON, Enhanced Acoustic Simulator for Engineers, and Olive Tree Lab Terrain.

Randolph College (founded at Randolph-Macon Women's College) has been collecting American art since 1907 and the Maier Museum of Art now houses its collection of several thousand American paintings, prints, drawings, and photographs from the 19th and 21st centuries. The Maier hosts an active schedule of special exhibitions and education programs throughout the year. Through its programs, internships, museum studies practicums, and class visits, the Maier Museum of Art provides valuable learning opportunities for Randolph students and the community at large.  History  Randolph-Macon Women's College, founded by William Waugh Smith, was the first women‚Äôs college in the south. Smith gained support for the College from the River Mont Land Company who donated 20 acres of land in what is now the city Lynchburg, Virginia. Smith raised $100,000 from 150 local residents and founded the College on March 10, 1891, welcoming the first class in 1893 with 36 female students and 12 professors. The art collection was established when the senior class of 1907 commissioned a portrait from William Meritt Chase of William Waugh Smith, the first president of Randolph-Macon Women's College (now Randolph College). In 1911, Louise Jordan Smith, the college‚Äôs first professor of art, established an annual exhibition of contemporary art. Since then, the College has purchased at least one work of art the each annual exhibition to add to its collection. In 2007, Randolph‚ÄìMacon Women‚Äôs College became co-ed and was renamed Randolph College.  Annual Exhibition of Contemporary Art  An early champion of American Art, the College's first professor of art, Louise Jordan Smith, realized that while she couldn‚Äôt take her students to New York, she could bring art to them. To this end, in 1911, Louise Jordan Smith established an annual exhibition of contemporary art on campus. Since then, the College's art collection has grown through acquisitions of artwork from the series of exhibitions, including works by Winslow Homer, Gilbert Stewart, Mary Cassatt, Milton Avery, Georgia O‚ÄôKeeffe, Edward Hopper.  Project Y  In 1951, the National Gallery of Art established a secret emergency repository (code named \\"Project Y\\") for its distinguished collection of art on the campus of Randolph-Macon Woman's College (now Randolph College). The specially designed reinforced concrete building, situated at the end of Quinlan Street, was built for use in the event of national crisis during the Cold War. In exchange for ownership and use of the facility, the college made it available to the National Gallery for 50 years for emergency purposes. The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust financed its construction. The structure was finished in the spring of 1952 costing under $250,000 to build and was simply called ‚Äúthe art gallery.‚Äù A pre-staged convoy of trucks in the National Gallery of Art‚Äôs garage stood at the ready to evacuate its masterpieces to the facility which included a fully stocked, three-bedroom cottage for the gallery‚Äôs curator. In the mid-1970s, the College was granted permission by the National Gallery of Art to renovate the space to make it more practical, attractive and comfortable for the students, faculty and the public. The renovations were funded by the National Endowment for the Arts. After subsequent renovations in 1981-82 and the established of an endowment in 1983, funded by the Sarah and Pauline Maier Scholarship Foundation, the name was changed from ‚Äúthe art gallery‚Äù to its present name, the Maier Museum of Art. Art controversies In 2007, Randolph College announced that it would sell four paintings from its collection. The announcement resulted in an injunction filed to stop the sales as well as protests from art associations, including the Virginia Association of Museums, the Association of Art Museum Directors and the College Art Association. The lawsuit was dropped. In 2008, the college sold Rufino Tamayo's Trovador for a record-breaking $7.2 million. In 2013, Randolph College entered into an agreement with the National Gallery, London for the purchase of George Wesley Bellows' Men of the Docks, for $25.5 million and established an academic partnership between the two institutions. The other paintings sold at a later date are Edward Hicks' Peaceable Kingdom, and Ernest Hennings' Through the Arroyo (which remains on campus through a loan). In the spring of 2011, Randolph College was censured by the Association of Art Museum Directors (AAMD), of which Randolph College is not nor has ever been a member, for its proposed deaccessioning of four centerpieces within its collection. The college responded by asserting that its art collection is a college asset held for the purpose of enhancing student learning. In 2014, the AAMD issued sanctions forbidding its member institutions from loaning artwork to or otherwise collaborating with the Maier Museum of Art at Randolph College. The censure has sparked discussion over the differences between standalone museums and collections held by private non-profit entities like colleges and universities.

Although earlier rappers from other Scandinavian countries were allowed, now the battle is confined solely to Danish rappers making it the definitive freestyle rap competition for rap in Denmark. The event consists of \\"verbal battles\\" (i.e. games) between two rappers placed in a boxing ring and battles are done via microphones (hence the name MC, short for Microphone Controller). Those resorting to physical violence are disqualified. Finalists are decided after auditions held in various cities where hundreds of rappers apply. Judges eliminate one of the two contestants in 1/8 finals, quarterfinals, semifinals and the final finale. Each \\"battle\\" is limited to two laps of 1 minute on a particular subject. In the final, an extra free third round is added. Those attending usually determining results. But in case of wide disagreements or split voting, the judges determine the winner in boxing style. The winner is crowned \\"MC's Fight Night Champ\\", while the rapper with the best monologue during the evening receives the \\"Den Gyldne Mikrofon\\" (The Golden Microphone) (also known as √Örets Punchline Award). In addition to cash prizes (on a winner takes all basis - no prizes for runners-up), a championship belt was added as an additional reward in 2004 carrying names of all previous champions. The event has attracted increasing attendance which has prompted the event organizers to switch the venue from Amager Bio with capacity of 800 where the earlier battles were held to Cirkusbygningen that accommodated 2000 people. In 2005 the organizers moved the event again to an even larger venue at KB Hallen, that could accommodate 4000 people.

Description  Commodore 1351 mouse The Commodore 1351 is similar in appearance to the mouse supplied with Commodore Amiga computers of the time, but the two are not mutually compatible. (A quick way to identify is to look at the plug. The Amiga mouse has a thinner plug which looks like regular joystick connectors.) In its default mode, it is a true proportional mouse, but by holding down the right mouse button when powering up the machine, it can be made to emulate its predecessor, the 1350 (which while physically a mouse acted electrically like a joystick). The 1351 utilizes the 6581/8580 SID chip's analog-to-digital converter, thus it is only compatible with the C64/C128 and will not work on the VIC-20 despite using the same 9-pin connector. An Amiga mouse, although electrically compatible with the C64, uses the paddle registers and will be much more CPU-intensive to read than the 1351. A few programs such as Interpaint support Amiga mice. The mouse was distributed with a user manual containing maintenance instructions, pinouts, and sample BASIC and machine language programs for the Commodore 64 and 128. Also included was a diskette containing diagnostic tools, demos, drivers, and an upgrade for the GEOS operating system. The first mouse released for the C64 was the NEOS Mouse in 1985 by the company Nihon Electronics Co. Ltd., however it was quickly superseded when Commodore introduced their own mouse the following year. A handful of drawing programs, GEOS, and the C64 port of Arkanoid can use the NEOS Mouse.  Reception  The 1351 was favorably reviewed by The Transactor, which praised the unit's ergonomic design and tactile feedback and the quality of the accompanying documentation. The reviewer noted that, at the time of writing, very little commercial software supported the 1351 in proportional mode, but suggested that the mouse would be of benefit in joystick mode in drawing programs, font and sprite editors, and certain kinds of games. Software that can use a 1351 mouse includes GEOS, The Faery Tale Adventure, Operation Wolf, and assorted application/drawing programs.

Early life It is said that his parents had been childless for a long time before his birth. The tradition holds that when Devi Sahab was nearly four years of age, Sant Tulsi Sahab visited his house again and prophesied that he would one day turn into a great sant. Later life Baba Devi Sahab lived a simple life as a postal clerk while practicing his spiritual discipline. He voluntarily retired early and lived his latter years in Moradabad in the state of Uttar Pradesh. He was a kind teacher and had a large following. Baba Devi Sahab says: Spiritual mission Baba Devi Sahab took forward and enriched the spiritual legacy of Sant Tulsi Sahab of Hathras (U.P.) by holding Satsangs and propagating the message of Santmat to different portions of the Northern and the erstwhile North-Western India that included parts of what is now Pakistan. He eventually located his Ashram, base camp, at Moradabad/Muradabad, Uttar Pradesh. However, before that he is said to have spent a few years at Agra also where, it is said, he attended Satsang of Rai Bahadur Shaligram Ji (Hazur Rai Saligram Bahadur, later popularly also known as Huzur/Hazur Maharaj) who was the successor of Sant Radhaswami Sahab. Padma Das Ji, a devotee in the Radhaswami tradition of Santmat and a close friend of Baba Devi Sahab, is said to have invited him to Agra to attend Satsang there. It is Padma Das Ji who is said to have introduced Baba Devi Sahab to Rai Bahadur Shaligram Ji (Hazur Rai Saligram Bahadur). {{QuotePadma Das took Baba Devi to Rai Bahadur Shaligram's Satsang. There, Padma Das narrated to Shaligram Sahab about his (Baba Devi's) story -- his intensified devotion from the childhood, demise of parents in very short [young] age, his firm determination and increasing intuition to spend his life as Yogi in a lonely place. Hearing all of these, Rai Sahab asked Baba Devi, 'Do you know the method of meditation which you want to practice in a secluded place?' 'Yes' -- Baba Devi replied humbly. Then Shaligram Sahab asked, 'From where you have got it?' Baba Devi told, 'I am disciple of Sant Tulsi Sahab and he himself has blessed me.' Then Shaligram Sahab became very glad to hear it and told [Baba Devi] that 'you are a member of my own family because Sant Tulsi Sahib was my most reverend.' Rai Sahab further explained about the association of his Guru (master), Shiv Dayal Swami Ji and Sant Tulsi Sahab's disciple Giridhari Das. He disclosed that his Guru Shiv Dayal ji used to tell that he (Shiv Dayal) had been greatly benefited with the association of Baba Giridhari Das, a disciple of Sant Tulsi Sahab.source=The Biography of Baba Devi Sahab, excerpted in English at the SadguruMehi website on a web page titled, \\"Life And Teachings of Baba Devi Sahab\\"). Preaching Baba Devi Sahab preached the oneness of God that indwells each & every being. That one only God, he taught, can be realised within by every human being regardless of one's caste, creed, region or religion by practicing inner meditation - meditation on inner light and meditation on inner sound also known as surat shabd yoga - learnt from a true adept or sadguru. While some other lineages of Santmat (Sant Mat) in due course of time took on different names relating to their founders or some other suitable terms like Kabir Panth, Dariya Panth, Radhasoami etc., Baba Devi Sahab preferred to continue with the more general and generic term Santmat. Baba Devi Sahab gave a clear exposition of the inner cosmology based on his own experiences of inner meditation. In the Preface to the Ghat Ramayan (Ghat Ramayan' is the name of a book popularly believed to have been authored by Sant Tulsi Sahab of Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, India. Baba Devi Sahab got the hand-written manuscript of Sant Tulsi Sahab of Hathras printed at Hathras itself in the year of 1896) of Sant Tulsi Sahab of Hathras, he has presented a precise chart of the fourteen inner planes. Baba Devi Sahab preached that it was by no other means save inner meditation which consisted mainly of the Yoga of Inner Light and the Yoga of Inner Sound that one could attain complete liberation from the shackles of transmigration. He would preach that selfless pure love, 'ishq' or 'bhakti' towards the God is of utmost importance. He cautioned people to very carefully and meticulously guard against the vices of jealousy and vainglory as these defile our mind. Disciples Baba Devi Sahab, who was the contemporary of Param Purush Puran Dhani Soamiji Maharaj (Shiv Dayal Singh) and Sant Hazur Rai Saligram Bahadur Sahab Ji, had several disciples including Shri Nandan Das, but Maharshi Mehi Paramhans proved himself to be his most prominent disciple and the worthiest successor who organised the lineage of Santmat in a much more systematic way and took it to the dizziest of heights of fame & glory spreading its fragrance even overseas to countries like the USA, the UK, the erstwhile USSR, Japan, Norway, Sweden, Nepal etc. Notes References * * Category:Sant Mat Category:1841 births Category:1919 deaths Category:Sant Mat gurus ","title":"Devi Sahab"},{"id":"33633960","text":"Alcis postlurida is a moth of the family Geometridae.

Culture Even though being a small community and having been exposed to western culture due to centuries of European rule of the place, people from the SKP community celebrate their festivals so as to pass down their traditions to the next generation. Exceptions to certain celebration like the high caste Hindu sacred thread ceremony \\"Munja Ceremony\\", which was abolished in the early 20th centuries by the leaders of the society, because as such it is unnecessary expense and was not relevant in this day and age.

Despite the name, the unit included both Black Seminoles and some native Seminoles. However, because most of the Seminole scouts were of African descent, they were often attached to the Buffalo Soldier regiments,Chronological list of battles to guide the troops through hostile territory. The majority of their service was in the 1870s, in which they played a significant role in ending the Texas-Indian Wars.BLACK SEMINOLE SCOUTS  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA)Black Seminole Indians, African American Indians, Texas Indians Service history =Texas-Indian Wars= By 1870, the native Seminoles were living on a reservation in the Indian Territory but originally they came from Florida. Before the United States government banned slavery in December 1865, several hundred black freedmen escaped their masters and sought refuge among the Seminoles in Florida. Not long after the Seminoles were removed to the Indian Territory, the Black Seminoles, as they became, went to Coahuila, Mexico, to escape enslavement. There they were welcomed by the Mexicans and later joined by native Seminoles, Black Creeks and Black Cherokees. In 1870, the United States Army issued a message to the Black Seminoles' chief, John Horse, inviting him and his band to come back to the United States to enlist as Indian scouts and help fight hostile natives Americans. The Black Seminoles, about 200 people, accepted the agreement, believing that they would be granted land in the United States, food and provisions, as well as reimbursement for traveling costs. Though over the years, none of these conditions were met. The future scouts crossed the international border on July 4 and were officially mustered into service on August 18 at Fort Duncan, near Eagle Pass, Texas. However, in July 1872, most of the scouts were moved to Fort Clark, near Brackettville. Their first able commander was a Quaker and Civil War veteran, Lieutenant John L. Bullis, the others were too unreliable to control the unit. Having been a commander of black soldiers during the Civil War, Bullis was trusted by his men and even asked to perform marriages for the tribe. Between May 1872 and 1881, the Seminole scouts fought in several successful engagements with Comanches, Kiowas, Apaches and Kickapoos, sometimes traveling into Mexico, the Indian Territory and Kansas. During their service against hostiles, not a single scout, out of no more than fifty men, was killed or seriously injured. Usually the scouts fought with the cavalry regiments stationed at Fort Clark but occasionally they launched their own operations. Fort Clark was also the headquarters of Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, the leader of multiple expeditions into Mexico to punish hostile natives that crossed the border to raid in the United States. Mackenzie played a key role in ending the Indian wars in Texas. In 1873, the Secretary of War William W. Belknap and General Philip Sheridan went to Fort Clark for \\"secret talks\\" with Mackenzie. It was decided that the colonel would lead a punitive expedition across the border to fight the Lipan and that scouts would guide the way. On May 17, 1873, Colonel Mackenzie crossed the border into Coahuilla with the scouts and a detachment of 4th Cavalry. They fought a successful skirmish against Kickapoo raiders at El Remolino, forced the Mexican Army to keep from intervening and then hastily returned to the fort. During the Red River War, a notable engagement occurred on September 19, 1874, when three Black Seminole scouts and two Tonkawa scouts were sent out by Mackenzie to search for enemies. During the journey the five men were ambushed by about forty Kiowas. The only option was to try and fight their way out and escape. Details of the engagement are unclear but the scout Adam Payne was awarded the Medal of Honor for risking his life to save the others. Under fire, Payne engaged the Kiowas, allowing the other four men to get away. Eventually Payne's horse was shot out from underneath him but he was able to kill one of the attackers and take his horse. Payne was decorated for his \\"habitual courage\\" and received the Medal of Honor. Three more scouts received the Medal of Honor in 1875 for their \\"bravery and trustworthiness\\" during a skirmish on April 25 against Comanches who had raided a stagecoach on April 5 and stolen some horses. The scouts John Ward, Isaac Payne and Pompey Factor were with Lieutenant Bullis on an expedition to locate the Comanches encamped on the lower Pecos River. When the camp was found a battle ensued. The scouts dismounted and positioned themselves behind some rocks so that they would appear to be a larger force. According to Bullis' report \\"we twice took their horses from them and killed three Indians and wounded a fourth\\" but the hostiles, about thirty of them, eventually discovered the size of the scouting party and attempted to surround it in order to cut off the scouts from their horses. The scouts made it to their horses though and they were on their way back to safety when they realized that Lieutenant Bullis had been left behind. Under heavy fire, the scouts turned around and rescued their commander. In May 1876 Chief John Horse was badly wounded and the scout Titus Payne was killed after a shooting incident in Eagle Pass. There was apparently no effort to catch the shooters because the former outlaw and sheriff John King Fisher was suspected of being responsible. Fisher was a horse thief and cattle rustler in his early life and well known for his hatred of the scouts. By 1876 he was a sheriff and had almost indisputable control over Kinney County. Because of this power Fisher was untouchable. The shooting created unrest among the Black Seminoles and over the course of the next few months there were outbreaks of brawling and rioting. The local American settlers attempted to have the scouts disbanded but others argued that the army should enlist all of the male Black Seminoles as scouts in order to protect them from outlaws and hostile natives. In late August, John Ward's brother, Scott, was accused of stealing five horses and then in September Isaac Payne and Dallas Griner were accused of stealing a horse from Deputy Sheriff Claron Windus. The two evaded arrest and fled to Nacimiento, Mexico but they made the mistake of returning to Brackettville in December to celebrate the coming of the new year. Somehow the sheriff of Brackettville, Lorenzo C. Crowell, learned of the celebration and devised a plan to capture the fugitives. So on the night of December 31, Sheriff Crowell, Deputy Sheriff Windus and a teamster named Jonathan May went to the Seminole's reservation just outside town and stealthily positioned themselves around the fugitive's camp. One later account of the incident says that a company of soldiers was to assist in the arrest but if this was true they played no active role in the event. At midnight Sheriff Crowell made his appearance, some accounts say the Black Seminoles were dancing at a church when Crowell appeared and others say that the celebrating took place on the property of the scout Friday Bowleg. According to one account, Adam Payne was dancing when he heard Crowell call his name. As he turned, Claron Windus fired upon him with a shotgun and \\"shot him so close it set him on fire.\\" Other accounts say that there was a struggle while Crowell was trying to handcuff the men and that Adam and the scout Frank Enoch were shot while trying to escape. The scout Bobby Kibbett attacked Windus at that point and while Windus and Crowell were fighting with him Isaac Payne and Dallas Griner got away to Mexico. Adam's body was given to his family for burial and Enoch died during surgery in Brackettville. Bobby Kibbett was later tried and acquitted for attempting to murder Deputy Sheriff Windus and the charges against Isaac Payne and Dallas Griner were dropped. Payne stayed in Mexico for a few weeks before returning to Fort Clark to re-enlist.The Wild West Of The Seminole Negro Indian ScoutsFort Clark In 1878, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie was recalled to the fort in order to lead an expedition against the Kickapoo. After this campaign the Texas-Indian Wars were mostly over, all of the hostile natives were either dead or living in the reservation system. However, on February 23, 1893 the scouts fought in one final skirmish against Mexican bandits at Las Muias Ranch, thirty miles north of Fort Ringgold in Starr County.United States, pg. 143 = Disbandment and legacy = The Black Seminole Scouts were disbanded twenty-one years later in 1914 and most were forced to leave the Fort Clark reservation with their families. Just twenty-seven Black Seminoles were allowed to remain at the fort but only until the elders of the group had departed. The official report of the disbandment reads as follows: > \\"In compliance with orders contained in the 3rd Indorsement Headquarters > Southern Department, May 7th, 1914, and the 5th Indorsement War Department, > June 29th, 1914, on communications 2128018-A.A.G.O., April 16, 1914 - > Subject Seminole Negro Indian Scouts.

Descendants of the Black Seminole Scouts still live in southern Texas (Brackettville, Texas, Del Rio, Texas) and northern Mexico.Indian Scout Cemetery =Enlistment length= The duration of an enlistment agreement was set at six-months until the 20th century. This reflected the scouts' disinterest in long-term commitments and the Army's opinion that the need for scouts would not last long. Some scouts would serve more than once. Family legacies and structure Within the scout community, there were certain surnames that were well known. Of the 152 scouts that served between 1870 and 1914, there were seventeen \\"Wilson\\"s, eleven \\"Payne\\"s, eight \\"July\\"s, seven \\"Factor\\"s, seven \\"Bowleg\\"s, six \\"Washington\\"s, six \\"Daniels\\"s, and six \\"Bruner\\"s. Many of these families were also intermarried.

Development  The US Polaris A-3T warhead was the US W58. Britain considered but never used the W58 because the British safety authorities considered it unsafe in several respects. Instead they fitted a hybrid of a US W59 fusion secondary, triggered by a new British primary based on a Cleo boosted-fission device tested in Nevada as PAMPAS and TENDRAC. Variants of this basic design were used or intended for several other delivery systems, including the WE.177 bomb, UK Skybolt ALBM, and the Blue Water SSM (a tactical battlefield missile), and several others. Documents declassified and released into the public domain in 2012 disclose that ET.317 was a warhead that used the fission-fusion-fission process, where a boosted-fission device codenamed Jennie triggered a fusion secondary codenamed Reggie The Real Meaning of the Words: A Very Pedantic Guide to British Nuclear Weapons Codenames which in turn was encased in U-238 depleted uranium.Public Record Office, London. AVIA 65/1845 In the conditions created in the fusion process, vast quantities of free neutrons are liberated, and the normally unfissionable U-238 casing fissions. This results in a smaller, lighter, cheaper, dirtier weapon than one using only a fission-fusion process. Fission of the depleted uranium casing can generate a significant proportion of total weapon yield, and compared to other fissile material U-238 is cheap and plentiful as a waste product from HEU manufacture. Jennie was based on the Cleo device tested at PAMPAS and TENDRAC. Reggie was based on the US W59 fusion secondary. Since the Reggie secondary manufactured in the UK from British-owned materials was a copy of the US W59, by implication, the W59 thermonuclear weapon deployed in some Minuteman I ICBMs also used the fission- fusion-fission process. Although the physical dimensions of ET.317 are not themselves declassified, the dimensions of the Mk.2 ReB (Re-entry Bus) are.Royal Aeronautical Society Symposium.

Much smaller than the 16.3 inches previously claimed for the W59. The yield of ET.317 was stated in official documents on many occasions to be 200 kt. When retired, the Reggie fusion secondary was recycled and reused in its successor, the Chevaline warhead, matched to a new boosted- fission trigger codenamed Harriet. In that form, it is claimed to yield 225 kt, although there are as yet no official sources for that claim. Because the Chevaline warheads numbered two per missile, rather than the previous three ET.317 warheads, the surplus warheads were dismantled and while Jennie was no longer required, some Reggie secondaries were refurbished and installed as the secondary in WE.177C aircraft-delivered tactical nuclear bombs.Public Record Office, London.

Nurlela's father constantly compares Hasan negatively to his rich son-in-law Bakri (August Melasz), causing friction between the young couple. They eventually find a way to move out. Style Film critic Hikmat Dramawan, writing for the National Library of Indonesia, called the film \\"acting-focused\\", with the camerawork serving to reinforce the acting. He describes it as coming across like an art film, based on its camerawork. Themes Dramawan notes that the Di Balik Kelambu draws heavily on Indonesian family values, and is capable of illustrating the economic and social hardships undergone by families at the time. He describes it as an \\"adult drama\\". Parmita Uniyal, writing in the Hindustan Times, notes that the film portrays how economic and professional failure can lead to the loss of independence and the will to live. Release and reception Di Balik Kelambu was released in 1983 and did well commercially. El Masrur Sahlan, writing for Tabloid Bintang, notes that Rahardjo and Hakim (who often played lovers) had their best chemistry in the film, with both playing their parts as if it were truly happening to them. Uniyal also noted that the two came across convincingly, with Rahardjo's character coming across subtly and Hakim's being more emotional.

The stockade was finally reconstructed as a Bicentennial project in 1975‚Äì76. The original fort was built of horizontal logs with a bastion at each corner.

They released one album, Fiction Tales, on the independent UK label Dindisc in 1981. History The band, originally called Luglo Slugs, were founded by guitarist/vocalist Alix Plain (real name Alex Johnson) and bassist Danny Hampson, later joined by drummer Dave Hardbattle. The Luglo Slugs lineup recorded \\"Benched Down/70s Sixties\\" at Open Eye Studios in Liverpool. Soon after the recording, Hardbattle left. Guitarist Ged Allen and drummer Joey McKechnie joined, and the band eventually decided on the name Modern Eon. The Open Eye recording was released under the name Modern Eon in late 1978 on the compilation album Street to Street: A Liverpool Album. After one self-released EP, Pieces, released on Eon Records in 1979, they recorded the single \\"Euthenics\\" for Inevitable Records in 1980. Allen and McKechnie left the band in 1980, prior to the recording of their debut album, and were replaced by Bob Wakelin (strings, vocals, percussion) and Tim Lever (guitar, saxophone), with Cliff Hewitt (drums) joining shortly thereafter. In early 1981, a rerecorded version of \\"Euthenics\\" was released as a single on Dindisc followed by two more singles, \\"Child's Play\\" and \\"Mechanic\\". Fiction Tales was released in mid 1981 to much critical acclaim. After a tour was arranged that year, drummer Hewitt critically injured his wrist, forcing them to go on tour using Hewitt's drum playing on a tape machine. Modern Eon dissolved by the end of 1981 while working on demos for a second album, which was never released. Lever later played with Dead or Alive, while Hewitt was a member of Apollo 440.
