A collection of Roth's papers is housed at the Rubenstein Library at Duke University.  Work  Roth has worked in the fields of game theory, market design, and experimental economics. In particular, he helped redesign mechanisms for selecting medical residents, New York City high schools and Boston primary schools. Describing the dynamism of market design, Roth suggests that 'As the conditions of the market change, the behavior of people change and that causes old rules to be discarded and new rules to be created'.Alvin Roth. https://www.ubs.com/microsites/nobel- perspectives/en/alvin-roth.html in UBS Nobel Perspectives interview, 2012. = Case study in game theory = Roth's 1984 paper on the National Resident Matching Program (NRMP) highlighted the system designed by John Stalknaker and F. J. Mullen in 1952. The system was built on theoretical foundations independently introduced by David Gale and Lloyd Shapley in 1962.D. Gale and L. S. Shapley: \\"College Admissions and the Stability of Marriage\\", American Mathematical Monthly 69, 9‚Äì14, 1962. Roth proved that the NRMP was both stable and strategy-proof for unmarried residents but deferred to future study the question of how to match married couples efficiently.Alvin E. Roth (1984). \\"The Evolution of the Labor Market for Medical Interns and Residents: A Case Study in Game Theory\\" . In: Journal of Political Economy 92: 991‚Äì1016. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In 1999 Roth redesigned the matching program to ensure stable matches even with married couples.Roth, Alvin E. Deferred Acceptance Algorithms: History, Theory, Practice, and Open Questions, International Journal of Game Theory, Special Issue in Honor of David Gale on his 85th birthday, 36, March 2008, 537‚Äì569.Sara Robinson. \\"Tweaking the Math to Make Happier Medical Marriages\\". in: The New York Times. August 24, 2004. = New York City public school system = Roth later helped design the market to match New York City public school students to high schools as incoming freshmen. Previously, the school district had students mail in a list of their five preferred schools in rank order, then mailed a photocopy of that list to each of the five schools. As a result, schools could tell whether or not students had listed them as their first choice. This meant that some students really had a choice of one school, rather than five. It also meant that students had an incentive to hide their true preferences. Roth and his colleagues Atila Abdulkadiroƒülu and Parag Pathak proposed David Gale and Lloyd Shapley's incentive-compatible student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm to the school board in 2003. The school board accepted the measure as the method of selection for New York City public school students. Alvin E. Roth (2005). \\"The New York City High School Match\\" (or here ). With Atila Abdulkadiroglu and Parag A. Pathak. in: American Economic Review, Papers and Proceedings 95. (2): 364‚Äì367. = Boston's public school system = Working with Atila Abdulkadiroƒülu, Parag A. Pathak, and Tayfun Sonmez, Roth presented a similar measure to Boston's public school system in 2003. Here the Boston system gave so much preference to an applicant's first choice that were a student to not receive her first or second choice, it was likely that she would not be matched with any school on her list and be administratively assigned to schools which had vacancies. Gareth Cook (2003). \\"School assignment flaws detailed: Two economists study problem, offer relief\\" In: The Boston Globe 2003-9-12. Some Boston parents had informally recognized this feature of the system and developed detailed lists in order to avoid having their children administratively assigned.Alvin E. Roth. (2007). \\"Robert Rosenthal Memorial Lecture 2007: What Have we Learned from Market Design?\\" Flash, Web Video. Boston: Boston University.Roth noted that the West Zone Parents Group at Yahoo Groups, among others, devoted considerable time and effort to estimating capacity for schools in the area and disseminated recommendations on the basis of those estimates. Boston held public hearings on the school selection system and finally in 2005 settled on David Gale and Lloyd Shapley's incentive-compatible student-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm. = New England Program for Kidney Exchange = Roth is a founder of the New England Program for Kidney Exchange along with Tayfun Sonmez and Utku Unver, a registry and matching program that pairs compatible kidney donors and recipients. The program was designed to operate primarily through the use of two pairs of incompatible donors. Each donor was incompatible with her partner but could be compatible with another donor who was likewise incompatible with his partner. Francis Delmonico, a transplant surgeon at Harvard Medical School, describes a typical situation, Because the National Organ Transplant Act forbids the creation of binding contracts for organ transplant, steps in the procedure had to be performed roughly simultaneously. Two pairs of patients means four operating rooms and four surgical teams acting in concert with each other. Hospitals and professionals in the transplant community felt that the practical burden of three pairwise exchanges would be too large. While the original theoretical work discovered that an \\"efficient frontier\\" would be reached with exchanges between three pairs of otherwise incompatible donors, it was determined that the goals of the program would not be sacrificed by limiting exchanges to pairs of incompatible donors. A 12-party (six donors and six recipients) kidney exchange was performed in April 2008. Personal Roth is married and has two sons. His elder son, Aaron Roth, is a professor of computer science at the University of Pennsylvania. , his younger son, Ben Roth, is an Assistant Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.

Its main role is laying down the guidelines for the policy of the council of mayor and aldermen and exercising control over its execution by the council of mayor and aldermen. The municipal councils range in size from nine to 45 seats, depending on the municipality's population, and are elected by the population every four years. In many municipalities all major political parties contest in the election in addition to local parties. In most major, urban municipalities, all major parties are represented in the municipal council, while in smaller and more rural municipalities, only the largest parties and a local party have seats in the municipal council. All citizens and foreigners who live in the Netherlands for at least four years in a municipality have the right to vote and almost all citizens can be elected. Ministers and state secretaries in the national government are barred from standing in elections as well as mayors and civil servants employed by the municipality. After the elections the parties in the states elect the aldermen. The municipal council is supported by its own civil service headed by the council's greffier (raadsgriffier). Members of the council are not paid as full-time politicians; instead, most of them have day job. As in most legislatures, the members of municipal council work in both political groups and policy area related committees. The mayor chairs the meetings of the council. A duoraadslid (\\"dual municipal councillor\\"; plural duoraadsleden) is a political position in the municipal councils of some municipalities. The duoraadslid is a representative of a political party who is not elected into a municipal council. A duoraadslid has the right to speak in the meetings of committees of the municipal council and in the preparatory part of council meetings. This allows small groups in a municipal council to spread the duties of membership of the municipal council among more people. It is often a requirement that the duoraadslid was on the party list for the election. Research at Erasmus University indicated that duoraadsleden increase participation of young politicians in municipal politics.

It was founded in 1972 as the Shorter Players by Chris Silva, Robert Woodruff and Carl Lumbly. In 1974 its name was changed to the Eureka Theatre. In October 1981 the company was staging David Edgar's The Jail Diary of Albie Sachs when their space in the basement of the Trinity Methodist Church burned in an arson attack. By 1990 the company had moved to an industrial building at 2730 16th Street in the Mission. The company is noted because in 1986 Oskar Eustis, then its dramaturg, and Tony Taccone, then its artistic director, commissioned a play from Tony Kushner. Eustis had seen Kushner's play A Bright Room Called Day in New York. The contract specified it should run no more than 2 hours, and include songs. With help from a $50,000 grant from the National Endowment for the Arts, it eventually turned into Angels in America, two three-and-a-half hour plays with no songs. In 1991 the company staged the world premiere of the first part, Millennium Approaches and staged readings of the second part, Perestroika, which was still being written. The cost of staging Angels in America, about $250,000, ended the Eureka's career as a production company, although they continued to present plays, In 1998 the company took over the Gateway Theater in Jackson Square. Due to rising costs and the 2013 diversion of San Francisco's hotel tax fund away from the arts the company closed on 5 July 2017.

Cystitis Cystitis is a urinary bladder inflammation that results from any one of a number of distinct syndromes. It is most commonly caused by a bacterial infection in which case it is referred to as a urinary tract infection. Bladder trauma Bladder rupture (rupture of bladder, ) may occur if the bladder is overfilled and not emptied. This can occur in the case of binge drinkers who have consumed large quantities of fluids, but are not conscious of the need to urinate due to stupor. This condition is very rare in women, but does occur. Signs and symptoms include localized pain and uraemia (poisoning due to reabsorbed waste). =Intra- and extraperitoneal rupture= Bladder rupture is divided into intraperitoneal and extraperitoneal rupture, with the latter encompassing 85% of post-traumatic bladder rupture.

This local government body plays a central role in municipal politics in the Netherlands. It consists of the mayor (burgemeester) and the members of the municipal executive (wethouders). Belgium has a similar system, which is referred to as the college van burgemeester en schepenen in the Dutch language.  Translation  College van burgemeester en wethouders is expressed in English in several ways, but \\"Mayor and Municipal Executive\\" or \\"Mayor and Executive Board\\" comes closest. The college van burgemeester en wethouders should not be confused with the town council itself (gemeenteraad). A Dutch mayor (burgemeester) is sometimes called a \\"burgomaster\\" in English, but \\"mayor\\" is a more standard and conventional English translation. A wethouder is a formal title in Dutch, but there is no real English equivalent. In English it is possible to address someone as \\"councillor\\" or \\"alderman\\", but this would refer more to someone sitting on the municipal council rather than the executive board. In the UK \\"alderman\\" is an honorary title. Sometimes wethouder is translated into English as \\"alderman\\", and indeed there is some similarity between the office of wethouder and the office of alderman as it used to exist in the UK before 1974; however, the term \\"alderman\\" is no longer used in many English-speaking countries (including the UK, Ireland, Canada and Australia), where it has mostly been replaced by other terms. Even in the US, where the term alderman is still actively used, \\"alderman\\" often refers to someone sitting on the municipal council rather than someone sitting on the executive board. Alderman is now seen by many as an inappropriate title for a woman, and for that reason alone does not really serve as an appropriate translation for the gender-neutral term wethouder. \\"Municipal executive councillor\\" or \\"municipal executive board member\\" serve as better translations for wethouder.  Composition and appointment  A Dutch mayor (Frank Koen, Municipality of Capelle aan den IJssel, 2010) The mayor (burgemeester) of a municipality is ex officio the chair of the municipality's executive board. He or she has the casting vote in the event of a tie. Apart from this, however, the mayor is at the same level as the other members of the executive board. The municipal secretary (gemeentesecretaris), who is chosen by the executive board, is responsible for the day-to-day operation of the executive board and assists with administrative and support matters. After every municipal election, the wethouders are elected to the executive by the members of the municipal council. Wethouders hold office at the pleasure of the city council. The city council can remove someone from the office by way of a non-confidence motion (motie van wantrouwen). Usually the municipal council elects sitting members of the council to the executive board, but it is also possible for them to elect someone from outside the council. When a member of the council becomes a \\"wethouder\\" they must resign their seat on the council, which is then filled by the next person on the party list. According to the Municipality Act (Gemeentewet), the number of wethouders cannot exceed 20% of the number of members of the municipal council (rounded up), but there must be at least two. In Dutch municipalities with 18,000 inhabitants or less, the office of wethouder is a part-time one. In larger municipalities the office is a full-time position, but the municipal council can choose to designate one or more wethouder positions as part-time positions, in which case the number of wethouders can go up to 25% of the number of municipal council members. Prior to the 2002 'dualist' reform (see the Dutch version of this entry), wethouders could only be delegated from among the town council and thus had to be residents. Since the 2002 reform, any town council members appointed wethouder have to resign, but nonmembers and even nonresidents (e.g., technical professionals) can be appointed wethouders.  Duties  The executive roughly plays the same role in municipal government that a cabinet plays in national government. The wethouders are assigned portfolios within the municipal government and, in this capacity, prepare, coordinate, and plan policy and legislation for the council as a whole. They are also charged with the day-to- day government of the municipality and the implementation of legislation. The wethouders report to the municipal council on all aspects of what is happening within their portfolios. The college van burgemeester en wethouders functions as a committee that reaches decisions by way of consensus.  Party politics  Rotterdam City Hall Political parties play an active role in municipal politics in the Netherlands. Most candidates who run for municipal office are affiliated with a political party. The elected members of a municipal council are usually members of various political parties. The party with the most members on the council is seen as being in control of the town government. Quite often there is no single dominant party, so coalitions are formed. Since the council members vote for the members of the municipal executive, the municipal executive is also chosen along party lines. When it comes to this aspect of local government, there are two types of municipal executive. One type is called a \\"programme-based executive\\" (programmacollege); the other a \\"mirror executive\\" (afspiegelingscollege). Most executive boards in the Netherlands are programme-based. A programme-based executive board is elected on the basis of a clear political programme by a majority vote of all the members of the municipal council. Thus, if the majority of members of the municipal council are members of a given party, it is likely that all members on the executive will be from that party or support that party and the board will have no difficulty implementing the party's programme. However, since the rise of \\"cohabitation\\" in Dutch municipal politics, and given the multi-party nature of Dutch politics, most executive boards have consisted of members from various parties, despite being programme-based. A \\"mirror\\" executive board is one in which the make-up of the municipal executive reflects the distribution of the major parties in the municipal council. For example, if the members of the municipal council are evenly split between three mainstream parties, the members of the executive board will also be evenly split between these three parties.  Issues  Municipal councillors sometimes form party-based coalitions and vote in blocks to prevent members of opposing political parties from sitting on the executive board. So a party that does well in municipal election might be shut out of the municipal executive. For example, from 2002 to 2006, the municipal executive of Rotterdam consisted of municipal councillors from parties from the right of the spectrum (CDA, VVD and Leefbaar Rotterdam, the last of these being the most to the right). A mainstream party on the left, PvdA, had the second largest number of members on the Rotterdam municipal council, but they were kept out of the executive because of ideological conflicts with Leefbaar Rotterdam. The same happened in Groningen, but in reverse. Left-leaning parties elected in 2006 (PvdA, SP and the Groenlinks) kept members of parties on the right out of the executive, despite a strong performance in the polls.

Additionally, business acumen has emerged as a vehicle for improving financial performance and leadership development.Summerfield, Brian. \\"A Crisis in Leadership\\" , Chief Learning Officer Magazine, April 2008. Consequently, several different types of strategies have developed around improving business acumen.  Characteristics  = Executive level thinking = In his 2012 work, Seeing the Big Picture, Business Acumen to Build Your Credibility, Career, and Company, Kevin R. Cope put forward that an individual who possesses business acumen views the business with an \\"executive mentality\\" - they understand how the moving parts of a company work together to make it successful and how financial metrics like profit margin, cash flow, and stock price reflect how well each of those moving parts is doing its job. Cope proposes that an individual who has the following five abilities could be described as someone having a strong sense of business acumen: #See the ‚Äúbig picture‚Äù of the organization‚Äîhow the key drivers of the business relate to each other, work together to produce profitable growth, and relate to the job #Understand important company communications and data, including financial statements #Use knowledge to make good decisions #Understand how actions and decisions impact key company measures and leadership objectives #Effectively communicate ideas to other employees, managers, executives, and the public = Distinguishing traits = Raymond R. Reilly of the Ross School of Business at the University of Michigan and Gregory P. Reilly of the University of Connecticut document traits that individuals with business acumen possess: * An acute perception of the dimensions of business issues * Ability to make sense out of complexity and an uncertain future * Cognizance of the implications of a choice for all the affected parties * Decisive * Flexibility for further change if warranted in the future Thus, developing stronger business acumen means a more thoughtful analysis, clearer logic underlying business decisions, closer attention to key dimensions of implementation and operation, and more disciplined performance management. = Financial literacy = Financial literacy is a comprehensive understanding of the drivers of growth, profitability, and cash flow; an organization's financial statements; key performance measures; and the implications of decisions on value creation. In a SHRM article entitled, \\"Business Acumen Involves More Than Numbers\\"Hastings, Rebecca R. \\"Business Acumen Involves More Than Numbers\\", SHRM, April 2008. Chris Berger, member of human resources at CTPartners, explains that business acumen starts with the ability to understand how a company makes decisions, and that leaders must be financially literate and be able to understand numbers on company financial statements. It entails the ability to take the knowledge of business fundamentals and use it to think strategically and then take appropriate action. According to E. Ted Prince, \\"Financial literacy is almost never the need for senior managers and high potentials. Most already possess degrees in business, including MBAs, and many have also had experience in the business sides of their professional roles. The need for these managers is to understand how their actions and their behavior impact their financial decision-making and how this in turn affects financial outcomes at the unit and the corporate level.\\" It's evident that an individual with business acumen has some level of financial understanding and knowledge - but someone who is financially literate doesn't necessarily possess strong business acumen.http://www.perthleadership.org/documents/Business_Acumen_WP_Updated.pdf = Business management and leadership = Bob Selden, faculty member of Mobilizing People, a leadership development program based in Switzerland, observes a complementary relationship between business acumen and leadership.Selden, Bob. \\"Is Business Acumen a Substitute for Leadership?\\" , 26 February 2008. Selden states the importance of nurturing both the development of strategic skills and that of good leadership and management skills in order for business leaders to achieve effectiveness. A study published in Human Resource Management International Digest titled, Business acumen: a critical concern of modern leadership development: Global trends accelerate the move away from traditional approaches, reveals why traditional leadership development approaches, which rely on personality and competency assessments as the scientific core of their approach, are failing. The paper demonstrates the importance of business acumen in leadership-development approaches and contends that business acumen will have an increasing impact on leadership development and HR agendas. Research into this relationship resulted in the creation of the Perth Leadership Outcome Model, which links financial outcomes to individual leadership traits. In a study that interviewed 55 global business leaders, business acumen was cited as the most critical competency area for global leaders. In their 2011 work, The Leadership Pipeline, Ram Charan, Stephen Drotter, and James Noel study the process and criteria for selecting a group manager, and suggest that the process and criteria are similar for selecting a CEO. According to them an obvious criterium for selecting a leader is well-developed business acumen. An organization full of high business acumen individuals can expect to see leaders with a heightened perspective that translates into an ability to inspire and excite the organization to achieve its potential. Development Programs designed to improve an individual or group's business acumen have supported the recognition of the concept as a significant topic in the corporate world. Executive Development Associates' 2009/2010 survey of Chief Learning Officers, Senior Vice Presidents of Human Resources, and Heads of Executive and Leadership Development listed business acumen as the second most significant trend in executive development.Hagemann, Bonnie \\"2009/2010 Trends in Executive Development\\", 2009. A 2011 report explores the impact of business acumen training on an organization in terms of intangibles and more tangible expressions of value.Anderson, Dr. Merrill C. \\"MetrixGlobal Study of Business Acumen Training\\" , March 2011. The findings support the notion that business acumen is a learned skill - developed on the job by learning the required skills from knowledge mentors while working in different employment positions. They also suggest that the learning process ranges widely, from structured internal company training programs, to an individual's self-chosen moves from one position to another. The combination of these reports and surveys indicate that business acumen is a learned skill of increasing importance within the corporate world. There are different types of business acumen development programs available: = Business simulations = A business simulation is another corporate development tool used to increase business acumen. Several companies offer business simulations as a way to educate mid-level managers and non-financial leaders within their organization on cash flow and financial-decision-making processes. Their forms can vary from computer simulations to boardgame-style simulations. = Psychological assessments = The advent of personal assessments for business acumen is based in the emerging theories of behavioral finance and attempts to correlate innate personality traits with positive financial outcomes.Perth Leadership Institute White Paper:Business Acumen and Leadership Development for CEOs and Senior Executives This method approaches business acumen not as entirely based in either knowledge or experience, but on the combination of these and other factors which comprise an individual's financial personality or \\"signature\\". The results from this research have been limited, but noteworthy.

She has held positions as political editor on BBC Two's Newsnight, national editor of ITV News, and co-presenter of Peston on Sunday. From April 2020, she was Chancellor Rishi Sunak's director of strategic communications at the Treasury, before being announced as the new press secretary for 10 Downing Street in October 2020. Early life Stratton was born in Chiswick, West London on 25 November 1980 as one of four children of a translator father and textile artist mother. She was named after Allegra Byron. Stratton attended Chiswick Community School and Latymer Upper School, an independent school in West London. She then attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where she read archaeology and anthropology. Career Stratton worked as a producer for the BBC, on the foreign desk at The Times and wrote for The Independent and the New Statesman. She then joined The Guardian as a political correspondent, presenting the newspaper's \\"Politics Weekly\\" podcast with journalist Tom Clark. During this period she wrote the novel Muhajababes, which explores the youth culture of the Middle East and the contradictions of the modern life of young adults in Muslim societies. The book was based on Stratton's experiences travelling in the region in 2005. Stratton returned to the BBC on 20 February 2012, as political editor of Newsnight, replacing Michael Crick who left to become a political correspondent for Channel 4. In May the same year, she faced criticism for a Newsnight interview with a single mother who was claiming housing benefit. The interviewee described feeling \\"humiliated\\" by Stratton, who misrepresented her as unemployed. Private Eye magazine reported that Stratton had chosen the single mother over several other interviewees offered, including a couple with four children who had lost their jobs and faced homelessness. This incident led to a 20,000-signature petition soliciting an apology from Stratton and Newsnight. Following an official complaint to the BBC's Editorial Complaints Unit, a correction and apology was issued in August. During her time at Newsnight, she declined to take part in the interview which mistakenly accused Alistair McAlpine of child sexual abuse. In November 2015, Stratton left the BBC to join ITV News as its national editor. She made her first appearance on ITV's News at Ten in January 2016 and co-presented Peston on Sunday with Robert Peston until April 2018, when she departed to spend more time with her children. In April 2020, she quit ITV News to become director of strategic communications at the Treasury under Chancellor Rishi Sunak. Six months later, in October 2020, she was appointed the new Downing Street Press Secretary, and as such will be fronting the new daily televised press briefings scheduled for launch in November. Personal life Allegra Stratton is married to James Forsyth, political editor of The Spectator magazine. The couple have two children and live in Canonbury, North London.

Foreign envoys and emissaries are automatically protected by aman. The imam is permitted to grant an aman to any number, including entire populations. Any private Muslim individual has the juridical competence to grant an aman to as many as ten who are otherwise denizens of the Dar al-Harb. Types of safe-conducts The short-term safe- conduct can be personal or general: * Personal aman (khass) can be granted by any sane and mature Muslim to one or a group of non-Muslim foreigners (harbis).Yakoob, Mir p. 109 * General aman ('amm) can be granted only by the caliph or his deputy to an unspecified number of harbis. The term is valid up to one year for the musta'min, along with his minor children and all the women related to him. Many Hanbalite jurists allowed the period of aman to one lunar year. Others argued for an indefinite aman. Legal rights Once given amaan, the musta'mins are free to engage in trade and travel. They are allowed to bring their family and children. They have permission to visit any city in Muslim territory except the holy cities of Mecca and Medina. A musta'min man is allowed to marry a dhimmi woman and take her back to his homeland; however, musta'min women do not have the same right.Yakoob, Mir p. 166 The musta'min are subject to civil and criminal law in the territory and may not do or say anything that could be construed as harming the interests of Islam.Khadduri p. 168 If caught doing so, the musta'min could be expelled or executed and the amaan grantor could also be penalized.

Known as Cobb Island Road, the state highway runs from Cobb Island north to MD 257 near Rock Point. MD 254 connects the mainland to Cobb Island, which was originally established as a summer resort in the early 1920s, at the southern end of Charles County. The state highway was constructed as Maryland Route 533 in the early 1930s. The state highway was rebuilt and renumbered as MD 254 in the 1950s. Route description View north along MD 254 just north of Neale Sound MD 254 begins south of the intersection of Cobb Island Road and Neale Sound Drive on Cobb Island. Cobb Island Road continues south as a county- maintained two-lane divided avenue to Potomac River Drive on the Potomac River side of the island. North of Neale Sound Drive, MD 254 is a two-lane undivided road and leaves the island by crossing over Neale Sound on the Cobb Island Bridge. The state highway passes between marinas and curves northwest to parallel the coast. At Pine Grove Road, MD 254 veers north to its terminus at Rock Point Road. Rock Point Road heads southeast as a county highway toward Rock Point and northwest as MD 257 up Cobb Neck to U.S. Route 301 in Newburg. History The original bridge from the mainland to Cobb Island, a \\"noisy one-way wooden bridge that was prone to summer traffic jams,\\" was constructed in 1923 shortly after the establishment of the island as a summer resort by Robert Crain. In 1932, the Maryland State Roads Commission rebuilt Cobb Island Road as a modern gravel road and replaced the \\"hazardous\\" 1923 bridge with a creosoted timber bridge. This bridge was still one-lane, being wide, but had a passing area near the middle. Cobb Island Road was originally designated MD 533. MD 533 was widened to and resurfaced with bituminous stabilized gravel in 1951. MD 533 was renumbered MD 254 in 1958. MD 254 had originally been assigned to Davidsonville Road between Davidsonville and Edgewater in central Anne Arundel County; that highway was renumbered as an eastward extension of MD 214 (Central Avenue) by 1939.

A DCM is not always present - sometimes there is more chlorophyll at the surface than at any greater depth - but it is a common feature of most aquatic ecosystems, especially in regions of strong thermal stratification. The depth, thickness, intensity, composition, and persistence of DCMs vary widely. The DCM generally exists at the same depth as the nutricline, the region of the ocean where the greatest change in the nutrient concentration occurs with depth. A common way of determining the DCM is through the use of a CTD rosette, an underwater instrument that measures various parameters of water at specific depths. The location and formation of the DCM depends on multiple factors, such as the resident organisms' nutritional needs and light availability. Some organisms have adapted to lower levels of light through increasing its cellular chlorophyll amounts, and others have adapted by migrating vertically with varying nutrient and light levels. The DCM species composition vary with water chemistry, location, seasonality, and depth. Not only is there a difference in DCM species composition between oceans and lakes, variation is also present within different oceans and lakes. Because the DCM holds much of the world's primary productivity, it plays a significant role in nutrient cycling, the flow of energy, and biogeochemical cycles.  Measurements  Fig. 1 Field photo of a CTD rosette, which measures the conductivity, temperature, and pressure of water samples. The DCM is often located tens of meters below the surface, and cannot be observed by using traditional satellite remote sensing methods. Estimates of primary productivity are often made via these remote sensing methods coupled with statistical models, though these statistical calculations may not have accurately included production in the DCM. The DCM of a study area can be determined in-situ through the use of an underwater instrument (CTD rosette with niskin bottles) to measure various parameters such as salinity (including dissolved nutrients), temperature, pressure, and chlorophyll fluorescence. Collected water samples can be used to determine phytoplankton cell counts. These measurements can then be converted into chlorophyll concentrations, phytoplankton biomass, and phytoplankton productivity. Another way to estimate primary productivity in the DCM is to create a simulation of the DCM formation in a region by making a 3D model of the region. This can be done if sufficient hydrodynamic and biogeochemical data exists for that ocean region.  Location and formation  Since its initial discovery, oceanographers have presented various theories to explain the formation of deep chlorophyll maxima. = Abiotic factors = In-situ studies have determined that the depth of DCM formation is primarily dependent on light attenuation levels, and the depth of the nutricline, although thermal stratification also plays a role. In lakes, the thickness of the DCM layer is mainly controlled by the sizes and maximum depths of lakes. The DCM forms near the nutricline and the bottom of the photic zone. Phytoplankton growth in the DCM is limited by both nutrient and light availability, therefore either increased nutrient input, or increased light availability to the DCM can in turn increase the phytoplankton growth rate. The location and formation of the DCM also depends on season. In the Mediterranean Sea, the DCM is present in the summer due to water stratification, and is rare in the winter due to deep mixing. The DCM can be present at shallower depths in the winter and early spring due to light limitation and higher nutrient availability in shallower regions due to mixing, and at lower depths during the summer and early fall as nutrients in the surface water are depleted by primary producers and stronger irradiance allows light to penetrate to greater depths. = Biotic factors = The formation of a DCM correlates with a number of biological processes, affecting nutrient cycling for local heterotrophic bacteria and composition of specialized phytoplankton.  Adaptations to light levels  Fig. 2. Example of the level of chlorophyll fluorescence at different water depths. Light attenuation factors have been shown to be quite predictive of the DCM depth, since the phytoplankton present in the region require sufficient sunlight for growth, resulting in a DCM that is generally found in the euphotic zone. However, if the phytoplankton population has adapted to lower light environments, the DCM can also be located in the aphotic zone. The high chlorophyll concentration at the DCM is due to the high number of phytoplankton that have adapted to functioning in low light conditions. To adapt to low light conditions, some phytoplankton populations have been found to have increased amounts of chlorophyll counts per cell, which contributes to the formation of the DCM. Rather than an increase of overall cell numbers, seasonal light limitation or low irradiance levels can raise the individual cellular chlorophyll content. As depth increases within the mixing zone, phytoplankton must rely on having higher pigment counts (chlorophyll) to capture photic energy. Due to the higher concentration of chlorophyll in the phtoplankton present, the DCM does not predict the depth of the biomass maximum in the same region. In addition, compared to shallower regions of the mixing zone, the DCM has high nutrient concentrations and/or lower respiratory, grazing, and death rates which further promote phytoplankton cell production.  Vertical migration  Vertical migration, or movement of phytoplankton within the water column, contributes to the establishment of the DCM due to the diversity of resources required by the phytoplankton. Dependent on factors like nutrients and available light, some phytoplankton species will intentionally move to different depths to fulfill their physiological requirements. A mechanism employed by certain phytoplankton, such as certain species of diatoms and cyanobacteria, is to regulate their own buoyancy to move through the water column. Other species such as dinoflagellates use their flagella to swim to their desired depth. This intentional movement of phytoplankton contributes to the formation of the DCM in areas where these species make up a significant proportion of the phytoplankton community. Generally these species are larger in size and are not found in significant abundance in nutrient poor regions, so these physiological aspects of phytoplankton contribute less to DCM formation in oligotrophic waters. In lakes, the thickness of the DCM shows positive correlations with lake sizes. However, due to the great diversity of lakes, there is no constant factor for light and temperature that can be utilized to predict DCM depths across different lake types.  Composition  The composition of microorganisms present in the DCM varies significantly with geographical location, season, and depth. The species of phytoplankton present in the DCM varies with depth due to varying accessory pigmentation. Some phytoplankton species have accessory pigments, compounds that have adapted them to gather light energy from certain wavelengths of light, even in areas of low light penetration. To optimize light energy collection, phytoplankton will move to specific depths to access different wavelengths of visible light. The difference in phytoplankton composition between the epilimnion layer and the DCM are consistent throughout several bodies of water. The DCM tends to harbour more flagellated organisms and cryptophytes, whereas the epilimnion layer tends to have a larger centric diatom abundance. = Oceans = In the Northwestern Mediterranean, the most abundant phytoplankton present are coccolithophorids, flagellates, and dinoflagellates. The Southeastern Mediterranean has a similar composition, where coccolithophorids and monads (nano- and picoplankton) make up the majority of the phytoplankton community in the DCM. In the Indian Ocean, the most abundant microorganisms present in the DCM are cyanobacteria such as prochlorophytes, coccolithophorids, dinoflagellates and diatoms. In the North Sea, dinoflagellates are the main phytoplankton species present in the DCM at and below the pycnocline. In shallower parts of the DCM - above the pycnocline, dinoflagellates are also present, as well as nanoflagellates. = Lakes =  Lake Superior  The DCM of clear, stratified water is commonly found below the epilimnion. Lake Superior is one of the world's largest freshwater lakes, and in the summer, its DCM ranges from approximately 20 m to 35 m below the surface. Although the epilimnion and DCM are neighbouring layers of water, the species composition of the epilimnion and the DCM differ almost entirely. These differences include the presence of less centric diatoms, more pennate diatoms, cryptophytes, and pyrrophytes at the DCM compared to the epilimnion layer. Additionally, the most significant difference in between these two layers is the abundance of Cyclotella comta, which occurs much less in the DCM. Much more of the DCM community are flagellated (e.g. cryptophytes and pyrrophytes) compared to those of the epilimnion. As flagellated species are better swimmers, this could explain how they are able to reside at their desired depth, the DCM. Another factor for the development of the DCM is nutrient availability. It has been found that the DCM had a lower ratio of particulate organic carbon (POC) to phosphorus (P) than the epilimnion. Since phosphorus is one of the limiting factors for growth, especially in Lake Superior during stratified times, this phenomenon may indicate that phytoplankton in the DCM is more enriched with phosphorus than in the epilimnion. The higher availability of phosphorus may have allowed more phytoplankton to prefer the DCM even with the lower amount of light compared to the epilimnion. On the other hand, the fact that the DCM has lower light availability could be used to argue that the lower POC:P ratio is due to light limitation rather than increased nutrient (P) concentrations.  Lake Tahoe  In Lake Tahoe, the DCM is unique, as the depth of the region is much lower than normal, present at around 90-110 metres below the surface. Typically, DCM's are found closely below the thermocline, which is present at around 30-40 metres. Lake Tahoe represents a chlorophyll gradient similar to that of oligotrophic areas, such that the depth of the region is dependent on seasonal fluctuations. Due to these temporal shifts, especially between spring and summer, Lake Tahoe's phytoplankton communities undergo distinct changes. During the spring months, the DCM coincides with the upper surface of the nitracline, making the water nutrient-rich for diatoms Cyclotella striata and crysophytes Dinobryon bavaricum to thrive in. During the summer months, the DCM deepens, and productivity within the layer almost becomes entirely light dependent. Similar to the chlorophyll structures found in oceans, the DCM becomes incredibly fluid and variable, such that certain phytoplankton species (diatoms Synedra ulna, Cyclotella comta and green flagellates) begin to dominate, despite being absent during the spring productivity period. Overall, the phytoplankton community between the epilimnion and the DCM in Lake Tahoe differ with size. Both regions are abundant with diatoms; small diatoms (cell volume = 30.5Œºm¬≥) such as Cyclotella stelligera, Synedra radians make up the majority in the epilimnion, while larger diatoms (cell volume = 416.3Œºm¬≥) such as C.ocellata, Stephanodiscus alpinus, Fragilaria crotonensis, dominate the DCM.  Lakes of the North Patagonian Andean Region  Lakes of the North Patagonian Andean Region can be divided into larger deeper lakes and smaller shallow lakes. Although these lakes are found in the same region, they exhibit different conditions leading to varying DCM species compositions. The large deep lakes are ultra-oligotrophic, as they are very transparent and contain low DOC and nutrients. Unlike the homogenous thermal profile of the shallower lakes, deeper lakes undergo strong thermal stratification during the late spring and summer. The two lake types also differ in light attenuation coefficients: it is lower in the transparent deeper lakes, which means more light is able to penetrate though. As such, the main difference between the two lake types that was found to contribute to the DCM community is the light climate. Shallow lakes were found to contain greater concentrations of dissolved yellow particles than the deeper lakes. As a result, for deeper lakes, maximum absorption wavelengths were mainly at the red end of the spectra, whereas shallow lakes exhibited green and blue absorption wavelengths in addition to red. At the DCM region of the large deep lakes, the mixotrophic ciliate Ophrydium naumanni were dominant. Their phototrophic abilities come from their endosymbiotic algae Chlorella, which are strong competitors in poor light conditions. In addition, the ciliates can undergo phagotrophy to obtain other necessary elements. In shallower lakes, O. naumanni were found to be absent, likely due to higher levels of competition with phytoplankton and turbulence intensity.  Ecological implications  The DCM plays an important ecological role in harbouring much of the world's primary production, and in nutrient cycling. In oligotrophic waters, like the North Sea and the Mediterranean Sea, the DCM is where over half of the overall primary production occurs due to phytoplankton growth. The high rate of primary production in the DCM facilitates nutrient cycling to higher trophic levels in the mixed layer. The DCM forms at the same depth as the nuricline, so phytoplankton in the DCM can access nutrients coming up from the deep ocean. The phytoplankton in the DCM can then cycle back up the water column providing nutrients for heterotrophs in the mixed layer. Since the DCM environment plays a fundamental role in primary productivity, it can be associated with many aspects of aquatic predator-prey interactions, energy and biomass flow, and biogeochemical cycles. Significant export of organic material from the water column occurs due to the DCM, as heterotrophs consume phytoplankton in the DCM and the fecal matter of grazers sinks to the deep ocean. The DCM is an important food source for secondary producers as it has a relatively high concentration of primary producers at one region of the water column. This makes it easier and faster for grazers to find and consume phytoplankton which in turn increases the rate of movement of energy through the trophic levels.

In April 1862, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. During the Peninsula Campaign and at Second Manassas his regiment was a part of Howell Cobb's brigade. At the Battle of Antietam, MacRae commanded the brigade which had been reduced to 250 men during the fighting over the previous few weeks. MacRae's brigade repulsed three Union assaults but fell back when he had only 50 effectives remaining and his supply of ammunition was exhausted. At the Fredericksburg he fought with his regiment at Marye's Heights. Immediately following the battle the 15th North Carolina was transferred to Brigadier General John Rogers Cooke's North Carolina brigade. Cooke had been badly wounded at Fredericksburg and would not return to the brigade until April 1863. In February 1863, MacRae was promoted to colonel. This brigade served in North Carolina and southeast Virginia until after the Gettysburg Campaign. in February, 1863, colonel, and in 1864 was commissioned brigadier-general. After rejoining the Army of Northern Virginia, MacRae was distinguished for valor at the Battle of Bristoe Station. After Brigadier General William Whedbee Kirkland was wounded at the Battle of Cold Harbor MacRae was temporarily promoted to the rank of brigadier general and was assigned to the command of Kirkland's brigade (this was also the former brigade of Brigadier General J.

The party discussed in 2008 if they should support the ticket of Lugo in the presidential election or share the candidacy with him; the second option prevailed and Franco ran for the vice-presidency under Lugo's ticket. He was critical of the presidency of Lugo, such as with the management of lands and the 2009 controversy about Lugo's son. Lugo was impeached on 21 June 2012 and removed from office a day later. The UNASUR expressed concerns that Lugo's removal amounted to a coup d'√©tat, since Lugo had only two hours to prepare a defense. Federico Franco then became the new president, taking the oath of office an hour later. He completed Lugo's mandate, which lasted until August 2013.

Established in 1946, ELEC was one of the founding members of the European Movement in 1948. It is built as a federation of national sections present in a number of European countries. The membership of its national sections is drawn largely from economic and financial circles; but it also maintains close contacts with senior national and European civil servants as well as academics and policy makers, whose expertise and influence stimulate the exchanges and broaden their scope and quality. ELEC has advisory status at the Council of Europe and on the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe. History The European League for Economic Cooperation was founded in 1946 by Paul Van Zeeland (Belgium), J√≥zef Retinger (Poland) and Pieter Kerstens (the Netherlands). They were rapidly joined by other people such as Edmond Giscard d'Estaing (France), Harold Butler (United Kingdom) and Hermann Abs (Germany). It has never been a mass movement, although it was present at The Hague in 1948 among the founding organisations of the European Movement. Open to all ELEC members, there are several working commissions covering various areas of economic activity and cooperation in Europe such as Economic & Social, Mediterranean and Monetary. It is in the commissions that ELEC's essential research is carried out, as well as the drafting of position papers that give rise to various publications. They frequently call on external experts to present the issues which they examine. The Monetary and the Mediterranean commissions organize from time to time conferences, which are open to a larger public, including non-ELEC members. The \\"Kronberg Monetary Conference\\" is ELEC's flagship in this respect. From the very first years of its existence, ELEC showed a keen interest for the monetary aspects of European integration which remained unabated ever since. On 14 July 1956, the Monetary Commission convened for the first time in the Schlosshotel in Kronberg (north of Frankfurt), at Deutsche Bank's invitation and under Hermann J. Abs' presidency, in order to examine the monetary conditions of the common market. It was the first in a long series of yearly gatherings at this same location, stretching almost without interruption for more than half a century. Off the record, prestigious speakers of big European banks, central bank governors, European commissioners and high officials, influential members of the European Parliament, and members of the board of the European Central Bank shared their thoughts with ELEC members, leading to animated discussions. ECB President Jean-Claude Trichet in person was a regular guest of the ‚ÄúKronberg\\" meetings. After 2007, other important European banks took over as a host of this gathering that is still called the ‚ÄúKronberg‚Äù Conference. ING Group hosted a conference on March 5 and 6, 2009, in Amsterdam, and once again on November 13, 2011, in The Hague. Rabo Bank is set to sponsor the next conference. Organisation First and foremost, ELEC hinges on its national sections, which enjoy considerable autonomy in recruiting their members, assembling their financial resources and organising their own activities. It is mainly through national sections that members are attracted to ELEC and participate in its national and international activities. The Central Council, which is ELEC's managing body, brings together twice a year the presidents of national sections in activity and individual members elected for their personal contribution to ELEC, under the leadership of the International President. It alone is empowered to adopt resolutions in ELEC's name and to circulate them by whatever means it chooses. This is also the forum in which the programmes of ELEC's working commissions are debated and approved, and their work evaluated. Open to all ELEC members, there are several commissions covering various areas of economic activity and cooperation in Europe of which the most important are : Economic & Social, Mediterranean and Monetary. It is in the commissions that ELEC's essential research is carried out, as well as the drafting of position papers that give rise to various publications. They frequently call on external experts to present the issues which they examine. ELEC is financed through yearly contributions of the national sections.

The club is affiliated with the Cork GAA county board and the Avondhu divisional board. History Charleville or Rathluirc GAA club was founded in 1888, and was drawn against Ballyhea in the championship that year. In 1914 the club had its first success winning the county Middle Grade (Intermediate) hurling championship. In the early 1930s, after experiencing some lean years, the club decided to run street leagues for the whole parish initially at adult level and later at minor level. These games were often fiercely contested as the pride of a particular part of the town was at stake. In 1937 a separate club named Se√°n Clarach was set up to oversee the minor age group. The club won its first North Cork Junior hurling title in 1945 beating Ballyhooly in the final, and lost to the Duhallow champions in the county semi-final, played at Kanturk. A decision was taken after winning the North Cork junior hurling championship in 1945 to enter in the Intermediate grade for the following year. This led to the club's greatest achievement on the field winning the Cork Intermediate Hurling Championship in 1946 and again in 1947. The club played in the Cork Senior Hurling Championship from 1948 to 1952 and reached one county semi-final (1950). They played Intermediate from 1953 onwards losing the county final to Glen Rovers in 1958. They reverted to the Junior grade in 1960 and won the Avondhu title in 1970, beating Liscarroll. The 2010s has been the club's most successful to date. In 2011 they won the North Cork Junior A Hurling Championship and later added the Cork Junior Hurling Championship for the first time, they would then go on to win the Munster Junior Club Hurling Championship.

This was followed up with a first ever Cork Premier Intermediate Hurling Championship in 2018, seeing the club back in the senior grade for the first time since 1952.

The battle took place between an Egyptian army, headed by Ahmed ‚ÄòUrabi, and British forces headed by Sir Archibald Alison. As a result, the British abandoned any hope they may have had of reaching Cairo from the north, and shifted their base of operations to Ismailia instead.  Prelude  After the bombardment of Alexandria on 11 July, the city was occupied by a mixed force of sailors and marines. The Egyptians withdrew to Kafr El Dawwar, where they began the construction of an entrenched camp which would block the route to Cairo. ‚ÄòUrabi demanded that one-sixth of the male population of every province should be sent to Kafr El Dawwar. All old soldiers of every description were called upon to serve again, and horses and provisions were everywhere requisitioned for the army. On 17 July, Sir Archibald Alison landed in Alexandria with the leading elements of the British expeditionary force: the South Staffordshire Regiment and a battalion of the King's Royal Rifle Corps. Combined with a battalion of Royal Marine Light Infantry and a substantial number of sailors from ships in the harbour, Alison's force numbered 3,755 men, seven 9-pounder and two 7-pounder guns, six Gatlings and four rocket tubes. He sent patrols in all directions to ascertain the strength and location of the Egyptians, but remained based within the city. Alison was reinforced on 24 July by the arrival of the Duke of Cornwall's Light Infantry, a wing of the Royal Sussex Regiment and a battery of artillery ‚Äî a total of 1,108 men. He immediately advanced to occupy Ramleh where he established a fortified base. Egyptian forces in the area were later estimated as four regiments of infantry, one of cavalry and several batteries of artillery ‚Äî totalling 12,000 to 15,000 men and outnumbering the garrison of Alexandria by at least four to one.  Battle  This map shows the main features of the countryside around Alexandria during the Anglo-Egyptian War of 1882 Seeking to ascertain the strength of the Kafr El Dawwar position, and to test local rumours that the Egyptians were retreating, Alison ordered a probing attack on the evening of 5 August 1882. The line of attack would follow the Cairo railway line and the Mahmoudiyah Canal which led, roughly parallel to each other, towards ‚ÄòUrabi's trenches. Armoured train with Nordenfelt gun The British force was split into two wings: The left wing would follow the canal. It comprised four companies each of the South Staffordshire and Duke of Cornwall's regiments (800 men in all), accompanied by a naval 9-pounder gun and 80 mounted infantry who would operate on the East bank. On the West bank were six companies of Rifles (500 men) and another 9-pounder. The right wing would follow the railway line and was made up of 1,000 marines. It was supported by an armoured train, the brainchild of Captain Jacky Fisher, which sported a 40-pounder gun, a Nordenfelt, two Gatlings and two more nine- pounders. The whole force, including 200 sailors manning the train and the 9-pounders, numbered around 2,600 men. Facing them in the Egyptian forward lines were a battalion of the Second Infantry, a regiment 1,200 strong, and 900 men of the Mustaphezin Regiment. They could draw on artillery and other support from the main Egyptian position. The forces on the Eastern bank of the canal advanced with the mounted infantry leading the way under the command of Captain Parr and Lieutenants Pigott and Vyse. When these three officers, accompanied by six men, rode ahead to reconnoitre, they chanced upon a large body of Egyptians who immediately opened fire - mortally wounding Vyse, killing another man and wounding two others. Private Frederick Corbett stepped forward and attempted to staunch the bleeding of the officer's wounds whilst under a constant fire from the Egyptians, but to no avail: Vyse had been shot through the Femoral artery and bled to death in 10 minutes. The party was ordered to retire, and did so carrying Vyse's body with them. Corbett was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his actions. On the West bank of the canal, facing the Rifles, a large number of Egyptian troops occupied a ditch running across their front, behind which was a thick covering of bush. The Rifles advanced in skirmish order using fire and movement tactics to draw closer to their enemy. The 9-pounder kept pace with them along the canal towpath, firing the occasional shrapnel shell into the Egyptian position. The Egyptians maintained a steady but inaccurate fire, with most of their bullets passing harmlessly over the heads of their attackers. When the Rifles got to within 100 yards of the ditch, Egyptians could already be seen creeping off in twos and threes into the bush behind their position. When the order was given for the Rifles to fix bayonets and charge, the remaining defenders took flight, many throwing away their arms in the process. At this point, the British left wing was ordered to halt. The commander of this part of the force - Colonel Thackwell of the South Staffordshires - had been ordered to advance until he reached a white house on the canal bank, which marked the closest point of the canal to the railway. Unfortunately for the British, there was another white house a mile short of their target which Colonel Thackwell mistook for his objective. The mistake would have serious consequences for the other British column. The right wing came into position by rail, with the armoured train leading the way and the marines riding in a second train behind. Just beyond Mahalla Junction the railway line was broken, so the Marines disembarked and advanced under the cover of the railway embankment. The Egyptians, having trained their artillery on the break in the line in advance, opened fire on the armoured train. The British 40-pounder and two 9-pounders replied until they had silenced the Egyptian batteries. The 9-pounders then accompanied the marines in their advance, whilst the 40-pounder continued to give supporting fire from the armoured train. As the marines drew ahead of the halted left column, they came under fire on their left flank from Egyptian soldiers posted along the banks of the canal. Seeing they were unsupported, the marines charged across the intervening ground, firing a volley before closing with fixed bayonets. The Egyptians fled in all directions, many being shot down or drowning in the canal as they attempted to reach safety. The British were now deployed in a diagonal line across both the canal and the railway. Whilst a strong Egyptian force on the East bank of the canal maintained a fierce fire fight with the marines, General Alison (who had accompanied the right column) was able to survey the Egyptian fortifications. This he did for a period of about 45 minutes. At about 6:30pm, with the light failing and Egyptian reinforcements visibly appearing, a general withdrawal was ordered and carried out with great coolness and precision. By 8pm, all were out of action. British casualties were one officer and three men killed and 27 wounded, 24 of the latter being from the right hand column. Egyptian losses, according to a deserter taken four days later, were three officers and 76 men killed and a large number wounded. An Egyptian officer and 14 men were taken prisoner Total Egyptian casualties have been estimated at 200 men.  Reaction  The action was reported by ‚ÄòUrabi as a battle, and Cairo was full of the news that the advancing British had been repulsed. In London, The Times reported that \\"the result is felt by all concerned to be satisfactory\\". US military observer Caspar Goodrich, who could take a slightly less partisan view, later expressed this opinion: > Beyond the moral effect on the attacking force of a successful brush with > the enemy, the reconnaissance in force was barren of results. The strength > of the Egyptians was neither developed nor ascertained, nor was the position > held from which they had been driven. The balance of advantages seems to be > negative [for the British]; valuable lives were sacrificed, and the enemy > regained the ground he had lost without suffering severely enough to be > seriously affected. Subsequently, the action was described by one historian as a \\"British attempt to break through at Kafr Ed-Dawar [which] ended in failure\\" Most others, like Goodrich, describe it merely as a reconnaissance in force which was never intended as a serious assault on the Egyptian lines.  Aftermath  British troops continued to arrive at Alexandria over the following days, with the Commander-in-Chief Sir Garnet Wolseley himself arriving on 15 August. Two days later, Wolseley ordered the re-embarkation of many of his troops, and let it be known that he planned to land his forces in Aboukir Bay from where they could take the Egyptian works in the flank. On 19 August the fleet set sail, and 18 ships anchored in the bay in preparation for the supposed attack. At 8pm, though, a signal was given and the fleet proceeded eastward to Port Said. The whole affair had been a ruse, intended to draw ‚ÄòUrabi's forces towards Alexandria, and to distract him from Wolseley's real intended base of operations on the Suez Canal. It succeeded admirably, and the British were able to establish themselves at Isma√Ølia without incident. Whether Wolseley ever seriously intended to advance on Cairo direct from Alexandria is doubtful, with at least one account suggesting that he always expected the decisive battle to be fought at Tel El Kebir. Wolseley left a division at Ramleh to guard Alexandria, under the command of Sir Edward Hamley. This force was made up of two brigades. The first, under Sir Archibald Alison, comprised one battalion of Royal Highlanders and two battalions each of the Highland Light Infantry, Gordon Highlanders and Cameron Highlanders; the second, under Sir Evelyn Wood, comprised one battalion each of the Sussex Regiment, Berkshire Regiment, South Staffordshire regiment and King's Shropshire Light Infantry. On 29 August Hamley, Alison and his brigade were ordered to join the main British force, leaving Wood's brigade to garrison Ramleh alone. Fighting around Kafr al-Dawar broke out several times in August 1882. The Egyptians continued to menace Alexandria, whilst the British made occasional sorties to reconnoitre their position. But the Alexandria front had become a side-show, the decisive fighting of the war was taking place along the Sweet Water Canal. ‚ÄòUrabi's army was decisively defeated at Tel El Kebir on 13 September, and Cairo surrendered to the British on the following day. The works at Kafr El Dawwar were given up without a fight to Sir Evelyn Wood on 16 September. They were found to be exceptionally strong, with successive lines of ditches and embankments, covered walkways, gun positions, redoubts and embrasures, well stocked with modern Krupp artillery and arms and ammunition of all kinds. Held by determined defenders, they would have been extremely difficult to take.

Story When a North Korean man is pushed to the edge by his daughter's senseless death, he risks his life to challenge the oppressive government, making his voice heard through an extreme and unusual action. Synopsis Deface is the story of Sooyoung, a faceless factory worker in a small town in North Korea who stays quiet and follows the rules. But when his daughter dies of starvation, Sooyoung is driven by his outrage to vandalize the large propaganda posters that decorate the town with happy, assuring slogans. Sooyoung risks his life to deface the billboards, repainting the messages to reflect the harsh reality of life in North Korea, and desecrating the images of Kim Il-Sung and Kim Jong-Il. He manages to avoid capture by the newly formed ‚ÄúAnti-Graffiti‚Äù patrol, but when he sees that his act of protest leads to the arrest of local innocents, he must question to what end do his rebellious actions really serve. Sooyoung is captured and executed by the authorities, but his actions inspire similar defiance in others.

Designed by Paul Tournon, decorated by many major artists of the day, and consecrated in 1932, the church is considered one of the most significant examples of modern ecclesiastical design in France. History Beginning in 1925, the Catholic Church initiated a program called the Chantiers du Cardinal, through which it would build churches in undesirable areas and Christianize the red-light districts around Paris. Most of these churches were built of cement and brick. In 1930, Cardinal Jean Verdier decided to take the program even further, decreeing that it would be necessary, over the next few years, to construct a hundred churches for the diocese. The success of Verdier's plan was total; in 1933 the sixtieth construction site was inaugurated, and in 1934 alone seventeen more were opened. In total, 102 churches, including Notre-Dame-des-Missions, were built around Paris before 1940, when the program finished. The construction of the church was an outgrowth of an exhibit which had been put together for a 1931 colonial exhibition in the Bois de Vincennes. The vault of the structure was constructed as a chapel for Catholic missions expressly for the exhibit, and was dismantled at its end. It was then reconstructed using more durable materials in 1933 in √âpinay-sur-Seine; funds for the building's construction were raised through a national subscription spearheaded by Marshal Hubert Lyautey. The church received its unusual double name from its origins and from the site of its construction; as the colonial exhibition was designed to glorify the evangelization of French colonies by missionaries, it was decided to dedicate the structure to Our Lady of the Missions. The rest of the name refers to the northwestern district of √âpinay-sur-Seine, the so-called \\"Swan of Enghien\\", in which the church was built. The land upon which it sits was donated by Firmin-Dodot. Design right The architecture of the church is meant to recall the civilizations that were served by the Christian missions; the building is distinguished from many contemporary works through its use of reinforced concrete. Its architect, Paul Tournon, had already designed another church in the vicinity, that of Saint-Louis in Villemomble. At Notre-Dame-des- Missions, Tournon took his inspiration from the architecture of five continents. The fa√ßade of the church is designed with three roofs at the entrance, superimposed one upon another in the Chinese style and decorated with Chinese ideographs. To these are added recumbent angels, Buddhist figures, fetishistic objects, and African-inspired designs. The bell tower is designed in the shape of a minaret. The whole facade is covered in blue and white ceramic tile in a pattern created by Lorymi and Raymond Virac, using a new type of brickwork developed in 1930 by Marguerite Hur√©. The cement sculptures on the bell tower, depicting the four human races, were sculpted by Carlos Sarrabezolles, who had previously worked with Tournon on the bell tower at Saint-Louis. At the top of the tower is a statue of the Virgin Mary standing on a globe; it is the work of Roger de Villiers. Many painters, sculptors and glassworkers participated in the decoration of the inside of the church; most of these artists came from the studios of sacred art founded by Maurice Denis, who had designed the windows for the nearby Notre-Dame du Raincy, and of George Desvalli√®res. It was important that as a group the artists achieved unity of style, and the results of their collaboration comprise one of the most outstanding examples of French ecclesiastical decoration of the 1930s. Louis Barillet and his studio realized the design of some of the stained glass windows, which depict important figures in the history of evangelization. These are grouped around a figure of Christ as Missionary designed by Jean H√©bert-Stevens. Among the other notable artists to work on the stained glass in the church were Andr√© Rinuy, Marguerite Hur√©, and Pauline Peugniez. right Important painters were engaged to create the frescos for the church. Chief among these was Henri de Maistre, who illustrated the Christianization of the world after the Resurrection in a series of paintings crafted for the building's side chapels. He chose to depict various French martyrs in his design, placing them against a map showing the great lakes and important cities of Canada. A panel showing the Christianization of southern Algeria and of the Sahara Desert by Charles de Foucauld was created for the interior by Georges Desvalli√®res. A series of murals, on the right side of the church building, was painted by Raymond Virac, Lucien Simon, and Robert-Albert G√©nicot; these celebrate the evangelical work done in Indochina and India by Francis Xavier and that done in Japan by Alphonsus Navarette. Charles Plessard and Pauline Peugniez contributed work inspired by the Irish missions of Columba. On the left-hand side of the church may be found depictions of the Christianizatin of ancient Greece, ancient Rome, Gaul, England, Germany, and the Slavic world. Maurice Denis was the most famous artist to contribute to this series; he was aided by Henri-Justin Marret, Valentine Reyre, Paul de Laboulaye, and Georges Ballot. Eight colossal stone sculptures, which lean against the partition walls of the vaults of the church and which depict the Eight Blessings of Saint Matthew, are the work of Raymond Delamarre, a sculptor known for his work in large forms, and of Anne-Marie Roux-Colas, each of whom contributed four to the final product. The church of Notre-Dame-des- Missions-du-Cygne d‚ÄôEnghien was listed as a Historic Monument of France on June 14, 1994. , restoration work on the structure was ongoing.

The site includes the reconstructed Fort William Henry, archaeological remains of 17th- and 18th-century village buildings and fortifications, and a museum with artifacts found on the site including musket balls, coins, pottery, and early hardware. Pemaquid was a major regional flashpoint in the late 17th-century and early 18th-century conflicts between English and French settlers, and between English settlers and the local Native population. The site has been of historical and archaeological interest since the late 19th century and has been a state park since 1903. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1969 (as \\"Pemaquid Restoration and Museum\\") and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1993 (as \\"Pemaquid Archeological Site\\"). Description Colonial Pemaquid is set on a small north-facing peninsula on the south side of the mouth of the Pemaquid River, north of Pemaquid Point, a spit of land in mid-coast Maine. The site is mostly level or gently sloping terrain that has been covered in grass. The site is accessed via a drive from the south, which provides access to parking areas above the main historic settlement area. There is a 20th-century building housing a visitor center and small museum, an 18th-century house that has been repurposed for use as an archaeological laboratory and storage space, and the reconstructed bastion of Fort William Henry at the northwestern tip of the peninsula. The eastern portion of the site is where the major colonial village was located, and is now only visible as a series of depressions in the grass. The western portion of the site is where Fort William Henry, the 17th-century fortification, and Fort Frederick, the 18th-century fortification, were located. Foundational remnants of some of the buildings remain. Archaeological remains have been judged to have a high state of preservation, since many remains were deep enough to avoid damage when the area was used for agriculture, and those same farming practices resulted in the filling in of cellar holes, further preserving cultural artifacts there. History Pemaquid has a colonial settlement history dating to the early decades of the 17th century, with a succession of conflicts leading the site to be attacked on several occasions and entirely abandoned twice. The area was used by English and French traders and fishermen on a seasonal basis for some time, and the first documented permanent residence was established in 1628. The Pemaquid peninsula, located between the mouth of the Kennebec River in the west and Penobscot Bay to the east, was considered by the French as part of Acadia, which they claimed extended to the Kennebec. The early English settlers traded with English settlements further south, as well as the local Abenaki people and the French, sometimes in opposition to the policies of the formal New England colonies to the south. In 1664 the area was granted by King Charles II to his brother James, Duke of York, and was made part of the Province of New York. At this time the settlement was reported to have less than 30 houses. By 1673, when the area came under the jurisdiction of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, there were more than 40 houses and 150-200 residents. King Philip's War, a major conflict that engulfed New England in 1675, resulted in attacks on Pemaquid and its outlying settlements, and the community was abandoned in 1676. New York authorities reasserted control over the area after the war, and established a formal administration, granting monopoly trading rights to a few favored residents. In 1688 the area was folded into the Dominion of New England. The Dominion governor Edmund Andros built a wooden fort in 1688, which did not prevent the community from being sacked at the outbreak of King William's War in 1689 by a combined force of French and Indians. The Dominion of New England collapsed in 1692, and Massachusetts authorities constructed the stone Fort William Henry in that year at great expense. Ongoing hostile relations with both the Natives and the French resulted in continued low-level conflict, which elevated in 1696 to a major attack on the settlement in 1696, in which French colonial forces and Indians were assisted by French naval forces in capturing and razing the settlement. Pemaquid would not be resettled until 1729 due to ongoing Native resistance that was not quelled until the 1720s Dummer's War. In 1729 David Dunbar, a local crown representative and entrepreneur, sought to establish an colony of Irish settlers called \\"Georgia\\" at Pemaquid, and constructed Fort Frederick. Massachusetts political leaders opposed this attempt to establish another colony, and successfully petitioned the king to regain control of the area. Settlers remained, but the area's military importance declined, especially after New France fell in 1759 during the French and Indian War. Fort Frederick was demolished by local authorities during the American Revolutionary War to prevent its use by British troops, and the area became a rural backwater. Historical interest in the area was stimulated in the late 19th century, and early archaeological investigation uncovered the foundations of the fort. The state acquired the site in 1903, and the large circular bastion of Fort William Henry was reconstructed (based on Colonel Wolfgang William Romer's drawings dating to 1699) in 1908. The site was investigated by archaeologist Warren K. Moorehead in the 1920s, but systematic investigation of the site did not begin until the 1960s, and continues to this day.

Steam Vessel Ardent - Arriving at Trieste from Alexandria with the Indian Despatches 28 September 1846 HMS Ardent was a wooden Alecto-class paddle sloop, and the fourth ship of the Royal Navy to use the name. She was launched on 12 February 1841 at Chatham and spent much of her career on the West Coast of Africa engaged in anti-slavery operations. One of the ship's company, Gunner John Robarts, was awarded the Victoria Cross for the destruction of Russian food stores in the Crimean War. She was scrapped in 1865. Design and construction Ardent was ordered on 25 February 1839 as the third of a class of 5 third-class steam vessels. She was laid down in February 1840, and on 15 August orders were received to hasten her building and to complete her as a packet. She was launched on 12 February 1841. She was long on the gundeck and displaced 878 tons. Power for her paddles came from a Seaward & Capel 2-cylinder direct-acting steam engine developing 200 nominal horsepower, which was fitted at Woolwich in February 1841. Having conducted engine trials in the River Thames in April 1841, she left Woolwich for Chatham to be fitted out. She was commissioned for the first time at Chatham on 16 September 1842. Service history She sailed for South America and the Cape station from Portsmouth on 1 October 1841, touching at Madeira during her passage. In 1845 she transferred from the Brazilian station to the West Coast of Africa, where she was involved in the long campaign to put down the slave trade. On 25 March 1845 detained the Spanish slave brigantine Dos Hermanos off the Pongo River, which was condemned on 9 April 1845 by the Mixed British and Spanish Court at Sierra Leone. She returned to England in September 1845. In 1848, she was serving in the Mediterranean, On 21 December, she rescued the survivors of , which had been wrecked at Chioggia, Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia with the loss of five of her crew. She saw active service during the Crimean War. On 29 May 1855 in the Sea of Azov, Crimea, Gunner Robarts of Ardent with two lieutenants (Cecil William Buckley of Miranda and Hugh Talbot Burgoyne of Swallow) volunteered to land on a beach where the Russian army were in strength. They were out of covering gunshot range of the ships offshore and met considerable enemy opposition, but managed to set fire to corn stores and ammunition dumps and destroy enemy equipment before embarking again. They were each awarded the Victoria Cross. She returned to Portsmouth on 5 February 1856 and sailed for the West Coast of Africa on 28 December 1857 for anti-slavery duties. The station was notorious for sickness, and during the year 1858 she reported 238 cases of sickness during the year(from a ship's company numbering less than 150), with 10 cases serious enough to require the individuals affected to be invalided home. She returned to the United Kingdom in March 1859 and by 1860 had returned to South America. Fate Ardent was sold to Castle and arrived at Charlton for breaking on 2 March 1865.Winfield (2004), pp.159-160.

Air France's music has been described as \\"post-rave bliss\\", \\"beach foam pop\\", and \\"Balearic disco\\", although Karlsson said that the Balearic movement \\"is something I can't relate to at all\\". History =Formation= Air France were formed in Gothenburg in 2005 by two longtime friends, Joel Karlsson and Henrik Markstedt. The duo were strongly influenced by dance music and acts such as Saint Etienne. The band's first track, \\"Behind Cabin Curtains\\", was lost after a hard drive crash. They were joined by Elisabet Sj√∂gren in 2006 after the duo decided that they needed a female vocalist. The band initially stated that they would not play any live shows, although they later changed their stance. =On Trade Winds= Air France were eventually noticed by Sincerely Yours founder Eric Berglund, resulting in the band signing to the label. In December 2006, they released their first EP On Trade Winds, which received moderate attention. \\"Afraid You Told Someone About Us\\", a cover of a song by Au Revoir Simone, was released in April 2007, followed later that year by the single \\"Hold On to Me, Baby\\". =No Way Down= The band released their second EP No Way Down in June 2008 to favourable reviews from critics. Pitchfork gave the EP a rating of 8.6, listing it in their Best New Music column and eventually placing it at number 14 on their list of the 50 best albums of 2008. No Way Down initially only received a Swedish release, but it was later released in the United Kingdom at the end of the year by the label Something in Construction, alongside On Trade Winds. =Final recordings and split= Air France released the single \\"GBG Belongs to Us\\" in 2009. The single was accompanied by a dedicated website, which was eventually taken down when the band forgot to pay the domain hosting fee. Later that year, it was announced that the band had signed a publishing deal with XL Recordings, aiming to release their debut album in 2010. The album never materialised as the band were not satisfied with their output. In August 2011, a new track from the band, \\"It Feels Good to Be Around You\\", was released. In March 2012, Air France released a statement announcing that they had decided to break up.

The main reason behind this thinking is that successful recovery of a faulty service increases the assurance and confidence from the customer.Krishna, A., Dangayach, G. and Sharma, S. (2014). Service Recovery Paradox: The Success Parameters. Global Business Review, 15(2), pp.263-277. For example, a traveller's flight is cancelled. When she calls the airline, they apologise and offer her another flight of her choice on the same day, and a discount voucher against future travel. Under the service recovery paradox, the traveller is now happier with the airline, and more loyal to it, than she would have been had no problem occurred. Understanding SRP has been an important goal for both researchers and managers, as service failure is one of the main determinants of customer switching behavior and successful recovery from these failures is seen by some as critical for customer retention.McCollough, M., Berry, L. and Yadav, M. (2000). An Empirical Investigation of Customer Satisfaction after Service Failure and Recovery. Journal of Service Research, 3(2), pp.121-137. Recovery is especially important for service providers for whom ensuring an error-free service is impossible.Fisk, Raymond P., Stephen W. Brown, and Mary Jo Bitner (1993), Tracking the Evolution of the Services Marketing Literature, Journal of Retailing, 69 (Spring), 61-103. Background and history The term service recovery paradox was first coined in 1992 by McCollough and Bharadwaj who described a situation when customers post-failure satisfaction exceeded pre- failure satisfaction. The service recovery paradox contends that effective service recovery can go beyond merely maintaining customer satisfaction, but can also elevate it to a higher level, winning customers and engendering long term customer loyalty. They defined it as \\"a situation in which a consumer has experienced a problem which has been satisfactory resolved, and where the consumer subsequently rates their satisfaction to be equal to or greater than that in which no problem had occurred\\".McCollough, Michael A., and Sundar G. Bharadwaj. \\"The Recovery Paradox: An Examination of Customer Satisfaction in Relation to Disconfirmation, Service Quality, and Attribution Based Theories.\\" In Marketing Theory and Applications, edited by Chris T. Allen, 119. Chicago: American Marketing Association, 1992. Since the concept was introduced in the early 1990s, a number of empirical studies have sought to establish when and under what circumstances the paradox operates in practice. However, these studies report mixed findings.Vincent Magnini, P., Ford. J.B., Markowski, .P. and Honeycutt, E.D. Jnr, \\"The service recovery paradox: justifiable theory or smoldering myth?\\", Journal of Services Marketing, Vol. 21, No. 3, 2007, pp. 213 - 225, Stable URL: https://dx.doi.org/10.1108/08876040710746561 Before the term Service Recovery Paradox was first used, the concept of service recovery was described by Hart, Hessket and Sasser in the following terms:Hart, C., Heskett, J. and Sasser Jr., W., \\"The Profitable Art of Service Recovery,\\" Harvard Business Review, Vol. 68, no. 4, 1990, pp 148-156. \\"A good recovery can turn angry, frustrated customers into loyal ones. It can, in fact, create more goodwill than if things had gone smoothly in the first place‚Äù. It was also theorized that this concept could be used strategically to increase customer retention. Attribution of blame Service failures occur when service delivery falls short of customer expectations. Service failures are profoundly different to product failures in that service failures are far more personal with psychological outcomes. In the event of a service failure, customers will often seek to attribute blame. In attributing blame, customers typically consider three things:Hoffman, K.D and Bateson, J.E.G., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases, Cengage Learning, 2016, p. 352 * Locus: Who is responsible for the failure? * Stability: How likely is the failure to recur? * Controllability: Did the responsible party have control over the causes of the service failure? Blame may be attributed to: * the service organisation (system and personnel failures) * external sources (e.g. weather, volcanic eruption) * the customer who may have contributed, at least partially, to service failure In the aftermath of service failure, dissatisfied customers have five major courses of action open to them: * Do nothing ‚Äì suffer in silence, but the service provider‚Äôs reputation may deteriorate with the dissatisfied segment * Complain privately ‚Äì by, for example, spreading negative word-of-mouth about the company or by writing about the negative experience on social media * Complain - in some form to the service firm. * Take some kind of overt action with a third party e.g. complain to a consumer claims tribunal, or even launch a legal action to obtain redress. * Defect - simply not patronise the firm again‚Äîor spread negative word of mouth messages about the firm Lovelock, C., Patterson. P.G. and Walker, R.H., Services Marketing: An Asia-Pacific Perspective, Sydney, Pearson, 2001, p. 344 Research consistently shows that customers who blame external factors are more forgiving. However, customers who blame the service system are more likely to complain.Mostert, P., Pezter, F., and De Meyer, C., \\"A Theoretical and Empirical Investigation into Service Failure and Service Recover in the Restaurant Industry,\\" in Delener, N. (ed), Service Science Research, Strategy and Innovation,IGI Global, 2012, pp 88-89 When customers complain directly to the service provider, there is an opportunity to turn customers around, increase their satisfaction and win loyal customers. For this reason, companies should develop strategies for handling service failures. Types of service recovery responses  Service recovery consists of all the actions taken to move a customer from a state of dissatisfaction to a state of satisfaction, following a service failure. In the event that a service failure occurs, the service organisation's response has the potential to either create or reinforce a strong customer relationship or change a minor incident into a major distraction. Hence, the way that organisations respond can have a bearing on winning customers in the long term.Hoffman, K Douglas; Kelley, Scott W; Rotalsky, Holly M., \\"Tracking service failures and employee recovery efforts,\\" Journal of Services Marketing, Vol. 9., no. 2, 1995; 9, 2; pp 49-61 Service failures can be categorised according to the following typology:Hoffman, K.D and Bateson, J.E.G., Services Marketing: Concepts, Strategies and Cases, Cengage Learning, 2016, pp 352-357 * Responses to service delivery system failures: failures in the core service offering of the firm. * Responses to customer needs and requests: employee responses to individual consumer needs and special requests (whether implicit or explicit) * Unprompted and unsolicited employee actions: events and employee behaviours, both good and bad, that are totally unexpected by the customer. * Failures relating to problematic customers: instances where neither the staff nor the service organisation is at fault for the service failure Perceived justice When consumers who have suffered as a result of service failures, seek redress, they are seeking some type of perceived justice defined as the process in which \\"consumers weigh their inputs against their outputs when forming recovery evaluations.\\" Perceived justice consists of three components: distributive justice, procedural justice and interactional justice:Hocutt, M.A, Chakraborty, G. and Mowen, J.C.,\\"The Impact of Perceived Justice on Customer Satisfaction and Intention to Complain in a Service Recovery\\", in Advances in Consumer Research, Volume 24, Merrie Brucks and Deborah J. MacInnis (eds), Provo, UT, Association for Consumer Research, 1997, pp 457-463, URL:http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/8086/volumes/v24/NA-24 * Distributive justice: focuses on the specific outcome of the firm‚Äôs recovery effort. It is a form of equity in exchange. In other words, what specifically did the offending firm offer the customer in the form of compensation for the service failure, and did the compensation offset the costs/ inconvenience of the service failure? * Procedural justice: examines the process that is undertaken to arrive at the final outcome. Hence, even though a customer may be satisfied with the type of recovery strategy offered, recovery evaluation may be poor due to the time and effort spent trying to obtain recompense or recovery outcome. * Interactional justice: refers to the manner in which the service recovery process is implemented and how recovery outcomes are presented. All three types of justice should be taken into consideration when devising recovery remedies. Factors There are several factors behind the Service Recovery Paradox phenomenon:Bing Zhao, (2011). Service recovery paradox effect: Comparisons in two service industries. 2011 2nd International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Management Science and Electronic Commerce (AIMSEC). ;Customer dissatisfaction: Customer dissatisfaction plays an important role for a firm in improving service quality and gaining loyal customers. Customer dissatisfaction may have a bigger effect on service quality and customer loyalty than customer satisfaction. A firm should aim to minimise customer dissatisfaction. Therefore, good recovery of a certain service by a firm may lead a customer's dissatisfaction to return to at least the level before a service failure occurred and even turn into satisfaction. ;Customer perceived value: High perceived value is believed to lead to high satisfaction.Ye, Zhigui (2003), ‚ÄúTaking Voice of Customer into Firms- Comparison of Customer Satisfaction and Value,‚Äù Journal of Beijing Technology and Business University (Social Science), Vol.18 No.6 (Nov), 36-40. In case of a service failure, a firm's goal should be to provide service recovery, to increase perceived value by customers and decrease dissatisfaction. Depending on the quality of the service recovery, a customer's perceived value may be higher than his/her pre-failure perceived value. ;Customer trust: A customer's trust in a firm leads to that individual thinking that the firm will provide quality service, which results in the firm gaining a loyal customer.Garbarino, E. and Johnson, M. (1999). The Different Roles of Satisfaction, Trust, and Commitment in Customer Relationships. Journal of Marketing, 63(2), p.70. Even in the case of service failures, which decrease customer trust, firms can provide recovery efforts to increase trust and re-gain loyalty. ;Customer switching Behavior: Customers may voice their complaints or switch their preferred firm in the case of a service failure. In both cases, the profitability of a firm is damaged. Good service recovery is important in terms of customer retention and can lead to stronger loyalty for customers, thus further increasing customer retention exceeding the pre-failure level. Empirical Evidence Empirical studies examining the Service Recovery Paradox have yielded mixed results. Some studies support the existence of SRP while other studies have contradictory findings. One study concludes that although Service Recovery Paradox exists, and its effects are significant, it is a very rare occurrence and it should not have any managerial relevance.Michel, S. and Meuter, M. (2008). The service recovery paradox: true but overrated?. Int J of Service Industry Mgmt, 19(4), pp.441-457. Another empirical study which examined the repurchasing behaviors of the customers of a telecommunication company, discovered that the number of customers who repurchased after a good service recovery were significantly higher than those who did not.Reis Soares, R., Proena, J. and Kannan, P. (2014). The Service Recovery Paradox in a Call-Center Context: Compensation and Timeliness in Recovering Mobile Customers. 2014 47th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences. However, Michel and Coughlan Michel, S., & Coughlan, S. (2009). THE SERVICE RECOVERY PARADOX: DISPELLING THE MYTH. Perspectives for Managers, (174), 1-4. in their 2009 study, using data from Swiss bank customers, concluded that service recovery paradox may only occur in case of mediocre service but not excellent service. Another conclusion was that the effect was most likely to occur when a number of conditions were met, such as the customer considering the failure not to be serious and to be out of the firm‚Äôs control.Magnini, V., Ford, J., Markowski, E. and Honeycutt, E. (2007). The service recovery paradox: justifiable theory or smoldering myth?. Journal of Services Marketing, 21(3), pp.213-225. A meta-analysis by de Matos, Henrique and Rossi de Matos, C., Henrique, J. and Alberto Vargas Rossi, C. (2007). Service Recovery Paradox: A Meta-Analysis. Journal of Service Research, 10(1), pp.60-77. aimed to get a better understanding of the SRP phenomenon to help further research by: # Estimating its combined effect for the key variables such as repurchase intentions and satisfaction. # Testing how studies might influence these results. # Suggesting further research directions.

It is the last active Shaker community, with three members as of 2017. The community was established in either 1782, 1783 or 1793, at the height of the Shaker movement in the United States. The Sabbathday Lake meetinghouse was built in 1794. The entire property was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1974. and The Shakers The Shakers were originally located in England in 1747, in the home of Mother Ann Lee. They developed from the religious group called the Quakers which originated in the 17th century. Both groups believed that everybody could find God within him or herself, rather than through clergy or rituals, but the Shakers tended to be more emotional and demonstrative in their worship. Shakers also believed that their lives should be dedicated to pursuing perfection and continuously confessing their sins and attempting a cessation of sinning. The Shakers migrated to Colonial America in 1774 in pursuit of religious freedom. They built 19 communal settlements that attracted some 20,000 converts over the next century. The first Shaker village was built in New Lebanon, New York, at the Mount Lebanon Shaker Society. The other 18 communities were built in Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, Kentucky, Ohio, Indiana, Georgia and Florida. Strict believers in celibacy, Shakers maintained their numbers through conversion and adoption of orphans. The group reached maximum size of about 6,000 full members in 1840. History of Sabbathday Lake Shakers The Shaker settlement at Sabbathday Lake was established by a group of Shaker missionaries in 1782, and was then known as Thompson's Pond Plantation. The first members were from Gorham, Maine. The community grew to over two hundred members in less than a year. Its location in Cumberland County, Maine, made it the most northern and eastern of all the Shaker communes. They raised their meetinghouse in April 1794 and built their first dwelling across the road in 1795.Stephen J. Paterwic, Historical Dictionary of the Shakers, 2d ed. (2017), 253. The Sabbathday Lake community grew to a size of with 26 large buildings by 1850. Buildings on the grounds included the meetinghouse, the Brethren's Shop which still holds a working blacksmith shop and woodworking operation. A large new Central Dwelling House was built in 1883 or 1884. The Shakers strived to be as self- sufficient as possible, while being an active part of the community. They built a mill and farm that enabled them to sell produce and commercial goods to the outside world. Membership By 1800, more than 140 believers lived at Sabbathday Lake community.Paterwic, Historical Dictionary of the Shakers, 2d ed. (2017), 253. By 1850, seventy Shakers lived in the Sabbathday Lake Church Family at New Gloucester.U.S. census, New Gloucester, Maine, 1850, family 75. The 1880 census listed 43 believers at Sabbathday Lake.U.S. 1880 census, New Gloucester, Maine, family 1. Membership hovered at about that point until the 1930s, when only about thirty members remained. Covenant In 1957, after \\"months of prayer,\\" Eldresses Gertrude, Emma, and Ida, the leaders of the United Society of Believers and members of Canterbury Shaker Village, voted to close the Shaker Covenant, the document which all new members need to sign to become members of the Shakers. In 1988, speaking about the three men and women in their 20s and 30s who had joined the Shakers and were living in the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, Eldress Bertha Lindsay said, \\"To become a Shaker you have to sign a legal document taking the necessary vows and that document, the official covenant, is locked up in our safe. Membership is closed forever.\\" However, a covenant is a contract with reciprocal obligations. Once executed between a number of parties, a covenant cannot be dissolved unless all parties agree‚Äîand the eldresses did not have the agreement of all remaining covenanted members. The Sabbathday Lake Shakers reopened their worship services to the public in 1963.Paterwic 255. The central dwelling house In the twenty-first century Membership to the community is still open, and occasionally \\"novices\\" explore joining the society. As of 2006, the Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village has 14 working buildings, including the Central Dwelling House, which includes a music room, chapel, kitchen and large dining room. The community still holds regular Public Meetings (worship services) on Sundays in the 1794 meetinghouse. Another building with historical significance is the Shaker Library, which houses a rich collection of Shaker records for historical research. Other historic buildings include the Cart and Carriage Shed, Ox Barn, The Girl's Shop, Herb House, Brooder House, Wood House, a garage built in 1910 for the group's first car, stable, Summer House and the Laundry building. The village, which attracts up to 10,000 visitors a year, has been open to the public since 1931, when the Shaker Museum and Library was established. Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village Aurelia Gay Mace, leader of Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village and author of The Aletheia: Spirit of Truth, a Series of Letters in Which the Principles of the United Society Known as Shakers are Set Forth and Illustrated, 1899, and The Mission and Testimony of the Shakers of the Twentieth Century to the World, 1904. This Museum is the largest repository of Maine Shaker culture. Examples of furniture, oval boxes, woodenware, metal and tin wares, technology and tools, \\"fancy\\" sales goods, costume and textiles, visual arts, and herbal and medicinal products are among the 13,000 artifacts currently part of the Sabbathday Lake collection. Although the collection represents every Shaker Community known to have existed, special emphasis has been placed upon preserving the heritage of the Maine Shaker Communities, including Sabbathday Lake, Poland Hill, Gorham, and Alfred. Present and future Barns at Sabbathday Lake Village As Shakers are celibate, new members cannot be born into the group and must join from the outside. Many prospective members find the celibacy a major drawback and it keeps them from joining. Current members have taken steps to ensure that Sabbathday Lake Village will remain largely unchanged when the final members of the group die. The of land owned by the Shakers in both Cumberland County and Androscoggin County include Sabbathday Lake which is with of undeveloped shoreline with a beach that is open to the public and the Shaker Bog. Other dismantled Shaker villages were converted into housing lots or prisons. In order to avoid this fate at Sabbathday Lake the Shakers took some preventive measures in 2001. Preservation and conservation easements were sold to Maine Preservation and the New England Forestry Foundation. The two groups with the help of eight other public and non-profit agencies are working to cover cost of the easements. The village and surrounding farmland and forests will be protected from development. Brother Arnold Hadd was quoted by the Boston Globe in 2006. \\"We can't put up a Wal-Mart. Or a housing development. The land always has to remain for agricultural and forest purposes.\\" The selling of future development rights has enabled the Shakers to restore and maintain the structures of the village. They also make money by leasing 29 cottage lots on Sabbathday Lake, leasing of forests, of farmland and orchards and a gravel pit. Other income sources include production of fancy goods, basket making, weaving, printing, and the manufacturing of some small woodenware. Their operation is run with the help of six year-round employees and six seasonal employees. Attending Shaker meeting, at Sabbathday Lake, 1886. On January 2, 2017, the community said that female community member, Sister Frances Carr had died that day. With Carr's death, Sister June Carpenter and Brother Arnold Hadd remained. The Spring/Summer 2019 issue of The Clarion, the Shakers' newsletter, makes reference to an additional Shaker in the community, Brother Andrew. Community life This community was one of the smaller Shaker groups during the sect's heyday. They farm and practice a variety of handicrafts; a Shaker Museum and Sunday services are open to visitors. Mother Ann Lee is celebrated on the first Sunday of August to commemorate the arrival of the English Shakers in America in 1774. The congregation sings and a Mother Ann cake is presented. The daily schedule of a Shaker in Sabbathday Lake Village is as follows: *The day begins at 7:30 am; the Great Bell on Dwelling House rings, calling everyone to breakfast. *At 8:00 am morning prayers start. Two Psalms are read, then passages are read from elsewhere in the Bible. Following this is communal prayer and silent prayer, concluded with the singing of a Shaker hymn. *Work for the Shakers begins at 8:30. *Work stops at 11:30 for midday prayers. *Lunch begins at 12:00. This is the main meal for the Shakers. *Work continues at 1:00 pm *At 6:00 it is dinner time, the last meal of the day. *On Wednesdays at 5:00 pm they hold a prayer meeting which is followed by a Shaker Studies class.About Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village United Society of Shakers, Retrieved January 18, 2011. Shaker Trust To preserve their legacy as well as their idyllic lakeside property at Sabbathday Lake Shaker Village, the Shakers announced in October 2005 that they had entered into a trust with the state of Maine and several conservation groups. Under the agreement, the Shakers will sell conservation easements to the trust, allowing the village to ward off development and continue operating as long as there are Shakers to live there. The agreement does not specify whether the property will become a park, museum, or other public space should the Shakers die out. That decision would be made by a nonprofit corporation‚Äîthe United Society of Shakers, Sabbathday Lake Inc.‚Äîwhose board members are largely non-Shakers.

It is famous for being a favourite place of Queen Elisabeth of Hungary.  History  = Origins = The palace is one of the most important, largest monuments of Hungarian palace architecture. Its builder, Count Antal Grassalkovich I (1694‚Äì1771) was a typical figure of the regrouping Hungarian aristocracy of the 18th century. He was a Royal Septemvir, president of the Hungarian Chamber, and confidant of Empress Maria Theresa (1740‚Äì1780). The construction began around 1733, under the direction of Andr√°s Mayerhoffer (1690‚Äì1771) a famous builder from Salzburg who worked in Baroque and Zopf style. The palace has a double U shape, and is surrounded by an enormous park. The building underwent several enlargements and modifications during the 18th century; its present shape being established in the time of the third generation of the Grassalkovich family. By then the building had 8 wings, and - besides the residential part - it contained a church, a theatre, a riding-hall, a hothouse, a greenhouse for flowers and an orangery. King Franz Joseph and Queen Elisabeth with the royal family at G√∂d√∂ll≈ë After the male side of the Grassalkovich family died out in 1841, the palace had several owners, and in 1867 it was bought for the crown. The decision of parliament designated it the resting residence of the King of Hungary. This state lasted until 1918, thus Francis Joseph (1867‚Äì1916) and later Charles IV and the royal family spent several months in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë every year. Garden of the palace During this period the palace became the symbol of independent Hungarian statehood, and, as a residential centre it had a political significance of its own. It was Queen Elisabeth (1837‚Äì1898) who specially loved staying in G√∂d√∂ll≈ë, where the Hungarian personnel and neighbourhood of the palace always warmly welcomed her. She was able to converse fluently in Hungarian. Following her tragic death, a memorial park adjoining the upper-garden was built. The period of the royal decades also brought their enlargements and modifications. The suites were made more comfortable, and a marble stable and coach house were built. The riding hall was remodelled. Between the two world wars the palace served as the residence for Regent Mikl√≥s Horthy. No significant building took place during this period, apart from an air-raid shelter in the southern front garden. After 1945 the palace, like many other buildings in Hungary, fell into decay. Soviet and Hungarian troops used the building, some of the beautifully decorated rooms were used for an old people's home, and the park was divided into smaller plots of land. =The beginning of rehabilitation and preservation= Royal Pavilion The protection of the palace as a historical monument started in 1981, when the National Board for Monuments launched its palace project. The most important tasks of preservation began in 1986 and were completed in the end of 1991. During this time the palace was partly emptied. By 1990 the Soviet troops left the southern wing, then the old people's home was closed down. During this time the roof of the riding-hall and the stable-wing was reconstructed, the fa√ßade of the building was renovated, as well as the trussing of the central wings and the double cupola. Research was carried out in the archives and in the building, and thus the different building periods of the monument were defined. Painted walls and rooms were uncovered which revealed the splendour of the 18-19th centuries. Architectural structures were discovered, and so were the different structures of the park. = Reconstructed quarters= The utilisation of the main front wings of the palace was designed as a clear and well-developed architectural project. The first floor's 23 rooms (nearly 1000 sq. m.) accommodate the interior exhibition. The emphasis was laid on the revival of the atmosphere of the royal period and the introduction of the time of the Grassalkovich family. Reconstruction is the principle of the interiors completed so far creating the state as it was around the 1880s. One of the most striking features of the Empress Elisabeth Exhibition is its historical accuracy. The painted foyer and the Grand Hall on the first floor are also used for various programmes, with a link to the programme organisation and gastronomic activity unit on the ground floor. Right before the double drive there is a car park for the visitors, suitable for 60 cars and 5 buses at a time. The visitor service units and the connected infrastructure are situated on the ground floor: cloak-room, ticket office, tourist information centre, toilets (also for the disabled), payphone, etc. Various retail units are found on the northern side: a souvenir centre, photo studio, while on the southern side there is a coffee shop and several function rooms. The northern front garden, at the main fa√ßade with its so- called Italian bastions and walkways was reconstructed with historical authenticity in 1998. The cheerful inner court is a resting place, where various outdoor programmes are held. The 26-hectare English park, which is open to the public every year, was declared a nature reserve in 1998. Its botanical curiosities are much appreciated by the visitors. Riding competitions are held in the park annually.

The company was headquartered in San Jose, California, in the Silicon Valley. The company had employed approximately 1,600 employees globally, including 550 in R&D;, sales and administration, 450 in customer care and 600 agency employees in five U.S. offices and an additional nine offices around the world by July 2010. The 2Wire HomePortal residential gateways were distributed by broadband service providers such as AT&T;, Embarq, windstream and Qwest in the United States, Bell in Canada, Telmex in Mexico, BT Group in the United Kingdom, Telstra in Australia and SingTel in Singapore. In July 2010, Pace plc of the United Kingdom agreed to buy 2Wire for $475m (¬£307m).  History  2Wire was founded in 1998 by Brian Hinman (who also founded PictureTel and Polycom), Pasquale Romano, Brad Kayton, Timothy Peers, and Tom Spalding. In January 2000, 2Wire delivered its first product, the HomePortal residential gateway, at that year's Consumer Electronics Show (CES). This broadband modem/router combination enabled DSL connectivity with home networking, firewall protection, and remote management capabilities. The following year, in January 2001, 2Wire delivered a wireless residential gateway. In 2002, the company created a remote customer premises management platform called CMS. Later that year, 2Wire published the Open Gateway Management Protocol (OGMP). The OGMP formed the basis for the TR-069 WAN management protocol subsequently ratified by the DSL Forum in 2004. In early 2003, 2Wire delivered a wireless gateway with a complete system-on-a-chip architecture. Also in 2003, the company acquired Sugar Media, a digital media provider. The following year, in the spring of 2004, 2Wire launched MediaPortal, a multi-service media platform that integrates DSL and satellite services. The MediaPortal-powered set-top box, combining television, digital video recorder, video, music, photo viewings, and messaging capabilities, was deployed by AT&T; in 2006 as part of its Homezone service. In January 2006, 2Wire introduced the HomePortal intelligent Network Interface Device (iNID), an outdoor broadband residential gateway that supports VDSL2 and fiber to the premises (FTTP) connections. 2Wire acquired Kenati Technologies, an embedded device software company, in October 2007. , 2Wire had shipped more than 20 million residential gateways to its telecommunications provider customers. In November 2008, 2Wire and Blockbuster Inc. developed and released MediaPoint Digital Media Player, a set-top box that plays video content from a home computer network.  Products  2Wire produces a series of residential gateways under the HomePortal name that enable home networking with interfaces that range from ADSL 2+ to fiber to the node (FTTN) (VDSL 1 and 2), as well as FTTP. The gateways are based on integrated system-on-a-chip architectures, and have native TR-069 support, as well as support for HomePNA, MoCA, USB, 802.11b/g/n wireless standards, and Web-based remote access. The company also produces MediaPortal (not to be confused with the unrelated open-source software MediaPortal), a multi-service media platform that combines high-definition (HD) and standard-definition (SD) broadcast satellite or off-air TV programming with broadband services, DVR capabilities, music and photo storage and sharing, and home networking. One of their gateways, the 2701, had issues with the power supply, prompting Bell Canada to proactively swap the power supplies to their customers in 2008. Some laptops with two types of Intel wireless adaptors exhibited wireless issues, which were fixed by an updated Intel device driver.http://internet.bell.ca/index.cfm?method=content.view&category;_id=615&content;_id=12135 The Pace 5012NV-002 Gateways were only available in Singapore for SingTel exStream Fiber Service and 2wire 2701 Series.

More specifically, it quantifies how much the amino acid distribution at some position i changes upon a perturbation of the amino acid distribution at another position j. The resulting statistical coupling energy indicates the degree of evolutionary dependence between the residues, with higher coupling energy corresponding to increased dependence. Definition of statistical coupling energy Statistical coupling energy measures how a perturbation of amino acid distribution at one site in an MSA affects the amino acid distribution at another site. For example, consider a multiple sequence alignment with sites (or columns) a through z, where each site has some distribution of amino acids. At position i, 60% of the sequences have a valine and the remaining 40% of sequences have a leucine, at position j the distribution is 40% isoleucine, 40% histidine and 20% methionine, k has an average distribution (the 20 amino acids are present at roughly the same frequencies seen in all proteins), and l has 80% histidine, 20% valine. Since positions i, j and l have an amino acid distribution different from the mean distribution observed in all proteins, they are said to have some degree of conservation. In statistical coupling analysis, the conservation (ŒîGstat) at each site (i) is defined as: \\\\Delta G_i^{stat} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_x (\\\\ln P_i^x)^2}. Here, Pix describes the probability of finding amino acid x at position i, and is defined by a function in binomial form as follows: P_i^x = \\\\frac{N!}{n_x!(N - n_x)!}p_x^{n_x}(1 - p_x)^{N - n_x}, where N is 100, nx is the percentage of sequences with residue x (e.g. methionine) at position i, and px corresponds to the approximate distribution of amino acid x in all positions among all sequenced proteins. The summation runs over all 20 amino acids. After ŒîGistat is computed, the conservation for position i in a subalignment produced after a perturbation of amino acid distribution at j (ŒîGi  Œ¥jstat) is taken. Statistical coupling energy, denoted ŒîŒîGi, jstat, is simply the difference between these two values. That is: \\\\Delta\\\\Delta G_{i, j}^{stat} = \\\\Delta G_{i  \\\\delta j}^{stat} - \\\\Delta G_i^{stat}, or, more commonly, \\\\Delta\\\\Delta G_{i, j}^{stat} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\sum_x (\\\\ln P_{i\\\\delta j}^x - \\\\ln P_i^x)^2} Statistical coupling energy is often systematically calculated between a fixed, perturbated position, and all other positions in an MSA. Continuing with the example MSA from the beginning of the section, consider a perturbation at position j where the amino distribution changes from 40% I, 40% H, 20% M to 100% I. If, in a subsequent subalignment, this changes the distribution at i from 60% V, 40% L to 90% V, 10% L, but does not change the distribution at position l, then there would be some amount of statistical coupling energy between i and j but none between l and j. Applications Ranganathan and Lockless originally developed SCA to examine thermodynamic (energetic) coupling of residue pairs in proteins. Using the PDZ domain family, they were able to identify a small network of residues that were energetically coupled to a binding site residue. The network consisted of both residues spatially close to the binding site in the tertiary fold, called contact pairs, and more distant residues that participate in longer-range energetic interactions. Later applications of SCA by the Ranganathan group on the GPCR, serine protease and hemoglobin families also showed energetic coupling in sparse networks of residues that cooperate in allosteric communication. Statistical coupling analysis has also been used as a basis for computational protein design. In 2005, Socolich et al. used an SCA for the WW domain to create artificial proteins with similar thermodynamic stability and structure to natural WW domains. The fact that 12 out of the 43 designed proteins with the same SCA profile as natural WW domains properly folded provided strong evidence that little information‚Äîonly coupling information‚Äîwas required for specifying the protein fold. This support for the SCA hypothesis was made more compelling considering that a) the successfully folded proteins had only 36% average sequence identity to natural WW folds, and b) none of the artificial proteins designed without coupling information folded properly. An accompanying study showed that the artificial WW domains were functionally similar to natural WW domains in ligand binding affinity and specificity. In de novo protein structure prediction, it has been shown that, when combined with a simple residue-residue distance metric, SCA-based scoring can fairly accurately distinguish native from non-native protein folds.

Hodder & Stoughton) Airs Above the Ground is a novel by Mary Stewart, first published in 1965. The title derives from Classical dressage, in particular, the graceful Airs Above the Ground, the haute ecole movements for which special breeds of horses, in particular Lippizans, are highly trained. These trained moves were once used by the horse to aid mounted soldiers in battle. Plot introduction Mary Stewart is known for raising the genre of romantic suspense novels to a higher and more educated level with a new kind (for the time) of intelligent heroine. Airs Above the Ground is a romantic murder mystery which takes place in Austria. Central to the story is a horse from the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, which the author wrote with the permission of the Director, Colonel Alois Podhajsky, for not only the use of the school, but of himself in the story. The story evokes the vivid and accurate sense of location, for which the author is well-known and beloved. The author, in an interview years later, tells of hearing the story of a horse who was tethered in a field, and the horse, upon hearing a song on a nearby car radio, started all on its own to do a dance it must have been trained for. This haunting story was the seed around which this novel was built. Plot summary Vanessa March is married to Lewis, who works for the Sales Department of Pan-European Chemicals. Having tea with her mother's schoolfriend Carmel Lacy at Harrods, she learns that Lewis, whom she believes to be in Stockholm on business, appears in a newsreel story about a circus fire in Austria. Carmel, assuming Vanessa will be joining Lewis in Austria, asks her to accompany her seventeen-year-old son Timothy, who wants to visit his divorced father in Vienna. Seeing the newsreel for herself, Vanessa sees Lewis in Austria ‚Äî with his arm around a blonde girl. When she receives a message from Lewis postmarked Stockholm, Vanessa immediately agrees to travel to Austria, unaware that by doing so she is endangering her husband and herself. The story is set against a backdrop of circus life, stolen goods, international smuggling, and an old mystery involving the disappearance of a famed Lipizzaner stallion and his groom.

The building opened to the public on June 22, 2009. History A new archives building was originally planned in 1960, as an 11-story home for the offices and libraries of the Church Historian and Recorder and the Genealogical Society of Utah. The need for such large facilities diminished due to advances in modern document preservation, as well as with the 1963 completion of the Granite Mountain Records Vault, which had vast storage for genealogical materials. Following the completion of the Church Office Building in 1972, the Church's Historical Department resided in the four floors of the east wing. In April 2005, plans were announced to construct a new Church History Library to be completed in late 2007. The site was then a Temple Square parking lot, and was the same site as in the 1960 plan, northeast of the intersection of Main and North Temple. This new facility houses the Church History Department (the modern name of the Church Historian's Office) and the church's historical archives. The building was dedicated on June 20, 2009 and opened to the public on June 22 with extended hours, improved technology, assistance staff and additional educational and training programs. Collections The Church History Library preserves materials related to the history of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from the 1820s in upstate New York, to the current day, with more than 14 million members around the world. The historical materials of the LDS Church contain rich information about both Mormon history and the development of the western United States. These collections include: * 270,000 books, pamphlets, magazines, manuals * 500,000 historic photographs, posters, maps * 23,000 audio and video recordings * 120,000 local histories for LDS Church units * 150,000 journals, diaries, papers, and manuscripts * 20,000 rolls of microfilm * 3.5 million patriarchal blessings for LDS Church members Facilities The new building provides temperature, humidity, and air quality control for the Church's historical collections. Materials are stored in two types of archival storage rooms. The 10 main storage rooms are kept at with 35 percent relative humidity. There are also two special rooms that will be kept at minus four degrees Fahrenheit for color motion picture films, photographs, and records of special significance. The building has areas for conservation, collections development, and research. The Church's conservation efforts involve 300 to 500 books and documents and 3,000 to 4,000 audiovisual recordings every year. Collections development staff acquire and catalog 500 to 700 new collections annually, including 6,000 publications. Other staff members housed in the new building will be responsible for publications, historic sites, and web content. In 2005, the Church History Library applied to be certified through the Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) rating system, the national standard for the design, construction, and operation of environmentally friendly buildings. After construction, the project will be eligible for certification. Public services All research facilities opened to the public on June 22.

They served in the Southwest Pacific Theater during World War II. Formed as a top secret ad hoc unit by the lieutenant general commanding Sixth Army, Walter Krueger, on 28 November 1943 to conduct raider and reconnaissance work in the Southwest Pacific, the Alamo Scouts performed 108 missions behind enemy lines without losing a single man killed or captured. Of the more than 700 candidates selected for training, only 138 were retained as Alamo Scouts and were formed into elite six-to-seven man teams. Throughout the war the Alamo Scouts conducted the doctrinal missions of Special Reconnaissance, Direct Action, Foreign Internal Defense, and Unconventional Warfare. In less than seventeen months in the field the Alamo Scouts earned 118 combat decorations and numerous other awards. The unit was unceremoniously disbanded in late November 1945 with a war record unmatched in United States military history. In 1988 the Alamo Scouts were awarded the Special Forces Tab recognizing the unit as a forerunner of the modern Special Forces. First Director of Training was Frederick W. Bradshaw, followed by Homer A. Williams, then by Gibson Niles. There were nine training classes that lasted for six weeks each. Their locations were; two at Kalo Kalo, Fergusson Island, New Guinea. one at Mange Point, Finschafen Area, New Guinea, two at Cape Kassoe, Hollandia, Dutch New Guinea, one at the mouth of Cadacan River, on the Philippine island of Leyte, and three at Mabayo (Subic Bay) on the Philippine island of Luzon.

He was the leader of the Alikozai Pashtun tribe. Mujahideen commander Mullah Naqib gained respect as a military leader during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, when he fought against Soviet and Afghan communist forces. In 1984, he became affiliated with the Jamiat-e Islami party of Burhanuddin Rabbani. The Jamiat was often perceived as having a constituency limited to the Tajik community, so Rabbani was especially careful to cultivate his relations with the few Pashtun commanders willing to join him, such as Mullah Naqib. Naqib's forces built a fortified base in the Arghandab district, that the government troops repeatedly, and unsuccessfully tried to destroy. In June 1987, a large force of government troops, spearheaded by tanks and supported by Soviet artillery attacked into Arghandab. After a week of hard fighting in the \\"green zone\\", the dense agricultural area along the Arghandab valley, the force approached the main mujahideen at Chaharqulba. Dismayed by their inability to stop the advancing armour, some mujahideen commanders suggested to Naqib that they should withdraw. A commander described the interview: > Finally, we Mujahideen commanders went to Naqib and said that we are > outnumbered and should leave the base. Naqib said that this is their last > battle and will decide the contest between them and us.[...] We replied that > the RPGs were not working against the sandbagged tanks. Naqib took an RPG > and strode out to the forward positions to kill a tank. We commanders > stopped him and promised to fight to the end. Eventually, the government troops withdrew, having suffered heavy casualties.Urban, p.125 Mullah Naqib is also said to have personally shot down three Mi-24 gunships using Stinger missiles supplied by the CIA. His military record gave him a heroic status among the local population. Mullah Naqib by his own admission executed at least thirty suspected traitors or captured enemy soldiers. Later career After the collapse of the communist regime in 1992, the mujahideen took control of Kandahar. Gul Agha Sherzai was nominally the governor but he lacked authority, as each group sought to carve itself a territory to control. Mullah Naqib was the most powerful commander in the city, and many of his subordinates turned to illegal taxation and theft, in order to earn an income. The situation remained calm until 1993, when sporadic clashes erupted between different factions. The lawlessness in Kandahar paved the way for the rise of the Taliban movement. On November 3, 1994, Mullah Naqib and his 2,500 men did not resist the advance of the Taliban, allowing them to capture the city, and, in exchange, he was permitted to retire safely into his bastion in Arghandab. This led to widespread suspicions that he had been bribed, but there is also evidence that he was acting under orders from Rabbani, the President in Kabul.Maley, p.208 Role in post-Taliban Afghanistan Mullah Naqib reemerged as the Taliban regime began to dissolve following the 2001 US invasion of Afghanistan. He managed to broker a deal between Hamid Karzai and Taliban leader Mullah Omar, allowing the surrender of 3,000 militants in Kandahar. However, his rivalry with Gul Agha Sherzai also resurfaced, and their forces clashed, as Sherzai's men seized several key positions, with the support of US airstrikes. Karzai later defused the situation, by brokering a power shareout agreement, whereby Sherzai was made governor, and the post of vice-governor was attributed to Naqib, who gave it to his brother-in-law. Americans and their Afghan allies suspected Naquib of helping Mullah Omar escape Kandahar before they arrived. Even though Omar had handed over Kandahar over to Naquib, the night before Omar was to surrender, him and other senior Taliban leaders disappeared. Naqib denies having any knowledge of how Omar escaped. After once again retiring to his tribal area in Arghandab, Mullah Naqib became a powerful asset for the government in its struggle against the Taliban. His tribal militia prevented them from gaining influence in the Arghandab district, that is considered critical to the defense of Kandahar. He thus became a prime objective for Taliban assassins, who targeted him with a bombing attack in early March 2007, leaving him badly injured. After receiving treatment for several months in India, Naqib returned to Afghanistan, to witness a deteriorating security situation. He warned of an impending Taliban attack, and advised against the planned withdrawal of Canadian ISAF troops form Kandahar province, scheduled for 2009. Naqib died of a heart attack on October 11, 2007. Thousands of people, including President Hamid Karzai, attended his funeral. His death was severe blow to the U.S-led coalition and to the Afghan government, that left the Arghandab district open to attack by the Taliban.

Until its closure in 2008, it was the only French Protestant church in Britain outside London, where the French Protestant Church of London, founded in 1550, occupies a building dating from 1893 in Soho Square. Brighton's dates from the previous decade, and is centrally located in Queensbury Mews, a small street just behind Brighton seafront and next to the Metropole Hotel. Opened in 1887, it was put up for sale in June 2008 and was closed a month later. History In 1548, Deryck Carver, a French-speaking Flemish man from a town near Li√®ge, sought refuge in Brighton from the persecution he was experiencing from the ruling powers of the time in respect of his Calvinist beliefs. He had been a lay reader; as well as establishing Brighton's first brewery, the Black Lion, he held Bible reading sessions at his house in Brighton for the next few years until Roman Catholicism was re-established as Britain's state religion by Queen Mary I in 1553. At this time, such meetings of Protestants were banned, and Carver was arrested and committed to trial in London for continuing to hold them. He was burnt at the stake in 1555. Main entrance and rose window, on the south side. The meetings had been attended by many fishermen from both England and France, beginning the tradition of French Christian worship in Brighton. In the 17th and 18th centuries, this was maintained in a Presbyterian chapel in the centre of the town, which was attended by many Francophone worshippers. Calvinists, meanwhile, met secretly in private houses until an official church was formed for the Francophone population in 1858. The first two pastors were French, as were many members of the committee formed later to assist the church council. However, a Brighton resident, Mrs E. Hayes, played a significant role in bringing the church community together. Services were initially held at her house, and later in various churches and public buildings in the town; but in 1887 the pastor oversaw the building of a dedicated church for the congregation. A plot of land behind Kings Road was bought for ¬£735, and building materials cost another ¬£800. Money was raised from the congregation itself, Protestant congregations in France and people within Brighton's religious community. Mrs Hayes coordinated the fundraising and donated some money herself. These efforts were criticised by Rev. J. Gregory in his sermon at the dedication ceremony on 18 July 1887; he described fundraising in general as \\"stirring the Lord's fire with the devil's poker\\", and complained about the activities that were organised, saying that they did not fit \\"with the Lord's work\\". A time capsule was set into the main foundation stone, containing items associated with Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. The stone was laid by the Mayor of Brighton using a specially made trowel, and the church was consecrated on 27 February 1888. The church was licensed for worship in accordance with the Places of Worship Registration Act 1855 and had the registration number 30558. Architecture Designed in red- brick Gothic style by the architect W. G. Gibbins, the church has three pairs of lancet windows in the western face, a pointed-arch entrance door and rose window in quatrefoil form in the southern face, a slate roof and a small copper spire on top of a square turret. The church today At the start of the 20th century, there were around 2,000 French speakers in Brighton, many of them Protestants, but the community is now much smaller. There was, however, a weekly service (in French and English) at 11.00am on Sundays. The building was offered for sale in June 2008, as its trustees decided they could no longer maintain it. Demolition is considered unlikely, however; the building may be converted for residential or commercial use, and the time capsule will be retained. Services were held at the church until it was sold; the last service was on 26 July 2008. The congregation was reported to be planning to find alternative accommodation in the city.

Ingle also played cricket for Cambridge University, but failed to win a blue. He was born at Bodmin, Cornwall and died at Bath, Somerset. A right-handed middle-order batsman, Ingle was a regular player for 10 years in the Somerset side from 1927 to 1937, an era in which the team's batting was dominated by amateur cricketers. A member of a legal family from Bath, Ingle himself practised as a solicitor in the city and for much of the 1930s, the Somerset side had three Bath solicitors in its ranks, with Bunty Longrigg, Ingle's successor as captain, appearing alongside Dickie Burrough. Early life and cricket career Ingle went to Oundle School, heading the school batting averages in 1921. He made his first-class debut for Somerset in a rain-ruined match against Essex at Taunton in August 1923. He made 54 in his first innings, one of only two Somerset players to make more than seven in a total of 189, and put on 97 for the sixth wicket with Jack MacBryan, who made 101. Ingle was at Cambridge University for the 1923 to 1926 seasons, but made little impact on cricket there. He did not play at all in 1923, was tried five times in 1924 and then fleetingly again in both 1925 and 1926, but in 15 innings for Cambridge he made only 138 runs, and was not picked for the University matches against Oxford. In each season, though, once the university term was over he returned to play fairly regularly for Somerset. Ingle's development as a batsman was slow and his batting average hovered around the mid teens for the whole of the mid 1920s. In 1926, he made his first century, an unbeaten 119 against Essex at Taunton in which he shared four 50-run partnerships over the course of four hours. But without that century, his batting average for the season, including a couple of games for Cambridge, would have been less than 12. The innings remained the highest of his career, although he hit nine other first-class centuries. County regular From 1927, Ingle played regularly for Somerset for 11 seasons, never appearing in less than 21 games a year. He was allowed out of the family firm legal duties by his father, returning to the law for the winters. The first full season was mediocre, but in the first match of the 1928 season, against Middlesex at Taunton, he hit 117 and 100 not out, only the third player, after Peter Randall Johnson and John Daniell, to achieve the feat for Somerset. The rest of the season did not live up to this start, but Ingle still finished the season by passing 1,000 runs for the first time and having an average for his 1,027 runs of 27.75, the first time he had passed 20 for a complete season. The following three seasons saw no progression. Ingle's batting averages reverted to below 20 in each of them, and he did not approach 1,000 runs for the season. There was just one more century in these years: 108 against Cambridge University at Bath in 1929. Somerset captain At the end of the 1931 English cricket season, Jack White, Somerset captain since 1927, gave up the captaincy and Ingle was appointed for the 1932 season. He held the job for six seasons, and could be accounted relatively successful, since the side finished in the top half of the County Championship twice in this period, a feat not achieved in the preceding seven seasons. For Ingle personally, the first season of captaincy, 1932, was the best. Wisden, in its review of the 1932 Somerset season for the 1933 annual, said he was to be \\"heartily congratulated\\" on the improvement in the side which had taken it from thirteenth to seventh place. It went on: \\"If taking some time really to find his form, he led the side with considerable ability and judgment and set his colleagues a creditable example in the matter of fielding. He put together three separate innings of over a hundred, increased his average by seven and finished with an aggregate of nearly a thousand.\\" In fact, adding in his scores in one match for Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), Ingle passed 1,000 runs for the second time in his career, and his season total of 1,083 runs at an average of 24.06 was his best in aggregate. In fact, the following season, 1933, Ingle fared even better with the bat, though he missed out on 1,000 for the season by missing half a dozen games. His average of 29.74 for 922 runs in the season was his highest, and he scored two centuries. The team as a whole, however, fell from seventh to eleventh in the Championship. Ingle's batting fell away rather badly after this high point. In the next three seasons, he struggled to average 15 runs an innings, though he made one further century in 1935. Wisden noted that Ingle had become \\"a member of a rather pronounced 'tail'.\\" Somerset returned to seventh place in the County Championship in 1936, but again it proved to be a temporary success. After the 1937 season, in which the county returned to the lower reaches of the championship table, Ingle stood down as captain, being replaced by his fellow Bath solicitor, Longrigg. He played a few matches for the county in both 1938 and 1939, but did not reappear in first-class cricket after the Second World War. Personal style Ingle was a well-liked captain, according to David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, and unlike some Somerset amateurs got on well with the limited numbers of professionals the county employed. The life of a Somerset captain in the inter-war years was rarely easy, because the county rarely had more than half a dozen professionals, and the team was perennially made up of an itinerant band of amateurs of variable talent. In one of Ingle's more successful seasons, 1936, Somerset played 34 different cricketers in the County Championship matches. Ingle himself missed some games most seasons because of chronic hay fever which, according to Foot, he maintained was made worse by long train journeys: he told Foot that he would travel in the luggage rack to get some sleep and some respite from the dust. Ingle was famously the captain when Harold Gimblett arrived at Frome as an unknown for his legendary first-class debut. Players such as Arthur Wellard, Horace Hazell, Wally Luckes and Bill Andrews played as professionals for Somerset for many seasons and developed under Ingle. Ingle, wrote Foot, \\"had a gift for what today is rather glibly known as motivation\\". But he could also be a disciplinarian, suspending two of the professionals for a couple of matches for misbehaviour and warning an amateur off for providing the professionals with duff horse-racing tips. After cricket and outside cricket There is a suggestion in Ingle's obituary in the 1993 Wisden that the parting at the end of the 1937 season was less than amicable. \\"Ingle eventually resigned the captaincy, or was manoeuvred out of it, amid some bitterness,\\" it said. \\"He rarely returned to the ground thereafter.\\" Ingle also had a long and successful law career in which, according to Foot, he acquired a reputation for taking on and winning cases for the gipsy community. He was also the defence solicitor for the celebrated postwar case of Ann Cornock, a Bristol woman accused of murdering her husband George Cornock in his bath in December 1946, a charge of which she was acquitted: Ingle attributed the result partly to the prestige of Sir Bernard Spilsbury, who had advised the defence, led by J. D. Casswell KC. Ingle told Foot that it was the Cornock case that had turned his hair white, though Foot added in his book that the cares of the Somerset captaincy were probably a contributory factor.

It is the only high school in the Gateway Regional School District, serving students from Blandford, Chester, Huntington, Middlefield, Montgomery, and Russell. History It is said that before the abolition of slavery, a branch of the Underground Railroad, which was developed to assist fugitive slaves in their escape to Canada, ran through Huntington (then Murrayfield). Millers' Tavern operated as a \\"station,\\" and, being the last \\"hiding place\\" en route, became known as \\"The Gateway.\\" Today, the High School, Junior High School, Middle School, and Littleville Elementary stand on the old Moore farm property, the house and barns of which once served as Millers' Tavern and Stage Coach Inn.

In 1852 he ran in 51:42, his personal best time and a longtime world record.Illustrated Sporting and Dramatic News, 7 June 1862. Levett was born in 1826, the eldest son of carpenter John Levett and his wife Sarah (n√©e Yates). The family lived at York Street, later New Road, Battersea. John Levett Jr. married Sarah Hannah Coulson, and the couple had five children between 1847 and 1856. Hannah and the children lived at York Street with her Levett in-laws, apparently because her husband was often away training or competing. Money was obviously tight, and Levett's running schedule seems to have left little time for much else. For his training, John Levett ran at Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, and competed in a succession of races. In 1851 he ran in Hyde Park, Sheffield, earning ¬£50.The Era, 1851. On 11 October 1852, running at Islington for the title of Champion Runner of England, Levett ran in under 52 minutes and won the title for the second time.The Era, October 1852. In August 1854 Levett ran at Birkenhead, near Liverpool, this time winning ¬£100.The Era, August 1854. At the competition, two gentlemen from Preston were looking for a man to run in one hour on one day and in two hours the following day. Each man had bet ¬£100 for each match. Levett stayed at the Liverpool Arms, Duke Street, and trained at Hoylake and Aintree racecourses. The Star Hotel, Birkenhead was the headquarters. Levett ran in 2 minutes under an hour at Rock Ferry on the Monday evening. On Tuesday he was clearly suffering from his previous efforts and gave up after running an hour and 29 minutes, completing 15 and a half miles. The race took its toll; Levett was suffering from exhaustion. Nevertheless, he then took ¬£100 and ¬£50 to run in 2 hours and was tied to do in the first hour, set for the following Monday in Liverpool. The financial rewards pushed Levett forward, but in those days the running was gruelling with men exerting themselves to the point where they frothed at the mouth. Another match was near the Zoological gardens, Liverpool. Levett's opponent was Richard Manks of Warwickshire. They ran starting at 28 minutes to five. Manks gave up after . Levett completed his 12th mile in exactly an hour and the fifteen miles (24 km) in one hour and 18 minutes. Levett then undertook to run in two hours on Monday next on the same ground. On Sunday 15 April 1855, another match was scheduled, pitting James (aka Jem) Pudney of Mile End against Levett at Mr Sadler's enclosed ground at Garratt Lane, Wandsworth.The Era, 16 April 1855. The day of the race dawned gray and rainy, but 2,000 spectators still showed up for the competition, in which Levett was favoured. At the outset of the race Levett appeared in fine physical condition, while Pudney looked to be suffering. Levett dominated the race nearly all the way, with Pudney making headway only one or twice. In the fifth mile Pudney gained more than 100 yards on his competitor, but soon gave signs of distress. Pudney continued running but eventually gave out of exhaustion and dropped out. Levett ran at a more leisurely pace and was an easy winner. At the time of the race, Pudney was the country's champion but his poor performance cost him his title, which he ceded to Levett. Just over a month later, on 20 May 1855 there was a rematch The Era, 22 May 1855. at Wandsworth between the two champions. Pudney gave Levett a 100-yard head start in the abbreviated six-mile (10 km) race. Levett began at a rapid clip, and for a while the two were neck and neck. After a while Levett took the lead. At the fourth mile, covered in 21 minutes, he led Pudney by three yards in a close race. By the fifth mile Levett was leading. But suddenly Pudney shot by his opponent and left Levett increasingly in the rear, winning by 40 yards. Both runners were exhausted and had to be carried off by their friends. Levett was crestfallen. Headlines in July 1855 newspapers announced: \\"Tomorrow the once-renowned 10-mile runner and Richard Manks, the 'Warwickshire Antelope', run at Hyde Park, Sheffield for ¬£50\\".The Era, 8 July 1855. Soon afterwards, there was a handicap race at Garratt Lane, Wandsworth, with William Jackson (\\"the American Deer\\"), Charles Cook (of Marylebone), Levett, and William Newman all competing. A runner named Frost was favored, with Levett in the back of the pack. Ultimately Levett won the race in 54 minutes 7 seconds. Later in 1855, Levett was accused with William Thompson of causing a nuisance in Grainger Street, Newcastle upon Tyne, outside the Grainger hotel.The Newcastle Courant, 26 October 1855. Thompson was accused of inciting others, cursing them, calling them thieves and prizefighters. Levett jumped in to the rescue just as the police arrived and was subsequently charged with disorderly conduct. He said \\"I may be a public man but I am always honest\\". The same year, Levett ran again at Hyde Park, Sheffield, against Manks, defeating him; it was the fastest race ever run there. 6 January 1856: Levett ran against Rowan of Gateshead in front of 2,000 people and was victorious when Rowan gave up, exhausted. On 13 August 1856: Levett was beaten by the Scottish champion Thomas Kerr, in Edinburgh. John Levett had actually based himself in Edinburgh from the spring of 1856 and continued his sporting career from there. He sent written articles to the American newspapers where his career had been followed keenly. In 1856 he wrote to the New York Clipper \\"As my friends and I consider that I have been ill-used by the present world champion, James Pudney, perhaps you will allow me, as an old, and when in my best day, not the slowest pedestrian, to say a few words for the last time, considering the championship. Before going into Scotland in the spring of the year, I challenged all the world for the championship, having first proved, that the celebrated clipper, John Levett, was once more, after so much hard training, coming to his old form. The invincible Pudney did not answer that challenge, yet still retained \\"champion\\" to his name. Some two months since, I again challenged the world. The gallant James agreed to sign and stake as soon as I made a deposit; but that also came to nothing, though my money was up. To give him one more chance I am still open to run any man breathing, 10 miles for ¬£50 odds, on 1 January 1857. If this is not accepted, I shall sign myself, in future, John Levett, Champion of the World.\\" In 1857 Levett was back at Garratt Lane, Wandsworth but a report The Era, 1857. noted that he was out of shape and Levett did indeed lose the match. Shortly afterwards, Levett became the proprietor of the Victoria running ground in Newcastle and he ran at Manchester. In Dublin, Ireland, on 17 October 1860 a local newspaper reported that Levett wished to walk in 1,000 hours, beginning at Mr Doyle's hotel in Sandymount. Running: A popular sport since ancient times By 1860 Levett was listed as manager of a running establishment in Dublin, holding grand competitions at La Rotunda and offering training and instruction classes in athletics. It was in Dublin that he challenged a \\"Red Indian\\" called Deerfoot,Dublin Courant, 1861. to a race. It was an exciting event which saw the Native American Deerfoot win with an Indian whoop. Deerfoot ran in exactly 52 minutes, watched by a large crowd of 6,000 spectators. Levett retired after completing five miles (8 km) in 26 minutes and 45 secs.The race between Deerfoot and Levett is described by author Edward S. Sears in his Running Through the Ages, Edward S. Sears, McFarland & Co., John Levett later taught swimming and patented a new type of swimming float. It was in Blackpool in August 1876 that John and a group of professional swimmers put on some entertainment at the end of the pier to show the advantage of using the floats, called bladders, to an attentive audience. Levett was first in the water, followed by three young women. It soon became apparent that the waves were far too high and they were in difficulties, the tide sucking them towards Fleetwood. The first girl in the water clung to Levett, who was wearing his float, whilst a man called Bibbero, plunged in to save another girl. The other young lady was also rescued. Nobody attempted to launch a boat for some time to rescue Levett and the girl who was still clinging to him for her life. Eventually, a boat was launched and reached the two, bringing them to the shore where they were taken to the Derby Hotel. The girl was able to walk away but despite fervent attempts, Levett would not revive. He was fifty years old. John had established a new life for himself in Edinburgh leaving his London family behind, therefore the death certificate for his wife, Sarah Hannah Levett, can be found among the records for the Isle of Thanet, where she moved to be near her son, Edwin, who became proprietor of the Metropolitan Infirmary (a therapeutic establishment for sickly and scrofulous children in Margate), and to her daughter Esther, who lived nearby and had married the previous proprietor of the infirmary, John Weekley.

View of Narew flowing through Puszcza Kurpiowska In the 16th century the Kurpiowska Forest was called Zagajnica, adding to its definition the counties of ≈Åom≈ºa, Ostro≈Çƒôka and Przasnysz, in which parts of the forest were located. In the 18th century the term Kurpiowska Forest was extended to include the Green Forest () and White Forest () which belonged to the Bishops of P≈Çock. Kurpiowska Forest gradually began to be identified with Puszcza Zielona. In the late 20th century, forested areas accounted for approximately 33% of the Kurpiowska Forest. Most (95%) of forest areas include pine, with sparse alder, spruce, oak and birch.

HspE7 is derived from Nventa‚Äôs patented CoVal fusion platform that uses recombinant DNA technology to covalently fuse heat shock proteins to target antigens, thereby stimulating cellular immune system responses to specific diseases. Nventa is developing HspE7 in combination with the Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist adjuvant Poly-ICLC for multiple indications, including Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia (also known as cervical dysplasia or CIN), genital warts, cervical cancer, and head and neck cancers. According to the annual information form, for the year ending December 31, 2009, provided on Akela Pharma's website, scientific research funding has ceased for HspE7.

In June 2008, Nventa announced the development of a proprietary vaccine adjuvant, Poly IC ‚Äì Poly Arginine (Poly-ICR), for use with both therapeutic and prophylactic vaccines. Poly-ICR is a TLR3 agonist that, when combined with a disease-specific antigen, can induce both cytotoxic (T cell) and antibody (B cell) immune responses against that antigen.

A CLO is a type of collateralized debt obligation. Leveraging Each class of owner may receive larger yields in exchange for being the first in line to risk losing money if the businesses fail to repay the loans that a CLO has purchased. The actual loans used are multimillion-dollar loans to either privately or publicly owned enterprises. Known as syndicated loans and originated by a lead bank with the intention of the majority of the loans being immediately \\"syndicated\\", or sold, to the collateralized loan obligation owners. The lead bank retains a minority amount of the loan while usually maintaining \\"agent\\" responsibilities representing the interests of the syndicate of CLOs as well as servicing the loan payments to the syndicate (though the lead bank can designate another bank to assume the agent bank role upon syndication closing). The loans are usually termed \\"high risk\\", \\"high yield\\", or \\"leveraged\\", that is, loans to companies which owe an above average amount of money for their size and kind of business, usually because a new business owner has borrowed funds against the business to purchase it (known as a \\"leveraged buyout\\"), because the business has borrowed funds to buy another business, or because the enterprise borrowed funds to pay a dividend to equity owners. Rationale The reason behind the creation of CLOs was to increase the supply of willing business lenders, so as to lower the price (interest costs) of loans to businesses and to allow banks more often to immediately sell loans to external investor/lenders so as to facilitate the lending of money to business clients and earn fees with little to no risk to themselves. CLOs accomplish this through a 'tranche' structure. Instead of a regular lending situation where a lender can earn a fixed interest rate but be at risk for a loss if the business does not repay the loan, CLOs combine multiple loans but do not transmit the loan payments equally to the CLO owners. Instead, the owners are divided into different classes, called \\"tranches\\", with each class entitled to more of the interest payments than the next, but with them being ahead in line in absorbing any losses amongst the loan group due to the failure of the businesses to repay. Normally a leveraged loan would have an interest rate set to float above the three-month LIBOR (London Inter-bank Offered Rate), but potentially only a certain lender would feel comfortable with the risk of loss associated with a single, financially leveraged borrower. By pooling multiple loans and dividing them into tranches, in effect multiple loans are created, with relatively safe ones being paid lower interest rates (designed to appeal to conservative investors), and higher risk ones appealing to higher risk investors (by offering a higher interest rate). The whole point is to lower the cost of money to businesses by increasing the supply of lenders (attracting both conservative and risk taking lenders). CLOs were created because the same \\"tranching\\" structure was invented and proven to work for home mortgages in the early 1980s. Very early on, pools of residential home mortgages were turned into different tranches of bonds to appeal to various forms of investors. Corporations with good credit ratings were already able to borrow cheaply with bonds, but those that could not had to borrow from banks at higher costs. The CLO created a means by which companies with weaker credit ratings could borrow from institutions other than banks, lowering the overall cost of money to them. Demand As a result of the subprime mortgage crisis, the demand for lending money either in the form of mortgage bonds or CLOs almost ground to a halt, with negligible issuance in 2008 and 2009. The market for U.S. collateralized loan obligations was truly reborn in 2012, however, hitting $55.2 billion, with new-issue CLO volume quadrupling from the previous year, according to data from Royal Bank of Scotland analysts. Big names such as Barclays, RBS and Nomura launched their first deals since before the credit crisis; and smaller names such as Onex, Valcour, Kramer Van Kirk, and Och Ziff ventured for the first ever time into the CLO market, reflecting the rebounding of market confidence in CLOs as an investment vehicle.http://www.creditflux.com/Newsletter/2012-08-02/Citi-leads- charge-as-CLO-volumes-surge-past-last-yearrsquos-tally/ CLO issuance has soared since then, culminating in full-year 2013 CLO issuance in the U.S. of $81.9 billion, the most since the pre-Lehman era of 2006-2007, as a combination of rising interest rates and below-trend default rates drew significant amounts of capital to the leveraged loan asset class. The US CLO market picked up even more steam in 2014, with $124.1 billion in issuance, easily surpassing the prior record of $97 billion in 2006. Risk retention In 2015, however, volume of CLOs issued lowered as investors eyed new risk- retention rules scheduled to go into effect at the end of 2016. These rules, among other items, require managers to retain 5% of the entire size of the CLO. Consequently, CLO issuance slipped to a still-healthy $97.34 billion in 2015, though it slowed considerably at the tail end of the year, and all but shut down in the early months of 2016, as the leveraged loan market battled investor resistance to risk in general, amid plunging oil prices. In response to the risk-retention rules, Sancus Capital Management developed the Applicable Margin Reset (AMR) protocol, which obviated the need to comply with the risk-retention rules for transactions issued prior to December 2016. However, in February 2018 the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruled that CLO managers no longer need to comply with the 5% risk- retention rules.

The school specializes in film, animation, and video game design, part of a growing number of such schools in Japan. It offers undergraduate programs in six basic fields of study: Anime, CG, Film, Web, Graphic Design, and IT Programming. The graduate and undergraduate programs are divided into smaller curricula specializing in areas such as business management, technical proficiency, arts and humanities, and international communication. It is also known for being a prominent destination for studying abroad for students from all around the world. Most of the international students are from Asian countries such as China and Korea, but there is also a number of students studying at the school who hail from western nations in North America and Europe. As of 2010, international students make up 20% of student enrollment. The President of the university, Tomoyuki Sugiyama, has said he wishes to see that number raise to 50%. Sugiyama claims that the mission of Digital Hollywood University is to embrace the growing worldwide popularity of Japanese media and entertainment, as well as the ever-increasing role of digital communication in today's society, and to give students the tools and knowledge to create a career for themselves in the digital media industry. According to Sugiyama, author of the book Cool Japan: Why the World is Buying into Japan, the nation should utilize its growing cultural popularity in the west when trying to build the future for Japan's economy. Taro Aso, former Minister for Foreign Affairs in Japan, concurs with that sentiment. In a speech given at Digital Hollywood University, he noted the significance of the fact that consumption of western media has been a huge part of defining modern popular culture in Japan, and that this trend is now seemingly beginning to reverse, with Japanese media becoming more and more popular in China, Europe, and North America, and becoming a more prominent part of pop culture for the younger generations in those areas.

In early electromechanical switches including panel switch, a \\"district junctor\\" handled supervision and talk battery duties for outgoing calls, similar to the duties of the cord circuit of manual exchanges. The junctors for incoming calls were simple three-wire connections between the incoming frame and the line frame. In the later electromechanical 5XB switch, junctors only consisted of three wires to connect the two legs of a call: the line and the trunk, of which the latter supplied all talk battery and supervision. Stored-program analog switches such as the 1ESS switch, had both simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were in the form of plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for intraoffice calls and were closely similar to intraoffice trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets.

From March 1979 to July 1984, he was a member of the PCT Political Bureau in charge of ideology and education and was the second ranking leader of the PCT. He was removed from all his positions in the party,\\"Nov 1984 - Re-election of President - Government changes\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 30, November 1984, Congo, page 33,201. including his seat on the Central Committee, and was placed under house arrest for two years in 1984. Although this decision was not officially explained, some speculated that Tchicaya was believed to have been involved in 1982 bomb attacks in Brazzaville. In August 1986, the Revolutionary Court of Justice sentenced Claude-Ernest Ndalla to death for those bomb attacks; Tchicaya was also tried, along with ten others, and he was given a five-year suspended sentence.\\"Sep 1987 - Internal political developments - Economic situation - Foreign relations\\", Keesing's Record of World Events, volume 33, September 1987, Congo, page 35,370.

Tchicaya was part of the opposition National Union for Democracy and Progress (UNDP; Union National pour la D√©mocratie et le Progr√®s) at the beginning of the transition to multiparty democracy, but he left the UNDP to found another opposition party, the RDPS, on October 29, 1990.Patrice Yengo, La guerre civile du Congo-Brazzaville, 1993-2002: \\"chacun aura sa part\\" (2006), KARTHALA Editions, page 62 .

Tchicaya backed Bernard Kol√©las of the Congolese Movement for Democracy and Integral Development (MCDDI) in the second round, but Lissouba defeated Kol√©las. After President Lissouba lost his parliamentary majority, he dissolved the National Assembly in preparation for a new parliamentary election. This led to a political crisis and the formation of a new government under Prime Minister Claude Antoine Dacosta that incorporated both Lissouba's supporters and members of the Union for Democratic Renewal (URD)-PCT opposition coalition. In this government, appointed on 25 December 1992,Africa Research Bulletin (1993), page 10847. Tchicaya was Minister of Mines, Energy and Hydrocarbons. Dacosta's \\"60/40\\" government remained in place until the time of the May-June 1993 parliamentary election, in which Tchicaya won a seat in the National Assembly. The URD-PCT opposition coalition rejected the election results as fraudulent and formed a rival government in which Tchicaya was Prime Minister; he was also named Minister of National Defense and Minister of Hydrocarbons in the rival government.Africa Research Bulletin (1993), page 11075. From 1993 to 1997 he was President of the URD Parliamentary Group. He was elected as Mayor of Pointe-Noire in July 1994, serving as Mayor from August 1994 to October 1997.

Together with Justin Lekoundzou, the President of the Parliamentary Group of the Presidential Majority, Tchicaya sent a letter to President Sassou Nguesso on March 24, 2007. In this letter, Tchicaya and Lekoundzou urged the establishment of an independent national electoral commission to oversee the election.\\"L√©gislatives 2007.

Prime Minister Isidore Mvouba described Tchicaya as a \\"great statesman\\" and a \\"worthy son of our country\\", and he said that Tchicaya had \\"always shown great consistency in his commitment to the values of the Republic and democracy\\" as a deputy in the National Assembly.Thierry Noungou, \\"Isidore Mvouba salue la m√©moire ¬´ d'un grand homme d'√âtat, digne fils du Congo ¬ª\\", Les D√©p√™ches de Brazzaville, June 21, 2008 .

This violent civil disturbance grew out of a public meeting called by the Locofocos to protest runaway prices, as hungry workers plundered private storerooms filled with sacks of hoarded flour. Commodity prices had skyrocketed over the winter of 1836‚Äì37, an inflationary boom fueled by foreign investment and two successive years of wheat crop failures. The riot was also a sign of the impending financial crisis known as the Panic of 1837, that hit the American economy the following month. Background The Panic of 1837 was largely influenced by the monetary policies of U.S. President Andrew Jackson, including the executive order known as the Specie Circular, which required hard money for the purchase of federal land in the west, in addition to subsequent changes in banking policy. These resulted in widespread rising prices and bank failures. Within two months the losses from bank failures in New York alone aggregated nearly $100 million. Out of 850 banks in the United States, 343 closed entirely, 62 failed partially, and the system of State banks received a shock from which it never fully recovered. Over the winter of the previous year, the price of flour rose from between $5.62 and $7 a barrel to $12.Zinn, Howard. A People's History of the United States. New York: Perennial Classics, 2003. p.224 The cost of meat rose substantially, with pork going from $13 to $24.50 over three years. Coal, used for home heating, did likewise, reaching $10 per ton. The prices of rent grew such that efforts were underway to organize tenants to refuse to leave their residences when their leases expired, and force their land lords to court. In February of that year, a rumor circulated that there was only three or four weeks supply of flour on hand. This was picked up in newspapers, who added reports that vast supplies were being hoarded by merchants for the purpose of driving up prices yet higher. The reports railed against \\"an atrocious and wicked conspiracy by rich speculators,\\" a group of \\"veritable vermin who prey upon the community\\". Some in the temperance movement sought to blame prices on the amount of grain used by distilleries, but the scorn of many fell on local commission merchants, with large stores of grain in their facilities. Rumors and anonymous letters began to circulate about plots to raid the stores. Events On February 10 a bulletin was posted throughout the city reading: A crowd of four to five thousand gathered as beckoned on Monday morning February 12. A succession of speakers roused them on topics ranging from Bentonian currency to high rents, monopolists, and most topically, the price of flour. The final speaker, of unknown identity, rallied the crowd to move on Hart & Co. saying: At this point someone touched his shoulder, a reminder of what he may be about to incite, and he finished \\"We shall depart in peace\\". But this final notion was lost on the crowd. They seized on the moment and advanced toward the stores. The clerks present, hearing the approaching commotion, closed and barred the doors and windows at Hart & Co, but one door left open provided the opportunity for the crowd to breach the facility and begin rolling barrels out into the street. Mr. Hart himself, gathered a detachment of police and advanced toward the warehouse. They were attacked and disarmed by the crowd, but arrived nonetheless, and frightened off those inside. The mayor hurried to the scene, but so did those gathered in the park who by now were becoming aware of what had happened. The mayor addressed the crowd and urged them to desist and disperse, but was met with stones and ice thrown with sufficient fury, that he was forced to seek safety. The crowd assaulted the warehouse, broke down the doors and out the windows, and began to roll and tumble barrels of flour into the street where they were fell upon by those present. Shortly thereafter, police arrived, followed by the National Guard. As the crowd scattered, some fell on E. J. Herrick's flour store, but were dissuaded when a representative assured them they had been selling flour at a reasonable rate. They moved on to S.H. Herric & Son and repeated the looting ritual until they were assuaged by the owner, who addressed the crowd, and promised to gift his flour to the poor the next day. The police arrived and made what arrests they could. By 9:00 PM the riot had ended, and the crowd had dispersed or been arrested. Results By the time police and militia arrived and dispersed the crowd 500 to 600 barrels of flour and a thousand bushels of wheat had been destroyed. In total, some 40 people were arrested. Within a day of the riot, a law was passed to add 192 to the ranks of the police force.

Max Martin and Lukasz Gottwald also co-wrote the song, whilst production was helmed by Gottwald under his production name Dr. Luke. It was co-produced by Steven Wolf and Max Beckley and Smit. It is a piano and guitar led song. It garnered a mixed response from music critics, with some critics praising Lewis's vocal performance and delivery, whilst others described it as emotionless. Upon the release of Spirit in November 2007, the song peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart due to strong digital download sales. It was released for US Contemporary hit radio airplay on 6 January 2009. Throughout January to March 2009, it also made an impact on the Canadian and United States charts; in the former it peaked at number 83, while it peaked at number 66 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the latter. However, it was more successful on the US Adult Pop Songs and Pop Songs charts, peaking at numbers 23 and 24, respectively. As part of promotion, a music video was shot in New York City and featured Chace Crawford as Lewis's love interest. In January 2009, she performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman. Production and recording Avril Lavigne co-wrote and originally performed the song. \\"I Will Be\\" was written by Avril Lavigne, Max Martin, Lukasz \\"Dr. Luke\\" Gottwald; it was produced by Dr. Luke, and was co-produced by Steven Wolf and Max Beckley and Smit. Lavigne originally performed the song, which was included on her third studio album The Best Damn Thing, released in April 2007, included on the bonus track edition. In the same year, Leona Lewis covered the song for her debut album Spirit, utilizing the same instrumental as Lavigne's version. Lewis's version was recorded at multiple recording studios around the world, including Conway Recording Studios and Westlake Recording Studios, in Los Angeles, California; Henson Recording Studios, Opra Music, and Ocean Way Recording, all located in Hollywood, California; Dr. Luke's personal recording studio in New York City; Atlantic Studios, Stockholm, Sweden; Sarm West, London, England. The production coordinators were Gary \\"The Shredder\\" Silver and Emily Wright. A multitude of engineers were involved with the process of recording the song, including Doug McKean, Rob Smith, Seth Waldmann, Keith Gretlin, Josh Wilbur, Tom Syrowski, Tatiana Gottwald, Chris Soper, Sam Holland, Chris Holmes, Rouble Kapoor, Wesley Seidman, Janne Hansson, Emily Wright, Marcus Dextegen and Sam Cross. \\"I Will Be\\" was mixed by Chris Lord-Alge at Resonale Recording Studios, Burbank, CA, and was assisted by Keith Armstrong and Nik Karpen. For the instrumental, Leon Pendarvis was the conductor and arranger; Martin provided piano, Dr. Luke provided the electric guitar and Yamaha Acoustic guitar, Jack Daley provided the bass and Wolf provided the drums and percussion. Composition \\"I Will Be\\" is a piano and guitar led song, which lasts for a duration of 3 minutes, 58 seconds. The song was composed in the key of G major using common time and a slow groove at 72 beats per minute. Lewis's vocal range spans two octaves, from the low note of B3 to the high note of B5, on the song. The song opens with the lyrics, \\"There's nothing I could say to you, nothing I could ever do to make you see what you mean to me.\\" Chad Grischow for IGN described the song's piano led instrumental to be \\"overblown\\", but noted that Lewis has enough \\"vocal strength to prevent her from being overshadowed by the drowningly lush sound.\\" Eric R. Danton wrote on his review of Spirit for the Hartford Courant daily that \\"I Will Be\\" begins with a \\"spare piano introduction\\" that \\"blossoms into an arrangement buoyed by strings and then drums and guitar\\". Danton described Lewis's vocals as \\"delicate\\" and that \\"take flight on the chorus\\". Response =Critical reception= The song garnered a mixed response from music critics. Nate Chinen for The New York Times was complimentary of Lewis's cover, and praised her \\"powerhouse vocals\\". Matt O'Leary for Virgin Media wrote that Lewis's rendition of the song was \\"epic\\", and that when the production is kept minimal, \\"her uniqueness is allowed to shine.\\" Although Sarah Rodman for The Boston Globe described the song as \\"predictable\\", she praised Lewis's ability to sing with \\"believable pathos\\" and hit clean notes. Sarah-Louise James for the Daily Star was critical of Lewis's rendition, and described it as insincerely emotional. Sal Cinquemani for Slant Magazine was also critical of the song, writing that it is \\"dangerously middle-of-the-road.\\" Danton from the Hartford Courant considered the song as \\"ready-made for awards shows or emotional on-screen montages.\\" He concluded that \\"I Will Be\\" is a \\"powerful stuff, and it would make for a gem of a pop record if it kept up.\\" =Chart performance= Upon the release of Spirit in the United Kingdom, \\"I Will Be\\" debuted and peaked at number 160 on the UK Singles Chart from digital download sales. Upon its release as a single in January 2009 in the United States, \\"I Will Be\\" debuted on the US Pop Songs chart at number 34 on 31 January 2009. In its second week, it rose to number 31, and again to number 28 in its third week. It peaked at number 24 and remained on the chart for eight weeks. In its seventh and eighth weeks, it charted at numbers 25 and 31, respectively. It debuted on the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 94 on 14 February 2009. It peaked at number 66, and exited the chart at number 80. The song debuted on the US Adult Pop Songs chart at number 39 on 7 March 2009, and rose to number 34 the following week. In its third and fourth weeks, the song charted at numbers 33 and 25, respectively. \\"I Will Be\\" peaked at number 23 in its fifth week on the chart, and fell to number 24 the following week. It also debuted at number 65 on the US Hot Digital Songs chart on 21 February 2009, which was also its peak. In Canada, the song entered the chart at number 86, and peaked at number 83. Music video Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford appears as Lewis' love interest and partner in crime in the music video. The music video for \\"I Will Be\\" was shot in New York City on 18 December 2008, and features Gossip Girl actor Chace Crawford as one of the characters. A reporter for People explained how the inclusion of Crawford in the video came to fruition, writing that \\"Chace went to London a couple months ago for meetings and to promote Gossip Girl. He went to a party and ended up meeting Leona. [They] hit it off and talk every once in a while and have become fast friends. A couple weeks ago Leona called Chace and asked if he would be in her next video. He obviously said yes.\\" In the video, it is presumed that Lewis and Crawford have stolen a large amount of money, as it opens with dialogue between the pair and how they are going to try and arrange to meet each other at a later date, due to the police closing in on them. As the song begins to play, Lewis sings the first verse on the car bonnet in which they were shown sitting in previously. As she sings the first chorus, she stands up and faces Crawford in the car, and begins to walk away in a car park as she sings the second verse. For the second chorus, Lewis is shown to evade the police by trying to escape by car park stairways, but is confronted by policemen wherever she goes. For the final chorus, Lewis makes it out onto the road and runs from the police in their cars, but is ultimately blocked from escape in all directions as they close in on her, arrest her, and place her in the back of a police car. People ranked the video as one of the most anticipated videos to be released in January 2009. Live performances On 20 January 2009, Lewis' performed the song on the Late Show with David Letterman.

Puszcza Zielona (, Green Wilderness) is a forest in Poland which extends from the Narew River and the border of what was once East Prussia. It is bounded on the east by the Pisa River and on the west by the Orzyc River. The forest lies in a lowland and contains a wet sandy soil, but it is rich in various minerals which are mined. The Green Wilderness (Puszcza Zielona) is usually associated with the White Wilderness (Puszcza Bia≈Ça), and together the two forests are often referred to as the Kurpie Forest (Puszcza Kurpiowska) because the two forests were populated by inhabitants who, over the centuries retained their distinct ethnic character. Due to isolation they developed a unique culture of their own, called Kurpie.  History  The forest was first ordered colonized by Masovian Prince Janusz I in the first half of the 14th Century by peasants and petty nobles. Colonization continued on and off subsequently, and its inhabitants, because of their isolation by living deep in a forest, developed a distinct culture. They retained their independence from their neighboring Poles, who give them the derogatory name of kurp≈õ, because they retained their ancient tradition of making shoes made of fibers from the linden tree and sealed with lime. Eventually, these people formed a unique culture separate from their neighboring Poles, known as Kurpie.  Current status  Because of deliberate cutting down of forest, even though the area is not suitable for agriculture, much of the forest remains in broken patches. Villages which once housed Kurpie-style structures have now been replaced, for the most part, by more modern structures.

Engraving by Jan Luyken, 1698. (Amsterdams Historisch Museum) Henri de Fleury de Coulan, Sieur de Buat, St Sire et La Forest de Gay (died October 11, 1666) was a captain of horse in the army of the Dutch Republic, who became embroiled in a celebrated conspiracy during the First Stadtholderless Period to overthrow the regime of Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt in favor of future Stadtholder William III, known as the Buat Conspiracy. He was convicted of treason in 1666 and executed. The conspiracy was romanticized in the novel \\"Elisabeth Musch\\" (1850), by Jacob van Lennep The Dutch poet Constantijn Huygens wrote the following epitaph : OP BUAT, ONTHOOFT II. OCT. 1666. EX LATINO MEO : Hier light een schuldigh man, van Hooft en Hals berooft, : Die, doen hij schuldigh weird, een‚Äô hals had, maer geen hooft. which may be translated as: : Here lies a guilty man, deprived of head and neck, : who, when he became guilty, did have a neck, but not a head Ritmeester Buat (1968) was a Dutch TV series with actor in the role of Buat Biography =Early life= Henri Buat (as he is usually known; the Anglicized first name \\"Henry\\" that is sometimes found in the literature, is not correct) was born in France as the son of colonel Philippe Henri de Fleury de Coulan (or Culan), a Huguenot officer, commanding an infantry regiment of French mercenaries in the service of the Dutch Republic,See Dutch Regiments, Infanterie Regiment 625a and Esther de Flins.Register op de Journalen van Constantijn Huygens Jr. (1906), p. 56Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 508 Not much is known about his early life. He became a page, first at the court of the Stadtholder Frederik Hendrik as a boy and then at the court of William II, where he underwent military training,Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 before he succeeded his father.Register, op. cit., p.56 He then made a career in the Dutch army, like his father, but in the cavalry. He became a captain commanding the Eskadron Gardes du Corps (Life Guards of the Stadtholder) on November 16, 1646. After the suspension of the Stadtholderate this became the Gardes te paard van de Staten van Zeeland (Horse Guards of the States of Zeeland) in 1660.See Dutch Regiments, Vaan 599a This regiment of horse was paid for by and recruited in the province of Zeeland, and it was based at Bergen op Zoom.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 Zeeland was ambivalent in its attitude to the aspirations of the Orangist party. This may explain why Buat became attached to the court of young William III in the early 1660s, while still commanding the regiment, despite the fact that, officially, the Dutch government of the day frowned on the aspirations of the Orangists. In 1659, he was a volunteer with de Ruyter's expedition to the Sound in the Northern Wars, and at Kerteminde, Buat distinguished himself during the landing of Dutch troops on the Danish island of FunenSee among others (1841) Het leven en de daden van Nederlands meest beroemde zeehelden en vlootvoogden, p. 74Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 In 1660, Buat was active in promoting the interests of the underage Prince of Orange, William III in Zeeland, and he travelled to England on behalf of the Dowager Princess of Orange, William's guardian. He went to England for the second time in 1662, receiving from Charles II, at the request of the Dowager Princess, the promise of an annuity.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 He married Elisabeth Maria Musch (not to be confused with her sister Maria Elisabeth), a daughter of Cornelis Musch, the former secretary of the States- General of the Netherlands under the Stadtholderate, and Elisabeth Cats, a daughter of Grand Pensionary Jacob Cats in 1664.Marriage contract dated March 3, 1664; see (1836) Geschiedenis des Vaderlands. Negende Deel, p. 270, fn. 1 This marriage tied him even closer to the Orangist cause, because the Musch family were ardent Orangists. In October 1665, during the Second Anglo-Dutch War he was appointed by the States of Holland to accompany the cavalry of the French army in its campaign against Munster, to assist it finding accommodation and provisions.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 =The \\"Buat Conspiracy\\"= At the end of 1665, Buat became involved in unofficial correspondence with Sir Gabriel Sylvius, then at the court of Charles II of England but earlier a member of the court of William III's late mother, Mary Stuart, when she was still alive. Sylvius was acting on behalf of Lord Arlington, a minister of Charles II, and this correspondence was originally a diplomatic \\"back channel\\" between the Dutch and English governments to explore possibilities of peace.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 At a relatively early stage, Buat made the Grand Pensionary Johan de Witt fully aware of his correspondence with Sylvius and, through him with Arlington, which not only continued with de Witt's approval, but involved Buat including material provided by de Witt, including possible peace terms.Rommelse, (2016) p.168 By February 1660, negotiations had progressed to the stage where Buat brought together Sylvius and Hieronimus van Berverning, and de Witt then invited Charles II to start formal peace negotiations through more orthodox channels.Rommelse, (2016) p.169. An outline of the English peace proposals was put forward through Buat but, after consulting the States of Holland and the French ambassador, de Witt partly rejected the proposals, but kept negotiations open by demanding a number of clarifications. Buat therefore remained in correspondence with the English government: this correspondence, however, only led to a repeated English insistence that the States General of the Netherlands should send someone to England to negotiate peace terms. Both the States of Holland and France, through its ambassador, rejected this and it was not referred to the States General. Throughout these negotiations, Buat was also in contact with members of the entourage of the Prince, principally the Lord of Zylestein, and leading Orangists, including two Rotterdam regents, Johan Kievit and Ewout van der Horst, although the Prince himself was completely unaware of this.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 Arlington and Sylvius had a further design in case the tentative peace negotiations did not bring the desired results. They plotted to bring about an Orangist coup d'√©tat in the Republic, which would overthrow the de Witt regime, restore the stadtholderate, end the war, and renew Anglo-Dutch friendship. Sylvius imprudently committed full details of this plot to paper in a letter for Buat personally, which he sent to Buat together with other letters that were intended for the eyes of de Witt. Buat was confused and handed this compromising letter over to de Witt, together with the more innocent ones.Israel, pp. 775-776 One account suggests that Buat discovered his mistake and returned to de Witt to ask for the \\"wrong\\" letter to be returned, but it was already too late: de Witt had presented the incriminating letter to the States of Holland for further action.Israel, p. 777 However, another account suggests that de Witt wished to use Buat to entrap those opposed to him, such as Kievet and van der Horst, and to discredit the Orangists generally.Rommelse, (2016) p.169 Buat was arrested (though he was given time to burn most of the incriminating letters, the drafts of which were later discovered in the English state archives).Bijdragen en mededelingen van het Historisch Genootschap. Zevenentwintigste Deel (1906), pp. VIII, 536ff. In the criminal procedures that followed it transpired that, besides Buat, only two Rotterdam regents, Johan Kievit and Ewout van der Horst, had sufficiently compromised themselves to be charged. Both escaped to England and were tried in absentia.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 Buat, however, had the misfortune to be tried for treason by the Hof van Holland (the main court of the province of Holland). This in itself was controversial, as the asserted treason was against the Generality, so that the Hoge Raad van Holland en Zeeland (the federal supreme court) might have been more appropriate. Also, according to the opinion of many contemporaries and some later historians, the Executive in the form of the States of Holland exerted undue influence in the proceedings. (1901) Robert Fruin's verspreide geschriften, p. 279ff. Even so, the Hof van Holland only voted for Buat's execution by five votes to three in October 1666. This was after the States of Holland had officially urged the reluctant court to do justice, and de Witt had written in a similar vein to some members of the court.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 In addition, he was convicted after one of the judges who might have voted in his favor (Jacob van der Graeff, the father of the would-be assassin of Johan de Witt, who was executed in 1672), had been forced to recuse himself, so altering the balance in the court,Fruin, op. cit, pp. 281ff. Many, then and now, think that Buat did not have the intent to commit treason but was the naive stooge of more sinister parties.Fruin, op. cit, p. 266 or the victim of de Witt's hatred of the House of Orange. De Witt's role was ambivalent, as he had clearly supported Buat in the peace negotiations but, when the Orangist conspiracy came to light, had wanted to demonstrate to France that Buat had acted in that matter without his knowledge.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 Although Buat had been used to further the plans of both Arlington and de Witt and may have been naive, the facts of the planned Orangist coup were clear from Sylvius's letter, even if the verdict was harsh, and the sentence of death was in accordance with a finding of treason.Molhuysen and Blok, (1911), p. 509 The sentence was publicly executed by Christiaan Hals, the Hague headsman, on October 11, 1666.

It has been established in the United Kingdom since 1969 and has also been developed in other countries including Ireland, Australia and the United States. It became necessary because of the complexity of the UK social security system and had links at the time with a growing Claimants Union movement. As local authorities realized the advantages of having well-informed front-line staff such as housing officers and social workers, who often have to deal with benefit queries as part of their wider tasks, they turned to welfare rights staff to provide that expertise for both training and handling complex cases. In the 1980s, as local authorities took on the wider 'equalities' agenda, anti-poverty work was seen as a valid local activity in itself. Increasing benefit income helps individuals but also boosts the local economy. Welfare rights in the United Kingdom Some local authorities and voluntary sector organisations, such as the Citizens Advice Bureau, employ paid or volunteer welfare rights advisers. These advisers usually offer free, impartial and independent advice, information and support on all aspects of social security benefits and tax credits, including free representation at a First-tier Tribunal and Upper Tribunal, which are administered by the UK Ministry of Justice. Welfare rights advice and representation is also provided by some solicitors, barristers and independent advisers or companies. These advisers may charge a fee or they might provide limited pro-bono (free) advice and assistance. Welfare rights advisers generally offer expert lay legal advice in dealings with public departments, such as local authority Housing Benefit and Council Tax Benefit services, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) and the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). Welfare rights advisers will generally: * Check what benefits or tax credits people may be entitled to * Assist with complex benefit application forms * Advise and represent on all aspects of social security law, including entitlement to benefits, backdating, suspensions and overpayments * Provide advocacy and representation before social security appeal Tribunals Welfare rights advisers often use a case management system to help them manage their work. These can be paper based, computer based or online. Welfare rights officers are often closely allied with campaigning groups and charities such as the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG), Citizens Advice Bureau and London Advice Service Alliance (LASA), for example. These organizations are respected for their training and publications, which are used extensively by advisers throughout the UK, as well as their campaigning activities. Welfare rights advisers' professional organization is the National Association of Welfare Rights Advisers (NAWRA) at a UK level; Scotland has its own professional association, Rights Advice Scotland (RAS). Welfare rights in the United States The Flemming Rule of 1960, named after Arthur Flemming, was an administrative ruling which decreed that states could not deny income assistance eligibility through the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program on the basis of a home being considered unsuitable per the woman's children being termed as illegitimate. In 1963 Johnnie Tillmon founded ANC (Aid to Needy Children) Mothers Anonymous, which was one of the first grassroots welfare mothers‚Äô organizations, and which eventually became part of the National Welfare Rights Organization. The National Welfare Rights Organization, active from 1966 to 1975, was an activist organization that fought for the welfare rights of people, especially women and children. The organization had four goals: adequate income, dignity, justice, and democratic participation. Johnnie Tillmon was the first chair of the organization. King v. Smith, 392 U.S. 309 (1968), was a decision in which the Supreme Court held that Aid to Families with Dependent Children could not be withheld because of the presence of a \\"substitute father\\" who visited a family on weekends. In April 1991 Cheri Honkala founded the Kensington Welfare Rights Union, a progressive social justice, political action, and advocacy group of, by, and for the poor and homeless which is operating out of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and led by Galen Tyler.

They belong to the belids or \\"primitive weevils\\" of the family Belidae. The Belidae today occur only from the Australia-New Guinea-New Zealand region to Southeast Asia, some Pacific islands, South and Central America and a few locations in Africa. The Eobelidae were more widespread, occurring at least in Central Asia, Spain and Brazil during the Late Jurassic and Early Cretaceous (about ).Ming et al.(2006) Description Adult Eobelidae are recognizable by their elongated and flat body and long rostrum (\\"snout\\"), the latter being longer than the head and pronotum together. Like in other belids, their antennae were straight, not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae); they insert near the rostrum's center. The \\"forehead\\" between the rostrum base and the eyes has a marked outward bulge. The tibiae of the middle and hind legs have spurs at their tips. Their larvae are unknown. Presumably, like the living belids, they fed on the wood and fruits of diseased or dying plants or on deadwood, with healthy plants less important as food. Given that Araucariaceae are the host plants of many of the older extant lineages of belids, it is quite likely that Eobelinae utilized these conifers too. Indeed, the Araucariaceae flourished at the same time as the Eobelidae, whereas most other known host plants of belids are angiosperms, a group of which the first primitive members (e.g. Archaefructus) lived at the same time as the Eobelidae.Marvaldi et al.(2006) Systematics They are sometimes placed as a tribe Eobelini, but the tribes of Belinae are attested in the Paleogene; the radiation of the Belinae subfamilies thus probably took place later in the Cretaceous. Thus treatment as a subfamily is most appropriate for the time being. It remains to be seen however if the Eobelidae as circumscribed here is monophyletic, or contains basal members of the extant belid subfamilies too.

The team's overall record improved the following year, but the Bobcats finished with another 7‚Äì9 record. However, the Bobcats went on a run in the MAC Tournament, winning the championship as the No. 9 seed. As a result, the Bobcats received the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament. They received a No. 14 seed in the Midwest region and Groce led the Bobcats to an upset win over No. 12-ranked and No. 3-seeded Georgetown in the First Round. They then lost in the Second Round to Tennessee. In 2011, the Bobcats increased their conference record to 9‚Äì7 and earned a bid to the CollegeInsider.com Tournament (CIT). A first round victory over Marshall preceded a loss to East Tennessee State in the CIT Quarterfinals. In 2012, Groce led the Bobcats to an 11‚Äì5 conference record and another MAC Tournament championship. As the conference's automatic bid to the NCAA Tournament, the Bobcats received a No. 13 seed.

The team won the 2012 Maui Invitational by defeating Butler in the championship game. Illinois finished the year 23‚Äì13, but with a losing conference record at 8‚Äì10. The Illini did receive a bid to the NCAA Tournament advancing to the Third Round (formerly known as the Second Round) before losing to No. 2-seeded Miami. During their 2014 season, Illinois' success in the month of November improved to 21‚Äì0 under Groce. Until losing five non-conference games in the 2015-16 season, Illinois was the only program in the nation with an undefeated November record, dating back to 2011. The Illini would slip however, finishing 20‚Äì15, 7‚Äì11 in Big Ten play and failing to make the NCAA Tournament. They did receive a bid to the NIT advancing to the second round. The Illini continued to struggle in 2015, finishing 19‚Äì14, 9‚Äì9 and again failing to make the NCAA Tournament. They did receive a bid to the NIT where they lost in the first round. Before the end of their 2016 season, new Illinois AD Josh Whitman gave John Groce a vote of confidence, praising his leadership and stating that \\"John Groce is going to continue to be our basketball coach.\\" However, the Illini finished the season 15‚Äì19, 5‚Äì13. The Illini fared better in 2017, finishing 20‚Äì15, 8‚Äì10. The team did win four in a row toward the end of the season leading to talks of an NCAA Tournament bid, but a loss at Rutgers in the final regular season game likely ended their Tournament hopes. On March 11, 2017, John Groce was relieved of his duties, two days after the Illini lost its Big Ten Tournament opening-round game to Michigan. Following Groce's dismissal, the Illini advanced to the NIT quarterfinals before losing to UCF. He was eventually replaced by Oklahoma State head coach, Brad Underwood.

The product lacks scientific evidence of effect and has been the subject of controversy and lawsuits. Following a $26 million fine by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission in 2014, the company ceased operations.  Claims  According to the advertisements promoting the Sensa diet, you can eat your favorite foods without counting calories, deprivation, or cravings. All that is needed is to sprinkle all the food one eats with flavor-enhancing Sensa crystals, and that will result in weight-loss.Kathleen M. Zelman, MPH, RD, LD -The Truth About Sensa Can 'The Sprinkle Diet' really help you lose weight? WebMD. Retrieved 21 February 2014. These \\"Sensa crystals\\" were developed by Alan Hirsch, MD, the founder and neurologic director of the Smell and Taste Treatment and Research Foundation in Chicago. The Sensa crystals (or \\"tastants\\") are said to promote feelings of fullness and, ultimately, weight loss. If a person sticks with Sensa, the website claims that a person could lose 30 pounds in six months.  Background  According to the \\"Sensa diet\\", when using the product, there is no specific diet regimen or list of food restrictions associated with Sensa. Hirsch says there was a peer-reviewed study by the Endocrine Society supporting the claim that subjects lost over thirty pounds using Sensa. However, the Endocrine Society says they did not review the study. On ABC's news magazine program 20/20, the Endocrine Society stated they \\"were surprised and troubled by the promotional nature of his presentation.\\" Senla was owned and marketed by Senla Products, LLC, its parent company, Senla, Inc., formerly Intelligent Beauty, Inc.

Adam is currently the co-CEO of TechStylehttp://www.techstyle.com/about-us/leadership/  Controversy and lawsuits  None of Sensa's internal studies have been confirmed by peer- reviewed medical journals. Critiques of Sensa-claimed research and Dr. Hirsch's research include: (1) the studies were not blinded in any directions (both researchers and subjects knew who was given Sensa and who was given a placebo, which is a conflict of interest and exposes the study to outcomes driven by the placebo effect), (2) the studies have not been open to peer review or verified by any independent medical or health organization, (3) the results have not been duplicated, (4) all studies have been conducted by organizations that are affiliated with Sensa and stand to gain financial compensation (conflicts of interests), (5) Sensa's statistical claims in their infomercials largely contradict information shown on product patents, and (6) experts from the fields of medicine that Sensa is derived from and medical experts which study and treat health-weight issues have consistently disagreed with the scientific reasoning behind Sensa, noting on numerous occasions that none of the ingredients in Sensa have shown any of the properties that the product is claimed to have.Federal Trade Commission v. Sensa Products, LLC, et al, no. 14-0072, (N.D. Ill.

Santa Cruz Nov. 20, 2012)(Stipulation for Entry of Final Judgment & Final Judgment Pursuant to Stipulation) On January 7, 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) assessed a $26.5 million fine against the company to settle charges of unfounded weight- loss claims. Under the order, the defendants are barred from making weight- loss claims about dietary supplements, foods, or drugs, unless they have two adequate and well-controlled human clinical studies supporting the claims; making any other health-related claim unless it is supported by competent and reliable scientific tests, analyses, research, or studies; and misrepresenting any scientific evidence.

It lies at the confluence of the River Beal and River Roch, east-northeast of Rochdale's town centre. Belfield is bound to the east by the Rochdale Canal, which forms Rochdale's common boundary with Firgrove in Milnrow. Historically a part of Lancashire, Belfield was formerly a hamlet within the ancient township of Butterworth, and for a time held in part by the Knights Hospitaller. Belfield derives its name from the River Beal, which flows into the area from neighbouring Milnrow. A family with the surname Belfield were living in the locality during the reign of Edward III, when lands in Butterworth were conveyed to Adam de Belfield (1278‚Äì1279). In 1293‚Äì1294 Richard de Belfield conveyed to his brother Henry, \\"all his lands lying between the Bele (River Beal) and Stonneybeck (Stanney Brook)\\". For centuries a major landmark in the area was Belfield Hall, a historic house held by local dignitaries, including Alexander Butterworth and Richard Townley, who each served as the High Sheriff of Lancashire. There is a possible moated site in Belfield (). The building on the site probably dates to c.1619 with parts rebuilt in 1752; part of the building is used as two cottages whilst the rest has been left to decay.

The 1970s saw the loss of many of the trees in the park to Dutch Elm Disease. However, in the 1990s there has been a programme of tree replanting. Also in 1996 a series of entertainment events were organised over the summer months. These have continued since and there are also craft fairs, art exhibitions and musical performances on the bandstand.

Like in other belids, their antennae are straight, not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae), and their larvae feed on the wood of diseased or dying plants or on deadwood or fruits; they tend to avoid healthy plants.Marvaldi et al. (2006) The Oxycoryninae contain a mere 13 living genera altogether, more than half of which are in the tribe Oxycorynini. Of the three tribes recognized here, two are very small but one of these, the Aglycyderini, are often treated as a distinct subfamily. However, they share several traits with other Oxycoryninae, especially with the Metrioxenini (the other minor tribe). The fossil record shows that the three tribes were well distinct by the mid- Paleogene, about . The belids as a whole are of Jurassic origin, and the Oxycoryninae must thus date from the Late Jurassic or at most Early Cretaceous, roughly some .Marvaldi et al. (2006), Ming et al. (2006) Oxycoryninae, as defined by Pascoe in 1870, refers to what today is the tribe Oxycorynini. Oxycorynidae, as defined by Kolbe in 1908, also refers to the Oxycorynini. Description Except in the Aglycyderini, the rostrum (\\"snout\\") of adult Oxycoryninae is located high on the head and the underside of the head is very much rounded; this can be appreciated in profile. The second funicle segment is not longer than the first and may be shorter. The mesothoracal sternite is flattened but between the second leg pair there is a protrusion projecting at an angle of about 45¬∞. The procoxa has no visible suture except the hole through which the trochanter tip (onto which the procoxa latches) can be seen. The first tarsal segment is tiny (shorter than the second one) and hardly visible. In the larvae, the antennae are reduced to a single segment, which bears the sensorium on a little knob. The apical segment of the maxillary palpus carries no setae, and the labium has no strut. The spiracles have soft walls without sclerotized rings. Notable genera * Aglycyderes (Aglycyderini) - occurs more than away from its closest living relatives. * Metrioxena (Metrioxenini) - prehistoric species may have lived 50 million years ago. * Parallocorynus and Rhopalotria (Oxycorynini) - the \\"cycad beetles\\" of Florida, Cuba and Central America.

Family and early life His mother was widowed, leaving her to support five children during the Great Depression on a kindergarten teacher's salary. Frank Logue and his three brothers all attended Yale University, where, after Pearl Harbor, they enlisted in the military reserves. Logue was called to active duty in 1943, served as an infantry soldier in France, and returned to Yale, graduating in 1948, and going on to attend Yale Law School. In 1947, Logue served as President of the Yale Political Union. His older brother Frank Logue's brother Edward, a Yale Law School graduate who married the daughter of William DeVane, dean of Yale College, was an influential city planner who was Mayor Richard C. Lee's right-hand man on most administrative matters and later ran for mayor of Boston. Political career Logue entered politics in Trumbull, Connecticut in 1953, becoming a Democratic district leader, then a prosecutor, and then town attorney. He ran for state representative in 1960, and lost. He served in the Kennedy administration as a part-time staff person for the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. At age 40 he moved his family to New Haven, where he organized and directed an institute to train community organizers and neighborhood workers in the War on Poverty. He later created and directed \\"National Urban Fellows\\", an urban leadership development program for minorities and women. He was subsequently elected to the New Haven Board of Aldermen, representing the city's 18th Ward for two two-year terms, from 1972 to 1975.Pamela McLoughlin, Former New Haven Mayor Frank Logue dies at 86 , New Haven Register, January 1, 2011; retrieved January 7, 2011. Bucking the New Haven Democratic party machine, he ran as a liberal reform candidate against the party's candidate, incumbent Bart Guida, in the 1975 mayoral primary and went on to win the primary and the general election. He took office as mayor on January 1, 1976. Logue ran as the standard bearer of liberal reformers looking to topple the party machine overseen by Guida's patron, the late party Chairman Arthur Barbieri. It was a heady campaign; key workers included future congresswoman Rosa DeLauro; her husband, presidential adviser Stan Greenberg; and state judge Thayer Baldwin. Once in office, Logue had the luck of presiding over the city during a period of national urban decline. Employers, retailers, and middle-class families finished a suburban exodus from New Haven that began during the heady \\"Model City\\" urban renewal period that saw a record amount of federal and foundation dollars pour into the city, only to leave it poorer. In the late 1970s, much of downtown was boarded up and a general malaise had settled over the city. Logue was an early advocate of historic preservation, an antidote to the destruction of so much of the city's landscape during urban renewal. Logue also believed the arts could help revitalize the city. He came up with the original idea of reviving the Shubert theater as part of a downtown arts renaissance, an idea his successor put into action along with an emphasis on preservation. Logue started the process of reviving downtown with the rehabilitation of the old Taft Hotel. He helped push the state to create the PILOT (payments in lieu of taxes) program for cities, in which Connecticut partially reimbursed cities for lost property tax revenues from non-profits. He won renomination in the September 1977 primary by a margin of 243 votes over challenger Biagio DiLieto and was re-elected to a second term in November of that year. However, he lost the primary to DiLieto in his bid for a third two-year term in 1979.Frank Donner (1992), Protectors of Privilege, University of California Press, , page 328. Life after the mayor's office After leaving the mayor's office, Logue was an active civic volunteer in New Haven and worked as a labor arbitrator and as a consultant to organizations including the Ford Foundation.

He and Bogni were particularly active in the Charlotte-area where they feuded with \\"The Flying Scotts\\" (George and Sandy Scott). They also had memorable feuds with George Becker and Johnny Weaver, Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, Lars and Ole Anderson and Mr. Wrestling and Sam Steamboat. Lubich also appeared as both a wrestler and manager in Texas during the early 1960s, most notably as the manager and cornerman of then NWA United States Heavyweight Champion Angelo Poffo from 1961 to 1964, and was often known to use his cane as a foreign object to help his men score victories. It was in this role that he became a well-known booker and promoter in the Dallas-Fort Worth area. He spent his last year as an active wrestler in Texas teaming with Chris Markoff where the two feuded with Mr. Wrestling and George Scott, and Johnny Valentine and Wahoo McDaniel. After his retirement, he joined Fritz von Erich's World Class Championship Wrestling as head referee and part of the booking team for the promotion until its close in 1990. He is remembered by modern wrestling fans as one of its most visible referees, especially after WCCW began airing on televised events, and was involved in several major angles and storylines in the promotion. He was the official for many high-profile matches including the long-running feud between The Freebirds vs. the Von Erich family. He was also recognizable by his distinctive \\"slow counts\\" when a wrestler attempted a pinfall. He was considered a highly respected official by wrestlers in the territory, according to interviews with former WCCW mainstays Scott Casey and Bill Mercer, and advised fellow wrestlers on both their professional careers and financial matters. Lubich, with Skandor Akbar, also had a small part in influencing the careers of several younger up-and-coming wrestlers including Mick Foley, \\"Stone Cold\\" Steve Austin, and manager Percy Pringle. Career Lubich was born Branko Sandor Lupsity (Lup≈°iƒá in Serbian) in Battonya, Hungary on December 25, 1925. His father (Mihailo) moved to Canada in 1926 and was eventually able to save enough money to bring his family over by boat to Montreal where they settled in December 1937. During his teenage years, he began working out with his friends at the local YMCA and took up amateur wrestling. He excelled in the sport and was selected to represent Canada in the 1948 Olympic Games, but he did not compete, having broken his arm while in another competition prior to the Olympics. Although choosing to continue his amateur career, he also started work at an aircraft factory shortly after to support his family. It was while working out at the Montreal YMCA that he met local wrestlers Harry Madison and Mike DiMitre who suggested a career in professional wrestling. He was initially trained by DiMitre and made his professional debut in 1948. At 6-foot, 175 pounds, he spent his early career as a lightweight wrestler under the name Bronko Lubich and began teaming with Angelo Poffo by the late 1950s. In 1959, during a match between Poffo and Wilbur Snyder in Detroit, the referee was knocked unconscious. When Snyder attempted a pinfall, Lubich entered the ring and knocked out Snyder with his cane and revived the referee in time for Poffo to score a pinfall instead. This was the first time a manager had directly interfered in a wrestling match and, at the time, was one of the biggest televised angles. A rematch between Poffo and Snyder at the Olympia Stadium was attended by 16,226 people.Lister, John. Slamthology: Collected Wrestling Writings 1991--2004\\\\. Adlibbed Ltd., 2005. (pg. 219) In 1961, Lubich made his debut in the Dallas area as the manager of Angelo Poffo. For three years, the pair would become one of the most hated \\"heels\\" in the territory. On a number of occasions, his interference saved Poffo from losing the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship. He and Poffo also held the WCWA Texas Tag Team Championship defeating Pepper Gomez and Dory Dixon in Houston, Texas on May 12, 1961. They held the titles for a month before losing them back to Gomez and Dixon on June 1. He and Poffo left the territory undefeated in 1964, Lubich moved on to Mid- Atlantic territory where he would remain for the majority of his career. It was during this time that he was teamed with Aldo Bogni, in part due to the advice of promoter Jim Crockett, Sr., with their in-ring personas portraying hostile foreign wrestlers. They were joined by manager \\"Colonel\\" Homer O'Dell, and later George \\"Two Ton\\" Harris, who quickly became one of the top \\"heel\\" tag teams in the territory. O'Dell reportedly carried a revolver and sometimes fired it behind the arena to scare off fans who sometimes waited for them outside after the event. He and Bogni were later \\"sold\\" to Harris who participated in 6-man tag team matches with them. Lubich would continue teaming with Bogni in the Carolinas, Florida and Stampede Wrestling up until the early 1970s. They faced many of the top stars of the era including the Flying Scotts, George Becker and Johnny Weaver, Rip Hawk and Swede Hanson, Lars and Ole Anderson and Mr. Wrestling and Sam Steamboat. He would also win the NWA Southern Tag Team Championship with Bogni defeating Eddie Graham and Lester Welch for the belts in West Palm Beach, Florida on March 11, 1968 before losing the titles to Jose Lothario and Joe Scarpa the next month. During the last two years of his wrestling career, he formed a tag team with Chris Markoff with whom he later won the NWA Florida Tag Team Championship from Ciclon Negro and Sam Steamboat in Tampa on October 25, 1969. They lost the titles to the Missouri Mauler and Dale Lewis on March 14, 1970 after a four-and-a-half month reign. In January 1971, he returned to the Dallas-Fort Worth area in what would be his last year as a wrestler. Joined by manager George \\"The Blimp\\" Harris III, he and Markoff feuded with longtime rivals Mr. Wrestling and George Scott as well as Johnny Valentine and Wahoo McDaniel, the latter team being considered one of the great \\"dream teams\\" of the era. He and Markoff were later approached by photographer Geoff Winningham to participate in a photoshoot for Life during a wrestling event in Houston. He was later quoted in the book Friday Night in the Coliseum describing life as a professional wrestler: Lubich and Markoff won the NWA Big Time Wrestling Tag Team Championship twice before his retirement in 1972 to become a full-time manager. He managed many of the top \\"heels\\" in the area including Bobby Duncum, Sr., The Spoiler and Boris Malenko with his men frequently battling \\"Playboy\\" Gary Hart and his stable throughout the rest of the decade. When Fritz Von Erich began promoting Southwest Sports, Jim Crockett, Sr. recommended Lubich to help go into business with von Erich. He also began refereeing for the promotion and, in 1973, refereed the NWA World Heavyweight Championship match between Jack Brisco and Harley Race in Houston. He would go on to referee matches in The Sportatorium, the North Side and Will Rogers Coliseum in Fort Worth as well as weekly appearances at venues in San Antonio, Corpus Christi and Houston. Both he and Poffo had been involved in investing stocks and bonds with Merrill Lynch early in their careers and Lubich later advised other wrestlers on investing in the stock market and other financial concerns. After Kevin Von Erich decided to close WCCW in late 1990, Lubich retired from full-time professional wrestling, he refereed occasionally for Global Wrestling Federation. Although he and his wife had planned to travel following his retirement, both he and his wife, Radmila \\"Ella\\" (nƒóe Popov) Lupsity, suffered from poor health. She was diagnosed with cancer in 1997 and died in 2004. Lubich as well had prostate cancer and suffered several strokes resulting in difficulty speaking. He died at his home on August 11, 2007 and buried at Restland Memorial Park. He is survived by his three daughters, Kathy, Maria and Melonie.

The railway system of Buckinghamshire has a long and complex history dating back to the 1830s with the opening of sections of today's West Coast Main Line and Great Western Main Line. The development of Buckinghamshire's railway network was largely due to its position nationally as many long distance routes chose to go through Buckinghamshire, especially between Britains two largest cities, London and Birmingham. The county had its own pulling power in addition, as produce such as the Aylesbury Duck could then be easily transported to the capital. The railway system expanded enormously throughout the rest of the 19th century, but over-enthusiasm led to the construction of lines that made little, if any, profit. As a result, many of these lines were closed systematically during the 1930s and 1960s. In recent years, the benefits of railway travel have become more widespread, and once again the railway network of Buckinghamshire is expanding. History =Origins= Rugby The railway boom of northern England led to the formation of the London and Birmingham Railway (L&BR;) by Robert Stephenson in 1833, with the intention of meeting Joseph Locke's Grand Junction Railway at Birmingham, creating a north-south route.Wade-Matthews (1999), p. 70 Though the rail line was initially planned to go through Buckingham, where carriage works would have been built, it was altered to Wolverton due to objection from the Duke of Buckingham. A line to Buckingham would later open in 1850. Construction of the L&BR; began in November 1833 and the section from London Euston to Boxmoor in Hertfordshire opened in 1837. The line to Bletchley was completed by the summer of 1838; from there passengers took a stagecoach shuttle from a temporary station called to Rugby where the railway continued north. The line through what is now Milton Keynes opened several months later on 17 September 1838. Wolverton later became famous as the site of Wolverton railway works which produced rolling stock for over a century‚Äîthe last new carriage was built there in 1962. The site now houses a supermarket. At the same time, another railway company, the Great Western Railway (GWR) was formed in 1833, with the intention of linking London and the growing port of Bristol. Isambard Kingdom Brunel was appointed as engineer the same year. Construction began in the mid-1830s. The line from Paddington through Buckinghamshire was opened on 4 June 1838 terminating at Maidenhead Bridge station until Maidenhead Railway Bridge was completed. The line west into Berkshire opened on 1 July 1839. The line became notable for its use of broad gauge (which was favoured by Brunel) as opposed to standard gauge, which was preferred by most other railway engineers including George and Robert Stephenson. Other railways using standard gauge later met the GWR resulting in the gauge war which the GWR eventually lost. The section through Bucks had a third rail laid on 1 October 1861 allowing both standard and broad gauge trains to run. The broad gauge was removed throughout the country in 1892. The line through Buckinghamshire was quadrupled in late 19th century. The path of the Buckinghamshire Railway, known as the Varsity line, today eventually linked Oxford and Cambridge, the section between Bedford and Cambridge opened in 1862. In 1839, a branch line opened from Cheddington on the L&BR; to Aylesbury, the county town of Buckinghamshire as a way of transporting goods, in particular the Aylesbury Duck to London. This however required a change at Cheddington, as the line was built connecting north towards Bletchley. The Aylesbury Railway, or Cheddington to Aylesbury Line was independent but operated by the L&BR; up to 1846, when the L&BR; and two other railway companies merged to form the London and North Western Railway (LNWR). From then onwards, the line was owned by the LNWR. On 17 November 1846, another line was opened: the Oxford and Bletchley Railway, which ran between Bedford and Bletchley.Wade-Matthews (1999), p. 84 Part of the railway was built on land belonging to the Duke of Bedford, as he was an enthusiastic supporter of its construction, and that part of the railway was important: one of the stations located on the Duke's land, Woburn Sands, had a brickyard that used the railway to transport its products, and the depot itself was used as the line's coal depot.Wade-Matthews (1999), p. 85 The Oxford and Bletchley Railway merged with the Buckingham and Brackley Junction Railway in 1847 to form the Buckinghamshire Railway, which was extended a year later in 1850 to Banbury. A junction was formed in 1851 at Verney for the line from there to Oxford. The Buckinghamshire Railway was worked by the LNWR from July 1851 on, and it was later absorbed by the LNWR in 1879. In July 1846, the Wycombe Railway was incorporated by an Act of Parliament, allowing the construction of a branch line from Maidenhead, in Berkshire on the GWR to High Wycombe, a major furniture producing town. Construction began in 1852 and was completed two years later in 1854. Building works included a new bridge over the River Thames; the Bourne End Railway Bridge was wooden when first built, but replaced by an iron truss bridge in 1895. The line was single track and used the broad-gauge. The Wycombe Railway was extended in 1862 to Thame with another branch from Princes Risborough to Aylesbury in 1863.There was no connection to the LNWR station at Aylesbury High Street railway station The line to Oxford was completed a year later in 1864. The Wycombe Railway was leased to the GWR, and bought outright by the GWR in 1867. The line was converted to standard gauge in 1870. Two lines serving Windsor in Berkshire opened in 1849‚Äîboth competing for traffic from the Royalty and tourists. The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway was authorised in 1847, the Staines to Windsor Line opening its first section from Staines-upon-Thames in Middlesex to Datchet in Buckinghamshire on 22 August 1848. Due to opposition from both Windsor Castle and Eton College, the line into Windsor was delayed- the line into Windsor & Eton Riverside opened on 1 December 1849. The Windsor, Staines and South Western Railway was absorbed by the London and South Western Railway (LSWR) in 1848. In the same year, 1849, the Slough to Windsor & Eton Line opened from Slough in Buckinghamshire to Windsor & Eton Central again receiving opposition from Eton College. Originally laid as broad-gauge, dual gauge, allowing standard and broad gauge trains to run was laid in 1862. For a brief period between 1883 and 1885, the District Railway ran services between London and Windsor & Eton Central via Ealing Broadway over the GWR tracks from Slough. The Aylesbury and Buckingham Railway was formed next in August 1860 to build a line between AylesburyThe current GWR Aylesbury station, not the LNWR Aylesbury High Street and Verney Junction on the LNWR Buckinghamshire Railway. It opened in 1868 but trains never ran to Buckingham- even though Verney Junction had a connection to Banbury via Buckingham. From 1871, services to Waddesdon Road operated over the Brill Tramway began. Known initially as the Wooton Tramway, it was built primarily for the use of the Third Duke of Buckingham and extended to Brill in 1872, terminating quite a distance from the village itself. The Watlington and Princes Risborough Railway opened in 1872 from the existing junction at Princes Risborough to the town of Watlington in Oxfordshire. It was operated by the GWR which originally intended to extend the line to meet the Cholsey and Wallingford Railway leading to the Great Western Main Line at Cholsey railway station, however funds were never found for the extension. =Metroland= Map of \\"Metro-land\\", from the 1924 Metro-land booklet published by the Metropolitan Railway. The county boundary of Buckinghamshire is shown. The Metropolitan Railway had been the first underground mass-transit railway system in the world when it opened in 1863. In 1868 the Metropolitan and St John's Wood Railway opened a branch from Baker Street to Swiss Cottage, that company being taken over by the Metropolitan Railway in 1879. The line was extended several times from then onwards. The line first entered Buckinghamshire on 8 July 1889 to CheshamMetro-land' by John Betjeman, BBC Television 1973 but further extension into the Chiltern Hills took place via Amersham in 1892, turning the Chesham route into a branch line. The extension of 1892 terminated at the GWR station in Aylesbury which had opened in 1863. The Metropolitan Railway was now stretching deep into Buckinghamshire, over land termed Metroland by the Met itself in 1915. In 1891, the Metropolitan had absorbed the Aylesbury & Buckingham Railway which had run from Aylesbury to Verney Junction. On 1 January 1894, the Metropolitan Railway was extended over the A&BR; to Verney Junction meeting the LNWR owned Buckinghamshire Railway which had opened in 1850. The Metropolitan Railway (popularly called the 'Met') thus ran express services from central London to Verney Junction, in the middle of rural Buckinghamshire‚Äîa testament to this being that the terminus was so rural that the station was named after the local landowner, Sir Harry Verney. The Met's final extension in Buckinghamshire was over the Brill Tramway which was absorbed on 1 December 1899, almost fifty miles out of central London. Indeed, the extent of the Metropolitan line was so great that for many years the line could not be accommodated into the London Underground Tube map. =The last main line= The railways of western Buckinghamshire at their peak. The next railway to weave its way through Buckinghamshire was the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway which had formed a network of railways in the north of England. In 1897, it changed its name to become the Great Central Railway in anticipation of its London extension. The MS&LR; had been a modest company, until Sir Edward Watkin became general manager in 1854. His ambition was to build a rail tunnel under the English Channel in which his trains would run. He was determined to build a line south to London and the South Coast- to do this he became chairman of both the South Eastern Railway which ran between London and Dover and the Metropolitan Railway. Both companies were of use to Watkin as they provided a clear route between Dover and the already existing MS&LR; near Nottingham. The Great Central Main Line in 1903. Aylesbury can be seen as a junction for the Wycombe Railway The London extension was planned to European standards and had virtually no sharp corners or steep inclines. There was to be no level crossings- everything was carried above or below the railway. Work began in 1894 still under the MS&LR; name. The estimated coast was approximately ¬£3 million and would take four years to complete; the project being in two halves, the southern section running from Rugby in Warwickshire to Quainton Road which was the Metropolitan Railway's junction for Brill and Verney Junction. From there, trains would share tracks with the Met to a new terminus at Marylebone in London. The line officially opened on 9 March 1899, although the first passenger service did not run until 16 March. The GCR main line was the last main line to be completed in Britain until the Channel Tunnel Rail Link over a century later in 2003. Although the GCR route of 1899 was the last Victorian main line to be built, one last railway line was to be built in Buckinghamshire. The Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway was a joint venture between the GWR and GCR. It was of use to the Great Western Railway as it provided a shorter route between London Paddington and Birmingham as opposed to the much longer route via Reading and Oxford. It also provided the Great Central Railway of a route by-passing the lines shared with the Metropolitan railway. Authorised in 1898, the actual joint line ran from Northolt Junction in Middlesex to Ashenden Junction in Buckinghamshire. At Northolt, the GWR route from Paddington (splitting at Old Oak Common Junction from the GWR main line) and the GCR route from Marylebone (splitting at Neasden Junction from the GCR main line) joined at a flying junction. From there the joint line entered Buckinghamshire and met the GWR 'Wycombe Railway' at High Wycombe railway station. The line then followed the route of the Wycombe Railway as far as Princes Risborough. It then preceded north-west towards Ashenden Junction, where the GWR and GCR split, the Great Western continuing through Bicester to join the existing Oxford-Birmingham line at Aynho Junction. The Great Central went northward, re-joining the main line at Grendon Underwood. The line opened in 1906 and involved considerable improvements to the existing section of the GWR 'Wycombe Railway' between High Wycombe and Princes Risborough including double track throughout and a new tunnel. =The Big Four= Between 1906 and 1936, the railway system of Buckinghamshire was at its largest. Up to 1922, it was operated by five companies, the LNWR, the LSWR, the GWR, the GCR and the Metropolitan Railway. The First World War saw the government take over control of the railway network, leading to calls for nationalisation of the railways. Both the Conservative government and the railway companies rejected the idea. A compromise was reached in the form of the Railways Act 1921,http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/11-12/55/enacted also known as the Grouping Act, which grouped all the existing companies into four new companies, known as the Big Four. Due to its position, Buckinghamshire was one of few counties to be served by all four. The act came into operation in 1923. London, Midland and Scottish Railway The LMS took over the London and North Western Railway, serving the West Coast Main Line. As it absorbed all of the LNWRs lines, it ran over the Buckinghamshire Railway and the Cheddington to Aylesbury Line. Great Western Railway The GWR was the only member of the Big Four to retain its pre-grouping identity. It operated the Great Western Main Line, as well as the Slough to Windsor & Eton Line and Wycombe Railway. London and North Eastern Railway The LNER took over running of the Great Central Railway over the Great Central Main Line. Southern Railway The SR took over operation of the London & South Western Railway, hence the only line run by the company in Buckinghamshire was the Staines to Windsor Line. =Towards nationalisation, privatisation and HS2= The Big Four ran the railways for twenty-five years. The 1920s and 1930s saw for the first time competition from the motor car. High enemployment after the First World War had caused the government to give money to county councils to improve the road network. The cash inflow allowed a large increase in car ownership and road mileage. The railways were still popular however and in 1930, the Staines to Windsor Line, run by the SR became the first railway in Buckinghamshire to be electrified, on the 660 V third rail system.. During the Second World War, the railways suffered heavy damage due to bombing by the Luftwaffe. Little money was invested into the railways and maintenance was not carried out. At the end of the war in 1945, the new labour government realised that the private sector could no longer afford the railway system and so in 1947, the Transport Act 1947 was passed, which nationalised almost all forms of mass transit in the United Kingdom from 1 January 1948. Nationalisation divided the railways into six state-owned regions, operated by British Rail.The original text for the Transport Act, 1947 can be found here Those covering Buckinghamshire were: *the Western region, which took over all GWR routes in the county *the Southern region, which took over routes from SR *the London Midland region which took over routes from the LMS. *the Eastern region which took over routes from the LNER The Beeching report saw closure of the former Great Central line north of Aylesbury (1966), and the Oxford-Bletchley 'Varsity Line' closed in 1967 (despite escaping listing by Beeching). Almost all other surviving stations and branch and connecting lines in the north of the county were also closed to passengers. But most lines in the south survived as busy London commuter routes, and new stations subsequently opened at Milton Keynes new town on the West Coast Main Line (1982); and at Haddenham & Thame Parkway (1987). Privatisation in the 1990s placed most Bucks services under the Chiltern Railways franchise, one of the most innovative of the new companies. In 2010 Chiltern opened Aylesbury Vale Parkway two miles northwest of Aylesbury; and Chiltern announced that in 2013 they would start a fast Marylebone-Oxford service via Wycombe, Risborough and a new Bicester chord. In 2011 the government announced financial support for re-opening of Aylesbury and Oxford to Milton Keynes/Bedford services, with new stations at Winslow and perhaps Newton Longville, using parts of the former Varsity and Great Central lines. Controversial proposals for High Speed 2, the new 230 mph high-speed line under the Chilterns and via the Great Central corridor, were announced by the Labour government in 2010, then enthusiastically taken up by the incoming Coalition despite strong opposition along parts of the route. The current plan is for opening in 2025, but without stations in Bucks.

She was glorified as one of the first female tractor-operators in the USSR and was made a symbol of the technically educated female Soviet worker. Biography Angelina came from Starobesheve, a village of Greek families who had moved to the region from the Crimea in the late 18th century, and she spoke both Greek and a local Turkic language; her father was a farmhand and her mother whitewashed huts.Sergei Tretyakov, ¬´–î–µ–≤—è—Ç—å –¥–µ–≤—É—à–µ–∫¬ª, –í—á–µ—Ä–∞ –∏ —Å–µ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—è: –æ—á–µ—Ä–∫–∏ —Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏—Ö —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∏—Ö –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–µ–π, Vol. 1, p. 306; tr. as \\"Nine Girls,\\" in James Von Geldern and Richard Stites (eds.), Mass Culture in Soviet Russia: Tales, Poems, Songs, Movies, Plays, and Folklore, 1917-1953 (Indiana University Press, 1995: ), p. 218. In 1929, she started attending tractor-driving courses in her native oblast while also working at a dairy farm. In 1933, she organized an all-female tractor team that was reported to have achieved 129% of the quota and thus to have ranked first among the tractor teams of the region. She was made an official Soviet celebrity, glorified in the media and depicted on propaganda posters. In 1935, she was among the \\"Champions of Agricultural Labour\\" selected to hold a conference with the leaders of the Party and state in the Kremlin. At that conference, she officially promised to organize 10 more female tractor teams in her raion. In 1938 she signed an appeal entitled \\"One hundred thousand (female) friends - onto the tractor!\\" (Russian: \\"–°—Ç–æ —Ç—ã—Å—è—á –ø–æ–¥—Ä—É–≥ - –Ω–∞ —Ç—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–æ—Ä!\\"). Women shouldering work with tractors made it possible for more men to be drafted into the Soviet army before and during World War II. During the Second World War, Angelina studied agriculture in Moscow for two years and then worked as a team leader in Kazakhstan until the end of hostilities. After the war, she returned to work in the same function in Starobeshevo. In 1948, Angelina authored an autobiographical book, Lyudi kolkhoznykh polei (\\"The people of the kolkhoz fields\\").

Awards Angelina was twice a Hero of Socialist Labor (1947, 1958), a recipient of the Stalin Prize (1946), and was bestowed three orders of Lenin and the Order of the Red Banner of Labour. She was also elected into the Supreme Soviet of the USSR in 1937, 1946 and 1950.

It was located in Colfax County, New Mexico about six miles south of Raton, New Mexico, on the Canadian River. The site is located at mile marker 344 of U.S. Route 64, just off of exit 446 on Interstate 25. Thomas L. Stockton, a rancher, built the Clifton House in 1867, using furniture, glass, and shingles that were brought overland from Dodge City, Kansas. The two-story building was made of adobe, and had a raised half-story basement. There was a veranda supported by Doric posts along the front and sides of the building, which created a promenade balcony on the second floor. Inside there were washbasins in the front hall. Other features included a large parlor, sleeping rooms with fireplaces, and a high-ceilinged dining room. Photograph of the Clifton House, New Mexico The Clifton House was a stop on the Barlow and Sanderson Stage Line, and it employed cooks and waiters to take care of the guests. Eventually, Clifton House featured a trading post, blacksmith shop, and a post office. The area around the hotel grew into a settlement known as Clifton. For a brief period of time, Clifton House was the headquarters for the English company that purchased the Maxwell Land Grant from Lucien B. Maxwell in 1870. On January 6, 1874, the Clifton House was the site of a gun fight between two gunfighters Clay Allison and Chunk Colbert, in which Colbert was killed. Previously, the local sheriff accidentally killed a waiter at the hotel while trying to apprehend Colbert. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad arrived in Otero, two miles to the north in March 1879, and stage service on the Santa Fe Trail ceased. The Clifton House was quickly abandoned, and the building was destroyed by an arsonist in 1885.

The diocese covers a large district of northeast Jutland and comprise 14 deaneries, of which four cover the extent of Aarhus city itself.  History  The diocese dates back to 948, when Adam of Bremen noted that Reginbrand, bishop of Aarhus, attended the synod of Ingelheim in Germany. It is not known if the diocese was established earlier or to what extent it functioned in Aarhus. Christianity still only enjoyed a tentative position in Denmark at the time and it is likely the diocese was created in part for missionary purposes and in part to demonstrate for the pope that the Archbishopric of Bremen was successfully converting the peoples in Scandinavia. In 988 Reginbrand died and the diocese was abolished when all dioceses in Jutland were merged to one unit with Viborg or Ribe at its center. The diocese, then a suffragan of Hamburg-Bremen, was redivided in 1060, and Christian was ordained by Adalbert I, Archbishop of Hamburg. In 1104 the diocese became a suffragan of the then newly elevated Archdiocese of Lund. In 1537 Denmark and Norway went through a Protestant reform resulting in the arrest of catholic bishops and their replacement by Lutheran clerics. In Aarhus Mads Lang was appointed bishop in 1537. Officially the row of bishops continued from the original Catholic See. The last Catholic bishop, Ove Bille resisted the Reformation, aided by Poul Helgesen, prior of the Carmelite monastery at Elsinore. Ove Bille was imprisoned for this in 1536.  Churches  IN c. 900 Frode, King of Jutland, built the Holy Trinity Church, a small wooden church situated outside the city walls of the viking settlement. In c. 1070 Bishop Christian started construction of the travertine St. Nicolai Cathedral on the site of the Holy Trinity Church. Aarhus was still predominantly pagan and at the center of the settlement within the wall lay a pagan burial site. In 1102 Bishop Ulfketil built a wooden chapel to contain the relics of Saint Clement. The St. Clement Chapel may have been the first Christian structure to be built centrally in Aarhus, within the walls and on the former pagan burial site. In c. 1180 Niels of Aarhus, llegitimate son of King Canute V of Denmark, died and was buried in the St. Clement Chapel. Niels' death was followed by stories of supernatural events and healing powers at his grave, followed by significant offerings and worship at his tomb. The worship of Niels was seen as a potential challenge to the Danish royal line of succession and Bishop Svend seemed unable or unwilling to stop it, even going as far as trying to have Niels sanctified. In 1191 the king appointed Peder Vognsen as the new bishop of Aarhus and he quickly moved to stop the unauthorized worship. In 1201 he began construction of the Saint Clement Cathedral to replace the St. Clement chapel and eradicate Niels' grave and any worship of it. The cathedral was finished in c. 1263 but that did not stop the worship of Niels. The St. Nicolai Church was named for St. Nicolai of Myra but Niels in Latin is also Nicolai. This resulted in worship of Niels simply moving to the St. Nicolai Church. In c. 1240 the Peder Vognsen gifted the Nicolai Church to the Dominican Order which subsequently turned it into a monastery and over time completely transformed the building into the Church of Our Lady. In 1330 the greater part of Aarhus Cathedral burnt down. Peder Jensen Lodehat (1386-1395) and Bo Mogensen (1395-1423) were the prelates mainly concerned in the erection of the present building.  Religious life in the diocese  There were in the diocese, at different times, a chapter with 34 prebendaries at Aarhus cathedral; Benedictines at Esbenbeek, Voer, Alling, and Veierlov; Augustinian Canons at Tvilum, Cistercians at √òm, who survived till 1560; and Carthusians at Aarhus. There were also Franciscans at Horsens and Randers, Dominicans at Aarhus, Horsens, and Randers, Carmelites and a hospital of the Holy Spirit at Aarhus. There were Hospitallers of St. John till 1568 at Horsens. Lastly there were Brigittines at Mariager from 1412 to 1592.

A black cab is a type of hackney carriage (taxicab, An Austin FX4 or a Metrocab) common to Britain. The sessions are recorded while the black cab that serves as the studio travels through city streets, usually in London, England. Most of the performances feature rock bands, ranging from popular acts such as Death Cab for Cutie, The Kooks and My Morning Jacket to lesser known acts such as the Cave Singers. Other performances stray from the rock music scene, featuring poetry and beatboxing, for example. The motto of the Black Cab Sessions is \\"one song, one take, one cab.\\" These performances have gained a cult following of viewers both on their own websitewww.blackcabsessions.com and on YouTube. Format The Black Cab Sessions video clips begin with a screen showing the name of the artist and date the session was recorded. This is followed by a shot of the cab driver, who has just been informed that his cab will play host to the sessions, introducing the artist. The artists then give their performance. During the performances, the artists often have to react to the unusual venue. For example, during the New Pornographers session, the two musicians can be seen bouncing up and down in their seats as the cab hits speed bumps. The performances are also shaped by the limited space afforded by the back of a black cab. The uploads of acoustic acts with a different premise is a very popular one, with different projects using different selling points, Acts Unsigned, Tea and Biscuit Sessions and many others using the niche to get views. Many of the bands that play are only represented by part of the band, for example. In at least one instance, when singer/harpist Joanna Newsom was invited to perform, the fact that her harp would not fit in the cab kept her from contributing at all. Production The Black Cab Sessions were conceived by Jono Stevens and produced as a partnership between Hidden Fruit (Gen Stevens and Chris Pattinson) and Just So Films (Jonny Madderson and Will Evans).

Note: There is evidence that Jack Baynton was born in 1860, not 1859. According to the FreeBMD website there was no J Baynton born in 1859 in Rushock but there was in the 2nd quarter of 1860. Also, all sources agree Baynton died 17 May 1939. FreeBMD show a John Baynton died aged 79 which leads to a birth in 1860. Early career Baynton was a pupil‚Äìteacher at St Luke's School in Blakenhall, whose football team was to become to Wolverhampton Wanderers. Baynton lined up initially for Blakenhall St. Luke's, as a centre‚Äìhalf, appearing in his first match on 15 March 1877. He became an officially registered footballer at the outset of the club in 1877 and appeared for them in various roles, including right-back and centre-forward. Not the tallest of defenders at just 5 ft 9ins, he then surprisingly changed positions to become a goalkeeper, and this became his favoured position. In the early days Baynton also acted as club secretary and treasurer. He appeared in Wolves' first-ever FA Cup tie (in October 1883) and first-ever league match (in September 1888), as well as skippering them to their first-ever silverware, the 1884 Wrekin Cup. A wholehearted outfield player and team captain, who never gave less than 100 percent, Baynton was also a very capable goalkeeper. Indeed, as a 'keeper, he once scored a goal from almost 100 yards, fly‚Äìkicking the ball downfield and between the posts when playing in a game at Dudley Road. Season 1888‚Äì1889 Jack Baynton made his League debut on 8 September 1888, as a goalkeeper for Wolverhampton Wanderers in a 1‚Äì1 draw against Aston Villa at Dudley Road. When Jack Baynton played in goal on 13 October 1888 against Burnley he was 29 years 207 days old; that made him, on that sixth weekend of League football, Wolverhampton Wanderers' oldest player. He played in the 1889 FA Cup Final, where they lost 0‚Äì3 to league champions Preston North End. Jack Baynton missed four of the \\"Wolves\\" 22 Football League matches in season 1888-89 and was part of a defence-line that kept three clean sheets and kept the opposition to one-in-a-League-match on six occasions. (registration & fee required) 1889 onwards He joined Kidderminster Olympic in April 1889 but retired the following year, continuing on as a teacher and he also took up refereeing and officiated in several first‚Äìclass matches.

Constitution  The state constitution, Article VI, Section 46, passed to repeal prohibition in 1934, prohibits the consumption of \\"intoxicating liquors\\" in a \\"saloon or other public place\\".  Retail sale of beer and wine  Beer has been available in general, privately owned, retail stores since 1934. Wine was transferred from the state-owned ABC stores system to private sale in 1981 via H.B. 1111.  Retail sale of liquor  Prior to 1990, liquor was sold only in a state owned system of stores, known as ABC Stores. In that year, the state withdrew from the retail liquor business and auctioned off permits to private businesses, who operate as \\"agents of the state\\". In smaller counties, a local monopoly was provided for, with only one agent per area, but in larger counties, multiple competing agencies were granted. Agencies are rebid every 10 years. In the 2010 rebid, the following agencies were granted: Rite-Aid drug store chain, 42 agencies CVS drug store chain, 9 agencies Seven-Eleven convenience store chain, 20 agencies Sam's Club warehouse store chain, 2 agencies Kroger grocery store chain, 1 agency Par Mar Stores 1 agency privately owned convenience stores, 31 agencies privately owned alcohol and tobacco shops, 14 agencies privately owned grocery stores, 7 agencies privately owned souvenir shop, 1 agency privately owned stand-alone liquor only stores, 40 agencies  By the drink sale of beer  In 1937, the state \\"worked around\\" the constitutional prohibition on public consumption by redefining standard beer as \\"non-intoxicating beer\\" and thus permitting the sale of this product in bars and restaurants. All beer vendors to this day are legally selling \\"non-intoxicating beer\\".  By the drink sale of wine and liquor  Following World War II, there was a desire to provide for the sale of wine and liquor by the drink, particularly in the northern parts of the state. In 1948 the state provided for the licensing of private clubs, such as veteran's organizations, fraternal organizations, and golf and country clubs, on the theory that these were not \\"public places\\". Throughout the 1950s, however state voters regularly rejected constitutional amendments which provided for public consumption. The Citizen's Committee for the Defeat of the Liquor Amendment, led by Methodist minister L.E. Crowson, campaigned across the state and participated in public debates that were instrumental in keeping the amendment from passing. Votes were generally along regional lines, with northern areas and larger cities supporting repeal, and southern and rural areas supporting the continued ban. In 1961, the state legislature found a \\"work-around\\" that short-circuited another vote. The new law provided for a new type of \\"private club\\". In actual practice, these \\"private clubs\\" are simply public places. Patrons become \\"members\\" for one dollar with the purchase of their first drink, which comes with a one dollar \\"discount\\", with the law requiring that the club may not refuse \\"membership\\" to any person over age 21. In previous years, patrons were actually issued membership cards, but this practice has fallen into disuse and 99% of patrons are unaware that they are members of any such \\"club\\". Technically, public bars and saloons remain illegal in the state to this day. The 1961 law was a part of a political deal whereby southern legislators agreed to these changes, and northern legislators withdrew their blocking of the renaming of Marshall College, which had been accredited as a \\"university\\" since 1937 and which is located in southern West Virginia, to Marshall University. This system remains in effect to this day. Such \\"clubs\\" are required to post a registry number which begins with the letter \\"ABCC\\" followed by a serial number, over their doors. The Greenbrier Resort in White Sulphur Springs, simply adds a $10 \\"alcohol membership fee\\" to the bill of all first time patrons.  Raising the ABV% Cap  Prior to July 2009, non-intoxicating beer was defined as all malt based beverages that contained at least 0.5% ABV and not more than 6% ABV. Therefore, all beer sold in WV could not contain more than 6% ABV. This effectively eliminated nearly 2/3 of all beer being produced throughout the world from being purchased in WV. Beginning in 2005 there were many attempts to raise that limit so that the WV market would be opened to the many world class beers that were, at the time, illegal to purchase in WV. The WV Beer Wholesalers Association were initially opposed to the change in the law stating that it would cause higher rates of underage drinking and DUI's. The facts however showed that this was not the case and in 2009, the WV Beer Wholesalers Association changed their stance on the subject and, along with the beer consumer advocacy group West Virginia Craft Beer Society, proceeded to lobby the Legislature to pass HB 2719, aka \\"The Craft Beer Bill\\" and change the definition of \\"non-intoxicating beer\\" to all malt based beverages between 0.5% and 12% ABV. The WV Legislature passed the bill in April 2009 and Governor Joe Manchin III signed the bill into law in July 2009. Days and hours  Retail sale of beer and wine is prohibited on Sundays between 2:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. and between 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays. Retail sale of liquor is prohibited on Sundays till 1 P.M.no sale on Easter Sunday , Christmas Day if it falls on Sunday and between 12:00 midnight and 8:00 a.m on all other days. On weekdays and Saturdays, drink establishments of all types must close by 3:30 a.m. and remain closed until 8:00 a.m. On Sundays, they must be closed between 3:00 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. In 2016, the state permitted a local option election whereby counties may change the Sunday 1:00 p.m. time to 10:00 a.m. Several counties immediately scheduled such elections for November 2016.  Drinking age and dry counties  The drinking age was 18 for beer/wine and 21 for liquor until 1972, when it was lowered to 18 for all beverages (along with the age of majority). It was then raised to 19 in 1983 (21 for non-residents) and 21 for all in 1986. Persons under 18 are also not allowed to sell alcohol. Calhoun County is ‚Äúdry.‚Äù  Cross-border issues  Because its laws are less restrictive than its neighbor states, West Virginia benefits from sales to border residents, especially from the southern part of its border with Kentucky which has several \\"dry\\" counties. Huntington also benefits from neighboring Lawrence County, Ohio having several dry townships.

He is the head coach of Varbergs BoIS.Officiellt: Persson ny tr√§nare i Varberg‚Äö fotbollskanalen.se, 28 November 2017 Club career Born in Helsingborg, Persson began his career as a youth-team player with H√∂gaborgs BK before moving to Malm√∂ FF in 1992. He made his professional debut in a Swedish Cup game against Landskrona in 1994. Persson moved to the Italian Serie A club Atalanta in 1996. He returned to Sweden after less than two seasons in Italy, having very rarely played for Atalanta's first-team, joining IFK G√∂teborg in January 1998. Things went little better for him in Sweden. He was often singled out by the media as the main cause of his team's poor performances throughout his two seasons with G√∂teborg. After the 1998 season he was voted as the \\"most overrated player\\" in the Allsvenskan by his fellow players. At the end of the 1999 season, Persson left IFK G√∂teborg in order to escape the intense scrutiny he had been subjected to. He joined Esbjerg fB, of the Danish Superliga, midway through the league season, at the end of which they were relegated to the Danish 1st Division. Persson stayed with the club and helped them to win the first division championship, and promotion, at the first attempt. In the summer of 2002, after one further season with Esbjerg, Persson moved to Hansa Rostock of the German Bundesliga. Along with Andreas Jakobsson, Marcus Lantz, Peter Wibr√•n, Magnus Arvidsson and Rade Prica, Persson was one of six Swedes playing for the Mecklenburg club. Under manager Armin Veh he played as a holding midfielder, making 26 appearances in his first season with the club. The following season began with four successive defeats, after which Veh handed in his resignation and was replaced by Juri Schl√ºnz. Schl√ºnz converted Persson from a midfielder into a defender and appointed him as the leader of the team's back four. After making just one substitute appearance in the first six games of the season, Persson went on to start 27 of the last 28 games. He scored his only league goal for Hansa in a 1‚Äì1 draw with Borussia M√∂nchengladbach on 1 November 2003. Hansa finished the season in ninth place. Persson made 30 league starts during the 2004‚Äì05 season but was unable to prevent Hansa from finishing second-bottom of the league and being relegated to the 2. Bundesliga. Following Hansa Rostock's relegation, Persson left the club to join Stab√¶k in Norway's Tippeligaen. Although he had been offered a longer contract, Persson decided to return to Sweden after 18 months in Norway. Persson signed with Landskrona prior to the 2007 Superettan season. International career Persson made 27 appearances for the Sweden U21s, scoring eight goals. He also made five appearances for Sweden at junior level, scoring one goal. Persson also made three appearances for the Sweden national football team, all of which came in the 1997 King's Cup. He played in games against Romania and Japan before playing in the final against the hosts Thailand. Persson scored a goal in the final, helping the Swedes to a 3‚Äì1 win. Personal life Persson is the father of three children.

It is the sequel to Forza Motorsport 2 and the third installment in the Forza series. The game includes more than 400 customizable cars (more than 500 cars in the Ultimate Collection version) from 50 manufacturers and more than 100 race track variations with the ability to race up to eight cars on track at a time. These cars vary from production cars to race cars such as those from the American Le Mans Series. Gameplay Forza Motorsport 3 features real world cars that race on both real and fictional courses. Here, the Super GT Yellow Hat Toyota Supra races at the fictional Sedona Raceway Park New additions to the game include an in-car driving view, one button assisted driving, vehicle rollover with detailed undercarriages, drifting, drag racing, and SUVs (Mostly Crossovers). Also new to the series is the addition of stock cars, albeit generic. Furthermore, the game also provides the ability to paint and upgrade all cars, whereas Forza Motorsport 2 only allowed for production and tuner cars to be painted or upgraded (although one downloadable Peugeot LMP could be painted). Also included is the ability to upgrade certain production and tuner cars to the race-class level (represented by the performance ratings R3, R2, and R1) whereas Forza Motorsport 2 did not, as well as the ability to create in-game videos and upload them to the Forza Motorsport website. Forza Motorsport 3 is shipped on two discs, but only utilizes one for gameplay. The second disc serves as the \\"installation disc,\\" which contains extra vehicle and track content, 1.9GB in total. Forza Motorsport 3 supports only two Force Feedback racing wheels: The Microsoft Wireless Racing Wheel and the Porsche 911 Turbo S wheel made by Fanatec. A new single-player season mode puts the player through a completely personalized racing calendar that includes more than 200 different events, including circuit, oval, drag, drift, and timed events personalized to the player's tastes. New to the series are Circuit de la Sarthe and Circuit de Catalunya. These tracks join Road Atlanta, Road America, Twin Ring Motegi, Silverstone, Laguna Seca, Tsukuba, Mugello Circuit, Sebring International Raceway, Suzuka Circuit, and N√ºrburgring Nordschleife as the licensed real-world tracks included in the game. In addition, the online multiplayer mode gains an all- new game rules editor. New Xbox Live scoreboards display not only the greatest racers but also the most prolific car tuners, and painters in the community. Forza Motorsport 3 received great recognition for its accessibility features, most notably an assist mode allowing acceleration and braking to be automatically controlled, reducing the number of inputs required to just two‚Äîleft and right, for steering. This allows compatibility with a wide range of assistive technology devices via switch access, opening up the game to players with multiple and profound disabilities that prevent them from operating a standard controller. The game includes a large variety of Xbox Live content and options available to online gamers. This is based around a completely redesigned \\"storefront\\". It allows gamers to create car designs, setup files, logos and sell them via the \\"storefront\\" to other gamers. Further flexibility is available, allowing players to select how many of each car design or logo will be available. The storefront feature is not available to Xbox Live Silver members. Xbox Live users are also able to buy and sell cars via the \\"auction house.\\" Cars are put up for a certain amount of time and for a certain amount of in-game currency. Players can choose to out-bid each other in order to buy a car. Players can also buy and sell their personalized paint jobs for cars. Development and marketing Dan Greenwalt unveiling Forza Motorsport 3 at E3 2009 During another interview at E3 2009, game director Dan Greenwalt revealed that the updated physics engine would include tire deformation, and the ability to flip the car over. He also included that there is a \\"pressure\\" system in which the A.I., depending on how the difficulty is set, would make mistakes when under pressure. In addition to improvements to the A.I. and physics, the new Photo Mode features ten times more polygons in each car model, bump mapping, and texture resolutions four times higher than before. Also, it is confirmed that the game would run at 60 frames per second. The interview also revealed that there would be several scoreboards ranging from driver scoreboards to painting and tuner leaderboards. There also would be a video editor feature available. Greenwalt stated that Project Blackjack, the team that made an E3 trailer, used capture cards to make their videos. The video editor grants players more possibilities. Players would also be able to create their own race rules but only in private matches as public matches are held through a matchmaking system that has no customization for the player. The player instead has to choose from one of the hoppers provided which are A-R class races. Unlike its predecessors, Forza Motorsport 3 doesn't support System Link.Forza Motorsport 3 At the E3 2009 Microsoft Press Conference, Turn 10 mentioned a rewind feature (much like the \\"flashback\\" feature on Race Driver: Grid and DiRT 2), but did not divulge specifics. It was later revealed at the E3 2009 coverage council that the rewind feature allows players to turn back time to fix previous mistakes made on the track. The rewind feature has no limit on how many times it may be used but afterwards the player must wait 30 seconds before being able to rewind again. It is one of the many assists in Forza Motorsport 3. Promotion at IgroMir 2009 A redeemable code was packaged with new copies of the game for a free DLC known as the \\"Motorsports Legends Car Pack\\", which includes 10 classic cars (such as the 1960 Chevrolet Corvette, 1964 Aston Martin DB5, the 1969 Dodge Charger Daytona, and the 1965 Shelby Daytona) and two extra tracks. A special Hyundai Genesis Coupe DLC pack was released for free on November 17, 2009, containing three versions of the car. The first paid downloadable content for Forza Motorsport 3 was made available on December 8, 2009. It is known as the \\"Hot Holidays\\" pack and includes the 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia and 2010 Nissan GTR SpecV. The N√ºrburgring GP Strecke was made available for download on February 9, 2010. On December 14, 2010, a \\"Community Choice Classics\\" pack was released for download. It includes the DeLorean, AMC Javelin, Chevrolet El Camino, De Tomaso Pantera, BMW 2002, and Ferrari 250. Three editions of Forza Motorsport 3 have been released: Standard and Limited Edition and a later Ultimate Collection. The Limited Edition consists of a Forza branded USB stick; a Forza branded key chain, a VIP Membership for use on the online Auction House and Community Storefront; an exclusive car pack of five cars; and a Forza Motorsport 3 theme for the Xbox 360 dashboard. In September 2009, Microsoft announced a special limited edition Xbox 360 console for Forza Motorsport 3. The unit includes a 250GB hard drive, two wireless controllers, a wired headset, and the standard edition version of the game. In October, 2010, an Ultimate Collection version was released, which includes all DLC along with several new cars including the Plymouth 'Cuda, Jaguar D-Type, Lancia 037, and Porsche 550. Also included was an exclusive DLC pack titled \\"Stig‚Äôs Garage Car Pack\\" which included the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, the Koenigsegg CCX, and the Lexus LFA. This pack was exclusive to the Ultimate Collection and angered many fans who had bought the game previously and were now excluded from having the new cars. In October 2013, all downloadable content was removed prior to the release of Forza Motorsport 5. Soundtrack In December 2009, the Forza Motorsport 3 soundtrack composed by Lance Hayes (known as DJ Drunken Master) was made available at retail and as a digital download from Sumthing Digital and iTunes. Featuring cuts from the primarily ambient electronica score; a selection of 13 tracks with over an hour of music. Unfortunately four tracks were cut from the official soundtrack, possibly due to CD time constraints, these being; Hot Wheels Hawks, Pinion, Simulated Physics, and an ambient piece from the Initial Experience. A race track entitled Oversquare is also missing. Licensed tracks also include \\"Cygnes\\" by Mr. Sam & Claud9 (music and lyrics by Claudio Pelissero) \\"\\"Tick Tick Boom\\" by The Hives, \\"Talk Me Down\\" by Mistabishi, \\"Send a Little Love Token\\" by The Duke Spirit and \\"Suburban Knights\\" by Hard-Fi. Reception Forza Motorsport 3 received \\"universal acclaim\\" like its first two predecessors according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN called it 'One of the best racing games of this generation'. Criticism mainly stemmed from the grid being much smaller than rival games (only 8 cars), the inability for users to tune their vehicles during public multiplayer racing, and the inability to create custom public multiplayer races. Turn 10 however is adding more modes to the online lobbies in an attempt to counter this problem, such as the Playground lobby which lets users play Tag Mode online in public races but custom public lobbies are currently unavailable. 411Mania gave the game a score of nine out of ten and said, \\"Turn 10 may have dethroned Gran Turismo as the sim racing King. This game is breathtaking in every sense of the word and you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find a more complete game in any genre. A must have for any racing fan.\\" The Daily Telegraph also gave it nine out of ten, saying, \\"With Forza Motorsport 3 Turn 10 have made great strides towards accessibility, but have managed to do so without compromising what remains the most open, detailed and enjoyable racing simulation on the market.\\" However, Wired gave it eight stars out of ten, saying that the game's \\"main mission\\" is \\"to deliver a realistic racing experience with more than 400 licensed cars and 100 real-world tracks. Consider that a mission accomplished ‚Äî or at the very least rewound and nailed again on the third go-round.\\" In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four nines for a total of 36 out of 40. =Awards= Forza Motorsport 3 won numerous awards. *At the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, Forza Motorsport 3 was named the Best Driving Game. *Forza Motorsport 3 was given GameSpot's Driving Game of the Year award for 2009. *Forza Motorsport 3 received the AbleGamers' Mainstream Accessible Game of the Year award for 2010. *Forza Motorsport 3 was one of GameSpot's 2009 editors' choice awards. *Forza Motorsport 3 was awarded Best Xbox 360 Racing Game of the Year by IGN. *Forza Motorsport 3 was given G4TVs Best Racing Game of 2009 award. *Forza Motorsport 3 was named CNNTech's Best Racing Game of 2009. *Forza Motorsport 3 was nominated for the Best Xbox 360 Game of the Year by GameSpot. *Forza Motorsport 3 received the 2009 Crystal Award for Driving Game of the Year.Crystal Awards 2009 - Genre Awards *Forza Motorsport 3 was given the Best Racing Game of 2009 award by GameTrailers.

Keefe made his major league debut on July 30, 1886 at the age of 19. The sixth youngest player in the league, he went 0-3 with a 5.17 ERA in four games in his first big league season. In 1887, Keefe appeared in only one game. Despite allowing 16 hits, four walks and 20 runs (only eight of which were earned), Keefe managed to complete (and lose) his only game of the season. He was also the sixth youngest player in 1887. Keefe went 6-7 with a 2.84 ERA in 13 starts in 1888. In 1889, he went 8-18 with a 5.13 ERA, finishing fifth in the league in walks allowed (143) and seventh in losses. On May 1, 1889, Keefe set the National League record for most walks in an inning, when he walked seven batters in the fifth inning. The record was subsequently tied by Bob Ewing and Tony Mullane, and Dolly Gray walked eight batters in an inning in 1909. Gray was an American League pitcher, however. Following the 1889 season, Keefe went to play for the Buffalo Bisons of the Players' League. He went 6-16 that year, posting a 6.52 ERA. He was ninth in the league in home runs allowed (11), 10th in the league in losses and 10th in the league in earned runs allowed (142). In 196 innings, he walked 138 batters and struck out only 55. Keefe played his final season in 1891 for the Washington Statesmen of the American Association. With them, he went 0-3 with a 2.68 ERA in five games (four starts). His one save was third in the league. He played his final big league game on April 28. Overall, Keefe went 20-48 in 78 games, 71 of which he started. He completed 68 games, shutting out one of them. In 616 innings, Keefe posted a 5.05 ERA, 360 walks and 213 strikeouts. In 250 career at-bats, Keefe hit .172.

Like in other belids, their antennae are straight, not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae). The Belinae make up the bulk of the diversity of living belid genera. They are found in the Australia-New Guinea-New Zealand and South America. Of the three tribes placed here, the Pachyurini appear to hold the most primitive genera, while the Agnesiotidini might be the most advanced one. The overall delimitation of tribes is not entirely robust though, and particularly the placement of the diverse Belini in respect to the Agnesiotidini is somewhat uncertain. The belids as a whole are of Jurassic origin, and the Belinae must thus date from the Late Jurassic or at most Early Cretaceous, roughly some 150 million years ago.Marvaldi et al. (2006), Ming et al. (2006) Description and ecology Belinae typically have an elongated and cylindrical shape. They can be distinguished from the Oxycoryninae (including the former Aglycyderinae) by a few characters: The scutellum of the Belinae is tipped upwards, with the base hidden by a flange at the elytra bases and the distal end pointing out between the wing bases. The sternite of the metathorax is characteristically swollen. Microscopically, it can be seen that their spermatheca are sickle- shaped, well developed and darkly pigmented. The Agnesiotidini have a groove at the hind margin of the eye, which is missing in the other two tribes.Marvaldi et al. (2006) In the larvae, the posterior margin of the pronotum is enlarged, with a more (Agnesiotidini and Belini) or less (Pachyurini) strongly thickened hind margin. In the Pachyurini, the larvae has an open and divided occipital foramen with ridges on the dorsal emargination and the labrum and epipharynx have paired and divergent paramesal sclerotizations. These are also present but curved in the Agnesiotidini; the labrum-epipharynx of the Belini is unsclerotized. The maxillary malae are densely covered with setae in the Agnesiotidini, it has only a few setae in the others. Their larvae feed on wood, mostly of Araucariaceae. Certain Belini larvae also feed on the wood of Fabaceae, while some Agnesiotidini take the wood of Myrtaceae. Some Pachyurini larvae eat the developing fruits of Nothofagaceae. Like all Belini, they prefer diseased or dying plants or deadwood to healthy plants.

It is often incorrectly referred to as a papal bull.Lehfeldt, Elizabeth A. 2000, Winter. \\"Review of Canon Law and Cloistered Women: Periculoso and Its Commentators, 1298-1545\\". Sixteenth Century Journal 31(4): 1134-1136. Canonical status Periculoso was later incorporated into the Liber Sextus, a compilation of papal legislation. Many of the specific requirements of Periculoso were often disobeyed in practice, and \\"Councils and bishops struggled manfully to put into force\\" its teachings for the next three centuries.Power, 1988, p. 345. The decretal was first confirmed in 1309 by the encyclical Apostolicae sedis of Pope Clement V.Bornstein et al., 1996, p. 67. Three 16th century papal bulls were also promulgated to reinforce the basic principles of Periculoso: Circa pastoralis (1566) and Decori et honestati (1570) of Pope Pius V and Deo sacris (1572) of Pope Gregory XIII. The Council of Trent (1563) in its final session reiterated the commandments of the decretal and added new and stiff sanctions for violators.Rapley, 2001, p. 113. By the time of the Council, the decretals dictates had largely become synonymous with traditional conceptions of nunhood; for example, the Council referred to enclosure as the \\"primary obligation for nuns\\". Some contemporary commentators regarded the regulations of Periculoso as either repetitive with or derivative of existing monastic vows; others considered it far stricter than the prevailing social contract between nuns and the ecclesiastical hierarchy at the time.Hills, 2003, p. 147.Makowski, 1997, pp. 51, 80-81. Content and application Allegory of chastity by Hans Memling Periculoso attempted both to \\"standardize\\" the lives of nuns from different houses and orders around the practice of \\"enclosure\\" and to demarcate distinctions between nuns and monks.Salih, 2001, p. 138. The severity of the enforcement of the directive varied considerably across Europe,Power, 1988, p. 354. in part because the strict enforcement of the practice of enclosure would have \\"undermine[d] the economic stability\\" of many convents because of the way they generated revenue and solicited contributions within their communities. Periculoso states: :\\"Wishing to provide for the dangerous and abominable situation of certain nuns, who, casting off the reins of respectability and impudently abandoning nunnish modesty and the natural bashfulness of their sex [‚Ä¶] we do firmly decree [‚Ä¶] that nuns collectively and individually, both at present and in future, of whatsoever community or order, in whatever part of the world they may be, ought henceforth to remain perpetually cloistered in their monasteries [‚Ä¶] so that [the nuns] be able to serve God more freely, wholly separated from the public and worldly gaze and, occasions for lasciviousness having been removed, may most diligently safeguard their hearts and bodies in complete chastity.\\"Sauer, Michelle M. 2004, March. \\"Representing the Negative: Positing the Lesbian Void in Medieval English Anchoritism\\". thirdspace 3(2). One of the main rationales for enclosure in the directive was the alleged licentiousness of many nuns; However, empirical inquiries into the prevalence of sexually active nuns reveals that most were involved with priests already incorporated into the convent or with male agents whose presence was required as a result of enclosure.Johnson, Equal in Monastic Profession, p. 124. Such results are consistent with contemporary criticism of the decretal, for example by Humbert de Romans, the Master General of the Dominican Order.Lehfeldt, 2005, p. 107. For its part, Periculoso was conscious to some degree of the financial predicaments of many monasteries, and required the careful monitoring of the size of convents in an attempt to ensure that they did not outgrow their financial supports. In the wake of the promulgation of the decretal, walls, locked doors, and barred and grated windows became nearly (but not completely) ubiquitous in monasteries.Hamilton and Spicer, 2005, p. 142. Architectural divisions became prominent markets of the regulation of the shared space that remained (such as chapels).Hamilton and Spicer, 2005, p. 145. However, the delay of the implementation of claustration in some areas was dramatic; for example, in Lower Saxony, the enclosure of female monastic communities did not become prominent until the mid-fifteenth century (due to the efforts of Johannes Busch). According to Lowe, Venice was the only state in the Italian peninsula which did not eventually implement the decretal due to a dispute between the patriarch of Grado and the pope over the nuns of S. Maria Celeste.Lowe, 2003, p. 185. One side effect of the decretal was the rapid urbanization of European monasteries, often to locations near city gates, due to economic necessity. Interpretation Elizabeth Makowski interprets the document as an attempt to \\"safeguard nuns from themselves; to diminish, if not completely remove, worldly temptations\\". Makowski further views Periculoso as a means of \\"controlling female religiosity\\" in the face of movements such as the Guglielmites which had begun to challenge papal supremacy and advocate radical roles for women in the 13th century. Brundage and Makowski conclude that Periculoso made enclosure \\"an end in itself to which other values of religious life were increasingly subordinated\\".Brundage, James A., and Makowski, Elizabeth A. 1994. \\"Enclosure of Nuns: the decretal Periculoso and its commentators\\". Journal of Medieval History 20: 153. Similarly, Rapley argues that \\"'celibacy for the kingdom,' became little by little, and exclusively for women, an end in itself to which all feminine religious life had to be subordinated.Rapley, 2001, p. 112. The document has been interpreted as a \\"watershed in the history of female monasticism\\". Departing from earlier (informal) traditions of enclosure, Periculoso focuses on the nuns' own \\"propensity for sinful behavior\\" rather than the dangers of the external world.Lehfeldt, 2005, p. 4. Some commentators have argued that Periculoso was meant only to have a symbolic impact; others that its intent was additionally to change the material conditions in nunneries across Europe.Salih, 2001, p. 140. Indeed, the decretal itself contends that \\"it is pointless indeed to make laws unless someone be designated to enforce them\\" (in the case of Periculoso, the prelates were so designated). English canonist John of Ayton commented that the decretal was merely a \\"dead letter\\" and that there was \\"scare any mortal man who could do this\\".Warren, 2001, p. 6. Of course, episcopal records abound of bishops who did in fact attempt to enforce the decretal, both successfully and unsuccessfully.

In the latter half of the 20th century, a series of controversies arose with regard to gymnast ages, some of them leading to sanctions by FIG, and paving the way for the age requirements to be raised from 14 to 15 in 1981, and then to 16 in 1997. History of age requirements in artistic gymnastics Prior to 1981, the minimum required age to compete in senior events sanctioned by the FIG (including the Olympic Games) was 14. The earliest champions in women's gymnastics tended to be in their 20s; most had studied ballet for years before entering the sport. Hungarian gymnast √Ågnes Keleti won individual gold medals at the age of 35 at the 1956 Olympics. Larisa Latynina, the first great Soviet gymnast, won her first Olympic all-around medal at the age of 21, her second at 25 and her third at 29; she became the 1958 World Champion while pregnant with her daughter.\\"Legends: Larissa Latynina\\" International Gymnast, 2001 Czech gymnast Vƒõra ƒå√°slavsk√°, who followed Latynina to become a two-time Olympic all-around champion, was 22 before she started winning gold medals at the highest level of the sport, and won her final Olympic all-around title at the age of 26. In the 1970s, the average age of Olympic gymnastics competitors began to gradually decrease. While it was not unheard of for teenagers to compete in the 1960s ‚Äî Ludmilla Tourischeva was sixteen at her first Olympics in 1968 ‚Äî they slowly became the norm, as difficulty in gymnastics increased. By the late 1970s, Federations occasionally requested permission to allow slightly underage athletes to compete as seniors. One such example is that of Canadian gymnast Karen Kelsall, who legally competed in the 1976 Olympics at the age of 13. At the time, gymnasts had to turn 14 by the start of the Games to be eligible. Kelsall, with her December 1962 birthday, was five months shy of the requirement but was turning 14 within the Olympic year, and was granted a special exemption by the FIG to compete.Gymnastics Canada biography of Karen Kelsall Such exemptions were not automatic, however: American gymnast Tracee Talavera, who was named to the United States team for the 1979 World Championships, was deemed ineligible to compete due to her age of 12¬Ω years.List of competitive results and bio at Gymn-Forum\\"Rift Over Underage Gymnasts\\" Neil Amdur, The New York Times, December 7, 1981 In response to the changing demands of the sport, at the 58th Congress of the FIG, held in July 1980 just before the Moscow Olympics, the minimum age was raised from 14 to 15. Under this rule, which went into effect in 1981, gymnasts were required to turn at least 15 years of age in the calendar year to compete in senior-level events. This age requirement remained in place until 1997, when it was raised one more year, from 15 to 16.\\"Female gymnasts: older‚Äîand healthier?\\" The Physician and Sports Medicine, Vol. 23 No. 3, March 1997\\"Romanian gymnasts faked age to compete\\" BBC News/Europe, May 2, 2002 Reasons for age restrictions Age restrictions were supposedly designed not so much to level the playing field in terms of skill and physical advantages, as to protect child athletes from injury. However, critics dispute the science behind the policy and argue that the answer is to prohibit junior gymnasts from competing in senior competitions. On the one hand, proponents such as Jeanne Dopbrak, a sports medicine physician at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, contend that \\"[a child athlete's] immature skeleton just isn't ready to handle the day-to-day stresses that will occur.\\" and that the stresses imposed on only partly developed muscular/skeletal system by gymnastics are almost certain to cause damage that would persist into adulthood. Proponents also point to a 16-year American study of gymnastics injuries which concluded that gymnastics is the most dangerous sport for girls, with injury rates comparable to those found in boys who play soccer, basketball and hockey. An athlete whose bones are still growing is more likely than an adult to suffer skeletal injury, because the bones are more porous and the joints not yet fully formed. Lesions, which are precursors to stress fractures, occur in 11 percent of young female gymnasts, compared to 2.3 percent of girls and women in general. The International Gymnastics Federation says that intense physical activity, such as that engaged in by gymnasts training at the elite level, affects the functioning of growth hormones, possibly causing delayed bone growth and the onset of puberty ‚Äì although the body is able to recover and catch up later if given rest periods. In addition, proponents contend that practicing elite sports is mentally and emotionally demanding. Young gymnasts at these levels are often pressured to perform by coaches and parents, and ex-gymnasts have spoken out about behavioural and psychological problems common to the sport. Current regulations Currently, per the 1997 regulation, gymnasts must be at least 16 years of age, or turning 16 within the calendar year, to compete in senior-level events. For the current Olympic cycle, in order to compete in the 2020 Olympics, a gymnast must have a birth date before January 1, 2005. There is no maximum age restriction, and some gymnasts compete well into their 20s. The oldest female gymnast currently competing in senior international events is Uzbekistan's Oksana Chusovitina, (b. 1975) who was old at the 2016 Summer Olympics. She was old at her first Olympics, the 1992 Summer Olympics. =Terminology= The term senior, in gymnastics, refers to any world-class gymnast who is age-eligible under F.I.G. rules. The term junior is used to describe any gymnast who competes at a world-class level, but does not meet the F.I.G.'s age minimum. Juniors are judged under the same Code of Points as the seniors, and often exhibit the same level of difficulty in their routines. =Legal exceptions= The one exception to the F.I.G.'s age restrictions until recently applied to the year before the Olympics, when gymnasts who were one year below the required age, but would be the required age in the Olympic year, were allowed to compete as seniors at the World Championships and other FIG meets. For instance, gymnasts born in 1977 were allowed to compete at senior events in 1991, when they were 14 or turning 14 within the calendar year. Within the last Olympic cycle, gymnasts born in 1992 were permitted to compete as seniors in 2007. This was permitted to allow nations to qualify to the Olympics with their best teams, and to give emerging gymnasts some experience in major competition before the Olympics. However, the FIG eliminated this exception as of the 2012 Olympic cycle.\\"Age limits for gymnasts may be set after 2008\\" Xinhua News Service, December 4, 2007 In addition, the age requirement technically only applies to meets which are sanctioned and regulated directly by the FIG: the Olympics, the World Championships and the World Cup circuit. Many other meets, such as the European Championships, have separate divisions for juniors. Additionally, some competitions, such as the Pan Am Games, the Pacific Rim Championships and the All-Africa Games, have different rules which permit seniors and juniors to compete together. There are also numerous international competitions specifically limited to junior gymnasts, such as the Japan Junior International, Moscow World Stars, the Junior Pan American Championships, and the Youth Olympic Games. =Verification procedures= According to official statements from the FIG, \\"the accepted proof of a gymnast‚Äôs eligibility for competition is a valid passport issued by the country of residence.\\" This verification process has been criticized by some in the gymnastics community, with the argument that countries can manufacture and submit falsified documents for underage athletes. In several cases, gymnasts involved in age falsification have verified that they did in fact compete under forged passports provided to them by their federations.The Secrets of a Gymnast. Norescu, Andrei, 2006 Since 2009, gymnasts competing in FIG-sanctioned events at both the senior and junior level have been required to have licenses issued by the Federation. These licenses reportedly verify the competitors' ages based on their passports. However, the licensing does not include any independent verification of submitted passport information. =Response from coaches and federations= The age limit is arguably one of the most contentious rules in gymnastics, and is frequently debated by coaches, gymnasts and members of the media. While some members of the sport, such as former USA Gymnastics president Bob Colarossi, have expressed support for the age limit of 16, others, such as coach B√©la K√°rolyi, have heavily criticized it.\\"Gymnasts are Old-lympians/Golden Girls going for gold in Sydney\\" Paula Parrish, Colorado Springs Gazette, September 14, 2000 Supporters of the age restrictions have pointed out that it has encouraged older gymnasts to remain in the sport. The average age of an international gymnast was 18.10 years in 2005. In contrast, in 1994, before the new age requirements, it was 16.49, and in 1989, gymnasts who had reached the age of 17 were already often considered to be of retirement age.\\"Gymnasts too young? FIG says the rumor is false\\" International Sports Press Association, February 13, 2007\\"Gymnastic Girls, Not Women\\" The New York Times, August 1, 1989 Opponents of the rule have countered that by barring younger gymnasts from top level meets, they are denying them valuable competitive experience. They have also argued that junior gymnasts perform and are scored under the same Code of Points as the seniors, perform the same skills, and are thus not avoiding the physical impact of training and performing high-level skills. It is also argued that the current Code of Points, with its increased requirements for difficult skills, is more suited to younger and lighter athletes, and puts older athletes at greater risk of injury.\\"Issues of Age Seem to Follow Chinese Gymnasts\\" Jere Longman, Juliet Macur. The New York Times, July 27, 2008 Age falsification Age falsification is the practice of advancing gymnasts' ages to make them age- eligible for senior-level competition. Reports of age falsification among top- level international gymnasts first began to surface in the 1980s, after the age limit was raised from 14 to 15. This has frequently taken the form of inconsistently reported birthdates; at other times, speculation has been raised due to the young appearance of the gymnasts. Age falsification has been revealed and confirmed in several ways. In some cases, gymnasts themselves have come forward and publicly confirmed and verified the falsification.Daniela Silivas, Alexandra Marinescu, Yang Yun, Lavinia Agache, Olga Mostepanova In other cases, documents revealing inconsistencies, such as original birth certificates, have been researched and uncovered by the press.Gina Gogean Inconsistencies with reported birth dates and ages at international and national competitions have also led to the discovery of age falsification.Kim Gwang Suk, Lavinia Agache, Olga Bicherova Gymnasts who have had their ages falsified, and have spoken about their experiences, have indicated that they were not given a choice in the matter. In a 2002 interview, Romanian gymnast Daniela Siliva≈ü, whose age was advanced two years in the 1980s, noted: \\"One of the officials of the Federation told me 'Look at the passport, from today you're not 13 years old anymore but 15.' Nobody asked me if I agreed to this, I was just a child. They needed gold medals and everybody who was involved in gymnastics knew about these practices.\\" While age falsification has been denied among many gymnastics officials, in recent years some have publicly admitted that the practice has occurred. In reference to the falsifications of the early 1990s and 1980s, the head of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation, Nicolae Vieru, was quoted in 2002: \\"Changing the ages was a worldwide practice...we copied this from others.\\" The FIG has publicly stated that they view age falsification as an unacceptable practice. However, there have only been three cases, those of Kim Gwang Suk in 1993 and Dong Fangxiao and Hong Su Jong in 2010, where the FIG has elected to take any action against a gymnastics federation for age falsification. =Reasons for age falsification= According to many scientific and medical studies, as well as reports from ex-gymnasts, younger gymnasts may have psychological or physical advantages in elite gymnastics competition. Psychologically, younger gymnasts may be more fearless, and have less visceral appreciation for the potential for injury. They are therefore more likely to perform more dangerous, and more highly scored, routines with confidence and steadiness. ‚ÄúPsychologically, I think they worry less,‚Äù former Olympic medallist Nellie Kim told The New York Times. Daniela Siliva≈ü, in her interview, commented, \\"You should know that I competed better at the age of 13 than at 17. I felt much better, physical (sic) and mentally.\\" Physically, younger gymnasts, particularly those who have not yet gone through puberty, tend to be lighter, smaller, more pliable and flexible, which aids them in performing more complex skills and gives them a better strength-to-weight ratio. When a gymnast hits puberty, growth spurts and weight gain may affect her centre of gravity, causing mental and physical stress as she must adjust, and in some cases relearn, her moves to compensate. Smaller athletes have generally excelled in the more challenging acrobatic elements required by the evolving Code of Points after the 1960s. In addition, older gymnasts may be more prone to certain types of injuries caused by overuse of bones and muscles; younger gymnasts are less likely to have such problems, or more likely to be able to work through pain while injured. =Major verified cases of age falsification= Kim Gwang Suk (North Korea): Kim, the 1991 World Champion on the uneven bars, was active on the international circuit between 1987 and 1993. During this time, several observers claimed she was too young for senior competition. The North Korean Gymnastics Federation submitted inconsistent dates of birth for Kim at various competitions, claiming that she was 15 for three consecutive years. As punishment, the F.I.G. barred the North Korean women's team from the World Championships in 1993. She competed in the 1989 World Championships at the estimated age of 11 or 12.\\"Gold Medalist and His Team May Be Barred From Olympic Games : Last Chance for a North Korean Athlete\\" Christopher Clarey, International Herald Times, Friday, April 19, 1996 However, she may have been younger than that.

Additionally, her blog stated she was born during the Year of the Ox, which would place her birthdate between February 1985 and February 1986.

Dorsey, a controversial carpetbagging Republican who served as United States Senator from Arkansas during the Reconstruction from 1873 until 1879. The mansion is located on US Route 56, east of Springer, New Mexico. While a senator, Dorsey purchased land near Chico Springs, New Mexico, and built a 36-room Gothic Victorian palace between 1878 and 1886. The architectural styles include log cabin (built between 1878 and 1880) as well as an Arthurian stone fortress in 1884. The dining room was the largest room in any home in the region, and it could seat 60 people. It had a marble fireplace imported from Italy. The art gallery had a cathedral ceiling, and exhibited paintings imported from overseas. There were nine bedrooms, and the first indoor toilet in the region. There was a swimming pool and fountain in the front yard facing a tower that was decorated with gargoyle representations of Dorsey, his wife, and brother. The swimming pool had three islands and a gazebo. There was a billiard room, and Dorsey held parties that were famous throughout the Southwest. Dorsey acquired much of the money for the house through corrupt mail contracts, giving him the nickname of Star Route Stephen. In 1881, President Chester Arthur ordered the prosecution of Dorsey and eight accomplices. However, the trial in Washington, DC resulted in a hung jury. Dorsey ran his Mountain Spring cattle ranch, using his famous Triangle Dot brand, content to be on the ranch because \\"my cattle do not vote.\\" In the late 1880s he established the nearby town of Clayton, New Mexico, which he named for his son Clayton. Dorsey attempted to become a leader of the Republican party in New Mexico, but his debts and lawsuits thwarted his ambitions. By 1892, Dorsey and his wife were almost destitute. For a while, the Dorseys operated the Mansion as a tuberculosis sanatorium. They moved to Los Angeles, where Dorsey's wife Helen died in 1897, and Dorsey died in 1916, almost penniless. After Helen's death, the Mansion was badly encumbered by creditor's liens. In 1901, the Mansion was sold at auction to Solomon Floersheim, one of the creditors. There were a series of owners during the first half of the 20th century. These included Dr. H. B. Masten (1902), William Van Bruggen (1907), Lewis Griggs (1912). The Post Office and Mercantile closed in the 1950s, and many of the outbuildings collapsed. K.E. Deaton bought the property and adjoining in 1966, and tried to renovate the Mansion. After Deaton's death, his heirs sold the property to the State of New Mexico in 1973. The New Mexico State Museum concluded that the Mansion was too expensive to renovate properly. On December 4, 1987, the Dorsey Mansion State Monument was sold to Dr. Roger W. Akers and Sandra Henning. They are the current owners. At present, the Mansion is not open for tours.Tour Info See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Colfax County, New Mexico References Category:Houses on the National Register of Historic Places in New Mexico Category:Houses in Colfax County, New Mexico Category:History of Colfax County, New Mexico Category:New Mexico State Register of Cultural Properties Category:National Register of Historic Places in Colfax County, New Mexico ","title":"Dorsey Mansion"},{"id":"18170056","text":"Gadai may refer to: * Gadai (clan), a sub-clan of the Bugti tribe. * Gadai, Punjab, a town in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.

The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. The Milner Arms Apartments (originally known as the Hotel Stevenson) abuts, but is not within, the district. History The four apartment buildings within this district represent the change in apartment building design in the city of Detroit: from the small luxury apartment buildings constructed just after the turn of the twentieth century to the large scale apartment buildings constructed between 1915 and 1930. Two of the four apartment buildings, the Davenport Apartment Building and the Chesterfield Apartments, were constructed by Theodore F. Shotwell during the first phase of apartment construction. These apartment buildings were small in scale, and included a small number of spacious units, designed to attract upper- and upper-middle class tenants. In 1905, Shotwell purchased land for the two buildings, and commissioned the masonry contracting and building firm of Putnam & Moore to erect the seven-unit Davenport Apartment at a cost of $10,500. In 1911, Shotwell began construction on the Chesterfield, at a cost of $26,000. The first tenants of the two buildings were lawyers, executives, and widows. As the automotive industry brought a population boom to the city of Detroit, demand for housing increased substantially. In response, apartment buildings were constructed that were larger scale, high density buildings, with many smaller and more utilitarian apartments to appeal to the primarily middle-class workers looking for housing. The remaining two apartments in this district were constructed in this time period. In 1924, John and George Pouroujalian hired architect John Bergman to design the Aderna Court Apartments, which were built for approximately $119,000. The Aderna Court contained retail space on the first floor in addition to apartments above, and some of the first commercial tenants included a beauty shop, laundry, and tavern. Also in 1924, the firm of Pollmar and Ropes designed the Naomi Apartments, which were valued at $447,000 upon completion. Of the four, only the Aderna Court Apartments have been continuously occupied.

He decided to share his dental experiences with other physicians in southern Ohio. His ‚Äúschool‚Äù for dental training yielded two colleagues, each of whom was a co-founder of one of the first two formal dental colleges in the world: The Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 1840 and the Ohio College of Dental Surgery in Cincinnati in 1845. The Ohio Medical University (OMU), founded in 1890 in Columbus, opened its doors on September 7, 1892. It was located on Park Street across from Goodale Park. It was a venture to bring health care to people in the north side of the city. Starling Ohio Medical College OMU flourished and in 1907 it merged with the Starling Medical College to become the STARLING OHIO MEDICAL COLLEGE (SOMC). The \\"colleges\\" became \\"departments\\" again. In 1912, the Ohio General Assembly passed Senate Bill 120. This authorized Ohio State University to \\"create, establish, provide for, and maintain in said University a College of Medicine and a College of Dentistry.\\" The Ohio State University College of Dentistry on Park Street In 1913, a proposal was made to merge the Starling Ohio Medical College with Ohio State University. On July 1 of 1914, the OSU Board of Trustees officially acquired the properties of the SOMC. Classes for the OSU College of Dentistry began on September 21, 1914, and graduation of its first class was held in the spring of 1915. The Theta Chapter of Omicron Kappa Upsilon, the national dental honorary society, was chartered at Ohio State in May 1916. When Ohio State University acquired its dental school in 1914, four years of high school and a diploma were the only requirements for admission and the dental curriculum lasted just three years. For the entering class of 1916, the curriculum was expanded to four years. By 1921, one year of college was required for admission, and in 1928 a minimum of two years was imposed. The Ohio State University College of Dentistry in Hamilton Hall In 1925, the Colleges of Medicine and Dentistry moved on campus to Hamilton Hall. Dentistry was located on the third and fourth floors in the north wing. The fourth floor held the main clinic and was two stories high. The roof contained skylights to enhance the light in the clinic. (When the sun is directed to the roof, one can still see a difference in the roof tiles indicating where the skylights were once positioned.) The Ohio State University College of Dentistry in Postle Hall In 1951, the College moved to a new building north of Hamilton Hall. College of Dentistry Leadership *Dr. Harry M.

The memoir chronicles the author's trip around the world after her divorce and what she discovered during her travels. The book remained on The New York Times Best Seller list for 187 weeks. The movie rights for the memoir were purchased by Columbia Pictures. The film version, which stars Julia Roberts and Javier Bardem, was released in theaters on August 13, 2010.\\"Overview ‚Äì Eat, Pray, Love (2008)\\". The New York Times. Retrieved March 19, 2011. Gilbert followed up this book with Committed: A Skeptic Makes Peace with Marriage, released through Viking in January 2010. It covered her life after Eat, Pray, Love, plus an exploration of the concept of marriage. Story At 34 years old, Elizabeth Gilbert was educated, had a home, a husband, and a successful career as a writer. She was, however, unhappy in her marriage and initiated a divorce. She then embarked on a rebound relationship that did not work out, leaving her devastated and alone. After finalizing her difficult divorce, she spent the next year traveling the world. She spent four months in Italy, eating and enjoying life (\\"Eat\\"). She spent three months in India, finding her spirituality (\\"Pray\\"). She ended the year in Bali, Indonesia, looking for \\"balance\\" of the two and fell in love with a Brazilian businessman (\\"Love\\"). Film adaptation Columbia Pictures purchased film rights for the memoir and has produced a film version under the same title. It was released on August 13, 2010. American actress Julia Roberts starred in the film; Ryan Murphy directed it. The film also stars Javier Bardem, James Franco, Richard Jenkins,\\"Five Questions for Richard Jenkins\\" . TheFasterTimes.com. Retrieved March 19, 2011. and Billy Crudup. Brad Pitt and Dede Gardner of Plan B, Pitt's production company, produced the film. Reviews Jennifer Egan of The New York Times described Gilbert's prose as \\"fueled by a mix of intelligence, wit and colloquial exuberance that is close to irresistible\\" but said that the book \\"drags\\" in the middle. She was more interested in \\"the awkward, unresolved stuff she must have chosen to leave out,\\" noting that Gilbert omits the \\"confusion and unfinished business of real life\\" and that \\"we know how the story ends pretty much from the beginning.\\" Oprah Winfrey enjoyed the book, and devoted two episodes of The Oprah Winfrey Show to it. Maureen Callahan of the New York Post heavily criticized the book, calling it \\"narcissistic New Age reading\\" and \\"the worst in Western fetishization of Eastern thought and culture, assured in its answers to existential dilemmas that have confounded intellects greater than hers.\\" In addition, she was critical of Oprah's focus on the book, as well as Oprah's fans who enjoy the book, asking why her fans are \\"indulging in this silliness\\" and why they aren't \\"clamoring for more weight when it comes to Oprah's female authors\\". Katie Roiphe of Slate agreed with Egan about the strength of Gilbert's writing. However, she described the journey as too fake: \\"too willed, too self-conscious.\\" She stated that given the apparent artificiality of the journey, her \\"affection for Eat, Pray, Love is ... furtive\\" but that \\"it is a transcendently great beach book.\\" The Washington Post Grace Lichtenstein stated that \\"the only thing wrong with this readable, funny memoir of a magazine writer's yearlong travels across the world in search of pleasure and balance is that it seems so much like a Jennifer Aniston movie.\\" Lev Grossman of Time, however, praised the spiritual aspect of the book, stating that \\"to read about her struggles with a 182-verse Sanskrit chant, or her (successful) attempt to meditate while being feasted on by mosquitoes, is to come about as close as you can to enlightenment-by- proxy.\\" He did, however, agree with Roiphe that her writing occasionally seems to be \\"trying too hard to be liked; one feels the belabored mechanism of her jokes.\\" Lori Leibovich of Salon agreed with several other reviewers about the strength of Gilbert's storytelling. She agreed with Egan as well that Gilbert seems to have an unlimited amount of luck, saying, \\"Her good fortune seems limitless\\" and asking \\"Is it possible for one person to be this lucky?\\" Entertainment Weekly Jessica Shaw said that \\"despite a few cringe-worthy turns ... Gilbert's journey is well worth taking.\\" Don Lattin of the San Francisco Chronicle agreed with Egan that the story was weakest while she was in India and questioned the complete veracity of the book. Barbara Fisher of The Boston Globe also praised Gilbert's writing, stating that \\"she describes with intense visual, palpable detail. She is the epic poet of ecstasy.\\" In early 2010, the feminist magazine Bitch published a critical review and social commentary called \\"Eat, Pray, Spend.\\" Authors Joshunda Sanders and Diana Barnes-Brown wrote that \\"Eat, Pray, Love is not the first book of its kind, but it is a perfect example of the genre of priv-lit: literature or media whose expressed goal is one of spiritual, existential, or philosophical enlightenment contingent upon women's hard work, commitment, and patience, but whose actual barriers to entry are primarily financial.\\" The genre, they argued, positions women as inherently and deeply flawed and offers \\"no real solutions for the astronomically high tariffs‚Äîboth financial and social‚Äîthat exclude all but the most fortunate among us from participating.\\"\\"Eat, Pray, Spend\\".

History  Following a theological debate in the RƒÅtana Established Church of New Zealand, Mrs. Ngapaki Hakaraia left the church to form her own movement at Kai Iwi, a settlement in New Zealand to the west of Wanganui. It is said that when Mr. Tahupotiki Wiremu RƒÅtana, Mangai, founder of the RƒÅtana Established Church of New Zealand (commonly known as RƒÅtana Church) \\"closed the Bible\\", many thought that he implied that the members of the church should not read the Bible as well. This influenced Mrs. Hakaraia into forming her own church to ensure that the Bible \\"remained open\\". However, RƒÅtana did not imply this but rather that the Bible be closed in order to stop fanciful prophecies being heralded from the Book of Revelation in the future. Following the RƒÅtana church, the Society actively engaged in politics.  Today  The church continues today with a small membership.  References  * Henderson, James Mcleod (1963).

Somewhere around or before 1920 a man named Julius Alexander Muhlberg who was co-owner of Winchester and Muhlberg, a New Jersey- based company. An innovator at heart, Julius had taken some other tool's handle, drilled a hole through a silver dollar, and after putting them both together with a nut and bolt, found it to be much faster to squish screening into the sides of a frame rather than the regular method of the time, nailing the screen into the frames.

Indonesian Communist Purge, Indonesian politicide, or the 1965 Tragedy) () were large-scale killings and civil unrest that occurred in Indonesia over several months, targeting Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI) party members, Communist sympathisers, Gerwani women, ethnic Javanese Abangan, ethnic Chinese and alleged leftists, often at the instigation of the armed forces and government. It began as an anti-communist purge following a controversial attempted coup d'√©tat by the 30 September Movement. The most widely published estimates were that 500,000 to more than one million people were killed, with some more recent estimates going as high as two to three million.Indonesia's killing fields. Al Jazeera, 21 December 2012. Retrieved 24 January 2016. The purge was a pivotal event in the transition to the \\"New Order\\" and the elimination of PKI as a political force, with impacts on the global Cold War. The upheavals led to the fall of President Sukarno and the commencement of Suharto's three-decade authoritarian presidency. The claims of a coup attempt by Communists released pent-up communal hatreds; these were fanned by the Indonesian Army, which quickly blamed the PKI. Communists were purged from political, social, and military life, and the PKI itself was disbanded and banned. The massacres began in October 1965, in the weeks following the coup attempt, and reached their peak over the remainder of the year before subsiding in the early months of 1966. They started in the capital, Jakarta, and spread to Central and East Java, and later Bali. Thousands of local vigilantes and army units killed actual and alleged PKI members. Killings occurred across the country, with the worst in the PKI strongholds of Central Java, East Java, Bali, and northern Sumatra. It is possible that over one million people were imprisoned at one time or another. Sukarno's balancing act of \\"Nasakom\\" (nationalism, religion and communism) had unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, was effectively eliminated by the other two pillars‚Äîthe army and political Islam; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power. In March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto was named Acting President. In March 1968, Suharto was formally elected president. The killings are skipped over in most Indonesian history textbooks and have received little introspection by Indonesians, due to their suppression under the Suharto regime. The search for satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence has challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \\"New Order\\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance and stigma against a perceived communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's doctrine, and it is still in force even today. Despite a consensus at the highest levels of the US and British governments that it would be necessary \\"to liquidate Sukarno\\", as related in a CIA memorandum from 1962,. notes that, prior to the mid-1950s‚Äîby which time the relationship was in definite trouble‚Äîthe US actually had, via the CIA, developed excellent contacts with Sukarno. and the existence of extensive contacts between anti- communist army officers and the US military establishment ‚Äì training of over 1,200 officers, \\"including senior military figures\\", and providing weapons and economic assistanceMacaulay, Scott (17 February 2014).

Declassified US documents in 2017 revealed that the US government had detailed knowledge of the mass killings from the beginning, and was supportive of the actions of the Indonesian Army. US complicity in the killings, which included providing extensive lists of PKI officials to Indonesian death squads, has previously been established by historians and journalists. A top-secret CIA report from 1968 stated that the massacres \\"rank as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century, along with the Soviet purges of the 1930s, the Nazi mass murders during the Second World War, and the Maoist bloodbath of the early 1950s.\\"Mark Aarons (2007). \\"Justice Betrayed: Post-1945 Responses to Genocide.\\" In David A.

Background  Major General Suharto (at right, foreground) attends a funeral for generals assassinated on 5 October 1965 Support for Sukarno's presidency under his \\"Guided Democracy\\" depended on his forced and unstable \\"Nasakom\\" coalition between the military, religious groups, and communists. The rise in influence and increasing militancy of the Communist Party of Indonesia (PKI), and Sukarno's support for it, was a serious concern for Muslims and the military, and tension grew steadily in the early and mid-1960s.Schwarz (1994), pp. 16‚Äì18 The third-largest communist party in the world,cf with Weiner (2007) p.259 the PKI had approximately 300,000 cadres and full membership of around two million.Cribb (1990), p. 41. The party's assertive efforts to speed up land reform frightened those who controlled the land and threatened the social position of Muslim clerics.Schwarz (1994), pp. 17, 21. Sukarno required government employees to study his Nasakom principles as well as Marxist theory. He had met with Zhou Enlai, Premier of the People's Republic of China, and after this meeting had decided to create a militia, called a Fifth Force, which he intended to control personally. Sukarno ordered weapons from China to equip this Fifth Force. He declared in a speech that he favoured revolutionary groups whether they were nationalist, religious or communist, stating \\"I am a friend of the Communists because the Communists are revolutionary people.\\"President Sukarno, speech on independence day, 17 August 1964 He said at a Non-Aligned Movement summit meeting in Cairo in October 1964 that his current purpose was to drive all of Indonesian politics to the left and thereby to neutralise the \\"reactionary\\" elements in the army that could be dangerous for the revolution.Andrew John Rotter (Edt.), Light at the end of the tunnel, p.273, Rowman & Littlefield Publ., 2010, Sukarno's international policies increasingly reflected his rhetoric. As early as 1958, Western powers‚Äîin particular the US and the UK‚Äîpushed for policies that would encourage the Indonesian Army to act forcefully against the PKI and the Left, which included a covert propaganda campaign designed to damage the reputation of Sukarno and the PKI, and secret assurances along with military and financial support to anti-communist leaders within the army.  30 September  On the evening of 30 September 1965, a group of militants, known as the 30 September Movement, captured and executed six of Indonesia's top military generals. The movement proclaimed itself as Sukarno's protectors, issuing a pre-emptive strike to prevent a possible coup by the \\"anti-Sukarno\\", pro- Western Council of Generals. After the execution of the generals, the movement's forces occupied Merdeka Square in Jakarta and the presidential palace. Shortly afterwards, however, President Sukarno refused to commit to the movement, for it had captured and assassinated many of his top generals. As the night continued, its poor leadership began to show, starting with a series of incoherent radio messages. The movement mainly aimed to occupy the main telecommunications building; however, it ignored the east side of the square, which was the location of Kostrad, the armed forces strategic reserve. At the time, Major General Suharto was in control of the reserve, and upon hearing the news of the takeover, he quickly capitalised on the movement's weaknesses, regaining control of the square without resistance. Following the surrender, the movement's troops did not take further action. At the same time, the Indonesian military slowly gained influence as Sukarno's waned, and within days, the government was under the control of Suharto. He immediately deployed troops and dispersed the movement, while trumpeting the movement's actions as a \\"danger\\" to the nation. A military propaganda campaign to link the coup attempt with the PKI, masterminded by Suharto and the military, began to sweep the country on 5 October, Armed Forces Day (the very day of the state funeral of all six of the killed generals). Graphic images and descriptions of the murdered, tortured, and even castrated generals began to circulate the country. Despite falsified information, the campaign was successful, convincing both Indonesian and international audiences that the murders were a PKI attempt to undermine the government under President Sukarno. Though the PKI denied involvement, pent-up tension and hatred that had built up over the years were released. Even though the 30 September Movement killed 12 people, Suharto ultimately presented it as a nationwide conspiracy to commit mass murder. Millions of people associated with the PKI, even illiterate peasants from remote villages, were presented as murderers and accomplices of the movement. Already in early 1966, two Indonesian specialists at Cornell University, Benedict Anderson and Ruth McVey, observed in their Cornell Paper that Suharto's army began the anti-communist campaign well after the 30 September Movement had collapsed. Between the moment that the movement ended and the moment that the army's mass arrests began, three weeks had elapsed in which no violence or trace of civil war occurred, even according to the army itself. Sukarno constantly protested the purge, stating that the army was \\"burning down a house to kill a rat\\", but he was powerless as Suharto commanded a firm hold on the military.  Political purge  The army removed top civilian and military leaders it thought sympathetic to the PKI.Schwarz (1994), p. 21 The parliament and cabinet were purged of Sukarno loyalists. Leading PKI members were immediately arrested, some summarily executed.Vickers (2005), p. 157. Army leaders organised demonstrations in Jakarta during which on 8 October, the PKI Jakarta headquarters was burned down.Vickers (2005), p. 157; Ricklefs (1991), p. 287 Anti-Communist youth groups were formed, including the army-backed Indonesian Students' Action Front (KAMI), the Indonesian Youth and Students' Action Front (KAPPI), and the Indonesian University Alumni Action Front (KASI).Ricklefs (1991), p. 287. In Jakarta and West Java, over 10,000 PKI activists and leaders were arrested, including famed novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer. The initial deaths occurred during organised clashes between the army and the PKI, including some Indonesian armed forces units who were sympathetic to communism and were resisting General Suharto's crackdown. For example, much of the Marine Corps, the Air Force, and the Police Mobile Brigade Corps were infiltrated up to commander level by the PKI.Vittachi (1967), p. 138 In early October, forces of the Strategic Command (Suharto's Kostrad), and the RPKAD para-commandos led by Colonel Sarwo Edhie Wibowo were sent to Central Java, a region with strong PKI support, while troops of uncertain loyalty were ordered out. At the same time, the Siliwangi Division was deployed to guard Jakarta and West Java, both of which, unlike Central and East Java, remained relatively immune to the mass killings.Vittachi (1967), p. 141 Early fighting in the Central Java highlands and around Madiun suggested the PKI might be able to establish a rival regime centred on these regions. However, widespread fears of a civil war, between factions supported by the United States and China respectively, quickly evaporated, as the forces sent by Suharto took control. Many rebel commanders chose not to fight as Suharto-deployed forces arrived, although resistance came from some, like General Supardjo, for a few more weeks. As the Sukarno presidency began to unravel and Suharto began to assert control following the coup attempt, the PKI's top national leadership was hunted and arrested with some summarily executed. In early October, PKI chairman Dipa Nusantara Aidit had flown to Central Java, where the coup attempt had been supported by leftist officers in Yogyakarta, Salatiga, and Semarang. Fellow senior PKI leader Njoto was shot around 6 November, Aidit on 22 November, and First Deputy PKI Chairman M.H. Lukman was killed shortly after that.Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Vickers (2005), p. 157  Massacres  The killings started in October 1965 in Jakarta, spread to Central and East Java and later to Bali, and smaller outbreaks occurred in parts of other islands, including Sumatra.Schwarz (1994), p. 20.Cribb (1990), p. 3. The communal tensions and hatreds that had built up were played upon by the Army leadership, which characterised Communists as villains, and many Indonesian civilians took part in the killings.Taylor (2003), p. 357. The worst massacres were in Aceh, Bali, Central and East JavaRicklefs (1991), page 287; Schwarz (1994), p. 20. where PKI support was at its strongest. The situation varied across the country, and the role of the Army has never been fully explained.Schwarz (1994), p. 21. In some areas, the Army organised, encouraged, trained, and supplied civilian groups and local militias. In other areas, communal vigilante action preceded the Army, although in most cases killings did not commence before military units had sanctioned violence by instruction or example.Vickers (2005), pages 158‚Äì159; Cribb (1990), pp. 3,21. It was in the earlier stages of the killings that the army's direct involvement in clashes with the PKI occurred. By the end of October, groups of devout Muslims joined the purge of Communists, claiming it was their duty to cleanse Indonesia of atheism. In some areas, civilian militia knew where to find known Communists and their sympathisers, while in others the Army demanded lists of Communists from village heads.Taylor (2003), p.357/ There was no disguise associated with PKI membership, and most suspects were easy to identify within communities.McDonald (1980), page 52 The US Embassy in Jakarta supplied the Indonesian military with lists of up to 5,000 suspected Communists.Vickers (2005), p. 157; Friend (2003), p. 117. Although some PKI branches organised resistance and reprisal killings, most went passively to their deaths.McDonald (1980), p. 53; Friend (2003), p. 115. Not all victims were PKI members. Often the label \\"PKI\\" was used to include anyone to the left of the Indonesian National Party (PNI).Vickers (2005), p. 158 In other cases, victims were suspected or simply alleged Communists or were victims of grievance settling with little or no political motive. Anti-Communist killings were then instigated with youths, assisted by the Army.Ricklefs (1991), pp. 287‚Äì288 Most of the victims were not major political figures and were mostly among the poor and the lower middle-class such as farmers, plantation labourers, factory workers, students, teachers, artists and civil servants. They were often targeted because they or someone they knew, such as a friend or family member, had joined the PKI or affiliated organizations. With very few exceptions, the killings were not spontaneous but carried out with a high degree of organization. Most of the victims were also detainees of the Indonesian Army, making the killings summary executions. The killings were carried out 'face to face' as in Rwanda or Cambodia, unlike the mechanical methods of killing used by Nazi Germany.Tom Allard Herald, Indonesia unwilling to tackle legacy of massacres, The Sydney Morning Herald, 13 June 2009 The methods of non- mechanised violence and killing included shooting, dismembering alive, stabbing, disembowelment, castration, impaling, strangling and beheading with Japanese-style samurai swords. Firearms and automatic weapons were used on a limited scale, with most of the killings being carried out with knives, sickles, machetes, swords, ice picks, bamboo spears, iron rods and other makeshift weapons. Islamic extremists often paraded severed heads on spikes. Corpses were often thrown into rivers, and at one point officials complained to the Army of congested rivers that run into the city of Surabaya due to the bodies. In areas such as Kediri in East Java, Nahdlatul Ulama youth wing (Ansor Youth Movement) members lined up Communists, cut their throats and disposed of the bodies in rivers.Vickers (2005), p. 158; Schwarz (1994), p. 21. Rows of severed penises were often left behind as a reminder to the rest. The killings left whole sections of villages empty, and the houses of victims or the interned were looted and often handed over to the military. Local Chinese Indonesians were killed in some areas, and their properties looted and burned as a result of anti-Chinese racism, on the excuse that D.N. Aidit had brought the PKI closer to China. In the predominantly Christian islands of Nusa Tenggara, Christian clergy and teachers suffered at the hands of Muslim youth. Although there were occasional and isolated flare-ups until 1969, the killings largely subsided by March 1966,Cribb (1990), p. 3; Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; McDonald (1980), p. 53. when either there were no more suspects, or authorities intervened.McDonald (1980), p. 53. Solo residents said that exceptionally high flooding in March 1966 of the Solo River, considered mystical by the Javanese, signalled the end of the killings. = Java = Sleman for financial donations to the elimination of the PKI In Java, much of the killing was along aliran (cultural stream) loyalties; the Army encouraged santri (more devout and orthodox Muslims) among the Javanese to seek out PKI members among the abangan (less orthodox) Javanese. The conflict that had broken out in 1963 between the Muslim party Nahdlatul Ulama (NU) and the PKI turned into killings in the second week of October. The Muslim group Muhammadiyah proclaimed in early November 1965 that the extermination of \\"Gestapu/PKI\\" constituted Holy War (\\"Gestapu\\" being the military's name for the \\"30 September Movement\\"), a position that was supported by other Islamic groups in Java and Sumatra. For many youths, killing Communists became a religious duty.Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Schwarz (1994), p. 21. Where there had been Communist centres in Central and East Java, Muslim groups portraying themselves as victims of Communist aggression justified the killings by evoking the Madiun Affair of 1948. Roman Catholic students in the Yogyakarta region left their hostels at night to join in the execution of truckloads of arrested Communists. Although, for most of the country, the killings subsided in the first months of 1966, in parts of East Java the killings went on for years. In Blitar, guerrilla action was maintained by surviving PKI members until they were defeated in 1967 and 1968. The mystic Mbah Suro, along with devotees of his Communist-infused traditional mysticism, built an army, but Suro and eighty of his followers were killed in a war of resistance against the Indonesian Army.Vickers (2005), p. 159. = Bali = Mirroring the widening of social divisions across Indonesia in the 1950s and early 1960s, the island of Bali saw conflict between supporters of the traditional Balinese caste system, and those rejecting these traditional values, particularly the PKI. Communists were publicly accused of working towards the destruction of the island's culture, religion, and character, and the Balinese, like the Javanese, were urged to destroy the PKI. Government jobs, funds, business advantage and other spoils of office had gone to the Communists during the final years of Sukarno's presidency.Taylor (2003), p. 358 Disputes over land and tenants' rights led to land seizures and killings when the PKI promoted \\"unilateral action\\".Taylor (2003), p. 358; Robinson (1995), pp. 299‚Äì302. As Indonesia's only Hindu-majority island, Bali did not have the Islamic forces involved in Java, and it was upper-caste PNI landlords who instigated the elimination of PKI members.Ricklefs (1991), p. 288. High Hindu priests called for sacrifices to satisfy spirits angered by past sacrilege and social disruption. Balinese Hindu leader Ida Bagus Oka told Hindus: \\"There can be no doubt [that] the enemies of our revolution are also the cruellest enemies of religion, and must be eliminated and destroyed down to the roots.\\"Robinson (1995), pp. 299‚Äì302. Like parts of East Java, Bali experienced a state of near civil war as Communists regrouped. The balance of power was shifted in favour of anti-Communists in December 1965, when personnel from both the Army Para- commando Regiment and 5th Brawijaya Military Region units arrived in Bali after having carried out killings in Java. Led by Suharto's principal troubleshooter, Sarwo Edhie Wibowo, Javanese military commanders permitted Balinese squads to kill until reined in.Taylor (2003), p. 359; Vickers (2005), p. 158; Vittachi (1967), p. 143 In contrast to Central Java where the Army encouraged people to kill the \\"Gestapu\\", Bali's eagerness to kill was so tremendous and spontaneous that, having provided logistic support initially, the Army eventually had to step in to prevent chaos.Friend (2003), p. 113. Sukarno's choice of Bali's provincial governor, Suteja, was recalled from office and accused of preparing a communist uprising, and his relatives were tracked down and killed.Taylor (2003), p. 358; Robinson (1995), pp. 299‚Äì302; Vittachi (1967), p. 143 A series of killings similar to those in Central and East Java were led by black-shirted PNI youth. For several months, militia death squads went through villages capturing suspects and taking them away. Hundreds of houses belonging to communists and their relatives were burnt down within one week of the reprisal crusade, with occupants being butchered as they ran from their homes. An early estimate suggested that 50,000 people, including women and children, were killed in this operation alone. The population of several Balinese villages were halved in the last months of 1965.Vittachi (1967), p. 143 All the Chinese shops in the towns of Singaraja and Denpasar were destroyed and many of their owners who were alleged to have financially supported the \\"Gestapu\\" killed. Between December 1965 and early 1966, an estimated 80,000 Balinese were killed, roughly 5% of the island's population at the time, and proportionally more than anywhere else in Indonesia.Friend (2003), p. 111; Taylor (2003), p. 358; Vickers (2005), p. 159; Robinson (1995), p. ch. 11. = Other islands = PKI-organised movements and campaigns against foreign businesses in Sumatra's plantations provoked quick reprisals against Communists, following the coup attempt. In Aceh, as many as 40,000 were killed, part of the possibly 200,000 deaths across Sumatra. Ethnic Javanese migrants were slaughtered en masse in South Sumatra.Peace Studies: Critical Concepts in Political Science, Volume 3, p. 88 The regional revolts of the late 1950s complicated events in Sumatra as many former rebels were forced to affiliate themselves with Communist organisations to prove their loyalty to the Indonesian Republic. The quelling of the 1950s revolts and 1965 killings were seen by most Sumatrans as a \\"Javanese occupation\\". In Lampung, another factor in the killings seems to have been Javanese immigration. In West Kalimantan, in 1967 after the killings ended indigenous pagan Dayaks expelled 45,000 ethnic Hakka Chinese from rural areas, killing as many as 2,000 to 5,000. The Hakka Chinese refused to fight back since they considered themselves \\"a guest on other people's land\\" with the intention of trading only. = Religious and ethnic factors = Islam in Java was divided between Abangan, who mixed Islam with other religions like Hinduism and native religious practices, and the Santri, who followed standard orthodox Islam. Many Abangans were supporters of the Communist Party,Solidarity, Volume 3, Issues 7‚Äì12 1968, p. 16. and their interests were thus supported by the PKI.Crouch 2007, p. 155. They subsequently made up most of the people who were slaughtered in the killings.Darmaputera 1988, p. 84. Abangans were targeted for attacks by Ansor, the youth wing of Nahdlatul Ulama and the Santri with help from the Indonesian army.Cribb & Kahin 2004, p. 264.Ricklefs 2008, p. 327. To avoid being classified as atheist and communists, Abangan Muslims were forced by the Indonesian government to convert to Hinduism and Christianity in the aftermath of the slaughter. In Sumatra, anti-Javanese Sumatran youths massacred the ethnic Javanese plantation labourers and PKI members throughout North Sumatra.Blank 1993, p. 289. Lombok natives slaughtered mostly ethnic Balinese all across Lombok. The targeting of ethnic Chinese played an important role in the killings in Sumatra and Kalimantan, which have been called genocide. Charles A. Coppel is sharply critical of this characterisation, in which he sees a western media and academics unwilling to face the consequences of an anti-communist agenda that they endorsed,Coppel 2008, p. 122. instead scapegoating Indonesian racism and indulging in extravagant and false claims of hundreds of thousands or millions of Chinese killed.Coppel 2008, p. 118. Charles Coppel wrote of the distorted coverage in an article titled: \\"A genocide that never was: explaining the myth of anti-Chinese massacres in Indonesia, 1965‚Äì66\\". Coppel sees the same bias in coverage of the May 1998 riots, where the Volunteer Team for Humanity noted non-Chinese looters made up the majority of those who were killed.Coppel 2008, p. 119. His thesis continues to inspire debate.Melvin, Jess (2013), Not Genocide? Anti-Chinese Violence in Aceh, 1965‚Äì1966 , in: Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs, 32, 3, 63‚Äì91. (online), (print) An estimate is that around 2,000 Chinese Indonesians were killed (out of a total estimated death toll of between 500,000 and 3 million people), with documented massacres taking place in Makassar and Medan and on the island of Lombok. Robert Cribb and Charles A. Coppel noted that \\"relatively few\\" Chinese were actually killed during the purge while the majority of the dead were native Indonesians. The death toll of Chinese was in the thousands while the death toll of native Indonesians was in the hundreds of thousands. Ethnic Balinese and Javanese made up the vast majority of people who were massacred.  Deaths and imprisonment  Although the general outline of events is known, much is unknown about the killings, and an accurate and verified count of the dead is unlikely ever to be known.Cribb (1990), p. 14. There were few Western journalists or academics in Indonesia at the time, the military was one of the few sources of information, travel was difficult and dangerous, and the regime that approved and oversaw the killings remained in power for three decades.Cribb (1990), pp. 3‚Äì4 The Indonesian media at the time had been undermined by restrictions under \\"Guided Democracy\\" and by the \\"New Order's\\" takeover in October 1966.Crouch (1978), pp. 65‚Äì66; Oey Hong Lee (1971). With the killings occurring at the height of Western fears over Communism during the Cold War, there was little investigation internationally, which would have risked complicating the West's preference for Suharto and the \\"New Order\\" over the PKI and the \\"Old Order\\".Cribb (1990), p. 5. In the first 20 years following the killings, 39 serious estimates of the death toll were attempted. Before the killings had finished, the Indonesian army estimated 78,500 had been killed,Crouch (1978), cited in Cribb (1990). p. 7. while the PKI put the figure at two million. The Indonesian army later estimated the number killed to be one million. In 1966, Benedict Anderson had set the death toll at 200,000. By 1985 he concluded that a total of 500,000 to 1 million people had been killed. Most scholars now agree that at least half a million were killed,Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Friend (2003), p. 113; Vickers (2005), p. 159; thus more than in any other event in Indonesian history. An armed forces security command estimate from December 1976 put the number at between 450,000 and 500,000. Robert Cribb suggests the most accurate figure is 500,000, though he notes it is incredibly difficult to determine the precise number of people killed.Cribb, Robert B. \\"How Many Deaths?: Problems in the statistics of massacre in Indonesia (1965‚Äì1966) and East Timor (1975‚Äì1980).\\" (2001): 82‚Äì98. However, Jan Walendouw, one of Suharto's confidants, admitted that about 1.2 million Indonesians were killed. Arrests and imprisonment continued for ten years after the purge. A 1977 Amnesty International report suggested \\"about one million\\" PKI cadres and others identified or suspected of party involvement were detained. Between 1981 and 1990, the Indonesian government estimated that there were between 1.6 and 1.8 million former prisoners \\"at large\\" in society.Friend (2003), pp. 111‚Äì112. It is possible that in the mid-1970s, 100,000 were still imprisoned without trial.Ricklefs (1991), p. 288; Vickers (2005), p. 159. It is thought that as many as 1.5 million were imprisoned at one stage or another.Vickers (2005), pp. 159‚Äì60; Weiner (2007), p. 262; Friend (2003), p. 113. Those PKI members not killed or imprisoned went into hiding while others tried to hide their past. Those arrested included leading politicians, artists and writers such as Pramoedya Ananta Toer, and peasants and soldiers. Those incarcerated in the vast network of prisons and concentration camps faced \\"extraordinarily inhumane conditions.\\" Many did not survive this first period of detention, dying from malnutrition and beatings. As people revealed the names of underground Communists, often under torture, the numbers imprisoned rose from 1966‚Äì68. Methods of torture included severe beatings with makeshift materials like electric cable and large pieces of wood, breaking fingers and crushing toes and feet under the legs of tables and chairs, pulling out fingernails, electric shocks, and burning with molten rubber or cigarettes. Detainees were sometimes forced to watch or listen to the torture of others, including relatives such as spouses or children. Both men and women were subjected to sexual violence while in detention, including rape and electric shocks to the genitals. Those released were often placed under house arrest, had to report to the military regularly, or were banned from Government employment, as were their children.  Aftermath  = Impact = Sukarno's balancing act of \\"Nasakom\\" (nationalism, religion, communism) had been unravelled. His most significant pillar of support, the PKI, had been effectively eliminated by the other two pillars‚Äîthe army and political Islam; and the army was on the way to unchallenged power.Schwarz (1994), pp. 20, 22; Ricklefs (1991), p. 288. Many Muslims were no longer trusting of Sukarno, and by early 1966, Suharto began to openly defy Sukarno, a policy which had previously been avoided by army leaders. Sukarno attempted to cling to power and mitigate the new-found influence of the army, although he could not bring himself to blame the PKI for the coup as demanded by Suharto.Schwarz (1994), p. 22. On 1 February 1966, Sukarno promoted Suharto to the rank of lieutenant general. The Supersemar decree of 11 March 1966 transferred much of Sukarno's power over the parliament and army to Suharto,Vickers (2005), page 160 ostensibly allowing Suharto to do whatever was needed to restore order. On 12 March 1967, Sukarno was stripped of his remaining power by Indonesia's provisional Parliament, and Suharto named Acting President.Schwartz (1994), page 2 On 21 March 1968, the Provisional People's Consultative Assembly formally elected Suharto as president.Ricklefs (1991), p. 295. Several hundred or thousand Indonesian leftists travelling abroad were unable to return to their homeland. Djawoto, the ambassador to China, refused to be recalled and spent the rest of his life outside of Indonesia.Encyclopedia of Jakarta. Djawoto Some of these exiles, writers by trade, continued writing. This Indonesian exile literature was full of hatred for the new government and written simply, for general consumption, but necessarily published internationally. In December 1965, the US embassy in Jakarta had sent a telegram to Washington stating that without the uprising, \\"removal of foreign oil companies would have been a certainty.\\" In late 1968, the National Intelligence Estimate for Indonesia reported: \\"An essential part of the Suharto government's economic program ... has been to welcome foreign capital back to Indonesia. Already about 25 American and European firms have recovered control of mines, estates, and other enterprises nationalized under Sukarno. Liberal legislation has been enacted to attract new private foreign investment. ... There is substantial foreign investment in relatively untapped resources of nickel, copper, bauxite, and timber. The most promising industry ... is oil.\\" The killings served as a direct precedent for the genocidal invasion and occupation of East Timor. The same generals oversaw the killing in both situations and encouraged equally brutal methods‚Äîwith impunity.Thaler, Kai (August/December 2012). \\"Foreshadowing Future Slaughter: From the Indonesian Killings of 1965‚Äì1966 to the 1974‚Äì1999 Genocide in East Timor\\". Genocide Studies and Prevention Vol. 7, No. 2/3, pp. 204‚Äì222. \\"There were many parallels between the two mass killings committed by the New Order: the involvement of the same clique of generals; allegations of Communism; targeting of Chinese; gender and sexual violence; tactics like pagar betis and the delegation of violence to non-state actors; and a violent rhetoric of extermination, often couched in biological and genetic terms. Another common factor is that there has been no prosecution of the perpetrators in either case.\\" = Global reaction = To Western governments, the killings and purges were seen as victory over Communism at the height of the Cold War. Western governments and much of the West's media preferred Suharto and the \\"New Order\\" to the PKI and the increasingly leftist \\"Old Order\\".Cribb (1990), p. 5; Schwarz (1994), p. 22. The British ambassador, Andrew Gilchrist, wrote to London: \\"I never concealed from you my belief that a little shooting in Indonesia would be an essential preliminary to effective change.\\" News of the massacre was carefully controlled by Western intelligence agencies. Journalists, prevented from entering Indonesia, relied on the official statements from Western embassies. The British embassy in Jakarta advised intelligence headquarters in Singapore on how the news should be presented: \\"Suitable propaganda themes might be: PKI brutality in murdering Generals, ... PKI subverting Indonesia as agents of foreign Communists. ... British participation should be carefully concealed.\\" A headline in U.S. News & World Report read: \\"Indonesia: Hope... where there was once none\\".US News and World Report, 6 June 1966 Australian Prime Minister Harold Holt commented in The New York Times, \\"With 500,000 to 1 million Communist sympathizers knocked off, I think it is safe to assume a reorientation has taken place.\\" The right-wing oilman H. L. Hunt proclaimed Indonesia the sole bright spot for the United States in the Cold War and called the ouster of Sukarno the \\"greatest victory for freedom since the last decisive battle of World War II.\\" Time described the suppression of the PKI as \\"The West's best news for years in Asia,\\"Samuel Totten, William Parsons, Israel Charny (1997).

Routledge; 1 edition. and praised Suharto's regime as \\"scrupulously constitutional.\\" \\"It was a triumph for Western propaganda,\\" Robert Challis, a BBC reporter in the area, later reflected. Many Western media reports repeated the Indonesian army's line by downplaying the army's responsibility for and the rational, organised nature of the mass killing. They emphasised the role of civilians instead, invoking the orientalist stereotype of Indonesians as primitive and violent. A New York Times journalist wrote an article titled \\"When a Nation Runs Amok\\" explaining that the killings were hardly surprising since they occurred in \\"violent Asia, where life is cheap.\\" In recalling the attitudes of US government officials regarding the killings, State Department intelligence officer Howard Federspiel said that \\"no one cared, as long as they were Communists, that they were being butchered.\\"Brad Simpson (Winter 2013).

Kennedy was one of the only prominent individuals to condemn the massacres. In January 1966 he said: \\"We have spoken out against the inhuman slaughters perpetrated by the Nazis and the Communists. But will we speak out also against the inhuman slaughter in Indonesia, where over 100,000 alleged Communists have not been perpetrators, but victims?\\"Bellamy, Alex J. (2012). Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity. Oxford University Press. . p. 211. USSR's Andrei Sakharov called the killings a 'tragic event' and described it as \\"an extreme case of reaction, racism and militarism\\", but otherwise the Soviet response was relatively muted. It was likely in response to the PKI siding with China in the Sino- Soviet split. Other Communist states issued sharp criticism of the killings. The Chinese government stated they were \\"heinous and diabolical crimes ... unprecedented in history.\\" China also offered refuge to Indonesian leftists fleeing the violence. One Yugoslav diplomat commented that \\"even assuming the guilt of the politburo [PKI leadership], which I do not, does this justify genocide? Kill the Central Committee, but do not kill 100,000 people who do not know and had no part in it [the 30 September Plot].\\" The Suharto government was condemned as a \\"military fascist regime\\" by the government of North Korea. The United Nations avoided commenting on the killings. When Suharto returned Indonesia to the UN, communist Albania was the only member state to protest.  Foreign involvement  While the exact role of the United States government during the massacres remains obscured by still-sealed government archives on Indonesia for this period, it is known that \\"at a minimum,\\" the US government supplied money and communications equipment to the Indonesian Army that facilitated the mass killings, gave fifty million rupiah to the KAP-Gestapu death squad, and provided targeted names of thousands of alleged PKI leaders to the Indonesian Army. Robert J. Martens, political officer at the US Embassy in Jakarta from 1963 to 1966, told journalist Kathy Kadane in 1990 that he led a group of State Department and CIA officials who drew up the lists of roughly 5,000 Communist Party operatives, which he provided to an army intermediary. Kadane asserts that approval for the release of names came from top U.S. Embassy officials, including US Ambassador to Indonesia Marshall Green, deputy chief of mission Jack Lydman and political section chief Edward Masters, who all later denied involvement. Martens claimed he acted without approval to avoid red tape at a critical time. The State Department volume Foreign Relations of the United States, 1964‚Äì1968, which the CIA attempted to suppress in 2001, acknowledges that the U.S. Embassy provided lists of communist leaders to Indonesians involved in the purges, and notes that Marshall Green stated in a 1966 airgram to Washington, which was drafted by Martens and approved by Masters, that the lists of communists were \\"apparently being used by Indonesian security authorities who seem to lack even the simplest overt information on PKI leadership.\\" Scholars have also corroborated the claim that U.S. Embassy officials provided lists of communists to Suharto's forces, who, according to Mark Aarons, \\"ensured that those so named were eliminated in the mass killing operations.\\"Bellamy, J. (2012). Massacres and Morality: Mass Atrocities in an Age of Civilian Immunity. Oxford University Press. . p. 210. Geoffrey B. Robinson, professor of history at UCLA, asserts that U.S. government officials, among them Marshall Green, \\"published memoirs and articles that sought to divert attention from any possible US role, while questioning the integrity and political loyalties of scholars who disagreed with them.\\" Robert Cribb, writing in 2002, claims \\"there is considerable evidence that the U.S. encouraged the killings, by both providing funds to anti-communist forces and supplying the Indonesian army with the names of people whom it believed were PKI members. There is no evidence, however, that U.S. intervention significantly increased the scale of the killings.\\"Cribb, Robert, 2002, \\"Unresolved Problems in the Indonesian Killings of 1965‚Äì1966\\" Asian Survey, 42 (4): 552.

Robinson posits that, based on documentary evidence, powerful foreign states, in particular the United States, Great Britain and their allies, were instrumental in facilitating and encouraging the Indonesian army's campaign of mass killing, and without such support, the killings would not have happened. He elaborates in his 2018 book The Killing Season: Western support for the Indonesian Army solidified as it demonstrated its \\"resolve\\" through the mass killing campaigns. US President Lyndon B. Johnson's Security Advisor McGeorge Bundy reported to the president that the events since 1 October had been \\"a striking vindication of US policy towards Indonesia in recent years: a policy of keeping our hand in the game for the long-term stakes despite recurrent pressure to pull out\\" and that it was made clear to the Indonesian army via US Embassy's deputy chief of mission, Francis Joseph Galbraith, that \\"Embassy and the USG generally sympathetic with and admiring of what Army doing.\\" The United States, along with Great Britain and Australia, also played an active role in \\"black propaganda operations\\" during the killings, which included clandestine radio broadcasts being transmitted into the country that repeated Indonesian Army propaganda as part of a psychological warfare campaign designed to encourage support for the killings and to discredit the PKI. Of all countries, Swedish arms supplies seem to have been the most substantial. According to a report by an Indonesian refugee in Japan, from early December 1965, Indonesia signed \\"a contract with Sweden for an emergency purchase of $10,000,000 worth of small arms and ammunition to be used for annihilating elements of the PKI.\\" The Swedish Embassy's concerns about the slaughter did grow some months later, with Sweden's ambassador openly critical of the campaign of violence, but apparently after the fact. Documentary filmmaker Joshua Oppenheimer, director of The Act of Killing (2012) and The Look of Silence (2014), called on the U.S. to account for its role in the killings during a screening of the former for U.S. Congress members.Sabarini, Prodita (16 February 2014).

On 10 December 2014, the same day The Look of Silence was released in Indonesia, Senator Tom Udall (D-NM) introduced a \\"Sense of the Senate Resolution\\" which condemned the killings and called for the declassification of all documents pertaining to US involvement in the events, noting that \\"the U.S. provided financial and military assistance during this time and later, according to documents released by the State Department.\\"\\"The Look of Silence\\": Will New Film Force U.S. to Acknowledge Role in 1965 Indonesian Genocide?

Declassified documents released by the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta in October 2017 show that the U.S. government had detailed knowledge of the massacres from the start and specifically refer to mass killings ordered by Suharto. The documents also reveal that the U.S. government actively encouraged and facilitated the Indonesian Army's massacres to further its geopolitical interests in the region and that U.S. officials and diplomats at the embassy kept detailed records of which PKI leaders were being killed. US officials, dismayed at Indonesia's shift towards the left, were \\"ecstatic\\" over the seizure of power by right-wing generals who proceeded to exterminate the PKI, and were determined to avoid doing anything that might thwart the efforts of the Indonesian Army. The U.S. also withheld credible information which contradicted the Indonesian Army's version of events regarding the abortive coup by junior officers on 30 September 1965, which triggered the killings. On 21 December 1965, the Embassy's first secretary, Mary Vance Trent, sent a cable to the State Department which provided an estimate of 100,000 people killed, and referred to the events as a \\"fantastic switch which has occurred over 10 short weeks.\\" Bradley Simpson said these previously secret cables, telegrams, letters, and reports \\"contain damning details that the US was willfully and gleefully pushing for the mass murder of innocent people.\\"  Legacy  = Historiography = Discussion of the killings was heavily tabooed in Indonesia and, if mentioned at all, usually called peristiwa enam lima, the incident of '65.Zurbuchen, Mary S. (July/August 2002). \\"History, Memory, and the '1965 Incident' in Indonesia\\". Asian Survey Vol. 42, No. 4, pp. 564‚Äì581. Inside and outside Indonesia, public discussion of the killings increased during the 1990s and especially after 1998 when the New Order government collapsed. Jailed and exiled members of the Sukarno regime, as well as ordinary people, told their stories in increasing numbers. Foreign researchers felt more empowered to publish on the topic, with the end of intimidation by the military regime.Friend (2003), p. 115; ; Vickers (1995). The killings are skipped over in most Indonesian histories and have received little introspection by Indonesians as well as comparatively little international attention.Schwarz (1994), p. 21; Cribb (1990), pp. 2‚Äì3; Indonesian academics fight burning of books on 1965 coup, The Sydney Morning Herald, 9 August 2007. Indonesian textbooks typically depict the killings as a \\"patriotic campaign\\" that resulted in less than 80,000 deaths. In 2004, the textbooks were briefly changed to include the events, but this new curriculum discontinued in 2006 following protests from the military and Islamic groups. The textbooks which mentioned the mass killings were subsequently burnt, by order of Indonesia's Attorney General.Teaching and Remembering Inside Indonesia History Textbooks Suharto Era Transitional Justice . People.uncw.edu. Retrieved 25 December 2010. John Roosa's Pretext for Mass Murder (2006) was initially banned by the Attorney General's Office. The Indonesian parliament set up a truth and reconciliation commission to analyse the killings, but it was suspended by the Indonesian High Court. An academic conference regarding the killings was held in Singapore in 2009.Indonesia unwilling to tackle legacy of massacres, The Sydney Morning Herald. 13 June 2009 A hesitant search for mass graves by survivors and family members began after 1998, although little has been found. Over three decades later, great enmity remains in Indonesian society over the events. The Supardjo Document is a copy of the personal notes of General Supardjo regarding the 30 September Movement. It is one of the few primary sources of this event and gives insight into the movement from a military perspective, including Supardjo's opinion on what may have caused the movement to fail. Satisfactory explanations for the scale and frenzy of the violence have challenged scholars from all ideological perspectives. One view attributes the communal hatreds behind the killings to the forcing of parliamentary democracy onto Indonesian society, claiming that such changes were culturally unsuitable and unnecessarily disruptive in the post-independence 1950s. A contrasting view is that when Sukarno and the military replaced the democratic process with authoritarianism, competing interests‚Äîi.e., the army, political Islam, and Communism‚Äîcould not be openly debated. They were suppressed instead and could only be expressed through violence. Conflict resolution methods have broken down, and Muslim groups and the military adopted an \\"us or them attitude\\", and that when the killings were over, many Indonesians dismissed as something the Communists had deserved. The possibility of a return to similar upheavals is cited as a factor in the \\"New Order\\" administration's political conservatism and tight control of the political system. Vigilance against a Communist threat remained a hallmark of Suharto's three-decade presidency.Friend (2003), p. 114. Although mostly unknown in the West compared to the Vietnam War and various right-wing coups in Latin America, the massacres and Suharto's rise to power are considered by historians to be a significant turning point in the Cold War. The massacres were also crucial to the expansion of capitalism in Indonesia, with Suharto rapidly implementing the economic policies of the \\"Berkeley Mafia\\", whose training had been funded by the Ford Foundation, to liberalise the economy. Given US foreign policy goals of stopping the spread of communism and bringing nations into its sphere of influence, the bloody purge which decimated the PKI, the third-largest Communist Party in the world at the time, was considered a huge victory. After viewing declassified documents released in 2017, historian John Roosa notes that much \\"of the U.S. foreign policy establishment viewed it as a great victory that they were able to sort of 'flip' Indonesia very quickly.\\" He also asserts that the US did not simply \\"stand by\\" and allow the killings to happen, stating \\"it's easy for American commentators to fall into that approach, but the U.S. was part and parcel of the operation, strategizing with the Indonesian army and encouraging them to go after the PKI.\\" Geoffrey B. Robinson asserts that while there is no consensus on the matter, some scholars have described the mass killings as a genocide. Jess Melvin claims the 1965‚Äì66 massacre constitutes genocide under the legal definition as particular religious and ethnic groups were targeted collectively for their relations to the PKI. She cites Matthew Lippman and David Nersessian stating atheists are covered under the genocide convention and argues the Indonesian military prescribed the elimination of \\"atheists\\" and \\"unbelievers\\" collectively for their association with communism and the PKI, and thus these killings would constitute genocide. Melvin also emphasises the extermination of the PKI as an act of genocide by pointing out that the PKI themselves identified with a particular religious denomination known as \\"Red Islam\\" that mixed Islam with communism. She further argues the killings constitute genocide because the PKI constitute an ideologically based \\"national group.\\" = International People's Tribunal 1965 = In November 2015, the International People's Tribunal on 1965 Crimes Against Humanity in Indonesia, presided over by seven international judges, was held in The Hague, Netherlands. It was formally established in 2014 by human rights activists, academics, and Indonesian exiles in response to an \\"absence of an official domestic process of transitional justice based on truth finding.\\" In July 2016, chief judge Zak Yacoob publicly read the tribunal's findings, which called the state of Indonesia directly responsible for the events and guilty of crimes against humanity, blamed Suharto for spreading false propaganda and laying the grounds for the massacres, and concluded that the massacres \\"intended to annihilate a section of the population and could be categorised as genocide\\". The report also highlighted other allegations which the panel found to be well-founded, including enslavement in labour camps, ruthless torture, systematic sexual violence and forced disappearance. Indonesia rejected the tribunal's ruling; Security Minister Luhut Panjaitan said the killings were \\"none of their business, they are not our superiors and Indonesia has its own system.\\" The court has no legal authority to issue binding decisions or rulings. Judge Yacoob stated that \\"the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Australia were all complicit to differing degrees in the commission of these crimes against humanity.\\" The judges conclude that the US supported the Indonesian military \\"knowing well that they were embarked upon a programme of mass killings,\\" which included providing lists of alleged communist party officials to the Indonesian security forces with a \\"strong presumption that these would facilitate the arrest and/or the execution of those that were named\\", whereas the UK and Australia repeated false propaganda from the Indonesian Army, even after it became \\"abundantly clear that killings and other crimes against humanity were taking place.\\" Australia's foreign affairs ministry rejected the conclusion of the tribunal, which it described as a \\"human rights NGO\\", and denies the country was in any way complicit in the killings. The US and the UK have not responded to the tribunal's findings. Indonesian human-rights lawyer Nursyahbani Katjasungkana(Indonesian) called on all three countries to admit their complicity, stating that it had been proved from their various diplomatic communications and could no longer be denied. = Films and documentaries = During Suharto's regime, the media was heavily influenced and censored to show a 'certain' history of the 1965 incident: a history which purely and undoubtedly blamed the PKI for this political tragedy. However, in recent articles such as by 'The Jakarta Post', a more in-depth and complex story is recognised by the media offering conflicting views on whom the blame should really fall. A film supporting the New Order's version of events, Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI (Betrayal of Indonesia Communist Party) was broadcast annually on the government television station TVRI every 30 September. This version was the only one allowed in open discourse in the country. After Suharto's removal from power, many people, including those involved, told other versions of the events in various books and films. One, the documentary film The Act of Killing, included interviews with individuals who had participated in the mass killings, and its companion piece The Look of Silence follows one grieving family trying to understand why it happened and exposes how those behind the massacres still revel in their crimes 50 years on, including boasting on camera how they dismembered, eviscerated, castrated and beheaded alleged communists.Michael Atkinson (16 July 2015). A Quiet Return to the Killing Fields of Indonesia. In These Times. Retrieved 16 July 2015. The film The Year of Living Dangerously, based around events leading up to the killings, internationally released in 1982, was banned in Indonesia until 2000. = Books and novels = The killings inspired many novelists to write their own rendition of the event, either on a more local, socio-cultural level, or on a national, political level. Books that were written in Indonesia during the time of the New Order often faced censorship of certain concepts, while books written and published abroad were banned from the country. John Roosa's Pretext for Mass Murder traces a historical path through the 1965 event, painting a scenario of explanations for what preceded, caused and followed the coup. It focuses on several aspects of the coup such as the incoherence of facts and the incompetence of coup organisers to provide four main interpretations of the coup:(1) the movement as an attempted coup d'√©tat by the PKI, (2) the movement as a mutiny of junior officers, (3) the movement as an alliance of army officers and the PKI, and (4) the movement as a frame- up of the PKI. It also looks at material previously left unexplored in traditional discussions of the incident to give a reconstruction of the chaos that surrounds this period in Indonesian history. Ahmad Tohari's trilogy novel The Dancer (Ronggeng Dukuh Paruk) depicts a village community caught in a revolution, giving readers a perspective less acknowledged in the more popular account of the massacres. By having its two main characters, Srintil and Rasus, on opposite ends of the revolution, the novel sketches not only the circumstances that could have drawn the greater rural public into communist practices but also the mindset of the people who were tasked with carrying out the killings. As the novel was published in 1981, certain aspects were censored by the New Order, but all the same, the trilogy provides valuable insight into the grass-root level of the anti-communist coup and the tragedies that followed. Eka Kurniawan's Beauty is a Wound (2002) weaves history into satire, tragedy and the supernatural to depict the state of the nation before, during and after 1965. There is less focus on the military aspect of the coup, but a good deal of focus on the communists themselves through the form of interpersonal relationships and communist ghosts who could not find peace. Without meaning to, perhaps, the novel also gives readers a glimpse of the economy of Indonesia at the time using the example of a flourishing prostitute business and a temporary swimsuit business, among others. Kurniawan projects his feelings about the revolution and coup by constructing a story of theatrical characters around it and delivers a history of the nation all the way from Dutch occupation to Suharto. Louise Doughty Black Water (2016) deals with the 1965 event by exploring them from a European viewpoint. Shifting between California and Indonesia as settings for the novel, the book is written from the perspective of a single man working as an operative for an international company. The novel focuses more on foreign reactions to the coup rather than the coup itself, especially from the foreign journalist community.

He was a brother to historian Franz Boll (1805‚Äì1875), with whom he worked on numerous projects. Ernst Boll is remembered for his extensive research involving the natural history of Mecklenburg. He studied theology and sciences in Bonn and Berlin, and following graduation in 1842, became a private tutor in the town of Friedland. In 1846 he was a founding member of Vereins der Freunde der Naturgeschichte Mecklenburg (Association of Friends of Natural History of Mecklenburg), and he was editor of the group's archives from 1847 until his death in 1868. In this position he penned many scientific articles on geology, petrography, zoology and botany.

It usually consists of pork shoulder that is boiled in spices and thinly sliced. The meat is served with side dishes such as spicy radish salad, sliced raw garlic, ssamjang (wrap sauce), saeu-jeot (salted shrimp), kimchi, and ssam (wrap) vegetables such as lettuce, kkaennip (perilla leaves), and inner leaves of a napa cabbage. Bossam is a popular dish in South Korea, often served as anju (i.e. food accompanying alcoholic drinks). To eat, the meat and side dishes are wrapped together in ssam vegetables, hence the literal meaning of bossam: \\"wrapped\\" or \\"packaged\\".  History  Bossam is traditionally linked with the process of gimjang, during which large quantities of kimchi are prepared for winters. To ensure the commitment of the workers during this labor-intensive process, yangban (scholar-gentry of the Joseon era) would deliver a pig for a feast. The workers would enjoy boiled pork with some of their newly made kimchi, which, being early in the fermentation process, was a fresh and crispy complement to the soft pork of bossam.  Preparation  Although beef can also be used, pork is preferred for bossam. Pork shoulder is the most commonly used cut, but fattier cuts such as pork belly and chewier cuts such as pork hand can also be used. The meat is tied with kitchen twine to hold its shape, and boiled in a broth that contains star anise, ginger, white part and root of scallion, garlic, doenjang (soybean paste), coffee powder, tea leaves, and so on, to reduce the gaminess. When cooked, it is rinsed with cold water, untied, and pressed lightly in a cotton cloth to maintain its shape. When cooled, the meat is sliced into pieces of about and served with varieties of side dishes, typically including spicy radish salad similar to the kimchi filling, inner leaves of napa cabbages, and freshly made baechu-kimchi (napa cabbage kimchi). If the meat is served with fresh raw oyster, the dish is called gul-bossam (; \\"oyster bossam\\").

Other oil fields are shown in gray. The Mount Poso Oil Field is a large oil and gas field in the lower foothills of the Sierra Nevada in Kern County, California, United States. Discovered in 1926, and relatively close to exhaustion with less than three percent of its original oil remaining, it is the 21st largest field in California by total ultimate oil recovery, having a cumulative production of close to .California Department of Conservation, Oil and Gas Statistics, Annual Report, December 31, 2006, p. 67 The current principal operator of the field is Plains Exploration & Production; 652 wells remained active at the end of 2006, while production had dwindled to during that year, from a peak of over in 1981.DOGGR, p. 294 Setting The oil field is in the lower Sierra Foothills, north and northeast of the city of Bakersfield, and directly north of the giant Kern River Oil Field. To the west is the large agricultural region of the San Joaquin Valley. Vegetation on the hills around the oil field is mostly grassland. The field is about long and across, although some of the productive areas are widely separated, and even within the four named areas the pools are often discontiguous. Elevations on the field range from around at the southern boundary along Poso Creek to over in the northeastern portion; the central area of operations, around Halfway House, is approximately above sea level. Access to the field is by several roads. Famoso Woody Road enters the field from the west, from its junction with California State Route 65 in the San Joaquin Valley bottom, and Granite Road crosses the field from south to north, also passing through the Kern Front field. Other oil fields nearby, in addition the Kern River field, are the Poso Creek Oil Field to the southwest, adjacent to the San Joaquin Valley bottomland, and the Kern Front Oil Field, which is between the Poso Creek field and the Kern River field; all three of these nearby fields are in the lowest portion of the foothills as they begin to rise from the valley floor. To the southeast of Mount Poso is the Round Mountain Oil Field. The climate is semi-arid, with long, hot summers and cool winters. Most precipitation falls in the winter, in the form of rain, with the amount increasing with elevation. Summertime temperatures regularly exceed . Geology The Mount Poso Oil Field is a complex agglomeration of petroleum pools in structural and stratigraphic traps, and divided into six general areas, all of which are cut by faults, and many of which are discontiguous even within named areas. From north to south, the areas are: Dominion, the second-largest, at ; Granite Canyon (); the Main Area, the largest, at ; West (); Dorsey Area (); and the Baker-Grover Area (). All six areas include wells in the Vedder Formation, of Oligocene age, while the Dominion and Main Areas also include wells in the more recently discovered Freeman-Jewett Formation, of Miocene age. Source rocks are well-sorted medium grain marine sandstones of high porosity (around 35%).R.B. Block, \\"Ramp-style deposition of Oligocene Marine Vedder formation, San Joaquin Valley, California,\\" Bulletin of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, April 1986 The oil field is shallow, compared to other Central Valley fields, as the basement rocks are only about below ground surface. The deepest well only goes to , reaching the Freeman Formation, of Eocene age. Underneath the oil-bearing sedimentary formations, the basement granitic complex is of Jurassic age. It rises towards the east, part of the enormous Sierra Nevada Batholith. Oil from the field is heavy crude, and consistent between the different areas, ranging from API gravity of 13 to 16. Sulfur content is also consistent at approximately 0.65 percent by weight throughout the different pools.DOGGR, pp. 294-300 History, production, and operations The Mount Poso Oil Field was discovered in 1926, during an era in which many of the large California oil fields were found, especially those adjacent to the previous large discoveries which had taken place in the preceding three decades. Shell Oil acquired the field in the 1960s, intending to subject the entire area to steam flooding, a technology which was then new, and producing impressive yields elsewhere in heavy oil fields in California, such as the Midway-Sunset and Kern River fields. In 1969, production from the field was a mere of oil per day; however, by the 1980s, Shell had increased production to of oil per day, attaining a total of over in 1981, the highest yield ever achieved from the field, and making the field the 8th-most productive in the state.B.

In 1999, as the field appeared to be played out, they sold it to Nuevo Energy, the predecessor of Plains Exploration & Production (PXP).

The dam, on private property, is on the Cimarron River, and is responsible for Eagle Nest Lake. History In 1907, two wealthy ranchers, Frank Springer and Charles Springer, and the Cimarron Valley Land Company were granted a water permit to impound the water of the Cimarron River for irrigation by building a dam. Construction of the dam began in 1916, and continued until 1918. The dam is high and has an arc length of . At the top, the dam is wide, and it is wide at the base. It is considered the largest privately built dam in the United States. The resulting lake, known as Eagle Nest Lake has an area of and measures long, and wide. The surface elevation of the water when the lake is at capacity is above sea level. The reservoir has a capacity of of water. The dam was constructed by laborers from the Taos Pueblo. It is named Eagle Nest Dam for the eagles that made themselves a home on the sides of the dam. The dam sits between two granite walls, and as part of the plans, the Springers had to reroute U.S. Route 64 to its current location, over McAvoy Hill. Water rights To help finance the dam, Springer sold some water rights from Eagle Nest Lake to local farmers and ranchers. These original rights are known as vested rights. In 1951, the State of New Mexico adjudicated the watershed of the Cimarron River. This adjudication confirmed Springer's original permit which gave him the right to store surplus and flood water in the Eagle Nest Lake. There were many other court cases, and one of them ended up in the New Mexico State Supreme Court in 1990. Today, Eagle Nest Lake still serves its intended purpose as a reservoir, which provides irrigation water via the Cimarron River and a complex canal system, to many farmers and ranchers, some as far as 50 miles downstream. Some of the water rights from Eagle Nest Lake have been purchased by local municipalities including Raton and Springer. The villages of Angel Fire, Eagle Nest, and Cimarron can also get their water from the lake. State ownership In 2002, the State of New Mexico bought the lake, and it is now operated by the New Mexico Interstate Stream Commission (ISC), but owners maintained their water rights. After New Mexico bought the lake, various water users approached Governor Bill Richardson in hopes of mediation to end the litigation over water rights. Governor Richardson and the local governing bodies signed the Eagle Nest Water Rights Settlement on June 2, 2006. This settlement specifies that all users share in water shortages. The sharing arrangement is prorated based on the amount of water in the lake on June 1 of each year. All users will be treated equally, including the so-called Tier-Two users who make bulk water purchases. The agreement can be viewed on the web. The state established the Eagle Nest Lake State Park for use of the lake for recreational purposes.

Union Triad The Union Triad is a group of the three oldest existing Greek-letter social fraternities in North America that were founded at Union College in Schenectady, New York: the Kappa Alpha Society (established 1825), the Sigma Phi Society (1827) and the Delta Phi (1827). No formal organization exists. Other fraternities which owe their birth to Union College include Psi Upsilon (1833), Chi Psi (1841) and Theta Delta Chi (1847). Collectively, these many foundings earned Union College the title Mother of Fraternities. Miami Triad The Miami Triad refers to three fraternities founded at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio in the 19th century: Beta Theta Pi (1839), Phi Delta Theta (1848), and Sigma Chi (1855). Historians of fraternities often compare the significance of the Miami Triad to that of the earlier Union Triad.The History of College Fraternities Retrieved April 18, 2012.Complete History of the Fraternal Values Society Retrieved April 18, 2012. Delta Zeta sorority was founded at Miami University in 1902, and Phi Kappa Tau fraternity in 1906. Delta Sigma Epsilon sorority began there in 1914, merging in 1956 with Delta Zeta. These numerous Greek organization foundings cause some to refer to the school also as the Mother of Fraternities.Miami University--Oxford U.S. News & World Report It has been tradition at some campuses that have chapters of each of the Miami Triad, such as the University of Kansas, and the University of Mississippi, to hold an annual party, formal, or ball, often referred to as \\"Miami Triad\\" or simply \\"Triad\\", to commemorate their tie to each other and the Miami Triad's place in Greek history. This tradition has waned in recent years and some schools have transformed the celebration into new events, such as the University of Kansas' Miami Triad Concert. Lexington Triad A monument in Lexington honors the members of its Triad The Lexington Triad is a group of three fraternities founded by students from colleges in Lexington, Virginia during Reconstruction following the American Civil War. Members of the triad include Alpha Tau Omega (founded in Richmond, Virginia in 1865 by students from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington), Kappa Alpha Order (founded in 1865 at Washington and Lee University and not to be confused with the Kappa Alpha Society), and Sigma Nu (founded in 1869 at VMI). The national headquarters of both the Kappa Alpha Order and Sigma Nu are located in Lexington. The members of the Triad are sometimes also grouped as part of the Virginia Circle, which includes several other fraternities founded in Virginia roughly during the period of the Lexington Triad: Kappa Sigma and Pi Kappa Alpha at the University of Virginia, and sometimes Sigma Phi Epsilon at Richmond College. Jefferson Duo and Pennsylvania Triad The Jefferson Duo includes the fraternities Phi Gamma Delta and Phi Kappa Psi, founded in 1848 and 1852, respectively, at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. A third, Kappa Phi Lambda, was also founded there but dissolved in 1874. In 1865, Jefferson College combined with Washington College to become Washington & Jefferson College.

He was a member of the satirical Cabaret Cornichon and starred in movies by directors such as Leopold Lindtberg, Franz Schnyder, and Kurt Fr√ºh. He was the younger brother of the artist and illustrator Alois Carigiet. Balthasar Anton Carigiet was one of eleven children born to Alois Carigiet and Barbara Antonia Carigiet, n√©e Lombriser. His father was a farmer in Trun in the canton of Grisons, and had served as magistrate in the district of Disentis. Economic hardship forced the family to resettle in the canton's capital Chur in 1911, where Zarli visited the primary and secondary school, and absolved an apprenticeship with decorative artist Walter R√§th. Zarli's older brother Alois had also been trained in R√§th's atelier. In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Zarli worked as a graphic designer for his brother's atelier in Zurich. Carigiet's comical talent was discovered by Walter Lesch, a comedy writer and the artistic director of the satirical \\"Cabaret Cornichon\\" (\\"Gherkin Cabaret\\"). Carigiet joined the Cornichon 's ensemble in 1934 and remained a steady member until 1951. Carigiet often played the part of a likeable social outcast, such as a former convict on parole in Leopold Lindtberg's cinematic adaptation of Friedrich Glauser's detective story Wachtmeister Studer (Constable Studer, 1939), a poet and psychiatric patient in Matto regiert (Madness Rules, 1947) by the same director and author, or a homeless person in Kurt Fr√ºh's Hinter den sieben Gleisen (\\"Behind the Seven Tracks\\", 1959) He also performed in blackface: as an \\"Abyssinian\\" in a political Cornichon sketch on Ethiopia in 1935, or as \\"Hassan the Moor\\" in Lindtberg's film adaptation of Conrad Ferdinand Meyer's Der Schuss von der Kanzel (\\"The Shot from the Pulpit\\" 1942).

VampireFreaks was launched as a social networking site in 1999 and added an online clothing store in 2001. The social network element was removed in February 2020.  Online Clothing Store  The VampireFreaks online clothing store has steadily grown since its inception in 2001, currently featuring thousands of products. It started as an offshoot of the popular VampireFreaks social networking site and is currently the primary focus of the VampireFreaks brand. Clothing styles featured include gothic, punk rock, emo, metal, steampunk, kawaii, rockabilly. VampireFreaks is an official distributor of brands such as Tripp NYC, Killstar, Kreepsville 666, Sourpuss, Dark In Love, Punk Rave, Demonia, Devil Fashion, and Alchemy. In addition to selling other brands, VampireFreaks sells its own custom branded items such as t-shirts, hoodies, bracelets, leggings, messenger bags, and tote bags with original VampireFreaks artwork. Online store features include frequently updated sales, a 'wishlist', a 'top sellers' section, clearance section, and a rewards program. The rewards program allows users to accrue points with each purchase in order to get future discounts and free items. Customers can also refer a friend to get additional rewards. VampireFreaks promotes their online store through their social media and their email newsletters.  Social Networking site  VampireFreaks was previously a social networking site, created by site owner Jet Berelson in 1999. It began with a small number of forums dedicated to Gothic‚Äìindustrial music. Over the years it grew to be a large social network, with thousands of members. Website features included user groups which were called 'cults' and allowed users to create their own communities (forums) within the website. The website also had event pages, music interviews, models, and frequent design contests. It also featured a popular message-board which is a major component of the site's success. The site‚Äôs main topic of focus, aside from socializing, was the music content users create. Berelson regularly updated the site with information concerning not only bands, but various alternative events. Many people have found love on the site, and this has been focused on during Valentine's Day, where couples that met through the site submitted stories of how they met their matches. \\"Premium Memberships\\" were also offered (for a fee), these feature the ability to upload more pictures, see who views the user's profile, and \\"powerbomb\\" the \\"unwanted\\" VF members. On June 17th, 2019, Berelson announced that he would shut down the website in February 2020, wanting to focus more on the VampireFreaks online store, real life and Dark Side of the Con, an alternative gathering organized by the company. It was shut down on February 1st, 2020.  Physical Clothing store  VampireFreaks had a clothing store, named after the site, located in New York City. The store sold similar products to the current website, and was also a social gathering place. The store hosted meet-and-greets for popular gothic-industrial bands including The Birthday Massacre, Aesthetic Perfection, and Faderhead. It closed in 2011 after over three years of operation.  Events  VampireFreaks hosts a wide number of events, mainly in the New York City area. Some of the most popular of these events include 'Cybertron', a gothic-industrial clubnight in NYC, 'The Black Parade', an emo / pop-punk club night in Brooklyn, and the 'Triton Festival', a music festival that has attracted gothic-industrial bands from around the world. VampireFreaks' largest event is 'Dark Side Of The Con', which is a 3-day dark alternative convention held in New Jersey. Dark Side of the Con has rapidly grown since 2017, attracting attendees from around the world, and is advertised as North America's largest gothic convention / festival. Dark Side of the Con 4 in March 2020 was forced to reschedule to September 2020 due to quarantine from novel coronavirus in the Tri-state area.  Controversy  The now defunct VampireFreaks Social Network, much like other social network sites MySpace and Facebook, has been potentially linked to several crimes: * Kimveer Gill, the perpetrator of the Dawson College Shooting, maintained an account on the website. * A triple homicide in Medicine Hat, Alberta, Canada. In 2005, a 12-year-old girl and her 23-year-old predator, whom she communicated with on VampireFreaks.com, were charged in the murders.Hate-Filled VampireFreaks website linked to several crimes, from The Vancouver Sun * Two Toronto men were charged with carrying out the bidding of a woman they met on the site by stabbing a 12-year-old boy 73 times, killing him, and drinking his blood * The site has been linked to a church arson in Manitoba and the rape of two underage women in New York City and Texas. * In Australia, in 2007, a 47-year-old man and his 17-year-old son from Victoria were accused of using VampireFreaks.com to create fictitious characters to meet under-aged women. On January 21, 2010, the man was found guilty of the murder of Carly Ryan, a schoolgirl he had groomed via MySpace. * In December 2007, in California, a 13-year-old girl posing as an adult met with a 23-year- old man on VampireFreaks.com. When it was found out they met in real life, he was arrested and found with photos of them kissing. The jury had reasonable doubt however, and the man was found not guilty on two of the charges. Berelson has responded to some of this controversy, saying that the website does not influence its users to commit crimes and that \\"The goth scene is a very friendly, nurturing, non-violent community and we are very supportive of our users and do not condone any illegal activities\\".Angel of death's web warnings, from The Sydney Morning Herald  References   External links  * Category:Blog hosting services Category:American social networking websites Category:Internet properties established in 1999 Category:Goth subculture Category:1999 establishments in the United States ","title":"Vampirefreaks.com"},{"id":"18171094","text":"Shenzhen Universiade Sports Centre (), also known as Shenzhen Universiade Centre, Longgang Universiade Sports Centre, or Longgang Stadium, is a multi- use sport facilities complex in Longgang, Shenzhen, Guangdong, China.

At issue was control of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, then the largest state in Europe. Jogaila had been crowned King of Poland in 1386; he installed his brother Skirgaila as ruler of Lithuania. Skirgaila proved unpopular and Vytautas attempted to depose him. When his first attempt to take the capital city of Vilnius failed, Vytautas forged an alliance with the Teutonic Knights, their common enemy ‚Äì just as both cousins had done during the Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384. Vytautas and the Knights unsuccessfully besieged Vilnius in 1390. Over the next two years it became clear that neither side could achieve a quick victory, and Jogaila proposed a compromise: Vytautas would become Grand Duke and Jogaila would remain Superior Duke. This proposal was formalized in the Ostr√≥w Agreement of 1392, and Vytautas turned against the Knights. He went on to reign as Grand Duke of Lithuania for 38 years, and the cousins remained at peace. Background The family of Gediminas ruled a state that covered the territories of present-day Lithuania, Belarus, Ukraine, Transnistria, and parts of Poland and Russia. Gediminas died in 1341; afterwards his sons Algirdas and Kƒôstutis, the fathers of Jogaila and Vytautas, co-ruled the Grand Duchy peacefully. However, after Algirdas' death in 1377, Kƒôstutis, Jogaila, and Vytautas began a power struggle. During their first conflict, the Lithuanian Civil War between 1381 and 1384, Vytautas and Jogaila both struck short-lived alliances with the Teutonic Knights. Vytautas did not manage to seize the throne and reconciled with Jogaila in 1384. Jogaila created a significant new alliance with the Kingdom of Poland when he secured an agreement, known as the Union of Krewo (August 1385), to marry the twelve-year-old Queen of Poland Jadwiga of Poland. He married Jadwiga and was crowned jure uxoris king of Poland in February 1386. As a condition to the marriage and coronation, Jogaila agreed to renounce paganism himself and Christianize his subjects, and establish a personal union between Poland and Lithuania. The Union was an unwelcome development for the Teutonic Knights, as it united Poland and Lithuania, two states hostile to the Order, and a Christianized Lithuania deprived the Knights of their ideological justification for waging the Lithuanian Crusade. Thus the Order sought opportunities to undo the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian union; they demanded Samogitia, a section of western Lithuania that bordered the Baltic Sea, and refused to recognize Jogaila's baptism in 1386. Vytautas became duke of Hrodna and Podlaskie; Jogaila known now by his Christian name W≈Çadys≈Çaw II (W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço) designated his brother Skirgaila regent in Lithuania. Skirgaila, who also ruled Vytautas' patrimony in Trakai, was disliked by the Lithuanian nobility. Vytautas, on the other hand, became increasingly popular; W≈Çadys≈Çaw II began to see him as a rival. Vytautas was supported by Lithuanians who resented the Polish interpretation of the recent Union of Krewo. These Lithuanians wished to maintain distinct legal structures and reserve official posts for Lithuanians. The Lithuanian elites also resented the changes in government that king W≈Çadys≈Çaw II implemented there. Civil war =1389‚Äì1390= Portrait of an English Knight, from the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales. The fictional knight took part in many crusades, including one against the Lithuanians. Jogaila had sent Klemens Moskarzewski to establish a Polish garrison in Vilnius and stabilize the situation, but this move only angered the opposition. In May 1389 Jogaila tried to mediate the conflict between Skirgaila and Vytautas in Lublin. Vytautas was pressured into signing a formal document declaring that he was loyal to Skirgaila and supported him, but his position as Duke of Lutsk was not formally acknowledged. Vytautas secured his position in Lutsk, and turned his sights on Vilnius. According to Teutonic testimony at the Council of Constance, Vytautas planned to take advantage of his sister's wedding by sending wagons filled with meat, hay, and other goods to Vilnius. The wagons would be escorted by armed men, who would capture the castle once inside the city. This plan was uncovered by a German spy and the conspirators were executed. In another setback, two of Vytautas' strongest allies, his brother Tautvilas and his brother-in-law Ivan Olshanski, lost their territories in Navahrudak and Halshany. Vytautas then sought a military alliance with the Knights, sending captive knight Marquard von Salzbach to negotiate. On 19 January 1390 in Lyck Vytautas signed the Treaty of Lyck affirming the terms of an earlier agreement, the Treaty of K√∂nigsberg, signed in 1384 during his first conflict with Jogaila. Under the terms of this treaty, the Knights were promised Samogitia, up to the Nevƒó≈æis River, in exchange for their military assistance. Having been earlier betrayed, the Knights asked for hostages as a guarantee of Vytautas' loyalty: his brothers Sigismund and Tautvilas, his wife Anna, his daughter Sophia, his sister Rymgajla, his favorite Ivan Olshanski, and a number of other nobles. Jogaila, later known as W≈Çadys≈Çaw II Jagie≈Ç≈Ço In May, a delegation of 31 Samogitian nobles arrived in K√∂nigsberg and promised loyalty to Vytautas by signing the Treaty of K√∂nigsberg. The joint forces of Vytautas and the Teutonic Knights consisted largely of volunteers and mercenaries from western Europe, notably from France, the German states, and England. Henry, Earl of Derby, the future King Henry IV of England and Marshal of France Jean Le Maingre were among the participants. The English crusaders left detailed records of their actions in Prussia and Lithuania, and their exploits were mentioned by Geoffrey Chaucer in the Canterbury Tales, possibly as a compliment to the English knights and the future king. In the meantime, Jogaila achieved some military successes; his forces captured several castles in Podlaskie, leaving them to be guarded by Polish garrisons, and took Hrodna in April 1390 after a six-week siege. The newly assembled coalition organized a number of small campaigns in Lithuania; the largest was undertaken at the end of summer. During this campaign the Knights burned wooden castles at Kernavƒó, possibly the first capital of Lithuania, which never recovered from the destruction. While the army was laying siege to Georgenburg, Grand Master Conrad Z√∂llner von Rothenstein died. The coalition decided to abandon this siege and march on Vilnius instead, as such a large army could not easily be re-assembled. On 11 September 1390, the joint forces launched a five-week siege on the city. Vilnius' castles were held by Skirgaila, commanding combined Polish, Lithuanian, and Ruthenian troops. The Knights reduced much of the outer city to ruins and managed to destroy the Crooked Castle, which was never rebuilt. Vytautas' brother Tautvilas Kƒôstutaitis and Jogaila's brother Karigaila died during the siege. The besiegers ran into various difficulties. Their supplies of gunpowder were dwindling, the weather was deteriorating, the terms of service for some volunteers from western Europe ended, and the Knights needed a new Grand Master. They decided to return to Prussia. The siege did not bring an end to the conflict, but it demonstrated an increased dissatisfaction with Jogaila among the regional inhabitants. =1391‚Äì1392= Vytautas the Great On 21 January 1391 Vytautas' only daughter, Sophia of Lithuania, married Vasili I of Russia, Grand Duke of Moscow. This alliance strengthened Vytautas' influence in Slavic lands and represented a potential new ally against Poland. At the same time, Jogaila's brother Lengvenis was losing his power in Veliky Novgorod to Moscow. The Teutonic Knights were idled during the protracted selection of their new Grand Master, Konrad von Wallenrode; their general chapter delayed his election. In May 1391, the new master mortgaged Z≈Çotoria (Slatoria), a castle near Thorn, from W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk, count palatine of Sigismund of Hungary, for 6,632 guldens. This angered Jogaila and he invaded Dobrzy≈Ñ Land, but was driven away. Von Wallenrode called for new volunteers from France, England, and Scotland. Among those who responded was William Douglas of Nithsdale. During the autumn of 1391 the Teutonic Knights organized another campaign against Vilnius. In Kaunas they organized a lavish feast, which was prominently featured in Konrad Wallenrod, an 1828 poem by Adam Mickiewicz. They devastated the nearby towns of Ukmergƒó and Mai≈°iagala, but lacked the resources for a second siege on Vilnius. In November 1391 Vytautas attacked the areas near Merkinƒó and Hrodna, cutting off the easiest communication route between Jogaila and Skirgaila. In the meantime the Knights were buying lands in Prussia. In May 1392, von Wallenrode began negotiations with Sigismund of Hungary to buy Neumark for 500,000 guldens. Negotiations fell apart as the title to the land was contested by several dukes. The Neumark purchase was closed with Jobst of Moravia only in 1402. During July 1392, the Knights agreed to pay W≈Çadys≈Çaw Opolczyk 50,000 guldens for the Dobrzy≈Ñ Land, which had been contested among Piast dukes since 1377. Opolczyk, the ruler of Opole in Silesia, had little interest in the volatile regions to his north. In 1392, he circulated a proposal to partition Poland among the Teutonic Knights, the Holy Roman Empire, Silesia, and Hungary, but it was rejected. These purchases by the Knights threatened Poland's northern borders. Neither Jogaila nor Vytautas had gained a clear advantage and the territories of the Grand Duchy affected by the civil war were being devastated. Polish nobles were dissatisfied with the war; Jogaila was spending a great deal of time on Lithuanian matters and the expected benefits of the Union of Krewo had not materialized. The Union was meant to strengthen Polish control over Galicia, Moldavia, and Wallachia rather than to create fresh troubles in the north. Jogaila was preoccupied with the management of his court, battles in the southeast, and his sickly wife. He attempted to replace Skirgaila with his younger brother Vygantas, but this brother died under unclear circumstances ‚Äì according to rumor he was poisoned by either Vytautas or Skirgaila. Klemens Moskarzewski was replaced with Jan Ole≈õnicki from Krak√≥w as governor of Vilnius. Jogaila decided to seek a compromise with Vytautas. Peace treaty In spring 1392, Jogaila proposed a compromise through his envoy, Henry of Masovia, Bishop of P≈Çock: Vytautas would become the Grand Duke of Lithuania if he would recognize Jogaila as the Supreme Duke. By summer, Vytautas had secured the release of many of the hostages he had given to the Knights, and accepted the offer. Since this agreement with Jogaila was reached in secret, the Knights suspected nothing when Vytautas invited them to the festivities at his headquarters, the Ritterswerder Castle on an island in the Neman River. Most of the prominent guests were taken prisoner and Vytautas' army proceeded to attack and destroy the undermanned wooden castles of Ritterswerder, Metenburg, and Neugarten (New Hrodna) near Hrodna. The Ostr√≥w Agreement, formalizing the arrangement and ending the civil war, was signed on 4 August 1392. Vytautas became Grand Duke and reclaimed his patrimony in Trakai while Skirgaila was compensated with the Principality of Kiev, where he died in 1397. While Vytautas was technically a vassal of Jogaila, he exercised considerable power in the Grand Duchy. His independence was legalized in the 1401 Union of Vilnius and Radom. Vytautas ruled Lithuania until his death in 1430; his relationship with Jogaila during these years is sometimes likened to the peaceful power-sharing demonstrated by their fathers Algirdas and Kƒôstutis. The Knights, betrayed for the second time, resumed their wars against Lithuania. They sought to take Samogitia, which Vytautas had twice promised them. The Treaty of Salynas was signed in 1398, leaving Samogitia to the Knights, to quiet the Duchy's western front while Vytautas was organizing a major campaign against the Golden Horde. Vytautas suffered a major defeat at the Battle of the Vorskla River in 1399. The cousins joined their forces at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, which ended the threat from the Teutonic Orders.

He served as the Executive Secretary of the Administrative Tribunal of the Inter-American Development Bank in Washington, DC from late 1987 until his retirement from the Bank in 2015. While S√°enz was Minister of Finance, Costa Rica was plagued by economic instability and social unrest. Throughout the Carazo presidency, there was a world economic recession. Oil prices were at historic highs and the value of Costa Rica's main crop, coffee, was falling. Carazo instructed the Central Bank of Costa Rica to borrow heavily in order to maintain the value of the Costa Rican col√≥n, hoping that an economic recovery was close at hand. This policy eventually became unsustainable, leading to a catastrophic sudden devaluation in September 1980. Skyrocketing rates of inflation prompted capital flight, crippling internal business operations. In all, the national debt rose from $800 million to over $3 billion due to the government's mismanagement of the economy. As a result, in 1981 S√°enz was forced to suspend servicing Costa Rica's external debt. S√°enz asked the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to provide Costa Rica with an emergency loan package to ameliorate the debt crisis. As a precondition for the IMF loan package, S√°enz agreed to sweeping austerity measures demanded by the IMF, including a devaluation of the col√≥n, reduction of public subsidies and spending, removal of price controls, and reform of the tax structure. Carazo's government ended up not complying with the draconian and one-sided concessions that S√°enz had made to the IMF. S√°enz resigned in protest, hoping other government officials would follow suit, but to no avail. The Costa Rican government simply could not continue under the austerity measures, and the IMF suspended its financial assistance. At the time of S√°enz' resignation, the country was left on the verge of bankruptcy and with a rate of inflation at nearly 100 percent. The heavy load of debt that the central bank acquired during that period has contributed to the high rates of inflation that Costa Rica has endured ever since. S√°enz subsequently resettled in the United States and took a position as the Executive Secretary of the Administrative Tribunal of the Inter- American Development Bank in Washington, DC, until his retirement in 2015.

Like in other belids, their antennae are straight, not elbowed as in the true weevils (Curculionidae). They occur only on the Pacific Islands and in the Macaronesian region. Description The Aglycyderini have several highly distinctive characters as adults: The rostrum of adult Aglycyderini is very short compared to the average belid and attaches exactly symmetrically at the tip of the head; at first glance, do not look \\"snouted\\" but merely somewhat long-headed. Viewed in profile, the head is flat-sided and almost triangular in males, and somewhat swollen and rounded in females. The prementum is large and prevents the maxillae from being seen from below. The sternite of the mesothorax is slightly convex and extends to between the midlegs in a smooth inward curve. That tarsus, lacking the first segment, is pseudotrimerous. The outer edges of the second tarsal segment are rounded. In females, the ninth tergite is changed into a thin membrane. Intestinally, they show well- developed proventricular blades with sharp external ridges, and a hindgut with rectal loop. Systematics and evolution The Aglycyderini contain a mere 3 living genera, though Proterhinus has more than 165 species courtesy of fulminant adaptive radiation in the Hawaiian islands. The genera do not differ very much and the Aglycyderini cannot be divided into subtribes. And though Aglycyderes seems to be the most distinct, the relationship between the genera is not all too well resolved. Often, the Aglycyderini are treated as a distinct subfamily Aglycyderinae. Sometimes, this is due to the Oxycoryninae being treated as a family of their own rather than as a part of the Belidae. Other authors treat them as a subfamily of the Belidae. However, they share many traits with the Metrioxenini and are thus better treated as one of the three main lineages of the Oxycoryninae. The fossil record of the Metrioxenini shows that they were well distinct by the mid-Paleogene, about 50 million years ago (mya). The belids as a whole are of Jurassic origin, and the Aglycyderini must thus have evolved in the Late Cretaceous or perhaps Paleocene, roughly some 100-60 mya.Marvaldi et al. (2006), Ming et al. (2006) Distribution The distribution of the Aglycyderini is very puzzling. Aglycyderes contains one species in the Canary Islands and one in nearby Morocco. Aralius has one named species in New Zealand and one named and two known but undescribed species in New Caledonia. Proterhinus with its 167 or so known species is found mainly in the Hawaiian Islands. Three of its species are found on the Marquesas Islands, three others in the neighboring Society and Austral Islands (and several undescribed ones are known from the latter group), and one from Phoenix Island between the Marquesas and Hawaii. Another undescribed species has been reported from Fiji. Finally, Proterhinus samoae is an originally Samoan species that feeds on Coconut Palms (Cocos nucifera) and has been widely dispersed to coconut plantations across Melanesia, Micronesia and Polynesia. It is not clear why there are no Aglycyderini in Australia, and though their distribution looks clearly relictual, this does not answer the question how these weevils should have arrived in the Macaronesian region: there is no record of them from the more than Direct distance. Considering their ecological limitation, the actual route of dispersal would probably be closer to . between Morocco and Micronesia. Ecology As far as is known, their larvae like those of other Belidae feed on the wood and fruits of diseased or dying plants or on deadwood; they tend to avoid healthy plants. Aglycyderes larvae feed on the dead wood of spurges (Euphorbia, Euphorbiaceae). Aralius larvae eat deadwood of Pseudopanax (Araliaceae). The larvae of most Proterhinus also live on deadwood (some are leaf miners), but are found on a wide range of plants, unusual for belids which tend to have coevolved with their host plants since the Mesozoic. There is no clear opinion of the host plants of the ancestral Aglycyderini, but their present-day host plants suggests that they were more likely than not rather advanced eudicots. This also would support the view that the Aglycyderini evolved not in the Jurassic or Early Cretaceous, and consequently justify their treatment as tribe of the Oxycoryninae. =Recorded host plants of Proterhinus= As can be seen below, the host plants of Proterhinus are more limited by what is available on their remote island homes than other factors like what chemical defences (like alkaloids and terpenoids) the beetles must overcome. It stands to note however that some of the plant families that are more noxious to herbivores - like Lamiaceae (labiates) or Solanaceae (nightshades) - are missing despite being technically available. On the other hand, the Rubiaceae (which are usually rich in alkaloids) are the family with the most recorded host genera. Classification of the host plants is from Plant Systematics: A Phylogenetic Approach.

It received its charter in 1887, when a group of college friends, principally alumni of Harvard, Yale, and Princeton, founded the club hoping to further their collegial ties and enjoy intellectual pursuits.  History  Though officially chartered in 1887 by university graduates for \\"the promotion of literature and art, by establishing and maintaining a library, reading room and gallery of art, and by such other means as shall be expedient and proper for such purposes\\", the University Club of Chicago's history begins in 1885 when a group of Harvard men formed an association of college alumni in a similar fashion to the University Club of New York. The primary requirement of admission remains a college or university degree.  Building  University Club, February 2017 The club's first home was on the third and fourth floors of the Henning & Speed Building at 22 West Madison Street. The second club home was a stand-alone building at 30 North Dearborn. The first committee on literature and art was established in 1895, the library in 1897 with 1000 volumes. Honored guests included Admiral George Dewey (1900) and Winston Churchill (1901). The club's present building, begun in 1907 and completed in 1909, is a historic landmark designed by notable architect Martin Roche, and is arguably the first \\"gothic skyscraper\\". At a cost of over $1.1 million, it was one of the most important club buildings of its day and continues to be an architecturally significant structure.

He is best known as the first to compute œÄ to 100,000 decimal places, and for his book Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. Life and education Dan Shanks (he insisted that everyone call him Dan ) was born on January 17, 1917, in Chicago, Illinois, and he is not related to the English mathematician William Shanks, who was also known for computation of œÄ. He earned his Bachelor of Science degree in physics from the University of Chicago in 1937 and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from the University of Maryland in 1954. In between these two, Shanks worked at the Aberdeen Proving Ground and the Naval Ordnance Laboratory, first as a physicist and then as a mathematician. During this period he also wrote his Ph.D. thesis (completed in 1949), despite having never taken any graduate math courses. After earning his Ph.D. in mathematics, Shanks continued working at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory and the Naval Ship Research and Development Center at the David Taylor Model Basin, where he stayed until 1976. He then spent a year at National Bureau of Standards before moving to the University of Maryland as an adjunct professor. He remained in Maryland for the rest of his life. Dan Shanks died on September 6, 1996. Works Shanks worked primarily in numerical analysis and number theory, but he had many interests and also did some work in black body radiation, ballistics, mathematical identities, and Epstein zeta functions. =Numerical analysis= Shanks's most prominent work in numerical analysis was a collaboration with John Wrench and others to compute the number œÄ to 100,000 decimals on a computer. This was done in 1961 on an IBM 7090 and it was a major advance over previous work. Shanks was an editor of the Mathematics of Computation from 1959 until his death. He was noted for his very thorough reviews of papers, and for being a jack-of-all-trades who did whatever was necessary to get the journal out. =Number theory= In number theory, Shanks is best known for his book Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory. Hugh Williams described it as \\"a charming, unconventional, provocative, and fascinating book on elementary number theory.\\" It is a wide-ranging book, but most of the topics depend on quadratic residues and Pell's equation. The third edition contains a long essay on \\"judging conjectures\\". Shanks contended that there should be a lot of evidence that something is true before we classify it as a conjecture (otherwise it should be an Open Question and we should not take sides on it), and his essay gives many examples of bad thinking deriving from premature conjecturing. Writing about the possible non-existence of odd perfect numbers, which had been checked to 1050, he famously remarked that \\"1050 is a long way from infinity.\\" Most of Shanks's number theory work was in computational number theory. He developed a number of fast computer factorization methods based on quadratic forms and the class number. His algorithms include: Baby-step giant-step algorithm for computing the discrete logarithm, which is useful in public-key cryptography; Shanks's square forms factorization, an integer factorization method that generalizes Fermat's factorization method; and the Tonelli‚ÄìShanks algorithm that finds square roots modulo a prime, which is useful for the quadratic sieve method of integer factorization. In 1974, Shanks and John Wrench did some of the first computer work on estimating the value of Brun's constant, the sum of the reciprocals of the twin primes, calculating it over the twin primes among the first two million primes.

Creed and songs Auburn University has a creed, an alma mater, and a fight song. =Auburn Creed= In the early 1940s, Auburn professor George Petrie, who brought football to Auburn in 1891, wrote a creed which grew to become a unifying set of beliefs and principles common to all Auburn students, faculty, and alumni. This creed is said to embody the spirit of Auburn and is reflected in every member of the Auburn family. Placard with the Auburn Creed outside of Petrie Hall, Auburn University The Auburn Creed was written in 1943,Shug Jordan had a copy of the first publication of the Auburn Creed with him on D-Day: The War Eagle Reader not 1945 as is frequently stated in various Auburn publications. It was first published in Auburn's student newspaper in 1944. =Alma mater= Auburn's alma mater was composed by Bill Wood in 1924, with revision to its lyrics by Emma O'Rear Foy in 1960. The 1960 changes became necessary when the Alabama Legislature granted university status to what had been known as Alabama Polytechnic Institute. The author of the 1960 revision was unclear until 2000, when Auburn professor Dale Coleman discovered the author to be Foy, wife of former Dean of Students James Foy. Both were University of Alabama alumni who later became boosters of Auburn. Originally the first verse and refrain were: =Fight song= Samford Hall, with a clock tower that encloses a carillon that plays the university fight song once a day. Auburn University's fight song, \\"War Eagle\\", was written in 1954 and 1955 by Robert Allen and Al Stillman. It was introduced at the beginning of the 1955 football season and served as the official fight song ever since. The alternate version the second half of the lyrics has been around since the initial publication, but is rarely heard. It was designed for use when singing with children, and for those offended by hell in the lyrics: The carillon in the Samford Hall clock tower play the fight song every day at noon.Road Trip: Auburn, a September 14, 2006 SI on Campus article from Sports Illustrated Game-day traditions =A-Day= Each spring, a Founder's Day celebration is held in Auburn. As part of this celebration, the football team plays a scrimmage game that gives Auburn fans a chance to preview the Tigers before the fall. =Tiger Walk= Two hours before the kickoff of each Auburn home football game, thousands of Auburn fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they walk from the Auburn Athletic Complex to Jordan‚ÄìHare Stadium. The tradition began in the 1960s when groups of kids would walk up the street to greet the team and get autographs. During his tenure, coach Doug Barfield urged fans to come out and support the team, and thousands did, including the person responsible for starting this tradition: Dick Andrews. Today the team, led by the coaches, walks down the hill and into the stadium surrounded by fans who pat them on the back and shake their hands as they walk. To date, the largest Tiger Walk occurred on December 2, 1989, before the first ever home football game against rival Alabama--the Iron Bowl. On that day, an estimated 20,000 fans packed the one block section of road leading to the stadium. According to former athletic director David Housel, Tiger Walk has become \\"the most copied tradition in all of college football.\\" =Toomer's Corner= Tiger Paw painted on the street at Toomer's Corner with Toomer's Drugs in the background. The intersection of Magnolia Avenue and College Street in Auburn, which marks the transition from downtown Auburn to the university campus, is known as Toomer's Corner. It is named for businessman and State Senator Sheldon \\"Shel\\" Toomer who founded Toomer's Drugs on the corner of Magnolia Avenue and College Street in 1896, and helped to found the Bank of Auburn in 1907.

Also known as \\"rolling the corner\\" or \\"rolling Toomer's,\\" the tradition is often said to have begun when Toomer's Drugs had the only telegraph in the city. During away football games, when employees of the local drug store received news of a win, they would throw the ticker tape from the telegraph onto the power lines.

Aubie is the official tiger mascot of Auburn University. Aubie is an anthropomorphic tiger. Aubie has very animated characteristics such as his strut walk, quick turns, and exaggerated pointing. His style is to mix tiger and human traits such as using props, riding a moped, leading the band, and performing clownish pranks. Aubie made his debut in 1979 and is a popular beloved character among Auburn fans and one of the more animated mascots in the country. Aubie has won a record nine mascot national championships (his latest coming in 2016),http://www.varsity.com/uploads/events/eventid_1809/files/Mascot_DivisionIA_FinalsResults.pdf more than any other mascot in the United States. Aubie was named the 2014 Capital One Mascot of the Year and was among the first three college mascots inducted to the Mascot Hall of Fame, inducted on August 15, 2006. Birmingham artist Phil Neel first drew the cartoon tiger Aubie in the late 1950s. From 1958 through 1976, Aubie was featured on the cover of all of Auburn's home football game programs. In 1979, James Lloyd, spirit director for the Auburn Student Government Association, brought Aubie to life when he ordered a man- sized Tiger costume based upon the cartoon and wore it to the Southeastern Conference basketball tournament. Barry Mask became the first official Aubie in 1979-80. Aubie won an eighth Universal Cheerleaders' Association mascot championship on January 17, 2014. Aubie was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame on August 15, 2006. He was part of the first group of three collegiate mascots inducted. =War Eagle= Nova, War Eagle VII. The Auburn University battle cry is \\"War Eagle\\". It originated as an expression of support of Auburn's athletic teams, but today is also commonly used as a greeting between members of the Auburn community. The cry is yelled in unison by spectators for kickoffs of football games and tip-offs of basketball games. In 1930, Auburn gained a live golden eagle mascot, known as \\"Tiger\\". Today, the seventh War Eagle, nicknamed \\"Nova\\", lives at a raptor center on the Auburn campus, and is featured before football games by a flight in which the eagle circles the stadium before landing at mid-field. Auburn University's website states that the most popular version of the \\"War Eagle\\" story dates back to 1892 when Auburn and Georgia met for the first time on the football field. The story tells of a Civil War veteran and his pet eagle he had found on a battlefield and rescued. During the game, the eagle soared into the sky over their field as the Auburn football team simultaneously charged the Georgia end zone and achieved their first, exhilarating win over Georgia. After the Tigers' victory, the eagle suddenly nose-dived, crashed into the field and died. But the \\"War Eagle\\" lived on in the hearts and spirits of proud Auburn fans everywhere. =Wreck Tech Pajama Parade= The Wreck Tech Pajama Parade was inspired by a prank pulled by a group of mischievous Auburn cadets who, determined to show up the more well-known engineers from Georgia Tech, sneaked out of their dorms the night before the 1896 football game between Auburn and Tech and greased the railroad tracks leading into Auburn.USA Today: 1896 Auburn prank on Georgia Tech second best in college sports history According to the story, the train carrying the Georgia Tech team slid through town and didn't stop until it was halfway to the neighboring town of Loachapoka, Alabama, The Georgia Tech team was forced to walk the five miles back to Auburn and, not surprisingly, was weary at the end of their journey, likely contributing to their subsequent 45-0 loss. USA Today ranked the prank as the second best college football-related prank in history. While the railroad long ago ceased to be the way teams traveled to Auburn and students never greased the tracks again, the tradition continued through 1988 in the form of a parade through downtown Auburn, as students paraded through the streets in their pajamas and organizations built floats. This tradition was recently renewed in 2003 and 2005, when Georgia Tech returned to Auburn's schedule after nearly two decades of absence. =Auburn University Marching Band= Founded in 1897, the band has long performed at school football games and pep rallies. The band was awarded the 2004 Sudler Intercollegiate Marching Band Trophy, the nation's highest award for college and university marching bands. The Auburn University Marching Band marched in the United States Presidential Inaugural Parade (for President George W. Bush) in 2005. In 2006, the Auburn University Marching Band had over 375 members, the largest in Auburn University history. The Auburn University Marching Band performed on January 15, 2007 at the Alabama Governor's Inaugural Parade in Montgomery and in 2008 in the St. Patrick's Day Parades in Limerick and Dublin, Ireland. The Tiger Eyes are the \\"visual ensemble\\" of the Auburn University Marching Band. The Tiger Eyes are composed of three distinct lines‚Äîflags, majorettes, and dancers‚Äîthat feature complementary choreography. The three lines work for one common visual effect as one ensemble. Tiger Eyes are selected by individual auditions. Other traditions =Callouts= Callouts is a tradition in which members of one of Auburn's many organizations will stand on the back steps of Cater Hall and \\"call out\\" the new members of the organization. After being \\"called out,\\" new members traditionally run up the steps and join the other new members inside Cater Hall. The Student Government Association, Student Recruiters, and Camp War Eagle are just a few of the organizations that participate in the tradition. It is typical for friends and family of the candidates to attend callouts in support. =Hey Day= Hey Day is a tradition that takes place in both the fall and spring semesters dedicated to promoting friendliness on Auburn's campus. Students, faculty, and staff wear name tags and say \\"hey\\" to those they pass. There is also free food for students and entertainment provided by various campus performance groups. Despite AU officially dating the tradition to the 1950s, it actually started at some point in the 1940s.Hey Day in its Heyday http://www.thewareaglereader.com/2013/10/hey-day-in-its- heyday/#.VDvjrOfOSDo In 1985, there was a comical, short-lived Hey Day countermovement.How‚Äôs It Goin‚Äô Man Day was Hey Day‚Äôs cooler cousin in 1985: The War Eagle Reader =Homecoming= Though the 100th anniversary of homecoming at Auburn was celebrated in 2016, Auburn's first homecoming was actually held in 1909 and may have been the first college homecoming celebration in America.Auburn‚Äîand America‚Äôs?‚Äîfirst homecoming was definitely held in 1909, not 1913: The War Eagle Reader =Foy Information Desk= The Foy Information Desk is a telephone and walk-in information service provided by the university and is hosted in the new Student Union building.

Early life Martin was born in Elizabeth City, North Carolina, the son of Dr. William D. Martin and Sophia Dange Martin. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point and graduated in 1840, fourteenth in the class, directly behind future Confederate general Richard S. Ewell. On July 12, 1844, Martin married Mary Ann Murray Read, great granddaughter of Declaration of Independence signer George Read and General William Thompson.General James Green Martin biography at Thomas' LegionJames Green Martin biography at ncgenweb.us Military career Martin was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the First Regiment of the United States Artillery. He served mainly on the northern coast, on the frontier of Maine, in the Aroostock War, and in the coastal survey. He served in the Mexican War and took part in the battles of Monterey, Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Contreras and Churubusco, where he lost his right arm after it was shattered by grapeshot. After the wounding, Martin left the field with his sleeve clenched between his teeth and relinquished command of the battery to Stonewall Jackson. Due to the loss of his arm, Martin became known by the nickname \\"Old One Wing.\\" Martin was brevetted as a major for his performance at Churubusco and Contreras. After the Mexican War, Martin transferred to staff and was appointed assistant quartermaster and was stationed at Fortress Monroe, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Governor's Island. Martin then went to Fort Snelling in Minnesota. While there, his wife Mary Ann died. On February 8, 1858, he married Hetty King, sister of General Rufus King. Martin next took part in the Utah War under Albert Sidney Johnston and at the outbreak of the Civil War, he was on staff duty at Fort Riley, Kansas. Civil War Resigning his commission on June 14, 1861, Martin offered his services to North Carolina, and was commissioned as a captain in the cavalry. Martin was later appointed adjutant general of North Carolina. At his suggestion, blockade-running ships were first employed to bring supplies to the Confederacy from Europe. On September 28, 1861, he was appointed commander-in-chief of the state forces, with the rank of major general of militia. Martin was able to raise 12,000 more men than the state quota. After Martin had completed this work, he applied for duty in the field, and in May 1862, he was promoted to brigadier general in the provisional army. In August 1862, he was given command of the district of North Carolina, with headquarters at Kinston, North Carolina. In the fall of 1863, he was directed to organize a brigade from the troops at his disposal and take the field. With this brigade, he went into camp near Wilmington, North Carolina. When Major General George E. Pickett made his demonstration against New Bern in February 1864, Martin successfully attacked and drove the Union troops from Newport. When the Overland Campaign opened, Martin was called to Petersburg. He was the first in the field under Major General William Henry Chase Whiting. Major General Daniel Harvey Hill took command of the division on May 20, and Martin's brigade won distinction for their charge, driving the enemy from the works in their front. Afterwards his men carried him around on their shoulders, shouting, \\"Three cheers for Old One Wing.\\" The brigade was then assigned to Robert Hoke's division, and reinforced Robert E. Lee at Turkey Hill during the Battle of Cold Harbor, where they repulsed the Union assaults on June 3, and afterward were engaged in a sharpshooting fight along the line. Lee, believing Ulysses S. Grant would make another attack, informed Martin that he held the key to the Confederate position, and asked if his troops, comparatively new, could be relied upon. Martin promptly responded that his men were as good as veterans, but that he thought he should be transferred to the south of the James River, as he believed Grant would attack Richmond from the rear. Lee then sent Martin's brigade to Petersburg. During the siege, Martin's health gave way under the strain and exposure, and he was transferred to the command of the district of Western North Carolina, with headquarters at Asheville. After he had left the Army of Northern Virginia, Lee stated that \\"General Martin is one to whom North Carolina owes a debt she can never repay.\\" Martin surrendered the Army of Western North Carolina in Waynesville, North Carolina on May 6, 1865. This was the last organized Confederate force remaining in the state. Post-war life After the war ended, Martin was financially ruined. He studied law and practiced it in Asheville for the remainder of his life. Martin died on October 4, 1878 and is buried in Asheville's Riverside Cemetery.

It is located at 756 Mission Street, between 3rd and 4th streets, across the street from Yerba Buena Gardens in the heart of the South of Market district. History On June 9, 1851, the church held its very first mass in a hall on the corner of 4th and Jessie streets. A couple of months later a temporary church was built facing Market Street on the land where the Palace Hotel stands today. Inspired by the Irish population in the area, it was given the name of Ireland's patron saint, Saint Patrick. After the Civil War droves of people immigrated to San Francisco and the need for a bigger church grew. As a result, a new church facing Mission Street was constructed and opened in April 1870. It was dedicated by the then archbishop Joseph Alemany, O.P.. Many described it as the most magnificent church west of Chicago. During the 1906 San Francisco earthquake the church was completely destroyed. The foundation and parts of the walls were the only portions of the building that still stood. Since many were shaken up and were in despair, many of the parishioners left the church. In the meantime, masses were held in the sandlots on Folsom Street between 3rd and 4th streets. They also built a permanent shelter called Tir-Na-Og (Land of the Young) which would be later called St. Patrick's shelter. Those who remained constructed a new church, similar to the old church. It was desired for it to be the church for the Irish in the West Coast. In 1968, the church became a San Francisco landmark. Later on, as the redevelopment of the Yerba Buena area occurred, the church remained unchanged as its surroundings were transforming into a modern look into the new millennium. The church has been home to many nationalities. Reflecting the population shifts of the South of Market neighborhood, the Irish has given way to the Spanish community, which then, in turn, gave way to the Filipino community. Today, Filipinos make up the majority of parishioners. It also caters to the business people and tourists in the area. It regularly holds CCD and RCIA classes. It also has many devotions and novenas that have been influenced by the Filipino community. Masses are held daily and the church is open until 6:15 pm on weekdays and 6:45 pm on weekends. Architecture The church features Gothic Revival architecture, with ribbed vaults, pointed arches, a central nave and two side aisles of lower height. The nave follows the basic Gothic pattern with a triforium and clerestory-like top tier. Inspired by the national colors of Ireland, it features green Connemara marble (Verd antique, serpentine marble) and white and gold Bontticino marble. Decorating the church are Tiffany-style stained glass windows depicting the patron saints of Ireland's 32 counties.

There are four known receptors which mediate various but often different cellular and tissue responses to PGE2: prostaglandin EP1 receptor, prostaglandin EP2 receptor, prostaglandin EP3 receptor, and prostaglandin EP4 receptor. Sulprosotone binds to and activates the prostaglandin EP3 receptor with far greater efficacy than the other PGE2 receptors and also has the advantage of being relatively resistant, compared with PGE2, to becoming metabolically degraded. It is listed as a comparatively weak receptor agonist of the prostaglandin EP1 receptor. In all events, this as well as other potent synthetic EP3 receptor antagonists have the realized or potential ability to promote the beneficial effects of prostaglandin EP3 receptor activation. Sulprostone (as well as other prostanoids receptor agonists) is in use for inducting medical abortion and ending pregnancy after fetal death, for the treatment of severe atonic postpartum hemorrhage after vaginal delivery, and for removal of the placenta in patients with retained placenta. Currently, sulprostone along with SC-46275, MB-28767, ONO-AE-248 and other EP3 receptor agonists are in development as drugs for the possible treatment of stomach ulcers in humans.

It is the first book in The Russel Middlebrook Series. The novel follows a group of high school students who feel like outsiders, some because of their sexual orientations. The narrator, Russel Middlebrook, then finds himself helping his friend Min to form an after school club for the students, so that they can hang out together for support. Plot Russel Middlebrook is keeping a secret from his two best friends, Min, a bright Chinese American girl, and Gunnar, a bright and socially awkward boy. Neither of them knows he is gay and that he has been visiting an internet chat room to chat with other gay teens. When he discovers another guy from his high school in the room Russel is keen to meet up. He is surprised but pleased to find out his online friend is the popular Kevin Land. Russel shares this news with Min who says that she is bisexual and has a girlfriend, the soccer-playing Terese. Min suggests setting up an after-school Gay/Bi/Straight Alliance group for support. The group meets and decides on the Geography Club name to keep it private. At school Gunnar, who is unaware of Russel's sexuality, persuades Russel to go on a double date with him and two popular girls from their school. Russel is reluctant to go on the date but agrees to do it for Gunnar, as this would be the only way for him to go on a date. When Gunnar and Russel go on their double date, Gunnar is happy but Russel only puts up with it for his friend's sake. Russel's date tries to have sex with him and he puts her off by saying he's a virgin and he wants his first time to be special. Russel joins the school baseball team so he can be part of Kevin's crowd. Russel plays well and wins a game for his team. Russel persuades Kevin to come to the Geography Club meeting. At school, Kevin and his jock friends make fun of the school outcast Brian Bund and Russel joins in. Min sees this and is disgusted. Brian wants to join the Geography Club but Kevin and Russel vote against this. Min wanted to let him join and is angry with Russel for voting with Kevin. Min suggests they make the club public, making Kevin and Terese nervous. Terese breaks up with Min. Gunnar persuades Russel to go on a second double date with the girls, this time at a cabin outside town. Russel is again pressured for sex and when Gunnar refuses to drive him home, Russel storms off. He phones Kevin who drives out to get him and they end up making out. When rumors are spread by his unhappy date and her friend saying about a gay kid wanting to start a Gay/Straight Alliance, and that it must be Russel because he wouldn't make out with the girl. Kevin starts avoiding him. By lunchtime, Russell has nowhere to sit in the cafeteria except by Brian, as they are now both outcasts. Brian writes in an application for a Gay-Straight club making people think he's the \\"gay kid\\". Russel asks Brian whether he's gay, and Brian says No but he doesn't want others to get treated like he is. The Geography Club resumes meeting this time seeking more open membership as an official club. After a showdown with the principal, approval is given and a liaison teacher appointed. Gunnar apologizes to Russel and says he always knew he must be gay and he's sorry he pushed him into the dates. Kevin isn't willing to be out and he ends his romance with Russel.

Feeling that he had developed well in the Mexican League, the Yankees purchased Aceves, along with Manny Banuelos and two other players, for $450,000 during the 2007‚Äì08 offseason. He began with the Single-A Advanced Tampa Yankees. He was quickly promoted to the Double-A Trenton Thunder and Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Yankees. He was named Eastern League pitcher of the week for the week ending May 25, 2008. After going a combined 8-6 with a 2.62 earned run average (ERA) on the three Yankee farm teams, Aceves was called up to the Yankees on August 28, . On August 31, Aceves made his Yankee and major league debut, pitching two scoreless innings in relief. After pitching effectively through his first few relief appearances, Aceves was moved to the rotation in replacement of Darrell Rasner. In his first career start, he pitched seven innings of one-run ball with two strikeouts against the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, earning the win. After starting the season in the minors, Aceves rejoined the Yankees on May 4. Due to his ability to pitch effectively in any situation, Aceves has drawn comparisons to former Yankee reliever and spot starter Ramiro Mendoza. Aceves made ten relief appearances in 2010 before succumbing to a strained lower back that ended his season. He suffered a broken collarbone in an off-season bicycle accident. He was non-tendered after the season.Yankees cut loose Aceves, Moseley MLB.com =Boston Red Sox= Aceves pitching for the Red Sox in 2011 Aceves was signed to a major league deal by the Boston Red Sox on February 8, 2011.Red Sox sign Aceves to Major League deal MLB.com On April 21, he was optioned to the Triple-A Pawtucket Red Sox to make room for Matt Albers on the roster.Red Sox Activate Matt Albers From 15-Day Disabled List, Option Alfredo Aceves to Pawtucket, NESN, April 21, 2011. On May 6 he was called back up, and on May 16 he won his first game with the Red Sox. Between then and September 1, Aceves has a 9‚Äì1 record out of the bullpen for Boston. After an injury to Andrew Bailey, Aceves was named the acting closer for the beginning of the 2012 season, but had a slow start, surrendering the game-winning hit on Opening Day and allowing a game-tying home run in the 9th inning of the 3rd game of the season. In late August, once Bailey returned from his injury, he took the closer role back. After five games in 2013, which included three starts, Aceves was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on April 25 two days after giving away eight runs in 3.1 innings against the Oakland Athletics. Aceves was recalled on May 24 for a one-off start against the Philadelphia Phillies. Despite the win, he was optioned to Triple-A Pawtucket on May 28. He was recalled again on June 12, and returned to Pawtucket the next day. He was recalled on July 7 when Andrew Miller suffered a year-ending foot injury. He was optioned 3 days later. On July 14, Aceves was outrighted off the 40-man roster after clearing waivers. He elected free agency on October 4. =Baltimore Orioles= Aceves signed a minor league deal with the Baltimore Orioles in January 2014.

Early life and education Piotrowski was born in 1934, in Detroit and graduated from Henry Ford Trade School in Dearborn, Michigan, in 1951. He attended Arizona State University and Florida State University, and graduated from the University of Nebraska at Omaha in 1965 with a Bachelor of Science degree. He did postgraduate work at the University of Southern California and Auburn University, and attended the program for management development at Harvard University. He completed Squadron Officer School in 1956, Air Command and Staff College in 1965, Armed Forces Staff College in 1968 and the Royal Air Force College of Air Warfare, Royal Air Force Station Manby, England, in 1971. Military career He enlisted in the U.S. Air Force in September 1952. After basic training at Lackland Air Force Base, Texas, he was assigned to Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi, as a student in basic electronics and ground radar. In July 1953 Piotrowski transferred to Harlingen Air Force Base, Texas, for navigator and observer training in the aviation cadet program. After graduating as a distinguished graduate, he was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Air Force in August 1954. He then returned to Keesler Air Force Base for advanced training in electronic countermeasures. In January 1955 he received the electronic warfare rating and was assigned to the 67th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing in South Korea and Japan as an electronic warfare officer and RB-26 navigator. Piotrowski returned to the United States in May 1957 for pilot training at Marana Air Base, Arizona; Bainbridge Air Base, Georgia; and Bryan Air Force Base, Texas. He then attended F-86F advanced gunnery training at Williams Air Force Base, Arizona. After graduation he was assigned as armament and electronics maintenance officer at Williams and, later, at Luke Air Force Base, Arizona. In May 1961 he moved to Eglin Air Force Auxiliary Field 9, Florida, and joined the initial cadre of Project Jungle Jim, which became the 1st Air Commando Wing. While assigned to Eglin, he served in Southeast Asia, from November 1961 to May 1963, as a munitions maintenance officer, and T-28 and B-26 combat aircrew member. In August 1965 Piotrowski joined the Air Force Fighter Weapons School at Nellis Air Force Base, Nevada, and served as an F-4C instructor pilot, chief of academics, an academic instructor and project officer for the Air Force operational test and evaluation of the Walleye missile program. Upon completion of testing in the United States, he introduced the Walleye into combat with the 8th Tactical Fighter Wing in Southeast Asia. After graduation from the Armed Forces Staff College in August 1968, he was assigned to Headquarters U.S. Air Force, Washington, D.C., as an action officer under the deputy director of plans for force development. From December 1970 to July 1971 he attended the Royal Air Force College of Air Warfare. He was then assigned to Bitburg Air Base, West Germany, as assistant and, subsequently, deputy commander for operations, 36th Tactical Fighter Wing. In January 1972 he took command of the 40th Tactical Group, Aviano Air Base, Italy. In April 1974 Piotrowski became chief of the Air Force Six-Man Group, located at Maxwell Air Force Base, directly responsible to the chief of staff. He became vice commander of Keesler Technical Training Center, Keesler Air Force Base, in March 1975. He took command of the reactivated 552d Airborne Warning and Control Wing at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma, in July 1976 and was instrumental in establishing the E-3A Sentry Airborne Warning and Control System aircraft as an operational Air Force weapon system. While Congress debated the E-3 future (due to huge cost over-runs), General Piotrowski took the planes on continuous road shows. Especially Europe, and Korea. He filled the planes with observers who would benefit, or could appreciate the capability to project tactical forces anywhere in the world, in less than 24 hours. He was not only an effective leader, he was very personable and warm hearted. Before Piotrowski, the E-3 was going to be a system that would orbit America in defense, and after he arrived he changed the system to deploy to where the war was, and bring tankers and fighters along. A true tactical mission, with troops who could live out of an A-3 bag for 200 days a year. Piotrowski was named deputy commander for air defense, Tactical Air Command, Peterson Air Force Base, in September 1979. In April 1981 he became Tactical Air Command's deputy chief of staff for operations at Langley Air Force Base, Virginia, and in August 1982 was assigned as the command's vice commander. He served as commander of 9th Air Force, Shaw Air Force Base, South Carolina, from October 1982 to July 1985, when he became vice chief of staff of the Air Force, Washington, D.C. He assumed command of NORAD in February 1987. =Awards and decorations= Piotrowski was a command pilot with more than 5,000 flying hours, including 100 combat missions and 210 combat flying hours. His military decorations and awards include the Defense Distinguished Service Medal, Air Force Distinguished Service Medal, Legion of Merit, Meritorious Service Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Medal with two oak leaf clusters, Air Force Commendation Medal with oak leaf cluster, Presidential Unit Citation and Air Force Outstanding Unit Award with three oak leaf clusters.

It is read and written using a floppy disk drive (FDD). Floppy disks were an almost universal data format from the late 1970s into the 1990s, used for primary data storage as well as for backup and data transfers between computers. In 1967, at an IBM facility in San Jose (CA), work began on a drive that led to the world's first floppy disk and disk drive. It was introduced into the market in an 8-inch format in 1972. The more conveniently sized -inch disks were introduced in 1976, and became almost universal on dedicated word processing systems and personal computers. This format was more slowly replaced by the -inch format, first introduced in 1982. There was a significant period where both were popular. A number of other variant sizes were introduced over time, with limited market success. Floppy disks remained a popular medium for nearly 40 years, but their use was declining by the mid- to late 1990s. The introduction of high speed computer networking and formats based on the new NAND flash technique (like USB flash drives and memory cards) led to the eventual disappearance of the floppy disk as a standard feature of microcomputers, with a notable point in this conversion being the introduction of the floppy-less iMac in 1998. After 2000, floppy disks were increasingly rare and used primarily with older hardware and especially with legacy industrial computer equipment.  The 8-inch disk  Drawings from IBM Floppy Disk Drive Patents In 1967, IBM tasked their San Jose, California development laboratory with developing a reliable and inexpensive system for loading microcode into their System/370 mainframes in a process called Initial Control Program Load (ICPL). The System/370 was IBM's first computer system family to make extensive usage of volatile read/write semiconductor memory for microcode,The Model 85 of System/360 used a mixture of non-volatile Capacitive Read Only Storage and volatile semiconductor memory; however the latter was mainly used for emulation, microdiagnostics and some low cost features so for most models, wheneverExcept for the 155, 155 II, 165, 165 II and 195. the power was turned on, the microcode had to be loaded (System/370's predecessor, System/360, generally used non-volatile read-only memory for microcode). IBM also wanted inexpensive media that could be sent out to customers with software updates. IBM Direct Access Storage Product Manager, Alan Shugart, assigned the job to David L. Noble, who tried to develop a new-style tape for the purpose, but without success. The project was reassigned to Donald L. Wartner, 23FD Disk Drive manager, and Herbert E. Thompson, 23FD Disk manager, along with design engineers Warren L. Dalziel, Jay Brent Nilson, and Ralph Flores; and that team developed the IBM 23FD Floppy Disk Drive System (code name Minnow). The disk is a read-only, flexible diskette called the \\"memory disk\\" and holding 80 kilobytes of data. Initially the disk was bare, but dirt became a serious problem so they enclosed it in a plastic envelope lined with fabric that would remove dust particles. The Floppy Disk Patent #3,668,658, US Patent 3,668,658, \\"Magnetic Record Disk Cover\\", Flores, et al., assigned to IBM. was issued on June 6, 1972 with named inventors Ralph Flores and Herbert E. Thompson. The Floppy Disk Drive Patent #3,678,481US Patent 3,678,481, \\"Data Storage Apparatus Employing a Single Magnetic Disk,\\" Dalziel, et. al., assigned to IBM. was issued July 18, 1972 with named inventors Warren L. Dalziel, Jay. B. Nilson, and Donald L. Wartner. IBM introduced the diskette commercially in 1971.A Japanese inventor, Yoshiro Nakamatsu, claims to have invented core floppy disk technology in 1952 and further claims to have later licensed 16 patents to IBM for the creation of the floppy disk; however, there is no reliable source to support his assertions. The new device first shipped in 1971 as the 23FD, the program load component of the 2835 Storage Control Unit. and then as a standard part of most System 370 processing units and other IBM products. Internally IBM used another device, code named Mackerel, to write boot disks for distribution to the field. Alan Shugart left IBM and moved to Memorex where his team shipped the Memorex 650 in 1972, the first commercially available read-write floppy disk drive. The 650 had a data capacity of 175 kB, with 50 tracks, 8 sectors per track, and 448 bytes per sector. The Memorex disk was hard sectored, that is, it contained 8 sector holes (plus one index hole) at the outer diameter (outside data track 00) to synchronize the beginning of each data sector and the beginning of a track. Most early 8\\" disks were hard sectored, meaning that they had a fixed number of disk sectors (usually 8, 16, or 32), marked by physical holes punched around the disk hub, and the drive required the correct media type for its controller. In 1973, Shugart founded Shugart Associates which went on to become the dominant manufacturer of 8-inch floppy disk drives. Its SA800 became the industry standard for form factor and interface. In May 1973, IBM shipped its first read/write floppy disk drive, the 33FD, as a component of the 3740 Data Entry System, code named \\"IGAR\\", designed to directly replace IBM's punched card (\\"keypunch\\") data entry machines. The medium sold separately as \\"Diskette 1\\" and featured a Teflon-lubricated fabric liner to lengthen media life. In 1976, media supplier Information Terminals Corporation enhanced resilience further by adding a Teflon coating to the magnetic disk itself. The new system used a soft sector recording format that stored up to kB on the same disks; the disk was divided into 77 tracks of 26 sectors (a total of 2002 sectors), each holding 128 bytes. Drives supporting this format were offered by a number of manufacturers and soon became common for moving smaller amounts of data. This disk format became known as the Single Sided Single Density or SSSD format. It was designed to hold just as much data as one box of 2000 punch cards. 8-inch disk drive with diskette (-inch disk for comparison) When the first microcomputers were being developed in the 1970s, the 8-inch floppy found a place on them as one of the few \\"high speed, mass storage\\" devices that were even remotely affordable to the target market (individuals and small businesses). The first microcomputer operating system, CP/M, originally shipped on 8-inch disks. However, the drives were still expensive, typically costing more than the computer they were attached to in early days, so most machines of the era used cassette tape instead. In 1976, IBM introduced the 500 KB Double Sided Single Density (DSSD) format, and in 1977 IBM introduced the 1‚Äì1.2 MB Double Sided Double Density (DSDD) format.Five decades of disk drive industry firsts, DISK/TREND, publisher of market studies of the worldwide disk drive and data storage industries. web.archive.org Other 8-inch floppy disk formats such as the Burroughs 1 MB unit failed to achieve any market presence. At the end of 1978 the typical floppy disk price per piece was $5 () to $8 (). Sales in 1978 for all types of drives and media were expected to reach $135 million for media and $875 million for drives.https://www.nytimes.com/1978/12/10/archives/the-floppy- disk-comes-of-age-competing-with-paper.html The 8\\" floppy disk drive interface standard as developed from the Shugart Associates drives involved a 50-pin interface and a spindle motor that ran directly from the A/C line and spun constantly. Other later models used a DC motor with corresponding changes to the interface to start and stop the motor.  The -inch minifloppy  A double-density disk with a partly exposed magnetic medium spun about a central hub. The cover has a cloth liner to brush dust from the medium. Note the ‚Äúwrite-enable slot‚Äù to the upper right and the hole next to the hub that gives access to the index hole in the disk. In a 1976 meeting, An Wang of Wang Laboratories informed Jim Adkisson and Don Massaro of Shugart Associates that the 8-inch format was simply too large and expensive for the desktop word processing machines he was developing at the time, and argued for a US$100 drive. According to Massaro, Adkisson proposed a smaller size and began working with cardboard mockups before the Wang meeting. George Sollman suggests the size was the average of existing tape drives of the era. It is an urban legend that the physical size came about when they met with Wang at a bar in Boston; when he was asked what size would be appropriate, Wang pointed to a cocktail napkin‚Äîthere was no such meeting. The new drive of this size stored 98.5 KB, later increased to 110 KB by adding five tracks. The drive was considerably less expensive than 8-inch drives, and soon started appearing on CP/M machines. Shugart's initial 5.25\\" drive was the 35-track, single-sided SA-400, which was widely used in many early microcomputers, and which introduced the 34-pin interface that would become an industry standard. It could be used with either a hard or soft sectored controller, and storage capacity was listed as 90k (single density) or 113k (double density). The drive went on sale in late 1976 at a list price of $400, with a box of ten disks at $60. The new, smaller disk format was taken up quickly, and by 1978 ten different manufacturers were producing 5.25\\" drives. At one point, Shugart was producing 4,000 drives a day, but their ascendancy was short-lived; the company's fortunes declined in the early 1980s. Part of this was due to their failure to develop a reliable 80-track drive, increasing competition, and the loss of several lucrative contracts‚ÄîApple by 1982 had switched to using cheaper Alps drive mechanisms in their computers, and IBM chose Tandon as their sole supplier of disk drives for the PC. By 1977 Shugart had been purchased by Xerox, who closed the operations in 1985 and sold the brand to a third party. In 1978 I.T.C. (later called Verbatim), had approximately 35 percent of the estimated $135 million floppy disk market and sold 5.25 disks in large quantities for $1.50 each (). Apple purchased bare SA-400 drive mechanisms for their Disk II drive, which was then equipped with a custom Apple controller board and the faceplate stamped with the Apple logo. Steve Wozniak developed a recording scheme known as Group Code Record which allowed 140k of storage, well above the standard 90‚Äì113k, although the price of double density controllers fell not long after the Disk II's introduction. GCR recording used software means of detecting the track and sector being accessed, hence there was no need of hard sectored disks or even the index hole. Commodore also elected to use GCR recording (although a different variation not compatible with Apple's format) in their disk drive line. Tandy however used industry-standard FM on the TRS-80's disk drives, with stock Shugart SA-400s, and so had a mere 85k of storage. These early drives read only one side of the disk, leading to the popular budget approach of cutting a second write-enable slot and index hole into the carrier envelope and flipping it over (thus, the ‚Äúflippy disk‚Äù) to use the other side for additional storage. This was considered risky by some as single sided disks were only certified by the manufacturer for single-sided use. The reasoning was that, when flipped, the disk would spin in the opposite direction inside its cover, so some of the dirt that had been collected by the fabric lining in the previous rotations would be picked up by the disk and dragged past the read/write head. Although hard sectored disks were used on some early 8\\" drives prior to the IBM 33FD (May 1973), they were never widely used in 5.25\\" form, although North Star clung to the format until they went bankrupt in 1984. Tandon introduced a double-sided drive in 1978, doubling the capacity, and this new ‚Äúdouble sided double density‚Äù (DSDD) format increased capacity to 360 KB.48 tpi DSDD comprising 2 sides √ó 40 tracks/side √ó 9 sectors/track √ó 512 bytes/sector = 368.64 kByte or 360 KB, see Other formats with higher or lower capacities existed.. By 1979, there were also 77-track 5.25\\" drives available, mostly used in CP/M and other professional computers, and also found in some of Commodore's disk drive line. By the early 1980s, falling prices of computer hardware and technological advances led to the near-universal adoption of soft sector, double density disk formats. In addition, more compact half-height disk drives began to appear, as well as double-sided drives, although the cost of them meant that single-sided remained the standard for most home computers, and 80-track drives known as \\"quad density\\". For most of the 1970s and 1980s, the floppy drive was the primary storage device for word processors and microcomputers. Since these machines had no hard drive, the OS was usually booted from one floppy disk, which was then removed and replaced by another one containing the application. Some machines using two disk drives (or one dual drive) allowed the user to leave the OS disk in place and simply change the application disks as needed, or to copy data from one floppy to another. In the early 1980s, ‚Äúquad density‚Äù 96-track-per-inch drives appeared, increasing the capacity to 720 KB. RX50 was another proprietary format, used by Digital Equipment Corporation's Rainbow-100, DECmate-II, and Pro-350. It held 400 KB80 √ó 1 tracks √ó 10 blocks/track √ó 512 bytes on a single side by using 96 tracks per inch and cramming 10 sectors per track. White -inch floppy disk. Floppy disks were supported on IBM's PC DOS and Microsoft's MS-DOS from their beginning on the original IBM PC. With version 1.0 of PC DOS (1981), only single-sided 160 KB floppies were supported. Version 1.1 the next year saw support expand to double-sided 320 KB disks. Finally, in 1983, DOS 2.0 supported 9 sectors per track rather than 8, providing 180 KB on a (formatted) single-sided disk and 360 KB on a double-sided. In 1984, IBM introduced the 5.25\\" high density disk format with its new IBM AT machines. The 5.25\\" HD drive was essentially a scaled-down 8\\" drive, using the same rotation speed and bit rate, and it provided almost three times as much storage as the 360k format, but had compatibility issues with the older drives due to the narrower read/write head. Except for labeling, -inch high-density disks were externally identical to their double-density counterparts. This led to an odd situation wherein the drive itself was unable to determine the density of the disk inserted except by reading the disk media to determine the format. It was therefore possible to use a high-density drive to format a double-density disk to the higher capacity. This usually appeared to work (sometimes reporting a small number of bad sectors)‚Äîat least for a time. The problem was that the high-density format was made possible by the creation of a new high-coercivity oxide coating (after soft sector formatting became standard, previous increases in density were largely enabled by improvements in head technology; up until that point, the media formulation had essentially remained the same since 1976). In order to format or write to this high-coercivity media, the high-density drive switched its heads into a mode using a stronger magnetic field. When these stronger fields were written onto a double-density disk (having lower coercivity media), the strongly magnetized oxide particles would begin to affect the magnetic charge of adjacent particles. The net effect is that the disk would begin to erase itself. On the other hand, the opposite procedure (attempting to format an HD disk as DD) would fail almost every time, as the high-coercivity media would not retain data written by the low- power DD field. High-density -inch disks avoided this problem by the addition of a hole in the disk cartridge so that the drive could determine the appropriate density. However, the coercivity rating between the -inch DD and HD formats, 665 and 720 oersteds, is much narrower than that for the -inch format, 600 versus 300 oersteds, and consequently it was possible to format a -inch DD disk as HD with no apparent problems. By the end of the 1980s, the -inch disks had been superseded by the -inch disks. Though -inch drives were still available, as were disks, they faded in popularity as the 1990s began. The main community of users was primarily those who still owned 1980s legacy machines (PCs running DOS or home computers) that had no -inch drive; the advent of Windows 95 (not even sold in stores in a -inch version; a coupon had to be obtained and mailed in) and subsequent phaseout of stand-alone MS-DOS with version 6.22 forced many of them to upgrade their hardware. On most new computers, the -inch drives were optional equipment. By the mid-1990s, the drives had virtually disappeared as the -inch disk became the predominant floppy disk.  The \\"Twiggy\\" disk  FileWare diskette During the development of the Apple Lisa, Apple developed a disk format codenamed Twiggy, and officially known as FileWare. While basically similar to a standard -inch disk, the Twiggy disk had an additional set of write windows on the top of the disk with the label running down the side. The drive was also present in prototypes of the original Apple Macintosh computer, but was removed in both the Mac and later versions of the Lisa in favor of the -inch floppy disk from Sony. The drives were notoriously unreliable and Apple was criticized for needlessly diverging from industry standards. The case was reversed in September 1991.  The 3-inch compact floppy disk  Throughout the early 1980s, the limitations of the -inch format were starting to become clear. Originally designed to be smaller and more practical than the 8-inch format, the -inch system was itself too large, and as the quality of the recording media grew, the same amount of data could be placed on a smaller surface. Another problem was that the -inch disks were simply scaled down versions of the 8-inch disks, which had never really been engineered for ease of use. The thin folded-plastic shell allowed the disk to be easily damaged through bending, and allowed dirt to get onto the disk surface through the opening. A -inch floppy disk. A number of solutions were developed, with drives at 2-inch, -inch, 3-inch and -inch (50, 60, 75 and 90 mm), all being offered by various companies. They all shared a number of advantages over the older format, including a small form factor and a rigid case with a slideable write protect catch. The almost-universal use of the -inch format made it very difficult for any of these new formats to gain any significant market share. Some of these formats included Dysan and Shugart's -inch floppy disk, the later ubiquitous Sony -inch disk and the 3-inch format: * the 3-inch BRG MCD-1 developed in 1973 by , a Hungarian inventor of Budapest Radiotechnic Company (Budapesti R√°di√≥technikai Gy√°r). * the AmDisk-3 Micro-Floppy-disk cartridge system in December 1982, which was originally designed for use with the Apple II Disk II interface card * the Mitsumi Quick Disk 3-inch floppies. The CF has a harder casing than a -inch floppy; the metal door is opened by a sliding plastic tab on the right side. The 3-inch floppy drive itself was manufactured by Hitachi, Matsushita and Maxell. Only Teac outside this \\"network\\" is known to have produced drives. Similarly, only three manufacturers of media (Maxell, Matsushita and Tatung) are known (sometimes also branded Yamaha, Amsoft, Panasonic, Schneider, Tandy, Godexco and Dixons), but \\"no-name\\" disks with questionable quality have been seen in circulation. Amstrad included a 3-inch single-sided, double-density (180 KB) drive in their CPC and some models of PCW. The PCW 8512 included a double-sided, quad-density (720 KB) drive as the second drive, and later models, such as the PCW 9512, used quad-density even for the first drive. The single-sided double density (180 KB) drive was \\"inherited\\" by the ZX Spectrum +3 computer after Amstrad bought the rights from Sinclair. The Oric-1 and Atmos systems from Oric International also used the 3-inch floppy drives, originally shipping with the Atmos, but also supported on the older Oric-1. Since all 3-inch media were double-sided in nature, single-sided drive owners were able to flip the disk over to use the other side. The sides were termed \\"A\\" and \\"B\\" and were completely independent, but single-sided drive units could only access the upper side at one time. The disk format itself had no more capacity than the more popular (and cheaper) -inch floppies. Each side of a double-density disk held 180 KB for a total of 360 KB per disk, and 720 KB for quad-density disks. Unlike -inch or -inch disks, the 3-inch disks were designed to be reversible and sported two independent write-protect switches. It was also more reliable thanks to its hard casing. 3-inch drives were also used on a number of exotic and obscure CP/M systems such as the Tatung Einstein and occasionally on MSX systems in some regions. Other computers to have used this format are the more unknown Gavilan Mobile Computer and Matsushita's National Mybrain 3000. The Yamaha MDR-1 also used 3-inch drives. The main problems with this format were the high price, due to the quite elaborate and complex case mechanisms. However, the tip on the weight was when Sony in 1984 convinced Apple Computer to use the -inch drives in the Macintosh 128K model, effectively making the -inch drive a de facto standard. = Mitsumi's \\"Quick Disk\\" 3-inch floppies = Quick Disk for Family Computer Disk System A Smith Corona DataDisk 2.8-inch. Another 3-inch (75 mm) format was Mitsumi's Quick Disk format. The Quick Disk format is referred to in various size references: 2.8-inch, 3-inch√ó3-inch and 3-inch√ó4-inch. Mitsumi offered this as OEM equipment, expecting their VAR customers to customize the packaging for their own particular use; disks thus vary in storage capacity and casing size. The Quick Disk uses a 2.8-inch magnetic media, break-off write-protection tabs (one for each side), and contains a see-through hole near center spindle (used to ensure spindle clamping). Nintendo packaged the 2.8-inch magnetic media in a 3-inch√ó4-inch housing, while others packaged the same media in a 3 inch√ó3 inch square housing. The Quick Disk's most successful use was in Nintendo's Famicom Disk System (FDS). The FDS package of Mitsumi's Quick Disk used a 3-inch√ó4-inch plastic housing called the \\"Disk System Card\\". Most FDS disks did not have cover protection to prevent media contamination, but a later special series of five games did include a protective shutter. Mitsumi's \\"3-inch\\" Quick Disk media were also used in a 3-inch√ó3-inch housing for many Smith Corona word processors. The Smith Corona disks are confusingly labeled \\"DataDisk 2.8-inch\\", presumably referring to the size of the medium inside the hard plastic case. The Quick Disk was also used in several MIDI keyboards and MIDI samplers of the mid-1980s. A non-inclusive list includes: the Roland S-10 and MKS100 samplers, the Korg SQD1, the Korg SQD8 MIDI sequencer, Akai's 1985 model MD280 drive for the S-612 MIDI sampler, Akai's X7000 / S700 (rack version) and X3700, the Roland S-220, and the Yamaha MDF1 MIDI disk drive (intended for their DX7/21/100/TX7 synthesizers, RX11/21/21L drum machines, and QX1, QX21 and QX5 MIDI sequencers). As the cost in the 1980s to add -inch drives was still quite high, the Mitsumi Quick Disk was competing as a lower cost alternative packaged in several now obscure 8-bit computer systems. Another non-inclusive list of Quick Disk versions: QDM-01, QDD (Quick Disk Drive) on French Thomson micro-computers, in the Casio QD-7 drive, in a peripheral for the Sharp MZ-700 & MZ-800 system, in the DPQ-280 Quickdisk for the Daewoo/Dynadata MSX1 DPC-200, in the Dragon 32/64 machine, in the Crescent Quick Disk 128, 128i and 256 peripherals for the ZX Spectrum, and in the Triton Quick Disk peripheral also for the ZX Spectrum. The World of Spectrum FAQ reveals that the drives did come in different sizes: 128 to 256 kB in Crescent's incarnation, and in the Triton system, with a density of 4410 bits per inch, data transmission rate of 101.6 kbit/s, a 2.8-inch double sided disk type and a capacity of up to 20 sectors per side at 2.5 kB per sector, up to 100 kB per disk. Quick Disk as used in the Famicom Disk System holds 64 kB of data per side, requiring a manual turn-over to access the second side. Unusually, the Quick Disk utilizes \\"a continuous linear tracking of the head and thus creates a single spiral track along the disk similar to a record groove.\\" This has led some to compare it more to a \\"tape-stream\\" unit than typically what is thought of as a random-access disk drive.  -inch format  Close-up of -inch disk Standard -inch disk with a blank label In 1981, Sony introduced their -inch floppy disk cartridge (90.0 mm √ó 94.0 mm) having a single sided unformatted capacity of 218.8 KB and a formatted capacity of 161.2 KB. A double sided version was available in 1982. This initial Sony design was similar to other less than -inch designs but somewhat simpler in construction. The first computer to use this format was Sony's SMC 70 of 1982. Other than Hewlett-Packard's HP-150 of 1983 and Sony's MSX computers that year, this format suffered from a similar fate as the other new formats; the -inch format simply had too much market share. Things changed dramatically in 1982 when the Microfloppy Industry Committee (MIC), a consortium ultimately of 23 media companies, agreed upon a -inch media specification based upon but differing from the original Sony design.\\"The Microfloppy‚ÄîOne Key to Portability,\\" Thomas R. Jarrett, Computer Technology Review, Winter 1983 (Jan 1984), pp 245-247 The first single-sided drives compatible with this new media specification shipped in early 1983,1983 DISK/TREND REPORT, , FLEXIBLE DISK DRIVES followed immediately in 1984 by double-sided compatible versions. In 1984, Apple Computer selected the format for their new Macintosh computers. Then, in 1985, Atari adopted it for their new ST line, and Commodore for their new Amiga. By 1988, the -inch was outselling the -inch.1991 DISK/TREND REPORT, FLEXIBLE DISK DRIVES, Figure 2 In South Africa, the -inch format was generally called a stiffy disk, to distinguish it from the flexible 5¬Ω-inch format. The term \\"-inch\\" or \\"3.5-inch\\" disk is and was rounded from the 90 mm actual dimension of one side of the rectangular cartridge. The actual disk diameter is . The -inch disks had, by way of their rigid case's slide-in-place metal cover, the significant advantage of being much better protected against unintended physical contact with the disk surface than -inch disks when the disk was handled outside the disk drive. When the disk was inserted, a part inside the drive moved the metal cover aside, giving the drive's read/write heads the necessary access to the magnetic recording surfaces. Adding the slide mechanism resulted in a slight departure from the previous square outline. The irregular, rectangular shape had the additional merit that it made it impossible to insert the disk sideways by mistake as had indeed been possible with earlier formats. 3.5\\" drives included several other advantages over the older drive types, including not requiring a terminating resistor pack, and no need of an index hole. The shutter mechanism was not without its problems, however. On old or roughly treated disks, the shutter could bend away from the disk. This made it vulnerable to being ripped off completely (which does not damage the disk itself but does leave it much more vulnerable to dust), or worse, catching inside a drive and possibly either getting stuck inside or damaging the drive. = Evolution = Like the -inch, the -inch disk underwent an evolution of its own. When Apple introduced the Macintosh in 1984, it used single-sided -inch disk drives with an advertised capacity of 400 kB. The encoding technique used by these drives was known as GCR, or Group Coded Recording (similar recording methods were used by Commodore on its -inch drives and Sirius Systems Technology in its Victor 9000 non-PC-compatible MS- DOS machine). ;Higher capacities Somewhat later, PC-compatible machines began using single-sided -inch disks with an advertised capacity of 360 kB (the same as a double-sided -inch disk), and a different, incompatible recording format called MFM (Modified Frequency Modulation). GCR and MFM drives (and their formatted disks) were incompatible, although the physical disks were the same. In 1986, Apple introduced double-sided, 800 kB disks, still using GCR, and soon after, IBM began using 720 kB double-sided double-density MFM disks in PCs like the IBM PC Convertible. IBM PC compatibles adopted it too, while the Amiga used MFM encoding on the same disks to give a capacity of 1 MB (880 KB available once formatted). ;HD An MFM-based, \\"high-density\\" format, displayed as \\"HD\\" on the disks themselves and typically advertised as \\"1.44 MB\\" was introduced in 1987; the most common formatted capacity was 1,474,560 bytes.i.e. IBM's format of 512 bytes/sector * 2,880 sectors/disk = 1,474,560 bytes per disk. Other formats could have somewhat more or less capacity available. These HD disks had an extra hole in the case on the opposite side of the write-protect notch. IBM used this format on their PS/2 series introduced in 1987. Apple started using \\"HD\\" in 1988, on the Macintosh IIx, and the HD floppy drive soon became universal on virtually all Macintosh and PC hardware. Apple's FDHD (Floppy Disk High Density) drive was capable of reading and writing both GCR and MFM formatted disks, and thus made it relatively easy to exchange files with PC users. Apple later marketed this drive as the SuperDrive.Apple began using the SuperDrive brand name again in 2001 to denote their unrelated all-formats CD/DVD reader/writer. Amiga included \\"HD\\" floppy drives relatively late, with releasing of Amiga 4000 in 1992, and was able to store 1760 KB on it, with ability in software to read/write PC's 1440 KB/720 KB formats. ;ED Another advance in the oxide coatings allowed for a new \\"extra-high density\\" (\\"ED\\") format at 2880 KB introduced on the NeXTcube, NeXTstation and IBM PS/2 model 57. However, by this time the increased capacity was too small an advance over the HD format and it never became widely used.

Initially, the team had a partnership with Doyle Racing using the name Doyle-Risi Racing, but soon Giuseppe Risi took full control of the project and it was rebranded with its current name in 2000. Risi Competizione has won races and championships in the IMSA GT championship, American Le Mans Series, and Rolex Sports Car Series, as well as earning three class wins at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in , and . Much of Risi Competizione's success has come through the use of Ferrari machines. Racing history Risi Competizione was initially created as a competition arm of Ferrari of Houston, a car dealership owned by Giuseppe Risi. Doyle Racing, wishing to replace their outdated Riley & Scott sports prototype, was able to use Risi's connection to Ferrari to purchase two new Ferrari 333 SPs. Risi in turn was able to promote his Houston dealership. The first of the team's 333 SPs was planned for use in the IMSA GT Championship, while the second was kept in Europe to prepare for the 24 Hours of Le Mans, to which the team had already been invited due to the success of Doyle Racing the previous year in IMSA. One of a pair of Lola B2K/40-Nissans which Risi Competizione ran for Rand Racing in 2002 Under the Maserati Corse name, Risi ran a Maserati MC12 in the GT1 class of the American Le Mans Series. The new partnership was able to quickly find success as the team won in only the second race of the season, drivers Wayne Taylor and Eric van de Poele earning victory at Las Vegas Motor Speedway. In Europe for Le Mans, Taylor and Van de Poele were joined by Ferm√≠n V√©lez, and although they were unable to win the race overall, they scored victory in their class with an eighth-place finish. Back in the United States, Doyle-Risi earned their third victory of the year at the inaugural Petit Le Mans at Road Atlanta, winning the race overall against several teams they had competed against at Le Mans. With two victories for the year, Doyle-Risi won the team championship for the World Sports Car class, while Taylor was second and Van de Poele third in the drivers' championship. Doyle-Risi opened the 1999 season by competing in the 24 Hours of Daytona, finishing the race in second place and only two laps behind the race winner. Doyle-Risi followed this by joining the American Le Mans Series, a replacement for the previous year's IMSA GT Championship. Both of their 333 SPs were entered for the full season. However, facing stiffer competition from Audi, BMW and Panoz, the team was unable to score any victories over the year, although they did score a season-best result of fourth at the Grand Prix of Atlanta. The team finished the season fourth in the LMP championship. Giuseppe Risi took full control of the team in 2000, rebranding it as Risi Competizione, and retained one of the 333 SPs from Doyle. Ralf Kelleners and Mimmo Schiattarella were signed, and Risi moved to the new Rolex Sports Car Series. The team earned two second- place finishes and scored fourth in the team championship. Schiattarella earned fourth in the drivers' championship, while Kelleners was sixth. In 2001, Risi entered a sole 333 SP at the 24 Hours of Daytona but failed to finish, and the team chose to not compete for the rest of the season. During Risi's year away from competition, the company began development work on a competition version of the 360 Modena for Ferrari. Although busy with development, Risi agreed to a partnership with Rand Racing to run a pair of Nissan-powered Lola B2K/40 prototypes in the SRPII class of the Rolex Sports Car Series in 2002. The Rand-Risi team swept the ten-race season, winning their class in every event and clinching the championships. Meanwhile, Risi's 360 debuted in two of the final rounds of the American Le Mans Series season, earning podiums in their class for both races. For 2003, Risi's 360 was entered in the Daytona 24 Hours and earned second place overall, beating multiple faster prototypes. The team then moved permanently to the American Le Mans Series, running a pair of the new 360s. The team earned second place in their class championship, while Risi Competizione also returned to the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the first time since their 1998 victory, finishing in 27th place. Risi continued their development of the 360 Modena into 2004, eventually upsetting the series' Porsche dominance with a victory in their class at the New England Grand Prix. Difficulties in completing races, however, led the team to eventually finish the year fifth in the championship. A Ferrari F430 GT2 campaigned by Risi Competizione in the 2007 American Le Mans Series season. The F430 of Harrison Brix and Patrick Friesacher during the 2008 Grand Prix of Long Beach Now that their development of the 360 Modena was completed, Risi Competizione was chosen by Ferrari in 2005 to campaign another new car in the American Le Mans Series, this time the MC12 for Ferrari's sister brand Maserati. Running under the Maserati Corse name, the team earned several third-place finishes in their GT1 class, but due to the MC12 not complying with certain ACO & ALMS rules, the team was not able to be awarded any points in the class championship. The team returned to the GT2 class in 2006 running a replacement for the 360 Modena, the F430. Assigned factory Ferrari drivers Mika Salo and Jaime Melo, Risi Competizione earned four victories and eventually earned the team championship, although Salo finished ninth in the drivers' championship. Risi improved over the next season, earning eight victories out of the twelve races in the American Le Mans Series, including the 12 Hours of Sebring. The team once again secured the team championship, while Salo and Melo share the drivers' championship. Both F430s also attended the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the third time in the team's history, where a car used in partnership with Krohn Racing finished 17th overall and second in the GT2 class. For Risi Competizione's 2008 campaign in the American Le Mans Series, two F430s were once again in use. The team's primary car is once again piloted by defending champions Salo and Melo. The second car is used in partnership with Krohn Racing for several races during the season, but driven by Patrick Friesacher and Harrison Brix for the remainder of the events. The Risi team finished 3rd in the ALMS GT2 championship behind Krohn Racing and Flying Lizard Motorsports with Salo and Melo finishing 7th in the drivers championship. Risi also entered the 24 Hours of Le Mans for the second year in a row, entering a Salo and Melo along with Ferrari factory driver Gianmaria Bruni in their primary car, while Krohn Racing used Tracy Krohn, Niclas J√∂nsson, and Eric van de Poele in their cooperative entry. Although the Krohn entry was the first retirement of the race, the main Risi entry went on to take the GT2 class victory, 19th overall. This marked their second victory at Le Mans in four attempts. Risi kicked off the 2009 American Le Mans Series season with a GT2 class win at the 12 Hours of Sebring. Continuing competition with drivers Mika Salo and Jaime Melo. Pierre Kaffer would join the team for the longer rounds. Risi would face fierce competition all season long ending the season with only one other win at the 2009 Petit Le Mans round. With those two wins, and many strong finishes, Risi would finish 2nd in the championship behind Flying Lizard Motorsports with 137 points. For their third straight year, Risi Competizione received an invitationhttp://www.motorsport.com/alms/news/aco-prepares- for-2009-le-mans-with-first-invites/ and would compete in the 2009 24 Hours of Le Mans using the same driver lineup from their ALMS entry. Risi's F430 would once again overcome its rivals and take home the GT2 class victory with an 18th overall finish. Krohn Racing's F430 entered in partnership with Risi would finish 3rd in the GT2 class and 22nd overall. In 2014, Risi competed in the GTLM class of the newly created United SportsCar Championship, running a Ferrari 458 Italia GTLM driven by Giancarlo Fisichella and Pierre Kaffer. They took class victories at Road America and Virginia, finishing the championship in 6th in GTLM with 298 points. The following year they continued to run with the same car and drivers in the 2015 United SportsCar Championship. They failed to pick up any class wins, finishing in 4th place in GTLM in the championship with 295 points. In 2016, Risi used the new Ferrari 488 GTE in the WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with a driver lineup of Giancarlo Fisichella and Toni Vilander, scoring a class win in the season finale at Petit Le Mans and finishing 5th in the championship standings. Risi once again entered the famous 24 Hours of Le Mans race where they were joined by Matteo Malucelli. The team finished second in their class. Risi started the 2017 season in the IMSA WeatherTech SportsCar Championship with the same drivers and the same car. They repeated their Le Mans entry but failed to finish after being hit by a competitor from another class. After the 24 Hours of Le Mans, they temporarily withdrew from the IMSA series. In 2019 Risi made only 3 races, scoring a GTLM win at Petit Le Mans with Alessandro Pier Guidi, James Calado and Daniel Serra, and a runner-up finish at the 24 Hours of Daytona. They raced also the 24 Hours of Le Mans. In October they went on to win the GTLM class in the MOTUL Petit Le Mans using the 2019 Le Mans winning crew.

The True Tragedy of Richard III is an anonymous Elizabethan history play on the subject of Richard III of England. It has attracted the attention of scholars of English Renaissance drama principally for the question of its relationship with William Shakespeare‚Äôs Richard III. The title spelling that appears on the cover page of the quarto is The True Tragedie of Richard the third. The True Tragedy of Richard III should not be confused with The True Tragedy of Richard, Duke of York; the latter is the early alternative version of Shakespeare's Henry VI, Part 3. Publication The play was entered into the Stationers' Register on 19 June 1594; it appeared in print later that year, in a quarto printed and published by Thomas Creede and sold by the stationer William Barley, \\"at his shop in Newgate Market, near Christ Church door.\\" In addition to Creede's 1594 quarto, another edition of the play was \\"Printed at London by W.W. for Thomas Millington and are to be sold at his shoppe under Saint Peters Church in Cornewall, 1600.\\" FacsimilePublisher.com This is likely Cornhill; \\"under' meaning below, since it is on a hill. No further editions are known prior to the nineteenth century. E. K. Chambers, The Elizabethan Stage, 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 4, p. 43. Only three copies of the play are known to have survived, all of which are now in the US.WW Greg, The True Tragedy of Richard III, Great Britain, The Malone Society Reprints, 1929; pp. v One copy can be found in the Carl Pforzheimer library at the Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas, one is at the Folger Shakespeare Library in Washington, D.C., and the third can be found in the Huntington Library in California. W. W. Greg prepared a modern edition of the play for the Malone Society; it was published in 1929 primarily from the Pforzheimer copy. Date \\"The question of date is confused and unsettled.\\"Logan and Smith, p. 273. Most scholars and critics, relying on internal clues in the text, have estimated a date of authorship within a year or two of 1590, though dates as early as c. 1585 have also been posited.Chambers, Vol. 4, pp. 43-4; Logan and Smith, pp. 273-4. The title page of the 1594 quarto states that the play was acted by The Queen Majesties Players. The title page of the 1600 quarto states that the play was acted \\"sundry\\" times by the \\"Right Honourable the Earle of Pembrooke his servantes\\". Any date of authorship for The True Tragedy in the mid-to-late 1580s to the early 1590s would be compatible with performance by the Queen's Men. Critics generally judge the author of The True Tragedy to have been influenced by Thomas Legge's Latin play Richardus Tertius (c. 1580) ‚Äî though that relationship is of little help in dating the True Tragedy. Sources and Genre Apart from the question of Richardus Tertius, the author of The True Tragedy relied upon the standard historical sources of his generation for the story of Richard ‚Äî principally Edward Hall's chronicle on the Wars of the Roses, and the chronicle by John Hardyng later continued by Richard Grafton. While The True Tragedy clearly belongs to the genre of the Elizabethan history play, some critics have also pointed out its relationship with the revenge tragedy. Authorship There is no external attribution of authorship for The True Tragedy; and the question of authorship is complicated by the fact that the single text of the play, the 1594 quarto, is notably inferior. Modern critics have tended to treat it as a bad quarto and a \\"reported text.\\" Individual commentators have nominated Christopher Marlowe, Thomas Lodge, George Peele, and Thomas Kyd, among other writers of their generation, as possible authors or revisers of the play; but no scholarly consensus in favour of any single candidate or hypothesis has evolved.Logan and Smith, pp. 272-3; Chambers, Vol. 4, p. 44.

Critics are not unanimous on the view that Shakespeare used The True Tragedy as a source for his play, though the majority tend to favour this judgement. Geoffrey Bullough treats The True Tragedy as a \\"probable source\\" for Richard III, citing several commonalities (as when, in both plays, Richard calls for a horse on Bosworth Field (1485), yet refuses to flee the battle) ‚Äî though Bullough admits that the nature of the plays' relationship is \\"not clear.\\"Geoffrey Bullough, ed., Narrative and Dramatic Sources of Shakespeare, Vol. 3; New York, Columbia University Press, 1960; pp. 237-9, 317-45. The uncertainty in dating has allowed a few commentators to propose a reversed priority, and to argue that the author (or reviser) of The True Tragedy may have borrowed from Shakespeare's play.Logan and Smith, p. 276. Shakespeare appears to have known of The True Tragedy, since he paraphrases it in Hamlet, III,ii,254, \\"the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.\\" Line 1892 in The True Tragedy reads \\"The screeking raven sits croking for revenge.\\" Unlike Shakespeare, \\"The True Tragedy\\" has no act or scene division.

The book is a firsthand account of Beah's time as a child soldier during the civil war in Sierra Leone (1990s). Beah was 12 years old when he fled his village after it was attacked by rebels, and he wandered the war-filled country until brainwashed by an army unit that forced him to use guns and drugs. By 13, he had perpetrated and witnessed numerous acts of violence. Three years later, UNICEF rescued him from the unit and put him into a rehabilitation program that helped him find his uncle, who would eventually adopt him. After his return to civilian life he began traveling the United States recounting his story. Main character list Ishmael Beah: At the beginning of the book, he is a young boy whose parents are separated and loves performing rap with his elder brother and friends. After armed forces attack his home village, he, his brother, and friends are left orphans and wander around seeking shelter. Ishmael is eventually claimed as a child soldier for the Sierra Leone Armed Forces at age 13. After being rescued by UNICEF at 16, he is rehabilitated and begins to live with his Uncle Tommy. While there, he is recruited to travel to the United States to speak at a United Nations event about child soldiers. Returning to Freetown after his speaking event, he eventually made his way back to the United States. After a time, he was able to forgive himself and love once again. Junior Beah: Ishmael's older brother by one year. He is eventually separated from Ishmael during the attack on the village of Kamator, where they were seeking refuge in. Alhaji: One of Ishmael's closest friends. Alhaji was part of the group of boys from Mattru Jong that Ishmael met in the wilderness. Alhaji and Ishmael formed a close bond during their years as soldiers and were part of the same squad. Alhaji was nicknamed \\"Little Rambo\\" for his combat skills that were heavily influenced by the film. Alhaji and Ishmael were eventually taken by UNICEF and put into a rehabilitation shelter in Freetown. He apparently moved from foster home to foster home following the events of the book. Kanei, Musa, Saidu, Jumah, Alhaji, and Moriba: Ishmael's friends from his home village whom he meets in the wilderness after being separated from his initial group. Saidu is the first of the group to die; he dies suddenly two nights after he and the other boys eat a crow that fell from the sky. Kanei is the oldest of the group by three years, although Alhaji is confused as being older because he is taller. He becomes a junior sergeant and later is chosen to stay behind because he is older while Alhaji and Ishmael are sent to rehabilitation. It is unknown what happens to him. Musa is the group's storyteller. He is killed in the first battle that Ishmael and his squad fight in. Jumah and Moriba also become part of the army. Jumah is assigned to another squad in a different village and is last seen preparing for another village raid. Moriba is killed in a fight sometime during Ishmael's time as a soldier. Talloi, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou: Ishmael's initial traveling companions. Talloi is Junior's friend and follows them to Mattru Jong for the contest. The three meet up with old friends, Gibrilla, Kaloko, and Khalilou there. They escape the attack of Mattru Jong by RUF forces, but are later split apart by another attack in a different village. Ishmael found Kaloko hiding as well, but Beah subsequently left him once he grew tired of hiding, and Kaloko was unwilling to follow him. It is unknown what happened to the four boys. Uncle Tommy: Ishmael's Uncle. Uncle Tommy is a carpenter with three kids and a wife, all of whom welcome Ishmael as their new brother. They all love Ishmael irrevocably, and unconditionally. Uncle Tommy and his wife are the only ones who know about Ishmael's past. However, they forgive him and take him in as their own son right away. Ishmael truly feels like he belongs when he is with them. Uncle Tommy later dies of sickness. Esther: A nurse at the shelter whom Ishmael develops a friendship with. Ishmael tells parts of his war stories and dreams to Esther and soon comes to fully trust her. Esther gives Ishmael a Walkman with a Run‚ÄìD.M.C. cassette and later buys him a Bob Marley cassette. Esther does regular check-ups on Ishmael's mental health during his period of rehabilitation at Benin Home. Ishmael admits that he loves her, but never sees her again after he leaves Freetown. Mambu: Another child soldier with the Sierra Leone Armed Forces. Mambu and Ishmael meet at the shelter for the first time. They become close friends. He later goes back to the front lines after his family rejects him. Mohamed: Ishmael's best friend from his home village, whom Ishmael is reunited with at the UNICEF rehabilitation center where Ishmael has already been for several months. Mohamed was meant to go with Ishmael to the talent show in the beginning of the story but had to stay behind to help his father work. Plot summary =Before the RUF attack= The book starts with Ishmael Beah, his older brother Junior, and their friend Talloi traveling from their village of Mogbwemo to Mattru Jong in order to perform in a talent show. Ishmael, Junior, and their friend dance and sing rap music. Thinking they would return the following day, they tell no one of their leaving. =RUF attacks and flight= During their stay in Mattru Jong with Gibrilla, Khalilou, and Kaloko, the RUF attacks. The three are able to flee the village without the rebels following them. They decide to head back home. On the way, it turns out that their village was also captured by the RUF. According to an old man who was sitting outside the village, most of the people had fled to a village on the Sierra Leone coast. Ishmael, Junior, and their friend decide to travel there in order to locate their families. On their way, they encounter multiple other villages. They are accepted into another village on the grounds that they help with the farming. After months, the village is attacked. Caught by surprise, Ishmael, Junior, and their friend split up and run into the swamps. It is unknown what happens to his friends afterwards. Ishmael roams around the wilderness by himself for a while, until he meets up with another group of traveling boys whom he recognizes from his home village. The boys then travel together to another village on the coast. Many refugees fled to this village because the Sierra Leone Armed Forces occupied it. In search of safety, the group of boys and Ishmael go to that village, but soon leave. Ishmael then learns from a woman from his hometown that Junior, his younger brother Ibrahim, and his parents are safe in another village with many others from Mattru Jong. Just before they reach the village, the boys meet a man named Gasemu whom Ishmael knew from Mattru Jong. Gasemu tells them that Ishmael's family are indeed safe in the village, and ask the boys to help him carry bananas back to that village. However, moments before they reach the town, it is attacked by the RUF. Although their bodies are not found among the dead or in the burning house where they lived, Ishmael assumes that his family is dead. Devastated, and believing that Gasemu is to blame for his not being able to see his family on time, Ishmael attacks Gasemu but is stopped by the other boys. They are then chased into the forest by remaining RUF soldiers, and Gasemu dies from being shot, leaving Ishmael more saddened. =Recruitment and life as a child soldier= The boys then settle into another village protected by the army. After many uneventful days, the lieutenant in charge of the troops in the village announced that the RUF was beginning to assault the village. The lieutenant said that in order for the people to survive, they must contribute to the war effort by enlisting in the army; escape was not an option. By doing this, the lieutenant secures many child soldiers, the weapon of choice for both the RUF and the Sierra Leone Armed Forces. Ishmael becomes a junior lieutenant for his skill in executing prisoners of war and is put in charge of a small group of other child soldiers. As a child soldier Ishmael is exposed to extreme violence and drug usage. The drugs he used are described in the book as \\"brown brown\\", \\"white pills\\", cocaine, and marijuana. =Rescue and rehabilitation= In January 1996, during one of the roll calls, a group of men wearing UNICEF shirts round up several boys and takes them to a shelter in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown, where they and several other child soldiers are to be rehabilitated. However, the children cause much trouble for the volunteer staffers at the facility, with Ishmael experiencing symptoms of drug withdrawal as well as troubling memories of his time as a child soldier. Despite the violence caused by the children, one of the staffers, Nurse Esther, becomes interested in Ishmael, learning about his childhood love of rap music and purchasing him a rap cassette and Walkman, when she takes Ishmael and his friend Alhaji to the city. It is through this connection and his numerous counseling experiences with Esther that Ishmael eventually turns away from his violent self and starts to heal from his mental wounds. =Adoption= Eventually, Ishmael becomes adopted by his Uncle Tommy in the city and settles down with him and his family on the outskirts of Freetown. It is during this time that Ishmael is chosen to speak to the United Nations (UN) in New York City about his experiences as a child soldier and the other problems plaguing his country. While at the UN meeting, Ishmael met several other children who were also experiencing problems in their countries. There were 57 children present at the meeting, and each told his or her story to the UN. Ishmael also meets Laura Simms, his chaperone, who is a storyteller and his future foster mother. =Return to Sierra Leone and flight abroad= In 1996, when Ishmael returns to Sierra Leone, Freetown is invaded by a combination of the RUF and the Sierra Leonean government army, causing many civilian deaths, including the death of Uncle Tommy from malady. Believing that he can no longer stay in Freetown for fear of either becoming a soldier again or of being killed by his former army friends if he refused, Ishmael decides to get in contact with Laura Simms. He then escapes Sierra Leone and crosses the border into Guinea, where he eventually makes his way to the United States and his new life abroad. Awards and recognition A Long Way Gone was nominated for a Quill Award in the Best Debut Author category for 2007. Time magazine's Lev Grossman named it one of the Top 10 Nonfiction Books of 2007, ranking it at No. 3, and praising it as \\"painfully sharp\\", and its ability to take \\"readers behind the dead eyes of the child-soldier in a way no other writer has.\\" The book was also included in Amazon's 100 books to read in a lifetime list.Amazon, 100 books to read in a lifetime, https://www.amazon.com/100books Accuracy dispute In 2009, The Australian reported that aspects of Beah's account of his life story did not match other evidence. The report claimed that Beah's village was destroyed in 1995 rather than 1993, and that given the more compressed time frame, he could not have been a soldier for more than a couple of months, rather than the years that he describes in his book. He would also have been aged 15 when he became a soldier, rather than 13. Questions were also raised about Beah's description of a battle between child soldiers at a UNICEF camp, in which 6 people were said to have been killed. Witnesses interviewed by The Australian said that such an event in a UNICEF camp would have drawn significant attention in Sierra Leone, but no independent verification of such a battle could be obtained. Investigations by other publications also failed to discover other evidence of such a battle, and UNICEF, while supportive of Beah in general, also said that it had not been able to verify this aspect of his story.Michael Clancy, \\"UNICEF Cannot Confirm Beah's Camp Brawl Claim\\", Village Voice,, March 19, 2008. The Australian's claims were subsequently denied in a statement issued by Beah, in which he called into question the reliability of the sources quoted. The statement also cited the fact that during the early stages of its research, the newspaper had investigated the possibility that Beah's father was still alive, a possibility that was based on mistaken identity by an Australian mining engineer. The Australian's published articles stated that they had established that the man in question was not Beah's father. Beah's adoptive mother also reaffirmed her belief in the validity of the dates, quoting two Sierra Leonean sources who corroborated the chronology of events given in his book.Beah defends books against charges of lies ‚Äì 1/23/2008 However, the publisher amended this statement after The Australian objected that it seriously misrepresented the newspaper's report. The source cited by the publisher, Leslie Mboka, National Chairman of the Campaign for Just Mining, was in fact quoted by The Australian. The newspaper quoted him as saying that Beah \\"was a young child who had been through terrible things so he could easily have got things mixed up.\\" Mboka, when subsequently contacted by the publisher, reported to them that he had vigorously supported Beah's chronology when interviewed by The Australian, and had challenged the paper for bias. However, Mboka had not met Beah until after the disputed events had taken place, and so was unable to provide firsthand verification of his account.Graham Rayman, \\"Boy Soldier of Fortune\\", Village Voice, March 18, 2008. The other correction involved the newspaper's publication, not of Beah's foster-mother's address but of her publicly listed website address; hate mail had indeed been received, but via the Internet. While the publisher made note of these, it stood by the accuracy of the book.The Book Standard is closed The dispute over Beah's credibility arose at a time when the exposure of some \\"fictional\\" memoirs, such as Margaret Seltzer's account of growing up in a Los Angeles crime gangMotoko Rich, \\"Gang Memoir, Turning Page, Is Pure Fiction\\", The New York Times, March 4, 2008. and James Frey's account of drug addiction, had led to debate over the nature of the genre. The controversy was followed up in international publications including the British Sunday Times,Bryan Appleyard's full account of his interview with Ishmael Beah, Times Online. Slate,Gabriel Sherman, \\"The feud over Ishmael Beah's child-soldier memoir, A Long Way Gone\\", Slate Magazine. and the Village Voice. Beah had claimed to have a \\"photographic memory\\", which enabled him to have perfect recall of the events he described, leaving him \\"less room to maneuver\\" than if he had allowed room for human error. However, some of his defenders as well as his critics allowed for the possibility that his account was not entirely accurate, stating that the main point was that he had drawn attention to an issue that was of vital importance. Possible explanations for any inaccuracies include the trauma of war as experienced by a young child, the drug use described in his account, and the possibility that Beah was tacitly encouraged by outsiders to compile stories from multiple sources into a singular autobiographical account. Despite the detailed descriptions that Beah provided in terms of the people he killed and the violence he engaged in; he makes no references of personally engaging in sexual violence. In fact, Beah makes little reference to witnessing rape throughout his memoir which is unusual considering the overwhelming evidence that systematic rape was used as a tool of war in Sierra Leone at the time. Various international reports confirm that while Beah was a child soldier, rape was commonly used within armed conflicts. It is possible, however, that Beah downplayed discussions of rape due to external pressures that threaten persecution; on September 15, 2000, the government of Sierra Leone ratified the Rome Statute in the International Criminal Court (ICC) acknowledging systematic rape as amounting to a crime against humanity. This is significant because Beah published his memoirs in 2007, and therefore was at risk of being charged with international war crimes by the United Nations (UN). The 1999 Peace Agreement (Lom√© Peace Agreement) in Sierra Leone was overseen by the UN and it was pronounced that amnesty would not be granted to anyone found guilty of serious violations to International Human Rights Law, including anything that amounts to Crimes Against Humanity. Therefore, Beah was at risk of international legal repercussions if he admitted to engaging in wartime rape and other forms of violence against women. Neil Boothby, an academic who has undertaken extensive research into children and war, said that while all of the atrocities described by Beah have occurred at various points, it would be highly unusual for one child to have experienced them all. Boothby criticized the mentality that provided attention only to those with the most horrific stories to tell, thus encouraging exaggeration. \\"I've seen it over and over. Whether by psychologists or journalists, they are encouraged to tell the sensational stories...The system is set up to reward sensational stories. We all need to look at why does something have to be so horrific before we open our eyes and ears and hearts?\\" See also * Children of War (2010), documentary by Bryan Single * P. W.

The newspaper, under his leadership, also called for a boycott of Jewish businesses already in 1931.√Ñu√üerungen gegen Hitler und deren Folgen (in German) accessed: 28 June 2008 = Nazi era = Vehicle insignia for a Gauleiter Wahl became Gauleiter of Swabia on 1 October 1928 and held this position until the end of the Second World War in Europe in May 1945, when the Gaue were abolished. Originally, the office of Gauleiter was purely a party office, but with the Nazi Machtergreifung in January 1933, the position became much more an administrative one and by 1934, the Bavarian Gauleiters had supplanted the still existing office of Minister President of Bavaria as the leading administrative authorities in the state.Gauleiter (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 28 June 2008 Additionally, Wahl also held the office of Regierungspr√§sident (District President) the Head of Government of Swabia, from 1 July 1934. He thus united under his control the highest party and governmental offices in his jusisdiction, like most other Gauleiters. In Swabia, a relatively small Gau, the local Gauleiter Wahl had to initially fend off attempts by his more powerful neighbor, Adolf Wagner, Gauleiter of the Munich-Upper Bavaria region, to incorporate Swabia into his Gau.Gau (NSDAP) - Kontinuit√§t der Gaugliederung nach 1933 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 Wahl was the only one of the Bavarian Gauleiter not to have graduated from university.Gauleiter - Die bayrischen Gauleiter nach 1933 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 Unlike Wagner, who was a personal friend of Hitler, Wahl wielded no real influence with the party leadership. The Gauleiter was directly appointed by Hitler and only answerable to him. In practice, Hitler interfered little in the affairs of the local leaders and their power was almost absolute.Die NS- Gaue (in German) Deutsches Historisches Museum website, accessed: 25 June 2008 Wahl joined the SS and was promoted to SS-Gruppenf√ºhrer on 9 September 1934. In his time as Gauleiter, Wahl, raised a Protestant but married to a Roman Catholic, enjoyed good relations with the church, something not appreciated within the higher party ranks, especially by Himmler and Bormann. The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919-1945 google book review, page 230, author: Richard Steigmann-Gall, publisher: Cambridge University Press, accessed: 28 June 2008 He nevertheless held a close friendship to Auxiliary Bishop Franz Xaver Eberle (1874-1951) of Augsburg throughout the time of the Third Reich and Hitler himself complimented Wahl in 1937, saying \\"Wahl, your auxiliary bishop is the most sympathetic priest that I have ever met\\".A Question of Resistance: The Catholic Church in the Third Reich book review, author: Georg Denzler, publisher: Pendo Verlag, accessed: 29 June 2008 On 12 July 1938, Wahl presided over the annexation of Jungholz and the Kleinwalsertal to the Gau Schwaben. Both communities had previously been part of Austria but could only be reached overland from Swabia. Both were returned to Austria in September 1945.Jahrhundert ‚Äì R√ºckblick (in German) Kleinwalsertal website, accessed: 28 June 2008 With the beginning of the Second World War, Wahl noticed that the excitement within the German population for another war was very limited. Compared to the patriotism he encountered and felt himself in 1914, he now mostly felt people were resigned and stunned in the face of another conflict.Presselenkung im Dritten Reich - Die propagandistische Vorbereitung des √úberfalls auf Polen (in German) Historic seminar of the University of Bonn, accessed: 28 June 2008 In May 1941, he gave a rather telling speech at the Messerschmitt factory, voicing his belief in Hitler and his mission from God to punish all people and countries which have strayed from the path of decency. He denounced the leaders of many of the countries Germany had defeated as cowards, due to the fact that they fled to England and elsewhere rather than stayed or died with their people and soldiers.BR-Online - Nazi-Ideologie im Original-Ton (in German) accessed: 28 June 2008 A short recording of part of this speech has been preserved. He also spent six weeks with a Swabian mountain division (German:Gebirgsj√§ger) in the Donetsk region.Alternativer Stadtrundgang (in German - with pictures) accessed: 28 June 2008 On 16 November 1942, Wahl was named Reich Defense Commissioner for his Gau.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk. Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen, 1986, p. 377, . He was promoted to SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 1 August 1944. With the worsening war situation, Wahl and the Gau Schwaben came under the military command of Paul Giesler in 1944, who was in charge of Swabia and three of the formerly Austrian Gaue.Gauleiter - Die bayrischen Gauleiter nach 1942 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 He met Hitler for the last time on 25 February 1945 in Berlin. Wahl was well aware then that the war was lost. The latter issued on this occasion in front of a large number of Gauleiter the statement that \\"the German people did not have the inner strength they were perceived to have\\" and therefore were losing the war. Wahl attributed this harsh statement to the stress the F√ºhrer was in and perceived him to be mortally ill. Nevertheless, he could not understand why Hitler continued the war. In the last days of the war, Wahl made no effort to prevent the handover of Augsburg to the allies, knowing full well that the city could not be defended; shortly after he was arrested.Gauleiter - Die bayrischen Gauleiter vor dem Zusammenbruch 1945 (in German) Historisches Lexikon Bayerns, accessed: 25 June 2008 = Post-war = Wahl, Gauleiter of Swabia for almost 17 years, only served a light sentence after the war, being sentenced to 3¬Ω years and loss of all personal funds on 17 December 1948. In this sentence, the 3¬Ω years spent in captivity from April 1945 to September 1948 was credited, meaning he was released without any further time in jail. The majority of his personal funds were later restored to him, losing only 10%.Texte zum Gauleiter von Schwaben, Karl Wahl (in German), accessed: 28 June 2008 He was downgraded from a group-I war criminal to a group-II, which explains the refund of parts of his funds. He was also a witness at the Nuremberg trials in 1946.Nuremberg Trial Proceedings Volume 42 The Avalon Project, accessed: 28 June 2008 After his time in prison, he changed his profession and became a textile merchant. After receiving permission from the denazification authorities, he started writing his autobiography in 1952 and 1953, which was published in Augsburg in 1954. In his book he stated his continuing admiration for Hitler but also his suspicion that Hitler may have realised himself by mid-1944 that Germany had lost the war. Wahl's autobiography was the first of any Gauleiter to be published. He later worked in the library of the Messerschmitt factory from 1958 to 1968, thanks to his friendship with Willy Messerschmitt, established in the Nazi era.Schulchronik: ¬ªSpurensuche¬´. Die j√ºdischen Sch√ºlerinnen und die Zeit des Nationalsozialismus an der Maria-Theresia-Schule Augsburg (in German) His grave in Augsburg-G√∂ggingen, where he is buried together with his wife, carries the message: \\"Do not tire of doing good deeds\\" (German: Werdet nicht m√ºde das Gute zu tun).Augsburg sightseeing (in German) accessed: 28 June 2008  Nazi crimes and the Holocaust  In his book, Wahl claimed, like many Germans and even Nazis, not to have known about the Holocaust. He states that he was approached by soldiers of the Wehrmacht, returning on front leave to Swabia, who told him of the extermination of Jewish people in Eastern Europe. Wahl further says, he contacted a personal friend at the Reichssicherheitshauptamt to enquire whether there was any substance to the rumour and was told it was a lie. He was asked to disclose the names of the soldiers who had approached him. Wahl's own statement after the war was that \\"nobody could be found in Swabia who had personally been harmed by him\\", but makes no reference to the last 500 Jewish citizens of Augsburg, who disappeared in Nazi concentration camps in the years following the Kristallnacht, when the Augsburg Synagogue was destroyed. In The End, Ian Kershaw describes him as \\"one of the less extreme of the Gauleiter\\" who in spite of his seniority (via early party membership) \\"did not stand high in the esteem of Hitler and Bormann\\" and contrasts Wahl's relative apathy towards the regime's exhortations to fight to the last man with the well-documented fanaticism and cruelty of several other Gauleiters. Kershaw points out, however, that Wahl did advocate to Bormann the use of kamikaze-like suicide attacks with bomb-laden aircraft on US supply bridges over the Rhine. Kershaw posits that Wahl could have made such a suggestion as a means of affirming loyalty to the regime in its final months, when reprisals against defeatist sentiment were at their height.  Offices and memberships  Apart from being Gauleiter of Swabia, Wahl also held the following offices and memberships within the Nazi organisation: * Regierungspr√§sident (Head of Government) of Swabia, since 1934 * Reichsverteidigungskommissar (Defence commissioner) of Swabia, 1942 to 1945 * SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer, promoted 1 August 1944 * SA- Obergruppenf√ºhrer * Member of the German Reichstag for Upper Bavaria-Swabia from 12 November 1933 to May 1945 * Member of the Bavarian Landtag 1928 to 1933 * NSDAP-membership number: 9 803 * SS-membership number: 228 017  Decorations  * Iron Cross of 1914 * Honour Cross of the World War 1914/1918 * State medal (Landesorden) * Golden Party Badge (Goldenes Parteiabzeichen) * NSDAP Long Service Award (NSDAP-Dienstauszeichnung) in Gold * Sword of honour of the Reichsf√ºhrer-SS (Ehrendegen des Reichsf√ºhrers SS) * SS Honour Ring (Totenkopfring der SS) Autobiography Wahl published an autobiography in Augsburg in 1954, being the first former Gauleiter to do so after the war: * \\"... es ist das deutsche Herz\\", Erlebnisse und Erkenntnisse eines ehemaligen Gauleiters (\\"...it's the German heart\\", experiences and insights of a former Gauleiter) He also later published a second book in Offenbach am Main in 1973: * Patrioten oder Verbrecher ‚Äì Aus Liebe zu Deutschland: 17 Jahre als Hitlers Gauleiter (Patriot or criminal - for the love of Germany: 17 years as Hitler's Gauleiter), publisher: Orion-Heimreiter-Verlag, See also *List SS- Obergruppenf√ºhrer  References  External links * Picture of Karl Wahl in Gauleiter uniform - Historisches Lexikon Bayerns * Es ist das deutsche Herz Book review of Wahls' autobiography by Der Spiegel, 22 December 1954 * Nazi- Ideologie im Original-Ton: F√ºhrer und Masse Bayerischer Rundfunk - voice recording of Karl Wahl's speech at the Messerschmitt factory in 1941 - length: 70 seconds * Augsburg sightseeing Pictures of places in Augsburg associated with the Nazis and Karl Wahl, including his grave * List of Gaue and Gauleiter - Shoa.de website * Die Gaue der NSDAP * Biografien der Zeitgeschichte > Gauleiter und Reichsstatthalter - Kurzbiografien Short biographies of the Nazi Gauleiter Category:1892 births Category:1982 deaths Category:People from Aalen Category:People from the Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg Category:German Protestants Category:Nazi Party politicians Category:Gauleiters Category:Members of the Reichstag of Nazi Germany Category:SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer Category:Nazis who served in World War I Category:Military personnel of Bavaria Category:Recipients of the Iron Cross (1914), 1st class Category:Nazis convicted of crimes ","title":"Karl Wahl"},{"id":"18172222","text":"Anderaccha is a town in southwestern Ethiopia.

Ain's innovative design has been called \\"a model for effective use of limited space for low- cost urban housing.\\" Members Of the ten original members of the cooperative, at least four were blacklisted or questioned by the House Un- American Activities Committee, leading to the conclusion that the project was \\"a cooperative living experiment for a group of communists.\\" Resident and architect Richard Corsini noted: \\"Most of the people that originally lived here were path-breaking political types,\\" and even after the communist cooperative broke up, the structures remained popular with progressive homeowners. (The claim that the units were originally built for a group of motion picture cartoonists and their families is not correct, but applies instead to Ain's Community Homes project of the same period.) Architecture Avenel Homes consists of ten identical three-bedroom units of , situated on two lots, each deep. The units are organized in two rows of five, attached, and stepping back from the street in a saw-tooth pattern. This configuration gives each unit a front door and a private back patio. Though small, the unit- plan was noteworthy for its flexibility and openness. It included a sliding wall between the master bedroom and living room, and another between the two smaller bedrooms. Ain's original plan for an 'open' kitchen was rejected by the Federal Housing Administration. In 2002, the Los Angeles Times ran a 1,500-word feature article about the Avenel project. At that time, one of three remaining original residents, Serril Gerber, told the Times that he and his wife had joined with nine other couples in seeking out Ain, hiring him to build a low-cost complex with a high quality of design. Gerber said, \\"We'd seen these modern houses in magazines, and we liked the idea of having a living space that is both indoors and outdoors. We liked the idea of doing something really modern, and we liked Greg. He was a radical person in his thinking, because he wanted to put his ideas in the service of regular people. That was his mission, really.\\" Each couple contributed $11,000 to the project. Modifications and restoration Over the years, the units had been substantially modified by homeowners, and all but one had expanded the living space to include the outdoor patio area. Also, though built for families of four, most owners had found the units more comfortable for two persons and had converted the master bedrooms into dens. Preservation architect Gordon Olschlager moved into one of the units in 1992 and restored it using Ain's original drawings. Olschlager removed additions that were not part of Ain's original design. Olschlager also restored the sliding glass walls and sliding wood room dividers. Olschlager did not reverse all of the modifications, however, noting: \\"When you talk to people who know Gregory Ain, they say that he would have been comfortable with people personalizing their space.\\" Olschlager won a Merit Award in the Western Home Awards for his work on the Avenel Cooperative. By 2002, the units had become \\"magnets for architecture buffs\\" and were selling for \\"well over $300,000.\\" Historic designation Avenel Homes was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2005.

It works on child rights, disabilities rights, rights of people living with HIV/AIDS, prisoners' rights, refugee rights, rights of indigenous people, workers' rights, and rights of the minorities and people who have faced or are subject to sexual violence, among others. HRLN is a project of the Socio-Legal Information Centre (SLIC). SLIC is a non-profit legal aid and education organization, which provides free legal assistance to people who lack the capacity to approach courts for redress. SLIC files more than 100 petitions each year to protect the health, dignity, and rights of India's citizens. SLIC is one of the country's largest, most active legal human rights programs and reproductive rights unit. SLIC is also an implementing partner of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Details A non-profit non-governmental organization, HRLN started in 1989 as a small group of concerned lawyers and social activists from Bombay. The team was led by Colin Gonsalves, a public interest lawyer. Today, HRLN is considered the country‚Äôs leading public interest law group and has a nationwide network of more than 200 lawyers, paralegals, and social activists spread across 26 states/Union Territories. HRLN is also the parent body of the Indian People's Tribunal (IPT), also called the Indian People's Tribunal on Environmental and Human Rights or Independent People's Tribunal. Set up in June 1993, IPT is an unofficial panel led by retired judges who conduct public inquiries into human rights and environmental abuses. It provides an alternate outlet for the victims faced with official obstruction and delays in the delivery of justice. IPT conducts investigations into cases of relocation of rural people to make way for dams or parks, eviction of slum dwellers, industrial pollution and communal or state-sponsored violence. In 2003, HRLN was awarded the MacArthur Award for Creative and Effective Institutions for its contributions to reproductive rights advocacy in India. Activities = Legal aid and public interest litigation = HRLN offers pro-bono legal services to those with little or no access to the justice system, and runs a helpline for people seeking such help. It also conducts litigation in the public interest. Lawyers of HRLN take up cases in the lower courts as well as the Supreme Court and various state High Courts. = Legal education = HRLN provides training through several avenues and also trains young lawyers. HRLN also periodically publishes 'know your rights' material. The group also provides opportunities for internships and scholarships and organizes country- wide seminars, workshops, and training courses, such as paralegal certificate courses. = Advocacy = HRLN works to increase public awareness through research and dissemination of information on violations and anti-poor policies. HRLN has formulated laws and policies against child sexual abuse, against communal crimes, and for the right to food and work. = Investigations, monitoring, and crisis response = HRLN conducts fact-finding missions to monitor and document cases of violations. It also deploys crisis- intervention teams and makes sure that these cases take the form of petitions in court. = Publications = HRLN has published books on human rights, Dalit rights, refugee rights, violence against women, HIV/AIDS, trafficking, right to food, juvenile justice, domestic violence, and prisoner rights, among others. It also regularly produces films on human rights matters.

Earlier, on July 28, 2017 the top court had rejected a petition, on medical grounds, filed by another 10-year-old rape victim, who sought permission to terminate her 32-week-old pregnancy, which makes this recent judgment a big step in the right direction towards upholding the reproductive rights of women. The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1970, does not permit abortions beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy‚Äîa law that has been criticized for affecting women who discover abnormalities in the foetus or develop complications later in their pregnancies, and rape victims‚Äîparticularly underage ones. = Kedar Nath Yadav vs. State of West Bengal and Others, 2016 = In this high-profile case of state acquisition of agricultural land under emergency clause for industrial projects of private companies, HRLN in 2016 won the case on the behalf of farmers. In 2006, Tata company announced the setting up of a plant to manufacture its Nano 'small car' on 997 acres of land belonging to poor farmers in West Bengal's Singur district. It This acquisition was challenged by the farmers in the Supreme Court. HRLN lawyers appeared for some of the farmers and Supreme Court in 2016 quashed the acquisition. The Supreme Court also directed that the lands be returned to the farmers and that the compensation paid to them by the company be retained by the farmers. = Archbishop Raphael Cheenath S.V.D. vs. State of Orissa and Anr, 2008 = Huge human rights violations of innocent people took place in Kandhamal district following the assassination of VHP leader Swami Laxmanananda Saraswati where least 39 Christians were killed and 232 churches destroyed in the August 2008 violence. The Supreme Court in its judgement asked the Odisha government to re-investigate the closure of 315 cases out of the total 827 cases registered related to anti-Christian violence in Kandhamal district in 2008, and \\"see that the offenders are brought to book\\" which were earlier closed by the state police on the ground that either the offenders could not be traced or no offence was made out. The court also directed the state to pay additional compensation to the victims of the riots‚ÄîRs 3 lakh for the families of those killed in the violence. = Dhal Singh Dewangan vs. State of Chhattisgarh, 2014 = In a rare judgement, the Supreme Court acquitted a death row victim who was found guilty and sentenced to death by a trial court and the High Court saying the prosecution had not proved the charge against him of murdering his wife and five daughters on the basis of evidence on record. \\"In our view, the circumstances mentioned do not form a complete chain of evidence as not to leave any reasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the innocence of the appellant, nor do the circumstances exclude every possible hypothesis except the guilt of the accused,\\" the court said. = Shabnam Hashmi vs. Union of India and Others, 2005 = In this case argued by HLRN founder Colin Gonsalves, the Supreme Court extended the right to adopt a child to Muslims, Christians, Jews, Parsis and all other religious communities. This right had been till the judgment been restricted to Hindus, Buddhists and Jains. The court ruled that any person can adopt a child under the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act 2000 irrespective of religion he or she follows and even if the personal laws of the particular religion do not permit it. = Occupational health and safety association vs. Union of India and Others, 2005 = Colin Gonsalves represented the Occupational Health and Safety Organization in their writ petition asking the Supreme Court to issue directions to the government to make guidelines for safety of workers from occupational disease. The Petitioner represented about 130 CoalFired thermal power plants (CFTPPs) in India spread over different states, but functioning without proper occupational health services facility in place. The Supreme Court delivered a judgment that the right to health and medical care, while in service or post- retirement, is a fundamental right of a worker, and that right to health i.e. right to live in a clean, hygienic and safe environment is a right flowing from Article 21: the Protection Of Life And Personal Liberty. = Sandesh Bansal vs. Union of India, 2008 = Filed in 2008 by HRLN on the behalf of Sandesh Bansal, a health activist and member of the Jan Adhikaar Manch, the case sought accountability for the government's failure to respect, protect, and fulfill the rights of pregnant women. The Supreme Court recognized that a woman‚Äôs right to survive pregnancy and childbirth is a fundamental right protected under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. The court said, \\"It is the primary duty of the government to ensure that every woman survives pregnancy and child birth, for that, the State of Madhya Pradesh is under obligation to secure their life\\". In recognition of the fundamental nature of these rights, the Court ordered immediate implementation of the National Rural Health Mission, with a focus on strengthening infrastructure, providing access to timely maternal health services, skilled personnel, effective referral and grievance redressal mechanisms. = The National Association of the Deaf through its joint secretary and Another vs. Union of India and Another, 2011 = In this landmark judgement which benefited millions of deaf people in India, the Delhi High Court permitted deaf people to take driving tests, and obtain licences if they passed. Prior to this, the Motor Vehicles Act and Rules automatically disqualified deaf persons from obtaining licences on the presumption that deaf persons would be a danger to the public. HRLN filed a public interest petition in the Delhi High Court on the behalf of the National Association of the Deaf submitting that there was no evidence anywhere in the world to show that deaf persons would be a danger to the public, and that on the contrary, studies had shown that they were more careful drivers. = Devika Biswas vs. Union of India, 2012 = This petition was filed in response to the sterilization camp massacre in Bihar. Forced sterilizations were conducted on 53 women within a span of merely two hours. Subsequent fact- finding missions showed that the victims had not been given information about the operation, nor was their consent obtained. Their post-op conditions were not paid attention to, and they were left unattended to after the surgeries. In another instance from Chhattisgarh, 15 women died after surgeries in another sterilization \\"camp\\". In two camps, doctors used just two laparoscopes to operate on more than 30 women. Following her own investigation, the petitioner, health rights activist Devika Biswas, claimed before the Supreme Court of India (Court) that these incidents constituted a violation of the Constitution of India. The petition sought monetary compensation, directions for safety of patients, guidelines for terms of operations etc. The Supreme Court issued binding guidelines were issued for the conduct of sterilisation operations. = Jeeja Ghosh and Another vs. Union of India and Others = Following an HRLN petition, the Supreme Court ordered SpiceJet airlines to pay Rs 10 lakh as damages to a flyer suffering from cerebral palsy who was forcibly offloaded in 2012. The bench noted that differently-abled flyer Jeeja Ghosh was not given \\"appropriate, fair and caring treatment\\", which she required with \\"due sensitivity\\" and the decision to de-board her was \\"uncalled for\\" and violation of \\"human dignity\\". Ghosh, a disability rights activist, was offloaded from a SpiceJet flight in February 2012 from Kolkata when she was going to attend a conference in Goa hosted by NGO ADAPT (Able Disable All People Together). The top court held that the decision to offload Ghosh was taken by the airlines \\"in a callous manner\\", without any medical advice or consideration and her condition was not such that it required any assistive devices or aids. = Parivartan Kendra vs. Union of India and Others = Two sisters from the Dalit community from Bihar were brutally attacked with acid on October 21, 2012. One suffered burns on 28% of her body and 90% of her face, following the acid attack. Parivartan Kendra, a women‚Äôs group, filed a petition with the support of HRLN seeking to ensure that acid attack survivors are properly rehabilitated and are treated with immediate care, sensitivity and skill. The Supreme Court directed the Bihar government to compensate the first victim with Rs 10 Lakhs, and her sister with Rs 3 Lakhs.

He is the adoptive son of Mr. Ping and is one of Master Shifu's students. Po is also the prophesied Dragon Warrior, as well as the warrior of black and white. In Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, Po is revealed to have the ability to be able to learn kung fu at a glance. Po is also the team leader of the Furious Five, although he is not properly part of it as he is considered as a second master after Shifu to the Furious Five. The character has received largely positive critical reception, reaching influence to serve as the other characters, video games, and films in the media.DreamWorksAnimation.com ‚Äì \\"Zoo Atlanta and DreamWorks Animation Announce Panda Cub's New Name\\" Retrieved February 1, 2016 Personality Po is friendly, kind, energetic, impulsive, good-natured, spunky, innocent, fun- loving, compassionate, sarcastic, naive, loveable, and tenacious. Though Po's real passion was for Kung Fu, he was reluctant to disappoint his father by revealing it. Despite having a mild and friendly personality, Po also developed a severe self-loathing, believing himself a failure for being both obese (but in reality he is a healthy weight for his species) and a species not known for a warrior tradition. When he gets upset, he usually gorges on food to dull the pain. His main interest lies in Kung Fu. He developed an encyclopedic knowledge of the lore of warriors, famous combat moves, dates and historic artifacts. His deep appreciation of the martial arts extends into its philosophical aspects, enabling him to sometimes achieve insights of which even deeply respected masters like Shifu cannot conceive. He was popular with all his friends and they all loved him as a kid. He is an excellent cook, but has terrible table manners. His position within the Five is that of a little brother: he embarrasses everyone but is too lovable to hate. Appearances =Kung Fu Panda= Apparently, by accident, he was dubbed the Dragon Warrior by Master Oogway (who proclaims that \\"there are no accidents\\"), over Po's and his fellow masters' protests. During the subsequent training, Master Shifu and the Furious Five made no secret of their disdain for him, making their rough physical activities with him to torture to discourage him. However, with Master Oogway's encouragement, Po endured their abuse without complaint in the personal hope that they could eventually change him into someone he can respect. This display of indomitable tenacity, although frustrating to Shifu, soon impressed most of the Furious Five, who began to warm up to the affable panda whom they also found, to their delight at mealtime, is an excellent cook. Ironically, Shifu discovered that Po can perform considerable physical feats when motivated by food and used this to train him with a custom training regimen. At the end of the training, during a chopstick-sparring match over dumplings, Po demonstrated not only considerable skill in combat, which includes innovative moves using his bulk to his advantage but also some emotional maturity that allowed him to somewhat reduce his emotional dependence on food. This was evident when Po eagerly gives the last dumpling back to Shifu after winning the sparring match, stating that he's not hungry. Now convinced of Po's worthiness, Shifu presented the legendary Dragon Scroll to Po, only to find that it is a blank reflective surface. In despair, Shifu ordered Po and the Furious Five to help the villagers escape while Shifu bought some time for them to escape by engaging the snow leopard Tai Lung, who escaped from Chorh-Gom Prison, in a fight to the death. As Po helped his father escape, Mr. Ping revealed that the secret ingredient of his Secret Ingredient Soup is nothing; people only had to believe it was special. With this advice, Po realized the scroll's true empowering symbolic value: the power lay within the knowledge that whatever someone turned themselves into with enough dedication made them the best version of themselves they could be. Encouraged, Po was then able to challenge Tai Lung in a climactic battle and defeat him with an improvised combat style, using his body fat not only to shield his nerves from chi strikes but also for deflecting attacks. Amazed by his new talent, the Furious Five finally acknowledge him as a true kung fu master with respect, much to his surprise. Since the events of the first film, Po divided his time between practice, working at his father's noodle shop, and teaching children martial arts. The latter duty has shown Po to be exceptionally skilled in teaching its intellectual side. Secrets of the Furious Five Po has also improved his physical health when he runs alongside Shifu at an amazing pace and upon stopping, needs much less time than before to catch his breath. Shifu then assigns him to teach an introduction to kung fu to a group of rabbit children, to whom Po tries to explain the true meaning of kung fu, illustrating his point with the stories of the Furious Five's pasts. Kung Fu Panda Holiday Special Master Po is appointed as the host of the Kung Fu masters' Winter Feast at the Jade Palace. Although Po successfully makes the arrangements with considerable difficulty, he decides being with his father for the holiday is more important and joins him at the restaurant. However, all the masters, deeply moved by Po's loyalty, come as well. After this episode, Po moved out to focus on his duties as the Dragon Warrior with the reassurance that his father is at peace with his calling. =Kung Fu Panda 2= In Kung Fu Panda 2, Lord Shen's wolf forces performed a raid for refined metal for the peacock Lord Shen's cannons. Po's attempt to stop them with the Furious Five was thwarted by seeing the fealty symbol on the Boss Wolf of the raid. It brought Po's traumatic childhood memories of the attack on his village to the surface and froze him to the spot. He realized he was adopted by Mr. Ping, and asked to tell him about his past, but Mr. Ping can't tell Po anything from before the time he was found behind the noodle shop. When Master Po was sent with the Five on a mission to stop Lord Shen's attempt to conquer China, he was plagued with disturbing dreams about his parents replacing him with a radish. He was reluctant to talk about them, even to Tigress, who grew to be Po's confident in the Five. More seriously, Po was still hampered with his paralyzing flashbacks, especially at the sight of the same symbol on Lord Shen's plumage. This created a subsequent obsession in Po to question Shen, which results in him almost getting killed. Po survives Shen's cannon attacks and is rescued by the Soothsayer, who heals his body with acupuncture and medicinal brew. Po was able to recall all his memories of being orphaned and find inner peace. He did this in light of recalling the happy and fulfilling life with his loved ones in the Valley of Peace. By achieving tranquility, Master Po defeated Lord Shen's fleet‚Äîmuch to everyone's astonishment‚Äîby using a martial arts technique that countered Shen's cannon fire by literally grabbing the fired projectiles and returning them to destroy their launchers. In doing so, Po saved China while cementing his reputation as one of the mightiest warriors. Afterward, Po returned to Mr. Ping and tells him that he's his dad for having adopted him. However, Po is unaware that his biological father, Li is still alive, living in a panda hideout with the other villagers revealed to be the secret panda village and he finally senses that his son is alive. Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Masters Under the pretense of an emergency in the dead of night, Master Po (Jack Black) leads Master Tigress (Angelina Jolie) and Master Mantis (Seth Rogen) into breaking into the new Masters' Council exhibit in tribute of Masters Thundering Rhino, Ox, and Croc. Even though Tigress and Mantis are annoyed at the deception, Po engages their interest in the story of the trio of masters first met. =Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness= In Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness, Masters Po and Monkey are best friends in \\"Scorpion's Sting.\\" Monkey's being mind-controlled to kill Po by Scorpion, but the panda reminds him that they're friends and when that doesn't work, Po then hits him. In \\"Chain Reaction,\\" Po said that he would like to be Tigress' friend; he tells her that he \\"dreamed\\" of being friends with her since he was five and later when she goes off on him, he says that she \\"stinks at friendship and fun ship.\\" In \\"Bad Po,\\" it is revealed that Po has a split personality: one is kind, considerate, caring, polite, sensitive, very positive, helpful, hard-working, selfless and compassionate (which makes him \\"Good Po\\") and the other one is rude, very negative, lazy, sadistic, unhelpful, heartless, abusive, mean-spirited, selfish, manipulative, mischievous, cruel, uncaring, destructive, misbehaved, and devious (which makes him \\"Bad Po\\" or \\"Evil Po\\"). Both of his personalities have been split when he gets infected by the Mystical Mirror of Yin and Yang. Bad Po blames Good Po for his bad deeds and when one panda gets hurt, the other feels the same. In the end, Good Po makes Bad Po look in the mirror and both pandas are rejoined. =Kung Fu Panda: Secrets of the Scroll= As Po grew into his teenage years with a lack of focus and of his father's skill in cooking, which later led to Shifu getting food poisoning after Po prepared a meal for the Jade Palace while his father was away on business. Afterward, Po began to consider other possible career paths, such as a cleaner, comedian, dancer, or doctor, and made a list of them on a scroll. This scroll later inadvertently ended up in the hands of Tigress, who mistook it for a list made by Shifu of four warriors she was to gather to face the villainous Boar. This led to her recruiting Crane, Monkey, Viper, and Mantis, who were quickly dismissed by Shifu who also ordered the evacuation of the valley. During this time Po revealed to his father that he had caused Shifu's illness, which his father took as good publicity, and was then sent to gather ingredients for meals to be served to the fleeing villagers. From the hilltop his father had specified, Po then watched as the future Furious Five battled Boar, and quickly determined what he wanted to do with his life: practice Kung fu. He later made a set of Furious Five action figures which he treasured for years. =Kung Fu Panda 3= In Kung Fu Panda 3, Po is promoted to be a teacher when Shifu decides to retire from active duty to focus on honing chi. However, in his first lesson, Po's attempts to train the Furious Five ends disastrously, with the Five injured as a result. Po, demoralized and full of doubt, goes to Shifu for advice, who reveals that he'd deliberately set Po up to fail to help teach him a lesson, and advises him that he must be himself. When Po also tries talking about his problems with his father, Mr. Ping, they are interrupted by the arrival of Li Shan, Po's biological father, who breaks Po's dumpling- eating record at the restaurant. After recognizing each other, Po and Li Shan bond, much to Mr. Ping's jealousy. Shortly after bringing his father to the Jade Palace and introducing him to his friends, the Valley of Peace is attacked by living jade statues (referred to as \\"Jombies\\" by Po and Monkey) resembling kung fu masters both past and present. After the statues retreat, Po and the others learn that they were sent by Kai, a ferocious warrior who was once Master Oogway's ally. From Oogway's journal's they learn that Kai and Oogway learned the secrets of chi from the pandas from Li Shan's village some 500 years prior. Oogway then banished Kai to the Spirit Realm after Kai tried to take the pandas' powers of chi for himself. As Kai can only be defeated by a master of chi, Po decides to learn the power of chi on Li's suggestions as it was an innate ability of the inhabitants of the panda village. Po is told however that he must learn to live like a panda, which he takes to upon arriving in the village and is glad to be a part of. Later on, Tigress arrives at the Panda Village, revealing that Kai has taken the chi of all the kung fu masters including Shifu, Crane, Mantis, Viper, and Monkey, (she is the only one to escape) and that Kai has destroyed the Jade Palace. Terrified, Li begins evacuating the village while Po demands to be taught how to utilize chi. Li then admits he lied about knowing how to use chi to bring his son home and that all the pandas have forgotten how to use the ability. Hurt by his father's deception, Po isolates himself and trains rigorously to fight Kai, with his self-doubt returning. After talking with Tigress and discovering that Li and the other Pandas have decided to stay and help, Po, trains the village to use kung fu. When Kai attacks the village with his jade army, Po's unorthodox forces and tactics initially gain the upper hand. However, when Po uses the Wuxi Finger Hold on Kai, he is told by Kai that the technique only works on mortals. Kai then overpowers Po and prepares to take his chi. In a last-ditch effort to save his companions, Po grabs onto Kai and sends them both to the Spirit Realm where they battle again and Kai prepares to take Po's chi. After learning from Po about who they are, Li, Tigress, Mr. Ping and the other pandas use their chi to save Po, causing him to generate a dragon-shaped avatar composed of chi and to destroy Kai by overloading him with the flow of chi from within him. In the aftermath of the battle, Oogway appears to Po and reveals that Po's journey has come full circle; Oogway reveals that he specifically chose Po as the Dragon Warrior because he is a descendant of the ancient pandas who helped him centuries ago and that Po is the physical embodiment of the Yin and Yang, a perfect successor to the legacy that Oogway has built. Oogway also reveals that he was responsible for alerting Li Shan to Po's survival and is proud to see how Po has grown and matured. Oogway then presents him with a mystical jade staff to help him return to the mortal world and calls him a master of chi. Upon returning to the Mortal Realm, Po reunites with his family and friends and returns to the Jade Palace, gazing proudly at his legacy and the place where his journey first began. He then instructs the pandas, the kung fu masters, and the residents of the Valley of Peace in giving chi, which spreads good chi across the land.  Kung Fu Panda (DreamWorksTV)  In these short DreamWorksTV webisodes, Po offers everyday vlog-style insights into becoming a master of Kung Fu. = Kung Fu Panda: The Paws of Destiny = After fulfilling his true destiny as a Dragon Warrior of the prophecy thanks to his learning of his ancestral bloodline, Po is now a mentor of four panda kids (Nu Hai, Jing, Bao, and Fan Tong), who stumbled upon a mythical cave within Panda Village and being chosen by the spirits of Four Constellations, their legendary chi respectively.

He was a confidante of the kings Martin the Humane, Ferdinand of Antequera, and Alfonso the Magnanimous. He was the seventeenth President of the Generalitat de Catalunya from 1425 to 1428. Born in Barcelona and educated in literature and philosophy at the University of Lleida, Felip eventually earned a master's of theology from the University of Paris. He later took holy orders. Renowned for his oratory and his classical prose, among the ancients which he can be shown to have read are Pindar, Alcaeus, Horace, Catullus, and Serenus Sammonicus. A high percentage of his own manuscripts survive. Between 1419 and 1424 he penned his most important work, Memorial del peccador reemut, an ascetic treatise on Christianity, Judaism, and paganism. This manuscript now resides in the Biblioteca de Catalunya (MS. 465). Two incunabula of the Memorial del peccador reemut exist: the first was published in 1483 and the second in 1495 by Joan Rosenbach at the Abbey of Montserrat. In 1408 Felip was appointed conseller e promotor dels negocis de la cort (\\"counsellor and business promoter of the court\\") by Martin. He maintained this position under Ferdinand and Alfonso. Felip participated in the negotiations leading up to the Compromise of Caspe, putting his support decisively behind Ferdinand of Antequera and exerting effective influence on his part. Felip also played a role in the resolution of the Western Schism through his work at the Council of Constance and his efforts against the following of Benedict XIII, his former patron. In the election to choose a pope, Felip received six votes at Constance. In February 1413, the Consistori de Barcelona held a poetry competition at the Palau Reial Major. Both the opening speech (') and the closing one were given by Felip de Malla, one of the maintainers (mantenidors) of the Consistori. Both speeches were transcribed (and presumably delivered) in a Catalan liberally seasoned with classical and ecclesiastical Latin, as befitted Felip's education and reputation. Not surprisingly from a master of theology, it is intensely religious: {  :Per tal com D√©us √©s rei de tot la terra, monarca, pr√≠ncep, preceptor, provisor, administrador e triunfador universal, vostres metres, ¬°oh trobadors estudiosos!, vostres gais e ret√≤rics dictats, sien limats, brunits, cementats, soldats e ormejats ab dol√ß estil, mesura e comp√†s de sancta saviesa . . .Riquer, 574.  :For as God is king of all the earth, monarch, prince, preceptor, provider, administrator and universal conqueror, our poems, o studious troubadours, our gay and rhetorical words, are being filed, burnished, cemented, brazed and outfitted by the sweet style, measuring rod, and compass of the holy wisdom . . . } In light of the fact that Ferdinand was involved in a war with James II, Count of Urgell, Felip, whose duty it is as maintainer to give the contestants a theme, asked for short, sharp verses about war, namely, a sirventes.Riquer, 576. In 1423 Felip was the dean of the diocese of Huesca and then almoner of Elne. In 1424 he was elevated to the position of archdeacon of the see of Barcelona, which post he held until his death. In 1425 he was made president of the Generalitat. In that capacity he had to fight the distance between the king and the nobility, growing wider since the Corts de Barcelona of 1421. During his term Felip dealt with the introduction of Castilians into government offices, the lack of concern showed by King Alfonso for his Spanish territories, the preoccupation of the king with the conquest of Naples, and the attempt by Alfonso to create a fief for his younger brother Peter at Cervera. In 1428 Catalonia was ravaged by the plague, and an earthquake struck on 2 February. This earthquake was one of only several that struck Catalonia (especially Roussillon) during the years 1427-28\\\\. The duty of informing the king, who was then in Valencia, fell to Felip, whose letter and description of the event survives.Felip's letter is reproduced by Perarnau i Espelt. It is dated 9 February 1428. Felip left office later that year. He died on 12 July 1431 in Barcelona. Bibliography *Balasch i Recort, M. (1978). \\"El pensament biblic de Felip de Malla\\".

In sewing, piping is a type of trim or embellishment consisting of a strip of folded fabric so as to form a \\"pipe\\" inserted into a seam to define the edges or style lines of a garment or other textile object. Usually the fabric strip is cut on the bias. It may be made from either self-fabric (the same fabric as the object to be ornamented) or contrasting fabric, or of leather. Today, piping is common on upholstery and decorative pillows, but it is also used on clothing. Piped pocket openings, garment edges, and seams are characteristic of Western wear. Ecclesiastical use Piping is used extensively on the cassocks of clergy in western rite Christianity, particularly in the Roman Catholic and Anglican churches. Coloured piping is often used on black cassocks to indicate rank. In the Roman Catholic church, cassock piping is: black for priests; purple for chaplains of His Holiness; amaranth red for bishops, protonotaries apostolic, and Honorary Prelates; and scarlet red for cardinals. In the Anglican church piping is not used universally, many clerics preferring a plain cassock of solid colour. The most common cassock piping in the Anglican church is scarlet red piping for cathedral deans and canons, and for archdeacons; additionally bishops may wear black cassocks with amaranth red (usually called purple) piping.

Written in the form of a diary, The Bolshevik Myth describes how Berkman's initial enthusiasm for the revolution faded as he became disillusioned with the Bolsheviks and their suppression of all political dissent. Plot The narrative of The Bolshevik Myth starts in December 1919, when Berkman and Emma Goldman were deported to Soviet Russia along with over two hundred other anarchists, socialists, and other leftists. Berkman describes conditions on board the transport ship, the Buford. Berkman begins with great enthusiasm for the revolution. Unlike some of his fellow anarchists, he is willing to ignore the very different philosophy of the Bolsheviks. \\"From now on, we are all one‚Äîone in the sacred work of the Revolution\\", he tells a welcoming committee. \\"Socialists or anarchists‚Äîour theoretical differences are left behind. We are all revolutionists now.\\"Berkman, p. 30. The Bolshevik Myth describes the situation in Petrograd and Moscow. Food is scarce and rations are being cut. At the Moscow rooming house in which Berkman stays, meals are served at a common dining room. Berkman notes that the other residents watch an empty seat at the table. \\"In their eyes I read the frank hope that the missing one may not come: there will be a little more soup left for the others\\".Berkman, p. 47. In March 1920 Berkman and Goldman meet Lenin, whom Berkman describes as speaking with \\"a peculiar, almost Jewish, accent\\". Lenin tells them that freedom of the press is a luxury that cannot be permitted during the early stages of the revolution. Lenin assures them that anarchists will not be persecuted for their beliefs, but \\"we will not tolerate armed resistance or agitation of that character\\".Berkman, pp. 90‚Äì91. In May, Berkman learns that 45 anarchists have been imprisoned for many months, with no charges brought against them. The prisoners have begun a hunger strike to protest the conditions under which they are being held. Berkman tries to intercede with the Bolshevik leadership on the prisoners' behalf and ten of the anarchists are released, but the remainder are sentenced without trial to five years in prison. Berkman and Goldman are asked to collect material for a planned Museum of the Revolution, which gives them the opportunity to spend the remainder of 1920 traveling the countryside. In Ukraine they learn about Nestor Makhno and his insurrection. They visit a prison and labor camp in Kharkiv. In February 1921, strikes erupt in Petrograd when workers take to the streets demanding better food rations and more union autonomy. The unrest spreads to the port town of Kronstadt, where the Baltic Fleet is docked. The sailors of the fleet support the striking Petrograd workers; Lenin and Trotsky proclaim them guilty of mutiny and order a military response. Berkman and Goldman try unsuccessfully to intercede. In the fighting that ensues, thousands of sailors and workers are killed. It is becoming evident that the Bolsheviks are persecuting anarchists on ideological grounds. Golos Truda, an anarchist newspaper, is shut down. Growing numbers of anarchists are arrested. Bukharin denounces the anarchist movement in Russia as criminal bandits waging war against the Soviet Republic. The Bolshevik Myth ends in September 1921 with Berkman's decision to leave Russia. > Gray are the passing days. One by one the embers of hope have died out. > Terror and despotism have crushed the life born in October.... Dictatorship > is trampling the masses under foot. The Revolution is dead; its spirit cries > in the wilderness.... > I have decided to leave Russia.Berkman, p. 319.  The Anti-Climax  Initially, Berkman wrote a final chapter for the book, providing a theoretical analysis of bolshevik thought, practice and the outcome of the revolution, but it was later removed due to editor request, feeling that it did not fit with the tone of the rest of the book. In later years, newer editions of the book have included this last chapter.https://www.amazon.es/Bolshevik-Diary-1920-1922-Including-Anti- Climax/dp/1853050377 Aftermath Berkman and Goldman left Russia in December 1921. Almost immediately, Berkman began to write a series of pamphlets concerning the Russian Revolution. \\"The Russian Tragedy\\", \\"The Russian Revolution and the Communist Party\\", and \\"The Kronstadt Rebellion\\" were published during the summer of 1922.Walter, p. xii. The pamphlets have been collected and published as The Russian Tragedy. At the same time, Goldman began writing a book about her experiences in Russia, using material collected by Berkman as sources and with his editorial assistance. Berkman's plans for a book of his own were postponed.Walter, p. xiii. He wrote of his concerns to a friend: > What troubles me most is the writing and publication of my diary and book on > Russia.... I have consented, willingly and cheerfully, that EG [Emma > Goldman] make use of all the data, material, documents, etc., which I had > accumulated (and translated), for her book. Moreover, EG's forte is the > platform, not the pen, as she herself knows very well. Therefore my days and > weeks are now taken up, really entirely, as editor. It is not only that I > get no time for my own work, but my diary and my book (if I ever get to it) > must of necessity contain the very same things, data and documents, in > exactly the same wording even, as EG's book, for the translations are all > mine. As her book will be out first, what interest could my book (or even > the diary) have on the very same subject, covering the same period, speaking > of the same events, of the same places, even, since we visited them together > in our work for the Museum of Petrograd, and‚Äîworst of all‚Äîcontaining the > very same documents, etc., etc.Berkman to Michael Cohn, October 10, 1922; > Drinnon and Drinnon, p. 27. Work on Goldman's book, My Two Years in Russia, was completed in December 1922, and the book was published in two parts with titles not of her choosing: My Disillusionment in Russia (1923) and My Further Disillusionment in Russia (1924). Berkman worked on The Bolshevik Myth throughout 1923 and it was published in January 1925.Walter, p. xiv. According to Nicolas Walter, The Bolshevik Myth did suffer from being published after Goldman's book but it received positive reviews nonetheless. American anarchist Harry Kelly wrote a long review in which he described The Bolshevik Myth as \\"a great piece of literature\\". British philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote to Berkman that he had read The Bolshevik Myth \\"with the greatest interest\\", adding that \\"[m]y judgment of the Bolsheviks is substantially the same as yours; I went through the same disenchantment, having come with the same hopes\\". Analysis According to Berkman's preface, The Bolshevik Myth is \\"compiled from\\" the diary he kept during his two years in Russia,Berkman, p. xxvi. and most readers assume that it is Berkman's diary. Nicolas Walter researched Berkman's papers at the International Institute of Social History, however, and found that the diary format is a basically a literary device; Berkman essentially rewrote the material from his own diary to create The Bolshevik Myth.Walter, pp. xviii-xix.

From the book: > 'You don't know how you look on stage, but if what you're doing reads > clearly it means you have to try to be quite honest, because otherwise it > shows. You have to be very aware of how you work with yourself - it all > comes from what you feel at that moment. When I do James, for instance, I > actually say the lines to myself as I'm doing the mime. Not always, but... > you have to have the overall feeling at that moment, in that scene; and then > one scene leads into the next, and sometimes, if for instance in La Sylphide > or Napoli something doesn't go how I want during the first act, then when > I'm up in my dressing room in the intermission I try to work out what I > felt, and what do I need to do now, to get it in a way so it still works. > That way you don't always do it the same way - what I'm doing on Friday > might be a little different from last night because suddenly things fall out > a little differently in the first act.

Described as \\"Britain's only goth, lesbian, transsexual comedian\\", Black is known for performing black comedy, dealing with controversial subjects. History Born in Chorley, Lancashire, Black had a troubled childhood, suffering from depression. She attended Manchester Metropolitan University where she got a degree in film, television and cultural studies. Black had a nervous breakdown and attempted suicide on several occasions.Bethany Black: Life as a transsexual comedian, Guardian News and Media Limited, 2010-07-28, archived from the original on 2010-11-22 She has described her attempts in detail. She then came out to her family twice: first as a trans woman, and then as a lesbian. Black underwent sex reassignment surgery and discusses her transition in her stand-up act. Originally, she was hesitant about entering stand-up because she felt that the best comedians were older people. However, Black changed her mind after seeing Josie Long, someone younger than her, perform successfully while using material similar to her own. At the age of 25 she started her career, first as a compere for a music club in Preston called \\"Club Fuzzy\\", where she provided comedy between the music acts. After a hostile reaction, she then began performing in actual comedy clubs. Black adopted a \\"Fairy Gothmother\\" style, performing her routines dressed in black, with black eye shadow and sometimes wearing fetish clothing. Most of her comedy is a combination of observational comedy mixed with innuendo. Her career grew when in 2005 she opened the Manchester Pride festival. She also became a supporting act for other comedians such as Mick Miller and attracted positive reviews from other comedians such as Brendon Burns. In 2007, she became a finalist in the Chortle Student Comedy Awards. In 2008, Black started performing her show \\"Beth Becomes Her\\", which tells the story of Black's childhood. She had previously resisted performing material about her life story for fear of how her audience would react. However, the show went down well with most of the audience. It was nominated for the award for \\"Best Debut\\" at the Leicester Comedy Festival. Black was diagnosed in 2018 with autism, ADHD, OCD, and agoraphobia; these diagnoses were prominently referenced in her show Unwinnable at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe later that year. Reception Black reached the final of \\"2006 Funny Bones New Comedian of the Year\\" competition, the Chortle Student Comedy Awards in 2007, and was nominated for the \\"Best Debut\\" award at the Leicester Comedy Festival in 2008. Many critics believe that Black will be a successful comedian in the future, although her act has been criticized. The U.K. Comedy Guide Chortle.co.uk wrote in October 2006 that \\"Bethany's by no means the finished product, remaining entertaining rather than a must-see, but she seems to be in possession of all the comic tools it'll take to get her there ‚Äì most crucially a sharp tongue and an engaging personality you'd like to hear more from.\\" Yve Ngoo from BBC Tyne said in November 2006 that, \\"A seductively intriguing cross between Marilyn Manson and Corrie's Hayley Cropper (I'm alluding to ambiguous androgyny), Bethany's material is as black as her eye shadow and her delivery as dead-pan as a Goth at a garden centre.\\" In July 2007, Paul Jameson from BBC Tees wrote that, \\"New to the comedy circuit, Bethany strikes a sullen and almost apologetic presence on stage, and her comedy matches her appearance. She appears to not have quite decided whether to base her act on ridiculing suicidal Goths, or actually court the idea that she is one! This all resulted in a rather confusing set without much continuity. However, saying that, she did raise a number of laughs throughout her set and I'm sure with more experience and some polishing of her persona, she could be a lot better.\\" Paul Dale from The List attacked her \\"Beth Becomes Her\\" show in August 2008 saying, \\"It's hard to think of a show with a more personal pedigree at this year's Fringe. Unfortunately there is so little edge to the likeable but bland Black and her nervy nice-girl delivery allows her to murder the comedy gold dust and linger over the mundane. Disappointingly second rate.\\" However, David Pollock from The Scotsman was more positive saying, \\"This shock value is an integral part of Black's routine, but the obvious comfort this tall, emo-styled stand- up has in her new self is heartening. That her story starts with abortion, infidelity and suicide attempts and ends on a note of encouragement leaves a warm glow of optimism. But of course, Black's not here to make us feel good.\\" In 2011, Black came 96th in The Independent on Sunday's \\"Pink List\\" of influential LGBT Britons. In 2018, The Daily Star put Black on their list of celebrities flying the flag for the LGBT community and consider her a role model. Current projects Black is to perform a new show at the Fringe titled, \\"Love and a Colt 45\\", which covers other aspects of her life including her former alcoholism and drug addiction. She is also planning to adapt \\"Beth Becomes Her\\" for television with Paul Schlesinger. In 2011, Black co-founded Funny's Funny, a comedy organisation that set out to provide a free-entry comedy competition for female comedians. Black plays Helen Brears in Channel 4 series Cucumber, which premiered in January 2015. She is also the protagonist of an episode of the E4 sister series Banana. On 14 November 2015, Black guest starred as 474 in the ninth episode of the ninth season of Doctor Who, titled \\"Sleep No More\\". Black's character was a Grunt; a cloned warrior designed for physical strength rather than intelligence, and identifiable by tattoo-like markings on her face. Black's co-stars in the episode included Reece Shearsmith alongside regulars Peter Capaldi and Jenna Coleman. As a lifelong Doctor Who fan, Black was delighted by her casting and reportedly confused writer Mark Gatiss by asking if the episode would be linked to 1977's The Sun Makers, as both were set in the 38th century. On 21 November she appeared as a contestant on The Chase.

Strangely, Mansha had no significant achievements either at the national or international level before the Los Angeles Olympiad. There he finished seventh and last in the 100 metres event with a time of 10.87 seconds. The man who led Mansha's particular heat was Jamaica's Ray Stewart who did so in 10.24 seconds. Stewart ran in sixth in the final in 10.29 seconds. Mansha's time in the 200 metres race was 22.04 seconds. He ended sixth out of eight runners in his heat. Italy's Carlo Simionato with a time of 21.06 was first. Simionato didn't make the event's final. Mansha finally made a mark at the Pakistan domestic level at Islamabad in 1985, when he took the 200 metres gold in the National Athletics Championship. He repeated this feat at Quetta in 1986 when he also finished second in the 100 metres race. Mansha had an identical time of 21.7 seconds in his two 200 metres wins. At the South Asian Federation (SAF) Games in Dhaka, Bangladesh, in 1985, Mansha took silver medals in both the 100 metres (10.8sec) and 200 metres (21.58sec) events. Mohammed Shah Alam of Bangladesh won the gold medal in 100 metres (also with a time of 10.8) while India's Neelapu Rami Reddy was first in the 200 metres with a time of 21.1 seconds. Mansha's third medal at the 1985 SAF Games was a bronze in the 4x100 metres relay, the Pakistan quartet finishing in a time of 42.1 seconds. Mansha had taken part in the first SAG Games in Kathmandu in 1984 without winning any medals. He also toured China with a Pakistan squad and Alexandria (for the 31st CISM Military Games) later the same year, without achieving anything of note. At the Asian Games in Seoul in 1986, Mansha ran his 200 metres first round heat 2 in 22.21 seconds and was eliminated. He finished fourth in the 200 metres (21.93sec) at the SAF Games in Calcutta 1987 and after winning nothing at the SAF Games in Islamabad 1989 faded away from the athletics scene.

The first store was opened in Oregon, Ohio on Starr Ave. It was founded by Italian immigrant Pasquale \\"Pat\\" Giammarco in 1978. As of mid-2017, there are more than 800 franchised Marco's Pizza locations in 34 states and Puerto Rico, as well as the Bahamas, and India. Most recently, it was announced that Marco's Pizza has doubled its size and expects to open its 1000th store by the end of 2018. Marco's Pizza credits its franchisees as well as its dough, three-cheese blend, and pizza sauce for its strong growth. In 2016, Marco's Pizza was ranked at #10 on the Pizza Today list of the Top 100 Pizza Companies in the United States. The company was also named one of Marketing Quarterly‚Äôs Top 25 Pizza Chains and named by Franchising World as number eight on the magazine's list of ‚ÄúFast and Serious Growth Franchises‚Äù. The business operates locations in 33 states and Puerto Rico. Store locations offer online ordering and payment. History =Founding= Born in Sulmona, Italy, Pasquale \\"Pat\\" Giammarco is the founder of Marco's Pizza. Giammarco moved to the United States from the Abruzzo region of Italy when he was nine years old and grew up in Dearborn, Michigan, where he worked in his family's pizzeria. He and his father made the sauce recipe that is used in Marco's Pizza locations. =Modern history= In 2002, restaurant industry expert Jack Butorac was asked to analyze three restaurant concepts as potential growth opportunities, including Marco's Pizza. He traveled through Ohio and stopped at five Marco's Pizza stores in different cities along his route. He found different exteriors and inconsistent branding, but pizza that was the same at each location. \\"It was delicious,\\" Butorac told the New York Times in a 2014 interview. A veteran of large franchise operations, Butorac saw the possibilities in this regional brand. \\"What [Giammarco] didn‚Äôt have was how to brand it and differentiate it from other brands out there,\\" Butorac told Pizza Marketplace in an interview. Butorac began working as a consultant with Giammarco and soon began negotiations to purchase the franchising rights to Marco's Pizza. Butorac assumed leadership of the company in January 2004 with a vision to take Marco's Pizza national. In 2005 nationwide Marco's expansion began. Marco's experienced rapid expansion under Butorac's leadership. Since Butorac has owned the company, it has more than doubled in size and expanded to over 35 states, Puerto Rico, the Bahamas, and India. Butorac was presented with the prestigious Golden Chain award, a lifetime-achievement award in the restaurant business, by ''Nation‚Äôs Restaurant News\\" in July 2017. Marco's Pizza and its president, Bryon Stephens, were featured on the January 29, 2016, episode of the CBS television program Undercover Boss. The episode won its time slot in the TV ratings with 7.3 million viewers.  Menu  Marco‚Äôs Pizza menu is available for delivery or take-out, while some locations offer dine-in and catering options. The menu includes pizza, subs, wings, salads, CheezyBread, CinnaSquares, pizza bowls, and co-branded Ghirardelli brownies. Some of Marco‚Äôs specialty pizzas include White Cheezy, for which the pizza company won a gourmet competition in California. Among the unusual and specialty pizzas found at various times on the Marco‚Äôs Pizza menu are Chicken Florentine, Pepperoni Magnifico, Chicken Fresco, Spicy Fresco, and Double Pepperoni Spicy Fresco pizzas. The signature ingredient of the Fresco pizzas is Marco‚Äôs special Giardiniera, an authentic Italian pepper relish.  2017 accolades and ratings  Marco's Pizza is currently listed at #8 in Pizza Today's Top 100 Pizza Chains for 2017 and was named by Franchise Times as number eight on the magazine's list of Fast and Serious growth franchises.

Biography Manuel Bartlett Bautista was born in Tenosique to Gabriel Bartlett C√°mara, a businessman of partial Cornish descent, and Teodora Bautista P√©rez. He completed his primary studies in Tenosique and his secondary studies there and at the Mexican Methodist Institute of Puebla. From 1909 to 1915 he lived in Villahermosa, then known as San Juan Bautista de la Villa Hermosa, studying at the Instituto Ju√°rez while also agitating through revolutionary circles. In 1913 Bartlett helped found and became President of the Ju√°rez Institute's Free Student Association, but ended up being expelled from the school after leading a protest against Huerta's assassination of President Madero. While at the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico he worked as editor of the student newspaper El Estudiante, graduating with a degree in law in 1920. Bartlett returned to Villahermosa that same year and taught for a brief time at his old school, the Instituto Ju√°rez. He also served as syndic in the Ayuntamiento del Centro (City Council) and President of the Committee of Public Health. From 1921-22 he served as a deputy to the Congress of the State of Tabasco. From 1920 to 1929 he held various legal and governmental positions, including consulting lawyer to the City Council of Mexico City (1920); public defender to the military (1922); consulting lawyer to the Secretariat of Finance and Public Credit (1924‚Äì28); and chief of the legal department of the same (1929). After a decade working in different district-judicial capacities Bartlett was made a Justice of the Mexican Supreme Court, position which he would hold from 1941 to 1951. In 1953, after three previously unsuccessful attempts, Bartlett obtained the PRI's nomination for the governorship of Tabasco, a decision which, owing to the party's virtual monopoly on power, all but assured him the office. However, as a result of intra-party struggles combined with civil unrest in the state, Bartlett fell out of favor with the Adolfo Ruiz Cortines administration and was pressured to leave the post before the conclusion of his term. On March 22, 1955, Bartlett asked for and was granted a leave of absence by the State Congress, effectively ending his governorship. Bartlett was married to Isabel D√≠az Castilla, niece of famed poet and insurgent Salvador D√≠az Mir√≥n. His son Manuel Bartlett D√≠az is a high PRI official and former governor of Puebla. Manuel Bartlett Bautista died on April 24, 1963 and is buried in Mexico City.

This bronze alloy is very corrosion-resistant, a property which makes it suitable for use in environments such as the ocean. Bismuth bronzes and brasses are more malleable, thermally conductive, and polish better than regular brasses. The most common industrial application of these metals are as bearings, however the material has been in use since the late nineteenth century as kitchenware and mirrors. Bismuth bronze was also found in ceremonial Inca knives at Machu Picchu. Recently, pressure for the substitution of hazardous metals has increased and with it bismuth bronze is being marketed as a green alternative to leaded bronze bearings and bushings. History The earliest known artifact containing bismuth bronze is an Inca knife from Peru, found in 1912. Whether the alloy was chosen because of metallurgical properties which facilitated casting or because of its whiter, more lustrous finish is a matter of conjecture. It is unlikely that the inclusion of the bismuth was accidental, as was likely the case for most other early bronzes which contained bismuth, which makes this the earliest evidence of intentional addition of bismuth to an alloy. Bismuth bronze was rediscovered in the 1880s by James Webster for telegraph wires. Webster developed two bismuth-tin-bronze alloys. One alloy was developed as an early attempt at producing corrosion- resistant bronze, and was described as \\"hard, tough, and sonorous.\\" Webster also indicated that this particular alloy was also well suited to piano wires. Another early Webster alloy was described as \\"durable and bright\\" and later used in kitchenware due to its luster and slow tarnishing. This particular alloy's ability to hold polish made it useful as a light reflector or mirror material as well, which it continued to be used for into the twentieth century In the 1990s, autoparts manufacturer Federal Mogul began developing bismuth bronzes as an alternative to lead-containing bronzes because of increasing pressure on the removal of lead from both consumer and industrial applications. Bismuth is a non-toxic heavy metal, and as legislation such as the EU Restriction of Hazardous Substances or the American Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act continue to regulate the amount of lead that can be in a product or environment, more lead-free alternative materials have been developed which maintain properties of their lead predecessors without containing lead. Bismuth is an especially appropriate replacement for lead leaded bronze bearings because, like lead, bismuth is insoluble in copper and forms similar micro-globules that mimic lead. Characteristics =Structure= Modern \\"bismuth bronze\\" is technically neither an alloy nor a bronze, but a composite material containing brass and bismuth (though some bronzes are still used). Because bismuth, like lead, is insoluble in copper, it exists as discrete micro-globules of bismuth within the grain boundaries of the alloy which behave as bismuth particles. These particles deform easily within the crystal structure and across the surface of the metal to act as a low-shear solid lubricant in cases of low lubrication. Selenium is added to red copper-bismuth alloys because it strengthens properties of the bismuth of the material. Because liquid bismuth can lead to embrittlement in an alloy, care must be taken in processing and recycling of these materials. =Properties= Modern bismuth bronzes on the market are developed to hold similar properties to leaded bronzes, and many of them bear nearly identical mechanical properties to common leaded alloys, such as machinability and high thermal conductivity. They also have a high lubricity, which makes them ideal for outer layers in machine parts which are subject to wear such as bearings and swashplates. Bismuth-tin bronze is not easily corrosive to water; preliminary bismuth is not easily oxidized. =Applications= Originally, bismuth-tin bronze was developed for telegraph wires. However, in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, the bronze became more commonly used in mirrors, reflectors, kitchenware, and piano wires. It fell out of common use in the first half of the twentieth century. Modern bismuth bronze alloys are marketed as a green alternative to lead, often chosen over the less expensive leaded bronzes because of environmental regulation. They are found as a surface layer on automotive or mechanical components which receive heavy wear such as hydraulic piston pumps. These alloys are also commonly used in bearings or bushes in tribologic systems. Also, some bismuth-bronze plumbing fittings are manufactured. Processing =Casting= Cope & drag (top and bottom halves of a sand mold), with cores in place on the drag Lead-free bismuth bronze castings are produced by frozen molds. Sand characteristics are used to increase the rate of cooling of the bronze castings because the sand particles have a higher thermal conductivity, greater grain size and spherical shape. The mold has a high cooling potential. When the mold is frozen, the ice near the surface contracts to molten metal and thaws immediately. =Extruding and annealing= Another way bismuth brass can be processed includes the extrusion brass rod through machining to form the material into a desired shape. The material is then annealed to relieve stress that was caused by the machining. The material is annealed at a certain annealing temperature and time depending on the material‚Äôs composition. The time is selected to limit diffusional movement of bismuth. This reduces cracking of the fixture. Image:Aluminium extrusion die front.pngFront side of a four family die. For reference, the die is in diameter. Image:Aluminium extrusion die closeup.pngClose up of the shape cut into the die. Notice that the walls are drafted and that the back wall thickness varies. Image:Aluminium extrusion die back.pngBack side of die. The wall thickness of the extrusion is . =Water atomization= High-pressure water atomization is a processing method of bismuth brass. This is a way of rapidly solidifying the metal alloy. A liquid metal is dispersed into droplets by the impingement of high-pressure jets of water. It is a low-cost process to achieve a distribution of fine particles in iron, stainless steel, and low-alloy metal powders. This is a way of rapidly solidifying the metal alloy. A limitation of water atomization is the powder purity. For metals that are inclined to oxidation, this is a major problem.

The character appeared in the series Runaways.Runaways: Volume 2, #28 When the time-displaced Runaways landed in 1907, they meet twelve-year-old Klara, a girl of German descentRunaways: Volume 2, #30 who had to live to serve her abusive middle-aged husband. Klara's ability is to control or \\"talk to\\" (as she puts it) plants. Her name is a play on the word chloroplast, relating to her plant powers. When her family discovered her powers, they married her off to someone moving to America (even though she was still a child), where she ran into the Runaways in 1907, who later brought her back to the present with them. Klara is roughly Molly's age, has jet-black hair twisted in a braid, and gray eyes. Publication history Klara Prast first appeared in Runaways Vol. 2 #27 and was created by writer Joss Whedon and artist Michael Ryan. This was the character that Whedon had mentioned he would add when he began his tenure of the book.Joss Whedon talks Runaways Fictional character biography =1907= Readers are first introduced to Klara after the Runaways helped to stop a fire in a factory full of children in New York City in the year 1907,Runaways vol.2 #27 where they had become displaced due to a time device created by Gert's parents. Had history proceeded as normal, Klara would have died that day, on June 27, 1907.Runaways vol.2 #26 After the fire is put out, Karolina flies through the factory looking for survivors and comes across a bridge of rose vines through a hole in the wall and catches a glimpse of Klara as she runs away. Later that night, Karolina comes across some similar roses and spies into a window, where she sees young Klara about to be beaten by an older man for not selling the flowers for money, angering Karolina greatly. The next day, Karolina takes Molly with her to confront Klara about her powers, and tell her not to worry. When Molly asks if she'd like to join the team to get away from her abusive life, they are stunned to learn that it's not so easy for her, as the man Karolina saw was not her father, but her husband.Runaways: Volume 2, #29 She makes it clear to Karolina, though Molly does not appear to understand, that he both physically and sexually abuses her. Later, however, Molly refers to Klara's \\"duty\\" to her husband as \\"not just a sin, it's illegal\\", suggesting she understands more than she lets on. As it turns out, Klara's family had married her off to Mr. Prast (who was traveling to America) and turned their backs on her because her mother had seen her as something unholy and called her powers a \\"curse\\". Karolina and Molly manage to persuade Klara to come with them, albeit hesitantly. Klara gets scared and runs off after seeing Karolina and Xavin, in her female form, have an intimate moment, which she finds to be wrong due to her conservative upbringing. Molly confronts her on this and leaves her saddened, saying she's acting just like another grownup. Later, just after the Runaways' great alley battle, they find Klara battered and bruised by her husband. The team gladly accepts for her to come with them, returning to the same point they left. =Secret Invasion= At the start of the Runaways/Young Avengers tie in to Secret Invasion, the team is still fresh from arriving back in the present and giving Klara one final tour of the present version of New York City before heading back to California. Klara is the first one of the group to spot the Skrull ships descending upon the city, and after the invasion starts, she is knocked out, along with the rest of the team, by their own Skrull member, Xavin, as he is trying to protect them from these Skrulls whom he recognizes to be religious extremists.Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers #1 Klara later plays a vital role in the battle between the two teams and the Skrull known as Chrell, Xavin's former mentor and a powerful member of the invading army. As the other Runaways, minus Xavin, are held in his clutches, Klara manages to cause a large tree to spring under Chrell's feet, wrapping him up and allowing the others to be freed, which turns the tide of the battle against him.Secret Invasion: Runaways/Young Avengers #3 =Los Angeles= When the Runaways finally return to Los Angeles, Klara is constantly in awe of the various inventions and advancements the world has made, everything from television to food; she does not realize that such superhuman menaces as alien invasions and other crises the Runaways face are not also typical and accepted parts of her new era. When the team makes a trip to the local mall so Chase can look for a job, a manager from a local radio station falls over a high railing, and Klara immediately leaps into action, ordering the indoor plants to grow up and catch him, then lie back down once he's safe. The team then beats a retreat from the mall, hoping no one noticed them.Runaways: Volume 3, #1 While the Runaways slowly separate because of Nico's spell, Molly and Klara go to build a fort. After a long talk with Molly, a smiling Klara quips: \\"Ships that sail in the sky. Parks filled with dinosaurs. I'm never going to get used to this century.\\"Runaways: Volume 3, #3 =Homeschooling= In Runaways Vol. 3 #11, the first issue written by Kathryn Immonen and drawn by Sara Pichelli, Chase, Nico, Victor and Karolina hold a house prom. An outside source manages to send a UAV flying into the Runaways' Malibu home, in the upstairs living room where Klara and Old Lace lie. Nico, Victor and Karolina rush to save Klara and Old Lace - upon arriving at the top, however, it's revealed that Old Lace had shielded Klara, who ends up alive. Old Lace, however, slowly dies. Chase, in the downstairs living room, feels her die, as part of her connection to him, he huddles over apologizing to Gertrude Yorkes.Runaways #11 Klara, who recovers from the attack, ends up bloodied. She screams for Old Lace's body to be taken away from her, and within minutes, the entire house is covered in long, twisted vines - Nico herself ends up almost strangled. =Best Friends Forever= In Runaways Vol. 5 #11, the Runaways attempt to rescue Klara from her new family, but Klara declined their invitation stating that she doesn't want to live as a runaway. She acknowledges that she had work to get over her preconceptions and prejudices about homosexuality but she's happy with her two foster dads. She did not believe that all adults are evil like she used too. The gang understood and respected Klara's decision and left with a broken-hearted Molly. Runaways: Volume 5, #11 Powers and abilities Klara has the ability to control and manipulate the growth and movement of plants at will and with incredible ease, demonstrated frequently, known as Chlorokinesis. She likes to describe this ability as \\"talking to\\" the plants, something she says she did back on her family's farm in Bern. An example of her actually speaking to the plants comes when Klara manages to save a radio station manager from falling by calling out \\"grow!\\" prompting the mall plant life to burst out of their planters and save him, then \\"thank you, yes, lie down\\" when finished. She appears to be able to manipulate any kind of plant material, but has an affinity for roses since they \\"speak back\\" to her. Klara had once caused large, violent vines to burst out of the ground and shield her. Furthermore, the plants she manipulates also seem to react to Klara's emotions; such as when Molly leaves Klara saddened after confronting her on her attitude toward her friends, the roses on the vines begin to wilt. Completely unfamiliar with the modern world, Klara is timid and has no combat skills to speak of. When she is panicked or upset, her control over her abilities suffers greatly, and this can result in her plants attacking anyone that approaches her, including her own friends. Klara has mentioned that she is unable to swim.Runaways vol. 3 #6 She is also fluent in English and German. In 2010, The Official Handbook To The Marvel Universe confirmed that she was indeed a genetic mutant. Personality Besides Karolina, Molly is the one member Klara connects well with, because of their ages, even though it can seem that Klara is \\"much older and wiser than Molly because of the way she's grown up and the life she's experienced already.\\" However, living in the 21st century has made her experience the fun and joys in life. Relationships with other Runaways =Molly Hayes= When they travel to the past, Karolina introduced Molly to Klara because they are closer in age.Runaways: Volume 2, #27 Molly invites her to join the team, and together they manage to convince her to come with them to escape her tragic fate of being married to an abusive husband (the details of which Molly does not seem to fully understand due to her sheltered life). When Klara is upset by Karolina's seemingly interracial lesbian relationship, it causes a rift between her and Molly, as Molly defends Karolina and cannot relate to Klara's homophobic and racist attitudes, a result of her upbringing. Klara is visibly saddened by the confrontation (her emotions reflected in her roses) and leaves. While Molly has come to be close with Xavin, Klara has not (Xavin was the one she saw Karolina kissing) and this is one thing the two twelve-year- olds have yet to resolve in the process of solidifying their friendship. They also have very different personalities, with Molly feeling young compared to Klara, who has weathered a lot of difficulties in her life.

He was a member of the princely Ghica family, which ruled Moldavia and Wallachia at various times from the 17th to the 19th century. He died in prison in May 1954 after his arrest by the Communist regime. Biography =Early life= Vladimir Ghika was born on Christmas Day of 1873 in Constantinople (now Istanbul, Turkey). His father was John Ghika, diplomat, minister plenipotentiary in Turkey ; his mother Alexandrina was born Moret de Blaremberg (van Blarembergue) in a Flemish- Russian family ; he had four brothers and a sister: Gregory, Alexander, George and Ella (who both died at an early age), and Demetrius Ghika (future ambassador and minister of foreign affairs). He was the grandson of the last Prince sovereign of Moldavia, Prince Gregory V Ghika, who ruled from 1849‚Äì1856. He was raised with the Orthodox faith. In 1878, in order to give a good education to the children, the family moved to Toulouse in France. There, they frequented the Protestant community, because the Orthodox church was not represented in the area. Ghika received his Degree in Law in 1895, after which he attended the Paris Faculty of Political Science. At the same time, he frequented courses of Medicine, Botany, Art, Literature, Philosophy, and History. Ghika returned to Romania due to an attack of angina pectoris and continued his studies in Romania. Ghika was an alumnus of the College of St. Thomas, the future Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas Angelicum, in Rome. In 1898, he enrolled in the Faculty of Philosophy and Theology. At the Angelicum, Ghika completed a licentiate in Philosophy and a Doctorate in Theology in 1905.Holy Father declares Angelicum alumnus \\"venerable\\". 4 June 2013 Soon after, he converted to the Catholic faith in 1902. =Pilgrimage= Prince Ghika at Paray-le-Monial, holding up the Sacred Heart banner of Roman Catholicism in Romania (1917) Ghika wanted to become a priest or monk, but Pius X advised him to give up the idea, at least for a while, and to dedicate himself to secular apostolate instead. He became one of the pioneers of the lay apostolate. After returning to Romania, he dedicated himself to works of charity and opened the first free clinic in Bucharest called Mariae Bethlehem. He also set the foundation for a great hospital and sanatorium named after Saint Vincent de Paul, founded the first free hospital in Romania and the first ambulance, thereby becoming founder of the first Catholic charity work in Romania. He was dedicated to patient care while participating in health services in the Balkan War in 1913, without the fear of cholera in Zimnicea. He was also in charge of diplomatic missions among the Avezzano earthquake victims of tuberculosis of Hospice of Rome during World War I. On 7 October 1923, Ghika was ordained a priest in Paris by Cardinal Dubois, Archbishop of the city. He served as a priest in France until 1939. Shortly after Ghika was ordained, the Holy See authorized him to celebrate the Byzantine Rite. Prince Ghika thereby became the first bi-ritual Romanian priest. On 13 May 1931, the Pope appointed Ghika to be an Apostolic Protonotary, but he was reluctant to accept it. He worked worldwide, including Bucharest, Rome, Paris, Congo, Tokyo, Sydney, and Buenos Aires, among others. Later, in jest, Pope Pius XI called him an \\"apostolic vagabond\\".Andrei Gotia (January 2015) \\"Blessed Vladimir Ghika: prince, priest, and martyr\\". Logos: A Journal of Catholic Thought and Culture. =Imprisonment and death= On 3 August 1939, he returned to Romania, where he was caught in the Second World War. He refused to leave Romania at that time so that he could be with the poor and sick. However, he left eventually for the same reason in Bucharest when they started Allied bombing. After the Communists came to power, he also refused to leave on the royal train, for the same reasons. He was arrested on 18 November 1952, because of his support for the Catholic Church in communion with Rome and his opposition to the schismatic church that the regime was creating.

Hometown Jamboree was sponsored by the Hub Furniture store once it moved to Anaheim. The show was the springboard for many of country music's premier musicians including Tennessee Ernie Ford, Billy Strange, Zane Ashton (aka Bill Aken), Speedy West, and a host of others. The show ended each week with the cast singing a hymn, a tradition Tennessee Ernie Ford brought to his own program The Ford Show Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford. By that time, Cliffie Stone was Ford's personal manager. Hometown Jamboree premiered as a weekly TV broadcast in December 1949 over KLAC-TV (later known as KCOP) in Los Angeles; in 1953 it moved to KTLA-TV, where it ran until its cancellation in 1959.

Andrew-Street was a captain and life member of Collingwood Cricket Club. Born in Bondi, Sydney, he played a total of six VFL games at Collingwood, five in 1933 and the other in 1934. His only first-class cricket game came in 1937/38 against Tasmania at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where he opened the batting in both innings, making 21 and 16. His sporting career was cut short by service in the RAAF in World War II where he served as a pilot and flight instructor, largely in New Guinea. At age three, 'Andy' had lost his own father to World War I's Western Front at Ypres. Alfred Gordon Andrew took on his step-father's surname and went on to be educated at Trinity Grammar, Melbourne.

Biodiesel sample The European standard for biodiesel is EN 14214, which is translated into the respective national standards for each country that forms the CEN (European Committee for Standardization) area e.g., for the United Kingdom, BS EN 14214 and for Germany DIN EN 14214. It may be used outside the CEN area as well. The main difference that exists between EN 14214 standards of different countries is the national annex detailing climate related requirements of biodiesel in different CEN member countries. Other international standards published by ASTM International include: * D6751-08 Specification for Biodiesel Fuel Blend Stock (B100) for Middle Distillate Fuels * D975-08a Specification for Diesel Fuel Oils (on and off-road applications) * D396-08b Specification for Fuel Oils (home heating and boiler applications) * D7467-08 Specification for Diesel Fuel Oil, Biodiesel Blend (B6 to B20) There are also DIN standards for three different varieties of biodiesel, which are made of different oils: *RME (rapeseed methyl ester, according to DIN E 51606) *PME (vegetable methyl ester, purely vegetable products, according to DIN E 51606) *FME (fat methyl ester, vegetable and animal products, according to DIN V 51606) The National Standards of Canada for biodiesel are published by the Canadian General Standards Board (CGSB):http://www.tpsgc-pwgsc.gc.ca/ongc- cgsb/publications/catalogue/index-eng.html. *CAN/CGSB-3.520 Diesel Fuel Containing Low Levels of Biodiesel (B1 - B5) *CAN/CGSB-3.522 Diesel Fuel Containing Biodiesel (B6-B20) *CAN/CGSB-3.524 Biodiesel (B100) for Blending in Middle Distillate Fuels The standards ensure that the following important factors in the fuel production process are satisfied: *Acid value *Complete reaction. *Removal of glycerin. *Removal of catalyst. *Removal of alcohol. *Absence of free fatty acids. *Low sulfur content. *Cold Filter Plugging point *Cloud Point Basic industrial tests to determine whether the products conform to the standards typically include gas chromatography, a test that verifies only the more important of the variables above. Tests that are more complete are more expensive. Fuel meeting the quality standards is very non-toxic, with a toxicity rating () of greater than 50 mL/kg. ASTM B20  ASTM International has approved a new specification for diesel fuel blends containing 6%-20% biodiesel. According to the National Biodiesel Board (NBB), ASTM standards for the 20% biodiesel blends, or B20, are a crucial hurdle for the full acceptance of the use of such blends in diesel vehicles. In 2008, ASTM published new Biodiesel Blend Specifications.National Biodiesel Board Press Release 10/14/08 With the new specification in place, automakers and engine manufacturers can test B20 in their diesel engines and know that consumers will be fueling their vehicle with a fuel of the same quality. Currently, Chrysler LLC supports the use of B20 in its Dodge Ram diesel pickups, but only for use in fleets. Likewise, General Motors Corporation accepts the use of 5% biodiesel blends, or B5, in all its vehicles, but limits the use of B20 to special equipment options available only to government fleets in a limited selection of vehicles. While setting the new B20 standard, ASTM International also made changes to its specifications for B5 and for 100% biodiesel, or B100.EERE News: EERE Network News The FTC will require pumps with biodiesel blends to carry a blue label, while biomass-based diesel blends will carry an orange label. The somewhat confusing \\"small print\\" was required by the energy act. Credit: Federal Trade Commission Engine warranty concerns also came into play in a recent effort to create labeling requirements for diesel fuels containing renewable fuel blends. The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to set labeling requirements that address the blending of biodiesel and other types of biomass-based diesel fuels into diesel fuel. Some companies are converting biomass such as animal fats directly into a liquid with the properties of diesel fuel, a product that blurs the lines between biodiesel and diesel fuel. At first, the FTC proposed to treat all renewable diesel fuels the same, but the NBB warned that not all biomass-based diesel fuels would necessarily meet the ASTM standards required by automakers for diesel fuels. On the other hand, biomass-based diesel fuels that meet ASTM standards could be used in much higher concentrations than biodiesel, which is usually limited to 20% biodiesel blends for standard diesel vehicles. Considering those comments, the FTC decided to set separate labeling requirements for biodiesel blends and biomass-based diesel fuel blends.

It is located on the shores of the Godavari River in the town of Bhadrachalam, a part of the Bhadradri Kothagudem district in Telangana state. Often simply referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadradri, the temple is considered one of the Divya Kshetrams of Godavari and is also revered as Dakshina Ayodhya. According to the legend, Vishnu appeared to Meru son Bhadra as Rama to answer the latter's prayers. However, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal human and appeared as Vaikuntha Rama with four hands. Sita and Lakshmana form part of the temple's moolavar. The self-manifested moolavar was discovered in the 17thcentury by Pokala Dhammakka, a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem. After she built a mandapam for the idols, Bhadrachalam's tehsildar Kancherla Gopanna constructed this temple during the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah. After Gopanna, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu and Varada Ramadasu looked after the temple's rituals. Bhadrachalam follows the Vaishnavite Pancharatra Agama tradition, and its system of worship is modelled on that of the Ranganathaswamy temple in Srirangam. The temple has four entrances; the Rajagopuram is located at the northern entrance, which is called the Vaikuntha Dwaram. The temple houses a number of sub-shrines and a few mandapams. Bhadrachalam is notable for its principal deity Rama. According to the Brahma Purana, the temple's deity is capable of imparting knowledge to those who worship him. Gopanna used Bhadrachalam as a centre of the Bhajan tradition to spread awareness of the Vaishnavite tradition. The annual Brahmotsavam is the biggest festival celebrated in Bhadrachalam; the key event is the Sri Sitarama Thirukalyana Mahotsavam, or the marriage of Rama and Sita on the eve of Sri Rama Navami. Other important festivals celebrated in Bhadrachalam are Vaikuntha Ekadashi, Vasanthotsavam, and Vijayadashami.  Legend  According to Hindu legend, in the Treta Yuga, Rama (avatar of the god Vishnu), along with his consort Sita and brother Lakshmana, stayed in the Dandaka forest as a part of their fourteen-year exile. Due to Rama's grace, a stone turned into a human called Bhadra, who was considered the son of Mount Meru. Devoted to Rama, Bhadra later met the sage Narada, who initiated an upadesam (instruction) of the Rama Taraka mantra. Bhadra mediated and chanted the mantra on the banks of the Godavari River for several years. Pleased, Rama promised to return to meet Bhadra when he had found Sita, who had been abducted by the demon king Ravana. However, Rama failed to fulfill his promise in his lifetime. Later, Vishnu was pleased with Bhadra's devotion and appeared before Bhadra in the form of Rama. In a hurry, Vishnu forgot that Rama was a mortal with two arms and appeared with his four celestial arms. Rama in upper arms held a shankha (conch) and the Sudarshana Chakra (discus) and a bow and an arrow in his lower hands. Sita was seated on his left thigh and Lakshmana stood to his left. All three faced west towards the Godavari River. Rama held the conch in his right upper hand in contrast to Vishnu, with the intention of giving salvation to Bhadra. Rama turned Bhadra into a hillock; the images of the deities in the same postures manifested at its summit. The hillock was referred to as Bhadrachalam or Bhadradri (\\"Bhadra's hill\\"). The central icon of Rama is referred by various epithets. Since Rama descended from Vaikuntha (Vishnu's abode) and manifested there, he was called \\"Vaikuntha Rama\\". As the deity is four-armed like Vishnu (Narayana), he was named \\"Rama Narayana\\". The trio of deities together signified the aspects of the sacred sound Om, which earned Rama the sobriquet of \\"Om-kara Rama\\".  History  A statue of alt=A black statue of an aged man holding a tambura in his hand In the 17th century CE, Pokala Dhammakka, a tribal woman living in Bhadrareddypalem, found the central icon of Rama in an anthill. She dissolved the anthill using the water from the Godavari River. With the help of the villagers, Dhammakka constructed a mandapam (hall) and offered prayers to the deities. During the reign of Abul Hasan Qutb Shah (1672-1686), Kancherla Gopanna served as the tehsildar (revenue officer) of Bhadrachalam. Gopanna was given the title of Ramadas (Rama's servant) by Kabirdas, a Muslim saint who was impressed with his charity. Following the Shah's orders, Gopanna enforced the Jaziya tax, a penalty designed to force Hindus to adopt Islam. Observing the dilapidated state of the temple, Gopanna decided to build a temple for the deity by raising donations. In the initial attempt, Gopanna received harsh criticism from the local Hindus for enforcing the tax. Dejected by numerous rebuffs, Gopanna decided to use a portion of the tax collected to build the temple and face the consequences. The temple was completed at a cost of nearly six lakh varahas. After learning the truth, the Shah was enraged, and Gopanna was summoned to the court. Gopanna explained that he never intended to misuse the treasury funds and planned to reimburse using donations he expected to receive in the future. The Shah ordered his soldiers to hang Gopanna if the sum was not repaid within twelve years, and imprisoned him. On the last day of the twelfth year, Rama and Lakshmana appeared in Shah's dream and repaid the entire sum in Rama madas (gold coins with Rama's inscriptions on them). When the Shah woke up, he saw real gold coins and released Gopanna. He gave Gopanna a pension for life and donated the area around Bhadrachalam as an endowment to the temple. Some scholars dismissed the idea of Rama paying the money, saying that the Shah had held a fair and impartial inquiry, found Gopanna innocent, and exonerated him with due Honor. Years later, Tumu Lakshmi Narasimha Dasu of Guntur and his friend Varada Ramadasu of Kanchipuram offered prayers daily at Bhadrachalam and spent their life there. After Varada Ramadasu's death, Narasimha Dasu carried his corpse into the Godavari and died by drowning. The temple was a part of the Godavari district until the end of the Visalandhra movement, after which the town was merged into Khammam district in 1956. The temple's maintenance and administration were undertaken by the endowment ministry of the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1958. Repairs were made to the temple in 1960 under the supervision of the then-endowments minister Kalluri Chandramouli. In August 1986 the temple faced a severe threat from flash floods in the Godavari River. The main streets and several structures, including cottages, were submerged in water for nearly five days. Many local people took shelter in the halls of the temple. The kalyana mandapam (marriage hall) was completely inundated except for its gopuram (temple tower). P.Seshacharyulu and other priests stayed in the temple and performed all the daily rituals without any interruption during the floods. The Nizam of Hyderabad, Mir Osman Ali Khan during his time made a huge donation of Rs. 50,000 for this temple during his time. During the Telangana movement, both the states of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh claimed that the Bhadrachalam temple belongs to their respective regions. Telangana politicians and activists stood firm on their stance and stated that they would not let Bhadrachalam be separated from the state. Bhadrachalam was retained in Telangana, and after reorganisation of districts in October 2016, the temple became a part of Bhadradri Kothagudem district. Lord Sri Rama temple constructed about 400 years ago on the Bhadrachalam hill. The name Bhadrachalam is derived from ‚ÄòBhadragiri‚Äô in other words the mountain called Bhadra, who is said to be the child d of Meru and Menaka. It is a town in Kammam district of newly formed state of Telangana. It is situated at 17.67¬∞N 80.88¬∞E at an average elevation of 50 metres (164 feet). It was a dense forest during Threthayuga when Lord Sri Rama visited this place and roamed around the river Godavari with his consort Seetha and Lakshmana during their vanavasam. They had built a hermit in this area at a distance of about 35 kms from here at the place called ‚ÄòChithrakuta‚Äô, in Parnasala as suggested by sage Agasthya. That was the spot from where Ravana, the demon king of Sri Lanka, kidnapped Seetha. There is another story of Sabari, the grand old saintly woman who was waiting for Sri Rama‚Äôs arrival and gave him fruits to eat after tasting the fruits herself before offering to Rama. The sthala purana says that this was the place where that episode took place. Thereafter Sabari took the form of river. Evidently the Sabari River flows here and joins River Godavari. However there is Sabari hill in Kerala, where Lord Ayyappaswami temple is situated. There is a spot known as Sabari peetam to declare that such episode took place there. This spot has been visited by millions of Ayyappa devotees every year (including me). There is another popularly and strongly believed story about a woman called ‚ÄòDhammakka‚Äô who lived here had a dream wherein Lord Rama appeared and told her that His idol was on the peak of Bhadra hill.  The temple  A painting of the temple's deities Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana in the Yogananda Narasimha temple, Bhadrachalam The temple is divided into three parts. The first is believed to be the head of Bhadra, where a shrine is dedicated to him. Inside, on a rock structure, the supposed footprints of Rama can be seen. Thirunamam(a white clay) is applied to the rock so that the visitors can recognise it as Bhadra's head. The second part of the temple is the sanctum where the central icon resides on a place considered equivalent to Bhadra's heart. The third part is the Rajagopuram (main tower), which is located at Bhadra's feet. The temple has four entrances; there are 50 steps to be climbed to reach the main entrance. In 1974, a huge door named the Vaikuntha Dwaram was built to ensure proper management of the visiting devotees. Directly opposite to the sanctum is a gold-plated dwajasthambam (flag post). It is made of panchaloha (a five-metal alloy), on which are carved images of Garuda, the vehicle of Vishnu. On the top of the vimana of the sanctum is an eight-faced Sudarshana Chakra with a thousand corners, that was engraved by Gopanna, who found it lying in the waters of the Godavari River. On the vimana, a miniature of the temple's deity can be seen. The entrance for devotees, who have purchased a special visit ticket, is towards the left of the sanctum. The regular visitors have to wait in a queue that leads straight into the sanctum. Housed in an area to the right of the sanctum are the festival icons of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana, which are worshipped daily. alt=A black granite construction of a temple tower with a metal disc and miniature at the top The central icon housed in the sanctum is considered Swayambhu (self-manifested). Rama is seated in a padmasana posture, with Sita seated on his lap. Rama's four hands hold the conch, disc, bow, and arrow. Lakshmana stands to his left. On a taller hill, Gopanna installed and consecrated the icon of Ranganatha, a reclining form of Vishnu, which faces the south. The place is popularly known as Ranganayakula Gutta (hillock of Ranganatha). Opposite the Ranganatha sanctum is a temple dedicated to his consort Lakshmi Thayar. These two temples were included by Gopanna to follow the tradition of Srirangam Ranganathaswamy temple. The temple houses a number of other shrines. Hanuman has two shrines in the temple: the Abhayanjaneya temple at the river bank and the Dasanjaneya temple in the Thiruveedhi (divine passage) of Bhadrachalam. In the Rajaveedhi (royal passage) of the temple, a shrine of Govindaraja Swamy (a form of Vishnu) can be found where the festival icons of Bhadrachalam spend some time during the Thiruveedhi utsavam festival procession. On the way to the main temple from the river bank, a shrine is dedicated to Yogananda-Narasimha. The icon is believed to be Swayambhu and very powerful. Next to the Lakshmi Thayar temple is the Rushya Mookham Exhibition centre. In the centre, the Rama mada coins given to the Shah, jewellery made by Gopanna for the deities, and other important items are housed. The jewellery includes the chintaku patakam (a necklace studded with rubies), kirithas (crowns), plaited decorations, and a mutyala haramu (chain of pearls). In the outer ambulatory passage of the temple, there is a hall called the Nithyakalyana mandapam or kalyana mandapam, intended for conducting the marriage festival of Rama and Sita. On the Ranganayakula Gutta is a temple dedicated to the god Shiva, who is worshipped as Ramalingeswaraswamy. Near the kalyana mandapam, there is a hermitage named Govindaswamy matham where many saints stayed in the past. A huge hall named Mithila Stadium was built facing the Vaikuntha Dwaram. Its construction was initiated by Jalagam Vengala Rao and was completed at a cost of 3.8 million. The icons worshipped by Narasimha Dasu are housed in the Ambasatram, which is located at the southern end of the temple. Here, food is served to the devotees visiting the temple.  Religious practices  Bhadrachalam temple entrance According to Ramayana and other sacred texts, Ranganatha was the Kuladevata (tutelary deity) of Rama's clan, the Ikshvaku dynasty. Hence, Gopanna wanted this temple to implement all the traditions and guidelines of the Srirangam temple dedicated to Ranganatha. For the same reason, he invited five families from Srirangam who knew the Pancharatra Agama traditions to Bhadrachalam. With their help, the system of worship followed in the Srirangam temple was implemented here. Narasimha Dasu later introduced the Dasavidhotsavams (ten kinds of rituals), including Nitya Kainkaryams (daily rituals), Vaarotsavams (weekly rituals), Pakshotsavams (fortnightly rituals), and Punarvasu utsavam (rituals on the Punarvasu day). The suprabhata seva (pre-dawn ritual) begins early in the morning at 4:00am, followed by providing Balabhoga (minor food offerings) from 5:30 to 7:00am. From 8:30 to 11:30, the regular archana (prayer) activities are held. Rajabhogam (main food offering) is served to the deity from 11:30am to 12:00noon; then the temple remains closed until 3:00pm. From 3:00, the archana rituals continue, after which darbar seva (the king's court ritual) is performed from 7:00 to 8:00pm. After a break to offer food to the deity from 8:30 to 9:00pm, the temple is closed after performance of the pavalimpu seva (the sleeping ritual). Abhisheka (anointment) in the main sanctum is performed only to Rama's feet on the rock structure in Bhadra's temple. This ritual is also performed to the deities in the Lakshmi, Anjaneya, and Yogananda Narasimha temple exclusively on every Friday, Tuesday, and Saturday, respectively. There are weekly, monthly, and fortnightly rituals performed in the temple apart from the annual ones. Kalyanam (marriage) and Thiruveedhi utsavam (procession festival) are performed at the Ranganayakula Gutta every year for its presiding deity Ranganatha.  Festivals  = Vaikuntha Ekadashi = alt=Four black statuettes housed in a wooden vehicle-like structure The Vaikuntha Ekadashi celebrations are based on the traditions followed in Srirangam. As per the Bhadradri Kshetra Mahatyam (Importance of Bhadradri) in the Brahma Purana, devotees seeking the blessings of Vaikuntha Rama on the annual festival day of Vaikuntha Ekadashi shall be granted salvation. The Agama text named Paramapurusha Samhita states that the devotees must watch Vishnu seated on the procession vehicle of Garuda proceeding from the North gate to fulfill their wish of gaining salvation. As a prelude to Vaikuntha Ekadashi, Teppotsavam (the float festival) is celebrated during which a swan-shaped boat named Hamsavahanam is utilised for the procession of the utsava icons on the waters of the Godavari River. Teppotsavam is held at night under the light of electrical lighting and fireworks. The boat makes five circular rounds in the water, and nearly 26 people accompany the icons in the procession. On the day of Vaikuntha Ekadashi, the utsava idols of Rama, Sita, and Lakshmana are seated on Garudavahanam, and devotees pass through the Vaikuntha Dwaram. Goda Kalyanam and Rathotsavam (the chariot festival) form the other main important activities of the 21-day-long celebrations; the latter coincides with the Makar Sankranti festival. = Vasanthotsavam = Vasanthotsavam (festival of spring) is celebrated to mark the commencement of the preparations for the annual Brahmotsavam (Grand celebration) festival. This festival coincides with Holi and involves the preparation of the mutyala talambralu (talambralu made of pearls and rice; talambralu is a mixture of rice and turmeric used in South-Indian marriage rituals). Natural pearls are mixed with rice grains, the husks of which have been removed with nails, and turmeric powder. This entire mixture is processed by hand. This mixture, with the addition of aromatic ingredients, is known as Goti talambralu (talamralu polished by nails). The event begins with Vaishnava women gathering in the Chitrakoota mandapam hall in the temple's premises and participating in an initial prayer to the traditional grinding equipment. They powder the turmeric seeds using the traditional grinding equipment and use them in the preparation of the Goti talambralu. The icon of Rama is decorated using nine blocks of turmeric powder and other aromatic ingredients. The priests perform Maha Kumbhaprokshana (sanctification of the temple). The water used in the process, known as Vasantha theertham, is sprinkled on the devotees who then celebrate Holi. Dolotsavam (the swing ritual) is performed to conclude Vasanthotsavam by placing the festival icons in a golden cradle and singing lullabies. = Brahmotsavam = alt=A large gate with the signs of Thirunamam, a disc and a conch, atop it The chief temple festival is the twelve-day long annual Brahmotsavam festival (the Vasantha Paksha Prayukta Srirama Navami Brahmotsavam),celebrated during MarchApril. Rama Navami, the birthday of Rama, is the main event of the Brahmotsavam. According to the Pancharatra Agama rules, Rama's marriage with Sita is held on this day; the marriage is performed at a time that signifies the presence of the stars Punarvasu and Abhijit. This festival is formally referred to as Sri Sitarama Thirukalyana Mahotsavam. Brahmotsavam is initiated by performing Visesha Snapanam (a special cleansing) of the festival icons followed by Ankurarpanam (the formal start), listening to the Panchangam dictation, and the Thiruveedhi utsavam. The Dwajapata Bhadraka Mandala Lekhanam, a flag made of white cloth with an image of Garuda, is prepared, and special prayers are performed. The Garuda image, whose eyes are covered with wax, has five colours in it. The flag is worshipped with hymns such as Garudanyasam and Garuda Dhyanam. After placing the flag at the feet of the temple's central icon, it is taken to the Vedi (fire altar) and placed on a heap of rice. The procedure is completed by performing Abhisheka (libation) to the flag with sixteen kalashas containing sacred water. This ritual is referred to as Garudadhivasam (invitating Garuda). alt=A priest holds up a three-disc gold mangala sutra to the audience while others look at the idols. After Garudadhivasam, the priests perform Dwajarohanam (flag hoisting) and start a special fire ritual. Brahmotsavam continues with the Edurukolu (welcoming the bridegroom) event before proceeding to the marriage. The Shah, after releasing Gopanna from jail, started the tradition of sending pearls and silk robes as gifts to Rama and Sita on the eve of the marriage conducted in the temple. This tradition continued uninterrupted throughout the Qutb Shahi reign, and all succeeding governments. These pearls are used along with the Goti talambralu in the Thirukalyana Mahotsavam. The mangala sutra necklace used in this marriage ceremony contains three coin-sized gold discs. According to Telugu tradition, one disc pertains to Dasharatha, Rama's father, and the second one to Janaka, Sita's father. The third one pertains to Gopanna, who considered Sita as his daughter. This three-disc mangala sutra provided by Gopanna is only available in Bhadrachalam and is used even today. After completion of the marriage ceremony, Mahapattabishekam (the coronation ceremony) and Teppotsavam are held. Brahmotsavam ends with the completion of Sripushpayagam (flower worship). = Vijayadashami = The ten-day Dussehra is one of the key festivals celebrated in Bhadrachalam. The Ramayana is read for ten days daily during the ritual of a yagna, which ends on the tenth day and is referred to as Vijayadashami. The rituals are performed in the Lakshmi Thayar temple according to the rules of the Pancharatra Agama. On Vijayadashami, the nijaroopa darshanam (true form darshan) of Lakshmi Thayar attracts thousands of devotees. In the morning, Abhisheka and Sahasranama archana (recital of a thousand attributes) are performed to Lakshmi Thayar. The key events of the Dussehra celebrations are the marriage and coronation of Rama followed by special prayers to his weapons and the Shami tree (prosopis cineraria). After the completion of the yagna, Rama's idol is dressed like that of an emperor and is carried out in a procession on the vehicles of Gaja (elephant) and Aswa (horse). As a part of the weapon worship, Rama's conch, disc, bow, and mace are used. Arrows representing the powers of the vedic deities Indra, Yama, Varuna, and Kubera are also made a part of the worship. The event ends with the traditional Ramlila ceremony conducted at night. = Other festivals = The other prominent festivals celebrated at Bhadrachalam are Hanuman Jayanti, Sabari Smruti Yatra, and Dhammakka Seva Yatra. Hanuman Jayanti is celebrated at the Dasanjaneya temple, with leaf worship and Thiruveedhi utsavam being the main events. Devotees mark the conclusion of their Hanuman Deeksha by untying the Irumudi (sacred bundle) before Rama and offering it at the Dasanjaneya temple. For Sabari Smruti Yatra, members of local tribes sport distinctive head gear and clothing. They sing and dance to the drum beats and display their archery skills. The main event of Dhammakka Seva Yatra is the marriage of Govindaraja Swamy and his consorts. Special performers among the members of tribes from 29 mandals around Bhadrachalam offer floral tributes to Dhammakka's statue. They offer talambralu to the deity in addition to flowers and fruits, and perform traditional dances. Apart from these, the jayanthi utsavam (birthday) of Gopanna and Narasimha Dasu are also celebrated annually.  Religious significance  Maha Pushkaram at Bhadrachalam in 2015alt=Large groups of people standing on the banks of a river in the afternoon Bhadrachalam is often referred to as Dakshina Ayodhya (\\"Southern Ayodhya\\"); Ayodhya being the capital of Rama. The iconography of the Vaikuntha Rama form of Rama, is unique and not found anywhere else in the country. The Brahma Purana makes special mention of the temple's significance and adds that Vaikuntha Rama is capable of imparting knowledge to those who worship him at Bhadrachalam. The Hindu saints Adi Shankara and Thirumangai Alvar visited the temple and offered prayers to the deity. Bhadrachalam is considered as one of the Divya Kshetrams (special temples) that sit on the banks of the Godavari River. Hence, the river's Pushkaram and Maha Pushkaram are celebrated here along with others once every twelve years and 144 years, respectively. As per legend, when a Muslim saint Kabir who was also a devotee of Rama, was once denied entry into the temple by the priests. The images of the temple disappeared for the moment. Ramadass who was there pleaded with the priests to let the saint inside the temple, after which the icons appeared again. Gopanna used Bhadrachalam as a centre of the Bhajan tradition to spread awareness of the Vaishnavite tradition. This eventually led to the increase in the number of Rama temples in the Telugu-speaking states across the years, especially in villages. Gopanna's songs inspired Tyagaraja, another ardent devotee of Rama who composed several songs in Indian carnatic music. Tyagaraja revered Gopanna as his \\"personal hero\\", and he composed several songs modelled on songs written by Gopanna in praise of Vaikuntha Rama. He later inspired Narasimha Dasu, who composed songs in praise of Rama during his stay at Bhadrachalam. It helped Narasimha Dasu gain recognition as a true follower of Gopanna. The annual tradition of giving pearls and silk robes to Rama on the day of his marriage celebrations has been replicated at many other smaller temples dedicated to the deity.

From 2002 until 2008, Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau was held on the Marian Mawr, a large grassy area next to Afon Wnion.BBC Article It was during this period that Sesiwn Fawr reached its peak audience figures with sell out crowds of approximately 5,000 attending each year. In 2007 and 2008, the festival was blighted by bad weather resulting in poor ticket sales, and as with a number of Welsh festivals, there was no Sesiwn Fawr in 2009.No Sesiwn Fawr Dolgellau in 2009 Daily Post 5.3.2009 In 2011, however, Sesiwn Fawr returned to the festival calendar although on a smaller scale than the 2002‚Äì08 Sesiwn Fawr and far closer to its early 1990s roots.. The organisers decided to return to a primarily folky line-up which included Mynediad am Ddim, Cowbois Rhos Botwnnog, Calan and Steve Eaves. The 2011 Sesiwn Fawr also included a twmpath dawns (a large communal folk dance) on the town's Eldon Square on the following Saturday. After receiving positive reviews, organisers decided to follow a similar format again for 2012. Since 2012, Sesiwn Fawr has returned to Eldon Square, the festival's spiritual home, introducing bands from Wales, Brittany, Ireland, Scotland and England. During the next few years, organisers explored other venues within the town making use of hidden away court yards, cellar bars and coffee shops, thus rebuilding a festival around Dolgellau's historical architecture. In the past, the line-up has included Super Furry Animals, Steve Earle, The Dubliners Iwcs a Doyle, Burning Spear, Bob Geldof, Saw Doctors, Bryn F√¥n, Meic Stevens, Geraint Jarman a'r Cynghaneddwyr, Derwyddon Dr Gonzo, Grupo Fantasma, Paul Dooley, N'Faly Kouyate, Endaf Emlyn, Cerys Matthews and Goldie Lookin Chain.  Welsh Event of the Year Award/ The Greatest Show in Wales  The folk festival was winner in 2000 of the Wales Tourist Board's Welsh Event of the Year Award, sponsored by This Week the national tourism newspaper for Wales and rebranded The Greatest Show in Wales. The Award was made in the face of stiff competition from a South Wales golfing event, which was heavily tipped to win. The judges were unanimous, however, in considering Sesiwn Fawr to be a uniquely Welsh experience for visitors in June to this old Meirionnydd town; a celebration of Welsh culture at its best, and a prime example of how, via tourism, culture can drive economic growth in a community. The festival sat perfectly within the new strategy for arts and culture in Wales and was set to emerge onto a wider stage, strengthening rather than foregoing its sense of local identity as it progressed.

Background  Frustrated by the loss of his Italian possessions after the War of the Spanish Succession, King Philip V of Spain had invaded Sardinia, now in Austrian possession in August 1717 and Sicily, which had been awarded to the Duke of Savoy, in July 1718. He was taking advantage of the power vacuum in France after the death of Louis XIV, and the fact that Austria was tied up in the Austro-Turkish War of 1716‚Äì18. But on July 21, 1718 the Treaty of Passarowitz ended the war with Turkey and on August 2, this led to the formation of the Quadruple Alliance against Spain, between Austria, Britain, the Dutch Republic, and France. Meanwhile, the Spanish, with 30,000 men under command of the Marquis of Lede, had taken the whole island, with the exception of the area around Messina, which was besieged since July 18. On August 11, at the Battle of Cape Passaro, a British fleet, led by Sir George Byng, attacked and destroyed the Spanish fleet. On October 13 this British fleet landed an Austrian army, assembled in Naples by the Austrian Viceroy Count Wirich Philipp von Daun near Milazzo, to lift the siege by the Spanish forces. This led to the battle on October 15.  The battle  The Austrians attacked very early in the morning, taking the Spanish by surprise. The two Spanish Dragoon regiments (Batavia and Lusitania) stopped the attack, to give the rest of the Spanish army time to deploy. Both regiments were decimated, but their sacrifice gave Lede the opportunity to counterattack. The Austrians were pushed back and the Spanish pursued the fleeing army, causing many casualties. The Austrians lost 1,500 killed or wounded and 300 prisoners. The Spanish lost 1,500 killed or wounded and 200 prisoners. Messina was taken by the Spanish, but the Marquis de Lede didn't take to opportunity to drive the Austrians completely from the island, leaving them a bridgehead around Milazzo. This bridgehead and naval supremacy after the Battle of Cape Passaro, gave the Austrians a chance to send over more troops the next year, leading to the Battle of Francavilla.
