Old English poetry. The scop is the Old English counterpart of the Old Norse ', with the important difference that \\"skald\\" was applied to historical persons, and scop is used, for the most part, to designate oral poets within Old English literature. Very little is known about the mythical scop, and its historical existence is questioned by some scholars.  Functions  The scop, like the similar gleeman, was a reciter of poetry. The scop, however, was typically attached to a court on a relatively permanent basis. There, he most likely received rich gifts for his performances. The performances often featured the recitation of recognisable texts such as the \\"old pagan legends of the Germanic tribes.\\" However, the scop's duties also included composing his own poetry in different situations, the eulogizing of his master. While some scops moved from court to court, they were (generally speaking) less nomadic than the gleemen and had positions of greater security.  Etymology  Old English ' and its cognate Old High German ' (glossing ' and '; also ') may be related to the verb ' \\"to create, form\\" (Old Norse ', Old High German '; Modern English shape), from Proto-Germanic ' \\"form, order\\" (from a PIE ' \\"cut, hack\\"), perfectly parallel to the notion of craftsmanship expressed by the Greek ' itself;suggested e.g. by Alexander 1966 K√∂bler (1993, p. 220) suggests that the West Germanic word may indeed be a calque of Latin '.  Scop, ', and relationship to scold While ' became English scoff, the Old Norse ' lives on in a Modern English word of a similarly deprecating meaning, scold. There is a homonymous Old High German ' meaning \\"abuse, derision\\" (Old Norse ', meaning \\"mocking, scolding\\", whence scoff), a third meaning \\"tuft of hair\\", and yet another meaning \\"barn\\" (cognate to English shop). They may all derive from a Proto-Germanic '. The association with jesting or mocking was, however, strong in Old High German. There was a ' glossing both ' and ' and a ' glossing ' and '. ', on the other hand, is of a higher register, glossing '. The words involving jesting are derived from another root, Proto-Indo-European *- \\"push, thrust\\", related to English shove, shuffle, and the Oxford English Dictionary favours association of ' with that root. The question cannot be decided formally since the Proto-Germanic forms coincided in zero grade, and by the time of the surviving sources (from the late 8th century), the association with both roots may have influenced the word for several centuries. It is characteristic of the Germanic tradition of poetry that the sacred or heroic cannot be separated from the ecstatic or drunken state and so crude jesting (compare the Lokasenna, where the poet humorously depicts the gods themselves as quarrelsome and malicious), qualities summed up in the concept of ', the namegiving attribute of the god of poetry, '.  Mystery of Anglo-Saxon scop  Professor of Literature at University of California San Diego, Seth Lerer, suggests, \\"What we have come to think of as the inherently 'oral' quality of Old English Poetry... [may] be a literary fiction of its own.\\" Early English scholars have different opinions on whether or not the Anglo-Saxon oral poet ever really existed. Much of the poetry that survives does have an oral quality to it, but some scholars argue that it is a trait carried over from an earlier Germanic period. If, as some critics believe, the idea of the Anglo-Saxon oral poet is based on the Old Norse Skald, it can be seen as a link to the heroic past of the Germanic peoples. There is no proof that the \\"scop\\" existed, and it could be a literary device allowing poetry to give an impression of orality and performance. This poet figure recurs throughout the literature of the period, whether real or not. Examples are the poems Widsith and Deor, in the Exeter Book, which draw on the idea of the mead-hall poet of the heroic age and, along with the anonymous heroic poem Beowulf express some of the strongest poetic connections to oral culture in the literature of the period.

It was first written in 1758 under the editorship of Edmund Burke, and has been produced continuously since that date. In its current form the first half of the book comprises articles on each of the world's countries or regions, while the latter half contains articles on international organisations, economics, the environment, science, law, religion, the arts and sport, together with obituaries, a chronicle of major events and selected documents. In addition to being produced annually in hardback, the book is also published electronically, and its entire 250-year archive is available online from its publisher, ProQuest. Edmund Burke and the creation of The Annual Register The Annual Register was created in 1758 by the publishers James and Robert Dodsley. On 24 April 1758 the Dodsley brothers signed a contract with Edmund Burke (1729‚Äì97) to write and edit the material for The Annual Register, which was conceived as an annual publication which would review the history, politics and literature of the day. Born in Ireland, Burke had trained as a lawyer before abandoning this field and turning to writing. He was an up-and-coming member of the intelligentsia and had already written several notable works, published by Dodsley. According to his contract with Dodsley, Burke was paid ¬£100 per annum as editor of The Annual Register.Thomas W. Copeland, Edmund Burke: Six Essays (London, 1950), p. 94. In its original form, The Annual Register comprised a long historical essay on the ‚ÄúHistory of the Present War‚Äù (the Seven Years' War 1756‚Äì63), a Chronology, which gave an account of interesting and noteworthy events in Britain over the previous year, and a collection of ‚ÄúState Papers‚Äù, a miscellany of primary source material which included official documents, speeches, letters and accounts. In his preface to the 1758 volume Burke noted the difficulties he had faced in writing the history section of the book. Taking the ‚Äúbroken and unconnected materials‚Äù and creating from them ‚Äúone connected narrative‚Äù had been, he commented, ‚Äúa work of more labour than may at first appear‚Äù.The Annual Register, for the year 1758, p. iii. Nevertheless, his perseverance and skill as an historian meant that by the time of its publication the first volume of The Annual Register contained a unique, contemporaneous account of the war, analysing its origins and development with a perspective not readily available at the time in newspapers or magazines. As a result, the book sold widely, with the first volume going through five editions in its first 10 years.T.O. McLoughlin, Edmund Burke and the First Ten Years of the Annual Register 1758‚Äì1767 (Salisbury, 1975), p. 8. Given the conventions of the day, within which journalism was seen as a disreputable profession for a gentleman, Burke was publicly reticent about his connection with The Annual Register. However, his biographers are in agreement that Burke wrote and edited the book single-handedly until 1765, when he entered Parliament. From this time Thomas English was closely involved in writing the book and is regarded by some authorities as having taken over the editorship from Burke in that year.William B. Todd, A Bibliographical Account of the Annual Register, 1758‚Äì1825 (London, 1961), p. 106. Scholars are divided on the question of Burke's association with the book thereafter, although many suggest that he continued to contribute to the history section and that he played a significant role in overseeing The Annual Registers compilation until the 1790s, even though much of the editorial work by this stage was being done by others.McLoughlin, p. 52. Competing editions By the 1760s The Annual Register had established itself as amongst the most respected journals in print. However, the immense scale of the work meant that its early years were characterised by frequent delays in publication and a chaotic period in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries when there were two competing versions of the title, each claiming to be its legitimate incarnation. Having been created in 1758, The Annual Register was published by the Dodsley brothers until 1763 and, following Robert Dodsley's death, by James Dodsley alone until 1790. The sequence of Dodsley volumes was confused, however, by the practice of falsely dating a number of first editions in order to conceal the increasing delays (on occasions up to three years) between the year of publication and the year of the events described within a particular volume. A number of reprints and ‚Äúcounterfeit firsts‚Äù were also issued during the Dodsley period.Todd, p. 107. Following the publication of the 1790 volume in December 1793, Dodsley disposed of The Annual Register. He sold the stock and copyright of the volumes already issued to Messrs Otridge and assigned responsibility for future volumes to another publisher, Rivington. Under the new publisher the delays increased further, with the 1792 volume of the ‚ÄúGenuine‚Äù Annual Register not appearing until September 1798 (three months after the death of Thomas English) and the 1793 volume not being printed until July 1806. During this period Otridge produced volumes of its own ‚ÄúOriginal‚Äù Annual Register, covering the missing years and selling them at 8 shillings, compared with the 13 shillings charged by Rivington. Faced with this competition from a rival with greater resources, Rivington attempted to make good the arrears while also bringing out subsequent volumes more promptly. Some ground was recovered, although a number of years had still not been produced (1813‚Äì19) when Rivington finally went into partnership with Baldwin Craddock and Joy, a publisher which had already acquired a major share of Otridge in 1815. Thus, from the 1825 edition (produced in 1826) the competing Annual Registers were combined by Baldwin and Co. into a single title.Todd, pp. 104, 108. Subsequent developments During the remainder of the nineteenth century The Annual Register was published without major difficulty. Following the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815, it had adopted a format which gave a number of chapters to the history of Britain and followed closely the proceedings of Parliament. There followed chapters covering other countries in turn, no longer confined only to Europe. Its expanded history section meant that there was less of the miscellaneous material which had characterised its earlier volumes. Nevertheless, poetry remained included until 1862 and the book continued to reflect topical issues of the day. In 1947 The Annual Register acquired an advisory board for the first time consisting of the then editor, Ivison Macadam, the assistant editor, Hugh Latimer, and five representatives nominated by: the English Association, the Arts Council of Great Britain, the British Association for the Advancement of Science, the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and the Royal Historical Society. Explaining this innovation, Macadam stated in the preface to the 1947 volume that it was ‚Äúa recognition of the need for specialisation in these complicated times‚Äù.The Annual Register, vol. 189, (London, 1948), p. ix. In 1994, after a century's ownership by Longman, The Annual Register was transferred to Cartermill. In 1996 it was sold to a US publisher, Keesing's Worldwide, which oversaw the process of digitising the book's extensive archive and making this available for the first time to subscribers. In late 2005 the title was bought by another US publisher, Cambridge Scientific Abstracts, which subsequently became ProQuest. =List of editors= Although it is agreed that Edmund Burke was the first editor of The Annual Register and held the post from 1758 to 1765, the date upon which he relinquished the editorship is uncertain. It is only possible to record with accuracy those editors of the book from the modern period. The following list shows which volumes were produced by specific editors. * M. Epstein (1922‚Äì1945) * H.T. Montague Bell (1946) * Ivison S. Macadam (1947‚Äì1972) * Harry Hodson (1973‚Äì1987) * Alan J. Day (1988‚Äì1999) * D.S. Lewis (2000‚Äì2009) * D.S. Lewis & Wendy Slater (2010‚Äìpresent) The Annual Register today Cover of The Annual Register of 1974 =Editorial aims= The Annual Register in its current form aims to provide an authoritative, accurate, and interesting summary of the history of the year. This includes charting the immediate history of individual countries and also covering developments across a broad spectrum of science and the humanities. It aims to maintain The Annual Register‚Äôs traditional role as a well-respected reference work, while also providing an interesting and lively read. =Modern format= The Annual Register begins with an overview of the year, a thought-provoking essay by an established modern historian. In recent years, the authors of this article have included Paul Rogers, Anatol Lieven, Philip M.H. Bell, M.R.D. Foot, Richard Overy, and J.M. Roberts. There then follow articles on each country (or group of countries) in the world, ranging from a few hundred to 10,000 words in length. The second half of the book contains articles on major international and regional organisations, and essays on various topics. These include developments in the international economy, science and the environment, law and religion, and the arts and sport. The final sections of the book contain selected documents and statistics, an obituary section, and a day-by-day chronicle of the year‚Äôs events. A number of maps and colour photographs are included to illustrate the year‚Äôs key stories. =Contributors= Each article is written by an expert in that field. Of the ninety or so contributors, some of whom have written for The Annual Register for 40 years, the vast majority are academics or journalists. Although the contributors are scattered throughout the world, the publisher invites them to an annual dinner, which serves as a forum for discussion of the book, and at which a traditional toast ‚Äúto the immortal memory of Edmund Burke‚Äù is still drunk in port, after the meal. =Advisory board members= The current advisory board of The Annual Register consists of the joint editors (D.S. Lewis and Wendy Slater), and the following luminaries, who are nominated by various learned societies. *Chairman: Alastair Niven, LVO, OBE, Fellow, Harris Manchester College, University of Oxford (nominated by the British Council) *Mark Furneaux, formerly Managing Director, European Operations, CSA (nominated by the chairman) *Richard O'Brien (nominated by the Royal Economic Society) *David Reynolds, FBA, Professor of International History, University of Cambridge (nominated by the Royal Historical Society) *Caroline Soper, Series editor, Insights (nominated by the Royal Institute of International Affairs) *Neil Weir, FRCS, consultant otolaryngologist (nominated by the Royal Society of Medicine) *Lorelly Wilson, FRSC, MBE, honorary teaching fellow, University of Manchester (nominated by the British Science Association) The annual board meetings are also attended by representatives of the publisher. =Current editors= The current editor is D.S. Lewis. He studied history and economics at Manchester University, and took his PhD there in 1983. In 1987 he published Illusions of Grandeur: Mosley, Fascism and British Society (MUP), and from 1997 to 2007 he served as editor of Keesing‚Äôs Record of World Events. He became chairman of the Advisory Board of The Annual Register in 1999 but stepped down in the following year upon becoming the book's editor. The deputy editor is Wendy Slater. She read Russian at the University of Cambridge and Soviet studies at Manchester. After several years in journalism she obtained her PhD from Cambridge in 1998, and from 1999 to 2003 was lecturer in Russian contemporary history at the UCL School of Slavonic and East European Studies (SSEES), a post which she left after becoming deputy editor of The Annual Register in 2002. In 2007, she published The Many Deaths of Nicholas II: Relics, remains and the Romanovs (Routledge). =Current publisher= The Annual Register is currently published by ProQuest. The company (then called CSA) bought the title in late 2005 from Keesing's Worldwide. =Winner of 2008 reference award= In 2008 the board of judges of the Specialized Information Publishers Association (SIPA) awarded The Annual Register the 2008 Best Reference Publication prize for its \\"editorial excellence\\". =Online archive= The entire archive of The Annual Register is currently available to subscribers online. This includes every volume published since 1758 and is updated annually when each new volume is completed. Each page has been scanned. Text has been captured through OCR (optical character recognition) for the earlier volumes, while recent volumes have text taken directly from the files used for the print publication. The online version includes contents tables and indexes to enable users to browse individual volumes. It also allows for keyword searches within the whole text. The Edmund Burke Lectures Since 2011, the publisher has hosted a yearly lecture by a person eminent in one of the fields covered by The Annual Register. The lecture is delivered before an invited audience, at the London headquarters of one of the institutions that nominate members of the Advisory Board. =The Edmund Burke lecturers 2011‚Äì2017= *Eugene Rogan, Professor of Modern Middle Eastern History, University of Oxford. **\\"After 2011: The New Middle East\\" *Paul Rogers, Professor of Peace Studies, Bradford University. **\\"The Limits of Foreign Military Intervention\\" *Jeremy Farrar, Director, the Wellcome Trust. **\\"Global Health: Challenges and Opportunities\\" *Sir Paul Nurse, Chief Executive and Director, the Francis Crick Institute. **\\"Trust in Science\\" *Sir Ciar√°n Devane, Chief Executive, the British Council. **\\"Reflections on the Revolution in Britain: Brexit, Identity, and the United Kingdom‚Äôs Place in the World\\" *David Reynolds, Professor of International History, University of Cambridge **\\"Reflections on the Revolutions in Russia, 1917-2017\\" See also *The Statesman's Yearbook *New Annual Register References Further reading * Murdoch, David H. ed.

It is an evergreen shrub growing to tall by wide, with pinnate leaves consisting of spiny leaflets, and dense clusters of yellow flowers in early spring, followed by dark bluish-black berries. Etymology The specific epithet aquifolium denotes \\"sharp-leafed\\" (as in Ilex aquifolium, the common holly), referring to the spiny foliage. The common name is often, and always in the United Kingdom, left unhyphenated as \\"Oregon grape\\", though doing so invites confusion with the true grapes. Some authors avoid this confusion by using \\"Oregon grape- holly\\" or \\"Oregon holly-grape\\" as a vernacular name for any species of Mahonia. It is also occasionally printed as \\"Oregongrape\\". Mahonia aquifolium is not closely related to either the true holly (Ilex aquifolium) or the true grape (Vitis vinifera cv.). Several common species of Oregon-grape are known, and many have numerous cultivars. Among these are tall Oregon grape (Mahonia aquifolium); Cascade, low, dull, or dwarf Oregon grape (M. nervosa); and creeping Oregon grape (M. repens). Description Mahonia aquifolium grows to tall by wide, with pinnate leaves up to long, each leaf made up of spiny leaflets. The leathery leaves resemble those of holly and the stems and twigs have a thickened, corky appearance. The flowers, borne in dense clusters in late spring, are yellow, and are followed by spherical dark dusty blue berries, which give rise to the common name \\"Oregon grape\\". Taxonomy Some authors place Mahonia in the barberry genus, Berberis.Flora of North America, vol 3Loconte, H., & J. R. Estes. 1989.

Transfer of specific and infraspecific taxa from Mahonia to Berberis. Bot. Zhurn. 82(9):96-99. The Oregon-grape is not related to true grapes, but gets its name from the purple clusters of berries whose color and slightly dusted appearance are reminiscent of grapes. The yellow flowers are in a raceme 3‚Äì8 cm long. Bombus species and other insects pollinate the flowers. Each of the six stamens, opposite the petals, terminates in two spreading branches. The six bright yellow petals are enclosed by six bright yellow sepals. At the base of the flower are three greenish-yellow bracts. Less than half as long as the sepals, only one is partially visible. Distribution Mahonia aquifolium is a native plant in the North American West from Southeast Alaska to Northern California, and eastern Alberta to central New Mexico, often occurring in the understory of Douglas fir forests (although other forest types contain the species) and in brushlands in the Cascades, Rockies, and northern Sierras. In some areas outside its native range, M. aquifolium has been classified as an invasive exotic species that may displace native vegetation.Plants to Avoid in the Southeastern United States Tennessee Invasive Exotic Plant List Cultivation Mahonia aquifolium is a popular subject in shady or woodland plantings. It is valued for its striking foliage and flowers, which often appear before those of other shrubs. It is resistant to summer drought, tolerates poor soils, and does not create excessive leaf litter. Its berries attract birds. Numerous cultivars and hybrids have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: * M. √ó wagneri 'Pinnacle' (M. aquifolium √ó M. pinnata) * 'Apollo' Uses The small purplish-black fruits, which are quite tart and contain large seeds, are included in smaller quantities in the traditional diets of Pacific Northwest indigenous peoples, mixed with salal or another sweeter fruit. Today, they are sometimes used to make jelly, alone or mixed with salal. Oregon-grape juice can be fermented to make wine, similar to European barberry wine folk traditions, although it requires an unusually high amount of sugar. The berries can also be eaten raw after the season's first frosts. The inner bark of the larger stems and roots of Oregon grape yields a yellow dye; the berries give purple dye. As the leaves of Oregon grape are holly-like and resist wilting, the foliage is sometimes used by florists for greenery and a small gathering industry has been established in the Pacific Northwest. =Herbal medicine= Some Indigenous peoples of the Northwest Plateau use Oregon grape for indigestion. Chemical constituents Mahonia aquifolium contains 5'-methoxyhydnocarpin (5'-MHC), a multidrug resistance pump inhibitor, which works to decrease bacterial resistance in vitro. Culture Oregon-grape is the state flower of Oregon.

It produced an early time-sharing system including the Berkeley Timesharing System, which was then commercialized as the SDS 940. History Project Genie was funded by J. C. R. Licklider, the head of DARPA at that time. The project was a smaller counterpart to MIT's Project MAC. The Scientific Data Systems SDS 940 was created by modifying an SDS 930 24-bit commercial computer so that it could be used for timesharing. The work was funded by ARPA and directed by Melvin W. Pirtle and Wayne Lichtenberger at UC Berkeley. Butler Lampson, Chuck Thacker, and L. Peter Deutsch were among the young technical leaders of that project. When completed and in service, the first 940 ran reliably in spite of its array of tricky mechanical issues such as a huge disk drive driven by hydraulic arms. It served about forty or fifty users at a time and still managed to drive a graphics subsystem that was quite capable for its time. When SDS realized the value of the time sharing system, and that the software was in the public domain (funded by the US federal government), they came back to Berkeley and collected enough information to begin manufacturing. Because SDS manufacturing was overloaded with the 9 series production and the startup of the Sigma Series production, it could not incorporate the 940 modifications into the standard production line. Instead, production of the 940s was turned over to the Systems Engineering Department, which manufactured systems customised to user requirements. To produce a 940, the Systems Engineering Department ordered a 930 from SDS manufacturing, installed the modifications developed by the Berkeley engineers, and shipped machine to the SDS customer as a 940. Project Genie pioneered several computer hardware techniques, such as commercial time-sharing which allowed end-user programming in machine language, separate protected user modes, memory paging, and protected memory. Concepts from Project Genie influenced the development of the TENEX operating system for the PDP-10, and Unix, which inherited the concept of process forking from it (Unix co-creator Ken Thompson worked on an SDS 940 while at Berkeley). An SDS 940 mainframe was used by Douglas Engelbart's OnLine System at the Stanford Research Institute and was the first computer used by the Community Memory Project at Berkeley. A follow-on project was called CalTSS for a dual-processor CDC 6400 which ended quickly in 1969. Several members of project Genie such as Pirtle, Thacker, Deutsch and Lampson left UCB to form the Berkeley Computer Corporation (BCC), which produced one prototype, the BCC-500. After BCC went bankrupt after the recession of 1969‚Äì70, the BCC-500 was transferred to the University of Hawaii, where it continued in use through the 1970s. It became part of the ALOHAnet. Several BCC employees became the core of Xerox PARC's computer research group (Deutsch, Lampson and Thacker) in 1970. Lichtenberger went to the University of Hawaii, and was an early employee at Cisco Systems. Pirtle became technical director for the ILLIAC IV project at NASA Ames Research Center.

Son of the well-known Swiss architect Jean Tschumi and a French mother, Tschumi is a dual French-Swiss national who works and lives in New York City and Paris. He studied in Paris and at ETH in Zurich, where he received his degree in architecture in 1969. Career Tschumi has taught in the UK and the USA; at Portsmouth University in Portsmouth and the Architectural Association in London, the Institute for Architecture and Urban Studies in New York, Princeton University, the Cooper Union in New York and Columbia University where he was Dean of the Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation from 1988 to 2003. Tschumi is a permanent US resident. Tschumi's first notable project was the Parc de la Villette, a competition project he won in 1983. Other projects include the new Acropolis Museum, Rouen Concert Hall, and Bridge in La Roche-sur-Yon. Over his almost forty-year career, his built accomplishments number over sixty, including theoretical projects. Tschumi studied at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Z√ºrich, Switzerland where he received an architecture degree in 1969. After school and prior to winning the Parc de La Villette competition, he built his reputation as a theorist through his writings and drawings. From 1988 to 2003 he was the Dean of Columbia University's Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation. Additionally, academic teaching positions have been held at Princeton University, Cooper Union, and the Architectural Association in London. In 1996, he received the French Grand Prix National d'Architecture. He established his practice in 1983 in Paris with the Parc de La Villette competition commission. In 1988, he opened Bernard Tschumi Architects (BTA), headquartered in New York City. In 2002, Bernard Tschumi urbanistes Architectes (BtuA) was established in Paris. =Theory=  1960s‚Äì70s  Throughout his career as an architect, theorist, and academic, Bernard Tschumi's work has reevaluated architecture's role in the practice of personal and political freedom. Since the 1970s, Tschumi has argued that there is no fixed relationship between architectural form and the events that take place within it. The ethical and political imperatives that inform his work emphasize the establishment of a proactive architecture which non- hierarchically engages balances of power through programmatic and spatial devices. In Tschumi's theory, architecture's role is not to express an extant social structure, but to function as a tool for questioning that structure and revising it. The experience of the May 1968 uprisings and the activities of the Situationist International oriented Tschumi's approach to design studios and seminars he taught at the Architectural Association in London during the early 1970s. Within that pedagogical context he combined film and literary theory with architecture, expanding on the work of such thinkers as Roland Barthes and Michel Foucault, in order to reexamine architecture's responsibility in reinforcing unquestioned cultural narratives. A big influence on this work were the theories and structural diagramming by the Russian cinematographer Sergei Eisenstein produced for his own films. Tschumi adapted Eisenstein's diagrammatic methodology in his investigations to exploit the interstitial condition between the elements of which a system is made of: space, event, and movement (or activity). Best exemplified in his own words as, \\"the football player skates across the battlefield.\\" In this simple statement he was highlighting the dislocation of orientation and any possibility of a singular reading; a common resultant of the post- structuralist project. This approach unfolded along two lines in his architectural practice: first, by exposing the conventionally defined connections between architectural sequences and the spaces, programs, and movement which produce and reiterate these sequences; and second, by inventing new associations between space and the events that 'take place' within it through processes of defamiliarization, de-structuring, superimposition, and cross programming. Tschumi's work in the later 1970s was refined through courses he taught at the Architectural Association and projects such as The Screenplays (1977) and The Manhattan Transcripts (1981) and evolved from montage techniques taken from film and techniques of the nouveau roman. His use of event montage as a technique for the organization of program (systems of space, event, and movement, as well as visual and formal techniques) challenged the work other contemporary architects were conducting which focused on montage techniques as purely formal strategies. Tschumi's work responded as well to prevalent strands of contemporary architectural theory that had reached a point of closure, either through a misunderstanding of post-structuralist thought, or the failure of the liberal/leftist dream of successful political and cultural revolution. For example, Superstudio, one such branch of theoretically oriented architectural postmodernists, began to produce ironic, unrealizable projects such as the 1969 Continuous Monument project, which functioned as counter design and critique of the existing architecture culture, suggesting the end of architecture's capacity to effect change on an urban or cultural scale. Tschumi positioned his work to suggest alternatives to this endgame. In 1978 he published an essay entitled The Pleasure of Architecture in which he used sexual intercourse as a characterizing analogy for architecture. He claimed that architecture by nature is fundamentally useless, setting it apart from \\"building\\". He demands a glorification of architectural uselessness in which the chaos of sensuality and the order of purity combine to form structures that evoke the space in which they are built. He distinguishes between the forming of knowledge and the knowledge of form, contending that architecture is too often dismissed as the latter when it can often be used as the former. Tschumi used this essay as a precursor to a later eponymous series of writings detailing the so-called limits of architecture.  1980s‚Äì90s  Blue Condominium in New York City (2007) Tschumi's winning entry for the 1982 Parc de la Villette Competition in Paris became his first major public work and made possible an implementation of the design research and theory which had been rehearsed in The Manhattan Transcripts and The Screenplays. Landscaping, spatial and programmatic sequences in the park were used to produce sites of alternative social practice that challenged the expected use values usually reinforced by a large urban park in Paris. Tschumi has continued this design agenda in a variety of design competitions and built projects since 1983. The 1986 Tokyo National Theater and Opera House project continued the research that Tschumi began in The Manhattan Transcripts, importing notational techniques from experimental dance and musical scores, and using the design process itself to challenge habitual ways of thinking about space, in contrast to earlier static, two dimensional representational techniques which delineated the outline of a building but not the intensity of life within it. At a local scale in his 1990 Video Pavilion at Groningen, transparent walls and tilted floors produce an intense dislocation of the subject in relation to norms like wall, interior and exterior, and horizon. At the urban scale in such projects as the 1992 Le Fresnoy, Studio National des Arts Contemporains, in Tourcoing, France, and the 1995 architecture school at Marne la Vallee, France (both completed 1999), larger spaces challenge normative program sequence and accepted use. The Le Fresnoy complex accomplishes this by its use of the space between the roofs of existing buildings and an added, huge umbrella roof above them which creates an interstitial zone of program on ramps and catwalks. This zone is what Tschumi calls the in-between, a negation of pure form or style that had been practiced in the 1989 ZKM Karlsruhe competition project, where a large atrium space punctuated by encapsulated circulation and smaller program episodes developed a more local network of interstitial space. The capacity of an overlap of programs to effect a reevaluation of architecture on an urban scale had also been tested in the 1988 Kansai Airport competition, Lausanne Bridge city, and 1989 Biblioth√®que de France competition. In the Biblioth√®que de France, a major aspect of the proposed scheme was a large public running track and sports facility on the roof of the complex, intersecting with upper floors of the library program so that neither the sports program nor the intellectual program could exist without an impact on the other. With these projects Tschumi opposed the methods used by architects for centuries to geometrically evaluate facade and plan composition. In this way he suggested that habitual routines of daily life could be more effectively challenged by a full spectrum of design tactics ranging from shock to subterfuge: by regulating events, a more subtle and sophisticated regime of defamiliarizations was produced than by aesthetic and symbolic systems of shock. The extreme limit-conditions of architectural program became criteria to evaluate a building's capacity to function as a device capable of social organization.  2010s  Acropolis Museum Tschumi's critical understanding of architecture remains at the core of his practice today. By arguing that there is no space without event, he designs conditions for a reinvention of living, rather than repeating established aesthetic or symbolic conditions of design. Through these means architecture becomes a frame for \\"constructed situations,\\" a notion informed by the theory, city mappings and urban designs of the Situationist International. Responding to the absence of ethical structure and the disjunction between use, form, and social values by which he characterizes the postmodern condition, Tschumi's design research encourages a wide range of narratives and ambiences to emerge and to self organize. Although his conclusion is that no essentially meaningful relationship exists between a space and the events which occur within it, Tschumi nonetheless aligns his work with Foucault's notion that social structures should be evaluated not according to an a priori notion of good or evil but for their danger to each other. In this way, Tschumi's work is ethologically motivated, in the sense that Deleuze uses the term to propose an emergent ethics that depends on a reevaluation of self/identity and body. Freedom is thus defined by the enhanced range of capacity of this extended body/self in conjunction with an extended self-awareness. By advocating recombinations of program, space, and cultural narrative, Tschumi asks the user to critically reinvent him/herself as a subject. Tschumi, well known for his radical theories on post- structuralist architecture in the 1960s and ‚Äô70s, won the commission for the New Acropolis Museum in a competition. The museum offers a seemingly placid stance, focused on the impressive Athenian light and landscape while remaining precise in imagination and sophisticated in form. =Criticism= Tschumi's work has been criticized for sacrificing human needs for intellectual purposes. Most currently, the Greek mathematician Nikos Salingaros claims that the New Acropolis Museum clashes with the traditional architecture of Athens and continues to unnecessarily threaten historical buildings nearby. Other critics praised the Museum: \\"It is very contextual and powerfully respectful of the urban fabric of Athens while doing a dance around the ruins.\\" Comments of the AIA Honor Award Jury writing in 2011. \\"a quiet work‚Ä¶a building that is both an enlightening meditation on the Parthenon and a mesmerizing work in its own right.\\" New York Times critic Nicolai Ouroussoff \\"A geometrical marvel dedicated to the celebration of antiquity‚Ä¶a purposefully, rather than gratuitously, dynamic building.\\" Jonathan Glancey, Guardian Critic Christopher Hume wrote \\"Tschumi's building is impressive and fully engaged. It is thoroughly 21st-century, but it is not starchitecture, or anything like it. Rather, it's an elegant and thoughtful building intended to serve the collection it contains ‚Äì a model of architectural restraint, if not self- effacement.\\" Buildings Alfred Lerner Hall =Completed= * Parc de la Villette, Paris, France (1983‚Äì98) * Alfred Lerner Hall, Columbia University, New York City (1999) * New Acropolis Museum, Athens, Greece (2002‚Äì08) * FIU School of Architecture, Florida International University, Miami, Florida (2003) * Vacheron Constantin Headquarters, Geneva, Switzerland (2004) * Lindner Athletic Center, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio (2006) * Blue Condominium, 105 Norfolk Street in the Lower East Side of New York City (2007) * Limoges Concert Hall, France (2007) * Paris Zoo, France (2014) * Paul & Henri Carnal Hall, Institut Le Rosey, Rolle, Switzerland (2014) * The Hague Passage, Netherlands (2014) * Al√©sia Mus√©oParc, Dijon, France (2013) *le fresnoy contemporary art center (1997) =Proposed= * Al√©sia, Archeo Museum, Dijon, France (2018) * Elliptic City: International Financial Center of the Americas, Guayacanes, Dominican Republic (completion after 2008) Works * 1979.

It is about long; measured to its farthest source via its tributary the North Platte River, it flows for over . The Platte River is a tributary of the Missouri River, which itself is a tributary of the Mississippi River which flows to the Gulf of Mexico. The Platte over most of its length is a broad, shallow, meandering stream with a sandy bottom and many islands‚Äîa braided stream. The Platte is one of the most significant tributary systems in the watershed of the Missouri, draining a large portion of the central Great Plains in Nebraska and the eastern Rocky Mountains in Colorado and Wyoming. The river valley played an important role in the westward expansion of the United States, providing the route for several major emigrant trails, including the Oregon, California, Mormon and Bozeman trails. The first Europeans to see the Platte were French explorers and fur trappers about 1714; they first called it the Nebraskier (Nebraska), a transliteration of the name given by the Otoe people, meaning \\"flat water\\". This expression is very close to the French words \\"rivi√®re plate\\" (\\"flat river\\"), the probable origin of the name Platte River. Geography =Headwaters= The Platte River is formed in western Nebraska east of the city of North Platte, Nebraska by the confluence of the North Platte and the South Platte Rivers, which both arise from snowmelt in the eastern Rockies east of the Continental Divide. In central north Colorado is the North Park valley, ringed by mountains of 12,000 feet (3,700 m) height; this is where the North Platte River originates. The head of the North Platte River is essentially all of Jackson County; its boundaries are the continental divide on the west and south and the mountain drainage peaks on the east‚Äîthe north boundary is the state of Wyoming. The nearest Colorado town is Walden, the county seat. The rugged Rocky Mountains Continental Divide surrounding Jackson County have at least twelve peaks over 11,000 feet (3,400 m) in height. From Jackson County, the North Platte flows north about out of the Routt National Forest and North Park near what is now Walden to Casper, Wyoming. Shortly after passing Casper, the North Platte turns to the east- southeast and flows about to the city of North Platte, Nebraska. In Colorado and Wyoming, the North Platte is narrower and much swifter flowing than it is in Nebraska, where it becomes a slow flowing, shallow braided stream. Platte River watershed with tributaries The North Platte River has been dammed about eight times for water storage and irrigation purposes in Wyoming and Nebraska as it flows to its confluence with the South Platte River. The upper reaches of the river in the Rockies in Colorado and Wyoming are popular for recreation rafting and lure and fly fishing for rainbow, brown, cutthroat trout and other sport fish. In western Nebraska, the banks and riverbed of the North Platte provide a green oasis amid an otherwise semi-arid region of North America. Today, by the time the North Platte reaches Paxton, Nebraska it is much smaller due to the extensive water taken from it for irrigation. Historically, the North Platte River was up to a mile wide (1.6 km) in many places, as evinced by the old streambed and historic written records. The South Platte River drainage includes about in the north east corner of Colorado, parts of southeastern Wyoming in the vicinity of the city of Cheyenne and a small part of the southwest corner of Nebraska. The South Platte drains a large part of the Front Range mountains east of the continental divide. The part of the river labeled the South Platte is formed in Park County, Colorado, located southwest of Denver, in the South Park grassland basin and mountains east of the continental divide. It is formed by the confluence of the South Fork South Platte River and Middle Fork South Platte River, approximately southeast of Fairplay, Colorado. After the South and Middle fork join, the South Platte flows east-southeast till it exits Elevenmile Reservoir; it turns almost ninety degrees to skirt the west side of Pikes Peak and flows roughly east- northeast about through Denver and on to Greeley, Colorado. From Greeley, the South Platte turns east and flows about to its confluence with the North Platte River near the city of North Platte, Nebraska. The South Platte River has been dammed about 20 times for water storage, drinking water and irrigation purposes in Colorado as it flows to its confluence with the North Platte River. The total number of dams in the South Platte drainage may exceed 1,000 as nearly all major streams have at least one dam on them. The South Platte River serves as the principal source of water for arid eastern Colorado. The South Platte River valley provided a major emigration path to Denver. The wagon trails followed the south side of the Platte/North Platte River. Wagon trains were ferried or waded in low water years across the swampy-bottomed South Platte River in several places to stay on the south side of the North Platte River where the trails were located. Miners who later went on to Denver followed the South Platte River trail into Colorado. =Main stem= Platte River near Ft. Kearny State Historical Site in Central Nebraska After the North Platte and the South Platte rivers join to form the Platte River, over most of its length it is a sandy, broad, shallow, braided river. Its many shallow channels and islands and ever-changing sandbars made navigation difficult; it was never used as a major water transportation route. The Platte flows in a large arc, east-southeast to near Fort Kearny and then east-northeast, across Nebraska south of Grand Island and on to Columbus. The Platte River is joined from the north by the about Loup River about southeast of Columbus. During pioneer days, a Loup River ferry crossed the river. From Columbus, the Platte flows almost due east about past North Bend and then on to Fremont. Near Fremont, the Platte bends south and then east around the location of Omaha in a large \\"L\\" turn. Near Fremont the Platte turns sharply and flows south-southeast about to about Waterloo, Nebraska‚Äîlocated about west of Omaha. Near Waterloo the Platte turns even more and heads almost due south for about . About east-southeast of Waterloo and about from the Platte's confluence with the Missouri River, the Platte is joined from the north by the Elkhorn River. The Elkhorn, a river, originates in the eastern Sandhills of Nebraska and is one of the largest tributaries of the Platte River. The Elkhorn joins the Platte on its south-bound path just southwest of Omaha, approximately 1 mile (2 km) south and 3 miles (5 km) west of Gretna. The pioneers leaving from near Omaha (established 1854) or Council Bluffs, Iowa (established 1846) used the Mormon Trail north of the Platte River and had to ferry across the Elkhorn. After the Union Pacific railroad was constructed west from Omaha in 1866, it had to build a major bridge across the Elkhorn. After the confluence of the Elkhorn and the Platte River, the Platte continues southward, about before it turns sharply and heads almost due East for about before its confluence with the Missouri River. Sarpy County is shaped like a crescent, being bounded on the east by the Missouri River, on the south and west by the Platte, and on the north by Douglas County which contains Omaha. The Platte-Missouri River confluence is about south of Omaha. Platte River valley west of Omaha, Nebraska Including the North Platte River, the Platte River stretches over , with a drainage basin of about . The mean annual flow is estimated at . The Platte drains one of the most arid areas of the Great Plains with a flow that is considerably lower than rivers of comparable length in North America. For much of its length, it is a classic wide, muddy and shallow braided stream which in the lower reaches flows in a floodplain bordered by bluffs. During pioneer days, the common humorous description was that the Platte was \\"a mile wide at the mouth, but only six inches deep.\\" 49ers said it was \\"too thick to drink, too thin to plow\\". In western Nebraska, the banks and riverbed of the Platte provide a green oasis amid an otherwise semi-arid region of North America. The central Platte River valley is an important stopover for migratory water birds, such as the whooping crane and sandhill crane, in their yearly traversal of the Central Flyway. Fossil evidence in the Platte River valley indicates this crane stopover has been active for over 10 million years. Since the mid-20th century, this river has shrunk significantly. This reduction in size is attributed in part to its waters being used for irrigation, and to a much greater extent to the waters diverted and used by the growing population of Colorado, which has outstripped the ability of its groundwater to sustain them. History Encampment Along The Platte by Worthington Whittredge Varying cultures of indigenous peoples lived intermittently along the Platte for thousands of years before European exploration. Historical tribes claimed various territories in the region. The Indian tribes typically visited different areas in different seasons, as they followed the bison herds for hunting periods. The introduction of horses, which had escaped from early Spanish explorers in the 1540s, dramatically changed life in the Great Plains. Indian tribes could more easily follow the buffalo herds as they migrated from north to south and back. Before 1870, herds of several hundred thousand bison (buffalo) periodically migrated across the Platte in following seasonal grazing. The animals often waded or swam across the Platte. The first-known European to see the Platte was the French explorer √âtienne de Veniard, sieur de Bourgmont in 1714, who named it the Nebraskier, after its Oto name, meaning \\"flat water\\". The French later applied the French word plate (meaning flat, and pronounced plat, or platte) to the river. Occupied by various Indian tribes for part of each year, the Platte River territory had been claimed by both Spanish and French explorers trying to rule the Great Plains. Spain had \\"claimed\\" all of the Great Plains after Coronado's 1541‚Äì42 expedition. Jose Naranjo, an African-Hopi who served as a Spanish scout and explorer in the Southwest, was a war captain of the Spanish Indian auxiliaries. By 1714 (the same year the French explorers \\"discovered\\" the Platte), he and a small exploration group from the south had reportedly already reached the Platte three times.\\"Villasur Sent to Nebraska\\" , Nebraska Studies, accessed 24 August 2011 He later guided the 1720 Villasur expedition to the area in a Spanish effort to stop French expansion onto the Great Plains. Naranjo and Villasur's party made the most northern of Spanish exploration trips into the central plains. A Pawnee and Otoe Indian attack defeated the Spanish forces; the survivors returned to Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Spanish left the Great Plains to the American Indians. As a result of the Seven Years' War (1756‚Äì1763) (called the French and Indian War in America), the French ceded all of their lands in North America east of the Mississippi River to the British. The Spanish took over lands west of the Mississippi River. Since there were few fur-bearing animals on the Platte of interest to the fur traders, the French and British explorers and fur trappers ignored the Platte territory for some time. During the course of the Napoleonic Wars (1803‚Äì1815), France briefly reacquired the land west of the Mississippi River from Spain. In 1804, Napoleon sold the area west of the Mississippi River to the US in the Louisiana Purchase; the US roughly doubled its area at a cost of about $15,000,000. In 1820 the U.S. Army ordered Major Stephen H. Long to explore and map the area around the Platte. Long reported the area as a great American desert, despite its native inhabitants and wildlife, due to a lack of easily-cultivated land. As a result of his and other reports, the US initially had little interest in settling the land on the plains. The next \\"good\\" land was believed to be in Oregon or California, especially the coastal areas, and those were the destinations of most emigrant traffic. The Mormons settled Utah, largely due to religious persecution in eastern areas. Various gold and silver strikes attracted further emigration to nearly all western states. The Native American trail west along the Platte, North Platte River and Sweetwater River was first written about after its discovery in 1811 by Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition. He was returning to the Missouri River posts from the newly established Fort Astoria on the Columbia River near the Pacific Ocean. Because few American trappers and settlers were then in the contested Oregon Territory, his trail discovery was little used and nearly forgotten. In 1823 Jedediah Smith and several trappers \\"rediscovered\\" the route. The trail along the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater rivers became a major route of fur traders to their summer Rocky Mountain Rendezvous. In 1824 fur trappers and traders directing mule trains carrying trade goods and supplies for the mountain men were some of the first European-American parties to use the trail. On their return trip, the fur traders carried out for furs destined for eastern markets. The fur trade route was used to about 1840. By about 1832, the fur traders had improved the trail along the Platte, North Platte, and Sweetwater rivers to a rough wagon trail from the Missouri River to the Green River in Wyoming, where most of the Rocky Mountain Rendezvous were held. In 1834 Benjamin Bonneville, a U.S. Army officer on leave, led an expedition to the west financed by John Jacob Astor. They took wagons along the Platte, North Platte and Sweetwater River trail to the Green River in present-day Wyoming. The notable author Washington Irving wrote an account of Bonneville's explorations in the west that made him well known in the US. Western trails in Nebraska. The Mormon Trail is in blue; the Oregon and California trails and the Pony Express route are in red; an alternate Oregon/California route in dashed red; lesser-used trails in orange. The Platte River is between the Mormon and Oregon/California trails. Fort Kearny is the black dot. Following the fur traders, the major emigration trails established along the north and south banks of the Platte and North Platte River were the Oregon (1843‚Äì1869), California (1843‚Äì1869), Mormon (1847‚Äì1869) and the Bozeman (1863‚Äì68) trails. This network of trails, sometimes called the Emigrant Trails or the Great Platte River Road, all went west along both sides of the Platte River. The route along the Platte River included all these emigration trails and was developed as an important trail route used by migrant wagon trains for westward United States expansion after 1841. The settlement of the Oregon boundary dispute with Britain in 1846, the conclusion of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War in 1848, and the California Gold Rush in 1849 and other gold and silver strikes rapidly attracted increased emigrant traffic west. The Platte River in the future state of Nebraska and the North Platte River in Wyoming typically had many channels and islands. The waterways were often too shallow, crooked, muddy and unpredictable for a canoe to travel far. The Platte River valley provided an easily passable wagon corridor; it sloped gradually up in height as it went almost due west from the Missouri. The Platte route had access to water, grass, buffalo and buffalo 'chips,' which the Indians and emigrants used as fuel for fires.Mattes, Merrill J.' \\"The Great Platte River Road\\"; Bison Books; 1987; Long Native American use had created trails on both sides of the muddy, about wide and shallow Platte River. The Platte's water was silty and bad tasting, but it was usable if no other water was available. Emigrants learned to let it sit in a bucket for an hour or so to settle most of the silt. The trail(s) through the Platte River Valley extended about in the present state of Nebraska. Nearly all the trails from the Missouri converged on the Platte River at or before Fort Kearny in mid-state Nebraska. Historians have estimated about 400,000 emigrants followed the trails along the Platte. The Pony Express, operational from 1860‚Äì61, and the First Transcontinental Telegraph, completed in 1861, both followed the earlier emigrant trails along the Platte. The completion of the telegraph put the Pony Express out of business as it could provide much faster east‚Äìwest communication. In 1866 the Union Pacific portion of the first Transcontinental Railroad was constructed along the Platte River as it started west from Omaha. In the 20th century, the Lincoln Highway and later Interstate 80 were constructed through the Platte valley. The highways parallel the Platte and the North Platte through much of Nebraska. Many of Nebraska‚Äôs larger cities originated on or near the Platte River, as it was the first path of transportation. These include Omaha (est. 1854), Fort Kearny (est. 1848), Grand Island (est. 1857) and North Platte (est. 1869). In 1859 settlers built the first irrigation ditch to divert water from the Platte for farming. Ecosystem Every year hundreds of thousands of sandhill cranes congregate on the Platte River during their spring migration, forming large flocks that use the sandbars of the Platte River as a nighttime refuge before dispersing to local fields to feed during the day. The Platte is in the middle of the Central Flyway, a primary north‚Äìsouth corridor for migratory birds from their summer nesting grounds in the north (Alaska and Canada), south for the winter, and the return in the spring. The Central Flyway bird species include trumpeter swans, tundra swans, over one million Canada geese, greater white- fronted geese, sandhill cranes, canvasback ducks and others. Other species such as bald eagles, herons and several species of ducks migrate through the Platte River area but over shorter distances. The whooping crane, piping plover, and the interior least tern are birds using the flyway which have been classified as endangered and are protected under the Platte River Endangered Species Partnership. Common plants in the Platte River area are big and little bluestem, switch grass, and cottonwood trees. White-tail deer, many types of catfish, Canada geese, and bald eagles attract fans. The Platte River area has long supported many animals but recently, due to urbanization and farming causing loss of habitat, the numbers have declined. Canada geese have adapted to the farm fields and scavenge a large part of their fare from unharvested grain. Many have taken up residence at suburban office parks and stopped seasonal migrations. Management and policy A great blue heron and immature bald eagle on the Platte River in Nebraska The Platte River flowing through an arid part of the mid-west has been widely overused. The claims on the Platte River water have exceeded the supply of water in drier years. The criteria for water over-appropriation, according to the final reading of LB 962, is that if the river basin, sub basin, or reach is subject to an interstate cooperative agreement among three or more states and if, prior to such date, the department has declared a moratorium on the issuance of new surface water appropriations in such river basin, sub basin or reach and has requested each natural resource district with jurisdiction in the affected area in such river basin, sub basin or reach either to close or to continue in effect a previously adopted closure of all or part of such river basin, sub basin, or reach to the issuance of additional water well permits in accordance with subdivision. Most of the Platte River basin is currently considered as overappropriated. Beginning in 2004, a number of Nebraska stakeholders embarked upon the Platte River Cooperative Hydrology Study (COHYST). Conducted with assistance from the United States Geological Survey and the Natural Resources Conservation Service, this study attempts to arrive at a better understanding of the geology and hydrology of the Platte River basin from the Colorado and Wyoming borders to Columbus, including the Loup basin. This improved understanding could be used to develop policies for management of the river system, both for human use and for the sake of the basin's endangered species. As of October 2009, the study is still ongoing. See also *List of Nebraska rivers *Morning Star Lake (Nebraska) *Platte River State Park References =Further reading= *Alexander, J.S., D.M.

It is the fourth most populous city in Kazakhstan, behind Almaty (Alma-Ata), Nur-Sultan and Shymkent. Population: 497,777 (2020 Estimate); Karaganda is approximately 230 km south-east of Kazakhstan's capital Nur-Sultan (formerly known as Astana). In the 1940s up to 70% of the city's inhabitants were ethnic Germans. Most of the ethnic Germans were Soviet Volga Germans who were collectively deported to Siberia and Kazakhstan on Stalin's order when Hitler invaded Soviet-annexed eastern Poland and the Soviet Union proper in 1941. Until the 1950s, many of these deportees were interned in labor camps, often simply because they were of German descent. The population of Karaganda fell by 14% from 1989-1999 following the dissolution of the Soviet Union; it was once Kazakhstan's second-largest city after Almaty. Over 100,000 people have since emigrated to Germany. There is also a concentration of ethnic Poles in the city.  Etymology  The name \\"Karaganda\\" is derived from \\"caragana\\" bushes (Caragana arborescens, Caragana frutex), which are abundant in the area.  History  = Old Town = Modern-day Karaganda dates back to 1833, when local shepherd allegedly found coal on the site of the city, prompting a coal mining boom. By the late 19th century, the local mines had attracted workers from nearby villages, Russian merchants, and entrepreneurs from France and England. After this initial boom, the mines were abandoned, but is often still labeled on city maps as the \\"Old Town\\", but almost nothing remains on that site. = 20th century =  Re- settlement  Coal mining in the area resumed in 1930, and temporary structures were built for miners and their families. The new area for the city was to the south of the initial mines. In 1931, Karaganda was incorporated as a village, and in 1934, was declared a city. Lead by planner Alexander Ivanovich Kuznetsov, masters plans for Karaganda were laid out from 1934 until 1938. During the late 1930s, the Karlag Prison was built. During the Stalinist purges, peoples from many different nationalities, including Germans, Karachais, Kalmyks, Chechens, Ingush, Greeks, and Crimean Tatars were sent to Karlag.  EMP incident  Nurken Abdirov Street at the corner of Gogol Street. Karaganda suffered the most severe electromagnetic pulse effects ever observed when its electrical power plant was set on fire by currents induced in a long shallow buried power cable by Soviet Test ‚Äò184‚Äô on 22 October 1962. The test was part of the Soviet Project K nuclear tests (ABM System A proof tests), and consisted of a 300-kiloton high-altitude nuclear explosion at an altitude of over Zhezkazgan. Prompt gamma ray-produced EMP induced a current of 2,500 amps measured by spark gaps in a stretch of overhead telephone line to Zharyq, blowing all the protective fuses. The late-time MHD-EMP was of low enough frequency to enable it to penetrate into the ground, overloading a shallow buried lead and steel tape-protected long power cable between Aqmola (now called Nur-Sultan) and Almaty. It fired circuit breakers and set the Karaganda power plant on fire.  Late 20th century  Kuznetsov's master plan for the city was intended to accommodate 300,000 inhabitants, which was surpassed by the late 1960s. This prompted planners to devise a new plan with the goal of accommodating 600,000 people. By the 1980s, the city's population surpassed 600,000 people, creating the need for further expansion. In 1983, the Karaganda Circus was constructed, which was criticized for its high cost. In the early 1990s, Karaganda was briefly considered as a candidate for the capital of the (then) newly independent Republic of Kazakhstan, but its bid was turned down in favour of Astana. = Archaeological findings = In July 2019, remains of a young couple buried face to face dated 4,000 years back were unearthed in Karaganda region in central Kazakhstan by a group of archaeologists led by Igor Kukushkin from Saryarka Archaeological Institute in Karaganda. It is assumed that the Bronze Age couple were 16 or 17 years old when they died. Kukushkin supposes that they were from a 'noble family' thanks to the buried gold and jewelry artifacts, ceramic pots, woman's two bracelets on each arm beads, remains of horses and knives found in the grave.  Geography  = Climate = Karaganda has a humid continental climate (K√∂ppen climate classification Dfb) with warm summers and very cold winters. Precipitation is moderately low throughout the year, although slightly heavier from May to July. Snow is frequent, though light, in winter. The lowest temperature on record is , recorded in 1938, and the highest temperature is , recorded in 2002.  Industry  Karaganda is an industrial city, built to exploit nearby coal mines using the slave work of prisoners of labour camps. Flora Leipman, a British citizen, spent several years unlawfully detained in a number of other nearby camps, and described her experiences in the book \\"The Long Journey Home\\" (published 1987). Commercial extraction of coal continues to be an important activity in the region even today. Since local water resources are not sufficient for the needs of a major industrial city, the Irtysh‚ÄìKaraganda Canal was constructed in the 1960s, to supply the Karaganda metropolitan area with water from the Irtysh River more than 400 km away.  Culture  = Religion = Russian Orthodox Church in Karaganda The city is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Karaganda. = Theater = The Miners Palace of Culture is a major landmark in Karaganda. = Sports = FC Shakhter Karagandy players FC Shakhter Karagandy is a football club based in Shakhtyor Stadium. They are the current champions of the Kazakhstan Premier League. The local football club has its own heroes and big accomplishments. The most popular player in the team is Andrey Finonchenko. The biggest accomplishment is a victory against Celtic from Scotland. The score was 2‚Äì0. The city participated in the open Kazakh Cup in bandy 2009. Saryarka Karagandy is an ice hockey team that plays in the Russian-based Supreme Hockey League (VHL) The popularity of winter sports is growing each year and multi-sports winter games are organised for the Qaraghandy Region.Winter Sports Tournaments begin in Karaganda = Other = * Qaraghandy Zoo = Education = * Karaganda State Tehnical University * Karaganda State University * Karaganda State Medical University = Other = Karaganda was often used as the punchline in a popular joke in the former Soviet Union. Karaganda is fairly isolated in a vast area of uninhabited steppe, and is thought by many to be \\"the middle of nowhere\\". When used in the locative case (–ö–∞—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥–µ), the final syllable rhymes with the Russian word for \\"where\\" (–≥–¥–µ), as well as with a Russian obscenity used to answer to an unwanted question \\"Where?\\". Thus the exchange: \\"–ì–¥–µ?\\" ‚Äî \\"–í –ö–∞—Ä–∞–≥–∞–Ω–¥–µ!\\" (\\"Where is it?\\" ‚Äî \\"In Karaganda!\\")  Transport  Sary-Arka Airport is 20 kilometers south-east of the city. The city is also served by trains with all of them stopping at Karaganda railway station.

Ptolemy also mentions the Illyrian tribe named Albanoi, who lived around this city.William Smith, LLD, Ed., Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography, 1854. Ptolemy is the earliest writer in whose works the name of the Albanians has been distinctly recognised. He mentions (3.13.23) a tribe called ALBANI (·ºàŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩŒøŒØ) and a town ALBANOPOLIS (·ºàŒªŒ≤Œ±ŒΩœåœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ), in the region lying to the E. of the Ionian sea; and from the names of places with which Albanopolis is connected, it appears clearly to have been in the S. part of the Illyrian territory, and in modern Albania. There is no means of forming a conjecture on how the name of this obscure tribe came to be extended to so considerable a nation. The area was part of Roman Macedon, specifically the Epirus Nova subdivision.

Germany proceeds to invade Greece. The Battle of Greece ends with an Axis victory, with Crete holding out until June. The Axis occupation of Greece effectively partitions the country between Germany, Italy and Bulgaria. The Italians occupied the bulk of the Greek mainland and most of the islands. The Italians orchestrate the annexation of areas of Greek Epirus by Albania, citing the presence of a significant Albanian minority (the Cham Albanians). This plan is vetoed by Germany.Fischer (1999), pp. 70-75, 85 October Josip Broz Tito, Yugoslav communist leader, directs organizing of Albanian communists.

In the speech, Khrushchev criticized actions taken by the regime of Joseph Stalin, particularly the purges of the military and the upper Party echelons, and the development of Stalin's personality cult, while maintaining support for the ideals of Communism by invoking Vladimir Lenin. He also introduced the concept of peaceful coexistence between Communist and Capitalist states. Enver Hoxha adopts an Anti-Revisionism stance, condemning these ideological moves; close relations with Soviet Union become strained. 1959 Large amounts of economic aid from Soviet Union, East European countries, and China begin pouring into Albania. May Khrushchev visits Albania. 1960 June Albania sides with China in the Sino-Soviet split; consequently Soviet economic support to Albania is curtailed and Chinese aid is increased.

April 3 Alia resigns as president and is succeeded on April 9 by Sali Berisha, the first democratic leader of Albania since Bishop Noli. The first non-Communist government, headed by Aleksander Meksi, is elected on April 13. Its stated priority is to establish law and order to transform the paralyzed economy through a reform program emphasizing a free-market economy and privatization. April 16 Eduard Selami is elected chairman of the Democratic Party. June Albania signs the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Pact with ten other countries, including six former Soviet republics. The Pact establishes the Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation. Mid-July The Albanian Communist Party is outlawed, and its chairman, Hysni Milloshi, is arrested in Tirana and charged with illegally carrying a gun. July 26 Four months after its March defeat, the Socialist Party makes impressive gains in the country's first democratic local elections. The Democratic Party wins 43.2% of the vote, compared to 41.3% cast for the Socialists. Continued economic hardships, general apathy, and a split within the Democratic Party contributed to its poor showing. It holds local administrative control in most large cities, while the Socialists control much of the countryside. Mid- September Former President Alia is detained, joining eighteen other former communist officials, including Nexhmije Hoxha, who are charged with corruption and other offenses.

It is structurally related to the saturated arachidic acid found in cupua√ßu butter. Its name derives from the New Latin word arachis (peanut), but it is important to note that peanut oil does not contain any arachidonic acid. Chemistry 300px In chemical structure, arachidonic acid is a carboxylic acid with a 20-carbon chain and four cis- double bonds; the first double bond is located at the sixth carbon from the omega end. Some chemistry sources define 'arachidonic acid' to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine, and nutrition limit the term to all cis-5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid. Biology Arachidonic acid is a polyunsaturated fatty acid present in the phospholipids (especially phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine, and phosphatidylinositides) of membranes of the body's cells, and is abundant in the brain, muscles, and liver. Skeletal muscle is an especially active site of arachidonic acid retention, accounting for roughly 10-20% of the phospholipid fatty acid content typically. In addition to being involved in cellular signaling as a lipid second messenger involved in the regulation of signaling enzymes, such as PLC-Œ≥, PLC-Œ¥, and PKC-Œ±, -Œ≤, and -Œ≥ isoforms, arachidonic acid is a key inflammatory intermediate and can also act as a vasodilator. (Note separate synthetic pathways, as described in section below.) Conditionally essential fatty acid Arachidonic acid in the human body usually comes from dietary animal sources (meat, eggs) or is synthesized from linoleic acid. Arachidonic acid is not one of the essential fatty acids. However, it does become essential if a deficiency in linoleic acid exists or if an inability to convert linoleic acid to arachidonic acid occurs. Some mammals lack the ability or have a very limited capacity to convert linoleic acid to arachidonic acid, making it an essential part of their diets. The extent to which humans in fact convert linoleic acid to arachidonic acid is uncertain. Since little or no arachidonic acid is found in common plants, such animals are obligate carnivores; the cat is a common example of having the inability to desaturate essential fatty acids. A commercial source of arachidonic acid has been derived, however, from the fungus Mortierella alpina.Production of life'sARA‚Ñ¢, www.lifesdha.com/ Synthesis and cascade in humans Eicosanoid synthesis. Arachidonic acid is freed from a phospholipid molecule by the enzyme phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which cleaves off the fatty acid, but can also be generated from DAG by diacylglycerol lipase. Arachidonic acid generated for signaling purposes appears to be derived by the action of group IVA cytosolic phospholipase A2 (cPLA2, 85 kDa), whereas inflammatory arachidonic acid is generated by the action of a low-molecular-weight secretory PLA2 (sPLA2, 14-18 kDa). Arachidonic acid is the precursor that is metabolized by various enzymes to a wide range of biologically and clinically important eicosanoids and metabolites of these eicosanoids: * The enzymes cyclooxygenase-1 and -2 (i.e. prostaglandin G/H synthase 1 and 2 {PTGS1 and PTGS2}) metabolize arachidonic acid to prostaglandin G2 and prostaglandin H2, which in turn may be converted to various prostaglandins, to prostacyclin, to thromboxanes, and to the 17-carbon product of thromboxane metabolism of prostaglandin G2/H2, 12-Hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid (12-HHT). * The enzyme 5-lipoxygenase metabolizes arachidonic acid to 5-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HPETE), which in turn is metabolized to various leukotrienes (i.e. leukotriene B4, leukotriene C4, leukotriene D4, and leukotriene E4 as well as to 5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (5-HETE) which may then be further metabolized to 5-HETE's more potent 5-keto analog, 5-oxo-eicosatetraenoic acid (5-oxo-ETE) (also see 5-Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid. * The enzymes 15-lipoxygenase-1 (ALOX15 and 15-lipoxygenase-2 (ALOX15B metabolize arachidonic acid to 15-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HPETE) which may then be further metabolized to 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE) and lipoxins; 15-Lipoxygenase-1 may also further metabolize 15-HPETE to eoxins in a pathway analogous to (and presumably using the same enzymes as used in) the pathway which metabolizes 5-HPETE to leukotrienes. * The enzyme 12-lipoxygenase (ALOX12) metabolizes arachidonic acid to 12-hydroperoxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HPETE) which may then be metabolized to 12-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12-HETE) and to hepoxilins. * Arachidonic acid is also used in the biosynthesis of anandamide. * Some arachidonic acid is converted into hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids (HETEs) and epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) by epoxygenase. The production of these derivatives and their actions in the body are collectively known as the \\"arachidonic acid cascade\\"; see essential fatty acid interactions and the enzyme and metabolite linkages given in the previous paragraph for more details. =PLA2 activation= PLA2, in turn, is activated by ligand binding to receptors, including: * 5-HT2 receptors * mGLUR1 * bFGF receptor * IFN-Œ± receptor * IFN-Œ≥ receptor Furthermore, any agent increasing intracellular calcium may cause activation of some forms of PLA2. =PLC activation= Alternatively, arachidonic acid may be cleaved from phospholipids after phospholipase C (PLC) cleaves off the inositol trisphosphate group, yielding diacylglycerol (DAG), which subsequently is cleaved by DAG lipase to yield arachidonic acid. Receptors that activate this pathway include: * A1 receptor * D2 receptor * Œ±-2 adrenergic receptor * 5-HT1 receptor PLC may also be activated by MAP kinase. Activators of this pathway include PDGF and FGF. In the body =Muscle growth= Arachidonic acid promotes the repair and growth of skeletal muscle tissue via conversion to prostaglandin PGF2alpha during and following physical exercise. PGF2alpha promotes muscle protein synthesis by signaling through the Akt/mTOR pathway, similar to leucine, Œ≤-hydroxy Œ≤-methylbutyric acid, and phosphatidic acid. =Brain= Arachidonic acid is one of the most abundant fatty acids in the brain, and is present in similar quantities to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The two account for about 20% of its fatty-acid content. Like DHA, neurological health is reliant upon sufficient levels of arachidonic acid. Among other things, arachidonic acid helps to maintain hippocampal cell membrane fluidity. It also helps protect the brain from oxidative stress by activating peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma. ARA also activates syntaxin-3 (STX-3), a protein involved in the growth and repair of neurons. Arachidonic acid is also involved in early neurological development. In one study, infants (18 months) given supplemental arachidonic acid for 17 weeks demonstrated significant improvements in intelligence, as measured by the Mental Development Index. This effect is further enhanced by the simultaneous supplementation of ARA with DHA. In adults, the disturbed metabolism of ARA may contribute to neuropsychiatric disorders such as Alzheimer's disease and bipolar disorder. There is evidence of significant alterations in the conversion of arachidonic acid to other bioactive molecules (overexpression or disturbances in the ARA enzyme cascade) in these conditions. =Alzheimer's disease= Studies on arachidonic acid and the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's disease have shown mixed results, with one study of AA and its metabolites that suggests they are associated with the onset of Alzheimer's disease, whereas another study suggests that the supplementation of arachidonic acid during the early stages of this disease may be effective in reducing symptoms and slowing the disease progress. Additional studies on arachidonic acid supplementation for Alzheimer's patients are needed. Another study indicates that air pollution is the source of inflammation and arachidonic acid metabolites promote the inflammation to signal the immune system of the cell damage. =Bodybuilding supplement= Arachidonic acid is marketed as an anabolic bodybuilding supplement in a variety of products. Supplementation of arachidonic acid (1,500 mg/day for 8 weeks) has been shown to increase lean body mass, strength, and anaerobic power in experienced resistance-trained men. This was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled study at the University of Tampa. Thirty men (aged 20.4 ¬± 2.1 years) took arachidonic acid or a placebo for 8 weeks, and participated in a controlled resistance- training program. After 8 weeks, lean body mass (LBM) had increased significantly, and to a greater extent, in the ARA group (1.62 kg) vs. placebo (0.09 kg) (p<0.05). The change in muscle thickness was also greater in the ARA group (.47 cm) than placebo (.25 cm) (p<0.05). Wingate anaerobic power increased to a greater extent in ARA group as well (723.01 to 800.66 W) vs. placebo (738.75 to 766.51 W). Lastly, the change in total strength was significantly greater in the ARA group (109.92 lbs.) compared to placebo (75.78 lbs.). These results suggest that ARA supplementation can positively augment adaptations in strength and skeletal muscle hypertrophy in resistance- trained men. An earlier clinical study examining the effects of 1,000 mg/day of arachidonic acid for 50 days found supplementation to enhance anaerobic capacity and performance in exercising men. During this study, a significant group‚Äìtime interaction effect was observed in Wingate relative peak power (AA: 1.2 ¬± 0.5; P: -0.2 ¬± 0.2 W‚Ä¢kg-1, p=0.015). Statistical trends were also seen in bench press 1RM (AA: 11.0 ¬± 6.2; P: 8.0 ¬± 8.0 kg, p=0.20), Wingate average power (AA:37.9 ¬± 10.0; P: 17.0 ¬± 24.0 W, p=0.16), and Wingate total work (AA: 1292 ¬± 1206; P: 510 ¬± 1249 J, p=0.087). AA supplementation during resistance training promoted significant increases in relative peak power with other performance-related variables approaching significance. These findings support the use of AA as an ergogenic. Dietary arachidonic acid and inflammation Increased consumption of arachidonic acid will not cause inflammation during normal metabolic conditions unless lipid peroxidation products are mixed in. Arachidonic acid is metabolized to both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids during and after the inflammatory response, respectively. Arachidonic acid is also metabolized to inflammatory and anti-inflammatory eicosanoids during and after physical activity to promote growth. However, chronic inflammation from exogenous toxins and excessive exercise should not be confused with acute inflammation from exercise and sufficient rest that is required by the inflammatory response to promote the repair and growth of the micro tears of tissues. However, the evidence is mixed. Some studies giving between 840 mg and 2,000 mg per day to healthy individuals for up to 50 days have shown no increases in inflammation or related metabolic activities.Changes in whole blood and clinical safety markers over 50 days of concomitant arachidonic acid supplementation and resistance training . Wilborn, C, M Roberts, C Kerksick, M Iosia, L Taylor, B Campbell, T Harvey, R Wilson, M. Greenwood, D Willoughby and R Kreider. Proceedings of the International Society of Sports Nutrition (ISSN) Conference June 15‚Äì17, 2006. However, others show that increased arachidonic acid levels are actually associated with reduced pro-inflammatory IL-6 and IL-1 levels and increased anti-inflammatory tumor necrosis factor-beta. This may result in a reduction in systemic inflammation. Arachidonic acid does still play a central role in inflammation related to injury and many diseased states. How it is metabolized in the body dictates its inflammatory or anti-inflammatory activity. Individuals suffering from joint pains or active inflammatory disease may find that increased arachidonic acid consumption exacerbates symptoms, presumably because it is being more readily converted to inflammatory compounds. Likewise, high arachidonic acid consumption is not advised for individuals with a history of inflammatory disease, or who are in compromised health. Of note, while ARA supplementation does not appear to have proinflammatory effects in healthy individuals, it may counter the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3 fatty acid supplementation. Health effects of arachidonic acid supplementation Arachidonic acid supplementation in daily doses of 1,000‚Äì1,500 mg for 50 days has been well tolerated during several clinical studies, with no significant side effects reported. All common markers of health, including kidney and liver function, serum lipids, immunity, and platelet aggregation appear to be unaffected with this level and duration of use. Furthermore, higher concentrations of ARA in muscle tissue may be correlated with improved insulin sensitivity. Arachidonic acid supplementation of the diets of healthy adults appears to offer no toxicity or significant safety risk. While studies looking at arachidonic acid supplementation in sedentary subjects have failed to find changes in resting inflammatory markers in doses up to 1,500 mg daily, strength-trained subjects may respond differently. One study reported a significant reduction in resting inflammation (via marker IL-6) in young men supplementing 1,000 mg/day of arachidonic acid for 50 days in combination with resistance training. This suggests that rather being pro-inflammatory, supplementation of ARA while undergoing resistance training may actually improve the regulation of systemic inflammation. A meta-analysis looking for associations between heart disease risk and individual fatty acids reported a significantly reduced risk of heart disease with higher levels of EPA and DHA (omega-3 fats), as well as the omega-6 arachidonic acid. A scientific advisory from the American Heart Association has also favorably evaluated the health impact of dietary omega-6 fats, including arachidonic acid. The group does not recommend limiting this essential fatty acid. In fact, the paper recommends individuals follow a diet that consists of at least 5‚Äì10% of calories coming from omega-6 fats, including arachidonic acid. It suggests dietary ARA is not a risk factor for heart disease, and may play a role in maintaining optimal metabolism and reduced heart disease risk. Maintaining sufficient intake levels of both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, therefore, is recommended for optimal health. Arachidonic acid is not carcinogenic, and studies show dietary level is not associated (positively or negatively) with risk of cancers. ARA remains integral to the inflammatory and cell growth process, however, which is disturbed in many types of disease including cancer. Therefore, the safety of arachidonic acid supplementation in patients suffering from cancer, inflammatory, or other diseased states is unknown, and supplementation is not recommended.

He was also the country's head of state from 1982 to 1992. He had been designated as successor by Enver Hoxha and took power after Hoxha died. Alia died on 7 October 2011 in Tirana due to lung disease, aged 85.Albania's last Communist leader Ramiz Alia dies, CNBC, 7 October 2011. Early life and politics Alia was born on 18 October 1925 in Shkoder to Muslim parents who fled from persecution in Kingdom of Yugoslavia. He grew up and spent his childhood in Tirana. In the early part of World War II Alia was a member of a Fascist youth organization known as the 'Fascist Lictor Youth Organization' but joined the underground Albanian Communist Youth Organization in 1941.J.F. Brown: Background Notes to Albania's Party Congress ‚Äì Special Report , Open Society Archives, 2 February 1961. In 1943, he became a member of the Albanian Communist Party. He had risen rapidly under Hoxha's patronage and by 1961 was a full member of the ruling Political Bureau (Politburo of the Party of Labour of Albania).Eastern Christianity and the Cold War, 1945-91, p.154 Hoxha chose Alia for several reasons. First, Alia had long been a militant follower of Marxism-Leninism and supported Hoxha's policy of national self-reliance. Alia also was favored by Hoxha's wife Nexhmije, who had once been his instructor at the Institute of Marxism- Leninism. His political experience was similar to that of Hoxha; and inasmuch as he appeared to share Hoxha's views on most foreign and domestic issues, he accommodated himself to the totalitarian mode of ruling. Political career =First Secretary of the Albanian Labour Party= After World War II, Alia resumed his duties in the Communist Youth Organization, and at the First Congress of the Albanian Party of Labour in November 1948, he was elected to its Central Committee and was assigned to the department of agitation and propaganda. When he succeeded Hoxha in 1985, the country was in grave difficulty. Political apathy and cynicism were pervasive, with large segments of the population having rejected the government's values. The economy, which suffered from low productivity and permanent shortages of the most basic foodstuffs, showed no sign of improvement. Social controls and self-discipline had eroded. The intelligentsia was beginning to resist strict party controls and to criticize the government's failure to observe international standards of human rights. Apparently recognizing the depth and extent of the societal malaise, Alia cautiously and slowly began to make changes in the system. His first target was the economic system. In an effort to improve economic efficiency, Alia introduced some economic decentralization and price reform in specific sectors. Alia did not relax censorship, but he did allow public discussions of Albania's societal problems and encouraged debates among writers and artists on cultural issues. In response to international criticism of Albania's record on human rights, the new leadership loosened some political controls and ceased to apply repression on a mass scale. In 1989, general amnesties brought about the release of many long-term prisoners. He strengthened ties with Greece, Italy, Turkey, and Yugoslavia. A loosening of restrictions on travel and tourism resulted in a more promising outlook for Albania's tourist trade. =Transition to multi-party system and presidency= Despite Alia's efforts to proceed with change on a limited, cautious basis, reform from above threatened to turn into reform from below, largely because of the increasingly vocal demands of Albania's youth. On 9 December 1990, student demonstrators marched from the Enver Hoxha University (now University of Tirana) at Tirana through the streets of the capital shouting slogans and demanding reforms. By 11 December, the number of participants had reached almost 3,000. In an effort to quell the student unrest, which had led to clashes with riot police, Alia met with the students and agreed to take further steps toward democratization. The students informed Alia that they wanted to create an independent political organization of students and youth. Alia's response was that such an organization had to be registered with the Ministry of Justice. In his traditional New Year's message to the Albanian people, Alia welcomed the changes that had been occurring in the country and claimed that 1991 would be a turning point in terms of the economy. Despite positive signs of change, many Albanians were still trying to leave their country. At the end of 1990, as many as 5,000 Albanians crossed over the mountainous border into Greece. Young people motivated by economic dissatisfaction made up the bulk of the refugees. Alia was a crucial figure in the peaceful political transition of the early 1990s as many believe that he helped the rise to power of the anti-communist opposition forces thus eliminating possible bloodshed. Alia managed to remain a key political figure throughout several political crises. Nonetheless, with Albania in the throes of a grave economic crisis, Alia had to face challenges that he could not surmount. After the collapse of a coalition government in December 1991 and the Democratic Party of Albania's (DPA) landslide victory in the spring 1992 general election, he resigned as president on 3 April 1992. On 9 April the People's Assembly elected DPA leader Sali Berisha as Albania's new head of state. Arrest On 21 May 1994, senior officials from the Communist government, including Ramiz Alia, went on trial. Alia was charged with abuse of power and misappropriation of state funds, as was prime minister Adil Car√ßani, deputy prime minister Manush Myftiu, and Rita Marko who was a vice- president. Alia had been placed under house arrest in August 1992 and his detention was converted into imprisonment in August 1993. In court he claimed he was the victim of a political show trial and demanded that the trial be broadcast on television, a request denied by the presiding judge. The trial was monitored by a Human Rights Watch representative and proceeded with only minor due process irregularities. The ten defendants were found guilty as charged and sentenced to between three and nine years in prison; Alia received a nine-year sentence. A court of appeals subsequently reduced some of the sentences, notably Alia's to five years. Alia, Myftiu, Car√ßani, Stefani and Isai were also ordered to repay various sums to the state. On 30 November, the Court of Cassation reduced Alia's term by an additional three years. On 7 July 1995, Ramiz Alia was freed from jail. However, his freedom was short-lived and in 1996 he was charged with committing crimes against humanity during his term, and was imprisoned anew in March. The trial against him began on 18 February 1997, but he escaped from the prison following the unrest in the country and the desertion of the guards. Amid the unrest he appeared on State TV in an exclusive interview with Blendi Fevziu. In the late 2000s he was sometimes seen travelling to Albania from Dubai to give interviews or publicize his books.\\"Ish-presidenti i Shqip√´ris√´, Ramiz Alia boton librin \\"Jeta Ime\\"\\" Shqiperia, 4 May 2011 Death Ramiz Alia died on 7 October 2011 in Tirana from lung disease, shortly before his 87th birthday, according to a spokesman for President Bamir Topi.

Very close to her husband, she attempted to remain politically influential after his death in 1985. Biography Hoxha was born Nexhmije Xhuglini in Bitola, in present-day North Macedonia. Later moving with her parents to the Albanian capital, Tirana, she studied at the Queen Mother Pedagogical Institute. In November 1941, while still training to be a schoolteacher, she joined the newly founded Albanian Party of Labour and a year later was elected to the General Council of the Albanian National Liberation Movement. During the Second World War she fought against the forces of Fascist Italy and German Wehrmacht troops, as part of the First Division of the National Liberation Army, a resistance group dominated by Communists and supported by Special Operations Executive forces sent by the British. In 1943 she was elected to the Secretariat of the (Communist) Albanian Women's League, and served as chairwoman from 1946 to 1952, replacing Ollga Plumbi. =Relationship with Enver Hoxha= The then Nexhmije Xhuglini met Enver Hoxha at a meeting of the Albanian Party of Labour. Hoxha proposed to her in 1942 at a house rented to him by generous party supporter Syrja Selfo, who would be sentenced to death and executed after a show trial in 1946. The Hoxhas then stayed for several months on and off in the house of Enver's brother in law Bahri Omari, destined to be executed by firing squad in 1945. Enver Hoxha steadily rose to a prominent position after the end of the war and the establishment of a Communist government. Influence In 1966, as Albania increasingly isolated itself, she became director of the Institute of Marxist‚ÄìLeninist Studies, a body responsible for ensuring ideological purity and spreading propaganda. Her relation with the Sigurimi secret police is widely discussed. Nexhmije later claimed in her 1998 memoir, My Life with Enver, that her husband did express some regret for the number of executions carried out. After her husband died in 1985, Nexhmije was elected chairwoman of the Democratic Front, an umbrella association, and defended her husband's heritage during the period of reforms (1990‚Äì1991). She was forced to resign as chairwoman of the Democratic Front in December 1990, and was replaced by Prime Minister Adil √áar√ßani. Later life and death She was expelled from ALP in June 1991 and the party organ Zeri i Popullit criticised her for her allegedly pompous way of life. She was arrested on 4 December 1991 and at the end of January 1993 she was sentenced to nine years in prison for embezzlement of 750,000 leks. The sentence was increased to eleven years by the appeal court. Hoxha was released from prison in January 1997. Wojciech Roszkowski og Jan Kofman. Biographical Dictionary of Central and Eastern Europe in the Twentieth Century (p. 358). Taylor and Francis. Kindle Edition. 2015 Hoxha died on 26 February 2020 aged 99 at her home in Tirana from natural causes. At the time of her death she was the oldest living member of the communist leadership of Albania. Personal According to her former daughter in law, Lilliana, one of Nexhmije Hoxha's hobbies was viewing the video of Mehmet Shehu, once Prime Minister, being tortured before he either committed suicide or was murdered on the orders of Enver Hoxha. She lived for many years with her husband in the section of Tirana known as the Bllok, reserved for the ruling elite. Being at the apex of the party elite, they had access to foreign goods not available to ordinary Albanians and reportedly owned 25 fridges and televisions. However, Nexhmije herself maintained she did not live extravagantly and never had done, emphasizing the prosaic nature of her marriage ceremony in 1945, which did not include a dress, a reception or a honeymoon.

The text has been ascribed to different dates between the first and third centuries, but a mid- first century date is now the most commonly accepted. While the author is unknown, it is clearly a firsthand description by someone familiar with the area and is nearly unique in providing accurate insights into what the ancient Hellenic world knew about the lands around the Indian Ocean. Name A periplus (, per√≠plous, .\\"a sailing-around\\") is a kind of logbook recording sailing itineraries and commercial, political, and ethnological details about the ports visited. In an era before maps were in general use, they functioned as a kind of combination atlas and traveller's handbook. The Erythraean Sea (, Erythr√† Th√°lassa, .\\"the Red Sea\\") was an ancient geographical designation that always included the Gulf of Aden between Arabia Felix and the Horn of Africa and was often extendedas in this periplusto include the present-day Red Sea, Persian Gulf, and Indian Ocean as a single maritime area. Date and authorship The 10th-century Byzantine manuscript which forms the basis of present knowledge of the Periplus attributes the work to Arrian, but apparently for no better reason than its position beside Arrian's much later Periplus of the Black Sea. One historical analysis, published by Schoff in 1912, narrowed the date of the text to 5962, in agreement with present-day estimates of the middle of the 1st century. Schoff additionally provides an historical analysis as to the text's original authorship, and arrives at the conclusion that the author was a \\"Greek in Egypt, a Roman subject.\\" By Schoff's calculations, this would have been during the time of Tiberius Claudius Balbilus (who coincidentally also was an Egyptian Greek). John Hill maintains that \\"the Periplus can now be confidently dated to between 40 and 70 AD and, probably, between AD 40 and 50.\\" Schoff continues by noting that the author could not have been \\"a highly educated man\\" as \\"is evident from his frequent confusion of Greek and Latin words and his clumsy and sometimes ungrammatical constructions.\\" Because of \\"the absence of any account of the journey up the Nile and across the desert from Coptos,\\" Schoff prefers to pinpoint the author's residence to \\"Berenice rather than Alexandria.\\" Synopsis 1597 map depicting the locations of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea. The work consists of 66 sections, most of them about the length of a long paragraph in English. For instance, the short section 9 reads in its entirety: In many cases, the description of places is sufficiently accurate to identify their present locations; for others, there is considerable debate. For instance, a \\"Rhapta\\" is mentioned as the farthest market down the African coast of \\"Azania\\", but there are at least five locations matching the description, ranging from Tanga to south of the Rufiji River delta. The description of the Indian coast mentions the Ganges River clearly, yet after that is somewhat garbled, describing China as a \\"great inland city Thina\\" that is a source of raw silk. The Periplus says that a direct sailing route from the Red Sea to the Indian peninsula across the open ocean was discovered by Hippalus (1st century). Many trade goods are mentioned in the Periplus, but some of the words naming trade goods are seen nowhere else in ancient literature, and so we can only guess as to what they might be. For example, one trade good mentioned is \\"lakkos chromatinos\\". The name lakkos appears nowhere else in ancient Greek or Roman literature. The name re- surfaces in late medieval Latin as lacca, borrowed from medieval Arabic lakk in turn borrowed from Sanskritic lakh, meaning lac i.e. a red-colored resin native to India used as a lacquer and used also as a red colorant.Sino-Iranica by Berthold Laufer, year 1919, page 476, footnote 9. Also A Glossary of Colloquial Anglo-Indian Words and Phrases, by Yule and Burnell, year 1903, page 499. Some other named trade goods remain obscure. =Himyarite kingdom and Saba= Coin of the Himyarite Kingdom, southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, in which ships stopped when passing between Egypt and India. This is an imitation of a coin of Augustus, 1st century Ships from Himyar regularly traveled the East African coast. The Periplus of the Erythraean Sea describes the trading empire of Himyar and Saba, regrouped under a single ruler, \\"Charibael\\" (probably Karab'il Watar Yuhan'em II), who is said to have been on friendly terms with Rome: =Frankincense kingdom= The Frankincense kingdom is described further east along the southern coast of the Arabian Peninsula, with the harbour of Cana (South Arabic Qana, modern Bir Ali in Hadramaut). The ruler of this kingdom is named Eleazus, or Eleazar, thought to correspond to King Iliazz Yalit I: =Somalia= Ras Hafun in northern Somalia is believed to be the location of the ancient trade center of Opone. Ancient Egyptian, Roman and Persian Gulf pottery has been recovered from the site by an archaeological team from the University of Michigan. Opone is in the thirteenth entry of the Periplus of the Erythraean Sea, which in part states: In ancient times, Opone operated as a port of call for merchants from Phoenicia, Egypt, Greece, Persia, Yemen, Nabataea, Azania, the Roman Empire and elsewhere, as it possessed a strategic location along the coastal route from Azania to the Red Sea. Merchants from as far afield as Indonesia and Malaysia passed through Opone, trading spices, silks and other goods, before departing south for Azania or north to Yemen or Egypt on the trade routes that spanned the length of the Indian Ocean's rim. As early as 50, Opone was well known as a center for the cinnamon trade, along with the trading of cloves and other spices, ivory, exotic animal skins and incense. The ancient port city of Malao, situated in present-day Berbera in north central Somaliland, is also mentioned in the Periplus: =Aksum Empire= Coins of king Endybis, 227-235. British Museum. The left one reads in Greek \\"ŒëŒûŒ©ŒúŒôŒ§Œ© ŒíŒëœπŒôŒõŒïŒ•œπ\\", \\"King of Axum\\". The right one reads in Greek: \\"ŒïŒùŒîŒ•ŒíŒôœπ ŒíŒëœπŒôŒõŒïŒ•œπ\\", \\"King Endybis\\". Aksum is mentioned in the Periplus as an important market place for ivory, which was exported throughout the ancient world: According to the Periplus, the ruler of Aksum was Zoscales, who, besides ruling in Aksum also held under his sway two harbours on the Red Sea: Adulis (near Massawa) and Avalites (Assab). He is also said to have been familiar with Greek literature: =Rhapta= Recent research by the Tanzanian archaeologist Felix A. Chami has uncovered extensive remains of Roman trade items near the mouth of the Rufiji River and the nearby Mafia island, and makes a strong case that the ancient port of Rhapta was situated on the banks of the Rufiji River just south of Dar es Salaam. The Periplus informs us that: Chami summarizes the evidence for Rhapta's location as follows: In recent years, Felix Chami has found archaeological evidence for extensive Roman trade on Mafia Island and, not far away, on the mainland, near the mouth of the Rufiji River, which he dated to the first few centuries. Furthermore, Miller points out that Roman coins have been found on Pemba island, just north of Rhapta. Nevertheless, Carl Peters has argued that Rhapta was near modern-day Quelimane in Mozambique,Peters, C., 1902. \\"The Eldorado of the Ancients\\", pages 312‚Äì319, 347. London: Pearson and Bell citing the fact that (according to the Periplus) the coastline there ran down towards the southwest. Peters also suggests that the description of the \\"Pyralaoi\\" (i.e., the \\"Fire people\\") ‚Äì \\"situated at the entry to the [Mozambique] Channel\\" ‚Äì indicates that they were the inhabitants of the volcanic Comoro Islands. He also maintains that Menuthias (with its abundance of rivers and crocodiles) cannot have been Zanzibar; i.e., Madagascar seems more likely. The Periplus informs us that Rhapta, was under the firm control of a governor appointed by Arabian king of Musa, taxes were collected, and it was serviced by \\"merchant craft that they staff mostly with Arab skippers and agents who, through continual intercourse and intermarriage, are familiar with the area and its language\\". The Periplus explicitly states that Azania (which included Rhapta) was subject to \\"Charibael\\", the king of both the Sabaeans and Homerites in the southwest corner of Arabia. The kingdom is known to have been a Roman ally at this period. Charibael is stated in the Periplus to be \\"a friend of the (Roman) emperors, thanks to continuous embassies and gifts\\" and, therefore, Azania could fairly be described as a vassal or dependency of Rome, just as Zesan is described in the 3rd-century Chinese history, the Weil√ºe.Hill (2004), Section 15 =Bharuch= Trade with the Indian harbour of Barygaza is described extensively in the Periplus. Nahapana, ruler of the Indo-Scythian Western Satraps is mentioned under the name Nambanus,\\"History of the Andhras\\" by Durga Prasad as ruler of the area around Barigaza: Coin of Nahapana (119‚Äì124). Obv: Bust of king Nahapana with a legend in Greek script \\"Œ°ŒëŒùŒùŒôŒ© ŒûŒëŒóŒëŒ°ŒëŒ§Œëœπ ŒùŒëŒóŒëŒ†ŒëŒùŒëœπ\\", transliteration of the Prakrit Ra√±o Kshaharatasa Nahapanasa: \\"King Kshaharata Nahapana\\". Under the Western Satraps, Barigaza was one of the main centers of Roman trade in the subcontinent. The Periplus describes the many goods exchanged: Goods were also brought down in quantity from Ujjain, the capital of the Western Satraps: =Early Chera, Pandyan, and Chola kingdoms= The lost port city of Muziris (near present day Kodungallur) in the Chera kingdom, as well as the Early Pandyan Kingdom are mentioned in the Periplus as major centers of trade, pepper and other spices, metal work and semiprecious stones, between Damirica and the Roman Empire. According to the Periplus, numerous Greek seamen managed an intense trade with Muziris: Damirica or Limyrike is Tamilagam (Tamil ‡Æ§‡ÆÆ‡Æø‡Æ¥‡Æï‡ÆÆ‡Øç) ‚Äì the \\"Tamil country\\". Further, this area served as a hub for trade with the interior, in the Gangetic plain: =Indo‚ÄìChina border= The Periplus also describes the annual fair in present-day Northeast India, on the border with China. S√™satai are the source of malabathron. Schoff's translation mentions them as Besatae: they are a people similar to Kirradai and they lived in the region between \\"Assam and Sichuan\\". =Remains of the Indo-Greek kingdom= The Periplus explains that coins of the Indo-Greek king Menander I were current in Barigaza. The Periplus claims that Greek buildings and wells exist in Barigaza, falsely attributing them to Alexander the Great, who never went this far south. This account of a kingdom tracing its beginnings to Alexander's campaigns and the Hellenistic Seleucid empire that followed: The Periplus further claims to the circulation of Indo-Greek coinage in the region: The Greek city of Alexandria Bucephalous on the Jhelum River is mentioned in the Periplus, as well as in the Roman Peutinger Table:  Manuscripts  The Periplus was originally known only through a single manuscript dating from the 14th or 15th century, now held by the British Museum.BM Add 19391 9r-12r. This edition proved to be a corrupt and error-ridden copy of a 10th-century Byzantine manuscript in minuscule hand. The 10th-century manuscript placed it beside Arrian's Periplus of the Black Sea and (apparently mistakenly) also credited Arrian with writing it as well. The Byzantine manuscript was taken from Heidelberg to Rome during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648), then to Paris under Napoleon after his army's conquest of the Papal States in the late 1790s, then returned to Heidelberg's University Library in 1816 where it remains.CPG 398: 40v-54v. Editions The British manuscript was edited by Sigmund Gelen () in Prague\\"viaLibri Resources for Bibliophiles\\" and first published by Hieronymus Froben in 1533. This error-ridden text served as the basis for other editions and translations for three centuries, until the restoration of the original manuscript to Heidelberg in 1816. Schoff's heavily annotated 1912 English translation was itself based on a defective original; as late as the 1960s, the only trustworthy scholarly edition was Frisk's 1927 French study.

It was once an international airport, but is now a domestic secondary airport serving Nagoya while the current primary civil airport for Nagoya is Ch≈´bu Centrair International Airport in Tokoname. It is the main hub for FDA (Fuji Dream Airlines), the only airline that offers scheduled air service from the airfield. It is also used for general aviation and as an airbase. Mitsubishi Aircraft Corporation is headquartered in the airport's terminal building, and its parent company Mitsubishi Heavy Industries produces the Mitsubishi Regional Jet aircraft at a factory adjacent to the airport.

The four Boeing KC-767J tankers of the 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron are based there. History Nagoya Airport served as the main airport for Nagoya until the opening of Chubu Centrair International Airport on February 17, 2005. This airport IATA Airport Code used to be NGO (now overtaken by the new Centrair airport), and its ICAO Airport Code used to be RJNN when it was classified as a second class airport; the new designations are NKM for regional flights and RJNA designation for general aviation flights. Aichi Prefecture manages the facilities and regularly handles international business flights. During the 1980s and early 1990s, Nagoya Airport was a busy international airport because of overflow from Japan's other international airports, New Tokyo International Airport (now Narita International Airport) near Tokyo and Osaka International Airport (Itami Airport) near Osaka. Since the opening of Kansai International Airport in 1994, the airport's main traffic source has been the nearby automotive and manufacturing industries, causing carriers such as United Airlines (United currently serves Centrair Airport with flights to Guam) and Delta Air Lines (Portland (OR)) to stop flying to Nagoya (Delta currently serves Centrair Airport with flights to Detroit, Guam, Saipan, and Honolulu). Some discount holiday flights still operated from Nagoya, drawing passengers from the Kansai region. On the other hand, the cargo handling capacity of Nagoya Airport was not enough to satisfy the demands from the regional economy and air cargo shifted to Narita and Kansai. In addition, the airport was hampered by its location in a residential area of Aichi Prefecture, limiting the number of flights that can use the airport, as well as the hours in which they can fly. Because of these reasons, a new airport, Chubu Centrair International Airport, was built on an island south of Nagoya. On February 17, 2005, nearly all of Nagoya Airport's commercial transport flights moved to Centrair. On the same day, the old airport became a general aviation and airbase facility, as well as was renamed to the current names. It also became J-AIR's headquarters after a hub relocation from Hiroshima-Nishi Airport. The airline continued to operate through the airport until Fuji Dream Airlines opened a base at the airport and a corporate restructuring of its parent company Japan Airlines in 2010 resulted in J-Air's departure from the airport and moving of its operation base to Itami Airport in Osaka. A dedicated business aviation terminal and commuter flights within Japan then became the key features of Nagoya's secondary airport. The Aichi Museum of Flight opened at the airport in November 2017. =Military use= Imperial Period Nagoya Airport was first opened in 1944 as a military airport named Kamake Airfield. It was primarily used as the home base of the 55th Sentai of the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service. As such, it was attacked on several occasions during the Pacific War in 1944 and 1945 by USAAF B-29 Superfortress bombing raids. U.S. period After the end of World War II, the airfield was taken over by the American occupation forces and renamed Nagoya Air Base. Reconstruction of the heavily damaged airfield began and in May 1946, Nagoya became the Headquarters of the Fifth Air Force, which controlled Air Force occupation units throughout Japan. In December 1950 during the Korean War, Fifth Air Force headquarters was moved to South Korea; however, it returned to Nagoya Air Base in September 1954 and remained until July 1957 when it moved to Fuchu Air Station in Tokyo as part of the USAF return of Nagoya Airport to Japanese control. The U.S. primarily used Nagoya Air Base as a headquarters station for the next ten years, stationing several command and control units at the base: * 308th Bombardment Wing, 1 Mar 1947-30 Jun 1948 : Moved to Nagoya in March from Kimpo Air Base, South Korea where it had been performing occupation duty since moving there from Okinawa in September 1945 * 85th Fighter Wing, 1 Jun 1947-30 Jun 1948 : Moved from the Philippines to set up an air defense organization in Japan. * 314th Air Division, 1 Dec 1950-1 Mar 1952 : Activated at Nagoya. During the Korean War it assumed the missions of airfield construction and defense of Japan as well as providing logistical support for the Fifth Air Force. Operational use from the airfield began in February 1947 when the 347th Fighter Group (All Weather) began operating P-61 Black Widow interceptor aircraft, which were used to provide air defense for Japan. It operated from the airfield until June 1950 when the Black Widows were retired and the unit was inactivated. After the Armistice in South Korea which ended combat, the 49th Fighter Group moved to Nagoya Air Base with F-84 Thunderjets. The unit provided air defense until June 1957 when it moved to Misawa Air Base. The 6110th Air Base Group, which had maintained the base and the myriad of ground support units at the base since the Americans moved in during 1946 began phasing down after July 1957. The 6110th USAF Hospital remained open until 30 June 1958 when the last Americans left Nagoya Airfield and it was returned to Japanese control. Japan Self-Defense Force In 2009 the first dedicated air-to-air refueling squadron of the Japan Air Self- Defense Force was formed at Komaki. Named the 404th Tactical Airlift Tanker Squadron, it is equipped with Boeing KC-767J aircraft. Incidents and accidents *On April 18, 1993, Japan Air System Flight 451, a Douglas DC-9-41 of Japan Air System flying from Nagoya to Hanamaki, crashed after the aircraft, caught by windshear, skidded off of the runway while landing at Hanamaki Airport. All of the passengers and crew survived. *On April 26, 1994, an Airbus A300B4-622R jet operating as China Airlines Flight 140 (B-1816) from Taipei to Nagoya crashed onto the south-east corner of the airport apron whilst trying to land on Runway 34, killing 264 of the 271 people on board. It is second deadliest crash on Japanese soil, after Japan Airlines Flight 123. *On October 31, 2007, a Mitsubishi F-2 fighter jet, whilst on a test flight, crashed and exploded in flames during takeoff. Both pilots survived the incident with minor injuries. *On May 30, 2015, Solar Impulse 2, en route from Nanjing Lukou International Airport in China to Kalaeloa Airport in Hawaii, made an emergency landing after diverting due to weather; it continued to Hawaii on 28 June.

In literature, there exist several slightly deviating definitions. Breeds are formed through genetic isolation and either natural adaptation to the environment or selective breeding, or a combination of the two. Despite the centrality of the idea of \\"breeds\\" to animal husbandry and agriculture, no single, scientifically accepted definition of the term exists.The state of the world's animal genetic resources for food and agriculture. Barbara Rischkowsky and Dafydd Pilling. Commission on Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture. 2007 It was shown by set-theoretic means that for the term breed an infinite number of different definitions, which more or less meet the common requirements found in literature, can be given. A breed is therefore not an objective or biologically verifiable classification but is instead a term of art amongst groups of breeders who share a consensus around what qualities make some members of a given species members of a nameable subset.The Genetics of Populations. Jay L Lush. Iowa State University Press. 1994 Another point of view is that a breed is consistent enough in type to be logically grouped together and when mated within the group produce the same type.Clutton-Brock, Juliet. 1987 A Natural History of Domesticated Mammals, Cambridge University Press and the Museum of Natural History, page 40. When bred together, individuals of the same breed pass on these predictable traits to their offspring, and this abilityknown as \\"breeding true\\"is a requirement for a breed. Plant breeds are more commonly known as cultivars. The offspring produced as a result of breeding animals of one breed with other animals of another breed are known as crossbreeds or mixed breeds. Crosses between animal or plant variants above the level of breed/cultivar (i.e. between species, subspecies, botanical variety, even different genera) are referred to as hybrids.Banga, Surinder S. (November 25, 1998). Hybrid Cultivar Development, p. 119. Springer-Verlag. Breeding: selection by breeders The breeder (or group of breeders) who initially establishes a breed does so by selecting individual animals from within a gene pool that they see as having the necessary qualities needed to enhance the breed model they are aiming for. These animals are referred to as foundation stock. Furthermore, the breeder mates the most desirable representatives of the breed from his or her point of view, aiming to pass such characteristics to their progeny. This process is known as selective breeding. A written description of desirable and undesirable breed representatives is referred to as a breed standard. Breed characteristics Breed specific characteristics, also known as breed traits, are inherited, and purebred animals pass such traits from generation to generation. Thus, all specimens of the same breed carry several genetic characteristics of the original foundation animal(s). In order to maintain the breed, a breeder would select those animals with the most desirable traits to achieve further maintenance and developing of such traits. At the same time, the breed would avoid animals carrying characteristics undesirable or not typical for the breed, including faults or genetic defects. The population within the same breed should consist of a sufficient number of animals to maintain the breed within the specified parameters without the necessity of forced inbreeding. Domestic animal breeds commonly differ from country to country, and from nation to nation. Breeds originating in a certain country are known as \\"native breeds\\" of that country.

Officially known as Hong Kong International Airport from 1954 to 6 July 1998, it is often referred to as Hong Kong International Airport, Kai Tak,Photo of Kai Tak Airport, shown the official name of the airport or simply Kai Tak and Kai Tak International Airport, to distinguish it from its successor, which is often referred to as Chek Lap Kok International Airport, located at the islands of Chek Lap Kok and Lam Chau, located to the west. Because of the geography of the area positioning the airport with water on all sides of the runway, with Kowloon City's residential apartment complexes and 2000+ft mountains to the north-east of the airport, aircraft could not fly over the mountains and quickly drop in for a final. Instead, aircraft had to fly above Victoria Harbour and Kowloon City, passing north of Mong Kok's Bishop Hill. After passing Bishop Hill, pilots would see Checkerboard Hill with a large red and white checkerboard pattern. Once the pattern was sighted and identified, aircraft made a low-altitude (sub-600 ft) 47¬∞ right-hand turn, ending with a short final and touchdown. For pilots, this airport was technically demanding, as the approach could not be flown by aircraft instruments, but rather visually because of the right-hand turn required. The History Channel program Most Extreme Airports ranked it as the 6th most dangerous airport in the world.Most Extreme Airports; The History Channel; 26 August 2010 The airport was home to Hong Kong's international carrier Cathay Pacific, as well as regional carrier Dragonair (now known as Cathay Dragon), freight airline Air Hong Kong and Hong Kong Airways. The airport was also home to the former RAF Kai Tak. Geographic environment The airport was surrounded by high-rise buildings. The airport car park is at the centre, and offices are on the right of the photograph. Kai Tak was located on the east side of Kowloon Bay in Kowloon, Hong Kong. The area is surrounded by rugged mountains. Less than to the north and northeast of the former runway 13 threshold is a range of hills reaching an elevation of . To the east of the former 31 threshold, the hills are less than away. Immediately to the south of the airport is Victoria Harbour, and farther south is Hong Kong Island with hills up to . When Kai Tak closed, there was only one runway in use, numbered 13/31 and oriented southeast‚Äìnorthwest (134/314 degrees true, 136/316 degrees magnetic). The runway was made by reclaiming land from the harbour and was extended several times after its initial construction. The runway was long when the airport closed, and when it was opened. This runway opened in 1958 and operated until the closure of the airport. Beforehand, in the period of 1945-1955 the airport used a different 13/31 alongside a crossing 07/25. These runways were and .https://gwulo.com/atom/25578/zoom At the northern end of the runway at closure, buildings rose up to six stories just across a major multi- lane arterial road. The other three sides of the runway were surrounded by Victoria Harbour. The low-altitude turning manoeuvre before the shortened final approach was so close to these buildings that passengers could spot television sets in the apartments: \\"...as the plane banked sharply to the right for landing ... the people watching television in the nearby apartments seemed an unsettling arms length away.\\" History =1925 to 1930s= The story of Kai Tak started in 1912 when two businessmen Ho Kai and Au Tak formed the Kai Tak Investment Company to reclaim land in Kowloon for development.Kai Tak Airport History , Hong Kong ATC history, Munsang College history The land was acquired by the government for use as an airfield after the business plan failed. In 1924, Harry Abbott opened The Abbott School of Aviation on that piece of land. Soon, it became a small grass strip runway airport for the RAF and several flying clubs which, over time, grew to include the Hong Kong Flying Club, the Far East Flying Training School, and the Aero Club of Hong Kong, which exist today as an amalgamation known as the Hong Kong Aviation Club. In 1928, a concrete slipway was built for seaplanes that used the adjoining Kowloon Bay. The first control tower and hangar at Kai Tak were built in 1935. In 1936, the first domestic airline in Hong Kong was established. =World War II= Hong Kong fell into the hands of the Japanese in 1941 during World War II. In 1942, the Japanese army expanded Kai Tak, using many Allied prisoner-of-war (POW) labourers,Work on Kai Tak Airport 11 September 1942 Newspaper Clipping building two concrete runways, 13/31 and 07/25. Numerous POW diary entries exist recalling the gruelling work and long hours working on building Kai Tak.Harry Atkinson,Thomas Smith Forsyth,Bernard Castonguay,Garfield Loew,John McGee Former POWs also recount their attempts to sabotage construction, which included mixing large amounts of clay with the concrete for the runways. During the process, the historic wall of the Kowloon Walled City and the tall Sung Wong Toi, a memorial for the last Song dynasty emperor, were destroyed for materials. A 2001 Environmental Study recommended that a new memorial be erected for the Sung Wong Toi rock and other remnants of the Kowloon area before Kai Tak. =1945 to 1970s= Aerial view of the airport in 1971, three years before the 1974 extension. From September 1945 to August 1946 the airport was a Royal Navy shore base, \\"HMS Nabcatcher\\",Royal Navy Archive the name previously attached to a Mobile Naval Air Base for the Fleet Air Arm. On 1 April 1947, a Royal Naval Air Station, HMS Flycatcher, was commissioned there. A plan to turn Kai Tak into a modern airport was released in 1954. By 1957 runway 13/31 had been extended to , while runway 7/25 remained long; night operations were not allowed.The Aeroplane 2 August 1957 Bristol Britannia 102s took over BOAC's London-Tokyo flights in summer 1957 and were the largest airliners scheduled to the old airport (Boeing Stratocruisers never flew there). In 1958 the new NW/SE runway extending into Kowloon Bay was completed by land reclamation. The passenger terminal was completed in 1962. The runway was extended in the mid-1970s to , the final length. This extension was completed in June 1974, but the full length of the runway was not in use until 31 December 1975, as construction of the new Airport Tunnel had kept the northwestern end of the runway closed. In 1955 Kai Tak Airport featured in the film The Night My Number Came Up. An Instrument Guidance System (IGS) was installed in 1974 to aid landing on runway 13. Use of the airport under adverse conditions was greatly increased. In the 1970s an aircraft crash called attention to the potential loss of life in the high- density residential developments around the airport, though there were no serious accidents. =Overcrowding in the 1980s and 1990s= The growth of Hong Kong also put a strain on the airport's capacity. Its usage was close to, and for some time exceeded, the designed capacity. The airport was designed to handle 24 million passengers per year, but in 1996, Kai Tak handled 29.5 million passengers, plus 1.56 million tonnes of freight, making it the third busiest airport in the world in terms of international passenger traffic, and busiest in terms of international cargo throughput. Moreover, clearance requirements for aircraft takeoffs and landings made it necessary to limit the height of buildings that could be built in Kowloon. While Kai Tak was initially located far away from residential areas, the expansion of both residential areas and the airport resulted in Kai Tak being close to residential areas. This caused serious noise and engine pollution for nearby residents and put height restrictions, which were removed after Kai Tak closed. A night curfew from 11:30 pm to 6:30 am in the early morning also hindered operations. 270x270px As a result, in the late 1980s, the Hong Kong Government began searching for alternative locations for a new airport in Hong Kong to replace the aging airport. After deliberating on a number of locations, including the south side of Hong Kong Island, the government decided to build the airport on the island of Chek Lap Kok off Lantau Island. The new airport is located far away from Hong Kong's main residential areas, conducive to minimising the dangers of a major crash and also reducing the nuisance of noise pollution. A huge number of resources were mobilised to build this new airport, part of the ten programmes in Hong Kong's Airport Core Programme. The Regal Meridien Hong Kong Airport Hotel, linked to the passenger terminal by a footbridge spanning Prince Edward Road, opened on 19 July 1982. This was Hong Kong's first airport hotel, and comprised 380 rooms including 47 suites. As of 2018 the hotel still exists, but the footbridge has been demolished. It is one of the few remaining buildings related to Kai Tak Airport. =Closure and legacy of Kai Tak Airport= The new airport officially opened on 6 July 1998 to replace the functions of the Kai Tak Airport. All of the essential airport supplies and vehicles that were left in the old airport for operation (some of the non-essential ones had already been transported to the new airport) were transported to Chek Lap Kok in one early morning with a single massive move, with a police escort. On 6 July 1998 at 01:28, after the last aircraft departed for Chek Lap Kok, Kai Tak was finally retired as an airport. The final flights were: * The last arrival: Dragonair KA841 from Chongqing Jiangbei International Airport (Airbus A320-200) landed Runway 13 at 23:38. * The last scheduled commercial flight: Cathay Pacific CX251 to Heathrow Airport (Boeing 747-400) took off from Runway 13 at 00:02. * The last departure: Cathay Pacific CX3340 ferry flight to the new Hong Kong International Airport (Airbus A340-300) took off from Runway 13 at 01:05. A small ceremony celebrating the end of the airport was held inside the control tower after the last flight took off. Richard Siegel, then-director of civil aviation, gave a brief speech ending with the words \\"Goodbye Kai Tak, and Thank you.\\", before dimming the lights briefly and then turning them off. After the last plane, a Cathay Pacific A340-300, took off from Kai Tak International Airport to the new Hong Kong International Airport at 01:28 HKT, Kai Tak was closed, transferring its ICAO and IATA airport codes to the replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok. For users of Flight Simulation Software, virtual ICAO code VHHX or VHXX are used to represent Kai Tak when Kai Tak and Chek Lap Kok coexist. Government reports later revealed that Chek Lap Kok airport was not completely ready to be opened to the public despite trial runs held. Water supply and sewers were not installed completely. Telephones were installed, but the lines were not connected. The baggage system did not undergo extensive troubleshooting and passenger baggage as well as cargo, much of which was perishable, were lost. The government decided to temporarily reactivate Kai Tak's cargo terminal to minimise the damage caused by a software bug in the new airport's cargo handling system. During this period, the airport was given temporary ICAO code VHHX. The passenger terminal later housed government offices, automobile dealerships and showrooms, a go-kart racecourse, a bowling alley, a snooker hall, a golf range and other recreational facilities. In the mid 2000s, the passenger terminal and hangars were demolished. Many aviation enthusiasts were upset at the demise of Kai Tak because of the unique runway 13 approach. As private aviation was no longer allowed at Chek Lap Kok (having moved to Sek Kong Airfield), some enthusiasts had lobbied to keep about of the Kai Tak runway for general aviation, but the suggestion was rejected as the Government had planned to build a new cruise terminal at Kai Tak. The Hong Kong stop of Celine Dion's Let's Talk About Love World Tour was held on the airport's runway on 25 January 1999. Until its retirement in 2018, the name Kai Tak was one of the names used in the lists of tropical cyclone names in the northwest Pacific Ocean. Submitted by Hong Kong, it was used four times. Former airlines and destinations =Passenger= Operations A Cathay Pacific Boeing 747-300 landing at Kai Tak Airport runway 13 Airport forecourt =Terminals and facilities= The Kai Tak airport consisted of a linear passenger terminal building with a car park attached at the rear. There were eight boarding gates attached to the terminal building.Sung Hin-lun: A Hundred Years of Aviation in Hong Kong. A freight terminal was located on the south side of the east apron and diagonally from the passenger terminal building. Due to the limited space, the fuel tank farm was located between the passenger terminal and HAECO maintenance facilities (hangar). =Companies based at Kai Tak= Northwest Cargo 747-200F landing. Several airlines were based at Kai Tak: * Cathay Pacific, which operated a mixed Airbus, Boeing and some Lockheed all-widebody fleet of one hundred aircraft, providing scheduled services to the rest of Asia, Australia, New Zealand, the Middle East, Europe, South Africa and North America. * Dragonair * Air Hong Kong Limited * Hong Kong Airways (Until Late 1950s when bought by Cathay Pacific) *British Asia Airways (Due to relations between PRC and ROC) Other tenants included: * Hong Kong Aviation Club * Government Flying Service * DFS Kai Tak Market * H√§agen Dazs * Tin Tin Airport Restaurant =Runway 13 approach= Layout of Kai Tak Airport prior to its 1998 closure An Air France Boeing 747-400 passing above the very crowded Kowloon City during its approach and landing.

The landing approach for planes using runway 13 at Kai Tak was considered spectacular and was infamous, not just amongst aviation enthusiasts but amongst the general public as well. Flight sim charts, which are based on the real charts used on the airport, give an outline on the procedures used on approach into Kai Tak Airport.https://www.platinumairways.org/files/DOTW_Charts/VHHX.pdf Checkerboard approach The Checkerboard Approach (also spelled as Chequerboard approach) initially begins to the south-west of the airport, heading 270 at a minimum altitude of 6000 ft. At this beginning stage of the approach, the aircraft should be passing above Cheung Chau - a small island just off Lantau Island. After that, the aircraft was required to proceed up to \\"Point Golf\\", which was on the south side of Lantau Island and directly south of the current Chek Lap Kok Airport. Approaching aircraft then had to make a right-hand U-turn in order to intercept the localiser for the Runway 13 IGS, which generally happened above the current Chek Lap Kok Airport site. The IGS was, in essence, a heavily modified ILS system designed uniquely for Kai Tak Airport, otherwise functioning identical to a normal ILS. At roughly ~2500 ft, the autopilot was disconnected, and the rest of the approach was flown manually. The aircraft then descended below 1000 ft and shortly afterwards reached Kowloon Tsai Park and its small hill. Upon reaching the small hill above Kowloon Tsai Park, which was painted with a large \\"aviation orange\\" and white checkerboard (), used as a visual reference point on the final approach (in addition to the middle marker on the Instrument Guidance System), the pilot needed to make a 47¬∞ visual right turn to line up with the runway and complete the final leg. The aircraft would be just from touchdown, at a height of less than when the turn was made. Typically the plane would enter the final right turn at a height of about and exit it at a height of to line up with the runway. That demanding manoeuvre became known in the aviation community as the \\"Hong Kong Turn\\" or the \\"Checkerboard Turn\\". For many airline passengers on planes approaching and landing on Runway 13 at Kai Tak Airport, it became referred to as the \\"Kai Tak Heart Attack\\", because they were often frightened to be turning at such a close proximity to the ground, which, at less than 150 ft, or 45 metres, was generally less than even the Boeing 767's wingspan, which is considered a medium-size airliner. The turn was so low that passengers could see television sets running in people's residences near the airport. Handling the runway 13 approach was difficult enough with normal crosswinds because, even if the wind direction was constant, it was changing relative to the aircraft as the plane made the 47¬∞ visual right turn, meaning that what would be a headwind heading directly east on the IGS would become a crosswind and begin to push the aircraft over and off the runway alignment without correction. The landing would become even more challenging when crosswinds from the north-east were strong and gusty during typhoons. The mountain range north-east of the airport also made the wind vary greatly in both speed and direction. Watching large aircraft banking at low altitudes and taking big crab angles during their final approaches was popular with plane spotters. Despite the difficulty, the runway 13 approach was used most of the time due to the prevailing wind direction in Hong Kong. Because of the turn required during final approach, ILS was not available for runway 13 and landings had to follow a visual approach. This made the approach unusable in low visibility conditions. Stonecutters' Approach Alongside the Chequerboard approach, there was a lesser known approach into Kai Tak that led aircraft over the Stonecutters' DME at a heading of 040 and led into a ~90¬∞ turn to line up on Runway 13. This approach was used extremely infrequently, since the Chequerboard approach had a localiser and glide slope to work off of, and DMEs are very rarely used in commercial aviation today. It generally can be assumed this approach was used when the localiser and glide slope were offline for maintenance. =Runway 13 departure= Runway 13 was the preferred departure runway for heavy aircraft due to the clear departure path, opposite that of the runway 31 departure. Heavy aircraft on departure using runway 13 would often need nearly the entire length of the runway, particularly during summer days due to the air temperature. =Runway 31 approach= Runway 31 approaches and landings were similar to other airports in which ILS was available. Runways 13 and 31 are, in fact, the same physical runway, however if a flight is landing on Runway 13 that means that the aircraft is flying in on a south-easterly direction, while a flight landing on Runway 31 would be coming in a north-westerly direction. This applies for flights taking off on runways 13 and 31 - a flight departing from runway 13 would be heading south- east, and vice versa. This is because runways are named for their magnetic heading in decadegrees, which means that a runway oriented anywhere between 125¬∞ and 134¬∞ magnetic would be numbered 13, and vice versa. The path towards the runway passed within 300 metres to the north of Heng Fa Chuen on Hong Kong Island. =Runway 31 departure= When lined up for takeoff on runway 31, a range of hills including Beacon Hill would be right in front of the aircraft. The aircraft had to make a sharp 65-degree left turn soon after takeoff to avoid the hills (i.e. the reverse of a Runway 13 landing). If a runway change occurred due to wind change from runway 13 departures to runway 31 departures, planes that were loaded to maximum payload for runway 13 departures had to return to the terminal to offload some goods to provide enough climbing clearance over buildings during a runway 31 departure. =Private aviation= Hong Kong Aviation Club building at the former Kai Tak Airport, with the headquarters of the Hong Kong Air Cadet Corps The Hong Kong Aviation Club formerly held most of its activities at Kai Tak, where it had hangars and other facilities. The club moved most of its aircraft to Shek Kong Airfield in 1994 after the hours for general aviation at Kai Tak were sharply reduced, to two hours per morning, as of 1 July that year. Kai Tak closed to fixed-wing traffic in 1998. The club ended its helicopter activities at Kai Tak on 9 July 2017.\\"Hong Kong Aviation Club responds to media enquiries.\\" Hong Kong Aviation Club. 27 May 2017. Retrieved on 18 April 2018. Chinese version. The Kai Tak location, which it was able to use all days of the week, meant that helicopter training took less time compared to fixed-wing training, as usage at Shek Kong is restricted to weekends. Incidents and accidents China Airlines Flight 605 crashed into Victoria Harbour after it failed to stop on the runway during a typhoon Many planes crashed at Kai Tak due to poor weather and hard approach: * On 25 January 1947, a Philippine Air Lines DC-3 aircraft crashed into Mount Parker, killing four crew members. * On 21 December 1948, a China National Aviation Corporation Douglas DC-4 struck Basalt Island after a descent through clouds. 35 were killed. * On 24 February 1949, a Cathay Pacific Douglas DC-3 crashed into a hillside near Braemar Reservoir after aborting an approach in poor visibility and attempting to go around. All 23 on board were killed. * On 11 March 1951, a Pacific Overseas Airlines Douglas DC-4 crashed after takeoff into the hills between Mount Butler and Mount Parker on Hong Kong Island. The captain of the aircraft allegedly failed to execute the turn left operation after departure. 24 were killed. * On 9 April 1951, a Siamese Airways Douglas DC-3 lost control on its turn while attempting a night-time visual approach. The captain allegedly allowed the aircraft to lose speed while attempting to turn quickly. 16 were killed. * On 19 April 1961, a US military Douglas DC-3 (C-47 Skytrain) bound for Formosa crashed into Mount Parker after takeoff. Of the 16 on board, 15 were killed. * On 24 August 1965, a United States Marine Corps C-130 Hercules crashed shortly after takeoff from runway 13, killing 59 of the 71 people on board. This was the deadliest accident at Kai Tak. * On 30 June 1967, a Thai Airways International Sud Aviation SE-210 Caravelle III crashed into Victoria Harbour while trying to land during a torrential rainstorm. A typhoon was some NW of Hong Kong, but the colony was not closed down in preparation of the typhoon. The co-pilot, who was flying the aircraft and unable to see the runway due to the heavy rain, allegedly made an abrupt heading change, causing the aircraft to enter a high rate of descent and crash into the harbour to the right of the runway. The starboard wing snapped off on impact, and the aircraft rolled onto its starboard side, halving the number of escape routes. 24 were killed, but only 23 bodies were recovered at the scene. The final body was recovered after it was seen floating in the harbour six weeks later. * On 2 September 1977, a Transmeridian Air Cargo Canadair CL-44 lost control and crashed into the Tathong Channel on fire shortly after takeoff. The no. 4 engine was said to have failed, causing an internal fire in the engine and the aircraft fuel system that eventually resulted in a massive external fire. Four were killed. * On 9 March 1978, a China Airlines Boeing 737-200 was hijacked. The hijacker (the flight engineer of the flight) demanded to be taken to Mainland China (the airline was of the Republic of China on Taiwan, not the People's Republic of China, which controlled the mainland). The hijack lasted less than a day, and the hijacker was killed. *On 7 February 1980, a China Airlines Boeing 747-200 B-1866 (later B-18255) had a tail-strike incident while landing at Kai Tak International Airport on route to Taipei. The aircraft was improperly repaired which caused it to break up in flight on 25 May 2002 while flying to Chek Lap Kok International Airport. * On 18 October 1983, a Lufthansa Boeing 747 freighter abandoned takeoff after engine no. 2 malfunctioned, probably at speed exceeding V1 (the takeoff/abort decision point). The aircraft overran the runway onto soft ground and sustained severe damage. The three crew on board suffered only minor injuries. * On 31 August 1988, the right outboard flap of a CAAC Airlines Hawker Siddeley Trident operating Flight 301 hit approach lights of runway 31 while landing under rain and fog. The right main landing gear then struck a lip and collapsed, causing the aircraft to run off the runway and slip into the harbour. 7 were killed. * On 4 November 1993, a China Airlines Boeing 747-400, operating Flight 605, overran the runway while landing during a typhoon. The wind was gusting to gale force at the time. Despite the plane's unstable approach, the captain did not go around. It touched down more than 2/3 down the runway and was unable to stop before the runway ended. Although the aircraft ended up submerged beyond the end of the runway, there were only 23 minor injuries amongst the 396 passengers and crew. * On 23 September 1994, a Heavylift Cargo Airlines Lockheed L-100-30 Hercules lost control shortly after takeoff from runway 13. The pitch control system of one of its propellers was said to have failed. Six were killed. Redevelopment Aerial view of the Kai Tak Development site in 2017 Kai Ching Estate is the first housing estate to be built on the old Kai Tak Airport site. It is located on the north eastern side of the site, where the maintenance area was located Kai Tak Runway Park with its former runway number: 13 =2002 blueprint= In October 1998, the Government drafted a plan for the Kai Tak Airport site, involving the reclamation of of land. After receiving many objections, the Government scaled down the reclamation to in June 1999. The Territorial Development Department commenced a new study on the development of the area in November 1999, entitled \\"Feasibility Studies on the Revised Southeast Kowloon Development Plan\\", and a new public consultation exercise was conducted in May 2000, resulting in the land reclamation being further scaled down to . The new plans based on the feasibility studies were passed by the chief executive in July 2002.Planning history of Kai Tak There were plans for the site of Kai Tak to be used for housing development, which was once projected to house around 240,000‚Äì340,000 residents. Due to calls from the public to protect the harbour and participate more deeply in future town planning, the scale and plan of the project were yet to be decided. There were also plans for a railway station and maintenance centre in the proposed plan for the Sha Tin to Central Link. There were also proposals to dredge the runway to form several islands for housing, to build a terminal capable of accommodating cruise ships the size of Queen Mary 2, and more recently, to house the Hong Kong Sports Institute, as well as several stadiums, in the case that the institute was forced to move so that the equestrian events of the 2008 Summer Olympics could be held at its present site in Sha Tin. On 9 January 2004, the Court of Final Appeal ruled that no reclamation plan for Victoria Harbour could be introduced unless it passed an \\"overriding public interest\\" test. Subsequently, the Government abandoned these plans. =Kai Tak Planning Review= The Government set up a \\"Kai Tak Planning Review\\" in July 2004 for further public consultation. A number of plans were presented. June 2006 blueprint A new plan for the redevelopment of Kai Tak was issued by the government in June 2006. Under these proposals, hotels would be scattered throughout the site, and flats aimed at housing 86,000 new residents were proposed. Other features of the plan included two cruise terminals and a large stadium. October 2006 blueprint The Planning Department unveiled a major reworking of its plans for the old Kai Tak airport site on 17 October 2006, containing \\"a basket of small measures designed to answer a bevy of concerns raised by the public\\". The revised blueprint will also extend several \\"green corridors\\" from the main central park into the surrounding neighbourhoods of Kowloon City, Kowloon Bay and Ma Tau Kok. The following features are proposed in the revised plan: * two cruise terminals, with a third terminal to be added if the need arises * a luxury hotel complex near the cruise terminals‚Äîthe complex would sit about seven stories high, with hotel rooms atop commercial or tourist-related spaces * an eight-station monorail linking the tourist hub with Kwun Tong * a large stadium * a central park to provide green space * a high public viewing tower near the tip of the runway * a new bridge, likely to involve further reclamation of Victoria Harbour The following are major changes: * hotel spaces are to be centralised near the end of the runway, and will face into the harbour towards Central * a third cruise terminal could be added at the foot of the hotel cluster if the need arises * a second row of luxury residential spaces is to be added facing Kwun Tong, built on an elevated terrace or platform to preserve a view of the harbour The government has promised that: * the total amount of housing and hotel space will remain the same as proposed in June 2006 * plot ratios will be the same as before * the total commercial space on the site will also remain about the same The new bridge proposed by the government, joining the planned hotel district at the end of the runway with Kwun Tong, could be a potential source of controversy. Under the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance, no harbour reclamation can take place unless the Government can demonstrate to the courts an \\"overriding public need\\". The new Kai Tak blueprint was presented to the Legislative Council on 24 October 2006 after review by the Town Planning Board. Panorama of the former Kai Tak Airport Site (2010) =2011 onwards= In 2011, with most of the former Kai Tak area still abandoned, ideas were floated to develop the area for commercial property, citing shortages of office space and rising property costs. In June 2013, the Kai Tak Cruise Terminal was opened on the tip of the former runway. Two public housing estates opened on the northeast area of the site in 2013, providing over 13,000 new rental flats. As of 2018, the public estates have been joined by some private residential developments, now nearing completion. A small park and new hospital (Hong Kong Children's Hospital) have also opened. A new Mass Transit Railway (MTR) station, Kai Tak, opened on the former airport land in early 2020. Another station, Sung Wong Toi, is nearing completion. Construction of the Kai Tak Sports Park on the former airport land has also commenced in April 2019. Once completed, Kai Tak Sports Park will be the largest sports venue in Hong Kong and will include a 50,000 seat Main Stadium, an Indoor Sports Center, a Public Sports Ground and multiple open spaces.

They have traditionally been considered a distinct family Dendrocolaptidae, but most authorities now place them as a subfamily of the ovenbirds (Furnariidae). They superficially resemble the Old World treecreepers, but they are unrelated and the similarities are due to convergent evolution. The subfamily contains around 57 species in 15 to 20 genera.Marantz, C. A.; Aleixo, A.; Bevier, L. R.; Patten, M. A., (2003): Family Dendrocolaptidae (Woodcreepers). In: del Hoyo, Josep; Elliott, Andrew & Sargatal, Jordi (editors): Handbook of Birds of the World, Volume 6: Broadbills to Tapaculos: 358‚Äì447. Lynx Edicions, Barcelona. Woodcreepers range from 14 to 35 cm in length. Generally brownish birds, the true woodcreepers maintain an upright vertical posture, supported by their specialized stiff tails. They feed mainly on insects taken from tree trunks. However, woodcreepers often form part of the core group at the centre of flocks attending army ant swarms. Woodcreepers are arboreal cavity-nesting birds; two or three white eggs are laid and incubated for about 15 to 21 days. These birds can be difficult to identify in that they tend to have similar brown upperparts, and the more distinctive underparts are hard to see on a bird pressed against a trunk in deep forest shade. The bill shape, extend/shape of spots/streaks, and call are useful aids to determining species. Description The wedge-billed woodcreeper is the smallest species in the subfamily (the xenops are smaller, but their exact taxonomic position has not been resolved). The woodcreepers are generally fairly uniform in appearance. They range in size from the wedge-billed woodcreeper () to the strong-billed woodcreeper (). Males tend to be slightly larger than females on average, but considerable overlap in size occurs in most species. Pronounced sexual dimorphism in size and plumage is rare. Bill size and shape accounts for much of the variation between the species. Bills can be straight or highly decurved, and can account for as much as a quarter of the length of the bird (as happens in the long-billed woodcreeper). The plumage is usually subdued and often brown, or sometimes rufous or other dark colours. Many species have patterns such as checking, spotting, or barring on their plumage. The feathers of the tail are rigid and are used for supporting the body when climbing tree trunks; the tail can support most of the body weight and birds that lose their tail find climbing difficult. Woodcreepers climb by flexing their legs and hopping up the trunk. The feet of the woodcreepers are also modified for climbing. The front toes are strongly clawed and toe IV is as long as toe III to increase the ability of the bird to grasp around branches. The legs are short but strong. Woodcreepers are also characterized by a belly feather growth pattern not found in any other birds. Habitat and distribution The scimitar-billed woodcreeper is unusual for the subfamily in living in open woodlands, and in being predominately a ground forager. The woodcreepers are generally forest birds of Central and South America. Most species occur in rainforests, with the centre of diversity of the subfamily being the Amazon Basin. As many as 19 species of woodcreeper may co-occur in some areas of the Amazon, although in other rainforests, such as those in Costa Rica, the numbers are much lower. Other habitats used by the woodcreepers include pine- oak woodland, montane cloud forest, and pine forests. A few species, like the scimitar-billed woodcreeper, inhabit savannah or other partly open environments. Woodcreepers are absent from the temperate forests of southern South America. Behaviour =Diet and feeding= The woodcreepers are insectivores that are mostly arboreal in nature. Insects form the majority of the diet, with some spiders, centipedes, millipedes and even lizards being taken as well. A few specimens collected by scientists had fruit or seeds in their stomachs, but plant material is not thought to be regularly taken by any species. A few species forage on the ground, but most forage on the trunks of trees, on and on the underside of branches. They are generally solitary or occur in pairs, but frequently join mixed-species feeding flocks. The flocks they join are usually the lower level ones rather than canopy flocks, and are usually those insectivorous ones rather than frugivorous ones. Prey is almost always obtained by moving up the trunk or branch, and there are two main foraging techniques, probing and sallying. Probers investigate rough bark, mosses, masses of trapped dead leaves, bromeliads, and other areas where prey may be hiding, whereas those that sally launch into the air briefly to snatch prey that has been flushed by their movement. Several species regularly attend swarms of army ants to catch prey flushed by the ants. Systematics The former family has been merged into the ovenbird family, Furnariidae, by most authorities because analyses of mt and nDNA sequence data showed Sclerurus leaftossers and Geositta miners to be basal to the Furnariidae and the woodcreepers. An alternative option was recommended by Moyle et al. (2009), in which the woodcreepers maintain their status as a family, while the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) are split into two families: Scleruridae and Furnariidae. The genus Xenops, which have usually been considered ovenbirds, represent an early divergence. Although some analyses suggested that they are more closely related to the woodcreepers than to true furnariids, other studies have not found the same results. Others suggested placing Xenops in its own family Xenopidae. Evolutionary relationships among woodcreeper species are now fairly well known thanks to the use of DNA sequence data. Some previous results based on morphology were not supported by molecular data, mostly due to instances of convergent evolution in beak morphology. Plumage patterns, on the other hand, are more in agreement with the molecular data. DNA studies revealed that Deconychura species belong into separate genera and that the Greater scythebill should be placed in its won genus. Moving Lepidocolaptes fuscus to Xiphorhynchus restores monophyly of Lepidocolaptes. Additionally, the species-level taxonomy of several groups requires further study. Examples of \\"species\\" where vocal and morphological variations suggests that more than one species-level taxon could be involved are the curve-billed scythebill and the white-chinned, olivaceous, strong-billed and straight- billed woodcreepers. The genus Xiphorhynchus also requires much more research in this regard. Hylexetastes may contain anything from one to four species.

About 43 per cent of the population is Swedish-speaking. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . The neighboring municipalities of Liljendal, Pern√• and Ruotsinpyht√§√§ were consolidated with Loviisa on 1 January 2010. Loviisa was founded in 1745, as a border fortress against Russia. Most of the fortifications have been preserved. Loviisa was originally called Degerby, but king Adolf Frederick of Sweden renamed the city after his spouse Lovisa Ulrika after visiting the town in 1752. Loviisa is the site of two of Finland's nuclear reactors, two VVER units each of 488 MWe, at the Loviisa Nuclear Power Plant. The other operating reactors are at the Olkiluoto Nuclear Power Plant.

The purpose of the sea fortress was to protect the city from the sea, as well as to offer safe haven for the Swedish coastal navy. A joint Anglo-French navy unit destroyed the battlements of the island during the Crimean War. No longer fit for use the fortress was left to decay. As of the 1960s the fortress has been restored led by the National Board of Antiquities. The restoration was brought to a conclusion in time for the 250th jubilee of the fortress in 1998. During the summers various programmes are arranged on the island for both locals and tourists. The guided tours, an exciting adventure for juniors and a restaurant lure both boaters and people travelling by the ferry boat, which does regular traffic between Loviisa centre and Svartholm. Loviisa is also renowned for its Old Town. The Old Town was spared from the great fire of 1855. An annex of the Degerby estate, dating from the 17th century, is located in the Old Town. The building is one of the oldest surviving wooden houses in Finland. In Loviisa there is also a high society clubhouse, the only one of its kind in Finland spared from fires. Having been restored it now is a library/mediatheque. The first church in Loviisa was destroyed during the fire. The current Neo-Gothic church was inaugurated in 1865. The German Brandenstein division landed in Valko in Loviisa on April 7, 1918. The division advanced as far as to Lahti, before returning to Loviisa in order to leave the country on December 16, 1918, as Germany had lost World War I. The summers are lively in Loviisa. The most popular summer events are the Historical Houses of Loviisa (an event for traditional house building and renovating), the Sibelius Days, the Loviisa Day on August 25 and the King Arrives in Loviisa (a weekend in the spirit of the 18th century), Small Ships' Race (festival for traditional small sailing ships), the Peace Forum and the horse trotting contests  Industry  Loviisa boasts many companies useful for the local tourism. The harbour in Valko and the Loviisa Power Plant bring industry to Loviisa. There is also an industrial park in the Uusikaupunki district, housing many smaller companies, for instance mechanical shops and retail sellers of spare parts. There is a harbour for cargoes such as timber, bulk and parcelled goods in the southern city district of Valko. From the harbour there is a traffic connection to Route 7, the major highway between Helsinki and St Petersburg. Loviisa centre is located immediately by Route 7, equally close to Helsinki and the Russian border. There is also a train connection from the harbour to Lahti, from where the carriages can reach other destinations in the country. The route into the harbour is 9.5 meters deep.

It was the first free newspaper in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong version was first launched on 15 April 2002; it is distributed for free in the racks located in 49 Mass Transit Railway (MTR) stations except the Airport Station. According to the Hong Kong Audit Bureau of Circulations in September 2002, the daily circulation of the newspaper was 302,197 copies, making it the third largest daily newspaper in Hong Kong. The paper is distributed from Monday to Friday (except for public holidays), by hand or from the newspaper stands in 49 MTR stations and 11 other key central locations, such as big shopping malls owned by MTR Corporation Limited like Paradise Mall, Telford Plaza, and Luk Yeung Galleria (). Since it is free of charge and easily accessible, many people like to get one on their way to school or work. The paper attracts a younger generation of readers with a great purchasing power likewise, therefore many advertisers are interested in promoting their products on Metro Daily. The operating costs of the paper are mainly covered by the classified advertisements in the newspaper. However, the influence of the paper is not yet significant. Though around one tenth size of other newspapers printing local first-hand news reported by fresh journalists, its main news sources are actually the television, radio news, press releases and wired news. As one Metro reporter said, \\"Nobody seems to know that we made an exclusive story.\\" The paper is in Chinese in most parts, together with an English international section. According to Metro, the paper can be read in a \\"19-minute commute\\" as the articles inside are usually short and laconic; readers can scan through the paper so quickly that they can grab a brief understanding of the news within minutes. Although the paper is a tabloid, i.e. a minute-sized newspaper giving the stories in a condensed form, it includes many sections, which make the paper very rich in contents. These sections include: *local news (including one page written in Simplified Chinese); *Chinese news; *international news; *finance; *sports; *entertainment; *side stories; *English news digest; *editorial column; *television program schedule; and *film section. Readers can read the on-line edition of Metro all over the world by simply registering as users at its official site, and it is totally free.

Because it was within the territory of the former Russian Empire and the former Soviet Union, it was the highest mountain in the Russian Empire and Soviet Union before Tajikistan became independent. The mountain is named after Ismail Samani, a ruler of the Samanid dynasty. It is located in the Pamir Range. Name When the existence of a peak in the Soviet Pamir Mountains higher than Lenin Peak was first established in 1928, the mountain was tentatively identified with Garmo Peak. However, as the result of the work of further Soviet expeditions, it became clear by 1932 that they were not the same, and in 1933 the new peak, in the Academy of Sciences Range, was named Stalin Peak (), after Joseph Stalin. In 1962, as part of Khrushchev's nationwide de-Stalinization process, the name was changed to Communism Peak ( ), a name by which it is still commonly known. The name Communism Peak was officially dropped in 1998 in favour of the current name, commemorating the 9th-10th century Samanid emir, Ismail Samani.

It is named after the type genus Tyrannus. These have a different anatomy of the syrinx musculature than the oscines (songbirds of the larger suborder Passeri), hence its common name of suboscines. The available morphological, DNA sequence, and biogeographical data, as well as the (scant) fossil record, agree that these two major passerine suborders are evolutionarily distinct clades. Systematics The suborder Tyranni is divided into two infraorders: the Eurylaimides and the Tyrannides. The New Zealand wrens in the family Acanthisittidae are placed in a separate suborder Acanthisitti. The Eurylaimides contain the Old World suboscines ‚Äì mainly distributed in tropical regions around the Indian Ocean ‚Äì and a single American species, the sapayoa: * Philepittidae: asities * Eurylaimidae: typical broadbills * Calyptomenidae: African and green broadbills * Sapayoidae: broad-billed sapayoa * Pittidae: pittas Phylogenetic relationships of the Eurylaimides based on Oliveros et al. (2019): The Tyrannides contain all the suboscines from the Americas, except the broad-billed sapayoa. The families listed here are those recognised by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC). * Pipridae: manakins * Cotingidae: cotingas * Tityridae: tityras, sharpbill, becards (includes Oxyruncus and Onychorhynchus) * Tyrannidae: tyrant-flycatchers (includes Piprites, Platyrinchus, Tachuris and Rhynchocyclus) * Melanopareiidae: crescent chests * Conopophagidae: gnateaters and gnatpittas * Thamnophilidae: antbirds * Grallariidae: antpittas * Rhinocryptidae: tapaculos * Formicariidae: antthrushes * Furnariidae: ovenbirds and woodcreepers (includes Dendrocolaptidae) Phylogenetic relationships of the Tyrannides based on Oliveros et al. (2019): This group has been separated into three parvorders by Sibley & Ahlquist. However, DNA-DNA hybridization has shown to be not very well suited to reliably resolve the suboscine phylogeny. It was eventually determined that there was a simple dichotomy between the antbirds and allies (tracheophones), and the tyrant-flycatchers and allies. A conceivable vernacular name would be \\"bronchophones\\". This would parallel the German vernacular names, Luftr√∂hrenschreier (tracheophones) and Bronchienschreier (bronchophones). Given that the \\"parvorder\\" arrangement originally advanced is certainly obsolete (see e.g. Irestedt et al. 2002 for tracheophone phylogeny) - more so if the Eurylaimides are elevated to a distinct suborder - it would be advisable to rank the clades as superfamilies, or if the broadbill group is considered a separate suborder, as infraorders. In the former case, the name Furnarioidea would be available for the tracheophones, whereas \\"Tyrannoidea\\", the \\"bronchophone\\" equivalent, has not yet been formally defined. And thus should not be used without quotation marks. In the latter case, the tracheophones would be classified as \\"Furnariides\\", See remark at \\"Tyrannoidea\\". This peculiarity is explained by the fact that Sibley & Ahlquist's analyses erroneously suggested an overly complex phylogeny for the tracheophones, and a much simpler one for the tyrant-flycatchers and allies. while the Tyrannides would be restricted to the tyrant-flycatchers and other \\"bronchophone\\" families. The tracheophones contain the Furnariidae, Thamnophilidae, Formicariidae (probably including most tapaculos), and Conopophagidae. The tyrant-flycatcher clade includes the namesake family, the Tityridae, the Cotingidae, and the Pipridae.

Contrary to the claim on the title page shown here, the first volume had already appeared at the Leipzig Michaelmas Fair of 1731. The Grosses vollst√§ndiges Universal-Lexicon aller Wissenschafften und K√ºnste () is a 68-volume German encyclopedia published by Johann Heinrich Zedler between 1731 and 1754. It was one of the largest printed encyclopedias ever, and the first to include biographies of living people in a systematic way. Title The bookseller and publisher Zedler published this book in Leipzig under the name Great Complete Encyclopedia of All Sciences and Arts Which So Far Have Been Invented and Improved by Human Mind and Wit: Including the Geographical and Political Description of the Whole World with All Monarchies, Empires, Kingdoms, Principalities, Republics, Free Sovereignties, Countries, Towns, Sea Harbors, Fortresses, Castles, Areas, Authorities, Monasteries, Mountains, Passes, Woods, Seas, Lakes ... and also a Detailed Historical and Genealogical Description of the World's Brightest and Most Famous Family Lines, the Life and Deeds of the Emperors, Kings, Electors and Princes, Great Heroes, Ministers of State, War Leaders... ; Equally about All Policies of State, War and Law and Budgetary Business of the Nobility and the Bourgeois, Merchants, Traders, Arts. Zedler himself called his encyclopedia \\"Zedler's Encyclopedia\\" (Zedlersches Lexikon). Many previous encyclopedias were associated with the names of their authors, but the Universal Lexicon was the first to be associated with the name of its publisher.Compare Jeff Loveland, \\"Varieties of Authorship in Eighteenth- Century Encyclopedias,\\" Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert 34 (2010): 88-89. Editors The main editors were Jacob August Franckenstein (volumes 1-2), Paul Daniel Longolius (volumes 3-18), and Carl G√ºnther Ludovici (volumes 19-64 and supplements). Each seems to have taken a different approach to encyclopedia-making.Notice, for example, how the coverage of mathematics varied from editor to editor, as shown by Sergio Nobre, ‚ÄúLa difusi√≥n de las matem√°ticas en la primera mitad del siglo XVIII en Alemania a trav√©s de la gran enciclopedia universal,‚Äù Llull 18 (1995): 113-33. From volume 18 onward, for example, the encyclopedia contains numerous biographies of living people, presumably because of Ludovici's appointment as editor around the same time.Ulrich Johannes Schneider, Die Erfindung des allgemeinen Wissens (Berlin: Akademie, 2013), 101. In his introduction to volume 1, Zedler himself claimed to have had the encyclopedia compiled by nine anonymous \\"muses.\\" Scholars continue to debate over how many or few collaborators he actually had.See Katrin L√∂ffler, ‚ÄúWer schrieb den Zedler?‚Äù Leipziger Jahrbuch zur Buchgeschichte 16 (2007), 265-83. In fact, almost nothing certain is known about the individual authors of the encyclopedia. Heinrich Winkler wrote many medical articles, and Friedrich August M√ºller probably wrote articles on philosophy.Ulrich Johannes Schneider, \\"Die Konstruktion des allgemeinen Wissens in Zedlers Universallexikon,\\" in Wissenssicherung, Wissensordnung und Wissensverarbeitung: Das europ√§ische Modell der Enzyklop√§dien, ed. Theo Stammen et al. (Berlin: Akademie Verlag, 2004), 87n. Lorenz Christoph Mizler (1711‚Äì1778) claimed to have written mathematical articles. Johann Heinrich Rother and Johann Christoph Gottsched have also been suggested as possible collaborators, though both denied it.Ines Prod√∂hl, \\"¬¥Aus denen besten Scribenten¬¥: Zedlers Universal-Lexicon im Spannungsfeld zeitgen√∂ssischer Lexikonproduktion,\\" Das achtzehnte Jahrhundert 29 (2005): 89-91. Printing The Grosses vollst√§ndiges Universal-Lexicon is sometimes considered the first modern encyclopedia in the German language. At the time, it was the largest printed encyclopedia in the Western world, and it remains one of the largest.Jeff Loveland, \\"Why Encyclopedias Got Bigger ... and Smaller,\\" Information & Culture 47 (2012): 233-54. It was originally supposed to be printed in about 12 volumes, an estimate later extended to 24, but it was finally printed in 64 volumes plus four supplements, with about 284,000 articles on 63,000 two-column pages. Ludovici had even intended to write a further four supplements. Initial production was funded through subscription, where buyers paid in advance and received a discount on the volume that was later delivered. The pressrun of the Universal Lexicon was undoubtedly small. Scholars have estimated that only around 1500 sets were printed.Fritz Juntke, \\"Johann Heinrich Zedler's Grosses Vollst√§ndiges Universallexikon: Ein Beitrag zur Geschichte des Nachdruckes in Mitteldeutschland,\\" in Fritz Junkte zu seinem 70. Geburtstag, ed. Gottfried Langer (Halle: Schriften zum Bibliotheks- und B√ºchereiwesen in Sachsen-Anhalt, 1956), 19.

She is most famous for her work in the field of graphic adventure games with titles such as Mystery House, the King's Quest series, and Phantasmagoria. She is married to Ken Williams and retired in 1999. Roberta Williams is one of the most influential PC game designers of the 1980s and 1990s, and has been credited with creating the graphic adventure genre.  Career  = Beginnings = In 1979, Williams was a housewife with two kids and no experience or particular interest in computers. Meanwhile, her husband, Ken, worked for a computer company on huge IBM mainframe machines. It was around that time that the Apple computer was becoming a popular item in people's homes. Ken saw the potential home computing could have for the future and brought his enthusiasm home with him. That got Williams interested in home computers. She began playing video games, first a text-based adventure game called Colossal Cave. Before long she was hooked on video games‚Äîespecially of the adventure-style genre. = Mystery House = When Williams began developing her first game in the late 1970s, she had no experience with gaming or computers ‚Äì only in reading and storytelling. She did not know how to program computers, but her husband Ken did. Their first creation was Mystery House, an adventure game with black and white graphics for the Apple II computer that was the first computer game to include graphics ‚Äì predecessors had been text-only. To create graphics the Williams used a machine called a Versawriter, which was basically a board of thick plexiglass that had an arm- like device with an electronic eye at the tip. To the Williams' surprise, the game was met with acclaim and they went on to become leading figures in the development of graphical adventure games throughout the 1980s and 1990s. = Sierra On-Line = In 1980, they founded the company On-Line Systems, which later became Sierra On-Line. Her second title, Wizard and the Princess (1980), added color graphics. But their biggest success was the King's Quest series, which featured a large expansive world that could be explored by players. King's Quest I (1984) was the first adventure game to have animation, and King's Quest V (1990) was the first to use an icon-based interface. Williams also designed such titles as Mixed-Up Mother Goose (1987), The Colonel's Bequest (1989), and Phantasmagoria (1995), which was the first in her career to be developed in the full-motion video technology. Phantasmagoria featured extreme violence and rape scenes. The game has received mixed reviews. Though Sierra was sold in 1996, Williams' production credits date to 1999, when she retired from Sierra On-Line. = Recent years = After retiring in 1999 (stated at the time to be a \\"sabbatical\\"), she stayed away from the public eye and rarely gave interviews to talk about her past with Sierra On-Line. However, in a 2006 interview, she admitted that her favorite game she created was Phantasmagoria and not King's Quest: \\"If I could only pick one game, I would pick Phantasmagoria, as I enjoyed working on it immensely and it was so very challenging (and I love to be challenged!). However, in my heart, I will always love the King's Quest series and, especially, King's Quest I, since it was the game that really 'made' Sierra On-Line\\". Williams also said that designing computer games was in the past for her then and that she intended to write a historical novel. In 2011, the video game website Gamezebo reported that Williams had returned from her sabbatical as a design consultant on the social network game Odd Manor. Williams and her husband Ken have a blog about their worldwide cruising adventures on their yacht Nordhavn trawler.Ken's Blog They have another website about their time at Sierra for fans, Sierra Gamers.Sierra Gamers  Legacy  Ars Technica stated that Williams was \\"one of the more iconic figures in adventure gaming\\". GameSpot named her as the number ten in their list of \\"the most influential people in computer gaming of all time\\" for \\"pushing the envelope of graphic adventures\\" and being \\"especially proactive in creating games from a woman's point of view and titles that appealed to the mainstream market, all the while integrating the latest technologies in graphics and sound wherever possible.\\" In 1997, Computer Gaming World ranked her as number 10 on the list of the most influential people of all time in computer gaming for adventure game design.CGW 159: The Most Influential People in Computer Gaming In 2009, IGN placed the Williams at 23rd position on the list of top game creators of all time, expressing hope that \\"maybe one day, we'll see the Williams again as well.\\" Williams can be seen in games and on their covers. She posed for the cover of the game Softporn Adventure by Chuck Benton, published by On-Line Systems. She also posed much later with her children as Mother Goose for the cover photograph of Mixed-Up Mother Goose. The end sequence of Leisure Suit Larry 3 features her as an in-game character. She was also a source of inspiration for the character of Cameron Howe in the AMC television drama Halt and Catch Fire. Williams was given the Pioneer Award at the 20th Game Developers Choice Awards in March 2020 for her work in the graphical adventure game genre and for co-founding Sierra On-line.  Personal life  As a young, timid only child, Williams had a wild imagination. She would make up elaborate stories, which she called her \\"movies\\" and use them to entertain her family. Later on in high school, she met her future husband, Ken Williams, at the age of 17. In Petter Holmberg's biography, he shares the couple's story about how Roberta and Ken met. Holmberg says: \\"She was dating a friend of his and two months after a double date where they had both met, Ken unexpectedly called her and asked her out. Roberta wasn't very impressed with him in the beginning. He was shy and insecure, like her, but also overly pushy at times. He asked her to go steady in the first week. It took some time, but at one point Roberta suddenly realized that he was very intelligent and quite different from the other boys she had dated. Ken wanted them to have a permanent commitment and they got married when Roberta was only 19 years old\\", on November 4, 1972. They have two children: D.J. (born 1973) and Chris (born 1979). The Williams family has homes in Seattle, France, and Mexico, and they spend most of their time traveling on their family-owned yacht.

In technical terms, they are a family of population-based trial and error problem solvers with a metaheuristic or stochastic optimization character. In evolutionary computation, an initial set of candidate solutions is generated and iteratively updated. Each new generation is produced by stochastically removing less desired solutions, and introducing small random changes. In biological terminology, a population of solutions is subjected to natural selection (or artificial selection) and mutation. As a result, the population will gradually evolve to increase in fitness, in this case the chosen fitness function of the algorithm. Evolutionary computation techniques can produce highly optimized solutions in a wide range of problem settings, making them popular in computer science. Many variants and extensions exist, suited to more specific families of problems and data structures. Evolutionary computation is also sometimes used in evolutionary biology as an in silico experimental procedure to study common aspects of general evolutionary processes.  History  The use of evolutionary principles for automated problem solving originated in the 1950s. It was not until the 1960s that three distinct interpretations of this idea started to be developed in three different places. Evolutionary programming was introduced by Lawrence J. Fogel in the US, while John Henry Holland called his method a genetic algorithm. In Germany Ingo Rechenberg and Hans-Paul Schwefel introduced evolution strategies. These areas developed separately for about 15 years. From the early nineties on they are unified as different representatives (\\"dialects\\") of one technology, called evolutionary computing. Also in the early nineties, a fourth stream following the general ideas had emerged ‚Äì genetic programming. Since the 1990s, nature-inspired algorithms are becoming an increasingly significant part of the evolutionary computation. These terminologies denote the field of evolutionary computing and consider evolutionary programming, evolution strategies, genetic algorithms, and genetic programming as sub- areas. Simulations of evolution using evolutionary algorithms and artificial life started with the work of Nils Aall Barricelli in the 1960s, and was extended by Alex Fraser, who published a series of papers on simulation of artificial selection. Artificial evolution became a widely recognised optimisation method as a result of the work of Ingo Rechenberg in the 1960s and early 1970s, who used evolution strategies to solve complex engineering problems. Genetic algorithms in particular became popular through the writing of John Holland. As academic interest grew, dramatic increases in the power of computers allowed practical applications, including the automatic evolution of computer programs. Evolutionary algorithms are now used to solve multi- dimensional problems more efficiently than software produced by human designers, and also to optimise the design of systems.G. C. Onwubolu and B V Babu,  Techniques  Evolutionary computing techniques mostly involve metaheuristic optimization algorithms. Broadly speaking, the field includes: *Ant colony optimization *Artificial immune systems *Artificial life (also see digital organism) *Cultural algorithms *Differential evolution *Dual-phase evolution *Estimation of distribution algorithms *Evolutionary algorithms *Evolutionary programming *Evolution strategy *Gene expression programming *Genetic algorithm *Genetic programming *Grammatical evolution *Learnable evolution model *Learning classifier systems *Memetic algorithms *Neuroevolution *Particle swarm optimization *Self-organization such as self- organizing maps, competitive learning *Swarm intelligence  Evolutionary algorithms  Evolutionary algorithms form a subset of evolutionary computation in that they generally only involve techniques implementing mechanisms inspired by biological evolution such as reproduction, mutation, recombination, natural selection and survival of the fittest. Candidate solutions to the optimization problem play the role of individuals in a population, and the cost function determines the environment within which the solutions \\"live\\" (see also fitness function). Evolution of the population then takes place after the repeated application of the above operators. In this process, there are two main forces that form the basis of evolutionary systems: Recombination mutation and crossover create the necessary diversity and thereby facilitate novelty, while selection acts as a force increasing quality. Many aspects of such an evolutionary process are stochastic. Changed pieces of information due to recombination and mutation are randomly chosen. On the other hand, selection operators can be either deterministic, or stochastic. In the latter case, individuals with a higher fitness have a higher chance to be selected than individuals with a lower fitness, but typically even the weak individuals have a chance to become a parent or to survive.  Evolutionary algorithms and biology  Genetic algorithms deliver methods to model biological systems and systems biology that are linked to the theory of dynamical systems, since they are used to predict the future states of the system. This is just a vivid (but perhaps misleading) way of drawing attention to the orderly, well-controlled and highly structured character of development in biology. However, the use of algorithms and informatics, in particular of computational theory, beyond the analogy to dynamical systems, is also relevant to understand evolution itself. This view has the merit of recognizing that there is no central control of development; organisms develop as a result of local interactions within and between cells. The most promising ideas about program-development parallels seem to us to be ones that point to an apparently close analogy between processes within cells, and the low-level operation of modern computers. Thus, biological systems are like computational machines that process input information to compute next states, such that biological systems are closer to a computation than classical dynamical system. Furthermore, following concepts from computational theory, micro processes in biological organisms are fundamentally incomplete and undecidable (completeness (logic)), implying that ‚Äúthere is more than a crude metaphor behind the analogy between cells and computers. The analogy to computation extends also to the relationship between inheritance systems and biological structure, which is often thought to reveal one of the most pressing problems in explaining the origins of life. Evolutionary automata, a generalization of Evolutionary Turing machines, have been introduced in order to investigate more precisely properties of biological and evolutionary computation. In particular, they allow to obtain new results on expressiveness of evolutionary computation. This confirms the initial result about undecidability of natural evolution and evolutionary algorithms and processes. Evolutionary finite automata, the simplest subclass of Evolutionary automata working in terminal mode can accept arbitrary languages over a given alphabet, including non- recursively enumerable (e.g., diagonalization language) and recursively enumerable but not recursive languages (e.g., language of the universal Turing machine).

Date of celebration The festival was conceived by Governor Evelio Javier, and first celebrated on January 11‚Äì13, 1974. In 1975, the festival was moved to April 25‚Äì27, but in the succeeding years was celebrated in December to coincide with the Christmas celebration in the province. In 1981, with the assumption of Governor Enrique A. Zaldivar, it was moved back to April. The festival was not celebrated in 1980, 1984‚Äì1987, and 1995 due to political crises. Consequently, the dates of the festival, which has become one of the major festivals in the West Visayan region has suffered inconsistency with the every change of leadership of the province. In 2002, however, the provincial board of Antique passed a resolution fixing the date of the celebration in April, and when the management of the festival was given to Binirayan Foundation, Inc. the dates were set on the third weekend of April. In 2011, the date was again changed to December, and ever since, it is being celebrated every December. Purpose The Binirayan Festival commemorates the legend of the arrival of the ten Bornean datus on the island of Aninipay now known as Panay. (See the legend of Maragtas.) As Governor Evelio B. Javier, the Father of Binirayan Festival, reminded the Antique√±os during the earlier celebrations, \\"let us gather the strands and memories of our past, as we look back with pride, that we may look ahead with confidence to Antique tomorrow.\\"Binirayan 77 souvenir program Binirayan Festival's permanent theme is \\"Retracing Roots, Celebrating Culture and Greatness.\\"Binirayan Foundation, Inc. brochure Events The festival opens with a fluvial parade from the Pantalan port to Malandog Beach in Hamtic, believed to be the original settlement of the Bornean datu. In Malandog is a historical marker commemorating this legendary event. There are beauty pageants, cultural shows, street dancing, parades, and arts and crafts local products exhibits. In 2006, the Binirayan Foundation introduced the Komedya Antique√±a as a sub-festival to promote the komedyas traditional folk theater. =From Ati-ati to Malay-ati= The ati-ati, now popularly known as \\"ati-atihan\\" in Philippine fiestas, used to be one of the main events of the festival. Patterned after the famous ati-ati of Aklan, the Binirayan ati-ati is participated in by people of all walks of life painting their faces with black soot. A tribe competition is held among towns and barangays. The popular tribes during the first decade of the festival were Tribu Kamihanon (Bgy 8), Tribu Bukaka (Bgy 2), Tribu Karintukay Dagatnon (Marina) and Tribu Campan (Kampo-Pantalan). Tribu Kaunlaran (Bgy 3) of Comon under then tribe trainer and choreographer Herman Cortez became a regular winner, that they represented the province in 1981 in the Dinagyang Festival in Iloilo City as Tribu Binirayan. Tribu Binirayan emerged Champion, the first-ever non-Ilonggo tribe to win the competition. It also boosted the popularity of Binirayan Festival as a major festival in Region VI. In later years, however, the high cost of maintaining tribes, prevented many tribes join the ati-ati competition. In 2001, the Binirayan Executive Committee repackaged the competition as Malay- Ati competition to introduce the idea that the Malays and Ati are the ancestors of the Antique√±os. Current Malay-Ati performance show historical events, folk practices and lifestyles in Antique. The competition in April 2008 was a best of the best among festivals in the province. =Lin-ay kang Antique= Antique International Marathon This year, 2017, a new event is being slated, the Antique International Marathon (AIM). It aims to showcase the pristine nature and hassle free lifestyle of the Antique√±os. It also intends to put the province at the center of sports tourism in the country. AIM will also spark the enthusiasm of the Antique√±os and everyone else to get into sports, go outdoors and have a healthy lifestyle. Part of the Registration Fee (10.00) will go to the beautification/upkeep of the Malandog River. Malandog River is the site where the Landing of the Ten Malayan Datus took place.http://race.ph/AntiqueMarathon The Binirayan Confab In 2007, Binirayan Foundation convened the Binirayan Confab (initially billed as Binirayan Summit) as a gathering of scholars, academicians, researchers, artists, cultural workers, and almost anyone interested in \\"Antiqueniana.\\" The confab serves as the intellectual strand of the festival, because according to the organizers, to make the Binirayan Festival closer to its vision of bringing together Antique√±os to look at their past with pride, and look ahead with confidence. The Binirayan festival is not all raucous revelry, but also a time to think about which direction the province takes.Binirayan Souvenir program References Category:Festivals in the Philippines Category:Visayan festivals Category:Culture of Antique (province) Category:Tourist attractions in Antique (province) ","title":"Binirayan festival"},{"id":"268034","text":"Title page of volume 1 The Allgemeine Encyclop√§die der Wissenschaften und K√ºnste (\\"Universal Encyclopaedia of Sciences and Arts\\") was a 19th-century German encyclopaedia published by Johann Samuel Ersch and Johann Gottfried Gruber, therefore also known as the \\"Ersch-Gruber.\\" One of the most ambitious encyclopaedia projects ever, it remains uncompleted. It was designed and begun in 1813 by Professor Ersch to satisfy the wants of Germans, only in part supplied by foreign works. It was stopped by the Napoleonic Wars until 1816, when Professor Gottlieb Hufeland joined, but he died on November 25, 1817, while the specimen part was at press. The first volume appeared in Leipzig in 1818. The editors of the different sections at various times were some of the best-known men of learning in Germany, including Gruber, M.H.E. Meier, Hermann Brockhaus, W. M√ºller and A.G. Hoffmann of Jena. Naturalist Eduard Poeppig wrote most of the articles on the Americas. All articles bear the authors' names, and those not ready in time were placed at the end of their letter. The work is divided into three sections: # A-G (99 volumes published, complete) : # H-N (only the first 43 volumes published, through Ligatur) # O-Z (only the first 25 volumes published, through Phyxios) From its beginning through 1830, the Encyclop√§die was published at Leipzig by Johan Friedrich Gleditsch. From 1831 until publication ceased in 1889, the Encyclop√§die was published by Friedrich Arnold Brockhaus, also of Leipzig. Gleditsch published volumes 1 through 21 of the first section; volumes 1 through 7 of the second, but only the first volume of the third section. Brockhaus published the remaining volumes through 1889. By 1889, when the project was abandoned, the Encyclop√§die had reached 167 volumes. The article about Greece alone covered 3,668 pages, spanning eight volumes.

At approximately , it is the largest lake in Finland, and the fourth largest natural freshwater lake in Europe. History It was formed by glacial melting at the end of the Ice Age. Major towns on the lakeshore include Lappeenranta, Imatra, Savonlinna, Mikkeli, Varkaus, and Joensuu. About 6000 years ago, ancient Lake Saimaa, estimated to cover nearly at the time, was abruptly discharged through a new outlet. The event created thousands of square kilometres of new residual wetlands.Markku Oinonen et al. (2014) Event reconstruction through Bayesian chronology: Massive mid-Holocene lake-burst triggered large-scale ecological and cultural change; url=http://hol.sagepub.com/content/24/11/1419.abstract Following this event, the region saw a population maximum in the decades following only to later return to an ecological development towards old boreal conifer forests which saw a decline in population. Topography The Vuoksi River flows from Saimaa to Lake Ladoga. Most of the lake is spotted with islands, and narrow canals divide the lake in many parts, each having their own names (major basins include Suur-Saimaa, Orivesi, Puruvesi, Haukivesi, Y√∂vesi, Pihlajavesi, and Pyh√§selk√§). Thus, Saimaa exhibits all major types of lake in Finland at different levels of eutrophication.Making of J√§rven tarina.

An endangered freshwater seal, the Saimaa Ringed Seal, lives only at Saimaa. Another of the lake's endangered species is the Saimaa salmon. Due to its rich, easily accessible asbestos deposits, the shores of the lake are the most probable origin of asbestos-ceramic, a type of pottery made between c. 1900 BC ‚Äì 200 AD. The areas around Saimaa lake are very popular location for summer cabins as well as lake cruises. Saimaa canal The Saimaa Canal from Lauritsala, Lappeenranta to Vyborg connects Saimaa to the Gulf of Finland. Other canals connect Saimaa to smaller lakes in Eastern Finland and form a network of waterways. These waterways are mainly used to transport wood, minerals, metals, pulp and other cargo, but tourists also use the waterways.

It was established in 1817 by King William I of the Netherlands. After the Belgian revolution of 1830, the newly formed Belgian state began to administer the university. In 1930, the university became the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium, whereas French had previously been the standard academic language in what was Universit√© de Gand. In 1991, it was granted major autonomy and changed its name accordingly from State University of Ghent (, abbreviated as RUG) to its current designation. In contrast to the Catholic University of Leuven or the Free University of Brussels, UGent considers itself a pluralist university in a special sense, i.e. not connected to any particular religion or political ideology. Its motto Inter Utrumque ('In Between Both Extremes'), on the coat of arms, suggests the acquisition of wisdom and science comes only in an atmosphere of peace, when the institution is fully supported by the monarchy and fatherland. Ghent University is one of the biggest Flemish universities, consisting of 44,000 students and 9,000 staff members. The University also supports the University Library and the University Hospital, which is one of the largest hospitals in Belgium. It is one of the greatest beneficiaries of funding from the Research Foundation - Flanders (FWO). Ghent University consistently rates among the top 100 universities in the world .  History  = Foundation, in the 19th century = Painting of the establishment of the State University of Ghent in 1817 when the city was under Dutch ruleThe university in Ghent was opened on October 9, 1817, with JC van Rotterdam serving as the first rector. In the first year, it had 190 students and 16 professors. The original four faculties consisted of Humanities (Letters), Law, Medicine and Science, and the language of instruction was Latin. The university was founded by King William I as part of a policy to stem the intellectual and academic lag in the southern part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, later to become Belgium. After peaking at a student population of 414, the number of students declined quickly following the Belgian Revolution. At this time, the Faculties of Humanities and Science were broken from the university, but they were restored five years later, in 1835. Ghent University played a role in the foundation of modern organic chemistry. Friedrich August Kekul√© (7 September 1829 ‚Äì 13 July 1896) unraveled the structure of benzene at Ghent and Adolf von Baeyer (Johann Friedrich Wilhelm Adolf von Baeyer), a student of August Kekul√©, made contributions to organic chemistry. In 1882, Sidonie Verhelst became the first female student at the university. French became the language of instruction, taking the place of Latin, after the 1830 Revolution. In 1903, the Flemish politician Lodewijk De Raet led a successful campaign to begin instruction in Dutch, and the first courses were begun in 1906. left = Developments since the 20th century = Universiteitsforum 2010PM 0603 21H7975 During World War I, the occupying German administration conducted Flamenpolitik and turned Ghent University into the first Dutch-speaking university in Belgium. A Flemish Institute (Vlaemsche Hoogeschool), commonly known as Von Bissing University, was founded in 1916 but was disestablished after the war and French language was fully reinstated. In 1923, Cabinet Minister Pierre Nolf put forward a motion to definitively establish the university as a Dutch- speaking university, and this was realized in 1930. August Vermeylen served as the first rector of a Dutch-language university in Belgium.A Language Come Back, TIME Magazine, April 28, 1923 In the Second World War, the German administration of the university attempted to create a German orientation, removing faculty members and installing loyal activists. After the war, the university became a much larger institution, following government policy of democratizing higher education in Flanders during the 1950s and 1960s. By 1953, there were more than 3,000 students, and by 1969 more than 11,500. The number of faculties increased to eleven, starting with Applied Sciences in 1957. It was followed by Economics and Veterinary Medicine in 1968, Psychology and Pedagogy, as well as Bioengineering, in 1969, and Pharmaceutical Sciences. The faculty of Politics and Social Sciences is the most recent addition, in 1992. In the 1960s to 1980s, there were several student demonstrations at Ghent University, notably around the Blandijn site, which houses the Faculty of Arts & Philosophy. The severest demonstrations took place in 1969 in the wake of May 1968. In 1991, the university officially changed its name from Rijksuniversiteit Gent (RUG) to Universiteit Gent (UGent), following an increased grant of autonomy by the government of the Flemish Community.

It is a tributary of the River Dove.  Etymology  The origins of the name \\"Churnet\\" are unknown, though it is thought to derive from the pre-English, British name for the river.  Course  The source of the river is located over above sea level in the Staffordshire moorlands, near the gritstone escarpment of the Roaches, and next to the A53 Leek to Buxton road, It is only a few hundred yards away from Black Brook which ultimately, through the Dane and Weaver, flows into the Irish Sea; however, the Churnet, through the Dove, Trent and Humber Estuary, ultimately flows into the North Sea. After flowing downhill for a few miles it reaches Tittesworth Reservoir, a major supplier of fresh water to the Potteries and Leek. After it leaves the dam at Tittesworth, it flows into the ancient market town of Leek, where it was used until quite recently to aid the manufacture of dyes that were used in the town's textile and silk industries. South of Cheddleton, the river flows through the Churnet Valley, an area of outstanding beauty with ancient woodland, an abundance of wildlife and industrial heritage. The Caldon Canal locks into the river at Oak Meadow Ford Lock, 2 miles on from Cheddleton and river and canal are one until Consall Forge, where the canal goes its own way again. The river continues through the valley, past ancient woodland and the Bolton Copper works at Froghall, then through the villages of Oakamoor and Alton. It flows past the JCB factory at Rocester and shortly afterwards joins the River Dove near the hamlet of Combridge.  Churnet Valley  The course of the river from Cheddleton to Rocester runs through the Churnet Valley ‚Äì a part of Staffordshire that has been known either as Staffordshire's Rhineland or Staffordshire's Little Switzerland. Throughout the valley there are steep gorges and banks, with an abundance of woodland and Wildlife. There are several woods owned by the National Trust and the RSPB.  Industry  The Churnet has been heavily influenced by industry along its length for nearly a thousand years and as a result became possibly the most polluted river in Europe. The river was heavily used in Leek by the textile industry to make dyes. The dyeing industry was established in 1734 and it was claimed that the water from the Churnet was the finest in Europe for this purpose. In nearby Cheddleton the Churnet was used to power a flint mill that ground down flint for use in the pottery industry. Further downriver at Froghall and at Oakamoor the Thomas Bolton Copper works used the power of the Churnet to help manufacture the world's first transatlantic telegraph cables. The processes involved in manufacturing copper wire at the sites caused high levels of pollution. The Churnet Valley was heavily involved in the iron-smelting industry and it is documented from as long ago as 1290 that iron was smelted using the river as its main source of energy. The early forges were at East Wall, near Oakamoor, but a later forge is still standing at Consall, next to the locks on the Caldon Canal. The Caldon Canal runs with the river through the Churnet Valley and along parts the river is canalised. There was intensive freight traffic on the waterway transporting limestone and ironstone from the wharves on the canal. Today the only industrial use of the river is by the sand quarry at Oakamoor. Since the decline of industry in Leek and the Churnet Valley, the quality of the water has improved so much that a programme of re-introducing salmon is underway.

The primary objective of the AAS is to promote the advancement of astronomy and closely related branches of science, while the secondary purpose includes enhancing astronomy education and providing a political voice for its members through lobbying and grassroots activities. Its current mission is to enhance and share humanity's scientific understanding of the universe.  History  The society was founded in 1899 through the efforts of George Ellery Hale. The constitution of the group was written by Hale, George Comstock, Edward Morley, Simon Newcomb and Edward Charles Pickering. These men plus four others were the first Executive Council of the society, Newcomb was the first president. The initial membership was 114. The AAS name of the society was not finally decided until 1915, previously it was the \\"Astronomical and Astrophysical Society of America\\". One proposed name that preceded this interim name was \\"American Astrophysical Society\\". The AAS today has over 7,000 members and six divisions ‚Äì the Division for Planetary Sciences (1968), the Division on Dynamical Astronomy (1969), the High Energy Astrophysics Division (1969), the Solar Physics Division (1969), the Historical Astronomy Division (1980) and the Laboratory Astrophysics Division (2012). The membership includes physicists, mathematicians, geologists, engineers and others whose research interests lie within the broad spectrum of subjects now comprising contemporary astronomy. In 2019 three AAS members were selected into the tenth anniversary class of TED Fellows.https://aas.org/posts/news/2019/01/2019-class-ted-fellows- includes-three-aas-members The AAS established the AAS Fellows program in 2019 to \\"confer recognition upon AAS members for achievement and extraordinary service to the field of astronomy and the American Astronomical Society.\\" The inaugural class was designated by the AAS Board of Trustees and includes an initial group of 232 Legacy Fellows.  Divisions  Because the field of astronomy is diverse, several divisions have been formed each of which promotes and enables a different branch of astronomy or astronomy-related science as well as working within the overall charter of the AAS. Many of the divisions hold separate meetings in addition to meeting with the main group. The divisions of the AAS, together with their main research interests, are: * The Division for Planetary Sciences (DPS) supports planetology and exploration of the Solar System. * The Division on Dynamical Astronomy (DDA) supports research on the dynamics (orbits, evolution, and history) of astronomical systems from the Solar System to superclusters of galaxies on cosmological scales. * The High Energy Astrophysics Division (HEAD) supports knowledge about high energy events, particles, quanta, relativistic gravitational fields, and related phenomena in the astrophysical universe. * The Historical Astronomy Division (HAD) supports topics relevant to the history of astronomy as a field, and research using historical astronomical records to solve current problems in astronomy. * The Solar Physics Division (SPD) supports solar physics (astrophysical research on the Sun), and its interactions with the Solar System and Earth. * In 2012, a new division was formed: the Laboratory Astrophysics Division (LAD) to advance humanity's understanding of the Universe through the promotion of fundamental theoretical and experimental research into the underlying processes that drive the Universe.

Tioman Island () is a mukim and an island in Rompin District, Pahang, Malaysia. It is located off the east coast of the state, and is some long and wide. It has seven villages, the largest and most populous being Kampung Tekek on the central western coast. The densely forested island is sparsely inhabited, and is surrounded by numerous coral reefs, making it a popular scuba diving, snorkelling, and surfing spot. There are many resorts and chalets for tourists around the island, which has duty- free status. In the 1970s, TIME Magazine selected Tioman as one of the world's most beautiful islands. The island is part of Pahang territory, although it is geographically closer to mainland Johor than to mainland Pahang, and is accessed via ferry service from the Johorean coastal town of Mersing. Within Tioman Island there are four kampungs: Salang, Tekek, Juara and Air Batang. The telephone numbers in Tioman start with 09-413, 09-419, 09-582, 09-583 and 09-584. History \\"Paulo Tymon\\", Nieuhof: Ambassade vers la Chine, 1665. Tioman has been used for thousands of years by fishermen as an important navigation point and a source of fresh water and wood. During the past thousand years, it has played host to Chinese, Arab, and European trading ships, and often Chinese porcelain shards can be found on beaches around the island. In more recent history, Tioman played host to both the British and the Japanese navies during the Second World War, and the waters around the island are littered with war remains (including HMS Repulse and HMS Prince of Wales). Tioman island does not allow buildings to have more than 3 stories. Nature The marine area around Tioman Island and eight other nearby islands have been declared as marine parks and marine reserves. Apart from its diverse marine life, the inland rainforest area was protected in 1972 as the Pulau Tioman Wildlife Reserve. However, a large part of the original reserve was sacrificed for agricultural and touristic development in 1984; the remaining area is approximately . There are several protected species of mammals on the island, including the binturong, long-tailed macaque, slow loris, black giant squirrel, red giant flying squirrel, mouse deer, brush-tailed porcupine, and common palm civet, from a total of 45 species of mammals and 138 species of birds, including the majestic frigatebird. Moreover, Tioman has species that are endemic to its shores. The Tioman walking catfish Clarias batu can be seen on rainforest walks. Kajang slender litter frog is only known from Mount Kajang. Tioman's corals have been affected by a mass bleaching event in 2010 whereby the island lost a significant portion of its live coral cover.

Cata Ferry - cataferry.com Legend A picture of a wooden tomb with Tioman Island's legend written on it. According to legend, Tioman Island is the resting place of a beautiful dragon princess. Whilst flying to visit her prince in Singapore, this beautiful maiden stopped to seek solace in the crystal-clear waters of the South China Sea. Enraptured by the charms of the place, she decided to discontinue her journey. By taking the form of an island, she pledged to offer shelter and comfort to passing travelers. Local mythology claims that the island is the embodiment of the mighty dragon Sri Gumom. The dragon was on his way to visit his sister Gunung Linga (Lingin Peak) but the great Sri Rama forbade the meeting and Sri Gumom was turned into a stone and fell into the deep sea where he now remains, frozen in eternity as this beautiful island with its distinctive topography.

The distance from the municipal centre to central Helsinki is some . Kirkkonummi also has excellent train and bus connections to other parts of the Greater Helsinki area, and many of its inhabitants commute daily to Helsinki. The municipality covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Over the recent years, Kirkkonummi has faced the highest population growth rate in the country, over 3% per annum. Major population centres in Kirkkonummi include the municipal centre, Masala, Veikkola, Kantvik and the Upinniemi naval garrison area. In addition to these, there are dozens of smaller villages. Geographically, Kirkkonummi has two famous peninsulas, namely Porkkala and Upinniemi, the latter one of which houses a major Finnish naval base. Porkkala is also on one of the main bird migration routes in the Baltic Sea region. Additionally, Kirkkonummi has a large central plains area, through which a railway goes from Helsinki to Turku as well as extensive lake areas, much of which is relatively untouched wilderness. Kirkkonummi has been populated from the Stone Age to the present day as evidenced by the first Stone Age rock paintings found in Finland that are located by lake Vittr√§sk in the central lake region of Kirkkonummi. Incidentally, these paintings were found by the famous Finnish composer Jean Sibelius himself. The southern half of the municipality was leased to the Soviet Union between 1945 and 1956 for use as a naval base as part of the peace settlement that ended the hostilities between the Soviet Union and Finland during World War II. Signs of this time include concrete bunkers, other fortifications and the remains of an airbase. Other places of interest located in Kirkkonummi include the medieval stone church in the municipal centre, the wooden church in the village of Haapaj√§rvi as well as the Hvittr√§sk manor designed by Finnish architects Eliel Saarinen, Herman Gesellius and Armas Lindgren.

The peninsula had great strategic value, as coastal artillery based there would be able to shoot more than halfway across the Gulf of Finland. If the same power controlled the Estonian coast, on the opposite side of the gulf, it would then be able to block Saint Petersburg's naval access to the Baltic Sea. The distance to Estonia at the closest point is only . Porkkala is furthermore located only from Helsinki, the Finnish capital, and a foreign power based there would be able to exert significant pressure on the Finnish government. Nowadays, the coasts of the peninsula are popular bird- watching areas during the Arctic geese and other waterfowls' spring migration.  History  At the end of the Second World War, the Soviet Union secured the rights of lease to a naval base at Porkkala, in accordance with the Moscow armistice agreement that ended the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviets on 19 September 1944. Porkkala thus replaced the peninsula of Hanko, which had been leased to the Soviets as a naval base in 1940‚Äì41. A large area centered on the peninsula, including land from the municipalities of Kirkkonummi, Siuntio and Ing√• and almost the entire area of Degerby, was leased to the USSR from 29 September 1944, ten days after the armistice. It was immediately placed under a military commander, Neon Vasilyevich Antonov (1907‚Äì1948), who remained in office till June 1945, when he was transferred to command the Amur River flotilla, in preparation for the war against Japan.–ê–Ω—Ç–æ–Ω–æ–≤ –ù–µ–æ–Ω –í–∞—Å–∏–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á According to the armistice of 1944, the area was leased to the Soviet Union for 50 years. On 10 February 1947, the Paris peace treaty reaffirmed the Soviet Union's right to occupy the area until 1994. No Soviet civilian administration was set up; the Soviet Union simply administered it through the military commander of Porkkala, a post held until 26 January 1956 by Sergey Ivanovich Kabanov (1901‚Äì1973), the former Commander of Hanko naval base. While under Soviet control, Finnish passenger trains running between Helsinki and Turku were allowed to use the railway through the area. However, all train windows had to be closed with shutters, and photography was prohibited.The iron curtain comes down, and \\"the world's longest railway tunnel\\" is created (HELSINGIN SANOMAT) During the 1952 Summer Olympics in Helsinki, the Soviet Olympic team was housed on the base rather than in the Olympic village. Although the Soviet lease for Porkkala had been conceded for 50 years, an agreement was reached to return it earlier. The agreement was signed on 19 September 1955, exactly 11 years after the armistice, and control of the area reverted to Finland on 26 January 1956. This may be attributed to the process of Finlandization and to technological progress making coastal artillery obsolete, but the renunciation of Stalinism by the Soviet Union under Nikita Khrushchev and Finland's neutrality and remaining out of NATO were also important contributing factors. Currently, the Porkkala area houses one of the main bases of the Finnish Navy, located in Upinniemi, near Porkkala proper.  In popular culture  The Soviet lease of Porkkala and the return of the area to former inhabitants are key events in the Finnish Noir mystery, Below the Surface by Leena Lehtolainen.

The Governing Body, along with other \\"helpers\\", are organized into six committees responsible for various administrative functions within the global Witness community, including publication, assembly programs and evangelizing activity. The Governing Body and its committees supervise operations of nearly one hundred branch offices worldwide. Each branch office oversees the activities of Jehovah's Witnesses in a particular country or region, and may include facilities for the publication and distribution of Watch Tower Society literature. Directly appointed by the Governing Body, branch committees supervise administrative functions for congregations in their jurisdiction. Congregations are further organized into circuits of about twenty congregations each. The Governing Body directly appoints circuit overseers as its representatives to supervise activities within circuits. Headquarters representatives visit groups of branch offices to provide instruction and report the branch's activities to the Governing Body. Each congregation is served by a group of locally recommended male elders and ministerial servants, appointed by the circuit overseer. Elders take responsibility for congregational governance, pastoral work, setting meeting times, selecting speakers, conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work, and forming judicial committees to investigate and decide disciplinary action in cases where members are believed to have committed serious sins. Ministerial servants fulfil clerical and attendant duties, but may also teach and conduct meetings. Governing Body The organization is directed by the Governing Body--an all-male group that varies in size, but since January 2018 has had eight members,--based in the Watchtower Society's Warwick, New York headquarters. Each of the Governing Body members claims to be of the \\"anointed class\\" with a hope of heavenly life (whereas most Jehovah's Witnesses hope to be resurrected in an earthly paradise). There are no elections for membership; new members are selected by the existing body. Each of its members serves as chairman, with the position rotating among members alphabetically each year. Until late 2012, the Governing Body described itself as the representative and \\"spokesman\\" of God's \\"faithful and discreet slave class\\" (approximately 11,000 Jehovah's Witnesses who in 2010 professed to be \\"anointed\\"), providing \\"spiritual food\\" for Witnesses worldwide on behalf of the \\"faithful and discreet slave class\\". In practice it sought neither advice nor approval from other \\"anointed\\" Witnesses when formulating policies and doctrines, or when producing material for publications and conventions. At the 2012 Annual Meeting of the Watch Tower Society, the \\"faithful and discreet slave\\" was re- defined as referring to the Governing Body only. From 1944, Watch Tower publications had made occasional references to a governing body,The Watchtower, November 1, 1944, as cited by Raymond Franz, Crisis of Conscience, p.74 footnote. identifying it with the board of directors of the Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania. In October 1971, four additional men joined the seven members of the Society's board of directors on what became known as a separate, expanded Governing Body. The Governing Body was then for the first time formally defined, indicating that it provided Jehovah's Witnesses with direction, guidance and regulation, Article discusses formal definition of Governing Body, and makes first use of capitalized term. although all doctrinal and publishing decisions continued to be made by, or were subject to, the approval of the Society's president. Organizational changes at the highest levels of the Watchtower Society in 1976 significantly increased the powers and authority of the Governing Body and reduced those of the Watch Tower Society president. The Governing Body directs six committees comprising its members along with its \\"helpers\\"; the six committees are responsible for various administrative functions including personnel, publishing, evangelizing activity, school and assembly programs, writing, and coordination. The Governing Body directly appoints all headquarters representatives, circuit overseers, collectively referred to as \\"traveling overseers\\", and also appoints branch office committee members. Only branch committee members and traveling overseers are referred to as \\"representatives of the Governing Body\\". In the last decade, the Governing Body has reiterated its overall oversight role but has delegated other Witnesses, typically branch committee members, to serve as corporate executives and directors of Watch Tower and other incorporated entities. Branch offices Jehovah's Witnesses operate 87 branch offices worldwide, under the oversight of headquarters representatives who visit each of their assigned branches every few years, auditing operations, counseling branch committee members, department heads and missionaries, and reporting back to the Governing Body.1978 Yearbook of Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses p. 20\\"Declaring the Good News Without Letup\\", Jehovah's Witnesses - Proclaimers of God's Kingdom, page 101. Each branch office is referred to as Bethel. The United States branch office, spread across three New York State locations with a staff of more than 5000, also serves as the international headquarters. Branch offices, operated by Witness volunteers known as Bethel families, produce and distribute Bible-based literature and communicate with congregations within their jurisdiction.Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses‚ÄîUnitedly Doing God‚Äôs Will Worldwide, p. 25-27 Full-time staff at branch offices take a vow of poverty and are members of a religious order. Each branch is overseen by a committee of three or more elders, which is appointed by the Governing Body. A Service Department in each branch corresponds with congregations and supervises the work of traveling overseers. Branch offices may also have departments responsible for printing, translation and legal representation.

All traveling overseers are directly appointed by the Governing Body.African American Religious Cultures: A-R by Stephen C. Finley, Torin Alexander, Greenwood Publishing, ABC-CLIO, 2009, page 201 A branch may appoint qualified local elders as \\"substitute\\" circuit overseers. Additional training is provided at their School for Traveling Overseers, and ongoing pastoral care and instruction is provided to them by senior branch office representatives. In 1995, Witnesses reported that 4374 traveling overseers cared for 78,620 congregations, an average of about 18 congregations each. The majority of traveling overseers are circuit overseers; they oversee circuits of about twenty congregations, performing twice-yearly week-long visits with each. During his visit, the circuit overseer delivers talks to the congregation and meets with the elders, ministerial servants and pioneers. He is responsible for appointing new elders and ministerial servants, based on recommendations by elders. He typically works with various members of the congregation in the house-to-house preaching work, and may also conduct personal Bible studies and pastoral calls. Jehovah's Witnesses are instructed to \\"participate in a joyful interchange of encouragement\\" with traveling overseers, and to render them \\"double honor\\", a biblical term(1 Timothy 5:17-18, NWT) \\"Let the older men who preside in a fine way be reckoned worthy of double honor, especially those who work hard in speaking and teaching. 18 For the scripture says: ‚ÄúYou must not muzzle a bull when it threshes out the grain‚Äù\\". they believe includes cooperation and hospitality. Traveling overseers are generally members of a religious order who have taken a vow of poverty; they are provided with vehicles, healthcare, and lodging, and their basic expenses are reimbursed by the congregations they visit.\\"Traveling Overseers‚ÄîFellow Workers in the Truth\\", Doing God's Will, ¬©1986 Watch Tower, page 21 Congregations Congregations are usually based on geographical area or language spoken, and may have as few as ten or as many as two hundred members.Jehovah's Witnesses in the Twentieth Century, page 25It is recommended but not required that members attend the congregation of the territory in which they reside. See Congregations meet for religious services at Kingdom Halls, which may be shared by two or more congregations. If a small group of Witnesses is isolated by geography or language, it may have some or all of its meetings at a different time and place to the rest of the congregation, under the supervision of that congregation's body of elders. If a group intends to become a new congregation, the area's circuit overseer submits an application to the branch office.\\"Methods of Preaching the Good News\\", Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, ¬©2005 Watch Tower, page 106-107 Each congregation is assigned a territory; members are requested to attend the congregation of the territory in which they reside. Members also meet in smaller \\"field service groups\\", often at private homes, prior to engaging in organized door-to-door preaching. Each field service group has an appointed \\"group overseer\\" (an elder) or \\"group servant\\" (a ministerial servant). Witnesses are instructed to devote as much time as possible to preaching activities (\\"witnessing\\" or \\"field service\\"), and to provide a monthly report to their congregation summarizing their preaching activity. Jehovah's Witnesses consider all baptized Witnesses to be ministers. Participants in organized preaching activity are referred to as publishers. Only individuals who are approved and active as publishers are officially counted as members. Congregations are governed by local elders, who are assisted by ministerial servants. Elders and ministerial servants are appointed in each congregation for handling various religious and administrative duties. Only male members may serve in the capacity of elder or ministerial servant. In smaller congregations, one man may handle multiple positions until another qualified candidate is available. Baptized female members may perform some of their duties only if a baptized male is unavailable; female Witnesses leading in prayer or teaching are required to wear a head covering. =Elders= Each congregation has a body of elders, who are responsible for congregational governance, pastoral work, selecting speakers and conducting meetings, directing the public preaching work and creating \\"judicial committees\\" to investigate and decide disciplinary action for cases that are seen to breach scriptural laws. There are no secular educational requirements for elders; however, training programs are offered for elders within the organization. Elders are considered \\"overseers\\" based on the biblical Greek term, ·ºêœÄŒØœÉŒ∫ŒøœÄŒøœÇ (episkopos, typically translated \\"bishop\\"). Prospective elders are recommended from among ministerial servants and former elders by the local elder body for appointment by the circuit overseer. Particular roles within the body of elders include: *Coordinator of the Body of Elders: chairs elders' meetings, assigns duties and speakers for most congregation meetings, and cares for certain financial matters. *Service Overseer: organizes matters related to public preaching, and oversees those handling Witness literature and territories. *Congregation Secretary: maintains congregation records, reports congregation activity to the branch office, advises the congregation about conventions and assemblies, and oversees those handling accounts. *Watchtower Study Conductor: leads the weekly study of The Watchtower. *Operating Committee Members: responsible for the care of the building and property of Kingdom Halls that are shared by two or more congregations. *Group Overseers: oversees groups for public preaching and pastoral care. *Public Talk Coordinator: schedules speakers and talks for public meetings and co-ordinates traveling speakers from his congregation. =Ministerial servants= Ministerial servants, equivalent to deacons, are appointed to assist the elders with routine work, including the supply of literature to the congregation, accounts, maintaining the Kingdom Hall, and operating audiovisual equipment. They also present various parts at the meetings. Ministerial servants are appointed in a similar manner to elders. The following roles are normally filled by ministerial servants: *Accounts Servant: collects donations from contribution boxes after each meeting, deposits moneys, pays bills. *Sound Servant: coordinates and schedules others to run microphones, handle the stage and podium and operate audio equipment; in large congregations, a separate Platform Servant may also be assigned. *Literature Servant: distributes literature in stock, takes requests for special items, or yearly items for use by congregation members. May place special request orders for publishers in their own Kingdom Hall. *Literature Coordinator: orders and receives stock and bulk literature for multiple congregations meeting at a single Kingdom Hall. *Magazine Servant: arranges orders of study, simplified, foreign language, and non-print editions of The Watchtower and Awake! magazines. *Magazine Coordinator: orders and receives all magazines for congregations meeting at a single Kingdom Hall, and stocks them in a designated magazine pickup area. *Territory Servant: distributes territory maps for preaching and keeps records of all territories within the local congregation's area. *Attendant Servant: greets visitors, seats latecomers, takes attendance count, and is responsible for climate control of the Kingdom Hall and parking lot security. *Group Servant: assumes role of Group Overseer when a sufficient number of elders is not available, under supervision of the body of elders. =Baptized publishers= Baptized publishers are members who have been publicly baptized following conversion to the faith. Jehovah's Witnesses do not practice infant baptism, and previous baptisms performed by other denominations are not considered valid. Prior to baptism, they are required to respond to a series of questions to assess their suitability, and to make a personal dedication to serve God. Baptisms are typically performed at assemblies and conventions. From the moment of baptism, the organization officially considers the person to be a member of Jehovah's Witnesses, and an ordained minister. Regular publishers do not have a specific quota of hours for preaching each month, but publishers are requested to \\"set goals such as reaching [the] national average of hours for publishers\\". Publishers are typically required to report at least one hour per month to be counted as a 'regular publisher'. Generally, only whole hours are reported and partial hours are carried over to the next month, though publishers limited by advanced age or serious health conditions may be allowed to report fifteen- minute increments. Publishers who fail to report for one month are termed \\"irregular\\" and those who do not report for six consecutive months are called \\"inactive\\". The terms irregular and inactive are used to identify members in need of 'spiritual assistance' from congregation elders; those who are habitually 'irregular' or 'inactive' are usually restricted from serving in any special capacity. Yearly reports of congregation activity are compiled and published by the Watch Tower Society. Baptized publishers considered to be exemplary may serve in various special preaching capacities: *': make a commitment of thirty or fifty hours of preaching activities for a given month. This can be performed on a per month or ongoing basis. *': make a commitment of an average of seventy hours of preaching activity each month, totaling 840 hours for the year. For congregation elders to recommend appointment of a regular pioneer, a publisher must be baptized for at least six months and be considered an exemplary member of the congregation. Members who have been reproved or reinstated in the last year may not serve as regular pioneers. *': assigned by a branch to perform special activity, such as preaching in remote areas, which may require at least 130 hours per month. Special pioneers receive a stipend for basic living expenses. *': sent to foreign countries to preach. They spend at least 130 hours per month in preaching. Before assignment to a location, missionaries may receive training at Gilead School. Missionaries receive a stipend for basic living expenses. Children When accompanied by adults, children of baptized Witnesses may participate in organized preaching without formally qualifying. However, only those recognized as publishers are counted in the denomination's official membership statistics. Children of Witness parents may be asked to participate in demonstrations at congregation meetings and assemblies, or as models and actors in materials published by the Watch Tower Society.\\"Meetings that Incite to Love and Fine Works\\", Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, ¬©2005 Watch Tower, page 66 =Unbaptized publishers= Unbaptized publishers are persons who are not yet baptized, but who have requested and been granted approval to join in the congregation's formal ministry. They must demonstrate a basic knowledge of Jehovah's Witnesses' doctrines to the elders, state their desire to be a Jehovah's Witness, and conform to the organization's moral standards. To qualify as an unbaptized publisher, an individual must already be \\"an active associate of Jehovah's Witnesses\\", regularly attending congregation meetings.\\"Ministers of the Good News\\", Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, ¬©2005 Watch Tower, page 81 Prior to 1988, unbaptized publishers were referred to as \\"approved associates\\", \\"unbaptized associates\\" or \\"regularly associating\\".\\"Subheading: Approved Associates\\", Organized to Accomplish Our Ministry, ¬©1983 Watch Tower, pages 97-100 The terms were discontinued on the basis that meeting attendance on its own does not constitute approval of or commitment to the faith. =Students= The term Bible student, sometimes informally referred to as a \\"Bible study\\", is generally used by Witnesses to refer to an individual who takes part in their religious study program. The purpose of the Bible study program is for the student to become baptized as a Jehovah's Witness. Students usually have their study with the same Witness for the duration of the study program, often being the member who first encounters them while preaching. Interested individuals initially contacted by a member of the opposite sex are typically assigned a study conductor of their own gender. A student typically meets with his or her study conductor once each week at the student's home or other suitable location. The study program involves consideration of a Bible-based publication that addresses Jehovah's Witnesses' core beliefs. Each paragraph is read aloud by the conductor or student, and the student answers pre-printed questions from the material in the paragraph. Students are encouraged to look up cited scriptures in the Bible and include them in their responses. Each Bible study is typically conducted with an individual or family, though in some cases many people may take part. Students are invited to attend and even comment at congregation meetings. Students may also attend reading-improvement or literacy classes in congregations where these additional courses are held.\\"Chapter 7 Meetings that 'Incite to Love and Fine Works'\\", Organized to Do Jehovah's Will, ¬©2005 Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, subheading \\"Theocratic Ministry School\\", page 68\\"Guidelines for School Overseers\\", Benefit From Theocratic Ministry School Education, ¬©2002 Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, page 282 =Associates= Individuals who attend meetings of Jehovah's Witnesses but are not involved in preaching are occasionally referred to in Watch Tower Society publications as \\"associates\\" or as being \\"associated with the congregation\\".

Until 1974, this was primarily the historic county of Yorkshire and parts of neighbouring counties served by the Emley Moor and Bilsdale transmitting station transmitters. Following a re-organisation in 1974 the transmission area was extended to include Lincolnshire, northwestern Norfolk and parts of Derbyshire and Nottinghamshire, served by the Belmont transmitter, but lost much of North Yorkshire served by the Bilsdale transmitter which covered Tyne Tees Television, with transmissions available as far south as Harrogate. Two consortia applied for the franchise, Telefusion Yorkshire Ltd and Yorkshire Independent Television, the former having large financial backing (supported by the Blackpool-based Telefusion television rental chain) and the latter having the better plans but fewer resources. On 1 January 2007, the company transferred its programme production business to ITV Studios Limited. As a consequence, Yorkshire Television Limited ceased to trade on 1 January 2007.Directors Report and Financial Statements, Yorkshire Television Limited, Year Ending 31 December 2006 Yorkshire Television Ltd still legally exists, but its licence is now owned and operated by ITV plc under the licence name of ITV Broadcasting Limited (along with all the other ITV plc-owned franchises). Yorkshire Television Ltd is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed with Companies House as a dormant company.  History  ITV Yorkshire, previously known as Yorkshire Television, and sometimes abbreviated to YTV or Yorkshire, has its origins in the 1967 franchise round. That round stipulated that the influential pan-North region, the licence which was owned by Granada Television and ABC, both based in Manchester, had to be split up. Consequently, it was decided that Granada would keep the North West franchise and a new franchise created for Yorkshire. On 28 February 1967, national and regional newspapers carried numerous advertisements from the Independent Television Authority, each requesting applicants for various new ITV contracts, one of which was Programme Contractor for Yorkshire Area (Contract D) ‚Äì All Week. Ten formal bids were received by the closing date; another less-serious bid, Diddy TV, headed by comedian Ken Dodd withdrew their application. ITV: who wants what. The Times, Tuesday, 30 May 1967 Telefusion Yorkshire Limited, created by the Blackpool-based TV rental chain Telefusion and led by Grampian TV Managing Director G E Ward Thomas, was selected as the winning bid. It was chosen on the condition that it 'merged' with another applicant Yorkshire Independent Television. The latter, backed by a consortium of Yorkshire Post Newspapers Ltd, other local newspaper groups such as the Huddersfield Examiner and the Scarborough Evening News, several Yorkshire- based Co-operative societies, trade unions and local universities, was deemed by the Authority to have the better talent but suffered a lack of funding, whereas Telefusion had the backing of a cash-rich parent. The new venture initially chose the name Yorkshire Television Network but decided to drop the word 'Network' before going on air.New men in television. The Times, Tuesday, 13 June 1967; p. 3 A few days after winning, the chairman Sir Richard Graham said: \\"We see ourselves as having a particular responsibility to convey to a mature audience the particular qualities and strengths of one of the most populous and most important areas outside London.\\"Presenting Yorkshire to Britain. FROM OUR NORTHERN CORRESPONDENT. The Times, Friday, 16 June 1967 The station began broadcasting on 29 July 1968 from new studios at Kirkstall Road in Leeds. Although they were purpose-built for colour production and equipped with ¬£2.2 million of equipment, the majority of initial broadcasts were in monochrome until the ITV network formally launched its colour output on 15 November 1969. After an opening ceremony led by The Duchess of Kent, the station's first programme was live coverage of the Test cricket match between England and Australia at Headingley. Other programmes broadcast on YTV's opening day included the first edition of its regional news programme Calendar, the station's first networked production ‚Äì the 'Playhouse' drama Daddy Kiss it Better ‚Äì and a light entertainment special, First Night, hosted by Bob Monkhouse. The station was hit hard financially when the transmitter mast at Emley Moor collapsed in March 1969 under a heavy build-up of ice. This left the major part of the region uncovered by Yorkshire Television plus BBC2 who broadcast from the same mast. A temporary mast was quickly erected and television to the West Riding of Yorkshire resumed, albeit with reduced coverage. From this, the company grew and by May 1970 the company was making profits of over ¬£689,000. After a series of temporary masts at Emley Moor, the current 275 metre reinforced concrete tower ‚Äî topped by a 55-metre steel lattice mast ‚Äî began transmitting in 1971, resuming full area coverage for the YTV region. In June 1969, talks began between Yorkshire and Anglia about achieving a cost-cutting exercise by sharing equipment and facilities. Neither company planned joint productions or a merger. The decision to form an association was purely down to the costs of the increased levy on the companies' advertising revenue by the government, and the cost of colour TV. The ITA stated there was no reason why the companies should not have talks about sensible economies that could be made, but would examine all details before any association were to be implemented.Yorkshire, Anglia in TV link talks.BY BROADCASTING CORRESPONDENT. The Times (London, England), Saturday, 7 June 1969 In January 1970, a warning was given that regionalism would be abandoned and a forced merger with Anglia Television would happen unless the chancellor reduced the levy applied on advertising revenues, which was also not helped by the high cost with colour television and the introduction of UHF,TV crisis may force mergers.By DAVID WOOD The Times, Thursday, 1 January 1970; which the government agreed to a few months later. With the introduction of UHF broadcasting, YTV had failed to gain the Bilsdale transmitter in North Yorkshire, which was allocated instead to Tyne Tees Television due to the transmitter's penetration into Teesside and County Durham. This seriously reduced YTV's monopoly commercial broadcast area. Partially to address this issue, in 1974 the Independent Broadcasting Authority reallocated the Belmont Transmitter, then served by Anglia Television, to YTV. Although the area served by Belmont was largely rural, it did cover the more industrial centres of Hull, Grimsby, Scunthorpe and Lincoln and it was felt the region would be better served from Leeds rather than from Norwich. = Trident Television = In August 1970Yorkshire and Tyne Tees TV plan to merge. By ROSS DAVIES. The Times, Friday, 21 August 1970; p. 17; following a reverse takeover Yorkshire Television was effectively merged with its neighbour Tyne Tees Television, when the two were brought under the control of Trident Television Limited, a company formed to deal with the problem of effective ownership of the Bilsdale transmitter and the allocation of airtime. It is often contended that the other point of the trident was intended to be Anglia Television, but they were prevented from joining by the Independent Broadcasting Authority. However, it appears that the third 'point' was to be Trident's non-television interests and that Anglia were never considered as partners in the enterprise. The two stations remained separately run and were required to demerge by late 1981 as a condition of the re-awarding of their ITV contracts from January 1982. Trident's majority shareholdings were sold although they retained ownership of studios and equipment which were leased to the respective companies. On 28 March 1977, Yorkshire launched a breakfast television experiment.Yorkshire's forthcoming experiment in breakfast viewing may sound the ... Fiddick, Peter The Guardian (1959-2003); 21 February 1977; Good Morning Calendar is credited as being the UK's first breakfast television programme, six years before the launch of the BBC's Breakfast Time. The programme ran concurrently with a similar Tyne Tees programme, Good Morning North for North East viewers. Both series ended after nine weeks on 27 May 1977. = 1970s/Industrial relations = From its inception YTV had a turbulent relationship with the broadcasting unions (a common theme within ITV). Many employees at the new company were recruited from the Manchester and Birmingham studios of the former ABC Weekend Television and the London station Rediffusion; the upheaval of enforced job changes on these employees combined with a relatively new management of a new ITV station and huge investment by shareholders provided fertile ground for the unions. In 1971, technicians broadcast a handwritten note that read \\"'Yorkshire Television have threatened to sack us. We are going on strike. Goodnight.\\" six minutes before the end of \\"Kate\\". A black screen appeared before that evening's News at Ten was broadcast. The dispute was involving ACTT union members who had refused to work overtime due to pay rates.TV blackout as viewers see warning of strike. The Times, Saturday, 10 July 1971 YTV was forced off the air by more industrial action over the whole of Christmas, 1978. This partially coincided with a two-day national shutdown of both BBC channels by strikes in December of that year, meaning that for those two days viewers in the region had no television at all. Many of ITV's Christmas programmes were eventually shown in the Yorkshire region in early 1979, after the dispute had ended. In the ITV strike of 1979, the station, like the rest of the network, was off the air for over two months (although appeals by the West Yorkshire Police in their search for the murderer known as the Yorkshire Ripper were periodically transmitted during the strike). However the dispute was more intense at YTV as the company's management were seen as instrumental in fighting the unions, especially the managing director Sir Paul Fox and Trident Chairman G E Ward Thomas. In the 1980 franchise round several YTV staff submitted their own application for the Yorkshire franchise under the name of 'Television Yorkshire'. Backed by Donald Baverstock and MP Jonathan Aiken who believed they would provide a better service.Starter's orders for the great ITV stakes The Guardian (1959‚Äì2003); 10 May 1980; Yorkshire retained the franchise with the addition of number of relay transmitters on the Lancashire/Yorkshire border, covering Todmorden and Walsden, which were transferred from the Granada region.ITV's framework for survival in the eighties: Expectations of a harsh ...

The Times, Saturday, 7 November 1992; 174 at Leeds, and 115 at Newcastle, with a further three from airtime sales in London. Various programmes which had previously been shown at a regional pace were suddenly jolted forward to the furthest ahead point among YTV and Tyne Tees. YTV had to lose over 200 episodes of The Young Doctors to reach the Tyne Tees stage of the serial. Similarly Tyne Tees had to lose over 50 episodes of Blockbusters and two episodes of Prisoner: Cell Block H. Other programmes were also affected.

Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am, became YTTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 2 September 1996, Bruce Gyngell made the controversial move of re- branding Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television under the unified brand \\"Channel 3\\" While Yorkshire used a scaled-back version of this branding (still using the Yorkshire chevron logo and being verbally known as \\"Channel 3 Yorkshire\\"), Tyne Tees was re-branded as \\"Channel 3 North East\\". It dropped the familiar TTTV logo, and relegated the Tyne Tees name to secondary branding. = Granada plc and ITV plc = On 26 June 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by Granada Group plc (now ITV plc).MAM unlikely to back Granada's YTTV offer.Eric Reguly. The Times (London, England), Thursday, 26 June 1997; p. 27 Granada's first move was to scrap the Channel 3 branding, from 9 March 1998. However, dual branding with the \\"ITV\\" name was introduced a year later. In 1998, transmission operations and presentation for all of Granada's stations in the North of England moved to Yorkshire, with the creation of the Northern Transmission Centre. This highly automated server based system was the source to Border, Tyne Tees and Granada as well as the Yorkshire regional output. Continuity from Leeds ended in October 2002, after a unified presentation department for ITV1 in England was set up by London News Network. The transmission operation continues at the Kirkstall Road studios, under the ownership of Technicolor SA. Since 2004, the centre has also provided playout for ITV Central. On 28 October 2002, Yorkshire Television was rebranded as ITV1 Yorkshire. The ITV1 Yorkshire branding continued to appear before some regional programming until November 2006, when a rebrand saw the sole local ident discontinued. The famous chevron logo continued to appear after programmes made by ITV Yorkshire until 31 October 2004. Today, networked programming made at the Leeds studios by ITV is credited to ITV Studios. ITV Yorkshire is also home to Shiver Productions. The licence for Yorkshire is now held by ITV Broadcasting Limited, part of ITV plc.  Studios  Yorkshire Television studios The studios were built on of slum clearance land on Kirkstall Road, purchased from the former Leeds Corporation. Construction commenced in early 1967. A mild winter aided building work and by mid-1968 studios one and two were equipped for transmission (studios three and four being completed by early 1969). During construction, pre-launch shows were produced at the ABC studios at Didsbury, Manchester while a former trouser- press factory next to the Leeds facility was used as an administration centre. The studio was officially opened by The Duchess of Kent on 29 July 1968. It was the first purpose-built colour television production centre in Europe and cost over ¬£4 million to build and equip. Equipment was installed by EMI Electronics and the Marconi Corporation. The studios contained seven 2\\" Quadruplex VTR machines, six telecines and twelve cameras. The cameras were a mixture of Marconi MkVII's (studios 1, 2 and 3) and EMI 2001 models (studio 4). The regional news show Calendar was produced at the centre for many years but in 1989 was moved to a dedicated newsroom and broadcast facility based in a converted ice rink next to the main studios. Recent productions include Countdown (which has since moved to The Manchester Studios and now Media City in Salford), the revived Bullseye, Mastermind (while asbestos was removed from The Manchester Studios in 2006), My Parents Are Aliens, new Channel 4 gameshow Win My Wage and a new children's comedy-drama for Cartoon Network called My Spy Family. The site is now home to continuity for ITV's northern transmission areas (although this is now managed, along with its southern counterpart, by Technicolor Network Services ) and a number of independent producers. The production facilities are marketed as The Leeds Studios and sister companies ProVision, Film Lab North and The Finishing School occupy adjacent buildings, although the operation continues to be widely referred to as the Yorkshire Television studios or YTV. In March 2009, ITV plc announced that the Leeds Studios were to be largely closed in an effort to save costs following a reported loss of ¬£2.7 billion for 2008. However, seven months later ITV changed its mind, choosing instead to close the nearby studios dedicated to the production of Emmerdale and transferring production of this programme to Kirkstall Road which would be upgraded for HDTV production.  Identity  Yorkshire Television logo used from the 1960s to 1980s. For almost 35 years, Yorkshire Television's on-screen identity always revolved around the use of the station logo: the chevron. This yellow symbol was seen on nearly all of Yorkshire Television's idents and presentation. The first symbol used was a black and white chevron, formed by slit-scan techniques and accompanied by an orchestral version of the tune \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\", a famous Yorkshire folk song. This music was later to become the station's jingle. This ident continued until Yorkshire Television officially commenced their colour broadcasts in November 1969. Contains videos of all of the YTV idents. Contains images of the idents The new colour ident featured the yellow chevron on a black background with the still caption card \\"Yorkshire Television Colour Production\\", along with a simplified version of \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\". This ident was modified in 1981, so that the caption \\"Colour Production\\" was changed to \\"In Colour\\", and in 1982 the colour caption was removed altogether. The new version of the jingle was at a lower pitch than was previously composed. Supplementing the ident throughout this period were idents promoting the station's coverage, with the slogan \\"Serving Six Million Viewers\\". One version, in 1983 featured a giant chevron logo, made up out of smaller chevrons, and another in 1986 featured the view zooming in from space, to the Yorkshire TV region, which then flipped over, becoming the chevron. This last version was computer animated, with 3D-style lettering and chevron. On 5 January 1987, Yorkshire Television introduced a new ident, entitled \\"Liquid Gold\\", featuring a pool of liquified gold, with the chevron rising up from it, and rotating into the sky, where the station name joins it. This ident features a fully orchestrated version of the theme tune and reportedly cost ¬£40,000 to make. This was occasionally supplemented by a large rotating chevron over a gradient-ed blue background, used over continuity. On 1 September 1989, Yorkshire Television adopted the first ITV generic look, featuring the large ITV logo, addition ident was also used where a static chevron on the same background as the main ident. On 7 January 1991, the ident was revised to allow the Chevron to appear full screen instead of being a segment of the 'V' which the company used until 23 October 1994. The whole package was used by Yorkshire Television, and an adapted version, where the whole chevron appeared in the V segment before moving into centre screen, was used before regional programming. =1990s= Upon YTV dropping the generic look on 24 October 1994, a new ident was introduced, featuring a textured background with a central strip containing images of the region itself, with the chevron placed in the centre of said strip. The most noticeable thing about this ident set was the smooth nature of the chevron's appearance and, like the previous look, did not feature the \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\" jingle, instead favouring a smooth orchestral jingle. The background was later changed from a cream to a light blue, and variations on the theme for special occasions and yearly themes were also introduced. The Yorkshire Chevron logo as used from 4 November 1996 to 8 March 1998, throughout the Channel 3 era. Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television adopted a new branding package, based on the concept of Channel 3. The new look was fully implemented in the Tyne Tees region on 2 September 1996, where all on-screen branding was replaced by giant numeral '3', and the Tyne Tees brand became secondary to 'Channel 3 North East, however the look was only partially implemented in the Yorkshire region a month after Tyne Tees's revamp. The entirety of Yorkshire's Channel 3 look included an ident which was later introduced on 4 November 1996 at the same year, where the chevron span against a light blue background with numeral '3's covering the background. Another ident featured the chevron with the '3' numeral embossed on the side, which would zoom into view, before revealing a spinning numeral 3, which in turn had YTV chevron on the middle of the 3 and when zoomed into, the chevron re-appeared spinning against the background. The look also heralded the return of the \\"On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at\\" tune, which was now noticeably higher in pitch. The Channel 3 look was dropped on 9 March 1998, following Granada's acquisition of Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television, with the look returning to a spinning chevron against a misty blue background, light blue during the day and dark blue in the evenings. =2000s= a 2001-2 ident, featuring the region's familiar logo ITV Yorkshire logo used from 2006 to 2013. On 8 November 1999, Yorkshire Television adopted the second generic look, based on the theme of hearts, which was used for the entirety of the branding period before network programming. However, for local programming, Yorkshire created their own ident featuring a background of spinning chevrons, with pictures of the region featuring inside a central box. On 28 October 2002, the brand was dropped in favour of a national ITV1 identity, in which local regional identities were dropped except before local programming, when the Yorkshire name appeared below the ITV1 logo only.

The presenter Alan Whicker became a shareholder in the company at its inception and made many programmes for the station, most notably interviews with the Cat's Eye inventor Percy Shaw and the Haiti dictator Baby Doc Duvalier. = Drama/Serial = In Drama Yorkshire Television had many critical successes including, as listed below *15: The Life and Death of Philip Knight *1914 All Out *A Bit of a Do *A Is for Acid *A Pinch of Snuff *A Touch of Frost *At Home with the Braithwaites *Black Velvet Band *Beecham *Chiller *Circles of Deceit *Coming Home *Dickens of London *Demob *Ellington *Emmerdale *Fat Friends *Flambards *Flying Lady *Gazette *Hadleigh *Harry's Game *Heartbeat *Hunting Venus *Imogen's Face *Lost for Words *March in Windy City *May We Borrow Your Husband? *Micawber *Mother's Day *My Uncle Silas *Neville's Island *Paparazzo *Parkin's Patch *Rich Tea and Sympathy *Shipman *Shoot to Kill *Stalag Luft *Stay Lucky *Steel River Blues *Strike Force *Supply and Demand *The Beiderbecke Trilogy *The Booze Cruise *The Brides in the Bath *The Cater Street Hangman *The Darling Buds of May *The Dying of the Light *The Flint Street Nativity *The Glory Boys *The Governor *The Lady's Not for Burning *The Life and Crimes of William Palmer *The Main Chance *The Organization *The Outsider *The Quest *The Racing Game *The Royal *The Royal Today *The Sandbaggers *The Wanderer *The World of Eddie Weary *Tears in the Rain *Till We Meet Again *Tom Grattan's War *Trial & Retribution *Verdict *West of Paradise *Yellowthread Street Emmerdale village built by YTV in 1997 for filming. In 1969, YTV launched its first soap opera Castle Haven which was cancelled after only a year. When the restrictions on daytime broadcasting were relaxed, and on 16 October 1972 it launched an afternoon drama/soap opera called Emmerdale Farm, (which is still being broadcast as Emmerdale). = Comedy/Sitcom = In comedy (and in sitcom), Yorkshire TV produced many popular shows (and comedy series) such as, as listed below *Albert and Victoria *All Change *All Our Saturdays *Beryl's Lot *Dawson's Weekly *Dear Mother...Love Albert *Don't Ask Me *Downwardly Mobile *Duty Free *Farrington of the F.O. *Fiddlers Three *Good Girl *Haggard *Hallelujah! *High & Dry *His And Hers *Home to Roost *How's Your Father? *In Loving Memory *Inside George Webley *Jokers Wild *Just Us *Langley Bottom *Life Begins at Forty *Margie and Me *Mr. Digby Darling *My Husband and I *My Old Man *No Strings *Oh No, It's Selwyn Froggitt! *On the House *Only When I Laugh *Plaza Patrol *Queenie's Castle *Rising Damp *Room at the Bottom *See You Friday *Shine a Light *Singles *Sir Yellow *That's My Boy *The Bounder *The Gaffer *The Gingerbread Girl *The Nesbitts are Coming *The New Statesman *There Comes A Time *That's My Boy *Thicker Than Water *Third Time Lucky *Thundercloud *TV Squash *You're Only Young Twice This side (and department) of Yorkshire Television, also gave the comedian Les Dawson his first major series. This line-up of sitcoms (and comedy series) also made various household names of well-known faces of British Television, especially in UK sitcom too. = Children = For children, YTV contributed many networked shows including *Animal Kwackers *Adam's Family Tree *Bad Influence! *Bellamy‚Äôs Bugle *Follyfoot *Get Up and Go! *Gideon *Junior Showtime *Little Blue *Mister Trimble *My Parents Are Aliens *Puddle Lane *Ragdolly Anna *Round the Bend *Stepping Stones *'The Big Bang *The Book Tower *The Flaxton Boys *The Giddy Game Show *The Raggy Dolls *The Riddlers *The Wanderer *Toucan Tecs *Tumbledown Farm *Utterly Brilliant *Wilmot *The New Addams Family'' as well as the long-running How We Used To Live for ITV's Schools and Colleges' output. = Entertainment/Game shows = In entertainment, YTV had also produced a large number of networked quiz shows, including, but not limited to: *3-2-1 *Ask No Questions *Bruce's Price is Right (1995-2001) *Casino *Countdown (for Channel 4) *Fun and Games' (1985-1992) *Raise the Roof (1995‚Äì96) *Talkabout *Tarby's Frame Game *The Indoor League *Time Please, (1990-2) *Winner Takes All YTV has also produced some religious shows, including Stars on Sunday. = Broadcasting = The company invested heavily in outside broadcast facilities and was a large contributor to ITV Sport, responsible primarily for covering northern-based horserace meetings (with London Weekend Television and Thames Television covering the south and ATV covering the Midlands) amongst other sporting events. In the field of investigative journalism the station soon gained an international reputation for award-winning documentaries: 1975 saw the transmission of the BAFTA award-winning Johnny Go Home, a startling expos√© of teenage male prostitution and homelessness in London. In the same year the station transmitted Too Long a Winter (also a BAFTA award-winner), featuring Yorkshire Daleswoman Hannah Hauxwell who lived an austere and harsh life whilst running her small farm. In 1979 the documentary Rampton: The Secret Hospital, making public the treatment of patients at the Nottinghamshire mental care facility Rampton Hospital, led to a Government investigation ‚Äì it also won an international Emmy award for the station. Another 1979 documentary The Underground Eiger detailed the record-breaking cave dive of Oliver Statham and Geoff Yeadon. The 1989 documentary Four Hours in My Lai (broadcast as part of the monthly First Tuesday strand) revealed new information about the 1968 massacre. Yorkshire Television also produced the 1989 documentary One Day in the Life of Television. YTV often led the way in British commercial broadcasting. As well as building the first purpose-built colour studios on Europe it was the first to offer breakfast television. In 1977, the station took part in a nine-week trial offering viewers an extra hour of programming at breakfast time, beginning transmission at 8:30am with a 15-minute national and regional news bulletin called Good Morning Calendar alongside cartoons and episodes of Peyton Place. A similar experiment was carried out by Tyne Tees Television around the same time. In August 1986, it became the first terrestrial station in Britain to offer 24-hour television. This was achieved by simulcasting the satellite station Music Box from around midnight to the start of TV-am's transmission. Both YTV and Music Box were partly owned by the same company (WHSmith). The experiment ended shortly before Music Box closed down in January 1987 and was replaced by a teletext-based Jobfinder service which broadcast for one hour after closedown. YTV re-introduced 24-hour programming 18 months later along with the rest of the ITV network, beginning full-time 24-hour broadcasting on 30 May 1988. In the mid-1980s, Yorkshire broke from the network by refusing to screen the BAFTA Awards, claiming them to be slaps on the backs of the BBC. The film The Sting was a replacement in 1986. As the rest of the network overran in the live BAFTA screening, Yorkshire had to cobble together minor programmes until other regions were able to screen the late-running ITN News. In the 1990s, while Bruce Gyngell was managing director, Yorkshire declined to show several late-night programmes, including The Good Sex Guide. One such series, Hollywood Lovers, was replaced with Alan Whicker repeats.

They are the sole members of the genus Irena and family Irenidae, and are related to the ioras and leafbirds. These are bulbul-like birds of open forest or thorn scrub, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colouration, fairy-bluebirds are sexually dimorphic, with the males being dark blue in plumage, and the females duller green. These species eat fruit, especially figs, and possibly some insects. They lay two to three eggs in a tree nest. The call of the Asian fairy-bluebird is a liquid two note Glue-It. As the names would suggest, the Asian fairy-bluebird occurs across southern Asia, and the Philippine fairy- bluebird in that archipelago. Taxonomy The first scientists to examine fairy-bluebirds placed them in the genus Coracias, presumably on the strength of the iridescent blue plumage on the back. This was challenged in the 1820s by Thomas Horsfield and Coenraad Temminck, who suggested a relationship instead with the drongos.Wells, D. (2005) \\"Family Irenidae\\" Pp. 268-277 in del Hoyo, J.; Elliot, A. & Christie D. (editors). (2005). Handbook of the Birds of the World. Volume 10: Cuckoo-Shrikes to Thrushes. Lynx Edicions. It was variously placed with the bulbuls and orioles as well. On the basis of the DNA-DNA hybridization studies of Sibley and Alhquist its closest relatives have now been identified as the leafbirds. The leafbirds are sometimes included in the family Irenidae with the fairy-bluebirds, but the time since the apparent divergence suggests that they are better treated as separate families. Morphology Fairy-bluebirds are robust birds that resemble Old World orioles in shape and size. Males are larger than females, and the two species weigh between 50-100 g, with some of that variation being caused by sexual differences and some by geographic variation. There are clines in size differences in both species which can be attributed to Bergmann's rule, with the northernmost populations being larger on average. Both species have a powerful deep and notched bill used for crushing, with that of the Philippine species being larger. Their feet are small, which suggests that they spend less time climbing in order to feed and more time on the wing. The plumage of the fairy-bluebirds is exceptional, with the upperparts being deep rich blue. The Asian fairy-bluebird is sexually dimorphic in its plumage, the male being much brighter than the female, but the Philippine fairy-bluebird exhibits much less difference and the female is almost as bright as the male. The deep colour is provided by specialised naked feather-tip barbs. Although the fairy- bluebirds are highly visible in sunlight they are much less visible in the shade of the forest. Distribution and habitat The Asian fairy-bluebird has a discontinuous distribution from India to Java and Vietnam. In India the species is present in the south west of the country and in the north east. From Burma it has a continuous distribution (in suitable habitat) throughout most of South East Asia, and down into Borneo and Sumatra, as well as on the Andaman Islands. The species has not been reliably recorded on Sri Lanka since the 1870s. The Philippine fairy-bluebird is found on Luzon, Polillo, Leyte, Samar, Mindanao, Dinagat and Basilan. The fairy-bluebirds are dependent upon fruit producing forests, but both species seem to exist in a wide range of forests, both evergreen and semi-evergreen. Within forests they are generally found in the canopy. Behaviour Female feeding on Ficus figs Pairs or small groups (individuals are seldom seen alone) of fairy-bluebirds forage widely to obtain food. Fruit, particularly figs in the genus Ficus, are the most important item in the diet of fairy-bluebirds. Fairy-bluebirds will generally eat fruit of a certain size, and will crush larger fruits in order to make them manageable. Most food is obtained in the canopy. In addition to fruit berries may be eaten, as well as nectar, although this behaviour has only been reported in birds in India. In contrast to adults, however, insects are the principal component of the diet of nestlings. In the Philippines birds have been observed following troops of macaques, possibly in order to collect flushed insects.Ken Stott, Jr. (1947) \\"Fairy Bluebird: Long-Tailed Macaque Association on Mindanao\\" Auk 64 (1): 130 Male courtship displays include elaborate vocalizations, which the female responds to with nest building. Nests are constructed in trees or tall bushes from twigs, moss and grasses, and males and females cooperate in rearing chicks.\\"Fairy Bluebird Fact Sheet, Lincoln Park Zoo\\" Mythology In old Tagalog mythology in southern Luzon (Philippines), the fairy bluebirds were known as the tigmamanukan omen birds. All of which were the omen birds of Bathala, the supreme god of the Tagalog people prior to the arrival of the Spanish. According to legend, Bathala ordered a tigmamanukan bird to crack in one peck the bamboo which let out the first man, Malakas, and first woman, Maganda. In another legend, Bathala also sends the tigmamanukan bird (sometimes the tigmamanukan snake or lizard as there are three tigmamanukan forms) to aid mankind if they need to proceed or halt a journey. If a traveler sees a tigmamanukan omen, and it passes from right to left, then it symbolizes as labay (Bathala's approval to proceed with the journey). If the tigmamanukan omen passes from left to right, the traveller should not proceed, or else he or she will never return. All tigmamanukan omen birds are said to live in the mythical Mount Batala (a sacred mountain of Bathala).https://pinoy-culture.com/the-tigmamanukan- mythology-from-the-philippines/ References External links *Fairy- bluebird videos on the Internet Bird Collection ja:„Ç≥„Éé„Éè„Éâ„É™Áßë (Sibley) ","title":"Fairy-bluebird"},{"id":"268092","text":"ITV Tyne Tees, previously known as Tyne Tees, Channel 3 North East and Tyne Tees Television, is the ITV television franchise for North East England and parts of North Yorkshire. The analogue signals in the Tyne Tees region were switched off in 2012, making the station, along with ITV London and UTV, one of the last ITV regions to solely broadcast digitally. Tyne-Tees Television Ltd and Tyne-Tees Television Holdings still legally exist. Each of these companies is, along with most other regional companies owned by ITV plc, listed at Companies House as a \\"Dormant company\\". Tyne Tees launched on 15 January 1959 from studios at a converted warehouse in City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne, remaining in the city until July 2005 when Tyne Tees moved to smaller studios in Gateshead. Tyne Tees has contributed various programming to the ITV network and Channel 4, as well as its regional output. Some of Tyne Tees' best known programming includes the groundbreaking music show The Tube, critically acclaimed adaptations of Catherine Cookson novels, and children's programmes such as Supergran. The ownership and management structure of Tyne Tees has altered across its history, particularly in various mergers with Yorkshire Television. The two stations were managed by Trident Television during the 1970s, and the two stations merged again in 1992 to form Yorkshire- Tyne Tees Television. A series of takeovers and mergers across the ITV network, instigated by the large groups Granada and Carlton, led to Tyne Tees becoming part of ITV plc in 2004. History =Launch and the 1960s= The station's first logo. The three Ts morphed from an anchor, reflecting the nautical influence of the station's name.Independent television was introduced to Britain in September 1955. Initially only available in the London region, commercial television steadily became available in other regions. After a financially difficult time for the first ITV companies, the Independent Television Authority (ITA) decided to offer independent television to the rest of the country and advertised for bids. Several offers were submitted, including from the existing four companies, to the ITA. North East England was the last of the English regions without a television transmitter. Sir Richard Pease headed a local consortium that included film producer Sydney Box and News Chronicle executives George and Alfred Black. This consortium, was chosen from among eleven applicants because of its strong local links, commitment to local programming, concentrating on regional topical matters, and educational and children's programmes. The contract was awarded on 12 December 1957. Experienced television executive Anthony Jelly was appointed as managing director, although historian Andrew Spicer credits the Black brothers as the driving force and public face of Tyne Tees; George was programme director, and both brothers were prominent board members. The company opened its first Newcastle office at Bradburn House on Northumberland Street, and it was from there, on 3 January 1958, the company directors issued 300,000 ordinary shares at fours shillings each. Tyne Tees is named after two of the region's three primary rivers. ITA considered the original name, \\"North East England\\", was imprecise. Some of the consortium's suggestions were rejected: \\"Three Rivers Television\\" for being obscure, and \\"Tyne, Wear, and Tees\\" for being too long. Eventually, in October 1958, the name \\"Tyne Tees\\" was announced. The other major river, the Wear (which runs between the Tyne and the Tees), was represented within Tyne Tees' early signature tune \\"Three Rivers Fantasy\\". The BBC transmitted their programmes from the Pontop Pike transmitting station in County Durham. The ITA built a new transmitter nearby at Burnhope, to cover an area from Alnwick to Northallerton, and west to Middleton-in-Teesdale. Television sets required a new aerial, the Yagi array, to receive the high frequency that the transmitter was using. Tyne Tees went on air at 5 pm on 15 January 1959, three years after the first British independent television station, and the tenth such station to launch. The then-prime minister Harold Macmillan, who had been the Member of Parliament for the nearby Stockton-on- Tees for two decades, was interviewed live on the opening night. This was followed by a live variety show, named The Big Show, broadcast from a small studio. However, this local content was followed by an episode of the American police series Highway Patrol and an evening of entertainment programmes including I Love Lucy and Double Your Money. The full first night's programming was : 17:00 Three Rivers Fantasy - opening by the Duke of Northumberland. : 17:02 Robin Hood : 17:32 Popeye : 17:45 ITN News : 17:55 Local News : 18:30 Highway Patrol : 19:00 The Big Show, starring Dickie Henderson : 20:00 Double Your Money : 20:30 This Week : 21:00 Wagon Train : 22:00 ITN News : 22:15 Murder Bag : 22:45 I Love Lucy : 23:15 Epilogue read by the Bishop of Durhamhttp://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/TTT/programmes.html In the 2006 documentary A History of Tyneside, veteran North East newsreader Mike Neville suggested that the launch of Tyne Tees enabled local people to be able to hear local accents and dialects on television, since early broadcasters, particularly those from the BBC, tended to speak in Received Pronunciation. Scholar Natasha Vall suggests that the station's commitment to broadcasting comedy helped establish a regional identity. George and Alfred Black had toured working men's clubs looking for material for television. Local comic Bobby Thompson was invited to host a solo show. However, poor ratings and an unenthusiastic cast led to the show's cancellation after barely a year. Where most independent television companies published their schedules in the magazine TV Times, Tyne Tees produced their own listings magazine. The Viewer was published by News Chronicle, a company with connections to the station through the Black brothers. It was produced to satisfy \\" 'Tyne Tees' policy to be most regional of all the independent stations\\". Initially produced from an office in Forth Lane, near Newcastle station, it moved to the City Road studios when Dickens Press took over publication in 1963. The magazine became the biggest selling magazine in the region, with a circulation of 300,000 per week. New contracts issued by the ITA in 1968 stipulated that all ITV companies publish their listings in the TV Times, which became a national magazine with regional variations for the listings. After 498 editions, the last issues of The Viewer was published in September 1968. The first advertisement screened on Tyne Tees was for Welch's Toffee. The proprietor's niece is Denise, who would become a well-known actress and personality. In 1959, Tyne Tees charged advertisers ¬£100 for 15 seconds during prime time. The station launched a marketing campaign in the 1960s to sell advertising time named 'Through Plan'. One of the range of promotional material was a poster called 'Sweet Sixteen', featuring photographs of 15 men accompanied by their full names, job titles and other formal history. The sole woman was simply referred to by her first name and her measurements. Historian Geoff Phillips comments that this \\"was a profound statement of the culture of the time\\". Tyne Tees produced Advertising Magazines (AdMags), which were programmes with a loose storyline designed to advertise several products within an edition. The 15-minute programmes each endorsed about 12 products. Clients sat in the control room during rehearsals to ensure that their products were getting the exposure for which they had paid. A committee was established in 1960 under the leadership of British industrialist Sir Harry Pilkington to consider the future of broadcasting. The 1962 Pilkington Report criticised ITV, and Tyne Tees in particular. Some companies, historian Simon Cherry notes, were scrambling \\"very readily for the lowest common denominator ... Tyne Tees was notorious for avoiding minority programmes and putting out cop shows or westerns instead.\\" =1970s= Tyne Tees cameraman on the banks of the River Wear in 1982. Following his report, Pilkington prompted the government to impose a levy on ITV's revenue, the effects of which were heightened by a recession in 1970 when revenue had declined by 12 percent in real terms. Despite a reduction of the levy, Tyne Tees was one of the contractors facing collapse. To ensure Tyne Tees' survival, the ITA allowed it to affiliate with Yorkshire Television under a joint management company named 'Trident Television'. The third 'prong' of Trident was intended to be Anglia Television, but the IBA ruled out their involvement. Trident Television was formed in March 1969 as a joint venture to sell advertisements for Tyne Tees and Yorkshire. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees then came under Trident's ownership on 1 January 1974. For the first time, one company owned two distinct and separate ITV franchises although the new company was dominated by the larger, stronger Yorkshire whose shareholders owned 71.5 percent of the new company. Trident had sales offices in London, where most agencies are located and where most advertising is bought and sold. A major factor in the merger was that when UHF transmission was introduced in 1969 to accommodate colour television it was found that the key Bilsdale transmitting station in North Yorkshire so dominated the territories of both companies that its allotment to either individual company would have seriously prejudiced the coverage and sales revenue of the other. The ITA agreed that Tyne Tees and Yorkshire could be considered as one company for the purposes of selling airtime, while expressing their individual identities in their programming output. A political scandal caused problems during one of Tyne Tees' franchise renewals. Producer Tony Sandford recalls that Lord Pilkington was sent by the ITA to question the station's executives. One-time leader of Newcastle City Council T. Dan Smith had been convicted for accepting bribes concerning the redevelopment of Newcastle city centre. Pointing out that Smith became a director of the station, Pilkington asked why Tyne Tees failed to produce a documentary about a Newcastle politician, instead leaving it to Manchester- based Granada's current affairs programme World in Action. By the late seventies, Tyne-Tees's locally made programming amounted to an average of less than nine hours a week, with the remainder of programming from the ITV network. In 1978, The Economist reported that a group called Northumbria Television, partially financed by local firms Bellway Holding and Swan Hunter, applied to the IBA to take over the franchise from the \\"tired\\" Tyne Tees for the two and a half years until the scheduled franchise renewal in 1981. =1980s= Tyne Tees News Unit car. Yorkshire and Tyne Tees applied separately for renewal of the franchises in 1980, and each won. However, the two companies were required to demerge from January 1982 as a condition of the renewal of their ITV franchises. The Independent Broadcasting Authority (IBA), the successor to the ITA, recognised the criticism, reported The Economist, \\"that Trident was London-dominated, overly diversified, and out of touch with the grass roots. It instructed Trident to set up both companies as independents and to retain only a minority shareholding in each.\\" The IBA imposed the condition that for the 1980 franchise round a company could only own one franchise, although it could earn up to 30 percent of another. By November 1981, Trident had sold all but residual stakes in the two companies (15% and 20% respectively). When the new licences started in January 1982, Trident sold all but 30 percent of Yorkshire, and 25 percent of Tyne Tees. During the 1980s, Tyne Tees began to develop separate services for the Northern and Southern halves of the region. From a small two-camera studio at Corporation House in the centre of Middlesbrough, Tyne Tees developed nightly opt-out news bulletins for Teesside, County Durham and North Yorkshire as part of the flagship magazine programme Northern Life. The company also pioneered non-news programming for the two sub-regions, including the nightly Epilogues, which ended a 29-year run in September 1988 when Tyne Tees commenced 24-hour broadcasting although it had run an on-screen Jobfinder teletext service throughout the night since November 1987. Meanwhile, developments in satellite and cable television, in addition to the two BBC channels and the new Channel 4, began to put pressure on ITV's finances. ITV lost 3 percent of advertising between 1993 and 1994. =1990s=  1993 Franchise Round and Yorkshire- Tyne Tees merger  In 1990, Yorkshire bought Vaux Breweries' 19 percent stake in Tyne Tees, costing ¬£5.1 million. In the same year, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher initiated a blind auction system, through the Broadcasting Act 1990, through which companies had to bid for the regional franchises. This system was to be used in the 1991 franchise round, which caused large changes to the network. Granada Television, the franchise holder for North West England, had long thought that the North of England should consolidate to \\"counter the potential dominance of the south east\\". Tyne Tees outbid their main competition by ¬£10 million; their main challenger was 'North East Television', which was backed by Granada, Border and local newspaper the Evening Chronicle. Along with HTV and Yorkshire, Tyne Tees believed that they had to bid high to win. These companies bid so high that the Independent Television Commission seriously considered rejecting the business plans of each in turn and disqualifying them. However, they eventually decided in their favour. Together, the now-merged companies were committed to paying about ¬£60 million a year to the government for the right to broadcast, a substantial amount compared to the ¬£2,000 bid by Central, ITV's largest station. New regulations from the ITC allowed Yorkshire to merge with Tyne Tees, this time under the name Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc (YTT), although their ITV franchises remained separate. The merger allowed the companies to avoid collapse following their high franchise bids. This was the first step to ITV becoming one company in England and Wales. The merger led to the culling of staff. YTT's two largest shareholders became Pearson and LWT. From 1 January 1993, Yorkshire and Tyne Tees broadcast all regional programmes simultaneously, affecting programming that had been shown at different paces in different regions (such as Blockbusters and the Australian soap operas The Young Doctors and Prisoner: Cell Block H). Most of the regional programming was produced by Yorkshire and broadcast across the two stations, an area that the ITC considered too broad to be of local interest.  Broadcasting standards  The annual cost of the franchise began to take its toll on the company. At the end of 1993, the company revealed that it was heading for a pre-tax loss in the 1992-93 fiscal year instead of the expected profit. Chairman and chief executive Clive Leach was sacked as a consequence. According to Variety, YTT \\"oversold its airtime to advertisers and failed to meet its ratings targets, resulting in a huge revenue shortfall estimated by analysts at over $20 million.\\" The industry newspaper also reported that the company \\"attempted to bolster its flagging 1992-93 revenues by giving advertisers deep discounts for advance airtime bookings made for the following year.\\" Local MP Peter Mandelson wrote to the Secretary of State for National Heritage, David Mellor, in June 1992, saying \\"Yorkshire and Tyne Tees are motivated by the interests of their shareholders, not their viewers, and need to make urgent savings ... it is quite clear that this is not so much a merger but a gobbling up of a smaller franchise held by a larger company.\\" Yorkshire- Tyne Tees were repeatedly warned over worsening standards at the Newcastle- based station and at one point the Independent Television Commission (the then-governing body of ITV) threatened to revoke the Tyne Tees licence if the situation did not improve. In 1993 the MP Ann Clwyd described Tyne Tees as having been \\"stripped of any meaningful identity since its take over by Yorkshire TV\\" and Ian Ritchie, Managing Director at Tyne Tees, left the company over a widely publicised disagreement with the Yorkshire-Tyne Tees board over what he saw as an unacceptable drive to centralise the company, including the complete closure of all non-news operations at Newcastle and a proposal to close the City Road studios. In October 1993, Yorkshire TV's founder Ward Thomas was brought in to stabilise the situation at the company and quickly returned the company to profitability.Martin Waller. \\"YORKSHIRE'S NEW BROOM TURNS GLOOM INTO BOOM\\". The Times. 15 March 1995. p27  Bruce Gyngell appointed chair  The Channel 3 North East branding, introduced in 1996, was derided by viewers. Granada removed the branding in 1998. Bruce Gyngell, the former chairman of breakfast station TV-am, became YTT's managing director on 15 May 1995. On 16 March 1996, the presentation department in Newcastle was closed, and continuity was centralised in Leeds. (Transmission for the station had already been handled by Yorkshire since 1993). To halting \\"a slide in viewing figures and reflecting confidence in the region\\", in September that year, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc rebranded its stations as Channel 3. The Broadcasting Act 1990 had made Channel 3 the 'official' name for ITV, and \\"3\\" was the preset used by most television sets and videocassette recorders (VCRs) for ITV. However, the attempt in 1989 to create a generic identity across the ITV network was decommissioned within three years. Promoting the new brand, Gygnell said, \\"Everyone refers to this region as 'the North-East' and we want it to be known that we are part of this great region and moving with it.\\" Tyne Tees acquired the brand \\"Channel 3 North East\\", with 'Tyne Tees Television' still being retained as the company name.  Acquisition by Granada  On 26 June 1997, Yorkshire-Tyne Tees Television plc was acquired by the Granada Media Group plc (now ITV plc). The takeover concentrated ownership of the ITV network into three large groups: Granada, Carlton and United News & Media. The new guidelines, published by the ITC in 1998, about the Channel 3 licence renewals signalled substantial cuts in the companies' payments to the Treasury. Licences awarded in 1991 were due to expire in January 2001. However, companies, including Tyne Tees, which had bid high in 1991 were allowed to apply early to try to win financial relief. The new 10-year contract began in January 1999. In 1999, the cost of the tender fee that Tyne Tees was paying fell to ¬£46 million, from the ¬£70.5 million that it paid in 1998. =2000s= This logo, used from November 1999 until October 2002, was generic to the ITV network, with each region's familiar logo appearing in a smaller form. The \\"ITV1\\" logo was added to the logos and idents in August 2001. The design of the 2006 to 2013 logo was generic to the ITV network.  ITV centralisation  Days after the two largest companies in the network, Granada and Carlton, announced that they would merge, the regional names were withdrawn from networked programming in an \\"attempt to make ITV1 more marketable nationally with a single generic brand.\\" (Scottish, which doesn't trail any of the network shows under any ITV1 branding, Grampian, Ulster and Channel, each kept their own names but used their own versions of the new look.) Tyne Tees Television was rebranded as ITV1 Tyne Tees on 28 October 2002. The name \\"Tyne Tees\\" only appeared before regional programmes; the rest of the time, only the \\"ITV1\\" name was shown. The Tyne Tees logo continued to appear after its own programmes. Graeme Thompson was appointed MD and Controller of Programmes at ITV Tyne Tees in 2004, having been appointed Director of Broadcasting in December 1997 and then Controller of Programmes in 2001. He became Dean for Arts, Design and Media at the University of Sunderland in June 2009. In 2004, Granada plc and Carlton Communications merged, creating a single company for all ITV franchises in England and Wales. Tyne Tees became part of ITV plc, the largest television production company in the world, which now owned 90 percent of ITV. On 9 February 2005, Ofcom issued a proposed timetable for ending analogue terrestrial television transmissions as part of the switchover to digital television. Tyne Tees was the penultimate region to cease broadcasting in analogue, which occurred during September 2012. Tyne Tees took over the relay transmitter at Berwick-upon-Tweed in December 2006 from Border Television in order to extend the deadline of the town's upgrade to digital TV by four years, since Border was the first to switch off its analogue signal in 2008. In September 2007, Executive Chairman of ITV plc Michael Grade announced that as part of ITV's five-year business strategy, Tyne Tees' newsroom would merge with Border Television. Politicians have expressed concern, however, that the merger would affect the quality of news for southern Scotland, in particular, would fail if it lost its customised bulletins. The changes would mean that aside from the merged Border-Tyne Tees regional news and political programmes, the station could broadcast only 25 minutes of dedicated North East news every weekday. In October 2008, the National Union of Journalists threatened industrial action if ITV tried to force any of the changes without discussion. Between December 2008 and February 2009, around 50 staff at the station were made redundant or accepted voluntary redundancy, including presenters, journalists and production staff. The new merged ITV Tyne Tees & Border service launched on 25 February 2009. Bullying at Tyne Tees In March 2009, The Guardian newspaper reported that there was bullying at Tyne Tees that lasted for six years. One manager was accused of using inappropriate language about people with disabilities, women reporters, Chinese people and gypsies. The manager was disciplined after one inquiry, but then more journalists complained about the same manager. The manager defended himself by claiming he was using black humour. He finally left the company with a pay-off of about ¬£50,000. The original whistle blower left the company in 2006 and was paid ¬£80,000 after threatening to take his case to an employment tribunal. Following this incident, ITV adopted an anti-bullying programme. An ITV spokesman advised that the total cost of the five bullying investigations was ¬£1 million. =2010s= On 23 July 2013, proposals to reintroduce fully separate regional news services for the ITV Tyne Tees and ITV Border regions were approved by OFCOM. On 16 September 2013 both ITV News Tyne Tees and Lookaround were restored as two single 30-minute regional programmes on weekdays with separate shorter daytime and weekend bulletins reintroduced.OFCOM sets out licence terms for ITV, STV, UTV and Channel 5 , OFCOM, 23 July 2013 Studios Two converted warehouses provided the base for Tyne Tees on City Road until 2005. Tyne Tees's original studios were located on City Road, Newcastle upon Tyne and were converted from two furniture warehouses purchased by the company. These new studios formed the basis of Tyne Tees operations and featured the company offices. The location was deliberately chosen because of its proximity to the telephone exchange in Carliol Square. Television signals were relayed by land-line from the studios to the switching centre; a distance between the studios and the exchange greater than would have significantly increased the cost of receiving the networked programmes from the other ITV stations. The complex initially contained four studios, with a fifth built in 1981 to accommodate productions for Channel 4. Two nearby pubs, The Egypt Cottage and Rose & Crown, became affectionately known as Studio 5 because of the amount of time that the station's staff spent in them. Scottish and Newcastle Breweries offered to sell the adjacent The Egypt Cottage to the station when it was established, but Tyne Tees declined. However, the upstairs room was used as rehearsal space, and the pub would regularly feature in the '80s music show The Tube. River Derwent, since July 2005. The complex continued until 2004 following the merger of Granada and Carlton to form ITV plc. As a result of the merger, ITV plc had (according to the company) an over-capacity of studio facilities and production units around the country, which had previously been rivals, but were now all part of the same group. In order to save money, several large regional headquarters, studio sites and programme departments closed and merged. The decision was taken to close the City Road studios and relocate to a smaller purpose-built complex housing a newsroom and studio, resulting in the loss of up to 30 jobs. A documentary about the move to new premises, The Big Move, reflected that over the years the staff numbers had dropped by about 800, and around 170 people would be moving to the new site.The Big Move, pr. & dir. Sheila Matheson, ITV Tyne Tees, 3 July 2005. Tyne Tees moved to Television House at The Watermark, a new business park adjacent to the MetroCentre in Gateshead, in 2005. The first broadcast from their new base took place on 2 July 2005. Along with the move, news reporters had to learn a range of new skills, such as editing their own reports. The new practices contrasted with early reporting, which had an average crew of five. The new equipment required only a camera operator, who could also operate sound equipment, and a reporter. Television House also acts as a base for ITV SignPost, Britain's biggest supplier of British Sign Language (BSL) services for television, video, CD-ROM, DVD, film and the Internet. In 2010, the studios at City Road along with the neighbouring pub, the Egypt Cottage, were demolished with plans for a residential development on the site. Tyne Tees also has smaller studios and offices in Billingham, York, London and within the Media Centre at the University of Sunderland. Sub-regions Tyne Tees operated two sub-regional news programmes from around 1983 until 2009, having been a commitment in the 1980 contract round. An opt-out was used from the main North East Tonight bulletin that would feature news from each area. Contains images of separate services and detailed narrative on it. Contains images of the opt out services and a detailed narrative from resident of region. These two sub-opts were: *Tyne Tees North - Broadcasting from the Pontop Pike and Chatton transmitters to viewers in Northumberland and Tyne and Wear. Bulletin presented by normal team from Newcastle Studio. *Tyne Tees South - Broadcasting from the Bilsdale transmitter to viewers in County Durham, North Yorkshire and the Tees Valley. During the 1980s and early '90s, this was a recorded segment (complete bulletins during weekday afternoons) presentation of which alternated between Newcastle and Middlesbrough studios (Tyne Tees was unable at the time to broadcast different content live to both transmitters simultaneously and so had to pre-record the southern opt even when presented from Middlesbrough). From 1993-5 a completely separate broadcast \\"Network North\\" was produced from new studios in Billingham (this was intended by YTTTV to be broadcast on some YTV transmitters, and was advertised in the press as such, but in reality it went out on Tyne Tees only. Both local news programmes were renamed Tyne Tees News in 1996). From September 1996 a live 15-minute broadcast from Billingham was inserted into \\"North East Tonight\\", which continued until 2005 when separate live programmes were produced from the Gateshead studios, before these ended in 2009. For nearly a decade during the 1990s and 2000s, the Billingham studios were used for the pan-regional late weekday bulletin, and for a time in the early 2000s Billingham was also used for a sub-regional version of \\"North East Today\\", a daytime magazine programme. As part of a cost saving initiative within ITV plc, Michael Grade announced in 2007 that the regional news service would be reduced from seventeen distinct news programmes and services to nine, affecting all the sub-regional services. As a result, all Tyne Tees sub-opts were ceased immediately. As part of the same plans, he also announced that Tyne Tees would be merged with Border Television, subject to Ofcom approval which occurred the following year, resulting in one large programme covering both regions. The two services were demerged in September 2013 and ITV News Tyne Tees and ITV Border once more began making their own 30 minute news programmes, although unlike other ITV regions which had offered sub-regional services, the Tyne Tees opt-out services were not reinstated at this time. Station identification The logo with which Tyne Tees was most identified. Various versions were used in the 1970s to the 1990s, and it was integrated within some generic ITV logos in the late 1990s. The station identification, or idents for short, of Tyne Tees varied over time; however, most were based the letters TTTV arranged in a box format. The launch ident featured a white anchor which then gradually turned into three letter T's alongside each other. Website contains genuine video recordings of Tyne Tees Idents and continuity announcements, retrieved from old video recordings. This ident was accompanied by a shortened version of the station's signature tune \\"Three Rivers Fantasy\\", a specially commissioned work by composer and arranger Arthur Wilkinson. The musical overture merged several regional folk tunes, such as \\"Water of Tyne\\", ending in The \\"Blaydon Races\\". Part of the medley was based upon \\"The Sailor's Hornpipe\\". The arrival of colour to ITV in 1969 led the companies to re- evaluate their on-screen identities. Tyne Tees replaced the triple-T logo in 1970 with the basic layout of two letter Ts above 'TV', an icon which would be incorporated into many future redesigns. Commentator Andrew Bowden observes that this interlinked design remains strongly associated with the company. The ident also introduced the blue and yellow colour scheme that would remain in use for many years. The dark blue was popular amongst ITV contractors because it closely approximated to black on a black and white television set. The version of the logo included the word 'COLOUR', boasting the new technology. In 1979, the ident was modified once more to remove the word colour and to give it a more dynamic form up. The result was the yellow logo flying down onto a black background before the outline extended out towards the screen, set to a synthesised tune. The name 'Tyne Tees' then flew in below and the background colour faded to blue. The ident was again redesigned in 1988, in which the colour scheme was reversed and lighter shades of blue and yellow used. The form up was also altered to water flowing along sand, before the water divided into the Tyne Tees logo. The logo used computer animation for the first time. However this bold new look was not to last, as Tyne Tees adopted the 1989 ITV generic look. The look consisted of the top left corner of the logo being inserted into the 'V' segment of the ITV logo, with the station name placed underneath the Tyne Tees ITV logo. However, not every ITV station embraced the new logo, and Tyne Tees abandoned it in 1991. The generic ident were replaced with ones produced by Tyne Tees, featuring a large reflective block which the viewpoint rotated around, before panning up to reveal it is the Tyne Tees logo. The music from the previous generic look was retained. Three variations were used, one with a black background, one with a multi coloured background and one with a grey background, with each version taking over from its predecessor after only a few months of use. In 1992, Tyne Tees dropped their famous logo which they had previously been using since 1970 and opted instead for four separate letters stacked atop each other like previously accomplished spelling TTTV. The form up was over a grey background with a line moving across the screen, forming the letters as they went. When Tyne Tees adopted the Channel 3 North East branding in September 1996, the traditional \\"TTTV\\" logo arrangement was dropped in favour of a large '3', with the region written to the left of the '3'. The name \\"Tyne Tees Television\\" was only seen in small letters at the bottom of the screen, whereas Yorkshire, who also adopted the Channel 3 brand a month later, was allowed to keep its 'chevron' logo alongside the '3'. Website contains genuine video recording of the Channel 3 Yorkshire Ident, retrieved from donated video recordings. On- screen announcements said, \\"This is Tyne Tees Television, broadcasting on Channel 3 in the North-East.\\" The new branding was launched on 2 September 1996, with \\"Going Home (The Theme of the Local Hero)\\" by Mark Knopfler regularly accompanying ident sequences. Following Granada's takeover in June 1997, the Channel 3 branding was scrapped in March 1998. As Bob Conlon, regional executive with the Independent Television Commission, said: \\"People never really grasped the name - it didn't exactly trip off the tongue and it was still referred to as Tyne Tees Television, because it has been there for years.\\" All other regions in the network had retained their own identities rather than conforming to the generic 'Channel 3' brand. The \\"TTTV\\" logo returned to television screens in a new form, \\"three-dimensional gold metallic lettering on a blue background\\", on 9 March 1998. This logo was more stylised than the 1992 equivalent and kept the music used throughout the '3' era. However, dual branding with the \\"ITV\\" name was introduced a year later, as part of the 1999 generic look. In this, the Tyne Tees logo was reduced to minuscule lettering in a blue box at the top of the screen, with emphasis being placed on the station name and ITV logo. However, this ident was supplemented by an ident to introduce local programming. This ident introduced on 4 September 2000 featured a new logo: a TTTV variant that was simplified to strictly vertical, horizontal or diagonal lines only. An arc of circles also adorned the top right corner. The ident itself featured pictures from the region. However, despite the new logo, the new logo wasn't applied to the generic idents. From 28 October 2002, all network programmes were introduced with a generic ITV1 ident. Regional programming used a generic ident with the name Tyne Tees below the ITV1 logo until November 2006, after which no regional idents existed. The Tyne Tees logo was last seen on production end boards until 2004, when they were replaced with, first an ITV logo, and then with an ITV Studios caption. Website contains examples of Tyne Tees endboards, gained from genuine video recordings. . Programming The station's founding executives George and Alfred Black used their theatrical background to produce a lot of light entertainment programming on Tyne Tees in the early years. One of the best known was The One O'Clock Show, a 40-minute variety show broadcast on weekdays. After 1,098 editions and more than five years on air, the final show was broadcast in March 1964. Some editions of The One O'Clock Show were produced by David Croft, who would go on to co-write many BBC situation comedies. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the Ned's Shed and Mary Goes to Market admags, as well as producing his first sitcom, Under New Management, set in a derelict pub in the North of England. The bulk of Tyne Tees' output has been its regional programming, consisting of news, current affairs and local interest. Its longest running news programme was Northern Life, which ran from 1976 to 1992. The main news show has been rebranded several times; the current version is ITV News Tyne Tees. Until December 2008, local-interest programming was usually broadcast at 19:30 on Thursdays, which are low-profile slots due to the high-rating EastEnders being broadcast at those times on BBC One. Local non-news programming was also broadcast on early Sunday evenings and various late slots following News at Ten on Tuesday and Thursday nights. Such documentaries concentrate upon local history, landscape and architecture, such as the various shows by John Grundy. A monthly political programme, Around the House, continues to be produced for the Tyne Tees and Border regions. Tyne Tees was obliged to contribute programming for the ITV network, although the bulk of network programming was purchased from the largest stations. Tyne Tees contributed game shows to the network, including Crosswits (1985-98) and Chain Letters (1987-97). Tyne Tees became a prolific producer of children's entertainment for the ITV network in the 1970s and 1980s. From the late 1970s, it produced series such as The Paper Lads, Quest of Eagles, Barriers and Andy Robson. This continued into the 1980s with Madabout, How Dare You!, Gilbert's Fridge and weekday pop-music show Razzamatazz, a pop programme that attracted many major recording artists to appear in a 17:15 slot. Tyne Tees also managed the production of Get Fresh, a Saturday morning show hosted in various weeks by different ITV regions. Super Gran, based on a series of books about a grandmother with superhuman powers, was also successful in the mid-1980s. With independent production company Festival Films and Television, Tyne Tees produced several adaptations of books by local novelist Catherine Cookson. The second dramatisation, The Black Velvet Gown, was the number one drama of 1991, winning an Emmy Award for best TV drama. Long-running soap opera Coronation Street was briefly produced at Tyne Tees' City Road studios in 1963 while all of the studios at the show's home, Granada Television in Manchester, were occupied by a production of the opera Orpheus in the Underworld. However, not all of the station's output has been successful. The 1997 soap opera Quayside was axed after 17 episodes after competing with the BBC's EastEnders. Tyne Tees has also produced a wide range of music programming. One of the first attempts at reaching the teenage audience was Young at Heart, hosted by Jimmy Savile and Valerie Masters in 1960. In 1979, Tyne Tees launched two national series, Alright Now and Check it Out, the latter a mix of rock music and segments on youth-oriented social issues; among performances by established acts, the two shows offered early exposure to bands linked to the North East, notably Dire Straits and The Police. The public entrance to Studio 5 at City Road gave The Tube its title. The most famous music show from the station, though, derived its name from the studios themselves. Produced for Channel 4, and first broadcast three days after the new station's launch in November 1982, The Tube acquired its name from the architecture of the public entrance to Studio 5, from where the show was broadcast, at the City Road complex. Under the direction of Gavin Taylor, The Tube filmed rock band Queen's 1986 Wembley concert for later broadcast and video and DVD release. Cameras bearing the Tyne Tees logo can be seen throughout the concert.Queen - The DVD Collection: Live At Wembley Stadium (Two Disc Set) [1986], dir. Gavin Taylor The Tube was dropped in 1987 as a result of falling audience figures and an incident involving Jools Holland, who cursed during a live trailer. A couple of months later, Tyne Tees launched another music show, this time for the ITV network. Whereas The Tube featured rock and punk bands and emerging musicians, Tyne Tees' The Roxy, concentrated on the mainstream UK singles chart. The show suffered, however, from not having a regular slot on the ITV network. Also, unlike The Tube, which had gained a loyal fanbase and respect from artists, mainstream acts were reluctant to travel to Newcastle for a three-minute performance when they could appear on the BBC's more established Top of the Pops in the more accessible London.

They were formerly grouped with the ioras and fairy-bluebirds in the family Irenidae. As presently defined, the leafbird family is monogeneric, with all species placed in the genus Chloropsis. Description The leafbirds range in size from , and in weight from . They resemble bulbuls, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colour, leafbirds are brightly plumaged, with the predominant green over the body giving rise to their common name. The family is mostly sexually dimorphic in their plumage, this can vary from the highly dimorphic orange- bellied leafbird to the Philippine leafbird, which exhibits no sexual dimorphism. Most of the differences between the sexes are in the extent of the other colours in the plumage, particularly in the colours around the head and the blue or black face mask, with females have less colour and a less extensive (or absent) mask. Some species have blue on the wings and tail. The plumage of juvenile birds is a duller version of the female's. To human ears, their songs are melodious, and several species are good mimics. The calls include whistles and chatters. Like bulbuls, leafbirds drop many body feathers when they are handled. This may confuse predators, especially snakes. Distribution and habitat Leafbirds are always found in trees and shrubs. Most are restricted to evergreen forests except the golden-fronted leafbird and Jerdon's leafbird which live in deciduous monsoon forests, and the orange- bellied leafbird, which occurs in deciduous forests. Within this requirement, they occupy all broadleaf forest types in the Indian Subcontinent and Southeast Asia. The highest altitude they occur at is 2500 m (8200 feet). Some species, such as the blue-masked leafbird, have montane distributions, rarely descending below 1000 m. The orange-bellied leafbird and the golden-fronted leafbird are amongst the more widespread species, with large ranges across mainland Asia. Some species have more restricted distributions, such as the yellow-throated leafbird, which is endemic to the Philippine island of Palawan, and the Bornean leafbird, restricted to northern Borneo. In general there are seldom more than three species occurring in the same area, although five species co-occur in the submontane forests of Sumatra. Co-occurring species are usually well-spaced on the spectrum of size, to reduce competition. Behaviour The yellow-throated leafbird is endemic to Palawan in the Philippines Leafbirds usually feed in the canopy, eating insects and some fruit and nectar. Prey is searched for by nimbly moving along the branch ends and gleaned. They are also capable of hover-gleaning to obtain prey, and will pursue flushed prey into the air or even as far as the forest floor. The extent to which the leafbirds consume nectar is a matter of some debate, records are more common in Southern Asia compared to South East Asia. Some species join mixed feeding flocks now and then; others defend the blooming and fruiting trees and bushes where they forage. Unlike most tropical Asian passerines, the nests of leafbirds are not located low down in the forest, but are instead found on the ends of branches near the tree crown. As such the nests of many species have rarely, if ever, been seen. The nests are open cups; of the few known, they are built of fine stems, leaf parts and rootlets. Some hang from thin horizontal shoots of trees; in others the rim is attached to a pair of vertical twigs. Females lay 2 or 3 pinkish eggs. The only information for incubation times come from captive birds, and incubation lasts around 14 days. Incubation is apparently performed only by the female, although in at least two species the male feeds the incubating females. Relationship with humans Leafbirds are attractive birds and, combined with an attractive song and capacity to mimic sounds, they have become very popular cagebirds. The majority of the trade in this family is confined to Asia. Some populations have been locally depleted by the massive numbers captured for the trade. Overall the eleven species are mostly still common in suitable habitat, although the amount of suitable habitat has declined greatly with deforestation. One species, the Philippine leafbird, is listed as vulnerable due to habitat loss. Another, the blue-masked leafbird, apparently never common anyway, is listed as near threatened.

It operated scheduled services from Mount Gambier to destinations in South Australia and Victoria. Its main base was Mount Gambier Airport, with a hub at Adelaide Airport, which serviced Mildura Airport and Port Augusta Airport. The airline also serviced Whyalla Airport until September 2007.  History  The airline was established and started operations in 1973. Beginning as a one-aeroplane flight school in South Australia, O'Connor Airlines developed, over some years, into a freight and passenger service flying to 18 regional and country centres across the state. This was to change when it lost the freight contact. It subsequently relaunched itself, rebasing in Mount Gambier, and began services from that city to Adelaide and Melbourne. The IATA Code OL was used up to 1990. It then started flying to Whyalla. It began to service the Victorian city of Mildura in 1998, purchasing a QantasLink route. In 2006, after Airlines of South Australia ceased operations, it began flying from Adelaide to Port Augusta. The airline used Qantas facilities at both Adelaide airport and Melbourne's Tullamarine airport. Originally, it used those of Australian Airlines. In November 2007 O'Connor Airline was placed into voluntary administration with debts of between $4‚Äì5m AUD. This was largely blamed on high maintenance costs and high competition. Administrators McGrath Nicol were at the time looking for a buyer of the service. O'Connor Airlines ceased operations on 14 December 2007 after its administrators were unable to find a buyer willing to purchase the airline as a going concern. On 21 February 2008, the airline's creditors voted for a pooled Deed of Company Arrangement (DoCA) for the airline group to be broken up and then commence trading again under new ownership. Many of the assets were subsequently purchased by Mount Gambier businessman Adrian de Bruin, including the Air Operator's Certificate, and used to establish de Bruin Air.

It has a visual magnitude of 9.9, making it too faint to be viewed with the unaided eye. It is named after Willem Jacob Luyten, who, in collaboration with Edwin G. Ebbighausen, first determined its high proper motion in 1935. The star has four confirmed planets, one of which (Luyten b) is in the circumstellar habitable zone. Properties This star is approximately a quarter the mass of the Sun and has 35% of the Sun's radius. Luyten's Star is at the maximum mass at which a red dwarf can be fully convective, which means that most if not all of the star forms an extended convection zone. It has a stellar classification of M3.5V, with the V luminosity class indicating this is a main-sequence star that is generating energy through the thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen at its core. The projected rotation rate of this starThis is denoted by v sin i, where v is the rotational velocity at the equator and i is the inclination to the line of sight. is too low to be measured, but is no greater than 1 km/s. Measurements of periodic variation in surface activity suggest a leisurely rotation period of roughly 116 days (which would give a velocity of ~0.15 km/s). The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is a relatively cool 3,150 K, giving the star the characteristic red-orange hue of an M-type star. At present, Luyten's Star is moving away from the Solar System. The closest approach occurred about 13,000 years ago when it came within 3.67 parsecs. The star is currently located 1.2 light years distant from Procyon, which would appear as a visual magnitude ‚àí4.5 star in the night sky of Luyten's Star's planets. The closest encounter between the two stars occurred about 600 years ago when Luyten's Star was at its minimal distance of about 1.12 ly from Procyon. The space velocity components of Luyten's Star are U = +16, V = ‚àí66 and W = ‚àí17 km/s. Planetary system In March 2017, two candidate planets were discovered orbiting Luyten's Star. The outer planet, GJ 273b, is a Super Earth in its star's habitable zone. It has a mass of 2.89 ¬± 0.26 Earth masses and orbits at a distance of 0.09110 ¬± 0.00002 AU, completing one orbital period in 18.650 ¬± 0.006 days. While the planet is on the innermost edge of the star's conservative habitable zone, the incident flux is only 1.06S‚äï, so it may be potentially habitable if water and an atmosphere are present; depending on albedo, its equilibrium temperature could be anywhere between 206 and 293 Kelvin. The inner planet, GJ 273c, is one of the lightest exoplanets detected by radial velocities, with a mass of only 1.18 ¬± 0.16 Earth masses. However, it orbits much further in, with an orbital period of only 4.7234 ¬± 0.00004 days. GJ 273b is one of the closest known planets in its star's habitable zone. In 2019, two more candidate planets were detected by radial velocity, making a total of four known planets in the system. In October 2017, \\"S√≥nar Calling GJ 273b\\", a project by Messaging Extraterrestrial Intelligence (METI) and S√≥nar, a music festival in Barcelona, transmitted a series of radio signals towards Luyten's star from a radar antenna at Ramfjordmoen, Norway. The signal consisted of a scientific and mathematical tutorial on how to decode the messages and was accompanied by 33 encoded musical compositions by various musicians. A second signal series was transmitted on May 14, 15, and 16, 2018. Were anyone listening, the soonest response would be received by 2036.

The 26th of July Movement later reformed along Marxist-Leninist lines, becoming the Communist Party in October 1965, and the government of Cuba later brought under its guise.\\"Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'\\" . Jason Beaubien. NPR. 1 January 2009. Retrieved 9 July 2013. The Cuban Revolution had powerful domestic and international repercussions. In particular, it transformed Cuba's relationship with the United States, although efforts to improve diplomatic relations have gained momentum in recent years (see the Cuban thaw). In the immediate aftermath of the revolution, Castro's government began a program of nationalization, centralization of the press and political consolidation that transformed Cuba's economy and civil society.Lazo, Mario (1970). American Policy Failures in Cuba ‚Äì Dagger in the Heart. Twin Circle Publishing Co.: New York. pp. 198‚Äì200, 204. Library of Congress Card Catalog Number: 68-31632. The revolution also heralded an era of Cuban intervention in foreign military conflicts in Africa, Latin America, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Several rebellions occurred in the six years following 1959 among the impoverished peasantry, mainly in the Escambray mountains, which were repressed by the Revolutionary government. Background =Politics of Cuba= In the decades following United States' invasion of Cuba in 1898, and formal independence from the U.S. on May 20, 1902, Cuba experienced a period of significant instability, enduring a number of revolts, coups and a period of U.S. military occupation. Fulgencio Batista, a former soldier who had served as the elected president of Cuba from 1940 to 1944, became president for the second time in 1952, after seizing power in a military coup and canceling the 1952 elections. Although Batista had been relatively progressive during his first term, in the 1950s he proved far more dictatorial and indifferent to popular concerns. While Cuba remained plagued by high unemployment and limited water infrastructure, Batista antagonized the population by forming lucrative links to organized crime and allowing American companies to dominate the Cuban economy, especially sugar-cane plantations and other local resources. Although the US armed and politically supported the Batista dictatorship, later US presidents recognized its corruption and the justifiability of removing it.New Republic, 14 Dec. 1963, Jean Daniel \\"Unofficial Envoy: An Historic Report from Two Capitals,\\" page 16 US President John F. Kennedy said: \\"I approved the proclamation which Fidel Castro made in the Sierra Maestra, when he justifiably called for justice and especially yearned to rid Cuba of corruption. I will even go further: to some extent it is as though Batista was the incarnation of a number of sins on the part of the United States. Now we shall have to pay for those sins. In the matter of the Batista regime, I am in agreement with the first Cuban revolutionaries.\\" =Opposition= During his first term as President, Batista had not been supported by the Communist Party of Cuba, and during his second term he became strongly anti-communist. Batista developed a rather weak security bridge as an attempt to silence political opponents. In the months following the March 1952 coup, Fidel Castro, then a young lawyer and activist, petitioned for the overthrow of Batista, whom he accused of corruption and tyranny. However, Castro's constitutional arguments were rejected by the Cuban courts. After deciding that the Cuban regime could not be replaced through legal means, Castro resolved to launch an armed revolution. To this end, he and his brother Ra√∫l founded a paramilitary organization known as \\"The Movement\\", stockpiling weapons and recruiting around 1,200 followers from Havana's disgruntled working class by the end of 1952. Batista was known as a corrupt leader and constantly pampered himself with exotic foods and elegant women. Early stages = Attack on Moncada Barracks = Striking their first blow against the Batista government, Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro gathered 69 Movement fighters and planned a multi-pronged attack on several military installations. On 26 July 1953, the rebels attacked the Moncada Barracks in Santiago and the barracks in Bayamo, only to be decisively defeated by government soldiers. It was hoped that the staged attack would spark a nationwide revolt against Batista's government. After an hour of fighting the rebel leader fled to the mountains. The exact number of rebels killed in the battle is debatable; however, in his autobiography, Fidel Castro claimed that nine were killed in the fighting, and an additional 56 were executed after being captured by the Batista government. Due to the government's large number of men, Hunt revised the number to be around 60 members taking the opportunity to flee to the mountains along with Castro. Among the dead was Abel Santamar√≠a, Castro's second-in-command, who was imprisoned, tortured, and executed on the same day as the attack. = Imprisonment and emigration = Numerous key Movement revolutionaries, including the Castro brothers, were captured shortly afterwards. In a highly political trial, Fidel spoke for nearly four hours in his defense, ending with the words \\"Condemn me, it does not matter. History will absolve me.\\" Castro's defense was based on nationalism, the representation and beneficial programs for the non-elite Cubans, and his patriotism and justice for the Cuban community. Fidel was sentenced to 15 years in the Presidio Modelo prison, located on Isla de Pinos, while Ra√∫l was sentenced to 13 years. However, in 1955, under broad political pressure, the Batista government freed all political prisoners in Cuba, including the Moncada attackers. Fidel's Jesuit childhood teachers succeeded in persuading Batista to include Fidel and Ra√∫l in the release. Soon, the Castro brothers joined with other exiles in Mexico to prepare for the overthrow of Batista, receiving training from Alberto Bayo, a leader of Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War. In June 1955, Fidel met the Argentine revolutionary Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara, who joined his cause. Raul and Castro's chief advisor Ernesto aided the initiation of Batista's amnesty. The revolutionaries named themselves the \\"26th of July Movement\\", in reference to the date of their attack on the Moncada Barracks in 1953. Student protests in Havana, 1956. = Student demonstrations = By late 1955, student riots and demonstrations became less common, and unemployment became problematic as new graduates could not find jobs. These protests were dealt with increasing repression. All young people were seen as possible revolutionaries.Invisible Latin America, by Samuel Shapiro, Ayer Publishing, 1963, , p. 77. Due to its continued opposition to the Cuban government and much protest activity taking place on its campus, the University of Havana was temporarily closed on November 30, 1956 (it did not reopen until 1959 under the first revolutionary government).Historia de Cuba: Desde Colon hasta Castro. Carlos M√°rquez Sterling. Miami, Florida. 1963. = Attack on Domingo Goicuria barracks = While the Castro brothers and the other July 26 Movement guerrillas were training in Mexico and preparing for their amphibious deployment to Cuba, another revolutionary group followed the example of the Moncada Barracks assault. On 29 April 1956 at 12:50 PM during Sunday mass, an independent guerrilla group of around 100 rebels led by Reynol Garcia attacked the Domingo Goicuria army barracks in Matanzas province. The attack was repelled with ten rebels and three soldiers killed in the fighting, and one rebel summarily executed by the garrison commander. Florida International University historian Miguel A. Brito was in the nearby cathedral when the firefight began. He writes, \\"That day, the Cuban Revolution began for me and Matanzas.\\" Escalating conflict Granma in late 1956, the rebels' stronghold in the Sierra Maestra, and Guevara and Cienfuegos' route towards Havana via Las Villas Province in December 1958 = Granma landing = The yacht Granma departed from Tuxpan, Veracruz, Mexico, on 25 November 1956, carrying the Castro brothers and 80 others including Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos, even though the yacht was only designed to accommodate 12 people with a maximum of 25. On December 2nd, it landed in Playa Las Coloradas, in the municipality of Niquero, arriving two days later than planned because the boat was heavily loaded, unlike during the practice sailing runs. This dashed any hopes for a coordinated attack with the llano wing of the Movement. After arriving and exiting the ship, the band of rebels began to make their way into the Sierra Maestra mountains, a range in southeastern Cuba. Three days after the trek began, Batista's army attacked and killed most of the Granma participants ‚Äì while the exact number is disputed, no more than twenty of the original eighty-two men survived the initial encounters with the Cuban army and escaped into the Sierra Maestra mountains. The group of survivors included Fidel and Ra√∫l Castro, Che Guevara and Camilo Cienfuegos. The dispersed survivors, alone or in small groups, wandered through the mountains, looking for each other. Eventually, the men would link up again ‚Äì with the help of peasant sympathizers ‚Äì and would form the core leadership of the guerrilla army. A number of female revolutionaries, including Celia Sanchez and Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a (the sister of Abel Santamaria), also assisted Fidel Castro's operations in the mountains. = Presidential palace attack = On 13 March 1957, a separate group of revolutionaries ‚Äì the anticommunist Student Revolutionary Directorate (RD) (Directorio Revolucionario Estudantil, DRE), composed mostly of students ‚Äì stormed the Presidential Palace in Havana, attempting to assassinate Batista and overthrow the government. The attack ended in utter failure. The RD's leader, student Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a, died in a shootout with Batista's forces at the Havana radio station he had seized to spread the news of Batista's anticipated death. The handful of survivors included Dr. Humberto Castello (who later became the Inspector General in the Escambray), Rolando Cubela and Faure Chomon (both later Commandantes of the 13 March Movement, centered in the Escambray Mountains of Las Villas Province). = Frank Pa√≠s's death and strike= On July 20, 1957 rebel leader Frank Pa√≠s was captured and killed in Santiago de Cuba during an intense and violent policing campaign. During his funeral, activists began marching through the city and raised a general strike. The strike would start skirmishes with the police and spread across various provinces that would last days. = Strengthening insurgency and United States involvement = The United States supplied Cuba with planes, ships, tanks and other tech such as napalm, which was used against the rebels. This would eventually come to an end due to a later arms embargo in 1958.Ernesto \\"Che\\" Guevara (World Leaders Past & Present), by Douglas Kellner, 1989, Chelsea House Publishers, , p. 45. According to Tad Szulc the United States began funding the 26th of July Movement around October or November of 1957 and ending around middle 1958. \\"No less than $50,000\\" would be delivered to key leaders of the 26th of July Movement. The purpose being to instill sympathies to the United States amongst the rebels in case the movement succeeded. Comandante William Alexander Morgan of the Second National Front of the Escambray While Batista increased troop deployments to the Sierra Maestra region to crush the 26 July guerrillas, the Second National Front of the Escambray kept battalions of the Constitutional Army tied up in the Escambray Mountains region. The Second National Front was led by former Revolutionary Directorate member Eloy Guti√©rrez Menoyo and the \\"Yanqui Comandante\\" William Alexander Morgan. Guti√©rrez Menoyo formed and headed the guerrilla band after news had broken out about Castro's landing in the Sierra Maestra, and Jos√© Antonio Echeverr√≠a had stormed the Havana Radio station. Though Morgan was dishonorably discharged from the U.S. Army, his recreating features from Army basic training made a critical difference in the Second National Front troops battle readiness.American Comandante , 2015 episode of American Experience Thereafter, the United States imposed an economic embargo on the Cuban government and recalled its ambassador, weakening the government's mandate further. Batista's support among Cubans began to fade, with former supporters either joining the revolutionaries or distancing themselves from Batista. Once Batista started making drastic decisions concerning Cuba's economy, he began to nationalize U.S oil refineries and other U.S properties. Nonetheless, the Mafia and U.S. businessmen maintained their support for the regime. Batista's government often resorted to brutal methods to keep Cuba's cities under control. However, in the Sierra Maestra mountains, Castro, aided by Frank Pa√≠s, Ramos Latour, Huber Matos, and many others, staged successful attacks on small garrisons of Batista's troops. Castro was joined by CIA connected Frank Sturgis who offered to train Castro's troops in guerrilla warfare. Castro accepted the offer, but he also had an immediate need for guns and ammunition, so Sturgis became a gunrunner. Sturgis purchased boatloads of weapons and ammunition from CIA weapons expert Samuel Cummings' International Armament Corporation in Alexandria, Virginia. Sturgis opened a training camp in the Sierra Maestra mountains, where he taught Che Guevara and other 26th of July Movement rebel soldiers guerrilla warfare. In addition, poorly armed irregulars known as escopeteros harassed Batista's forces in the foothills and plains of Oriente Province. The escopeteros also provided direct military support to Castro's main forces by protecting supply lines and by sharing intelligence. Ultimately, the mountains came under Castro's control. In addition to armed resistance, the rebels sought to use propaganda to their advantage. A pirate radio station called Radio Rebelde (\\"Rebel Radio\\") was set up in February 1958, allowing Castro and his forces to broadcast their message nationwide within enemy territory. Castro's affiliation with the New York Times journalist Herbert Matthews created a front page-worthy report on anti- communist propaganda. The radio broadcasts were made possible by Carlos Franqui, a previous acquaintance of Castro who subsequently became a Cuban exile in Puerto Rico. During this time, Castro's forces remained quite small in numbers, sometimes fewer than 200 men, while the Cuban army and police force had a manpower of around 37,000. Even so, nearly every time the Cuban military fought against the revolutionaries, the army was forced to retreat. An arms embargo ‚Äì imposed on the Cuban government by the United States on 14 March 1958 ‚Äì contributed significantly to the weakness of Batista's forces. The Cuban air force rapidly deteriorated: it could not repair its airplanes without importing parts from the United States. = Operation Verano = Batista finally responded to Castro's efforts with an attack on the mountains called Operation Verano, known to the rebels as la Ofensiva. The army sent some 12,000 soldiers, half of them untrained recruits, into the mountains, along with his own brother Raul. In a series of small skirmishes, Castro's determined guerrillas defeated the Cuban army. In the Battle of La Plata, which lasted from 11 to 21 July 1958, Castro's forces defeated a 500-man battalion, capturing 240 men while losing just three of their own. However, the tide nearly turned on 29 July 1958, when Batista's troops almost destroyed Castro's small army of some 300 men at the Battle of Las Mercedes. With his forces pinned down by superior numbers, Castro asked for, and received, a temporary cease-fire on 1 August. Over the next seven days, while fruitless negotiations took place, Castro's forces gradually escaped from the trap. By the 8 August, Castro's entire army had escaped back into the mountains, and Operation Verano had effectively ended in failure for the Batista government. =Rebel offensive= Map showing key locations in the Sierra Maestra during the 1958 stage of the Cuban Revolution On 21 August 1958, after the defeat of Batista's Ofensiva, Castro's forces began their own offensive. In the Oriente province (in the area of the present-day provinces of Santiago de Cuba, Granma, Guant√°namo and Holgu√≠n), Fidel Castro, Ra√∫l Castro and Juan Almeida Bosque directed attacks on four fronts. Descending from the mountains with new weapons captured during the Ofensiva and smuggled in by plane, Castro's forces won a series of initial victories. Castro's major victory at Guisa, and the successful capture of several towns including Maffo, Contramaestre, and Central Oriente, brought the Cauto plains under his control. Meanwhile, three rebel columns, under the command of Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos and Jaime Vega, proceeded westward toward Santa Clara, the capital of Villa Clara Province. Batista's forces ambushed and destroyed Jaime Vega's column, but the surviving two columns reached the central provinces, where they joined forces with several other resistance groups not under the command of Castro. When Che Guevara's column passed through the province of Las Villas, and specifically through the Escambray Mountains ‚Äì where the anticommunist Revolutionary Directorate forces (who became known as the 13 March Movement) had been fighting Batista's army for many months ‚Äì friction developed between the two groups of rebels. Nonetheless, the combined rebel army continued the offensive, and Cienfuegos won a key victory in the Battle of Yaguajay on 30 December 1958, earning him the nickname \\"The Hero of Yaguajay\\". = Battle of Santa Clara and Batista's flight = Che Guevara with Manuel Urrutia in 1959, who was president at the beginning of the revolution, after being appointed by the rebels. On 31 December 1958, the Battle of Santa Clara took place in a scene of great confusion. The city of Santa Clara fell to the combined forces of Che Guevara, Cienfuegos, and Revolutionary Directorate (RD) rebels led by Comandantes Rolando Cubela, Juan (\\"El Mejicano\\") Abrahantes, and William Alexander Morgan. News of these defeats caused Batista to panic. He fled Cuba by air for the Dominican Republic just hours later on 1 January 1959. Comandante William Alexander Morgan, leading RD rebel forces, continued fighting as Batista departed, and had captured the city of Cienfuegos by 2 January. Cuban General Eulogio Cantillo entered Havana's Presidential Palace, proclaimed the Supreme Court judge Carlos Piedra as the new President, and began appointing new members to Batista's old government.; . Castro learned of Batista's flight in the morning and immediately started negotiations to take over Santiago de Cuba. On 2 January, the military commander in the city, Colonel Rubido, ordered his soldiers not to fight, and Castro's forces took over the city. The forces of Guevara and Cienfuegos entered Havana at about the same time. They had met no opposition on their journey from Santa Clara to Cuba's capital. Castro himself arrived in Havana on 8 January after a long victory march. His initial choice of president, Manuel Urrutia Lle√≥, took office on 3 January. Aftermath Victorious rebels in the Havana Hilton, January 1959. =Relations with the United States= Fidel Castro and Che Guevara in 1962. The Cuban Revolution was a crucial turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations. Although the United States government was initially willing to recognize Castro's new government,Gleijeses, Piero (2002). Conflicting Missions: Havana, Washington and Africa, 1959‚Äì1976. University of North Carolina Press. p. 14. it soon came to fear that Communist insurgencies would spread through the nations of Latin America, as they had in Southeast Asia. Meanwhile, Castro's government resented the Americans for providing aid to Batista's government during the revolution. After the revolutionary government nationalized all U.S. property in Cuba in August 1960, the American Eisenhower administration froze all Cuban assets on American soil, severed diplomatic ties and tightened its embargo of Cuba.Gary B. Nash, Julie Roy Jeffrey, John R. Howe, Peter J. Frederick, Allen F. Davis, Allan M. Winkler, Charlene Mires and Carla Gardina Pestana. The American People, Concise Edition: Creating a Nation and a Society, Combined Volume (6th edition, 2007). New York: Longman. The Key West‚ÄìHavana ferry shut down. In 1961, the U.S. government backed an armed counterrevolutionary assault on the Bay of Pigs with the aim of ousting Castro, but the counterrevolutionaries were swiftly defeated by the Cuban military. The U.S. Embargo against Cuba ‚Äì the longest- lasting single foreign policy in American history ‚Äì is still in force as of 2020, although it underwent a partial loosening during the Obama Administration, only to be strengthened in 2017 under Trump. The U.S. began efforts to normalize relations with Cuba in the mid-2010s, and formally reopened its embassy in Havana after over half a century in August 2015. The Trump administration has reversed much of the Cuban Thaw by severely restricting travel by US citizens to Cuba and tightening the US government's 62-year-old embargo against the country. =Global influence= Castro's victory and post-revolutionary foreign policy had global repercussions as influenced by the expansion of the Soviet Union into Eastern Europe after the 1917 October Revolution. In line with his call for revolution in Latin America and beyond against imperial powers, laid out in his Declarations of Havana, Castro immediately sought to \\"export\\" his revolution to other countries in the Caribbean and beyond, sending weapons to Algerian rebels as early as 1960. In the following decades, Cuba became heavily involved in supporting Communist insurgencies and independence movements in many developing countries, sending military aid to insurgents in Ghana, Nicaragua, Yemen and Angola, among others. Castro's intervention in the Angolan Civil War in the 1970s and 1980s was particularly significant, involving as many as 60,000 Cuban soldiers.\\"La Guerras Secretas de Fidel Castro\\" (in Spanish). CubaMatinal.com. Retrieved 9 March 2013. =Relations with the Soviet Union= Following the American embargo, the Soviet Union became Cuba's main ally. The two Communist countries quickly developed close military and intelligence ties, culminating in the stationing of Soviet nuclear weapons in Cuba in 1962, an act which triggered the Cuban Missile Crisis. Cuba maintained close links to the Soviets until the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991. The end of Soviet economic aid and the loss of its trade partners in the Eastern Bloc led to an economic crisis and period of shortages known as the Special Period in Cuba. Characteristics =Ideology= Propaganda poster in Havana, 2012 At the time of the revolution various sectors of society supported the revolutionary movement from communists to business leaders and the Catholic Church. The beliefs of Fidel Castro during the revolution have been the subject of much historical debate. Fidel Castro was openly ambiguous about his beliefs at the time. Some orthodox historians argue Castro was a communist from the beginning with a long term plan; however, others have argued he had no strong ideological loyalties. Leslie Dewart has stated that there is no evidence to suggest Castro was ever a communist agent. Levine and Papasotiriou believe Castro believed in little outside of a distaste for American imperialism. While Ana Serra believed it was the publication of \\"El socialismo y el hombre en Cuba.\\" As evidence for his lack of communist leanings they note his friendly relations with the United States shortly after the revolution and him not joining the Cuban Communist Party during the beginning of his land reforms. At the time of the revolution the 26th of July Movement involved people of various political persuasions, but most were in agreement and desired the reinstatement of the 1940 Constitution of Cuba and supported the ideals of Jose Marti. Che Guevara commented to Jorge Masetti in an interview during the revolution that \\"Fidel isn't a communist\\" also stating \\"politically you can define Fidel and his movement as 'revolutionary nationalist'. Of course he is anti-American, in the sense that Americans are anti-revolutionaries\\". =Women's roles= Ra√∫l Castro, Vilma Esp√≠n, Jorge Risquet and Jos√© Nivaldo Causse in 1958 The importance of women's contributions to the Cuban Revolution is reflected in the very accomplishments that allowed the revolution to be successful, from the participation in the Moncada Barracks, to the Mariana Grajales all-women's platoon that served as Fidel Castro's personal security detail. Tete Puebla, second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, has said: Before the Mariana Grajales Platoon was established, the revolutionary women of the Sierra Maestra were not organized for combat and primarily helped with cooking, mending clothes, and tending to the sick, frequently acting as couriers, as well as teaching guerrillas to read and write.Puebla, Tet√©, and Mary-Alice Waters.

New York: Pathfinder, 2003 Hayd√©e Santamar√≠a and Melba Hernandez were the only women who participated in the attack on the Moncada Barracks, afterward acting alongside Natalia Revuelta, and Lidia Castro (Fidel Castro's sister) to form alliances with anti-Batista organizations, as well as the assembly and distribution of \\"History Will Absolve Me\\".Shayne, Julie D. The Revolution Question: Feminisms in El Salvador, Chile, and Cuba. Rutgers University Press, 2004. Celia Sanchez and Vilma Espin were leading strategists and highly skilled combatants who held essential roles throughout the revolution. Tete Puebla, founding member and second in command of the Mariana Grajales Platoon, said of Celia Sanchez, \\"When you speak of Celia, you've got to speak of Fidel, and vice versa.

The incident occurred after the town was occupied by the IDF's 89th Commando Battalion during Operation Yoav, encountering little resistance. The battalion, whose first commander was Moshe Dayan, was composed of former Irgun and Lehi forces. Benny Morris has estimated that hundreds of people were killed. Lieutenant-General John Bagot Glubb, the British commander of Jordan's Arab Legion stated the numbers were much smaller, citing a UN report for a figure of 30 women and children killed.Sir John Bagot Glubb, A Soldier with the Arabs, London 1957, pp. 211-212.\\"On October 31st, United Nations observers reported that the Israelis had killed thirty women and children at Dawaima (Dawayima), west of Hebron. It would be an exaggeration to claim that great numbers were massacred. But just enough were killed, or roughly handled, to make sure that all the civilian population took flight, thereby leaving more and more land vacant for future Jewish settlement. These particular villages west of Hebron were to remain vacant and their lands uncultivated for eight years.\\" A follow- up report delivered to the United Nations by a delegation from the Arab Refugee Congress reported that the Arab Legion had had an interest in underplaying the extent of the massacre, which was, it claimed, worse than the Deir Yassin massacre, in order to avoid further panic and refugee flight.'The Dawaymeh Massacre,' United Nations Conciliation Commission for Palestine Technical Committee, United Nations A/AC.25/Com.Tech/W.3, 14 June 1949.'The reason why so little is known about this massacre which, in many respects, was more brutal than the Deir Yassin massacre, is because the Arab Legion (the Army in control of that area) feared that if the news was allowed to spread, it would have the same effect on the moral of the peasantry that Deir Yassin had, namely to cause another flow of Arab refugees.' The village mukhtar Hassan Mahmoud Ihdeib, in a sworn statement, estimated the number of victims as 145.Jonathan Ofir, 'The Mukhtar‚Äôs sworn testimony,' Mondoweiss, February 12, 2016.

He stated that no call to surrender was announced, and that no resistance took place. Firing began at a distance of 1/2 kilometer as the semi-circular arc of forces closed in. The Israeli troops fired indiscriminately for over an hour, during which time many fled, and two Palestinian groups took refuge respectively in the Mosque and a nearby cave called Iraq El Zagh. On returning the day with other villagers, 60 bodies were found in the mosque, mostly of elderly men. Numerous corpses of men, women and children, lay in the streets. 80 bodies of men, women and children were then found in the entrance of the Iraq El Zagh cavern. On making a census, it emerged that 455 persons were missing, 280 men, and the remainder women and children. =The event according to Benny Morris= The letter by Kaplan was published in full in Haaretz in February 2016. Translation: The original of the letter was removed from the archive where it has previously been available. Benny Morris writes: The soldier-witness, according to Kaplan, said From the sworn Statement given by the Mukhtar of Dawaymeh village, Hassan Mahmaod Ihdeib. Morris has estimated \\"hundreds\\" of people were killed, he also reports on the IDF investigation, which concluded around 100 villagers had been killed, and cites an account by a Mapam member, based on an interview with an Israeli soldier, who reported 80 to 100 men, women and children killed.Benny Morris (2004), The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited, p. 469.Benny Morris (2008), 1948: A History the First Arab-Israeli War, p. 333.

The massacre took place when the expected wave of flight failed to take place. He also adds that Amos Kenan, who had participated in the Deir Yassin massacre, took part in the assault.Ilan Pappe, The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine,(2007)Oneowlrd Publications 2011 pp.195-198. The UN inspection team Members of the 89th Battalion outside Beit Gurvin, during Operation Yoav, October 1948 Members of the 89th Battalion during Operation Yoav, October 1948 Yigal Allon cabled G√©n√©ral Yitzhak Sadeh to check \\"the 'rumours' that the 89th Battalion had 'killed many tens of prisoners on the day of the conquest of al-Dawayima', and to respond\\".Morris, 2004, pp. 469-471 On the 5 November probably worried about a UN investigation Allon then ordered Sadeh to instruct the unit: Although unbeknownst to Allon, the 89th had cleaned up the site of the massacre on 1 November 1948.Morris, 2004, p. 495. endnote 49 On 7 November, UN inspectors visited the scene of the village to investigate accusations of a massacre, the accusation being made by the Egyptians and refugees from the village. The team found \\"several demolished buildings and one corpse but no other physical evidence of a massacre\\". The UN team did however take a witness statement from the village mukhtar Isser Be'eri, the commander of the IDF intelligence service, who conducted an independent investigation, concluded that 80 people had been killed during the occupation of Al-Dawayima and that 22 had been captured and executed subsequently. Be'eri recommended prosecution of the platoon OC, who had confessed to the massacre, but notwithstanding his recommendations no one was put on trial or punished. On 14 November the Israeli cabinet instructed Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion to also launch an investigation. Its findings remain secret. Reactions The American consul in Jerusalem, William Burdett, who had received news about the massacre reported on November 16 to Washington \\"Investigation by UN indicates massacre occurred but observers are unable to determine number of persons involved.\\" News of the massacre reached village communities in the western Hebron and Judean foothills \\"possibly precipitating further flight\\".

This medium-sized cat is characterized by solid black spots and streaks on its coat, round ears, and white neck and undersides. It weighs between and reaches at the shoulders. It was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. Two subspecies are recognized: L. p. pardalis and L. p. mitis. Typically active during twilight and at night, the ocelot tends to be solitary and territorial. It is efficient at climbing, leaping and swimming. It preys on small terrestrial mammals, such as armadillo, opossum and lagomorphs. Both sexes become sexually mature at around two years of age; they can breed throughout the year, though the peak mating season varies geographically. After a gestation period of two to three months, the female gives birth to a litter of one to three kittens. They stay with their mother for up to two years, after which they leave to establish their own territories. The ocelot prefers areas with dense vegetation cover, high prey availability, and proximity to water sources. It is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, and is threatened by habitat destruction, hunting and traffic accidents. Populations are decreasing in many parts of its range. The association of the ocelot with humans dates back to the Aztec and Incan civilizations; it has occasionally been owned as a pet.  Etymology  The name \\"ocelot\\" comes from the Nahuatl word (), which generally refers to the jaguar rather than the ocelot. Another possible origin for the name is the Latin (\\"having little eyes\\" or \\"marked with eye-like spots\\"), in reference to the cat's spotted coat. Other vernacular names for the ocelot include (Venezuela), (Argentina), (Panama), (Suriname), (Brazil), (Costa Rica, Panama and Venezuela), (Brazil), , , , , (Belize), (Bolivia) and (Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala and Peru).  Taxonomy  Felis pardalis was the scientific name proposed for the ocelot by Carl Linnaeus in 1758. The genus Leopardus was proposed by John Edward Gray in 1842 for several spotted cat skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum, London. Several ocelot specimens were described in the 19th and 20th centuries, including: *Felis mitis by Fr√©d√©ric Cuvier in 1824 was a specimen from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. *F. chibi-gouazou by Edward Griffith in 1827 was based on earlier descriptions and illustrations. *Leopardus griseus by John Edward Gray in 1842 was a spotted cat skin from Central America. *F. pseudopardalis by Pierre Boitard in 1845 was an ocelot kept in the Jardin des plantes. *F. melanura by Robert Ball in 1844 was a specimen from British Guiana. *F. albescens by Jacques Pucheran in 1855 was a specimen from Brownsville, Texas. *F. aequatorialis by Edgar Alexander Mearns in 1903 was a skin of an adult female ocelot from Talamanca canton in Costa Rica. *F. maripensis and F. sanctaemartae by Joel Asaph Allen in 1904 were skins of two adult female ocelots from Maripa, Venezuela and Santa Marta district in Colombia, respectively. *F. pardalis pusaea by Oldfield Thomas in 1914 was an ocelot skin and skull from Guayas Province in coastal Ecuador. *F. pardalis nelsoni and F. p. sonoriensis by Edward Alphonso Goldman in 1925 as subspecies of F. pardalis, based on specimens from Manzanillo and the Mayo River region respectively in Mexico. *L. pardalis steinbachi by Reginald Innes Pocock in 1941 was a specimen from Buena Vista, Ichilo in Bolivia. = Subspecies = In 1919, Allen reviewed the specimens described until 1914, placed them into the genus Leopardus and recognized nine subspecies as valid taxa based on the colors and spot patterns of skins. In 1941, Pocock reviewed dozens of ocelot skins in the collection of the Natural History Museum and regrouped them to nine different subspecies, also based on their colors and spots. Later authors recognized 10 subspecies as valid. In 1998, results of a mtDNA control region analysis of ocelot samples indicated that four major ocelot groups exist, one each in Central America, northwestern South America, northeastern South America and southern South America south of the Amazon River. A 2010 study of morphological features noted significant differences in the size and color of the Central and South American populations, suggesting they could be separate species. In 2013, a study of craniometric variation and microsatellite diversity in ocelots throughout the range recognized three subspecies: L. p. albescens from the Texas‚ÄìMexico border, L. p. pardis from Central America and L. p. pseudopardalis from South America, though L. p. mitis may comprise the ocelot population in the southern part of South America. In 2017, the Cat Classification Task Force of the IUCN Cat Specialist Group noted that up to four subspecies can be identified, but recognized only two as valid taxa. These two taxa differ in morphological features and are geographically separated by the Andes: *L. p. pardalis has a greyish fur. Its range extends from Texas and Arizona to Costa Rica. *L. p. mitis has a more yellowish fur and is larger than pardalis. It occurs in South America as far south as northern Argentina. = Phylogeny = Results of a phylogenetic study indicate that the Leopardus lineage genetically diverged from the Felidae around 8 million years ago (mya). The ocelot is estimated to have diverged from the margay (Leopardus wieldii) between 2.41 and 1.01 mya. The relationships of the ocelot within the Felidae is considered as follows:  Characteristics  Close view of an ocelot The ocelot's fur is extensively marked with solid black markings on a creamy, tawny, yellowish, reddish gray or gray background color. The spots on the head and limbs are small, but markings on the back, cheeks and flanks are open or closed bands and stripes. A few dark stripes run straight from the back of the neck up to the tip of the tail. Its neck and undersides are white, the insides of the legs are marked with a few horizontal streaks. Its round ears are marked with a bright white spot. Each ocelot has a unique color pattern which can be used to identify specific individuals. Its fur is short, about long on the belly, but with about long guard hairs on the back. It has 28 to 30 teeth, with the dental formula . Its eyes are brown but reflect golden when illuminated. The body has a notably strong odor. The ocelot is a medium-sized cat with a head-and-body length of between and a tail. It typically reaches at the shoulder. The weight of females ranges between and of males between . Its footprint measures nearly . The ocelot can be easily confounded with the margay (Leopardus wiedii) and the oncilla (L. tigrinus), though the ocelot is noticeably larger and heavier with a shorter tail. Though all three have rosettes on their coats, the ocelot typically has a more blotched pattern; the oncilla has dark spots on its underbelly unlike the other two. Other differences lie in the facial markings, appearance of the tail and fur characteristics. The ocelot is similar in size to a bobcat (Lynx rufus), though larger individuals have occasionally been recorded. The jaguar is notably larger and heavier, and has rosettes instead of spots and stripes.  Distribution and habitat  Two ocelots, mother and daughter, in a wooded area of the Pantanal wetlands; at night, they encounter fewer humans on this farm. The ocelot ranges from the southwestern United States to northern Argentina, up to an elevation of . It inhabits tropical forests, thorn forests, mangrove swamps and savannas. A 2019 study in the Brazilian Amazon showed that it prefers habitats with good availability of prey and water, and tends to avoid other predators. It favors areas with dense forest cover and water sources, far from roads and human settlement, avoiding steep slopes and highly elevated areas due to lack of prey. In areas where ocelots coexist with larger predators such as the cougar and human beings, they may tune their active hours to avoid them, and seek dense cover to avoid competitors. It can adapt well to its surroundings; as such, factors other than the aforementioned are not significant in its choice of habitat. It shares a large part of its range with the jaguar, jaguarundi, margay, oncilla and cougar.  Ecology and behavior  Ocelots rest on trees during the day. The ocelot is usually solitary and active mainly during twilight and at night. Radio collared individuals in the Cocha Cashu Biological Station in Peru rested during the day and became active earliest in the late afternoon; they moved between 3.2 and 17 hours until dawn and then returned to their dens. During the daytime, it rests on trees, in dens below large trees or other cool, sheltered sites on the ground. It is agile in climbing and leaping, and escapes predators by jumping on trees. It is also an efficient swimmer. It scent-marks its territory by spraying urine. The territories of males are large, while those of females cover . Territories of females rarely overlap, whereas the territory of a male includes those of two to three females. Social interaction between sexes is minimal, though a few adults have been observed together even in non-mating periods, and some juveniles interact with their parents. Data from camera trapping studies confirm that several ocelot individuals deposit scat in one or several communal sites, called latrines. The ocelot can be aggressive in defending its territory, fighting even to death. The population density of ocelots has been observed to be high in areas with high rainfall, and tend to decrease with increasing latitude; highest densities have been recorded in the tropics. In 2014, the ocelot population density in Barro Colorado Island was estimated to be , greater than recorded in northwestern Amazon in Peru in 2010, which was the densest ocelot population recorded thus far. Predators of the ocelot in Texas include the bobcat, cougar, coyote, large raptors, feral dogs and pigs, American alligator, pit viper and human beings. = Hunting and diet = The ocelot is a carnivore and primarily active during twilight and at night Ocelots have been observed to follow scent trails to acquire prey. They walk slowly at a speed of about searching for prey. Alternatively, an ocelot may wait for prey for 30 to 60 minutes at a certain site, and move to another walking at if unsuccessful. An ocelot typically prefers hunting in areas with vegetation cover, avoiding open areas, especially on moonlit nights, so as not to be seen by the prey. As a carnivore it preys on small terrestrial mammals such as rodents, lagomorphs, armadillos, opossums, and also fish, insects, reptiles and small birds. It usually feeds on the kill immediately, but removes bird feathers before. It typically preys on animals that weigh less than , but rarely targets large animals such as deer and peccaries. An ocelot requires of food every day to satisfy its energy requirements. Primates prevail in the diet of ocelots in southeastern Brazil, and iguanas in a tropical deciduous forest in Mexico. The composition of the diet varies by season; in Venezuela, ocelots were found to prefer iguanas and rodents in the dry season and then switch to land crabs in the wet season. In southeastern Brazil, ocelots have a similar prey preference as margays and oncillas. The oncillas focus on tree-living marsupials and birds while the margays are not as selective. = Reproduction = An ocelot kitten Both male and female ocelots produce a long-range \\"yowl\\" in the mating season as well as a short-range \\"meow\\". Ocelots can mate any time during the year. The peak mating season varies geographically; in Argentina and Paraguay peaks have been observed in autumn, and in Mexico and Texas in autumn and winter. Oestrus lasts four to five days, and recurs every 25 days in a non-pregnant female. A study in southern Brazil showed that sperm production in ocelots, margays and oncillas peaks in summer. Captive ocelots spend more time together when mating; both scent-mark extensively and eat less during this time. Breeding ocelots in captivity is often difficult. A litter of one to three is born after a gestational period of two to three months. Females give birth in dens, usually located in dense vegetation. A newborn kitten weighs . The kitten is born with spots and stripes, though on a gray background; the color changes to golden as the ocelot grows older. A study in southern Texas revealed that a mother keeps a litter in a den for 13 to 64 days, and shifts the young to two or three dens. The kitten's eyes open 15 to 18 days after birth. Kittens begin to leave the den at the age of three months. They remain with their mother for up to two years, and then start dispersing and establishing their own territory. In comparison to other felids, ocelots have a relatively longer duration between births and a narrow litter size. Captive ocelots live for up to 20 years.  Threats  The ocelot is threatened by hunting for its skins Throughout its range, the ocelot is threatened by loss and fragmentation of habitat. In Texas, the fertile land that supports dense cover and constitutes the optimum habitat for the ocelot is being lost to agriculture. The habitat is often fragmented into small pockets that cannot support ocelots well, leading to deaths due to starvation. Traffic accidents have emerged as a major threat over the years as ocelots try to expand beyond their natural habitat to new areas and get hit by vehicles. In the Atlantic Forest in northeastern Argentina, it is affected by logging and poaching of prey species. The fur trade was a flourishing business in the 1960s and the 1970s that resulted in severe exploitation of felids such as the ocelot and the jaguar. In the 1960s, ocelot skins were among the most highly preferred in the US, reaching an all- time high of 140,000 skins traded in 1970. This was followed by prohibitions on commercial trade of spotted cat skins in several range states such as Brazil and the US, causing ocelot skins in trade to plummet. In 1986, the European Economic Community banned import of ocelot skins, and in 1989, the ocelot was included in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. However, hunting of ocelots for skins has continued and is still a major threat to ocelot survival. Another threat has been the international pet trade; this typically involves capturing ocelot kittens by killing their mothers; these cats are then sold to tourists. Though it is banned in several countries, pet trade survives; in some areas of Central and South America ocelots are still sold in a few local markets.  Conservation status  The ocelot is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List because of its wide distribution in the Americas. As of 2013, the global population was estimated at more than 40,000 mature individuals, with stable populations in some Amazon basin areas. As of 2012, the ocelot population in Argentina's subtropical regions was estimated to consist of 1,500 to 8,000 mature individuals. It has been recorded in oil palm landscapes and big cattle ranches in the Colombian Llanos and inter-Andean valleys. In Texas and northeastern Mexico, ocelot populations have reduced drastically; as of 2014, the population in Texas is estimated to be 50‚Äì80 individuals. The reduced numbers have led to increased inbreeding and low genetic diversity. Ocelot hunting has been banned in Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia, Colombia, Costa Rica, French Guiana, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, United States, Uruguay, and Venezuela; regulations have been placed on hunting in Peru. The US Fish and Wildlife Service, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department and The Nature Conservancy are among agencies actively involved in ocelot conservation efforts, such as the protection and regeneration of vegetation in the Rio Grande Valley. = In captivity = The American Zoo and Aquarium Association established a Species Survival Plan for the Brazilian ocelot. In 2006, the captive population in North American zoos consisted of 16 ocelots representing six founders and their offspring. Some litters were produced using artificial insemination. The Emperor Valley Zoo in Trinidad keeps foremost confiscated and trapped ocelots.  In culture  Moche ceramic bottle in the shape of an ocelot, Mus√©e d'ethnographie de Gen√®ve, Switzerland Ocelots have been associated with humans since the time of the Aztec and Incan civilizations, who depicted ocelots in their art and mythology. Ocelot bones were made into thin, pointed instruments to pierce ears and limbs for ritual bloodletting. Several figurines depicting ocelots and similar felids are known. In her 1904 work A Penitential Rite of the Ancient Mexicans, archaeologist Zelia Nuttall described a statue depicting an ocelot or a tiger excavated in Mexico City and its relation to the Aztec deity Tezcatlipoca. She argued that the sculpture depicted an ocelot, writing, Salvador Dal√≠ with his pet ocelot Babou Moreover, she described a photograph of a seated person to corroborate her claim: Like many other felids, ocelots are occasionally kept as pets. Mindy Stinner (of the Conservators Center, Burlington) notes that ocelots, unlike caracals and servals, might demand a lot of attention from their owners. They have a tendency to chew on or suck on objects, such as fabric and the fingers of their owners; this can lead them to accidentally ingest objects like tennis balls. Agile and playful, pet ocelots can be troublesome to keep due to their habit of leaping around and potentially damaging objects; ocelots may unintentionally injure their owners from bites. Nevertheless, carefully raised ocelots can be highly affectionate to their owners. Painter Salvador Dal√≠ owned a pet ocelot named Babou that was seen with him at many places he visited, including a voyage aboard SS France. When one of the diners at a New York restaurant was alarmed by the ocelot, Dali told her that it was a common domestic cat that he had \\"painted over in an op art design\\". Opera singer Lily Pons and musician Gram Parsons are also known to have owned ocelots.

Includes defunct groups. The Laestadian Lutheran Church (LLC) is a religious Christian movement, its teachings based on the Bible and the Lutheran Confessions. From June 9, 1973, the organisation was named the Association of American Laestadian Congregations (AALC), before the association changed its name in 1994 in order better to convey its spiritual heritage. , the Laestadian Lutheran Church has 33 member congregations in the United States and Canada, with highest concentrations of members in Minnesota, Washington, Arizona, Michigan in the United States and in Saskatchewan, Canada; the congregations are served by about 90 ministers, nearly all of them lay preachers. In Northern Europe, the association's sister organizations are the Conservative Laestadians' Central Association of the Finnish Associations of Peace (') in Finland, the Sveriges fridsf√∂reningarnas centralorganisation in Sweden, and the Estonian Lutheran Association of Peace ('). The main teaching among them is of Jesus' suffering, death, and resurrection. The work of Jesus Christ continues in this world as the work of the Holy Spirit. The Laestadian Lutheran Church teaches of God's kingdom and the need for repentance and the forgiveness of sins. The church holds, in accord with the Lutheran Confessions, that the Bible is the highest guide and authority for Christian faith, doctrine, and life. The norms in the congregation such as refraining from birth-control, make-up, and dancing, are some of the things members do not feel are right to do as a child of God. The Laestadian Lutheran Church takes its name from Martin Luther and Lars Levi Laestadius. Laestadius was a Lutheran pastor who served in northern Sweden from 1825 to 1861. The movement reached North America with Finnish immigrants in the 1860s. Congregations were first formally organized in Cokato, Minnesota, in 1872 and Calumet, Michigan, in 1873. The Laestadian movement in North America has suffered a number of schisms since 1890. The subjects of disagreement have mainly been the understanding of justification, God's congregation, and the sacraments. The last division occurred in 1973 and resulted in the establishment of the Laestadian Lutheran Church.

On account of earlier editorial tendencies, the two poetical works, Solomon and Saturn I and Solomon and Saturn II, have often been read as a single, continuous poem. They are considered some of the most enigmatic and difficult poems of the Old English corpus. Prose Solomon and Saturn The so-called Prose Solomon and Saturn in the Nowell Codex (the Beowulf manuscript) is a question-and-answer text dealing chiefly with issues of biblical or Christian lore. It shares much similarity with the later Old English prose dialogue Adrian and Ritheus and, later still, the Middle English Master of Oxford's Catechism. Poetic versions =Themes= Solomon and Saturn I, Solomon and Saturn II, and the Pater Noster Solomon and Saturn in MS Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (CCCC) 422 are often compared to the Vaf√ær√∫√∞nism√°l and Alv√≠ssm√°l and other similar poems in the Poetic Edda. The poetic versions have been cited as an example of orientalism with the suggestion that it screens anxieties about the cultural identity of the English people. Kathryn Powell claims that at the time it was preserved in Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, Anglo-Saxon England was beset by anxieties about the acquisition and dissemination of knowledge, the stability of the kingdom and the efficacy of religious faith. She argues that by displacing ignorance, political instability and lack of faith onto the Eastern and pagan Chaldean people as represented by Saturn, English people were encouraged to identify with ideals and behaviours of the Christianised figure of Solomon. This is cited as an example of bolstering English Christian culture through degrading the east.Kathryn Powell , 'Orientalist fantasy in the poetic dialogues of Solomon and Saturn', Anglo-Saxon England 34 (2005), 117-143 Cambridge University Press =Date= As with most Old English poetry, the Solomon and Saturn poems have proven notoriously difficult to date. Patrick O'Neill has argued for a connection to the court of King Alfred in the ninth century,Patrick O'Neill, 'On the date, provenance and relationship of the ‚ÄòSolomon and Saturn‚Äô dialogues', Anglo-Saxon England 26 (1997), 139-168. whereas Daniel Anlezark sees the poem as fitting into the mid-tenth-century cultural milieu of Dunstan's Glastonbury. The Solomon and Saturn texts are often considered the earliest forms of a wider European literary tradition that comprises similar works such as the dialogue between Solomon and Marcolf. =Solomon and Saturn I= Solomon and Saturn I is one of the few Old English poems to survive in more than one manuscript. It appears in MS CCCC 41 and MS CCCC 422. Along with the Pater Noster Solomon and Saturn, Solomon and Saturn I contains runes as a sort of riddling shorthand in which runic characters stand for the words in Old English that name them. From this, we know some of the names for the extended set of runes used to write Old English. The prose version has as one of its riddles: \\"Who invented letters? Mercurius the giant\\". The Anglo-Saxons routinely identified Mercury with Woden (known in Old Norse as √ì√∞inn, and widely today as Odin), who gave his name to Wednesday.J. S. Ryan \\"Othin in England: Evidence from the Poetry for a Cult of Woden in Anglo-Saxon England Folklore, Vol. 74, No. 3. (Autumn, 1963), pp. 460-480. See p.476. =Solomon and Saturn II= Solomon and Saturn II, which is often regarded as having more aesthetic merit, contains a number of riddles, including two of the most obscure passages in Old English literature: the weallande Wulf and Vasa Mortis riddles. Weallende Wulf Saturn's first riddle describes a dragon slayer named Wulf and the waste land that arises after his death. The poem's earlier editor, Robert Menner, argued that the weallende Wulf passage ultimately stems from ancient Hebrew legends regarding Nimrod and the builders of the Tower of Babel. He interprets Wulf as the Babylonian god Bel, who is connected to Saturn in Isidore's Etymologies. Andy Orchard has found similarities between Wulf and Beowulf.Andy Orchard, Pride and Prodigies, pp. 82-5 And Daniel Anlezark has found the passage to participate in an \\"Avernian tradition\\", which describes impassable waste lands of Antiquity.Anlezark, \\"Poisoned places\\" Tristan Major has suggested that the passage is an orientalist conflation of biblical and classic material, and that Wulf is to be identified with the mythological Perseus.Major, \\"Saturn's first riddle\\" Vasa Mortis The riddle describes a mysterious bird that will be bound until Doomsday; it has been bound by Solomon and is feared by the leaders of the Philistines. The final line of the passage names the bird as Vasa Mortis. Robert Menner has argued that ancient Jewish origins on Solomon's struggles with demons are at the heart of the Old English riddle; he identifies the Vasa Mortis with the demon Asmodeus.Menner, \\"The Vasa Mortis passage\\" Cilluffo sees parallels between the Vasa Mortis and the description of Fame in Virgil's Aeneid, as well as the nocturnal monster in the Anglo- Saxon Liber monstrorum and the griffin in the Wonders of the East.Cilluffo, \\"Mirabilia ags.\\" References Bibliography =Editions= *Anlezark, Daniel, The Old English Dialogues of Solomon and Saturn, Anglo-Saxon Texts 7, Cambridge, 2009. *Cross, James E. and Hill, Thomas D., The 'Prose Solomon and Saturn' and 'Adrian and Ritheus', Toronto, 1982. *Dobbie, Elliott van Kirk, Anglo-Saxon Minor Poems, Anglo-Saxon Poetic Records 6, New York, 1942. *Kemble, John M., The Dialogue of Salomon and Saturnus, London, 1848. *Menner, R.J., The Poetical Dialogues of Solomon and Saturn, MLA Monograph Series 13, New York, 1941. =Scholarship= *Anlezark, Daniel. \\"Poisoned places: the Avernian tradition in Old English poetry.\\" Anglo-Saxon England 36 (2007): 103-126. *Cilluffo, Gilda. \\"Mirabilia ags.: il Vasa Mortis nel Salomone e Saturno.\\" Annali Istituto Universitario Orientale di Napoli Filologia germanica 24 (1981): 211-226. *Dane, Joseph A. \\"The structure of the old English Solomon and Saturn II.\\" Neophilologus 64.4 (1980): 592-603. *Major, Tristan. \\"Saturn‚Äôs First Riddle in Solomon and Saturn II: An Orientalist Conflation.\\" Neophilologus 96 (2012): 301-313. *Menner, R.J. \\"The Vasa Mortis Passage in the Old English Salomon and Saturn.\\" In Studies in English Philology in Honor of F.

For those who want a non-hereditary head of state, the method by which one should be chosen is not agreed upon, with some favouring an elected president, some an appointed head of state with little power. Others support something akin to the Swiss model, with a directorate functioning as a collective head of state. Monarchy has been the form of government used in the countries that now make up the United Kingdom since the Middle Ages. However, a republican government existed in England and Wales, later along with Ireland and Scotland, in the mid-17th century as a result of the Parliamentarian victory in the English Civil War. The Commonwealth of England, as the period was called, lasted from the execution of Charles I in 1649 until the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. The main lobby group that campaigns for the abolition of the monarchy is Republic. Context Within Britain, republican sentiment has largely focused on the abolition of the British monarch, rather than the dissolution of the British Union or independence for its constituent countries. In Northern Ireland, the term \\"republican\\" is usually used in the sense of Irish republicanism. While also against monarchical forms of government, Irish republicans are against the presence of the British state in any form in Ireland and advocate creating a united Ireland, an all-island state comprising the whole of Ireland. Unionists who support a British republic also exist in Northern Ireland. There are republican members of the Scottish National Party (SNP) in Scotland and Plaid Cymru in Wales who advocate independence for those countries as republics. The SNP's official policy is that the British monarch would remain head of state of an independent Scotland, unless the people of Scotland decided otherwise. Plaid Cymru have a similar view for Wales, although its youth wing, Plaid Ifanc, has an official policy advocating a Welsh republic. The Scottish Socialist Party and the Scottish Greens both support an independent Scottish republic. History Since the 1970s, early modern English republicanism has been extensively studied by historians, to the point where monarchism and absolutism have now become neglected fields. James Harrington (1611‚Äì1677) is generally considered to be the most representative republican writer of the era. =Cromwellian Commonwealth= The countries that now make up the United Kingdom, together with the present Republic of Ireland, were briefly ruled as a republic in the 17th century, first under the Commonwealth consisting of the Rump Parliament and the Council of State (1649‚Äì1653) and then under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell and later his son Richard (1653‚Äì1659), and finally under the restored Rump Parliament (1659-60). The Commonwealth Parliament represented itself as a Republic on the classical model, with John Milton writing an early defense of republicanism in the idiom of constitutional limits on a monarch's power. Cromwell's Protectorate was less ideologically republican and was seen by Cromwell as restoring the mixed constitution of monarchy, aristocracy and democracy found in classical literature and English common law discourse. First the Kingdom of England was declared to be the Commonwealth of England and then Scotland and Ireland were briefly forced into union with England by the army. This decision was later reversed when the monarchy was restored in 1660. In 1707 the Act of Union between England and Scotland was signed; the two countries' parliaments became one, and in return Scotland was granted access to the English overseas possessions. A Dutch satirical view of Cromwell as a usurper of monarchical power Many of Cromwell's actions upon gaining power were decried as \\"harsh, unwise, and tyrannical\\". He and General Thomas Fairfax were often ruthless in putting down the mutinies which occurred within their own army towards the end of the civil wars (prompted by Parliament's failure to pay the troops). They showed little sympathy for the Levellers, an egalitarian movement which had contributed greatly to Parliament's cause but sought representation for ordinary citizens. The Leveller point of view had been strongly represented in the Putney Debates, held between the various factions of the Army in 1647, just prior to the King's temporary escape from army custody. Cromwell and the Grandees were not prepared to permit such a radical democracy and used the debates to play for time while the future of the King was being determined. Catholics were persecuted zealously under Cromwell. Although he personally was in favour of religious toleration ‚Äì \\"liberty for tender consciences\\" ‚Äì not all his compatriots agreed. The war led to much death and chaos in Ireland where Irish Catholics and Protestants who fought for the Royalists were persecuted. There was a ban on many forms of entertainment, as public meetings could be used as a cover for conspirators; horse racing was banned, the maypoles were famously cut down, the theatres were closed, and Christmas celebrations were outlawed for being too ceremonial, Catholic, and \\"popish\\". Much of Cromwell's power was due to the Rump Parliament, a Parliament purged of opposition to grandees in the New Model Army. Whereas Charles I had been in part restrained by a Parliament that would not always do as he wished (the cause of the Civil War), Cromwell was able to wield much more power as only loyalists were allowed to become MPs, turning the chamber into a rubber-stamping organisation. This was ironic given his complaints about Charles I acting without heeding the \\"wishes\\" of the people. But even so he found it almost impossible to get his Parliaments to follow all his wishes. His executive decisions were often thwarted ‚Äì most famously in the ending of the rule of the regional major generals appointed by himself. In 1657 Cromwell was offered the crown by Parliament, presenting him with a dilemma since he had played a great role in abolishing the monarchy. After two months of deliberation, he rejected the offer. Instead, he was ceremonially re-installed as \\"Lord Protector of England, Scotland and Ireland\\" (Wales was a part of England), with greater powers than he had previously held. It is often suggested that offering Cromwell the Crown was an effort to curb his power: as a King he would be obliged to honour agreements such as Magna Carta, but under the arrangement he had designed he had no such restraints. This allowed him to preserve and enhance his power and the army's while decreasing Parliament's control over him, probably to enable him to maintain a well-funded army which Parliament could not be depended upon to provide. The office of Lord Protector was not formally hereditary, although Cromwell was able to nominate his own successor in his son, Richard. =Restoration of the monarchy= Although England, Scotland and Ireland became constitutional monarchies, after the reigns of Charles II and his brother James II and VII, and with the ascension of William III and Mary II to the English, Irish and Scottish thrones as a result of the Glorious Revolution of 1688, there have been movements throughout the last few centuries whose aims were to remove the monarchy and establish a republican system. A notable period was the time in the late 18th century and early 19th century when many Radicals such as the minister Joseph Fawcett were openly republican.White, Daniel E. (2006). Early Romanticism and religious dissent. Cambridge University Press, p. 93 = American and French Revolutions = Thomas Paine (1737‚Äì1809): \\"One of the strongest natural proofs of the folly of hereditary right in kings is that nature disproves it, otherwise she would not so frequently turn it into ridicule, by giving mankind an ass for a lion.\\" The American Revolution had a great impact on political thought in the British Isles. According to Christopher Hitchens, the British‚ÄìAmerican author, philosopher, politician and activist, Thomas Paine was the \\"moral author of the American Revolution\\", who posited in the soon widely read pamphlet Common Sense (January 1776) that the conflict of the Thirteen Colonies with the Hanoverian monarchy in London was best resolved by setting up a separate democratic republic. To him, republicanism was more important than independence. However, the circumstances forced the American revolutionaries to give up any hope of reconciliation with Britain, and reforming its 'corrupt' monarchial government, that so often dragged the American colonies in its European wars, from within. He and other British republican writers saw in the Declaration of Independence (4 July 1776) a legitimate struggle against the Crown, that violated people's freedom and rights, and denied them representation in politics. When the French Revolution broke out in 1789, debates started in the British Isles on how to respond. Soon a pro- Revolutionary republican and anti-Revolutionary monarchist camp had established themselves amongst the intelligentsia, who waged a pamphlet war until 1795. Prominent figures of the republican camp were Mary Wollstonecraft, William Godwin and again Thomas Paine., ed. Burke, Paine, Godwin, and the Revolution Controversy (1984), p. 1. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press . Paine would also play an important role inside the Revolution in France as an elected member of the National Convention (1792‚Äì93), where he lobbied for the invasion of Britain to establish a republic after the example of the United States, France and its Sister Republics, but also famously opposed the execution of Louis XVI, which got him arrested. The First French Republic would indeed stage an Expedition to Ireland in December 1796 to help the Society of United Irishmen set up an Irish republic in order to destabilise the United Kingdom, but this ended in a failure. The subsequent Irish Rebellion of 1798 was utterly crushed by the British Army. Napoleon also planned an invasion of Britain since 1798 and more seriously since 1803, but in 1804 he relinquished republicanism by crowning himself Emperor of the French and converting all Sister Republics into client kingdoms of the French Empire, before calling off the invasion of Britain altogether in 1805. = Revolutionary republicanism, 1800‚Äì1848 = British republican flag, originated in 1816, in use until at least 1935. From the start of the French Revolution into the early 19th century, the revolutionary blue-white-red tricolour was used throughout England, Wales and Ireland in defiance of the royal establishment. During the 1816 Spa Fields riots, a green, white and red horizontal flag appeared for the first time, soon followed by a red, white and green horizontal version allegedly in use during the 1817 Pentrich rising and the 1819 Peterloo Massacre. The latter is now associated with Hungary, but then it became known as the British Republican Flag. It may have been inspired by the French revolutionary tricolour, but this is unclear. It was however often accompanied by slogans consisting of three words such as \\"Fraternity ‚Äì Liberty ‚Äì Humanity\\" (a clear reference to Libert√©, √©galit√©, fraternit√©), and adopted by the Chartist movement in the 1830s. Besides these skirmishes in Great Britain itself, separatist republican revolutions against the British monarchy during the Canadian rebellions of 1837‚Äì38 and the Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848 failed. Parliament passed the Treason Felony Act in 1848. This act made advocacy of republicanism punishable by transportation to Australia, which was later amended to life imprisonment. The law is still on the statute books; however in a 2003 case, the Law Lords stated that \\"It is plain as a pike staff to the respondents and everyone else that no one who advocates the peaceful abolition of the monarchy and its replacement by a republican form of government is at any risk of prosecution\\", for the reason that the Human Rights Act 1998 would require the 1848 Act to be interpreted in such a way as to render such conduct non-criminal. = Late 19th century = During the later years of Queen Victoria's reign, there was considerable criticism of her decision to withdraw from public life following the death of her husband, Prince Albert. This resulted in a \\"significant incarnation\\" of republicanism.Andrzej Olechnowicz, The Monarchy and the British Nation, 1780 to the Present. Cambridge University Press, 2007. , (p. 190). During the 1870s, calls for Britain to become a republic on the American or French model were made by the politicians Charles DilkeThomas M. Costa, \\"Dilke, Charles Wentworth\\" in Historical Dictionary of the British Empire edited by James S. Olson and Robert Shadle. Greenwood Press, 1996 and Charles Bradlaugh, as well as journalist George W. M. Reynolds. This republican presence continued in debates and the Labour press, especially in the event of royal weddings, jubilees and births, until well into the Interwar Period. Some members of the Labour Party, such as Keir Hardie (1856‚Äì1915), also held republican views.Reid, Fred. (1978) Keir Hardie: the making of a socialist. Croom Helm, p. 96. . = 20th-century republicanism = In 1923, at the Labour Party's annual conference, two motions were proposed, supported by Ernest Thurtle and Emrys Hughes. The first was \\"that the Royal Family is no longer a necessary party of the British constitution\\", and the second was \\"that the hereditary principle in the British Constitution be abolished\\".Kingsley Martin, The Crown and the Establishment. London, Hutchinson. 1962 (pp. 53‚Äì54) George Lansbury responded that, although he too was a republican, he regarded the issue of the monarchy as a \\"distraction\\" from more important issues. Lansbury added that he believed the \\"social revolution\\" would eventually remove the monarchy peacefully in the future. Both of the motions were overwhelmingly defeated.Martin Pugh, Speak for Britain!: A New History of the Labour Party. London : Vintage, 2011. (p. 170).Jeremy Paxman, On Royalty : A Very Polite Inquiry Into Some Strangely Related Families (pp. 206‚Äì07) Following this event, most of the Labour Party moved away from advocating republican views. In 1936, following the abdication of Edward VIII, MP James Maxton proposed a \\"republican amendment\\" to the Abdication Bill, which would have established a Republic in Britain. Maxton argued that while the monarchy had benefited Britain in the past, it had now \\"outlived its usefulness\\". Five MPs voted to support the bill, including Alfred Salter. However the bill was defeated by 403 votes.Denis Judd, George VI. London, IB Tauris, 2012. (p. 157).Fenner Brockway, Bermondsey Story: the Life of Alfred Salter. London, Allen and Unwin, 1949 (p. 201). Tony Benn in 2007. In 1991, Labour MP Tony Benn introduced the Commonwealth of Britain Bill, which called for the transformation of the United Kingdom into a \\"democratic, federal and secular Commonwealth of Britain\\", with an elected President. The monarchy would be abolished and replaced by a republic with a written constitution. It was read in Parliament a number of times until his retirement at the 2001 election, but never achieved a second reading. Benn presented an account of his proposal in Common Sense: A New Constitution for Britain. In January 1997, ITV broadcast a live television debate Monarchy: The Nation Decides, in which 2.5 million viewers voted on the question \\"Do you want a monarch?\\" by telephone. Speaking for the republican view were Professor Stephen Haseler, (chairman of Republic), agony aunt Claire Rayner, Paul Flynn, Labour MP for Newport West and Andrew Neil, then the former editor of The Sunday Times. Those in favour of the monarchy included author Frederick Forsyth, Bernie Grant, Labour MP for Tottenham, and Jeffrey Archer, former deputy chairman of the Conservative Party. Conservative MP Steven Norris was scheduled to appear in a discussion towards the end of the programme, but officials from Carlton Television said he had left without explanation. The debate was conducted in front of an audience of 3,000 at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham, with the telephone poll result being that 66% of voters wanted a monarch, and 34% did not. = 21st-century republicanism = MORI polls in the opening years of the 21st century showed support for retaining the monarchy stable at around 70% of people, but in 2005, at the time of the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles, support for the monarchy dipped, with one poll showing that 65% of people would support keeping the monarchy if there were a referendum on the issue, with 22% saying they favoured a republic. In 2009 an ICM poll, commissioned by the BBC, found that 76% of those asked wanted the monarchy to continue after the Queen, against 18% of people who said they would favour Britain becoming a republic and 6% who said they did not know. In February 2011, a YouGov poll put support for ending the monarchy after the Queen's death at 13%, if Prince Charles becomes King. However, an ICM poll shortly before the royal wedding suggested that 26% thought Britain would be better off without the monarchy, with only 37% \\"genuinely interested and excited\\" by the wedding. In April 2011, in the lead up to the Royal Wedding, an Ipsos MORI poll of 1,000 British adults found that 75% of the public would like Britain to remain a monarchy, with 18% in favour of Britain becoming a republic. In May 2012, in the lead up to the Queen's Diamond Jubilee, an Ipsos MORI poll of 1,006 British adults found that 80% were in favour of the monarchy, with 13% in favour of the United Kingdom becoming a republic. This was thought to be a record high figure in recent years in favour of the monarchy. The main organisation campaigning for a republic in the United Kingdom is the campaign group Republic. Formed in 1983, Republic is frequently cited by much of the UK media on issues involving the royal family.Holly Wallis, Diamond Jubilee v Republican Britain, BBC News, 27 May 2012. Retrieved 13 May 2013BBC News, Prince Charles hits out at climate change sceptics, 9 May 2013. Retrieved 13 May 2013 In September 2015, Jeremy Corbyn, a Labour MP with republican views, won his party's leadership election and became both Leader of the Opposition and Leader of the Labour Party. In 1991, Corbyn had seconded the Commonwealth of Britain Bill. However, Corbyn stated during his 2015 campaign for the leadership that republicanism was \\"not a battle that I am fighting\\". At the swearing of oaths in the Commons following the 2017 general election, Republic reported that several MPs had prefixed their oath/affirmation of allegiance with broadly republican sentiments.  Supporters  A number of prominent individuals in the United Kingdom advocate republicanism. =Political parties= , none of the three major British political parties ‚Äì the Labour Party, the Conservative Party and the SNP ‚Äì have an official policy of republicanism. However, there are a number of individual politicians who favour abolition of the monarchy (see above). Tony Benn of the Labour Party introduced a Commonwealth of Britain Bill in Parliament in 1991. Jeremy Corbyn, leader of the Labour Party from 2015 to 2020, is a republican, but had stated that he would not seek to abolish the monarchy whilst he remained leader. The Green Party of England and Wales, with one MP in Parliament since 2010, has an official policy of republicanism.Could we have the first republican party MPs after this election? ‚Äì Republic. Published 16 April 2010. Retrieved 17 August 2012. The Irish republican party Sinn F√©in has seven MPs, but they only participate in local and devolved government, and do not take their UK parliamentary seats. The Scottish Green Party, with six MSPs in the 2016‚Äì2021 Scottish Parliament, supports having an elected Head of State in an independent Scotland. =Lobby groups= The largest lobby group in favour of republicanism in the United Kingdom is the Republic campaign group, founded in 1983. The group has benefited from occasional negative publicity about the Royal Family, and Republic reported a large rise in membership following the wedding of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles. Republic has lobbied on changes to the parliamentary oath of allegiance, royal finances and changes to the Freedom of Information Act relating to the monarchy, none of which have produced any change. However, Republic has been invited to Parliament to talk as witnesses on certain issues related to the monarchy such as conduct of the honours system in the United Kingdom. In 2009 Republic made news by reporting Prince Charles's architecture charity to the Charity Commission, claiming that the Prince was effectively using the organisation as a private lobbying firm (the Commission declined to take the matter further). Republic has previously broken stories about royals using the Freedom of Information Act. The organisation is regularly called up to comment and provide quotes for the press, national and local radio and national TV programmes, with much criticism as to the portrayal of the monarchy by the BBC which has been accused of celebrating the monarchy rather than keeping its politically neutral stance on issues related to it. Labour for a Republic is the Labour Party's campaign for an elected head of state, and acts as a pressure group made up of members and supporters of the party. It advocates abolition of the monarchy in favour of a democratic republic. =Media= The Guardian, Observer and Independent newspapers have all advocated the abolition of the monarchy. In the wake of the 2009 MPs' expenses scandal, a poll of readers of the Guardian and Observer newspapers placed support for abolition of the monarchy at 54%, although only 3% saw it as a top priority. Arguments in favour of a republic =The benefits of a republic= Republicans suggest that republicanism is a constitutional step which answers a number of key issues. The advocacy group Republic argues: Republicans also want to see a constitution that they claim will inspire aspiration (by allowing anyone to become head of state) and political responsibility (by introducing popular sovereignty, the notion that the people are \\"in charge\\"). They also claim that they want what is \\"best for Britain\\", which includes the best democracy. =Arguments against monarchy= Republicans assert that hereditary monarchy is unfair and elitist. They claim that in a modern and democratic society no one should be expected to defer to another simply because of their birth. Such a system, they assert, does not make for a society which is at ease with itself, and it encourages attitudes which are more suited to a bygone age of imperialism than to a \\"modern nation\\". Some claim that maintaining a privileged royal family diminishes a society and encourages a feeling of dependency in many people who should instead have confidence in themselves and their fellow citizens. Further, republicans argue that \\"the people\\", not the members of one family, should be sovereign. ;Monarchy contradicts democracy :;Monarchy denies the people a basic right: Republicans believe that it should be a fundamental right of the people of any nation to elect their head of state and for every citizen to be eligible to hold that office. It is argued such a head of state is more accountable to the people, and that such accountability to the people creates a better nation.Hames, Tim; Leonard, Mark (1998). Modernising the monarchy. Demos. p. 22. . :;Monarchy devalues a parliamentary system: Monarchical prerogative powers can be used to circumvent normal democratic process with no accountability, and such processes are more desirable than not for any given nation-state. ;A monarchy demands deference :It is argued by republicans that the way citizens are expected to address members, however junior, of the royal family is part of an attempt to keep subjects \\"in their place\\".Bertram, Christopher (2004). Routledge philosophy guidebook to Rousseau and The social contract. Routledge. p. 160. ;It is the enemy of merit and aspiration :The order of succession in a monarchy specifies a person who will become head of state, regardless of qualifications. The highest titular office in the land is not open to \\"free and fair competition\\". Although monarchists argue that the position of Prime Minister, the title with real power, is something anyone can aspire to become, the executive and symbolically powerful position of Head of State is not. ;Monarchy imposes a state religion :Republicans argue that a monarch who is the head of an established church in an increasingly secular and multicultural society reinforces the notion of hereditary privilege based on the divine right of kings. On the royal coat of arms is the motto in (God and my right). The established church in England is the Church of England which has the King or Queen of the United Kingdom as its head. The church is tax exempt and provides the House of Lords in Parliament with 26 unelected bishops as its representatives. ;It devalues intellect and achievement :Republicans argue that members of the royal family bolster their position with unearned symbols of achievement. Examples in the UK include the Queen's many honorary military titles of colonel-in-chief, regardless of her military experience. There is debate over the roles which the members of the monarchy have played in the military; many doubt that members of the Royal Family have served on the front line on the same basis as other members of the Armed Forces. Examples here include Prince Andrew, whose presence during the Falklands War was later criticised by the commander of the British Naval Force who stated that \\"special measures\\" had to be taken to ensure that the prince did not lose his life, and Prince Harry, who was moved to a safe room and placed under guard during an attack on the Camp Bastion base in Afghanistan. It is seen to some as more of a PR exercise than military service. Members of the royal family are fast-tracked to higher ranks in the army. ;It harms the monarchs themselves :Republicans argue that a hereditary system condemns each heir to the throne to an abnormal childhood. This was historically the reason why the anarchist William Godwin opposed the monarchy. Johann Hari has written a book God Save the Queen? in which he argues that every member of the royal family has suffered psychologically from the system of monarchy. ;Monarchs are not impartial, and lack accountability :Republicans argue that monarchs are not impartial but harbour their own opinions, motives, and wish to protect their interests. Republicans claim that monarchs are not accountable. As an example, republicans argue that Prince Charles has spoken and acted in ways that have widely been interpreted as taking a political stance, citing his refusal to attend, in protest of China's dealings with Tibet, a state dinner hosted by the Queen for the Chinese head of state; his strong stance on GM food; and the contents of the black spider memos, which were released following freedom of information litigation, regarding how people achieve their positions.Palace defends prince's letters. BBC News. 25 September 2002.Assinder, Nick; BBC News: Royals dragged into Haider row. BBC News. 9 February 2000. Republicans see a lack of important democratic accountability and transparency for such institutions. ;The monarchy is expensive :Republicans argue that it costs a lot to have a monarchy. Republicans claim that the total costs to taxpayers including hidden elements (e.g., the Royal Protection security bill and lost rental income from palaces and state-owned land) of the monarchy are ¬£334 million per annum. The Daily Telegraph claims the monarchy costs each adult in Britain around 62p a year. However, this figure does not take into account royal security, nor the money paid by regional councils to fund the costs of visits by members of the Royal Family, and assumes the \\"official\\" figure of ¬£34m per annum to be divided between every man, woman and child in the land. Republic also argues that the Royal finances, which are exempt from the Freedom of Information Act, are shrouded in secrecy and should be subject to greater scrutiny. Although monarchists argue that this does not take into account the \\"hereditary revenues\\" which generated ¬£190.8 million for the treasury in 2007‚Äì2008, republicans assert that the Crown Estate, from which these revenues are derived, is national and State property, and that the monarch cannot surrender what they have never owned. The monarchy is estimated to cost British taxpayers ¬£202.4m, when costs such as security are included, making it the most expensive monarchy in Europe and 112 times more expensive than the presidency of the Republic of Ireland. The argument that tourism benefits from the continued existence of the British monarchy is refuted by Republic, who suggest that the reverse may actually be true ‚Äì if the palaces were open throughout the year, tourists would be better able to visit them (as has happened with the Tower of London). ;The monarchy makes the UK appear \\"backward\\" :Republicans argue that the monarchy is to be considered embarrassing: as a concept it is archaic, too reminiscent of medieval feudalism, and while the UK has a hereditary head of state it cannot claim to be a modern nation. Arguments in favour of constitutional monarchy =Monarchy can be complementary to rather than a replacement for democracy= Some argue that the current system is still democratic as the Government and MPs of Parliament are elected by universal suffrage and as the Crown acts only on the advice of the Parliament, the people still hold power. Monarchy only refers to how the head of state is chosen and not how the Government is chosen. It is only undemocratic if the monarchy holds meaningful power, which it currently does not as government rests with Parliament. However, it was revealed in October 2011 that both the Queen and Prince Charles do have the power to veto government legislation which affects their private interests. The Queen attended a cabinet meeting on 18 December 2012 ‚Äì the first Monarch to have done so since George III in 1781. =Provides a safeguard against government instability= Some argue that the Monarch's constitutional position (with the little-used power to dissolve or refuse a government) could safeguard against Britain ever becoming a dictatorship; however, Republic has denied claims that the monarchy has this sort of power. Examples of this argument being used often include the 1981 April Fool's Day Coup in Thailand and the El Tejerazo coup in Spain when King Bhumibol and King Juan Carlos I respectively stepped in to restore democracy in their countries, or when King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy dismissed and ordered the arrest of Benito Mussolini. =Safeguards the constitutional rights of the individual= The British constitutional system sets limits on Parliament and separates the executive from direct control over the police and courts. Constitutionalists argue that this is because contracts with the monarch such as the Magna Carta, the Declaration of Rights, the Act of Settlement and the Acts of Union place obligations on the state and confirm its citizens as sovereign beings. These obligations are re-affirmed at every monarch's coronation. These obligations, whilst at the same time placing limits on the power of the judiciary and the police, also confirm those rights which are intrinsically part of British and especially English culture.House of Commons Library 6 July 2011 Examples are Common Law, the particular status of ancient practices, jury trials, legal precedent, protection against non-judicial seizure and the right to protest. =Provides a focal point for unity and tradition= Monarchists argue that a constitutional monarch with limited powers and non-partisan nature can provide a focus for national unity, national awards and honours, national institutions, and allegiance, as opposed to a president affiliated to a political party.Bogdanor, V. (1997). The Monarchy and the Constitution. ch11 =If there were a republic, the costs may remain the same= Some argue that if there were a republic, the costs incurred in regards to the duties of the head of state would remain more or less the same. This includes the upkeep and conservation of the royal palaces and buildings which would still have to be paid for as they belong to the nation as a whole rather than the monarch personally. On top of that, the head of state would require a salary and security, state visits, banquets and ceremonial duties would still go ahead. In 2009, the monarchy claimed to be costing each person an estimated 69 pence a year (not including \\"a hefty security bill\\").The Press Secretary to the Queen, The British Monarchy website 6 July 2011 However, the figure of 69p per person has been criticised for having been calculated by dividing the overall figure by approximately 60 million people, rather than by the number of British taxpayers. =A British Republic has already been tested and failed= Even though no modern republicans advocate a republic modelled on Cromwell's Protectorate, someDavid Plant, The Rump Parliament, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website http://www.british-civil- wars.co.uk/glossary/rump-parliament.htm 6 July 2011 point out that a Republican government under the Commonwealth of England and then the Commonwealth of England, Scotland, and Ireland has already been tried when Oliver Cromwell installed it on 30 January 1649. Yet by February 1657 some peopleA group of MPs headed by Lord Broghill, David Plant, Biography of Oliver Cromwell, British Civil Wars and Commonwealth website http://www.british- civil-wars.co.uk/biog/oliver-cromwell.htm 6 July 2011 argued that Cromwell should assume the crown as it would stabilise the constitution, limit his powers and restore precedent. Cromwell declined. Within three years of his death the Republic had lost support and the monarchy was restored. Later, during The Glorious Revolution of 1688 caused partially by disillusionment with the absolutist rule of the Scottish James II and VII, Parliament and others, such as John LockeThe philosopher John Locke, 'John Locke Natural Rights to Life, Liberty, and Property', Jim Powell, senior fellow, Cato Institute, 6 July 2011 argued that James had broken \\"the original contract\\" with the state. Far from pressing for a republic, which had been experienced within living memory, they instead argued that the best form of government was a constitutional monarchy with explicitly circumscribed powers. (This overlooks a few factors, however ‚Äì Cromwell's republic was based on the ideals of puritanism and land-based privilege, whilst modern republican advocates have strong links to secularism and expansion of democracy. Cromwell was also not a republican in the strict sense, and opposed groups that were, such as the Levellers).

Like most Old English poetry, it is written in alliterative verse. Rood is from the Old English word r≈çd 'pole', or more specifically 'crucifix'. Preserved in the 10th-century Vercelli Book, the poem may be as old as the 8th-century Ruthwell Cross, and is considered as one of the oldest work of Old English literature. Synopsis The poem is set up with the narrator having a dream. In this dream or vision he is speaking to the Cross on which Jesus was crucified. The poem itself is divided up into three separate sections: the first part (ll. 1‚Äì27), the second part (ll. 28‚Äì121) and the third part (ll. 122‚Äì156).Acevedo Butcher, Carmen, The Dream of the Rood and Its Unique, Penitential Language . Rome (GA), 2003. p. 2 In section one, the narrator has a vision of the Cross. Initially when the dreamer sees the Cross, he notes how it is covered with gems. He is aware of how wretched he is compared to how glorious the tree is. However, he comes to see that amidst the beautiful stones it is stained with blood.Bradley, S.A.J. Anglo-Saxon Poetry. Ed. S.A.J. Bradley. London, Everyman, 1982, p. 160 In section two, the Cross shares its account of Jesus' death. The Crucifixion story is told from the perspective of the Cross. It begins with the enemy coming to cut the tree down and carrying it away. The tree learns that it is not to be the bearer of a criminal, but instead Christ crucified. The Lord and the Cross become one, and they stand together as victors, refusing to fall, taking on insurmountable pain for the sake of mankind. It is not just Christ, but the Cross as well that is pierced with nails. Adelhied L. J. Thieme remarks, \\"The cross itself is portrayed as his lord's retainer whose most outstanding characteristic is that of unwavering loyalty\\". The Rood and Christ are one in the portrayal of the Passion‚Äîthey are both pierced with nails, mocked and tortured. Then, just as with Christ, the Cross is resurrected, and adorned with gold and silver. It is honoured above all trees just as Jesus is honoured above all men. The Cross then charges the visionary to share all that he has seen with others. In section three, the author gives his reflections about this vision. The vision ends, and the man is left with his thoughts. He gives praise to God for what he has seen and is filled with hope for eternal life and his desire to once again be near the glorious Cross.Lapidge, Michael. The Blackwell Encyclopedia of Anglo-Saxon England. England, 1991. Structure There are various, alternative readings of the structure of the poem, given the many components of the poem and the lack of clear divisions. Scholars like Faith H. Patten divide the poem into three parts, based on who is speaking: Introductory Section (lines 1‚Äì26), Speech of the Cross (lines 28‚Äì121), and Closing Section (lines 122‚Äì156). Though the most obvious way to divide the poem, this does not take into account thematic unity or differences in tone. Constance B. Hieatt distinguishes between portions of the Cross's speech based on speaker, subject, and verbal parallels, resulting in: Prologue (lines 1‚Äì27), Vision I (lines 28‚Äì77): history of the Rood, Vision II (lines 78‚Äì94): explanation of the Rood's glory, Vision III (lines 95‚Äì121): the Rood's message to mankind, and Epilogue (lines 122‚Äì156). M. I. Del Mastro suggests the image of concentric circles, similar to a chiasmus, repetitive and reflective of the increased importance in the center: the narrator-dreamer's circle (lines 1‚Äì27), the rood's circle (lines 28‚Äì38), Christ's circle (lines 39-73a), the rood's circle (lines 73b-121), and the narrator-dreamer's circle (lines 122‚Äì156).  Manuscript  The Dream of the Rood survives in the Vercelli Book, so called because the manuscript is now in the Italian city of Vercelli. The Vercelli Book, which can be dated to the 10th century, includes twenty-three homilies interspersed with six religious poems: The Dream of the Rood, Andreas, The Fates of the Apostles, Soul and Body, Elene and a poetic, homiletic fragment. Sources and analogues The Ruthwell Cross A part of The Dream of the Rood can be found on the eighth-century Ruthwell Cross, which is an , free-standing Anglo-Saxon cross that was perhaps intended as a 'conversion tool'. At each side of the vine-tracery are carved runes. There is an excerpt on the cross that was written in runes along with scenes from the Gospels, lives of saints, images of Jesus healing the blind, the Annunciation, and the story of Egypt, as well as Latin antiphons and decorative scroll-work. Although it was torn down after the Scottish Reformation, it was possible to mostly reconstruct it in the 19th century.O Carragain, Eamonn. Ritual and the Rood: Liturgical Images and the Poems of The Dream of the Rood Tradition. London, University of Toronto Press, 2005, p. 7, 228 Recent scholarly thinking about the cross tends to see the runes as a later addition to an existing monument with images. A similar representation of the Cross is also present in Riddle 9 by the eighth-century Anglo-Saxon writer Tatwine. Tatwine's riddle reads:Tatwine, ‚ÄòLatin Riddle 9 (early 8th century)‚Äô, in Sources and Analogues of Old English Poetry, ed. and trans. by D. G. Calder and M. J. B. Allen (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1976), pp. 53-58. > Now I appear iridescent; my form is shining now. Once, because of the law, I > was a spectral terror to all slaves; but now the whole earth joyfully > worships and adorns me. Whoever enjoys my fruit will immediately be well, > for I was given the power to bring health to the unhealthy. Thus a wise man > chooses to keep me on his forehead. Possible authorship The author of The Dream of the Rood is unknown. Moreover, it is possible that the poem as it stands is the work of multiple authors. The approximate eighth-century date of the Ruthwell Cross indicates the earliest likely date and Northern circulation of some version of The Dream of the Rood. Nineteenth-century scholars tried to attribute the poem to the few named Old English poets. Daniel H. Haigh argued that the inscription of the Ruthwell Cross must be fragments of a lost poem by C√¶dmon, portrayed in Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English People as the first Christian English poet, stating \\"On this monument, erected about A.D. 665, we have fragments of a religious poem of very high character, and that there was but one man living in England at that time worthy to be named as a religious poet, and that was Caedmon\\".Cook, Albert S., ed. The Dream of the Rood: An Old English Poem Attributed to Cynewulf. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1905. 27 Sep 2007, p. 6 Likewise, George Stephens contended that the language and structure of The Dream of the Rood indicated a seventh-century date. Supposing that the only Christian poet before Bede was C√¶dmon, Stephens argued that C√¶dmon must have composed The Dream of the Rood. Furthermore, he claimed that the Ruthwell Cross includes a runic inscription that can be interpreted as saying \\"Caedmon made me\\".Cook, Albert S., ed. The Dream of the Rood: An Old English Poem Attributed to Cynewulf. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1905. 27 Sep 2007, p. 7 These ideas are no longer accepted by scholars. Likewise, some scholars have tried to attribute The Dream of the Rood to Cynewulf, a named Old English poet who lived around the ninth century.Krstovic, Jelena. ed. \\"The Dream of the Rood: Introduction.\\" Classical and Medieval Literature Criticism. Vol 14. Gale Group, Inc., 1995. enotes.com. 2006. 27 September 2007 Two of Cynewulf's signed poems are found in the Vercelli Book, the manuscript that contains The Dream of the Rood, among them Elene, which is about Saint Helena's supposed discovery of the cross on which Jesus was crucified.Drabble, Margaret. ed. \\"The Vercelli Book: Introduction.\\" The Oxford Companion to English Literature. Ed. 5th Edition. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1985. 27 Sep 2007, p. 2 Thus Franz Dietrich argued that the similarities between Cynewulf's Elene and The Dream of the Rood reveal that the two must have been authored by the same individual.Dietrich made four main arguments: one, the theme of both poems is the cross, and more importantly, in both poems, the cross suffers with Christ; two, in \\"Elene\\" Cynewulf seems to make clear references to the same cross in Dream of the Rood; three, in \\"Elene\\" and his other poems Cynewulf usually speaks of himself, which makes it quite possible that the dreamer in Dream of the Rood is none other than Cynewulf himself; and finally four, \\"In both poems the author represents himself as old, having lost joys or friends and as ready to depart. Cook, Albert S., ed. The Dream of the Rood: An Old English Poem Attributed to Cynewulf. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1905. 27 Sep 2007, p. 12-13 Again, however, this attribution is not widely accepted. In a series of papers, Leonard Neidorf has adduced metrical, lexical, and syntactical evidence in support of a theory of composite authorship for The Dream of the Rood. He maintains that the poem contains contributions from at least two different poets, who had distinct compositional styles.https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/anglo-saxon- england/article/composite-authorship-of-the-dream-of-the- rood/263B18A108EC62A2516BCF0E135C32D2https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0895769X.2020.1782723https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0013838X.2020.1820711https://academic.oup.com/nq/advance- article-abstract/doi/10.1093/notesj/gjaa071/5896060?redirectedFrom=fulltext Paganism and Christianity Like many poems of the Anglo-Saxon period, The Dream of the Rood exhibits many Christian and pre-Christian images, but in the end is a Christian piece.Mitchell, Bruce. A Guide to Old English. Sixth Edition. Massachusetts. Blackwell Publishers, 2001, p. 256 Examining the poem as a pre-Christian (or pagan) piece is difficult, as the scribes who wrote it down were Christian monks who lived in a time when Christianity was firmly established (at least among the aristocracy) in Anglo-Saxon England.Mitchell, Bruce. A Guide to Old English. Sixth Edition. Massachusetts. Blackwell Publishers, 2001, p. 139-140 Anglo-Saxon influence can be identified by the use of a complex, echoing structure, allusions, repetition, verbal parallels, the ambiguity and wordplay of the Riddles, and the language of heroic poetry and elegy. Some scholars have argued that there is a prevalence of pagan elements within the poem, claiming that the idea of a talking tree is animistic. The belief in the spiritual nature of natural objects, it has been argued, recognises the tree as an object of worship. In Heathen Gods in Old English Literature, Richard North stresses the importance of the sacrifice of the tree in accordance with pagan virtues. He states that \\"the image of Christ's death was constructed in this poem with reference to an Anglian ideology on the world tree\\".North, Richard. Heathen Gods in Old English Literature. Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 273 North suggests that the author of The Dream of the Rood \\"uses the language of this myth of Ingui in order to present the Passion to his newly Christianized countrymen as a story from their native tradition\\". Furthermore, the tree's triumph over death is celebrated by adorning the cross with gold and jewels. Work of the period is notable for its synthetic employment of 'Pagan' and 'Christian' imagery as can be seen on the Franks Casket or the Kirkby Stephen cross shaft which appears to conflate the image of Christ crucified with that of Woden/Odin bound upon the Tree of Life.Anglo-saxon Art, Leslie Webster, British Museum Press, 2012 Others have read the poem's blend of Christian themes with the heroic conventions as an Anglo-Saxon embrace and re-imagining, rather than conquest, of Christianity. The poem may also be viewed as both Christian and pre- Christian. Bruce Mitchell notes that The Dream of the Rood is \\"the central literary document for understanding [the] resolution of competing cultures which was the presiding concern of the Christian Anglo-Saxons\\". Within the single culture of the Anglo-Saxons is the conflicting Germanic heroic tradition and the Christian doctrine of forgiveness and self-sacrifice, the influences of which are readily seen in the poetry of the period. Thus, for instance, in The Dream of the Rood, Christ is presented as a \\"heroic warrior, eagerly leaping on the Cross to do battle with death; the Cross is a loyal retainer who is painfully and paradoxically forced to participate in his Lord's execution\\".Black, Joseph ed., Supplement to Broadview Anthology of British Literature. Broadview Press, 2007, p. 23 Christ can also be seen as \\"an Anglo-Saxon warrior lord, who is served by his thanes, especially on the cross and who rewards them at the feast of glory in Heaven\\".Dockray-Miller, Mary. \\"The Feminized Cross of 'The Dream of the Rood.'\\" Philogical Quarterly, Vol 76. 1997, p. 2. Thus, the crucifixion of Christ is a victory, because Christ could have fought His enemies, but chose to die. John Canuteson believes that the poem \\"show[s] Christ's willingness, indeed His eagerness, to embrace His fate, [and] it also reveals the physical details of what happens to a man, rather than a god, on the Cross\\".Canuteson, John. \\"The Crucifixion and Second Coming of Christ.\\" Modern Philology, Vol. 66, No. 4, May 1969, p. 296 This image of Christ as a 'heroic lord' or a 'heroic warrior' is seen frequently in Anglo-Saxon (and Germanic) literature and follows in line with the theme of understanding Christianity through pre-Christian Germanic tradition. In this way, \\"the poem resolves not only the pagan-Christian tensions within Anglo-Saxon culture but also current doctrinal discussions concerning the nature of Christ, who was both God and man, both human and divine\\".Mitchell, Bruce. A Guide to Old English. Sixth Edition. Massachusetts. Blackwell Publishers, 2001, p. 257 Other interpretations J.A. Burrow notes an interesting paradox within the poem in how the Cross is set up to be the way to Salvation: the Cross states that it cannot fall and it must stay strong to fulfill the will of God. However, to fulfill this grace of God, the Cross has to be a critical component in Jesus' death.Burrow, J.A. \\"An Approach to The Dream of the Rood.\\" Neophilologus. 43(1959), p. 125. This puts a whole new light on the actions of Jesus during the Crucifixion. Neither Jesus nor the Cross is given the role of the helpless victim in the poem, but instead both stand firm. The Cross says, Jesus is depicted as the strong conqueror and is made to appear a \\"heroic German lord, one who dies to save his troops\\".Treharne, Elaine. \\"The Dream of the Rood.\\" Old and Middle English c.890-c.1400: An Anthology. Malden, MA, Blackwell, 2004, p. 108 Instead of accepting crucifixion, he 'embraces' the Cross and takes on all the sins of mankind. Rebecca Hinton identifies the resemblance of the poem to early medieval Irish sacramental Penance, with the parallels between the concept of sin, the object of confession, and the role of the confessor. She traces the establishment of the practice of Penance in England from Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury from 668 to 690, deriving from the Irish confession philosophy. Within the poem, Hinton reads the dream as a confession of sorts, ending with the narrator invigorated, his \\"spirit longing to start.\\" Faith Patten identified 'sexual imagery' in the poem between the Cross and the Christ figure, noting in particular lines 39‚Äì42, when Christ embraces the Cross after having 'unclothed himself' and leapt onto it. This interpretation was expanded upon by John Canuteson, who argued that this embrace is a 'logical extension of the implications of the marriage of Christ and the Church', and that it becomes 'a kind of marriage consummation' in the poem. Mary Dockray-Miller further argued that this sexual imagery functions to 'feminize' the Cross in order for it to mirror the heightened masculinity of the warrior Christ in the poem.

Located at 525 South Winchester Blvd. in San Jose, the Queen Anne Style Victorian mansion is renowned for its size, its architectural curiosities, and its lack of any master building plan. It is a designated California historical landmark and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. It is privately owned and serves as a tourist attraction. Since its construction in 1886, the property and mansion were claimed by many to be haunted by the ghosts of those killed with Winchester rifles. Under Winchester's day-to-day guidance, its \\"from-the-ground-up\\" construction proceeded around the clock, by some accounts, without interruption, until her death on September 5, 1922, at which time work immediately ceased. Sarah Winchester's biographer, however, says that Winchester \\"routinely dismissed workers for months at a time 'to take such rest as I might'\\" and notes that \\"this flies in the face of claims by today's Mystery House proprietors that work at the ranch was ceaseless for thirty- eight years.\\"  History  Windows inside the house With hundreds of workers living there, all 13 bathrooms had to be functional, but were later disconnected. In Sarah Winchester's later years, one had a window for a nurse to check on her. After her husband's death from tuberculosis in 1881, Sarah Winchester inherited more than US$20.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ). She also received nearly fifty percent ownership of the Winchester Repeating Arms Company, giving her an income of roughly $1,000 per day, equivalent to $ a day in . These inheritances gave her a tremendous amount of wealth which she used to fund the ongoing construction. After her infant daughter died of an illness known as marasmus, a children's disease in which the body wastes away, and her husband died of pulmonary tuberculosis, a Boston medium told her (while supposedly channeling her late husband) that she should leave her home in New Haven and travel West, where she must continuously build a home for herself and the spirits of people who had fallen victim to Winchester rifles. Winchester left New Haven and headed for California. Although it is possible she was simply seeking a change of location and a hobby during her lengthy depression, other sources say that Winchester came to believe her family and fortune were haunted by ghosts and that only by moving West and continuously building them a house could she appease these spirits. In 1884, she purchased an unfinished farmhouse in the Santa Clara Valley and began building her mansion. Carpenters were hired and worked on the house day and night until it became a seven-story mansion. She did not use an architect and added on to the building in a haphazard fashion, so the home contains numerous oddities such as doors and stairs that go nowhere, windows overlooking other rooms and stairs with odd-sized risers. Many accounts attribute these oddities to her belief in ghosts.Most Haunted Environmental psychologists have theorized that the odd layout itself contributes to the feeling of the house being haunted today. Before the 1906 earthquake, the house had been seven stories high and carpenters may have been brought in initially to repair damages caused by the quake. Today it is only four stories. The house is predominantly made of redwood, as Mrs. Winchester preferred the wood; however, she disliked the look of it. She, therefore, demanded that a faux grain and stain be applied. This is why almost all the wood in the home is covered. Approximately of paint were required to paint the house. The home itself is built using a floating foundation that is believed to have saved it from total collapse in the 1906 earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. This type of construction allows the home to shift freely, as it is not completely attached to its brick base. There are roughly 161 rooms, including 40 bedrooms, 2 ballrooms (one completed and one unfinished) as well as 47 fireplaces, over 10,000 panes of glass, 17 chimneys (with evidence of two others), two basement levels and three elevators. Winchester's property was about at one time, but the estate has since been reduced to ‚Äì the minimum necessary to contain the house and nearby outbuildings. It has gold and silver chandeliers, hand-inlaid parquet floors and trim, and a vast array of colors and materials. Due to Mrs. Winchester's debilitating arthritis, special \\"easy riser\\" stairways were installed as a replacement for her original steep construction. This allowed her to move about her home freely as she was only able to raise each foot a few inches. There was only one working toilet for Winchester; it has been said that \\"all other restrooms were decoys to confuse spirits\\" and that this is also \\"the reason why she slept in a different room each night\\". The home's conveniences were rare at the time of its construction. These included steam and forced-air heating, modern indoor toilets and plumbing, push-button gas lights, and Mrs. Winchester's personal (and only) hot shower from indoor plumbing. There are also three elevators, including an Otis electric and one of which was powered by a rare horizontal hydraulic elevator piston. Most elevator pistons are vertical to save space, but Winchester preferred the improved functionality of the horizontal configuration. The manual and emergency tools for the Otis Automatic Electric elevator. Mrs. Winchester never skimped on the many adornments that she believed contributed to its architectural beauty. Many of the stained glass windows were created by the Pacific American Decorative Company. Some were designed specifically for her, and others by her, including a \\"spider web\\" window that featured her favorite web design and the repetition of the number thirteen, another of her preoccupations. This window was never installed but exists in the so-called \\"$25,000 storage room\\" ‚Äì so named because its contents were originally appraised at a value of $25,000. The value today is inestimable, but $25,000 would be . A second window was designed by Tiffany himself, so that when sunlight strikes the prismatic crystals a rainbow is cast across the room. The window was installed in an interior wall in a room with no light exposure, preventing the effect from being seen.http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WMNPMB_Winchester_Mystery_House_San_Jose_CA/about/ A view of the Winchester Mystery House from a highrise building to the south. When Winchester died, all of her possessions (apart from the house) were bequeathed to her niece and personal secretary. Her niece then took everything she wanted and sold the rest in a private auction. It supposedly took six trucks working eight hours a day for six weeks to remove all of the furniture from the home, an account disputed by Winchester's biographer. Mrs. Winchester made no mention of the mansion in her will, and appraisers considered the house worthless due to damage caused by the earthquake, the unfinished design and the impractical nature of its construction. It was sold at auction to a local investor for over $135,000, and subsequently leased for 10 years to John and Mayme Brown, who eventually purchased the house. In February 1923, five months after Winchester's death, the house was opened to the public, with Mayme Brown serving as the first tour guide. Today the home is owned by Winchester Investments LLC, a privately held company representing the descendants of John and Mayme Brown. The home retains unique touches that reflect Mrs. Winchester's beliefs and her reported preoccupation with warding off malevolent spirits. These spirits are said to have directly inspired her as to the way the house should be built. The number thirteen and spider web motifs, which carried spiritual significance for her, occur throughout the house. Tour guides at the house often make claims of Sarah Winchester having patented various architectural features of the house, but a simple search of the US Patent and Trademark Database produces zero patents assigned to her. In 2016, it was announced that another room with period furniture was built in the courtyard: an attic space that contains a pump organ, Victorian couch, dress form, sewing machine and paintings. This room was made available for viewing by the public and features a shooting range game. In 2017, the Winchester Mystery House debuted their first new daytime tour in 20 years, the \\"Explore More Tour\\".

She began her career as a child actor, and became known for her roles in both independent films and mainstream blockbuster features. Her accolades include two Screen Actors Guild Award nominations, a Golden Globe Award nomination, and a Saturn Award. A native of Sparks, Nevada, Malone spent her early life there and in Las Vegas, while her mother acted in local theater productions. Inspired to become an actress herself, Malone convinced her mother to relocate to Los Angeles. After auditioning for several projects, Malone was cast by Anjelica Huston in her television film Bastard Out of Carolina (1996), for which she earned numerous accolades, including Screen Actors Guild and Independent Spirit Award nominations. She subsequently obtained roles in the major studio productions Contact (1997) and Stepmom (1998), for the former of which she earned a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. Malone appeared in the independent psychological thriller Donnie Darko (2001), which became a cult film, as well as the drama Life as a House, and the miniseries Hitler: The Rise of Evil (2003). She subsequently starred in the dark comedy Saved! (2004) before being cast as Lydia Bennet in Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride & Prejudice (2005). Malone continued to appear in both independent and mainstream features throughout the 2000s, with supporting roles in the dramas The Ballad of Jack and Rose (2005), Into the Wild (2007), and the horror film The Ruins (2008). In the late 2000s Malone ventured into music, releasing a single as Jena Malone and the Blood Stains in 2007. The following year she began performing street shows with a musical project called The Shoe, which features Malone performing with various instruments contained in a steamer trunk. Malone made her foray into action films with Zack Snyder's Sucker Punch (2011) and was subsequently cast as Johanna Mason in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013), a role she reprised in two sequels between 2014 and 2015. She was then cast in supporting roles in Nicolas Winding Refn's psychological horror film The Neon Demon and Tom Ford's thriller Nocturnal Animals (both 2016). Early life Malone was born on November 21, 1984, in Sparks, Nevada, the daughter of Deborah Malone and Edward Berge. Her father is of partly Norwegian descent; she also has Irish ancestry. According to Malone, her mother became pregnant with her after a one-night stand with her father, who was married to another woman at the time. Malone was raised by her mother and her mother's girlfriend. \\"They were lovers,\\" Malone has said. \\"I had two moms, and it was awesome.\\" She remained estranged from her father for much of her early life but reconciled with him in adulthood. Malone grew up impoverished; her family relocated frequently and at times was homeless. \\"We were just so poor,\\" Malone has said. \\"We'd hop out of apartments, lose jobs, find a cheaper place, get kicked out, live in cars, and live in hotels.\\" By the time she was nine years old, she had lived in 27 locations. Despite the frequent moves, Malone said, \\"I don't think it was a tough childhood... it prepared me for this strange, gypsy lifestyle of an actor. It's a beautiful thing to give children diversity of where to live and how to live; it makes you believe that security is built within instead of four concrete walls that you call a home.\\" As a child, Malone first began taking an interest in acting while watching her mother perform in community theater in the Lake Tahoe area. In 1995 she moved to Las Vegas, where she resided with her family for nine months, and began taking acting classes while her mother worked in a call center. She subsequently persuaded her mother to move to Los Angeles so she could pursue an acting career. Malone has said that she and her mother struggled financially in Los Angeles. She was home-schooled from sixth to eighth grade and attended the Professional Children's School in New York City for ninth grade. She has one younger maternal half-sister, Madison Mae Malone (born 1997). Career =1996‚Äì2003: Career beginnings= Malone progressed to professional acting with the film Bastard Out of Carolina (1996). She was nominated at the 1996 Independent Spirit Awards for Best Debut Performance and at the third Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Television Movie or Miniseries for her role in the film. From there her roles grew to include several Hollywood features. In 1997 she was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category Best Actress in a Miniseries or Television Film for her role in the television film Hope (1997), portraying a young girl growing up in a small town in the 1960s. After completing Hope Malone was cast in Robert Zemeckis's science fiction film Contact (1997), playing the child counterpart of Jodie Foster's lead character. For her portrayal she won a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. The following year Malone was cast opposite Susan Sarandon and Julia Roberts in the drama Stepmom (1998), playing an adolescent girl whose father has remarried and whose mother is dying of terminal cancer. The film was a box office success, grossing over $150 million against a $50 million budget. In 1999 Malone filed for legal emancipation from her mother in a Los Angeles County Court, and subsequently alleged that her mother had mismanaged her earnings, spending $280,000 of her trust account. She was granted legal emancipation in January 2000. After dropping out of high school in 1999, Malone obtained a General Educational Development certificate in 2001. Malone had her first cinematic leading role in the psychological science fiction thriller film Donnie Darko (2001), playing Gretchen Ross, the new girl in town who becomes the girlfriend of Jake Gyllenhaal's title character. Though the film was not a box-office hit, it later gained notoriety as a cult film. The same year she had a supporting part in the drama Life as a House (2001), portraying the girlfriend of a young man (Hayden Christensen) whose ailing father (Kevin Kline) is building a home. Malone co-produced the independent comedy-drama American Girl (2002), the first feature in which she had top billing, co-starring with Brad Renfro and Alicia Witt as a suicidal young woman whose father is in prison. In 2002 Malone played the part of a Catholic schoolgirl with a painful secret opposite Emile Hirsch in The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys, also featuring Vincent D'Onofrio and Jodie Foster. In 2003, Jena appeared as ‚Äúferry girl‚Äù in Cold Mountain. =2004‚Äì2012: Subsequent films, music, and theater= Malone had top billing in the dark comedy Saved! (2004), in which she portrayed a Christian high school student who discovers her boyfriend is gay. The same year she starred in the ecological-themed independent thriller film Corn, about a young woman who returns to her family's farm to find that their sheep are being driven mad by corn modified to be immune to pesticides. Ronnie Scheib of Variety praised her performance, writing: \\"With Corn Jena Malone proves conclusively that she can carry a movie.\\" Malone was subsequently cast as Lydia Bennet in Joe Wright's adaptation of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice (2005). Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote, \\"Malone, as the saucy, boy-crazy youngest daughter, Lydia, offers an amusing caricature of teenage idiocy and entitlement.\\" The same year she had a supporting role in Rebecca Miller's drama The Ballad of Jack and Rose. In 2006 Malone made her Broadway stage debut as Sister James in a production of the Tony Award-winning play Doubt. Ben Brantley of The New York Times wrote that Malone \\"slides effortlessly and appealingly into the part of the dewy, impressionable Sister James.\\" She also appeared in films, co-starring with Chlo√´ Sevigny in filmmaker M. Blash's improvised feature Lying (2006), playing one of several women attending a precarious weekend gathering. Malone followed this with supporting roles in the independent comedy The Go-Getter (2007), playing a young woman reunited with her middle school crush, and the biographical drama Into the Wild (2007), in which she portrayed the sister of Chris McCandless. Malone performing with Jena Malone and the Blood Stains, 2008 In 2007 it was announced that Malone was releasing her first single on The Social Registry, a New York City experimental music label, as Jena Malone and the Bloodstains. A number of tracks were subsequently posted to her MySpace page. Pitchfork Media has described Malone's music as \\"pretty out-there‚Äîbedroom electronics, spaced-out keyboards, and Malone's spare vocals.\\" In 2008 she formed the musical project The Shoe, which features Malone performing with a series of electronic instruments contained within a steamer trunk. She began performing impromptu live shows on street corners in 2008. Malone appeared in the supernatural horror film The Ruins (2008) opposite Shawn Ashmore and Jonathan Tucker, playing one of several backpackers in Mexico who become trapped on a Mayan temple teeming with vines that can animate and attack those who come into contact with them. The following year she returned to theater, portraying Lavinia in an off- Broadway revival of Eugene O'Neill's play Mourning Becomes Electra, opposite Lili Taylor. In 2011 Malone played the role of Rocket in Zack Snyder's action film Sucker Punch. The film's commercial failure caused Malone to reevaluate her career and consider focusing on photography and music. After the success of her next role, in The History Channel's miniseries Hatfields and McCoys, Malone's passion for acting returned. In 2012 Malone starred in Dakota, a series on the YouTube channel Wigs, portraying the title character. She was attached to play Carson McCullers in the film Lonely Hunter, directed by Deborah Kampmeir, and had a supporting role in the independent drama In Our Nature (2012) opposite Zach Gilford and Gabrielle Union, playing one of several young people on a couples' getaway. =2013‚Äìpresent: Mainstream films and other endeavors= Malone at the 2013 San Diego Comic Con In 2013 Malone reunited with M. Blash and co-star Chlo√´ Sevigny in the independent drama The Wait, portraying the sister of a woman who believes their dead mother will be resurrected. The same year she was cast as Johanna Mason in The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (2013). In 2014 Malone exhibited 39 photographs she had taken in Myanmar that summer.'Outlook Beverly Hills', The Beverly Hills Courier, Volume XXXXVIIII, Number 46, November 21, 2014, p. 22 The exhibition, which ran from November 21 to 28, was called \\"The Holy Other.\\" It took place at MAMA, an art gallery owned by Malone's friend Adarsha Benjamin in Downtown Los Angeles. Proceeds were donated to Girl Determined, a nonprofit organization that benefits girls' education in Myanmar. Also in 2014 Malone had a supporting role in Paul Thomas Anderson's neo-noir film Inherent Vice (2014), portraying an ex-heroin addict who hires a detective (Joaquin Phoenix) to find her husband. Malone also reprised the role of Johanna Mason in two Hunger Games sequels, Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 1 (2014) and Mockingjay ‚Äì Part 2 (2015). Malone was cast as Jenet Klyburn in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice, also directed by Zack Snyder. Her scenes were left out of the theatrical release but included on the \\"Ultimate Edition\\" home video release. In February 2015 Malone was cast alongside Elle Fanning in Nicolas Winding Refn's horror film The Neon Demon, which focuses on an aspiring model in Los Angeles. The film garnered criticism for a scene in which Malone engages in necrophilia. The Telegraphs Tim Robey deemed it the \\"most offensive film of the year\\" but conceded it was not \\"any fault of Malone's, who commits herself utterly to making it an anguished, desperate, if inevitably revolting minute or so of screen time. It's a question of context, and how this scene... slots into the film's overall thesis.\\" Malone co-starred with Riley Keough in So Yong Kim's drama film Lovesong (2016), playing a young woman who falls in love with her female best friend. Kate Erbland of IndieWire wrote that \\"Malone is at her most effervescent and appealing\\" but that \\"the overall effect is one of a disjointed love story that can never quite find the tune, no matter how skilled its players.\\" Malone is credited as co-writer and featured vocalist on the Foster the People track \\"Static Space Lover\\" from the band's third album, Sacred Hearts Club, released on July 21, 2017. Personal life In 2000, at age 15, after appearing in \\"Contact‚Ä≥ and \\"Stepmom,‚Ä≥ Jena Malone won legal emancipation from her mother after accusing the woman of squandering Ms. Malone‚Äôs earnings through \\"excessive spending and mismanagement,‚Ä≥ according to court papers. In 2003, at age 19, Malone purchased a home in Lake Tahoe, Nevada, where she resided as of 2012. In May 2016 Malone gave birth to a son, Ode Mountain, with her boyfriend, photographer Ethan DeLorenzo. The couple announced their engagement on August 30, 2016. In February 2019, Malone and De Lorenzo ended their relationship. Malone endorsed Senator Bernie Sanders in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

The name derives from the shapes of the circuit diagrams, which look respectively like the letter Y and the Greek capital letter Œî. This circuit transformation theory was published by Arthur Edwin Kennelly in 1899.A.E. Kennelly, \\"Equivalence of triangles and three-pointed stars in conducting networks\\", Electrical World and Engineer, vol. 34, pp. 413-414, 1899. It is widely used in analysis of three-phase electric power circuits. The Y-Œî transform can be considered a special case of the star-mesh transform for three resistors. In mathematics, the Y-Œî transform plays an important role in theory of circular planar graphs.E.B. Curtis, D. Ingerman, J.A. Morrow, Circular planar graphs and resistor networks, Linear Algebra and its Applications, vol. 238, pp. 115‚Äì150, 1998. Names Illustration of the transform in its T-Œ† representation. The Y-Œî transform is known by a variety of other names, mostly based upon the two shapes involved, listed in either order. The Y, spelled out as wye, can also be called T or star; the Œî, spelled out as delta, can also be called triangle, Œ† (spelled out as pi), or mesh. Thus, common names for the transformation include wye-delta or delta-wye, star-delta, star-mesh, or T-Œ†. Basic Y-Œî transformation Œî and Y circuits with the labels which are used in this article. The transformation is used to establish equivalence for networks with three terminals. Where three elements terminate at a common node and none are sources, the node is eliminated by transforming the impedances. For equivalence, the impedance between any pair of terminals must be the same for both networks. The equations given here are valid for complex as well as real impedances. =Equations for the transformation from Œî to Y= The general idea is to compute the impedance R_\\\\text{Y} at a terminal node of the Y circuit with impedances R', R to adjacent nodes in the Œî circuit by :R_\\\\text{Y} = \\\\frac{R'R}{\\\\sum R_\\\\Delta} where R_\\\\Delta are all impedances in the Œî circuit. This yields the specific formulae :\\\\begin{align} R_1 &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] R_2 &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] R_3 &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}} \\\\end{align} =Equations for the transformation from Y to Œî= The general idea is to compute an impedance R_\\\\Delta in the Œî circuit by :R_\\\\Delta = \\\\frac{R_P}{R_\\\\text{opposite}} where R_P = R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1 is the sum of the products of all pairs of impedances in the Y circuit and R_\\\\text{opposite} is the impedance of the node in the Y circuit which is opposite the edge with R_\\\\Delta. The formulae for the individual edges are thus :\\\\begin{align} R_\\\\text{a} &= \\\\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] R_\\\\text{b} &= \\\\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] R_\\\\text{c} &= \\\\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_2 R_3 + R_3 R_1}{R_3} \\\\end{align} Or, if using admittance instead of resistance: :\\\\begin{align} Y_\\\\text{a} &= \\\\frac{Y_3 Y_2}{\\\\sum Y_\\\\text{Y}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] Y_\\\\text{b} &= \\\\frac{Y_3 Y_1}{\\\\sum Y_\\\\text{Y}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] Y_\\\\text{c} &= \\\\frac{Y_1 Y_2}{\\\\sum Y_\\\\text{Y}} \\\\end{align} Note that the general formula in Y to Œî using admittance is similar to Œî to Y using resistance. A proof of the existence and uniqueness of the transformation The feasibility of the transformation can be shown as a consequence of the superposition theorem for electric circuits. A short proof, rather than one derived as a corollary of the more general star-mesh transform, can be given as follows. The equivalence lies in the statement that for any external voltages (V_1, V_2 and V_3) applying at the three nodes (N_1, N_2 and N_3), the corresponding currents (I_1, I_2 and I_3) are exactly the same for both the Y and Œî circuit, and vice versa. In this proof, we start with given external currents at the nodes. According to the superposition theorem, the voltages can be obtained by studying the superposition of the resulting voltages at the nodes of the following three problems applied at the three nodes with current: # \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_1 - I_2\\\\right), -\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_1 - I_2\\\\right), 0 # 0,\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_2 - I_3\\\\right), -\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_2 - I_3\\\\right) and # -\\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_3 - I_1\\\\right), 0, \\\\frac{1}{3}\\\\left(I_3 - I_1\\\\right) The equivalence can be readily shown by using Kirchhoff's circuit laws that I_1 + I_2 + I_3 = 0. Now each problem is relatively simple, since it involves only one single ideal current source. To obtain exactly the same outcome voltages at the nodes for each problem, the equivalent resistances in the two circuits must be the same, this can be easily found by using the basic rules of series and parallel circuits: : R_3 + R_1 = \\\\frac{\\\\left(R_\\\\text{c} + R_\\\\text{a}\\\\right)R_\\\\text{b}}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}},\\\\quad \\\\frac{R_3}{R_1} = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}}{R_\\\\text{c}}. Though usually six equations are more than enough to express three variables (R_1, R_2, R_3) in term of the other three variables(R_\\\\text{a}, R_\\\\text{b}, R_\\\\text{c}), here it is straightforward to show that these equations indeed lead to the above designed expressions. In fact, the superposition theorem establishes the relation between the values of the resistances, the uniqueness theorem guarantees the uniqueness of such solution. Simplification of networks Resistive networks between two terminals can theoretically be simplified to a single equivalent resistor (more generally, the same is true of impedance). Series and parallel transforms are basic tools for doing so, but for complex networks such as the bridge illustrated here, they do not suffice. The Y-Œî transform can be used to eliminate one node at a time and produce a network that can be further simplified, as shown. Transformation of a bridge resistor network, using the Y-Œî transform to eliminate node D, yields an equivalent network that may readily be simplified further. The reverse transformation, Œî-Y, which adds a node, is often handy to pave the way for further simplification as well. Transformation of a bridge resistor network, using the Œî-Y transform, also yields an equivalent network that may readily be simplified further. Every two-terminal network represented by a planar graph can be reduced to a single equivalent resistor by a sequence of series, parallel, Y-Œî, and Œî-Y transformations.Klaus Truemper. On the delta-wye reduction for planar graphs. J. Graph Theory 13(2):141‚Äì148, 1989. However, there are non-planar networks that cannot be simplified using these transformations, such as a regular square grid wrapped around a torus, or any member of the Petersen family. Graph theory In graph theory, the Y-Œî transform means replacing a Y subgraph of a graph with the equivalent Œî subgraph. The transform preserves the number of edges in a graph, but not the number of vertices or the number of cycles. Two graphs are said to be Y-Œî equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of Y-Œî transforms in either direction. For example, the Petersen family is a Y-Œî equivalence class. Demonstration =Œî-load to Y-load transformation equations= Œî and Y circuits with the labels that are used in this article. To relate \\\\left\\\\\\\\{R_\\\\text{a}, R_\\\\text{b}, R_\\\\text{c}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} from Œî to \\\\left\\\\\\\\{R_1, R_2, R_3\\\\right\\\\\\\\} from Y, the impedance between two corresponding nodes is compared. The impedance in either configuration is determined as if one of the nodes is disconnected from the circuit. The impedance between N1 and N2 with N3 disconnected in Œî: :\\\\begin{align} R_\\\\Delta\\\\left(N_1, N_2\\\\right) &= R_\\\\text{c} \\\\parallel (R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b}) \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &= \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{c}} + \\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b}}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{c}\\\\left(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b}\\\\right)}{R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}} \\\\end{align} To simplify, let R_\\\\text{T} be the sum of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{R_\\\\text{a}, R_\\\\text{b}, R_\\\\text{c}\\\\right\\\\\\\\}. : R_\\\\text{T} = R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c} Thus, :R_\\\\Delta\\\\left(N_1, N_2\\\\right) = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{c}(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b})}{R_\\\\text{T}} The corresponding impedance between N1 and N2 in Y is simple: :R_\\\\text{Y}\\\\left(N_1, N_2\\\\right) = R_1 + R_2 hence: :R_1 + R_2 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{c}(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b})}{R_\\\\text{T}} (1) Repeating for R(N_2,N_3): :R_2 + R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}(R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c})}{R_\\\\text{T}} (2) and for R\\\\left(N_1, N_3\\\\right): :R_1 + R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}\\\\left(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{c}\\\\right)}{R_\\\\text{T}}. (3) From here, the values of \\\\left\\\\\\\\{R_1, R_2, R_3\\\\right\\\\\\\\} can be determined by linear combination (addition and/or subtraction). For example, adding (1) and (3), then subtracting (2) yields :\\\\begin{align} R_1 + R_2 + R_1 + R_3 - R_2 - R_3 &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{c}(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b})}{R_\\\\text{T}} + \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{c})}{R_\\\\text{T}} - \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}(R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c})}{R_\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] {}\\\\Rightarrow 2R_1 &= \\\\frac{2R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} \\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\[3pt] {}\\\\Rightarrow R_1 &= \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}}. \\\\end{align} For completeness: :R_1 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} (4) :R_2 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} (5) :R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}}{R_\\\\text{T}} (6) =Y-load to Œî-load transformation equations= Let :R_\\\\text{T} = R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}. We can write the Œî to Y equations as :R_1 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} (1) :R_2 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} (2) :R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}}{R_\\\\text{T}}. (3) Multiplying the pairs of equations yields :R_1 R_2 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}^2 }{R_\\\\text{T}^2} (4) :R_1 R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}^2 R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}^2} (5) :R_2 R_3 = \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}^2 R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}^2} (6) and the sum of these equations is :R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3 = \\\\frac{ R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}^2 + R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}^2R_\\\\text{c} + R_\\\\text{a}^2R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}} {R_\\\\text{T}^2} (7) Factor R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c} from the right side, leaving R_\\\\text{T} in the numerator, canceling with an R_\\\\text{T} in the denominator. :\\\\begin{align} R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3 &={} \\\\frac{ \\\\left(R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}\\\\right) \\\\left(R_\\\\text{a} + R_\\\\text{b} + R_\\\\text{c}\\\\right) }{R_\\\\text{T}^2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &={} \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} \\\\end{align} (8) Note the similarity between (8) and {(1), (2), (3)} Divide (8) by (1) :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{R_1 R_2 + R_1 R_3 + R_2 R_3}{R_1} &={} \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{a}R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}}{R_\\\\text{T}} \\\\frac{R_\\\\text{T}}{R_\\\\text{b}R_\\\\text{c}} \\\\\\\\\\\\ &={} R_\\\\text{a}, \\\\end{align} which is the equation for R_\\\\text{a}. Dividing (8) by (2) or (3) (expressions for R_2 or R_3) gives the remaining equations.

Life and career Slack was born in Westby, Wisconsin.Freddie Slack Discography at Discogs Retrieved 2018-10-31. He learned to play drums as a boy. Later he took up the xylophone, and at the age of 13 he changed to the piano. He studied with a local teacher throughout high school. At the age of 17 he moved with his parents to Chicago, where he continued his musical training. He met Rosy McHargue, a well-known clarinetist, who took him to hear many leading musicians, including Bix Beiderbecke and Earl Hines. His first job was with Johnny Tobin at the Beach View Gardens. He later moved to Los Angeles, where he worked with Henry Halstead, Earl Burtnett and Lennie Hayton, before joining Ben Pollack in 1934. He played with the Jimmy Dorsey Band in the 1930s and was a charter member of the Will Bradley Orchestra when it formed in 1939. Known to bandmates as \\"Daddy Slack,\\" he played the piano solo on Bradley's recording of \\"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\\", one of the early white boogie-woogie hits and a classic of the Big Band era. He formed his own band in 1942 and signed with the newly founded Capitol Records. He recorded three songs at his third recording session for Capitol, on May 21, 1942. His recording of \\"Cow Cow Boogie,\\" sung by the 17-year-old Ella Mae Morse, was the second record Capitol issued on July 1, and by July 25 it had reached number 1 on the Hit Parade. It was Capitol's first gold single.[ Ella Mae Morse's biography at allmusic] T-Bone Walker was a member of Slack's band from 1942 to 1944 and Slack later accompanied Walker on his first solo recording for Capitol, \\"Mean Old World\\".T-Bone Walker biography at Tunegenie This band also had a hit with \\"Strange Cargo.\\" Slack continued to record with Capitol until at least 1950, recording some 80 tracks for the label.Mosaic Records Slack also recorded as an accompanist for Big Joe Turner, Johnny Mercer, Margaret Whiting and Lisa Morrow. In the original version of the song \\"Down the Road a Piece\\", recorded in 1940 by the Will Bradley Orchestra, Slack is mentioned in the lyrics: > If you wanna' hear some boogie then I know the place > It's just an old piano and a knocked-out bass. > The drummer-man's a guy they call 8-beat Mack > You remember Doc and old \\"Beat Me Daddy\\" Slack. > Man it's better than chicken fried in bacon grease > Come along with me boy, it's just down the road a piece. > \\"Eight Beat Mack\\" refers to drummer Ray McKinley, and \\"Doc\\" refers to the band's bass player, Doc Goldberg. His 1955 album Boogie Woogie on the 88 featured a horn section including jazz musicians Shorty Sherock and Herbie Harper among others, and with arrangements by Benny Carter. He also co-wrote the 1945 classic \\"The House of Blue Lights\\" first recorded with singer Ella Mae Morse, and later by Chuck Miller, The Andrews Sisters, Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. On August 10, 1965, Slack was found dead in his bedroom from undetermined causes.

Sauckel was among the 24 persons accused in the Nuremberg Trial of the Major War Criminals before the International Military Tribunal. He was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and was sentenced to death by hanging. Early life He was born in Ha√üfurt (Kingdom of Bavaria), the only child of a postman and a seamstress. Sauckel was educated at local schools and left early when his mother fell ill. He joined the merchant marine of Norway and Sweden when he was 15, first on a Norwegian three-masted schooner, and later on Swedish and German vessels. He went on to sail throughout the world, rising to the rank of Vollmatrose (able seaman). At the outbreak of World War I, he was on a German vessel en route to Australia when the vessel was captured. He was subsequently interned in France from August 1914 until November 1919. He returned to Germany, found factory work in Schweinfurt, and studied engineering in Ilmenau from 1922 to 1923. He joined the National Socialist German Workers Party (NSDAP) in 1923 (member 1,395). In 1924 he married Elisabeth Wetzel, with whom he had ten children. He remained a party member despite its forced dissolution in 1923 and publicly rejoined in 1925. Sauckel was appointed party Gauleiter of Th√ºringia on 30 September 1927 and became a member of the regional government in 1929. Following Hitler's appointment as Chancellor in 1933, he was promoted to Reichsregent von Th√ºringen (\\"Reich Regent of Th√ºringia\\") and Reichstag member. He served as the Reichsstatthalter of Thuringia from 5 May 1933 to 1945 and the acting Reichsstatthalter of Anhalt and Brunswick from 1935 to 1937.Der Gro√üe Ploetz: Die Enzyklop√§die der Weltgeschichte, Verlag Herder GmbH, 2019, Page 978, . He was also given an honorary rank of Obergruppenf√ºhrer in the SA in 1937. World War II Woman with Ostarbeiter badge in Auschwitz During World War II, he was named Reich defence commissioner for the Kassel district (Reichsverteidigungskommissar Wehrkreis IX) in September 1939. A member of the SS since 1934, he was promoted to honorary SS-Obergruppenf√ºhrer on 30 January 1942 before being appointed General Plenipotentiary for Labour Deployment (Generalbevollm√§chtigter f√ºr den Arbeitseinsatz) on 21 March 1942, on the recommendation of Martin Bormann.Karl H√∂ffkes: Hitlers Politische Generale. Die Gauleiter des Dritten Reiches: ein biographisches Nachschlagewerk. Grabert-Verlag, T√ºbingen 1986, p.282, . Slave and forced labour Sauckel worked directly under G√∂ring through the Four Year Plan Office, directing and controlling German labour. In response to increased demands, he met the requirement for manpower with people from the occupied territories. Voluntary numbers were insufficient and forced recruitment was introduced within a few months. Of the five million foreign workers brought to Germany, around 200,000 came voluntarily, according to Sauckel's testimony at Nuremberg. The majority of the acquired workers originated from the Eastern territories, especially in Poland and the Soviet Union where the methods used to gain workers were very harsh. The Wehrmacht was used to pressgang local people and most were taken by force to the Reich. Conditions of work were extremely poor and discipline severe, especially for concentration camp prisoners. All the latter were unpaid and provided with starvation rations, barely keeping those workers alive. Such slave labour was widely used in many German industries, including coal mining, steel making, and armaments manufacture. The use of forced and slave labour increased throughout the war, especially after Albert Speer came to replace Fritz Todt in charge of armaments production in February 1942 and demanded much more labour from Sauckel. Trial and execution Sauckel's body after execution, October 16, 1946 At the Nuremberg trials, Sauckel was accused of conspiracy to commit crimes against peace; planning, initiating and waging wars of aggression; war crimes and crimes against humanity. He defended the Arbeitseinsatz as \\"nothing to do with exploitation. It is an economic process for supplying labour\\". He denied that it was slave labour or that it was common to deliberately work people to death (extermination by labour) or to mistreat them. Robert Servatius, Sauckel's counsel, portrayed Sauckel as a representative of the labour classes of Germany; an earnest and unpretentious party man assiduously committed to promoting the collective utility of the working class. This portrait was contrary to that of Speer, whom Servatius juxtaposed against Sauckel as a technical genius and entrepreneurial administrator. Sauckel surmised that Speer bore greater legal and moral responsibility by virtue of the fact that the former merely met the demands of the latter, in accordance with protocol. This strategy did not yield to his favour, however, as the ratio in the final judgement against the respective defendants outlined that Speer's tasks were numerous, with the forced labour program comprising only one facet of his ministerial responsibilities, while Sauckel was singularly responsible for his office as General Plenipotentiary. Sauckel was found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity, and he, together with a number of colleagues, was hanged at Nuremberg Prison on 16 October 1946, 11 days before his 52nd birthday. His last words were recorded as \\"Ich sterbe unschuldig, mein Urteil ist ungerecht. Gott besch√ºtze Deutschland. M√∂ge es leben und eines Tages wieder gro√ü werden. Gott besch√ºtze meine Familie.\\" (\\"I die an innocent man, my sentence is unjust. God protect Germany. May it live and one day become great again. God protect my family.\\"). Albert Speer escaped the death sentence, but served 20 years at Spandau prison. Sauckel's body, as were those of the other nine executed men and the corpse of Hermann G√∂ring, was cremated at Ostfriedhof (Munich) and the ashes were scattered in the river Isar.

In mathematical terms, it is an injective function. Perfect hash functions may be used to implement a lookup table with constant worst-case access time. A perfect hash function has many of the same applications as other hash functions, but with the advantage that no collision resolution has to be implemented. In addition, if the keys are not the data, the keys do not need to be stored in the lookup table, saving space. Application A perfect hash function with values in a limited range can be used for efficient lookup operations, by placing keys from (or other associated values) in a lookup table indexed by the output of the function. One can then test whether a key is present in , or look up a value associated with that key, by looking for it at its cell of the table. Each such lookup takes constant time in the worst case. Construction A perfect hash function for a specific set that can be evaluated in constant time, and with values in a small range, can be found by a randomized algorithm in a number of operations that is proportional to the size of S. The original construction of uses a two-level scheme to map a set of elements to a range of indices, and then map each index to a range of hash values. The first level of their construction chooses a large prime (larger than the size of the universe from which is drawn), and a parameter , and maps each element of to the index :g(x)=(kx\\\\bmod p)\\\\bmod n. If is chosen randomly, this step is likely to have collisions, but the number of elements that are simultaneously mapped to the same index is likely to be small. The second level of their construction assigns disjoint ranges of integers to each index . It uses a second set of linear modular functions, one for each index , to map each member of into the range associated with . As show, there exists a choice of the parameter such that the sum of the lengths of the ranges for the different values of is . Additionally, for each value of , there exists a linear modular function that maps the corresponding subset of into the range associated with that value. Both , and the second-level functions for each value of , can be found in polynomial time by choosing values randomly until finding one that works. The hash function itself requires storage space to store , , and all of the second-level linear modular functions. Computing the hash value of a given key may be performed in constant time by computing , looking up the second-level function associated with , and applying this function to . A modified version of this two-level scheme with a larger number of values at the top level can be used to construct a perfect hash function that maps into a smaller range of length . Space lower bounds The use of words of information to store the function of is near-optimal: any perfect hash function that can be calculated in constant time requires at least a number of bits that is proportional to the size of .. Extensions =Dynamic perfect hashing= Using a perfect hash function is best in situations where there is a frequently queried large set, , which is seldom updated. This is because any modification of the set may cause the hash function to no longer be perfect for the modified set. Solutions which update the hash function any time the set is modified are known as dynamic perfect hashing,. but these methods are relatively complicated to implement. =Minimal perfect hash function= A minimal perfect hash function is a perfect hash function that maps keys to consecutive integers ‚Äì usually the numbers from to or from to . A more formal way of expressing this is: Let and be elements of some finite set . Then is a minimal perfect hash function if and only if implies (injectivity) and there exists an integer such that the range of is . It has been proven that a general purpose minimal perfect hash scheme requires at least 1.44 bits/key.. The best currently known minimal perfect hashing schemes can be represented using less than 1.56 bits/key if given enough time. . =Order preservation= A minimal perfect hash function is order preserving if keys are given in some order and for any keys and , implies . In this case, the function value is just the position of each key in the sorted ordering of all of the keys. A simple implementation of order-preserving minimal perfect hash functions with constant access time is to use an (ordinary) perfect hash function or cuckoo hashing to store a lookup table of the positions of each key. If the keys to be hashed are themselves stored in a sorted array, it is possible to store a small number of additional bits per key in a data structure that can be used to compute hash values quickly.. Order-preserving minimal perfect hash functions require necessarily bits to be represented.. Related constructions A simple alternative to perfect hashing, which also allows dynamic updates, is cuckoo hashing. This scheme maps keys to two or more locations within a range (unlike perfect hashing which maps each key to a single location) but does so in such a way that the keys can be assigned one- to-one to locations to which they have been mapped. Lookups with this scheme are slower, because multiple locations must be checked, but nevertheless take constant worst-case time..  References   Further reading  *Richard J. Cichelli.

In the 1980s, Pickover proposed that experimental mathematicians and computer artists examine the behavior of orbit trajectories for the Mandelbrot in order to study how closely the orbits of interior points come to the x and y axes in the complex plane. In some renditions of this behavior, the closer that the point approaches, the higher up the color scale, with red denoting the closest approach. The logarithm of the distance is taken to accentuate the details.

As an example, 1260 is a vampire number because it can be expressed as 21 √ó 60 = 1260. Note that the digits of the factors 21 and 60 can be found, in some scrambled order, in 1260.

The term is a metonym for the line (or \\"bar\\") that separates the parts of a courtroom reserved for spectators and those reserved for participants in a trial such as lawyers. Courtroom division The wooden bar in front of the magistrate's bench in an 18th-century outdoor courtroom in Belgium The origin of the term bar is from the barring furniture dividing a medieval European courtroom. In the US, Europe and many other countries referring to the law traditions of Europe, the area in front of the barrage is restricted to participants in the trial: the judge or judges, other court officials, the jury (if any), the lawyers for each party, the parties to the case, and witnesses giving testimony. The area behind the bar is open to the public. This restriction is enforced in nearly all courts. In most courts, the bar is represented by a physical partition: a railing or barrier that serves as a bar. License and certification The bar may also refer to the qualifying procedure by which a lawyer is licensed to practice law in a given jurisdiction. =U.S. procedure= In the United States, this procedure is administered by the individual U.S. states. In general, a candidate must graduate from a qualified law school and pass a written test: the bar examination. Almost all states use the Multistate Bar Examination (MBE), a multiple-choice exam administered on one day of a two- or three-day test, and an increasing number use the Uniform Bar Examination, which includes the MBE. In either case, on days during which the MBE is not administered, the bar exam will include questions related to that state's laws. The candidate is then admitted to the bar. A lawyer whose license to practice law is revoked is said to be disbarred.  U.S. patent procedure  Admission to practice before the patent section of the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) requires that the individual pass a separate, single-day examination administered by that agency. This test is typically referred to as the \\"patent bar\\", although the word \\"bar\\" does not appear in the test's official name. Unlike the general bar examination, for which graduation from a recognized law school is a prerequisite, the USPTO exam does not require that the candidate have taken any law school courses. Instead, the main prerequisite is a science or engineering background, most often met with a bachelor's degree in a relevant field. Individuals who pass the examination are referred to as \\"patent attorneys\\" if they have an active law license from any U.S. jurisdiction, and \\"patent agents\\" otherwise. Attorneys and agents have the same license to represent clients before the patent section of the USPTO, and both may issue patentability opinions. However, any other patent-related practice (such as licensing or infringement litigation) can only be performed by licensed attorneys‚Äîwho do not necessarily have to be USPTO-licensed. =British procedure= In the United Kingdom, the practice of law is divided between barristers (advocates in Scotland) and solicitors. It is usually the former who appear in an advocacy role before the court. When a lawyer becomes an advocate or barrister, he/she is called to the bar. In Britain the bar is differentiated between the inner bar (for Queen's counsel) and the outer bar (for Junior barristers). The legal profession The bar commonly refers to the legal profession as a whole. With a modifier, it may refer to a branch or division of the profession: as, for instance, the tort bar‚Äîlawyers who specialize in filing civil suits for damages. In conjunction with bench, bar may differentiate lawyers who represent clients (the bar) from judges or members of a judiciary (the bench). In this sense, the bar advocates and the bench adjudicates. Yet, judges commonly remain members of the bar and lawyers are commonly referenced as Officers of the Court. The phrase bench and bar denotes all judges and lawyers collectively.

She is remembered as a powerful orator. Parsons entered the radical movement following her marriage to newspaper editor Albert Parsons and moved with him from Texas to Chicago, where she contributed to the newspaper he famously edited The Alarm. Following her husband's 1887 execution in conjunction with the Haymarket affair, Parsons remained a leading American radical activist, as a founder of the Industrial Workers of the World and member of other political organizations. Biography =Early life= Lucy Parsons was born Lucia Carter in Virginia in 1851. Her mother was an African-American slave owned by a white man named Tolliver, who may have been Lucy's father. In 1863, during the Civil War, Tolliver relocated to Waco, Texas with his slaves. Little is known about her life following the move to Texas. She worked as a seamstress and a cook for white families. Parsons lived with or was married to a former slave, Oliver Gathing, for a time prior to 1870. During this relationship, she had an infant which died at birth. In 1871, she married Albert Parsons, a former Confederate soldier. They were forced to flee north from Texas in 1873 due to intolerant reactions to their interracial marriage. During the journey, Parsons altered her first name to Lucy. The couple settled in Chicago, Illinois. =Organizing= Described by the Chicago Police Department as \\"more dangerous than a thousand rioters\\" in the 1920s, Parsons and her husband had become highly effective anarchist organizers primarily involved in the labor movement in the late 19th century, but also participating in revolutionary activism on behalf of political prisoners, people of color, the homeless and women. She began writing for The Socialist and The Alarm, the journal of the International Working People's Association (IWPA) that she and Parsons, among others, founded in 1883. Parsons worked closely with her friend and collaborator Lizzie Holmes in the early years of the 1880s, and the two of them led marches of working seamstresses in Chicago. In 1886 her husband, who had been heavily involved in campaigning for the eight-hour day, was arrested, tried, and executed on November 11, 1887, by the state of Illinois on charges that he had conspired in the Haymarket Riot ‚Äî an event which was widely regarded as a political frame-up and which marked the beginning of May Day labor rallies in protest. Parsons was invited to write for the French anarchist journal Les Temps Nouveaux and spoke alongside William Morris and Peter Kropotkin during a visit to Great Britain in 1888. In 1892 she briefly published a periodical, Freedom: A Revolutionary Anarchist-Communist Monthly. She was often arrested for giving public speeches or distributing anarchist literature. While she continued championing the anarchist cause, she came into ideological conflict with some of her contemporaries, including Emma Goldman, over her focus on class politics over gender and sexual struggles.\\"Lucy Parsons: Woman Of Will.\\" Industrial Workers of the World. Photograph of Parsons in 1886 In 1905 she participated in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), and began editing the Liberator, an anarchist newspaper that supported the IWW in Chicago. Lucy's focus shifted somewhat to class struggles around poverty and unemployment, and she organized the Chicago Hunger Demonstrations in January 1915, which pushed the American Federation of Labor, the Socialist Party, and Jane Addams' Hull House to participate in a huge demonstration on February 12. Parsons was also quoted as saying: \\"My conception of the strike of the future is not to strike and go out and starve, but to strike and remain in, and take possession of the necessary property of production.\\"Wobblies! 14 Parsons anticipated the sit-down strikes in the US and, later, workers' factory takeovers in Argentina. In 1925 she began working with the National Committee of the International Labor Defense in 1927, a communist-led organization that defended labor activists and unjustly-accused African Americans such as the Scottsboro Nine and Angelo Herndon. While it is commonly accepted by nearly all biographical accounts (including those of the Lucy Parsons Center, the IWW, and Joe Knowles) that Parsons joined the Communist Party in 1939, there is some dispute, notably in Gale Ahrens' essay \\"Lucy Parsons: Mystery Revolutionist, More Dangerous Than A Thousand Rioters\\".Lucy Parsons: Freedom, Equality and Solidarity: Writings and Speeches, 1878‚Äì1937 Ahrens points out that the obituary the Communist Party had published on her death made no claim that she had been a member. =Conflict with Emma Goldman= 200px Emma Goldman and Lucy Parsons represented different generations of anarchism. This resulted in ideological and personal conflict. Carolyn Ashbaugh has explained their disagreements in depth: In 1908, after Captain Mahoney (of the New York City Police Department) crashed one of Goldman‚Äôs lectures in Chicago, newspaper headlines read that every popular anarchist had been present for the spectacle, \\"with the single exception of Lucy Parsons, with whom Emma Goldman is not on the best of terms.\\"Daily Tribune (March 17, 1908); quoted in Falk, Love, Anarchy, and Emma Goldman, p. 65 Goldman reciprocated Parsons‚Äôs absence by endorsing Frank Harris' book The Bomb, which was a largely fictional account of the Haymarket Affair and its martyrs' road to death. (Parsons had published The Famous Speeches of the Haymarket Martyrs, a non-fictional, first-hand recounting of the Haymarket martyrs' final speeches in court.) Parsons was solely dedicated to working class liberation, condemning Goldman for \\"addressing large middle- class audiences\\"; Goldman accused Parsons of riding upon the cape of her husband‚Äôs martyrdom. \\"[N]o doubt,\\" Candace Falk wrote (Love, Anarchy, and Emma Goldman), \\"there was an undercurrent of competitiveness between the two women. Emma generally preferred center stage.\\" Goldman planned on preserving her place in the spotlight as an American anarchist laureate by shoving risqu√© sexual and kinship discourse into \\"the center of a perennial debate among anarchists about the relative importance of such personal issues\\". In The Firebrand, Parsons wrote, \\"Mr. [Oscar] Rotter [a free love advocate] attempts to dig up the hideous 'Variety' grub and bind it to the beautiful unfolding blossom of labor's emancipation from wage-slavery and call them one and the same. Variety in sex relations and economic freedom have nothing in common.\\"Parsons, Lucy. \\"On Variety\\", The Firebrand, September 27, 1896, Free Society; also in Ashbaugh, 204. Goldman responded: Parsons responded: \\"The line will be drawn sharply at personalities as we know these enlighten no one and do infinitely more harm than good.\\"Parsons, Lucy. \\"Salutation to the Friends of Liberty\\", The Liberator Chicago, September 3, 1905; Lucy Parsons, Ahrens, ed., p. 88. Goldman, in her autobiography, Living My Life, briefly mentioned the presence of \\"Mrs. Lucy Parsons, widow of our martyred Albert Parsons\\", at a Chicago labor convention, noting that she \\"took an active part in the proceedings\\". Goldman later would acknowledge Albert Parsons for becoming a socialist and anarchist, proceeding to praise him for having \\"married a young mulatto\\"; there was no further mention of Lucy Parsons. =Death= Parsons continued to give fiery speeches in Chicago's Bughouse Square into her 80s, where she inspired Studs Terkel. One of her last major appearances was a speech to striking workers at International Harvester (the successor to the McCormick Harvesting Machine Company, whose striking workers played a role in the Haymarket Affair) in February 1941. Parsons died on March 7, 1942, in a house fire in the Avondale Community Area of Chicago. Her lover, George Markstall, died the next day from injuries he received while trying to save her. She was approximately 91 years old. After her death, police seized her library of over 1,500 books and all of her personal papers. She is buried near her husband at Waldheim Cemetery (now Forest Home Cemetery), near the Haymarket Martyrs' Monument in Forest Park, Illinois. Tombstone, Forest Home (formerly Waldheim) Cemetery, Forest Park, IL - Photographed May 1, 2015  Origins and ethnicity  Parsons refused to speak about her private life or origins. When asked for details about her history, she declared \\"I am not a candidate for office, and the public have no right to my past. I amount to nothing to the world and people care nothing of me. I am battling for a principle.\\" This stance has made research into her origins difficult for historians. Parsons specifically denied that she was a child of a former slave of African descent, claiming that she was born in Texas and her parents were Mexican and Native American. She described herself as a ‚ÄúSpanish-Indian maiden‚Äù to explain her dark complexion. These personal myths persisted after her death: on her death certificate, her parents' names were listed as Pedro D√≠az and Marites Gonz√°lez, both born in Mexico.Illinois, Deaths and Stillbirths Index, 1916-1947 Legacy, tributes and memorials The Lucy Parsons Center was founded in 1970 in Boston, Massachusetts. It continues as a collectively-run radical bookstore and infoshop. In the 1990s, a local Chicago artist installed a memorial to Parsons in Wicker Park.Howard Besser, \\"Lucy Parsons Memorial\\", April 3, 1996. In 2004, the City of Chicago named a park for her. On July 16, 2007, a book that purportedly belonged to Lucy Parsons was featured on a segment of the PBS television series, History Detectives. During the segment it was determined that the book, which was a biography of Albert Parsons' co-defendant August Spies' life and trial, was most likely a copy published and sold by Parsons as a means of raising money to prevent her husband's execution. The segment also provided background on Parsons' life and the Haymarket Affair. On October 15, 2015, a copy of William Morris's Signs of Change: Seven Lectures Delivered on Various Occasions was sold at auction in England. It was inscribed \\"To Lucy E Parsons from William Morris November 15, 1888\\", bore a \\"Property of Federal Bureau of Investigation US Department of Justice\\" stamp, and a \\"Surplus Library of Congress Duplicate\\" stamp; some of its pages showed traces of smoke damage.

He was born to German parents in New Zealand in 1869 and raised in Europe. After completing a brewing apprenticeship in Poland, he worked as a masterbrewer in Germany before being expelled for labor activities under Bismark's anti-socialist laws. In 1890 he moved to the United States, where he joined the Brewers Union. Trautmann was a key figure in the United Brewery Workers' Union in Milwaukee and the editor of the United Brewery Workers' German-language newspaper, Brauer Zeitung. He was expelled from that union for his participation in the founding IWW convention. In 1905, he joined with other industrial unionists to found the Industrial Workers of the World. Between 1905 and 1912, he mostly worked in the field as an organizer. In 1912, he broke with the IWW leadership over strike tactics and the alleged misuse of funds collected for the \\"Bread and Roses\\" strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. In 1913, Trautmann joined the so-called yellow IWW created by the Socialist Labor Party, which later became the Workers' International Industrial Union (WIIU), as a \\"full-time propagandist.\\"Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All, A History of the Industrial Workers of the World, University of Illinois Press Abridged, 2000, page 60 In 1922, Trautmann published a novel, Riot, drawing on his experiences as an IWW activist during the Pressed Steel Car Strike of 1909 in McKees Rocks (Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania). Early life Born in New Zealand into a German-American miner family in 1869. His father died when Trautmann was four years of age. When he was 14 he and his mother moved back to Europe where he worked as an apprentice to a brewer in Poland. At this brewery he had to work as many as hours as his brewmaster told him. It was during this time that Trautmann was exposed to the radical labor ideas that would become his life's work. Trautmann worked throughout Eastern Europe before settling in Germany. In Germany he was a vocal supporter of workers going through the same abuse in the brewing industry that he had gone through. In 1890 he was forced to leave Germany under the new anti-Socialist laws, which marked him as a dangerous radical. He decided to move to the United States as he already had family there. He moved to Massachusetts and continued to organize labor. He was very active in the United Brewery Worker Union. He was also very vocal against the American Federation of Labor, who he saw as being too conservative and not looking out for the interest of the worker. Time in IWW Trautmann was one of the founders of the Industrial Workers of the World. He helped write the Industrial Union Manifesto, one of the IWW's founding documents. While in the Industrial Workers of the World Trautmann worked as an organizer, propagandist, and for some time as secretary-treasurer. He was much more known for his essays than for his administrative skills. His works include One Big Union, Why Strikes are Lost & How to Win, and Industrial Unionism: The Hope of the Workers. He was thrust into a leadership role with the resignation of Eugene Debs from the union, and while he was a skilled writer his administrative skills were lacking. He could not keep a record of the members of the union (that is both the individuals and the different local branches of the IWW), and at the 1906 IWW convention, it was discovered that Trautmann had not been keeping a financial record for the entire year. His start in the IWW was also met with turbulent times. He failed many of his first attempts at organizing strikes. He switched his tactics to target primarily Eastern European immigrants, since he was also one. This lead him to the McKees Rocks strike, a strike in a steel town of Pennsylvania. Trautmann tried to keep the protests peaceful, but soon violence erupted. Five state troopers were killed, and Trautmann was arrested. Thousands of workers threatened to riot if he was not released, and their demands met. Eventually the factory operators met the workers' demands and Trautmann achieved his first labor victory. Trautmann was also a part of the schisms that happened during the 1910s in the IWW. In 1906 Trautmann, and his allies Vincent St. John, and Daniel DeLeon found themselves at odds with the President of the IWW, Charles Sherman. Sherman had a more conservative view (as far as unions went) and many in the IWW feared that he would allow the union to become more of an AFL type. Some members thought that Sherman would try to work within the confines of the capitalist system rather than trying to change the system as many in the IWW were trying to do. Trautmann and his allies were a proponent of \\"direct action\\", the use of strikes and sabotage to achieve the aims of the union. The Trautmann faction was able to rally enough to support to outvote Sherman and his supporters, and were able to take control of the IWW. With an even greater leadership role in the union Trautmann was soon seen as being out of his depth. He was replaced as an administrator by St. John. This allowed Trautmann to be a field organizer, a job that suited him much better. He was involved in the Lawrence Strike of 1912. Despite its success Tratumann no longer believed that the direct action approach of the IWW was the right idea, and in 1913, after a brief stint in DeLeon's Yellow IWW, he left the union for good. Post IWW Life Trautmann wrote a historical novel entitled Riot that was based on his experiences organizing the McKees Rocks strike. He abandoned radical politics and wrote America's Dilemma in which he said, \\"Millions of toilers are today agreed that not capitalism, not the employers of labor as a class, are the enemies of the workers so much as those who, claiming to spring from the ranks of the proletariat, have become the apostles of corruption, the promoters of crime, the fomentors of chaos and destruction.\\" He instead promoted peaceful labor reform, eventually ending up in Los Angeles where he worked on his autobiography and a New Deal highway project until his death in 1940.

The emblem of the Barak Armored Brigade is a red-bordered rhombus bearing a sword against a blue and white background depicting the Haifa coastline. The brigade has a long history beginning before the foundation of the State of Israel. In 1990 the brigade was the first to adopt the Merkava mark-III main battle tank, phasing out its older Centurion tanks. The brigade is now phasing out the mark-III tanks and by end of July 2020 will be using only mark-IVs. History A tank during a training day held in the Golan Heights for the 188th Armored Brigade Emblem of the Carmeli Brigade A Merkava Mk.3 company in training, northern Israel. Memorial in the Golan Heights The brigade was formed as the 2nd Brigade during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, when it was split off from the Levanoni Brigade. Named the Carmeli Brigade because it was led by Moshe Carmel, the brigade was an infantry formation operating in northern Palestine. It played an important part in Operation Hiram. After the IDF was formed, the Carmeli Brigade became its 18th Brigade. During the Sinai Campaign of 1956, the brigade was stationed along the Jordanian border, in case the Jordanians decided to open a second front, and was thus not involved in combat. It was shortly later assigned armored units to become the 45th Armored Brigade, also known as the \\"Barak Armored Brigade\\". It consisted of one tank battalion, two armored infantry battalions, a mortar battalion and reconnaissance units. The changeover was completed in 1962. During the Yom Kippur War, it played an important role defending Israel's border against the Syrian attack in the southern Golan Heights. 112 soldiers were killed in action, including the brigade commander. The brigade was almost completely destroyed. The main Syrian attack at 14:30‚Äì14:50 PM, confronted by the newly positioned 74th Tank Battalion, under the command of Lt.Col. Yair Nafshi. Nafshi moved his battalion position 1.5 km forward from its previous defensive position, a maneuver that saved his men and machines from the Syrian artillery barrage. His was the only remaining tank force, equipped with 36 Israeli modified Centurion tanks to fight the Syrians for 3 continuous days, until reinforcements and reserves were moved into positions. His battalion was reinforced with a tank company from the 53rd battalion. After 4 days of fighting, his battalion was reduced to 5 operational tanks. More than 102 soldiers and officers died defending the southern Golan Line, from reinforced points (bunkers) 107 to 114. For his gallant, professional, and courageous behavior during the war, Yair Nafshi received Israel's second highest decoration, the Medal of Valor. He retired from the army with the rank of Brigadier General. During the battle, Lieutenant Zvika Greengold, who had arrived unattached to any unit, fought off attacks with his single tank until help arrived. \\"For the next 20 hours, Zvika Force, as he came to be known on the radio net, fought running battles with Syrian tanks‚Äîsometimes alone, sometimes as part of a larger unit, changing tanks half a dozen times as they were knocked out. He was wounded and burned but stayed in action and repeatedly showed up at critical moments from an unexpected direction to change the course of a skirmish.\\"\\"Shattered Heights: Part 1 ,\\" Jerusalem Post, September 25, 1998 (accessed June 9, 2005). After the war, the task of rebuilding the brigade was assigned to Yonatan Netanyahu. In the 1982 Lebanon War, it fought in Beirut and participated in the capture of the local airport.

The first to be scientifically classified, Fuchsia triphylla, was discovered on the Caribbean island of Hispaniola (Haiti and the Dominican Republic). The genus Fuchsia was discovered during the years 1696‚Äì1697 by the French Minim monk and botanist, Charles Plumier, during his third expedition to the Greater Antilles. He named the new genus after German botanist Leonhart Fuchs (1501‚Äì1566).Charles Plumier. Nova Plantarum Americanum Genera, Paris, 1703. Taxonomy Scientifically, fuchsias are most closely related to the northern hemisphere genus Circaea. It is hypothesized that the two lineages diverged around 41 million years ago.  Description  Fuchsia sp. in Japan Almost 110 species of Fuchsia are recognized. The vast majority of fuchsia species are native to South America, but a few occur north through Central America to Mexico. Several species can also be found from New Zealand to Tahiti. One species, F. magellanica, extends as far as the southern tip of South America, but the majority are tropical or subtropical. Most fuchsias are shrubs from tall. One New Zealand species, the k≈çtukutuku (F. excorticata), is classified as a tree that grows up to tall. Fuchsia leaves are found in whorls of three to five and usually have serrated margins. They range from 1‚Äì25 cm long, and can be either deciduous or evergreen, depending on the species. The flowers are very decorative; they have a pendulous teardrop shape and are displayed in profusion throughout the summer and autumn. The flowers are displayed all year in tropical species. They have four long, slender sepals and four shorter, broader petals. In many species, the sepals are bright red and the petals purple. Fuchsia colors can vary from white to dark red, purple- blue, and orange. Some have yellowish tones. The ovary is inferior and the fruit is a small (5‚Äì25 mm) dark reddish green, deep red, or deep purple berry. Fuchsias are known to contain numerous small seeds. The fruit of the berry of F. splendens is reportedly among the best-tasting. Its flavor is reminiscent of citrus and black pepper, and it can be made into jam. The fruits of some other fuchsias are flavorless or leave a bad aftertaste.  Species  Fuchsia hybrida The majority of Fuchsia species are native to Central and South America. A small additional number are found on Hispaniola (two species), in New Zealand (three species) and on Tahiti (one species). According to A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia, Philip A. Munz classified the genus into seven sections of 100 species. More recent scientific publications recognize 108 species and 122 taxa, organized into 12 sections. In New Zealand and Tahiti, section Skinnera now consists of only three species as F. √ó colensoi has been determined to be a naturally occurring hybrid between F. excorticata and F. perscandens. Also, F. procumbens has been placed into its own section, Procumbentes. Two other new sections are Pachyrrhiza and Verrucosa, each with one species. The Plant List, a cooperative endeavor by several leading botanical institutions to maintain a working list of all plant species, lists most currently accepted Fuchsia species and synonyms. The vast majority of garden hybrids have descended from a few parent species. = Ellobium = Mexico and Costa Rica. This section contains three species. * Fuchsia decidua * Fuchsia fulgens * Fuchsia splendens ** F. splendens var. splendens ** F. splendens var. cordifolia = Encliandra = Mexico to Panama.

The British Fuchsia Society maintains a list of hardy fuchsias that have been proven to survive a number of winters throughout Britain. Enthusiasts report that hundreds, even thousands of hybrids survive and prosper throughout Britain. In the United States, the Northwest Fuchsia Society maintains an extensive list of fuchsias that have proven hardy in members' gardens. Fuchsias from sections Quelusia (F. magellanica, F. regia), Encliandra, Skinnera (F. excorticata, F. perscandens) and Procumbentes (F. procumbens) have especially proven to be hardy in widespread areas of Britain and Ireland, as well as in many other countries such as New Zealand and the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. A number of species will easily survive outdoors in mild temperate areas. During the average British summer, some fuchsias will not flower. However, they often perform well in other favorable climatic zones. Even in somewhat colder regions, a number of the hardier species will often survive as herbaceous perennials, dying back and reshooting from below ground in the spring. Due to the temperate climate created by the North Atlantic current, fuchsias grow abundantly in the West Kerry region of Ireland. They also populate the Isles of Scilly. While F. magellanica is not widespread in Scotland, it has been known to grow wild in sheltered areas. In the Pacific Northwest region of the United States, F. magellanica easily survives regional winters. = Categories = Horticultural fuchsias may be categorized as upright and bushy, or trailing. Some can be manipulated into hedges, such as F. magellanica. Faster-growing varieties are easiest to manipulate. Care should be taken to choose the hardier cultivars for permanent plantings in the garden. Many popular upright Fuchsias such as 'Ernie', 'Jollies Nantes' and 'Maria Landy' are extremely tender (hardiness zone 10).  Cultivars  'Alice Hoffman' In the UK, 60 cultivated varieties of fuchsia have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, including:- * 'Alice Hoffman' (pink sepals, white petals ‚Äì hardy) * 'Display' (deep pink/rose pink single) * 'Dollar Prinzessin' (cerise sepals, purple petals ‚Äì hardy) * 'Garden News' (light pink sepals, double magenta petals ‚Äì hardy) * 'Genii' (single, cerise/purple) * 'Hawkshead' (white self) * 'Lady Thumb' (compact, pink sepals, white petals) * 'Mrs Popple' (vigorous, red sepals, purple petals ‚Äì hardy) * 'Riccartonii' (crimson sepals, purple petals) *'Snowcap' (scarlet sepals, white double petals) * 'Swingtime' (double, scarlet sepals, white petals) * 'Thalia' (tryphilla group, orange) * 'Tom Thumb' (compact, pink sepals, mauve petals)  Pests and diseases  Fuchsia with blossom opened Fuchsias are eaten by the caterpillars of some Lepidoptera, such as the elephant hawk-moth (Deilephila elpenor) and the black-lyre leafroller moth (\\"Cnephasia\\" jactatana). Other major insect pests include aphids, mirid bugs such as Lygocoris, Lygus and Plesiocoris spp., vine weevils (Otiorhynchus spp.), and greenhouse whitefly (Trialeurodes vaporariorum). Problematic mites include the fuchsia gall mite (Aculops fuchsiae) and red spider mite (Tetranychus urticae).  Pronunciation and spelling  While the original pronunciation from the word's German origin is \\"fook-sya\\" , the standard pronunciation for the common name in English is \\"fyu-sha\\" . As a consequence, fuchsia is often misspelled as ' in English. When pronounced as scientific Latin name, the pronunciation would be \\"fook- see-a\\", if one applies the rule that the root word in honorific Latin names should follow as much as possible the original pronunciation of the name of the person the plant is named for, plus the standard pronunciation of the Latin suffix. In practice, however, English-speaking botanists often pronounce it the same as the common name, \\"fyu-sha\\".  History  Leonhart Fuchs (1501‚Äì1566) Leonhart Fuchs, the namesake of the genus, was born in 1501. Fuchs was born in Wemding in the Duchy of Bavaria. He occupied the chair of Medicine at the University of T√ºbingen as a physician and professor. Fuchs occupied this role from his appointment at the age of 34 until his death in 1566. Aside from his interest in medicine, Fuchs enjoyed studying plants. During the 1500s, most remedies and medicines were herbal. In 1542, Fuchs wrote and published the seminal De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes. His work was praised for its rich illustrations. Along with Otto Brunfels (1489‚Äì1534) and Hieronymus Bock (1498‚Äì1554), Leonhart Fuchs is considered one of the three fathers of botany. In honour of Fuchs' work, the fuchsia received its name in the year 1702. Charles Plumier was responsible for naming the fuchsia. Plumier compiled his Nova Plantarum Americanum,nbased on the results of his third plant-finding trip to the Caribbean in search of new genera. Plumier published his research in Paris in 1703. Plumier's novel species was accepted by Carolus Linnaeus in 1753. The first fuchsia species were introduced into English gardens and glasshouses at the end of the 18th century. Fuchsia coccinea Aiton arrived at Kew Gardens in 1788. It was formally described in the year 1789. Fuchsia coccinea was apparently shortly followed by Fuchsia magellanica Lam. There is much early confusion between these two similar-looking species in the Quelusia Section as they seem to have hybridized readily as well. Fuchsia magellanica proved very hardy outdoors and its cultivars soon naturalized in favorable areas of the British Isles. Other species were quickly introduced to greenhouses.Fuchsia fulgens Mo√ß. & Sess√© ex DC was introduced in the 1830s. It resulted in an outpouring of new cultivars when crossed with the existing species. Philip Munz, in his A Revision of the Genus Fuchsia (1943), repeats the story that the fuchsia was first introduced into England by a sailor who grew it in a window. According to the story, it was observed by a nurseryman from Hammersmith, a Mr. Lee, who succeeded in buying it and propagating it for the trade. This was supposedly either one of the short-tubed species such as Fuchsia magellanica or Fuchsia coccinea. The story given by Munz first appears in the 1850s and is embellished in various early publications. Captain Firth, a sailor, brought the plant back to England from one of his trips to his home in Hammersmith where he gave it to his wife. Later James Lee of St. Johns Wood, nurseryman and an astute businessman, heard of the plant and purchased it for ¬£80. He then propagated as many as possible and sold them to the trade for prices ranging from ¬£10 to ¬£20 each. In the Floricultural Cabinet, 1855, there is a report which varies slightly from the above. There it is stated that F. coccinea was given to Kew Garden in 1788 by Captain Firth and that Lee acquired it from Kew. Other than a citation that Fuchsia coccinea was indeed given to Kew Garden by a Captain Firth, there is no firm evidence to support any of these claims. Throughout the nineteenth century, plant-collecting fever spread throughout Europe and the United States. Many species of numerous genera were introduced. Some plants were introduced as living plants, while others were introduced as seed. The following fuchsias were recorded in England at Kew: F. lycioides, 1796; F. arborescens, 1824; F. microphylla, 1827; F. fulgens, 1830; F. corymbiflora, 1840; and F. apetala, F. decussata, F. dependens and F. serratifolia in 1843 and 1844, the last four species attributable to Messrs. Veitch of Exeter. With the increasing numbers of differing species in England, plant breeders began to immediately develop hybrids to develop more desirable garden plants. The first recorded experiments date to 1825 as F. arborescens Œß F. macrostemma and F. arborescens X F. coccinea where the quality of the resultant plants was unrecorded. Between 1835 and 1850 there was a tremendous influx to England of both hybrids and varieties, the majority of which have been lost. In 1848 Felix Porcher published the second edition of his book Le Fuchsia son Histoire et sa Culture. This described 520 species. In 1871, James Lye became famous breeding fuchsias in England. In 1883, the first book of English fuchsias was published. Between 1900 and 1914, many famous varieties of fuchsias were grown extensively for Covent Garden. During the period between the first and second world wars, fuchsia-growing slowed as efforts were made toward crop production. After 1949, when plant and hybrid production resumed on a large scale. Sidney Mitchell, a member of the newly formed American Fuchsia Society, shipped a large collection of fuchsias back to California in 1930. A thorough census and collection of fuchsias already growing in California had been undertaken under the scientific leadership of Alice Eastwood. The census yielded ninety-one existing cultivars. Armed with that list, Mitchell acquired fifty-one new fuchsias. Forty-eight of his plants survived the long trip. The surviving plants were doled out to members of the society and local businesses. Half of the plants were cultivated at the University of California Botanical Garden in Berkeley. The other half of the plants were cultivated at the Berkeley Horticultural Nursery. This spiked a wave of interest in fuchsia breeding. Many famous American hybrids of the Forties and Fifties are the descendants of this 1930 group.

On May 20, 1948, the Israeli Carmeli Brigade captured al-Kabri (), a Palestinian Arab village in the northwest corner of the region of the British Mandate of Palestine that was later incorporated into the State of Israel. On March 27, 1948, hundreds of armed villagers and units of the Arab Liberation Army attacked a Jewish convoy near the village, killing forty-nine Jews. Six Arabs were also killed in the battle. Two months later the commander of Operation Ben-Ami gave operational orders given that day were to \\"attack with the aim of capturing, the villages of Kabri, Umm al Faraj and Al-Nahr, to kill the men [and] to destroy and set fire to the villages.\\"Benvenisti, 2000, pp. 138-139Morris, 2004, pp. 253, 347 Benvenisti states that \\"the orders were carried out to the letter\\", while Morris writes that a number of villagers were apparently executed.Morris, 2004, p. 254 Al-Kabri was captured without any resistance and it was almost immediately depopulated. It was treated particularly harshly due to the villagers involvement with the destruction of the Jewish convoy. According to Walid Khalidi, an 'undisclosed number of villagers were taken prisoner and some were killed' and others were killed during their dispersal in Galilee when it was discovered that they had come from al-Kabri.Khalidi, 1992, p. 21, quoting Nazzal, 1978. Published Accounts of the Incident According to a Palestinian publication, Dov Yirmiya, who was company commander in the 21st battalion, reported: :Kabri was conquered without a fight. Almost all inhabitants fled. One of the soldiers, Yehuda Reshef, who was together with his brother among the few rescapees from the Yehi'am convoy, got hold of a few youngsters who did not escape, probably seven, ordered them to fill up some ditches dug as an obstacle and then lined them up and fired at them with a machine gun. A few died but some of the wounded succeeded to escape. The battalion commander did not react. Reshef was a brave fighter and as a rescapee from the Yehi'am convoy, enjoyed special status in the battalion. He advanced later to the grade of Brigadier General. He justified his action as an act of revenge.The Palestinian Nabka: Register of Depopulated Localities in Palestine, compiled by SH Abu-Sitta The Palestinian Return Centre: London, September 2000 page 18 Aminah Muhammad Musa, a female refugee from al-Kabri, reported: :My husband and I left Kabri the day before it fell...

Thomas J. Hagerty, a founder of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905. Thomas Joseph Hagerty (ca. 1862‚Äì1920s?) was an American Roman Catholic priest and trade union activist. Hagerty is remembered as one of the founding members of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), as author of the influential Preamble to the Constitution of the IWW, and as the creator of \\"Hagerty's Wheel\\", a frequently reproduced illustration depicting the interrelation of the IWW's constituent industrial unions. Hagerty abruptly abandoned the radical movement shortly after the formation of the IWW, adopting the pseudonym \\"Ricardo Moreno\\" and working as a Spanish teacher and an oculist. After 1920 Hagerty lived on the streets of Chicago in conditions of dire poverty, eking out a meager existence as a beggar. Biography =Activist priest= Little is known about the early years of Thomas Joseph Hagerty, prior to his completion of seminary training in 1895.Gary M. Fink (ed.), \\" Thomas J. Hagerty,\\" in Biographical Dictionary of American Labor. Second edition. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 1983; pp. 272-273. He is believed to have become a Marxist about 1892 and to have spent his early life attempting to rectify the teachings of the church and the socialist movement throughout his early life. Hagerty's first posting was to St. Agatha's Parish in Chicago in 1895, where he served as assistant to the rector. He was assigned to St. Joseph's Church in Cleburne, Texas in the Diocese of Dallas in 1897 before being promoted to rector of Our Lady of Victory Church in Paris, Texas in 1901. He was transferred to Our Lady of Sorrows Church in Las Vegas, New Mexico later that same year. As a Catholic priest in the Southwestern United States Hagerty came into frequent contact with Mexican railroad workers, the mistreatment of whom by their employers angered him. Finding little socialist propaganda to be available in Spanish, Hagerty began translating a number of short works from German, French, and English. Hagerty was warned by the railroads to stay out of labor relations, he told a messenger \\"Tell the people who sent you here that I have a brace of Colts and can hit a dime at twenty paces.\\"Robert E. Doherty, \\"Thomas J. Hagerty, the Church, and Socialism.\\" Labor History, vol. 3, no. 1 (Winter 1962), pp. 39-56. Upon arriving in New Mexico in 1901, Hagerty became associated with the American Labor Union (ALU) and the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). During the summer of 1902, Hagerty went on a tour of mining camps in Colorado with Socialist Party of America (SPA) orator Eugene V. Debs, attempting to recruit the impoverished miners to the ALU and the SPA. This blatantly political activity brought Hagerty into conflict with his superiors, resulting in his suspension by his archbishop.Joyce Kornbluh, \\"One Big Union: The Philosophy of Industrial Unionism,\\" The Lucy Parsons Project, www.lucyparsonsproject.org/ Despite this fall from grace with the church hierarchy, Hagerty continued to consider himself a priest in good standing, writing in International Socialist Review that > \\"While it is true that I have withdrawn from the technical work of the > ministry, the withdrawal implies no derogation of my sacerdotal character. I > am as much a priest today as I ever was. I have not separated myself from > the communion of the Catholic Church; and I hold myself as much a member > thereof as the Pope himself.Thomas J. Hagerty, \\"A Correction,\\" International > Socialist Review [Chicago], vol. 3, no. 4 (October 1902), pp. 229-230. Hagerty remained defiant of his superiors, declaring that \\"bishops and priests exceed their authority when they use the influence of their position to oppose a movement whose highest purpose is the industrial liberation of the wage slaves of the world.\\" Catholics were \\"not bound to pay any attention to them in such matters,\\" Hagerty asserted, adding that the papal encyclicals of Pope Leo XIII against Socialism \\"have no more authority than that which attaches to the opinions of any private theologian.\\" One chapter of Hagerty's life was at an end. Another was beginning. =Industrial union activist= Cover of Hagerty's pamphlet Economic Discontent and Its Remedy, published by Eugene and Theodore Debs in 1902. Hagerty was employed as a touring organizer for the Socialist Party in 1903, traveling the breadth of the United States to deliver lectures on behalf of the party. Hagerty proved of value to the Socialists for his ability to appeal to Catholic workers on the basis of the social gospel, standing in contrast to the conservative church establishment, which remained staunchly and outspokenly anti-socialist. Hagerty proved to be a skillful orator and authored several pamphlets as a written adjunct to his activities as a party lecturer. Hagerty attempted to instill the idea that radical political ideas and traditional theological conceptions were fully independent. In his pamphlet Economic Discontent and Its Remedy, Hagerty wrote: > \\"As a matter of fact, Socialism has no more to do with religion than > astronomy or biology. Socialism is an economic science, not a system of > dogmatic beliefs. It is as much beyond the scope of Socialism to deal with > Divine revelation as it is beyond the range of the Republican Party to > advance a new exegesis of the Davidic Psalms. > > \\"If there are atheists and infidels in the Socialist Party, it is not the > fault of Socialism.

Hagerty, Economic Discontent and Its Remedy. Terre Haute, > IN: Standard Publishing Co., 1902; pg. 44. Hagerty was further radicalized during 1903 and 1904, a period marked by particular violence among the mining communities of the American west. Hagerty emerged as a leading critic of electorally-oriented socialist gradualists, who sought slow evolution towards the ultimate socialist goal by means of \\"boring from within\\" the established craft unions of the American Federation of Labor. Hagerty was not long in moving outside of the Socialist Party's orbit altogether, changing the focus of his efforts to the construction of new radical industrial unions. In 1904 Hagerty took a position as editor of a short-lived monthly publication of the American Labor Union called Voice of Labor, through which he gave voice to his ideas about organization of workers in industry. It was in this capacity as a leading union magazine editor of the day that Hagerty was invited early in January 1905 as one of 23 industrial union activists from 9 organizations to a secret Chicago conference for the planning of a new national union.Paul Frederick Brissenden, The IWW: A Study of American Syndicalism. Studies in History, Economics and Public Law vol 83, whole no. 193. New York: Columbia University, 1919; pp. 61-62. Hagerty help to draft the gathering's \\"Industrial Union Manifesto,\\" a document which was to serve as an intellectual foundation stone for the establishment of the Industrial Workers of the World at a convention later that same year. At the founding convention Hagerty served as secretary of the Constitution Committee, and as such wrote the preamble to the IWW Constitution ‚Äî a short and effective manifesto which became a fundamental element of the organization's official doctrine for decades to follow. Hagerty favored direct action, as opposed to political action of the Socialist Party and its left wing rival, the Socialist Labor Party, referring to them as \\"slowcialists.\\" Emphasizing this point during a speech to the founding convention of the IWW, Hagerty declared: > \\"The Ballot Box is simply a capitalist concession. Dropping pieces of paper > into a hole in a box never did achieve emancipation of the working class, > and in my opinion it never will.\\"Quoted in Melvyn Dubofsky, We Shall Be All: > A History of the Industrial Workers of the World.

Hagerty also produced a circular graphic commonly known as \\"Hagerty's Wheel\\", which depicted the various industrial unions comprising the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) organization as interrelated spokes. The diagram was around the clock divided into eight departments: Manufacture, Public Service, Distribution, Food Stuffs, Agriculture, Mining, Transportation, and Building, and in the centre a Central Administration. The diagram pretend to encompass \\"every imaginable type of economic activity and form of employment.\\"Melvyn Dubofsky. Big Bill Haywood, 1987, p. 34.

Syndicalism and the Transition to Communism p. 119 =Later years= Shortly after the formation of the IWW in 1905, Thomas Hagerty suddenly dropped out of the radical union movement.Roland Boer, \\"Father Thomas J. Hagerty: A Forgotten Religious Communist,\\" Monthly Review Zine, monthlyreview.org/ February 14, 2011. Hagerty severed his connections with both the church and the IWW, adopted the pseudonym \\"Ricardo Moreno\\" and henceforth earned his living as a teacher of Spanish and an oculist. From 1920 until the time of his death Hagerty-Moreno lived as a derelict on the streets of Chicago's skid row. The few of his old comrades who located Hagerty in Chicago found him, in the words of Roland Boer, \\"living in deep poverty, eventually reliant on soup kitchens, a few cents from passers-by, missions for a bed, and free concerts to keep up his cultural interests.\\" Hagerty-Moreno's death passed unremarked, probably sometime in the 1920s.

He was the first Liberal Democrat politician to win a parliamentary election, following the formation of the party through the merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP. He was also the most recent UK Member of Parliament to successfully take a seat from an opposing party following the assassination of the incumbent politician. Early life Bellotti attended Exeter School and then went on to complete diplomas in youth service and counselling. He studied part-time at the University of Sussex, gaining a MA in education policy. Political career Bellotti first contested the Eastbourne seat at the 1979 general election, subsequently fighting Lewes in the 1983 and 1987 general elections under the Liberal banner. He then won the parliamentary seat of Eastbourne for the Liberal Democrats in the 1990 by-election following the assassination of Conservative MP Ian Gow by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA). He became the first person to be elected as a Liberal Democrat MP after the party was formed in 1988 by a merger of the Liberal Party and the SDP. Bellotti's win was both unexpected and controversial, with Conservative MP Ann Widdecombe noting: \\"Bellotti is the innocent beneficiary of murder. I suspect as last night as the Liberal Democrats were toasting their success, in its hideouts the IRA were doing the same thing\\".The Guardian, 20 October 1990 After Bellotti's win, future by-elections resulting from assassinations of MPs saw most parties decline to contest the seat. The shock defeat contributed to the end of Margaret Thatcher's premiership in November 1990 as Conservative MPs worried if they could hold their seats at a general election if she remained prime minister. Two years later Bellotti was defeated by Nigel Waterson in the 1992 general election in which John Major's Conservative government was re-elected. He subsequently unsuccessfully contested the East Sussex and Kent South constituency in the 1994 elections to the European Parliament. Bellotti returned to local government, regaining a seat on East Sussex County Council and was elected chairman of Sussex Police Authority. He then became CEO of Brighton & Hove Albion, a position in which he controversially took part in the sale of the indebted football club's stadium after their articles of association had been changed, allowing for profit to be made on the sale of the Goldstone Ground. This change was however reversed on the insistence of the Football Association, preventing directors from taking out more than they had invested. Bellotti became reviled by Brighton fans and left the area shortly afterwards. After leaving the football club and losing his council seat Bellotti moved to Bath and became election agent for Don Foster MP. In May 2003 David Bellotti was elected councillor for Lyncombe ward on Bath and North East Somerset council and was re-elected in 2007 and 2011. He was appointed as chairman of the council for 2008/9 and was the council's cabinet member for resources for four years. He died on 10 June 2015, aged 71. Personal life Bellotti married three times. His first wife was Shelia Jones, whom he married in 1965. and they had a son and a daughter. He then married Jennifer Compson in 1973, with the couple having a son. His third wife was Jo Brown whom he married in 1996, and with whom he had a son and daughter.

Hula (Hule, Hebrew: ◊ó◊ï◊ú◊ê) is a village in Lebanon 3 km west of Kibbutz Manara, not far from the Litani River. It was captured on October 24 by the Carmeli Brigade of the Israel Defense Forces without any resistance. The women and children were expelled, most of the men aged between 15 and 60 were shot. In total between 35 and 58 men were executed in a house which was later blown up on top of them. Tveit, Odd Karsten (2010) Goodbye Lebanon. Israel's First Defeat. Rimal Publication. Translated by Peter Scott-Hansen. . p.368. Quoting General Dov Yermiya. Two officers were responsible for the massacre. One of them, first lieutenant Shmuel Lahis, who served as Company Commander, put on trial in an Israeli military court where he was given a seven-year sentence later reduced on appeal to one year, and was released in 1950. He received a retrospective presidential amnesty in 1955. He became a lawyer, and later Director General of the Jewish Agency. Many Israelis opposed to this appointing because of his involvement in the Hula massacre. (Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. VII, no. 4 (summer 1978), no. 28, pp. 143) At his trial, Lahis put forth the defence that the crime had been committed outside the borders of Israel. The military court rejected this defence but gave Lahis a postponement so that he could appeal this point to the High Court of Justice. In the same HCJ case, the Israeli government argued that the HCJ did not have the right to interpret military law. In February 1949, the HCJ rejected both the claim of Lahis and the claim of the government, allowing the trial to continue.Verdict from The Israeli High Court of Justice, Feb. 2, 1949; the written judgement was not provided until 1959: Shmuel Lahisse versus The Minister of Defense and others, HCJ 27/48.  Eye witness account  Deaths from 1948 Houla Massacre At the time of Lahis' nomination to head the Jewish Agency, Lahis's immediate superior in the Carmeli Brigade, Dov Yermiya, wrote to Jewish Agency Chairman Arie Dulzin about Lahis' role in the 1948 massacre. After Lahis' appointment in the role, the controversy was reported in the Israeli media and caused debate in the Knesset. Yermiya's letter was later published in the newspaper Al Hamishmar. :\\"I received a report that there had been no resistance in the village, that there was no enemy activity in the area, and that about a hundred people were left in the village. They had surrendered and requested to stay. The men among them were kept in one house under guard. I was brought there and saw about 35 men. [Yermiya does not remember the exact number today, and there were in fact over 50 men there] in the age range 15-60, including one Lebanese soldier in uniform [who was not killed].... When I returned to the village the following morning with an order to send the villagers away, I found out that, while I was away, two of the troops' officers had killed all of the captives who were in the house with a sub-machine gun, and had then blown up the house on top of them to be their grave. The women and children were sent west.\\" :\\"When I asked him why he had done this, the officer answered that this was 'his revenge for the murder of his best friends in the Haifa Oil Refinery massacre.'\\" (Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. VII, no. 4 (summer 1978), no. 28, pp. 143-145) After the Dulzin found out Lahis's actions he detained him and reported the crime to the brigade and sent a new officer to command the company.(Journal of Palestine Studies, vol. VII, no. 4 (summer 1978), no. 28, pp. 144) Dulzin's response to Yermiya's letter said that Lahis' past had been known to the Jewish Agency since 1961. It also revealed that when Lahis had applied to be registered as a lawyer in 1955 the matter had been examined by the Israeli Legal Council. It was decided that the act which was the reason for Lahis' trial at the military courts was \\"not an act that carries with it a stigma\\" (quoted by Dulzin, as translated by JPS).

He performed swing, dance music, and boogie-woogie songs, many of them written by Don Raye. Career Born in Newton, New Jersey, Bradley was raised in Washington, New Jersey. In 1928, he moved to New York City and became a member of bands such as Red Nichols & His Five Pennies. During the 1930s, he was a studio musician for CBS except for one year with the Ray Noble orchestra. In 1939 he started a big band with Ray McKinley, a swing drummer and vocalist from Texas, and changed his name from Schwictenberg to Will Bradley. The band included Freddie Slack, Arthur Rollini, Peanuts Hucko, Lee Castle, and Pete Candoli. Vocalists included Terry Allen, Carlotta Dale, Lynn Gardner, Steve Jordan, Ray McKinley, Phyllis Myles, Larry Southern, and Jimmy Valentine. The Bradley band became well known for boogie-woogie, particularly its hit record, \\"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\\". The song reached the top ten of Billboard magazine's popular music chart, as did \\"Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat\\" and \\"Down the Road a Piece\\". The latter song was recorded by the Will Bradley Trio, consisting of McKinley, Slack, and Doc Goldberg, with guest vocals by songwriter Don Raye. In 1942, McKinley departed to form his own band. Bradley hired trumpeter Shorty Rogers and drummer Shelly Manne, but many members wound up in the military due to the draft, and the band dissolved. For the rest of his music career, Bradley composed chamber music and orchestral works.

He served as a Teachta D√°la (TD) from 1921 to 1927. He was a Member of Parliament (MP) for Queen's County from 1918 to 1921. He was part of early nationalist Sinn F√©in, before going on to become a prominent member of Cumann na nGaedheal. In his capacity as Minister for Justice, O'Higgins established the Garda S√≠och√°na police force. His brother Thomas and nephews Tom and Michael were also elected TDs at various stages. Along with Arthur Griffith, Michael Collins and Eoin O'Duffy, O'Higgins is an important figure in Irish nationalist historiography, representing a more \\"conservative revolutionary\\" position when contrasted with republicanism. After having a role in the Irish War of Independence, he went on to defend the nascent Irish Free State, as part of the pro-Treaty side in the Irish Civil War. During this time he signed the execution orders of seventy-seven political prisoners. He was later assassinated in retaliation by an IRA unit in Booterstown, County Dublin. Background Kevin O'Higgins was born in Stradbally, County Laois, one of sixteen children of Dr. Thomas Higgins and Anne Sullivan, daughter of the Nationalist politician Timothy Daniel Sullivan.De Vere White, Terence Kevin O'Higgins Methuen and Co. London, 1948. His aunt was married to the Nationalist MP Tim Healy. He was educated at the Jesuit-run Clongowes Wood College, where he was expelled. O'Higgins was then moved to Knockbeg College, St. Marys Christian Brother School, Portlaoise. With a view to becoming a priest he went to St Patrick's College, Maynooth. There he broke the non- smoking rules, and was removed to Carlow Seminary.David Harkness, 'O'Higgins, Kevin Christopher (1892‚Äì1927)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2011. He attended University College Dublin. O'Higgins joined the Irish Volunteers in 1915. He was efficient, had a forceful personality and was soon appointed captain of Stradbally company, Carlow brigade. He joined Sinn F√©in, but was soon arrested and imprisoned in 1918. While he was in prison he became MP for Queen's County (Laois). 1919‚Äì1923 O'Higgins in 1922 In 1919, the First D√°il elected its \\"Aireacht\\" (Ministry) under the shadow of the Irish War of Independence. O'Higgins was appointed as the Assistant Minister for Local Government under W. T. Cosgrave. When Cosgrave was arrested in 1920, O'Higgins took the lead as head of the Ministry. Like other writers on Sinn F√©in, O'Higgins believed the extremists were self-deluded; they themselves rejected the damning epithet \\"extremist\\". When he wrote on disillusionment he articulated this fear: Sinn F√©in then split in 1922 over the terms of the Anglo-Irish Treaty. In the debate that took place in the D√°il on the Treaty, O'Higgins outlined the reasons for his support thus: When running for election in 1922, he told a crowd: He was duly elected Teachta D√°la (TD) for Leix‚ÄìOffaly, becoming Minister for Justice and External Affairs in the Provisional Government. When the Irish Civil War broke out in June 1922, O'Higgins tried to restore law and order by introducing tough measures. Between then and mid-1923, he confirmed the sentences of execution of seventy-seven republican prisoners of war, including Rory O'Connor who had been best man at his wedding. O'Higgins and his colleagues did not view them as prisoners of war, but rather as criminals. In reprisal for O'Higgins' role in the executions of captured republicans, the Anti-Treaty IRA murdered his father and burned his family home in Stradbally, County Laois. O'Higgins feared, as did many of his colleagues, that a prolonged civil conflict would give the British an excuse, in the eyes of the world, to reassert their control in the Free State. He was given a nominal posting to the Irish Army during the early stages of the war, which he described as \\"very short, though very brilliant\\". General Richard Mulcahy was less impressed, recalling that \\"O'Higgins' personal presence in the Adjutant- General's office at that time (July‚ÄìAugust 1922) was the personal presence of a person who didn't understand what was going on\\". In August 1922, following Collins' assassination, O'Higgins was moved from the Army to Ministry of Home Affairs. O'Higgins had formed a negative view of Cosgrave, having worked under him at Local Government, and was not happy when the latter was appointed President of the Executive Council. Of the alternatives Mulcahy had been seen as indecisive, pedantic and too close to the Army (opinions which the subsequent Kenmare incident would make widespread), whereas O'Higgins himself was not avowedly republican. In the Government of the 3rd D√°il he would be classed, along with Desmond FitzGerald, as one of the ‚ÄúDonnybrook set\\" - out of step with the rest on issues such as Irish language, autarky and militarism. O'Higgins had set up the Garda S√≠och√°na, but by September 1922, the force was experiencing indiscipline in the ranks. He appointed Eoin O'Duffy as Garda Commissioner. At the time O'Duffy was a fine organiser and worked for the emergence of a respected and unarmed police force. O'Duffy insisted on a Catholic nationalist ethos to distinguish the Garda√≠ from their RIC predecessors.Fearghal McGarry, 'O'Duffy, Eoin (1890‚Äì1944)', Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, January 2011. He became increasingly authoritarian in later years, however, a fact that caused several high-profile arguments between himself and O'Higgins. Cosgrave appointed O'Higgins as Vice-President in December that year. Politics and later career In March 1924, midway through the 'Army Mutiny', Minister Joseph McGrath resigned from the cabinet and President Cosgrave took sick leave. O'Higgins, as de facto head of government, reversed Cosgrave's policy of appeasement and confronted the IRAO mutineers confounding their objectives. In June, the Ministers and Secretaries Act 1924 changed his title from Minister for Home Affairs to Minister for Justice. As Minister for External Affairs he successfully increased Ireland's autonomy within the Commonwealth of Nations. O'Higgins was seen very much as the \\"strong man\\" of the cabinet. He once described himself as one of \\"the most conservative-minded revolutionaries that ever put through a successful revolution\\". Though far- left political enemies characterised him as having supposed \\"fascist\\" tendencies, O'Higgins was to the fore in resisting the small wing of Cumann na nGaedheal who looked to Italy for inspiration.Mark Phelan, 'No Fascisti!' - Kevin O'Higgins and the defence of democratic policing in 1920s Ireland', Irish Times, 4 July 2017 He did not approve of feminism, for instance when asked by Leader of the Labour Party Thomas Johnson in the D√°il whether he believed giving women the vote had been a success, O'Higgins replied, He famously derided the socialist influenced Democratic Programme of the First D√°il as \\"mostly poetry\\". Before his death, he toyed with Arthur Griffith's idea of a dual monarchy to end the Partition of Ireland. Assassination On Sunday 10 July 1927, O'Higgins was assassinated at the age of 35 on the Booterstown Avenue side of Cross Avenue in Dublin, while on his way to Mass at the Church of the Assumption, Booterstown, by three anti-Treaty members of the IRA, Timothy Coughlan, Bill Gannon and Archie Doyle, in revenge for O'Higgins' part in the executions of 77 IRA prisoners during the civil war. None of the three assassins was ever apprehended or charged, but Coughlan, a member of Fianna F√°il as well as the IRA, was killed in strange circumstances in Dublin, in 1928, by a police undercover agent whom he was attempting to murder. The other two (Doyle and Gannon) benefited from the amnesty to IRA members issued by √âamon de Valera, upon his assumption of power in 1932. Gannon, who died in 1965, joined the Communist Party of Ireland and played a central role in organising Irish volunteers for the Spanish Civil War. Yet in party publications his part in assassinating O'Higgins is downplayed. Doyle remained a prominent IRA militant and took part in various acts in the early 1940s. He lived to an old age, dying in 1980, and continued to take pride in having killed O'Higgins. Legacy O'Higgins body lay in state in the Mansion House before a state funeral held at St Andrew's Church, Westland Row. He was buried at Glasnevin Cemetery.Lyng, Paul (2000). \\"Booterstown, A pastoral journey through four centuries 1616‚Äì2000\\", Future Print. In 1927, a relief of O'Higgins was posthumously added to a 1923 cenotaph in the grounds of Leinster House dedicated to Michael Collins and Arthur Griffith. This was replaced in 1950, by a simpler granite obelisk commemorating Griffith, Collins and O'Higgins. In July 2012, Taoiseach Enda Kenny unveiled a commemorative plaque to his memory at the site in Booterstown, at the junction of Cross Avenue and Booterstown Avenue, where he was shot. Red paint was sprayed over this memorial within its first week, and it was further damaged shortly afterwards. It was removed some two weeks later and has not returned. His brother Thomas F. O'Higgins and nephews Tom O'Higgins and Michael O'Higgins were later elected TDs. His granddaughter Iseult O'Malley is a judge of the Supreme Court of Ireland.

It referred to the western part of the Roman province of Gallia Narbonensis that passed to the control of the Visigoths in 462, when Septimania was ceded to their king, Theodoric II. Under the Visigoths it was known as simply Gallia or Narbonensis. Septimania territory roughly corresponds with the modern French former administrative region of Languedoc- Roussillon that merged into the new administrative region of Occitanie. Septimania was conquered by the Muslims and was part of the Al-Andalus. It passed briefly to the Emirate of C√≥rdoba, which had been expanding from the south during the eighth century before its subsequent conquest by the Franks, who by the end of the ninth century termed it Gothia or the Gothic March (Marca Gothica). Septimania became a march of the Carolingian Empire and then West Francia down to the thirteenth century, though it was culturally and politically autonomous from the northern France-based central royal government. The region was under the influence of the people from the count territories of Toulouse, Provence, and ancient County of Barcelona. It was part of the wider cultural and linguistic region comprising the southern third of France known as Occitania. This area was finally brought under effective control of the French kings in the early 13th century as a result of the Albigensian Crusade after which it was assigned governors. From the end of the thirteenth century Septimania evolved into the royal province of Languedoc. The name \\"Septimania\\" may derive from part of the Roman name of the city of B√©ziers, Colonia Julia Septimanorum Beaterrae, which in turn alludes to the settlement of veterans of the Roman VII Legion in the city. Another possible derivation of the name is in reference to the seven cities (civitates) of the territory: B√©ziers, Elne, Agde, Narbonne, Lod√®ve, Maguelonne, and N√Æmes. Septimania extended to a line halfway between the Mediterranean and the Garonne River in the northwest; in the east the Rh√¥ne separated it from Provence; and to the south its boundary was formed by the Pyrenees. Visigothic Narbonensis =Gothic acquisition= Under Theodoric II, the Visigoths settled in Aquitaine as foederati of the Western Roman Empire (450s). Sidonius Apollinaris refers to Septimania as \\"theirs\\" during the reign of Avitus (455‚Äì456), but Sidonius is probably considering Visigothic settlement of and around Toulouse. The Visigoths were then holding the Toulousain against the legal claims of the Empire, though they had more than once offered to exchange it for the Auvergne. In 462, the Empire, controlled by Ricimer in the name of Libius Severus, granted the Visigoths the western half of the province of Gallia Narbonensis to settle. The Visigoths occupied Provence (eastern Narbonensis) as well and only in 475 did the Visigothic king, Euric, cede it to the Empire by a treaty whereby the emperor Julius Nepos recognised the Visigoths' full independence. =Kingdom of Narbonne= The Visigoths, perhaps because they were Arians, met with the opposition of the Catholic Franks in Gaul. The Franks allied with the Armorici, whose land was under constant threat from the Goths south of the Loire, and in 507 Clovis I, the Frankish king, invaded the Visigothic kingdom, whose capital lay in Toulouse, with the consent of the leading men of the tribe. Clovis defeated the Goths in the Battle of Vouill√© and the child-king Amalaric was carried for safety into Iberia while Gesalec was elected to replace him and rule from Narbonne. Clovis, his son Theuderic I, and his Burgundian allies proceeded to conquer most of Visigothic Gaul, including the Rouergue (507) and Toulouse (508). The attempt to take Carcassonne, a fortified site guarding the Septimanian coast, was defeated by the Ostrogoths (508) and Septimania thereafter remained in Visigothic hands, though the Burgundians managed to hold Narbonne for a time and drive Gesalec into exile. Border warfare between Gallo-Roman magnates, including bishops, had existed with the Visigoths during the last phase of the Empire and it continued under the Franks. The Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great reconquered Narbonne from the Burgundians and retained it as the provincial capital. Theudis was appointed regent at Narbonne by Theodoric while Amalaric was still a minor in Iberia. When Theodoric died in 526, Amalaric was elected king in his own right and he immediately made his capital in Narbonne. He ceded Provence, which had at some point passed back into Visigothic control, to the Ostrogothic king Athalaric. The Frankish king of Paris, Childebert I, invaded Septimania in 531 and chased Amalaric to Barcelona in response to pleas from his sister, Chrotilda, that her husband, Amalaric, had been mistreating her. The Franks however, did not try to hold the province and under Amalaric's successor, the centre of gravity of the kingdom crossed the Pyrenees and Theudis made his capital in Barcelona. =Gothic province of Gallia= In the Visigothic kingdom, which became centred on Toledo by the end of the reign of Leovigild, the province of Gallia Narbonensis, usually shortened to just Gallia or Narbonensis and never called Septimania, was both an administrative province of the central royal government and an ecclesiastical province whose metropolitan was the Archbishop of Narbonne. Originally, the Goths may have maintained their hold on the Albigeois, but if so it was conquered by the time of Chilperic I. There is archaeological evidence that some enclaves of Visigothic population remained in Frankish Gaul, near the Septimanian border, after 507. The province of Gallia held a unique place in the Visigothic kingdom, as it was the only province outside of Iberia, north of the Pyrenees, and bordering a strong foreign nation, in this case the Franks. The kings after Alaric II favoured Narbonne as a capital, but twice (611 and 531) were defeated and forced back to Barcelona by the Franks before Theudis moved the capital there permanently. Under Theodoric Septimania had been safe from Frankish assault, but was raided by Childebert I twice (531 and 541). When Liuva I succeeded to the throne in 568, Septimania was a dangerous frontier province and Iberia was wracked by revolts. Liuva granted Iberia to his son Leovigild and took Septimania to himself. During the revolt of Hermenegild (583‚Äì585) against his father Leovigild, Septimania was invaded by Guntram, King of Burgundy, possible in support of Hermenegild's revolt, since the latter was married to his niece Ingundis. The Frankish attack of 585 was repulsed by Hermenegild's brother Reccared, who was ruling Narbonensis as a sub-king. Hermenegild died at Tarragona that year and it is possible that he had escaped confinement in Valencia and was seeking to join up with his Frankish allies. Alternatively, the invasion may have occurred in response to Hermenegild's death. Reccared meanwhile took Beaucaire (Ugernum) on the Rh√¥ne near Tarascon and Cabaret (a fort called Ram's Head), both of which lay in Guntram's kingdom. Guntram ignored two pleas for a peace in 586 and Reccared undertook the only Visigothic invasion of Francia in response. However, Guntram was not motivated solely by religious alliance with the fellow Catholic Hermenegild, for he invaded Septimania again in 589 and was roundly defeated near Carcassonne by Claudius, Duke of Lusitania. It is clear that the Franks, throughout the sixth century, had coveted Septimania, but were unable to take it and the invasion of 589 was the last attempt. In the seventh century, Gallia often had its own governors or duces (dukes), who were typically Visigoths. Most public offices were also held by Goths, far out of proportion to their part of the population. =Culture of Gothic Septimania= The native population of Gallia was referred to by Visigothic and Iberian writers as the \\"Gauls\\" and there is a well-attested hatred between the Goths and the Gauls which was atypical for the kingdom as a whole. The Gauls commonly insulted the Goths by comparing the strength of their men to that of Gaulish women, though the Spaniards regarded themselves as the defenders and protectors of the Gauls. It is only in the time of Wamba (reigned 672-680) and Julian of Toledo, however, that a large Jewish population becomes evident in Septimania: Julian referred to it as a \\"brothel of blaspheming Jews.\\" Thanks to the preserved canons of the Council of Narbonne of 590, a good deal can be known about surviving pagan practices in Visigothic Septimania. The Council may have been responding in part to the orders of the Third Council of Toledo, which found \\"the sacrilege of idolatry [to be] firmly implanted throughout almost the whole of Iberia and Septimania.\\" The Roman pagan practice of not working Thursdays in honour of Jupiter was still prevalent. The council set down penance to be done for not working on Thursday save for church festivals and commanded the practice of Martin of Braga, rest from rural work on Sundays, to be adopted. Also punished by the council were fortunetellers, who were publicly lashed and sold into slavery. Different theories exist concerning the nature of the frontier between Septimania and Frankish Gaul. On the one hand, cultural exchange is generally reputed to have been minimal, but the level of trading activity has been disputed. There have been few to no objects of Neustrian, Austrasian, or Burgundian provenance discovered in Septimania. However, a series of sarcophagi of a unique regional style, variously labelled Visigothic, Aquitainian, or south-west Gallic, are prevalent on both sides of the Septimania border. These sarcophagi are made of locally quarried marble from Saint-B√©at and are of varied design, but with generally flat relief which distinguishes them from Roman sarcophagi. Their production has been dated to either the 5th, 6th, or 7th century, with the second of these being considered the most likely today. However, if they were made in the 5th century, while both Aquitaine and Septimani were in Visigothic hands, their existence provides no evidence for a cultural osmosis across the Gothic-Frankish frontier. A unique style of orange pottery was common in the 4th and 5th centuries in southern Gaul, but the later (6th century) examples culled from Septimania are more orange than their cousins from Aquitaine and Provence and are not found commonly outside of Septimania, a strong indicator that there was little commerce over the frontier or at its ports. In fact, Septimania helped to isolate both Aquitaine and Iberia from the rest of the Mediterranean world. Coinage of the Visigothic kingdom of Hispania did not circulate in Gaul outside of Septimania and Frankish coinage did not circulate in the Visigothic kingdom, including Septimania. If there had been a significant amount of commerce over the frontier, the monies paid had to have been melted down immediately and re-minted as foreign coins have not been preserved across the frontier. Muslim Septimania The Arabs, under Al-Samh ibn Malik, the governor-general of al-Andalus, sweeping up the Iberian peninsula, by 719 overran Septimania; al-Samh set up his capital from 720 at Narbonne, which the Moors called \\"Arbuna\\", offering the still largely Arianist Christian inhabitants generous terms and quickly pacifying the other cities. Following the conquest, al-Andalus was divided into five administrative areas, roughly corresponding to present Andalusia, Galicia and Lusitania, Castile and L√©on, Aragon and Catalonia, and the ancient province of Septimania. With Narbonne secure, and equally important, its port, for the Arab mariners were masters now of the Western Mediterranean, al-Samh swiftly subdued the largely unresisting cities, still controlled by their Visigoth counts: taking Alet and B√©ziers, Agde, Lod√®ve, Maguelonne and N√Æmes. Military campaigns around the Pyrenees and Septimania By 721, he was reinforced and ready to lay siege to Toulouse, a possession that would open up bordering Aquitaine to him on the same terms as Septimania. But his plans were thwarted in the disastrous Battle of Toulouse (721), with immense losses, in which al-Samh was so seriously wounded that he soon died at Narbonne. Arab forces, soundly based in Narbonne and easily resupplied by sea, struck in the 720s, conquering Carcassonne on the north-western fringes of Septimania (725) and penetrating eastwards as far as Autun (725). In 731, the Berber lord of the region of Cerdagne Uthman ibn Naissa, called \\"Munuza\\" by the Franks, was an ally of the Duke of Aquitaine Odo the Great after he revolted against Cordova, but the rebel lord was defeated and killed by Abdul Rahman Al Ghafiqi, so opening Aquitaine to the Umayyads. After capturing Bordeaux on the wake of duke Hunald's detachment attempt, Charles Martel directed his attention to Septimania and Provence. While his reasons for leading a military expedition south remain unclear, it seems that he wanted to seal his newly secured grip on Burgundy, now threatened by Umayyad occupation of several cities lying in the lower Rhone, or maybe it provided the excuse he needed to intervene in this territory ruled by Gothic and Roman law, far off from the Frankish centre in the north of Gaul. In 737, the Frankish leader went on to attack Narbonne, but the city held firm, defended by its Goths and Jews under the command of its governor Yusuf, 'Abd er-Rahman's heir. Charles had to go back north without subduing Narbonne, leaving behind a trail of destroyed cities, i.e. Avignon, N√Æmes and other Septimanian fortresses. Septimania during Pepin¬¥s expedition (752-759) Around 747 the government of the Septimania region (and the Upper March, from Pyr√©n√©es to Ebro River) was given to Umar ibn Umar. In 752, Pippin headed south to Septimania. Gothic counts of N√Æmes, Melguelh, Agde and B√©ziers refused allegiance to the emir at Cordova and declared their loyalty to the Frankish king--the count of N√Æmes, Ansemund, having some authority over the remaining counts. The Gothic counts and the Franks then began to besiege Narbonne, where Mil√≥ was probably the count (as successor of the count Gilbert). However, the strongly Gothic Narbonne under Muslim rule resisted to the Carolingian thrust. Attacks on the rearguard by a Basque army under the Aquitanian duke Waifer did not make things easy for Pippin. In 754, an anti- Frankish reaction, led by Ermeniard, killed Ansemund, but the uprising was without success and Radulf was designated new count by the Frankish court. About 755 Abd ar-Rahman ibn Uqba replaced Umar ibn Umar. Narbonne capitulated in 759 only after Pippin promised the defenders of the city to uphold the Gothic law, and the county was granted to Mil√≥, the Gothic count in Muslim times, thus earning the loyalty of Septimania's Goths against Waifer. Islamic burials have been found in N√Æmes. Gothia in Carolingian times Gothia and Marca Hispanica The region of Roussillon was taken by the Franks in 760. Pepin then diverted northwest to Aquitaine, so triggering the war against Waifer of Aquitaine. Albi, Rouergue, G√©vaudan and the city of Toulouse were conquered. In 777, the wali of Barcelona, Sulayman al-Arabi, and the wali of Huesca Abu Taur, offered their submission to Charlemagne and also the submission of Husayn, wali of Zaragoza. When Charlemagne invaded the Upper March in 778, Husayn refused allegiance and he had to retire. In the Pyrenees, the Basques defeated his forces in Roncesvalles (August 15, 778). The Frankish king found Septimania and the borderlands so devastated and depopulated by warfare, with the inhabitants hiding among the mountains, that he made grants of land that were some of the earliest identifiable fiefs to Visigothic and other refugees. Charlemagne also founded several monasteries in Septimania, around which the people gathered for protection. Beyond Septimania to the south Charlemagne established the Spanish Marches in the borderlands of his empire. The territory passed to Louis, king in Aquitaine, but it was governed by Frankish margraves and then dukes (from 817) of Septimania. The Frankish noble Bernat of Septimania was the ruler of these lands from 826 to 832. His career (he was beheaded in 844) characterized the turbulent 9th century in Septimania. His appointment as Count of Barcelona in 826 occasioned a general uprising of the Catalan lords (Bellonids) at this intrusion of Frankish power over the lands of Gothia. For suppressing Berenguer of Toulouse and the Catalans, Louis the Pious rewarded Bernat with a series of counties, which roughly delimit 9th century Septimania: Narbonne, B√©ziers, Agde, Magalona, N√Æmes and Uz√©s. Rising against Charles the Bald in 843, Bernat was apprehended at Toulouse and beheaded. Bernat's son, known as Bernat of Gothia, also served as Count of Barcelona and Girona, and as Margrave of Gothia and Septimania from 865 to 878. Septimania became known as Gothia after the reign of Charlemagne. It retained these two names while it was ruled by the counts of Toulouse during early part of the Middle Ages, but other names became regionally more prominent such as, Roussillon, Conflent, Raz√®s or Foix, and the name Gothia (along with the older name Septimania) faded away during the 10th century, as the region fractured into smaller feudal entities, which sometimes retained Carolingian titles, but lost their Carolingian character, as the culture of Septimania evolved into the culture of Languedoc. This fragmentation in small feudal entities and the resulting fading and the gradual shifting of the name Gothia are the most probable origins of the ancient geographical area known as Gathalania or Cathalania which has reached our days as the present region of Catalonia. The name was used because the area was populated by a higher concentration of Goths than in surrounding regions. The rulers of this area, when joined with several counties, were titled the Marquesses of Gothia (and, also, the Dukes of Septimania).

Of Anglo-Irish descent, she was won over to Irish nationalism by the plight of evicted people in the Land Wars. She also actively agitated for Home Rule. She is well-known for being the muse and long-time love interest of Irish poet W. B. Yeats. Early life She was born at Tongham. near Farnham, Surrey, as Edith Maud Gonne, the eldest daughter of Captain Thomas Gonne (1835‚Äì86) of the 17th Lancers, whose ancestors hailed from Caithness in Scotland, and his wife, Edith Frith Gonne, born Cook (1844‚Äì71). After her mother died while Maud was still a child, her father sent her to a boarding school in France to be educated. \\"The Gonnes came from County Mayo, but my great-great grandfather was disinherited and sought fortune abroad trading in Spanish wine,\\" she wrote. \\"My grandfather was head of a prosperous firm with houses in London and Oporto ‚Äì he destined my father to take charge of the foreign business and had him educated abroad. My father spoke 6 languages but had little taste for business, so he got a commission in the English army; his gift for languages secured for him diplomatic appointments in Austria, the Balkans and Russia, and he was as much at home in Paris as in Dublin.\\" Early career In 1882 her father, an army officer, was posted to Dublin. She accompanied him and remained with him until his death. She returned to France after a bout of tuberculosis and fell in love with a right wing politician, Lucien Millevoye. They agreed to fight for Irish independence and to regain Alsace-Lorraine for France. She returned to Ireland and worked tirelessly for the release of Irish political prisoners from jail. In 1889, she first met W. B. Yeats, who fell in love with her. In 1890 she returned to France where she once again met Millevoye and had a son, Georges, with him. Georges died, possibly of meningitis, in 1891. Gonne was distraught, and buried him in a large memorial chapel built for him with money she had inherited. Her distress remained with her; in her will she asked for Georges's baby shoes to be interred with her, but made no mention of the daughter born a few years after him. In Dublin, London and Paris she was attracted to the occultist and spiritualist worlds deeply important to Yeats, asking his friends about the reality of reincarnation. In 1891 she briefly joined the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn, a magical organisation with which Yeats had involved himself.Lewis, p. 140 Gonne separated from Millevoye after Georges' death, but in late 1893 she arranged to meet him at the mausoleum in Samois-sur-Seine and, next to the coffin, they had sexual intercourse. Her purpose was to conceive a baby with the same father, to whom the soul of Georges would transmigrate in metempsychosis. In August 1894 Gonne and Millevoye's daughter Iseult was born. At age 23, Iseult was proposed to by William Butler Yeats, and she had a brief affair with Ezra Pound. At age 26, Iseult married the Irish-Australian novelist, Francis Stuart, who was then 18 years old. During the 1890s Gonne travelled extensively throughout England, Wales, Scotland and the United States campaigning for the nationalist cause, forming an organization called the \\"Irish League\\" (L'association irlandaise) in 1896. In 1899 her relationship with Millevoye ended. Gonne, in opposition to the attempts of the British to gain the loyalty of the young Irish during the early 1900s, was known to hold special receptions for children. She, along with other volunteers, fought to preserve the Irish culture during the period of British rule, founding Inghinidhe na h√âireann Twenty-nine women attended the first meeting. They decided to \\"combat in every way English influence doing so much injury to the artistic taste and refinement of the Irish people.\\". In her autobiography she wrote, \\"I have always hated war and am by nature and philosophy a pacifist, but it is the English who are forcing war on us, and the first principle of war is to kill the enemy.\\" Acting Gonne, 1890 to 1910 In 1897, along with Yeats and Arthur Griffith, she organised protests against Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee. In April 1902, she took a leading role in Yeats's play Cathleen N√≠ Houlihan. She portrayed Cathleen, the \\"old woman of Ireland\\", who mourns for her four provinces which had been \\"lost\\" to the British. She was already spending much of her time in Paris.McCoole, \\"No Ordinary Women\\", p.24 In the same year, she joined the Roman Catholic Church. She refused many marriage proposals from Yeats, not only because he was unwilling to convert to Catholicism and because she viewed him as insufficiently radical in his nationalism, but also because she believed his unrequited love for her had been a boon for his poetry and that the world should thank her for never having accepted his proposals. When Yeats told her he was not happy without her, she replied, In the 1930s she was involved in the Friends of Soviet Russia organisation. Marriage In Paris in 1903, after having turned down at least four marriage proposals from Yeats between 1891 and 1901, Maud married Major John MacBride, who had led the Irish Transvaal Brigade against the British in the Second Boer War. The following year their son Se√°n MacBride was born. Afterwards Gonne and her husband agreed to end their marriage. She demanded sole custody of their son, but MacBride refused, and a divorce case began in Paris on 28 February 1905. The only charge against MacBride substantiated in court was that he had been drunk on one occasion during the marriage. A divorce was not granted, and MacBride was given the right to visit his son twice weekly. After the marriage ended, Gonne made allegations of domestic violence and, according to W. B. Yeats, of sexual molestation of Iseult, her daughter from a previous relationship, then aged eleven.p. 286, Foster, R. F. (1997). W. B. Yeats: A Life, Vol. I: The Apprentice Mage. New York: Oxford UP. Critics have suggested that Yeats may have fabricated his allegations due to his hatred of MacBride over Maud's rejection of him in favour of MacBride. Neither the divorce papers submitted by Gonne nor Iseult's own writings mention any such incident, which is unsurprising, given the reticence of the times around such matters, but Francis Stuart, Iseult's later husband, attests to Iseult telling him about it. The allegation concerning Iseult was made by Maud to Dr. Anthony MacBride, John's brother. Though Maud omitted it from court proceedings, the MacBride side raised it in court to have John's name cleared. As Maud wrote to Yeats, MacBride succeeded in this. Yeats and some of his biographers have maintained that Iseult was a victim, and have omitted the court incident.The Yeats Gonne MacBride Triangle, Anthony J. Jordan. Westport Books, 2000. pp. 86‚Äì104 MacBride visited his son as allowed for a short time, but returned to Ireland and never saw him again. Gonne raised the boy in Paris. MacBride was executed in May 1916 along with James Connolly and other leaders of the Easter Rising. After MacBride's death Gonne felt that she could safely return to live permanently in Ireland. In 1917 Yeats, in his fifties, proposed first to Maud Gonne, who turned him down, and then to the 23-year-old Iseult, who did not accept either. He had known her since she was four, and often referred to her as his darling child and took a paternal interest in her writings (many Dubliners wrongly suspected that Yeats was her father). Iseult considered the proposal, but finally turned him down, because he was not really in love with her and it would upset her mother too much.Yeat's Ghosts, Brenda Maddox, ch. 3 Maud Gonne (far right) with relief agency members in Dublin in July 1922 =Women's movement= Gonne remained very active in Paris. In 1913, she established L'Irlande libre, a French newspaper. She wanted Cumann na mBan to be considered seriously: her idea was to get affiliation with the English Red Cross, and wrote to Geneva to gain an international profile for the new nationalist organization.McCoole, p. 30 cites Barry Delany, 'Cumann na mBan', William Fitzgerald (ed.) \\"The Voice of Ireland\\", London, Virtue & Co Ltd, p.162. In 1918, she was arrested in Dublin and imprisoned in England for six months. She worked with the Irish White Cross for the relief of victims of violence. Gonne MacBride moved in upper-class circles. Lord French's sister, Mrs Charlotte Despard was a famous suffragist, who was already a Sinn Feiner when she arrived in Dublin in 1920. She naturally accompanied Gonne on a tour of County Cork, seat of the most fervent revolutionary activity. Cork was under Martial Law Area (MLA) prohibited to Irishmen and women outside the zone. But the Viceroy's sister had a pass.Diary of Hanah Moynihan, KGC, Dublin, cited in McCoole, p. 80. In 1921, she opposed the Treaty and advocated the Republican side. The committee that set up White Cross in Ireland asked Gonne to join in January 1921 to distribute funds to victims administered by Cumann na mBan.Diary of Hannah Moynihan, Autograph Books, Kilmainham Gaol Collection, Dublin. She settled in Dublin in 1922. During the street battles she headed up a delegation called The Women's Peace Committee which approached the D√°il leadership, and her old friend Arthur Griffith. But they were unable to stop the indiscriminate shooting of civilians, being more interested in law and order. In August she set up a similar organization, the Women's Prisoner's Defence League. The prisons were brutal and many women were locked up in men's prisons. The League supported families wanting news of inmates. They worked for prisoners rights, began vigils, and published stories of tragic deaths. Through her friendship with Despard and opposition to government they were labeled \\"Mad and Madame Desperate\\".Margaret Mullvihill, \\"Charlotte Despard\\", pp. 143‚Äì45, cited by McCoole, p. 96. Historians have related the extent of the damage done to her home at 75 St Stephen's Green, when soldiers of the Free State Army ransacked the place. Maud was arrested and taken to Mountjoy Jail. On 9 November 1922 the Sinn F√©in Office was raided in Suffolk street; the Free State had swept the capital, rounding up opposition committing them to prison for internment. The evidence comes from Margaret Buckley, who as Secretary of Sinn F√©in acted as legal representative for the ladies. But there was nothing prudish about their concerted opposition to civil rights abuses. On 10 April 1923, Maud Gonne MacBride was arrested. The charges were: 1) painting banners for seditious demonstrations, and 2) preparing anti-government literature. According to the diary account of her colleague Hannah Moynihan: > Last night [10th April] at 11pm, we heard the commotion which usually > accompanies the arrival of new prisoners... we pestered the wardress and she > told us there were four ‚Äì Maud Gonne MacBride, her daughter Mrs Iseult > Stuart and two lesser lights... Early this morning... we could see Maud > walking majestically past our cell door leading on a leash a funny little > lap dog which answered to the name that sounded like Wuzzo - Wuzzo.Diary of > Hannah Moynihan, KGC, Dublin, as cited by McCoole, pp. 118‚Äì19. She was released on 28 April, after twenty days in custody. Months later the women spread a rumour that Nell Ryan had died in custody in order to gain a propaganda victory.Nellie O'Cleirigh, p. 12 Women continued to be arrested. On 1 June Maud was standing in protest outside Kilmainham Jail with Dorothy Macardle, the writer and activist, and Iseult Stuart. They were supporting hungerstriker Maire Comerford. Again the source for this story seems to be fellow ex-prisoner Hanna Moynihan.McCoole, p. 129. Yeats's muse Maud Gonne's gravestone, Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. May 2015 Many of Yeats's poems are inspired by her, or mention her, such as \\"This, This Rude Knocking.\\" He wrote the plays The Countess Cathleen and Cathleen ni Houlihan for her. His poem \\"Aedh wishes for the Cloths of Heaven\\" ends with a reference to her: > I have spread my dreams under your feet; > Tread softly because you tread on my dreams. Few poets have celebrated a woman's beauty to the extent Yeats did in his lyric verse about Gonne. From his second book to Last Poems, she became the Rose, Helen of Troy (in No second Troy), the Ledaean Body (\\"Leda and the Swan\\" and \\"Among School Children\\"), Cathleen N√≠ Houlihan, Pallas Athene and Deirdre. > Why should I blame her that she filled my days > With misery, or that she late > Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways > Or hurled the little streets upon the great. > (from 'No second Troy', 1916) Yeats's 1893 poem \\"On a Child's Death\\" is thought to have been inspired by the death of Gonne's son Georges, whom Yeats thought Gonne had adopted. The poem was not published in Yeats's lifetime; scholars say he did not want the poem to be part of his canon, as it is of uneven quality. Personal Maud Gonne MacBride published her autobiography in 1938, titled A Servant of the Queen, a reference to both a vision she had of the Irish queen of old, Kathleen Ni Houlihan and an ironic title considering Gonne's Irish Nationalism and rejection of the British monarchy. Her son, Se√°n MacBride, was active in politics in Ireland and in the United Nations. He was a founding member of Amnesty International and its Chairman, and he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1974. She died in Clonskeagh, aged 86, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin.

Life Jimmy O'Dea was born at 11 Lower Bridge Street, Dublin, to James O'Dea, an ironmonger, and Martha O'Gorman, who kept a small toy shop. He was one of 11 children. His father had a shop in Capel Street. He was educated at the Irish Christian Brothers O'Connell School in North Richmond Street, Dublin, where a classmate was future Taoiseach Se√°n Lemass, by the Holy Ghost Fathers at Blackrock College, and by the Jesuits at Belvedere College.The Irish Times, \\"Jimmy O'Dea dies after 40 years on the Irish stage\\", 8 January 1965 From a young age he was interested in taking to the stage; he co-founded an amateur acting group, the Kilronan Players, in 1917. But his father would not hear of it. O'Dea was apprenticed to an optician in Edinburgh, Scotland, where he qualified as an optician. He returned to Dublin where, aged 21, he set up his own business which he was, eventually, to give to his sister, Rita. In his spare time he took part in amateur productions of Ibsen and Chekhov. From 1920 he was in the Irish theatre in Hardwicke Street working with actor-producer John McDonagh. In 1922 he made a series of comedy films for Norman Whitten.Ruth Barton, Irish National Cinema, Routledge (2004) - Google Books p. 40 After working in plays by Shaw for a few years he rejoined McDonagh in revues, the first of which, Dublin To-Night, was produced at the Queen's Theatre in 1924. In 1927 he took to the stage full-time. In 1928, this company's first production Here We Are won international acclaim, and in December of the same year it produced its first Christmas Pantomime, Sinbad the Sailor. O'Dea formed a partnership with Harry O'Donovan (died 3 November 1973) whom he first met in a production of You Never Can Tell in 1924. Their first show was Look Who's Here at Queen's. For more than two decades beginning in 1929 the duo produced two shows a year in Dublin, first in the Olympia Theatre, then in the Gaiety.Irish Times, 5 January 1950 They created O'Dea's most famous character, \\"Mrs. Biddy Mulligan\\". The role drew on Jimmy's previous manifestations as \\"Dames\\" in Variety performances and pantomimes. Biddy Mulligan was the representation (caricature, parody and stereotype) of a Dublin street-seller, with all the working-class repartee, wisdom and failings implicit. He made a number of recordings of sketches starring Mrs. Mulligan.Irish Times, 6 November 1931 Biddy Mulligan is referenced in many Dublin music hall songs such as \\"Biddy Mulligan the Pride of the Coombe\\", \\"Daffy the Belle of the Coombe\\" and \\"The Charladies' Ball\\". O'Dea made some film appearances, such as Darby O'Gill and the Little People (1959) in which he played King Brian of the little people and Johnny Nobody (1961). He also had a successful career in pantomime and toured Ireland and England many times, and is much associated with actress Maureen Potter (1925-2004), with whom he often partnered. O'Dea was also a prolific songwriter in his day. Many of his songs are still well known to this day, some of them having been sung and recorded by Dublin singer Frank Harte. Personal life O'Dea married Ursula Doyle. Maureen Potter was bridesmaid. Se√°n Lemass was best-man; he would also give the valedictory oration at O'Dea's funeral in 1965. Jimmy O‚ÄôDea had one child - Christine O‚ÄôDea - who married Ursula Doyle‚Äôs brother Noel Doyle. Christine lives in Toronto.

It can be fashioned from numerous materials, including silver, brass, sheet iron, paperboard, wood, melamine, and molded pulp. Trays range in cost from inexpensive molded pulp trays which are disposable and inexpensive melamine trays used in cafeterias, to mid-priced wooden trays used in a home, to expensive silver trays used in luxury hotels. Some examples have raised galleries, handles, and short feet for support. Trays are flat, but with raised edges to stop things from sliding off them. They are made in a range of shapes but are commonly found in oval or rectangular forms, sometimes with cutout or attached handles with which to carry them. A more elaborate device is the tray table, which is designed to accommodate a tray, or to serve as a tray itself. There are two primary kinds of tray tables.

He was the alleged deputy chairman of the ' (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the Bundestag in 1981 and 1982. According to his official biography, he was born in Morbach/Hunsr√ºck, a very rural constituency in Rhineland-Palatinate. He is Catholic and a member of the Social Democratic Party of Germany. Jakob Mierscheid was \\"born\\" on 11 December 1979 on the back of a menu in the restaurant of the Bundestag, when two members of parliament from the SPD, and , decided that their recently deceased colleague Carlo Schmid needed a worthy successor. He is now a widely known curiosity within the Bundestag and uses Twitter as means of communication.Der Spiegel, 9 April 2009, Die Welt der Phantome, Von Jochen Leffers, 2. Teil: Zwitschern mit Jakob Maria Mierscheid (The World of Phantoms, Twittering with JMM) In 1983 the party magazine Vorw√§rts published an article purportedly written by Mierscheid claiming the discovery of a \\"law\\", the Mierscheid Law, that indicated a strong correlation between the election results of the SPD in national elections and West German steel production. The Bundestag official web site carries an ostensibly serious 'biography' and a photograph purporting to depict Mierscheid. In previous versions of the photograph his fashion sense seemed very antiquated and his eyeglasses were added later. The current (2010) image shows a balding man sitting in a chair, facing away from the camera, in the middle of the empty Hall of Representatives. The German language version of the site lists 615 current names although the actual membership of the Bundestag is only 614, while the English and French language versions only list the actual membership of the Bundestag. Mierscheid has his own stationery and e-mail address and issues press releases now and then. The picture of Mierscheid at the Bundestag is based on the RTL Samstag Nacht character Karl Ranseier. The hoax is paralleled in Germany in a number of other areas, for example is a known (fictional) lawyer and is a known (fictional) diplomat. Mierscheid, Nagelmann, and Dr√§cker each have a long list of publications which have sometimes really been published in otherwise reputable media (science journals, parliament press).  Biography  The biography of Jakob Maria Mierscheid is that of a backbencher with a list of humble career steps. The official biography of the German parliament lists him as a member of the Trade Union of Peasants and Lumberjacks, member of the Sport Friends Club (treasurer 1977-1982), honorary member of the Choral Society of the Trade Union for Wood and Plastics Workers. First listed as official delegate to the Social Democrat Party congress in Hannover 1960, Mierscheid first visited the West German capital in 1967. In 1967‚Äì68 he wrote a four-part series about the \\"travel routes of the ring-tailed wood pigeons and its avionics\\" in the Central Journal of the Carrier Pigeon Breeder Association, reprinted 1969 in the Swiss-confederate journal \\"Homing Pigeon Correspondences\\". He entered the parliament in 1979. Following his time as deputy chairman of the ' (Committee for Small and Medium-Sized Businesses) of the Bundestag in 1981 and 1982, he wrote an article on the \\"Mierscheid Law\\" in the Social Democrats' journal Vorw√§rts published on 14 July 1983. His activities continued with an article in Vorw√§rts titled \\"The Solution: More market than corruption\\" published on 12 January 1985, and in 1993 he authored \\"Ecological data on the CFC replacement R134a\\" for the third H√∂chst Stone Louse Symposium in Frankfurt. Mierscheid Bridge There are some approved biography books like that of Peter Raabe: Die Mierscheid-Akte. Dokumentarische Spuren eines Phantoms (The Mierscheid File: Documentary Traces of a Phantom). Later Dietrich Sperling and Friedhelm Wollner published Jakob Mierscheid, Aus dem Leben eines Abgeordneten: Eine politische Holografie (Jakob Mierscheid, from the Life of a Member of Parliament: A Political Holography) in 1998. On 11 December 2004, Mierscheid celebrated his 25th anniversary as member of the Bundestag.tagesschau.de: \\"Ich geh√∂re zu den S√§ulen des Staatswesens\\" (I am one of the pillars of the state), 12. Dezember 2004 1 March 2013 the President of the German Bundestag Mr. Norbert Lammert said an official congratulation on occasion of Mierscheid's 80th birthday. Mierscheid did not show up to a reception given in his honour in his home-town of Mierscheid. In July 2005 the German Tagesschau announced the exit of Mierscheid from SPD to the German Linkspartei and WASG. Mierscheid's angry dementi was announced both by the Tagesschau, and an interview in Der Spiegel. After the parliament moved to Berlin, two new office buildings for members of parliament were connected with a pedestrian bridge over the Spree river. This bridge was nicknamed the \\"Mierscheid Bridge\\". Attempts to mark it with an official plate were said to have failed because \\"the nails were nuts\\" (pun on Niete meaning nut/rivet, a blank in lottery or a person that is unable to accomplish anything). After the historic defeat in the 2009 election, Mierscheid quoted Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem \\"Ulysses\\" in German to raise the spirits of his comrades in the Bundestag. Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho' We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are; One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.  Further appreciation  On Mierscheid‚Äôs 80th \\"birthday\\" in 2013, his alleged home town Morbach opened a hiking trail, a roundtrip of about 16 km (10 miles), providing humorous reflections on Mierscheid‚Äôs life and political activities on 14 information boards along the trail.

In the 1990s, Ming Pao established four overseas branches in North America; each provides independent reporting on local news and collects local advertisements. Currently, of the overseas editions, only the two Canadian editions remain: Ming Pao Toronto and Ming Pao Vancouver. In a 2019 survey from the Chinese University of Hong Kong sampling 1079 local households, Ming Pao was listed as the second most credible paid newspaper in Hong Kong. History = Launch, early days = Ming Pao was first published on 20 May 1959, and was founded by the famous Chinese Wuxia novelist Louis Cha, known better by his pseudonym Jin Yong (ÈáëÂ∫∏), and his friend, Shen Pao Sing (Ê≤àÂØ∂Êñ∞). Daisy Li Yuet-Wah won an International Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists for her work with the paper in 1994. Before British Hong Kong's handover to the People's Republic of China by the United Kingdom in 1997, Ming Pao was considered hostile to the Chinese authority. When China reunited with Hong Kong, the controversial editors of Ming Pao turned favorable towards the Chinese government. = Merger with Malaysia Sinchew and Nanyang Groups = In October 1995, the publisher of Ming Pao, Ming Pao Enterprise was taken over by Tiong Hiew King (Chinese: ÂºµÊõâÂçø). On 29 January 2007, Tiong released a proposal to merge the three media groups ‚Äì Sin Chew Media Corporation Berhad (Malaysia), Nanyang Press Holdings Berhad (Malaysia) and Ming Pao Enterprise Corporation Limited (Hong Kong). The merged group, named Media Chinese International Limited was dual-listed on the main boards of the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong and the Bursa Malaysia Securities Berhad in April 2008. All of the existing groups retain their existing publications and independent operations. The website of Ming Pao was set up in 1995, one of the earliest newspaper websites in Hong Kong. Since April 2008, Ming Pao is published by Ming Pao Newspapers Limited, a subsidiary of Media Chinese International Limited.  International development  Ming Pao set up a Toronto office in Canada in May 1993 to publish the Ming Pao Eastern Edition (), then set up a Vancouver office in October the same year for the Ming Pao Western Edition (). In April 1997, the group set up a New York office and started publishing the Ming Pao US East Coast Edition (). The journal launched in the San Francisco Bay Area in April 2004 with a print run of 25,000, the sixth Chinese newspapers to be distributed in the region. In 2007, the office also published the New York Free Newspaper (). Ming Pao New York and Ming Pao San Francisco ceased operations on 31 January and 14 February 2009, respectively. The closing of NY operations was a symbol of the weakening of ethnic newspapers of the region. The group merged the resources of Ming Pao New York and the New York Free Newspaper to create Ming Pao Daily Free News (New York) (), serving the Chinese community along the US East Coast.  Controversies  = Chinese Communist Party Influence = A 2001 report on Chinese media censorship by the Jamestown Foundation cited Ming Pao as one of four major overseas Chinese newspapers directly or indirectly controlled by Beijing.Duzhe, Mei. China Brief Vol1, Issue 10. \\"How China's Government is Attempting to Control Chinese Media in America\\" \\"Jamestown Foundation.\\" 2001 > ‚ÄúThe dominant Chinese media vehicle in America is the newspaper,\\" wrote the > report's lead author Mei Duzhe. \\"Four major Chinese newspapers are found in > the U.S.‚ÄîWorld Journal, Sing Tao Daily, Ming Pao Daily News, and The China > Press. Of these four, three are either directly or indirectly controlled by > the government of Mainland China, while the fourth (run out of Taiwan) has > recently begun bowing to pressure from the Beijing government.‚Äù The report also noted that the CCP started purchasing important Hong Kong news media companies, including Ming Pao, through third parties, in preparation for the Hong Kong hand-over to the People's Republic of China in 1997. ‚ÄúEmployees at Ming Pao's New York office have told sources that their 'true boss' is none other than the Chinese Consulate [in New York], and that they are obligated to do whatever the Consulate asks,\\" it said. A 2006 study of Ming Pao editorials noted a tendency toward self-censorship concerning criticism toward Beijing. According to a 2013 report by Center for International Media Assistance, \\"The Long Shadow of Chinese Censorship: How the Communist Party's Media Restrictions Affect News Outlets Around the World,\\": > \\"Before and after the 1997 [Hong Kong] transition, a number of influential > newspapers run as family businesses were bought by tycoons with business > interests in China and close ties to mainland officials, such as Ming Pao > Daily, Sing Tao Daily, and Sing Pao,\\" said the report. \\"Soon, a number of > observable patterns emerged at these and other outlets signaling growing > pressure within the media industry to reduce criticism of the central > government‚Ä¶\\" = Assault on former chief editor Kevin Lau = Kevin Lau, who had been chief editor of the journal until January 2014, was attacked in the morning of 26 February 2014 in Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong. He was seriously injured in a targeted knife attack. It was widely speculated that the attack may have been driven by political motivation, and related to its role in investigation by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) into the offshore assets of China's leaders, including relatives of Communist Party general secretary Xi Jinping, former Premier Wen Jiabao, and several members of the National People's CongressMitra-Thakur, Sofia (28 February 2014). \\"Hong Kong: Former editor Kevin Lau Chun-to stabbed in triad-style hit \\". The Independent.Mullany, Gerry (25 February 2014). \\"Hong Kong Editor Whose Ouster Stirred Protests Is Slashed\\". The New York Times Journalists and press of the world saw the attack as an attack on press freedom. Thousands of people, led by leading journalists, attended a rally to denounce violence and intimidation of the media.Siu, Beatrice (3 March 2014). \\"Pressing the point\\" . The Standard. During the court hearings of the two suspects, one declared that he was looking to get a $100,000 reward with this attack. = Appointment of Chong Tien Siong = In 2014, the appointment of new chief editor Chong Tien Siong sparked controversy and internal revolt, due to Siong's close ties to Beijing, and was seen as a major threat to the Chinese-language newspaper's editorial independence.Lam, Jeffie & Lau, Stewart. 21 January 2014 ‚ÄúControversial new boss Chong Tien Siong may join Ming Pao in 2 weeks‚Äù South China Morning Post = Censorship on Tiananmen Massacre = Ming Pao was subject to controversy in 2015 after editor-in-chief Chong Tien-siong ordered that a story detailing the Tiananmen massacre be replaced with a story about Chinese Internet giant Alibaba as a \\"role model for young, would-be entrepreneurs\\". Chum Shun-kin said the story that was pulled contained details about the history of the massacre, including eyewitness accounts of the killing of civilians and information from diplomatic cables from Canada. The pulling of the Tiananmen story has been criticised by some, including Civic Party lawmaker Claudia Mo who said that Chong appears to \\"want to shield Beijing from embarrassment, instead of acting in the interests of the public and protecting their right to information\\". Hong Kong Journalists Association spokeswoman Shum Yee-lan called on Chong to \\"communicate\\" with his own staff. = Termination of chief editor Keung Kwok-yuen = The journal's executive chief editor, Keung Kwok-yuen (), was abruptly terminated on 20 April 2016, the same day that a report based on the Panama Papers was published on its front page. Management said that the paper's turnover had been falling in since last year and the Keung had been laid off with immediate effect due to difficult operating conditions. The timing of Keung's removal led to speculation that the Panama Papers report, which connected a number of influential individuals in the territory to tax havens abroad, may have been considered sensitive, thus being the real reason for the dismissal. Keung had written several weeks earlier about the suppression of Ten Years, a dystopian film about Hong Kong in the year 2025 that was banned in mainland China. Staff and the union publicly denounced editor-in-chief Chong Tien Siong's decision to \\"punish editorial staff who have different opinions\\", and questioned the cost reduction pretext as an excuse. Journalists at Ming Pao manifested the concern felt by the media at large, several of them protested by filed blank space reports in an edition the Sunday following the dismissal. =Editorials for 2019 anti-extradition bill protests= On 13‚Äì14 June 2019, Ming Pao published editorials to define the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests as a riot (), blaming the violence of the protesters. However, on 14 June, the instant news section of mingpao.com, the web portal of the publisher, published a statement to declare that the editorial represents the newspaper, but not the frontier staff of the publisher. The translator of the editorial refused to translate the article to English as well as any editorials in the future in protest. On 17 June 2019, Ming Pao published an open letter written by some of its employees criticizing the June 13 editorial for being biased towards the establishment and damaging the reputation of the newspaper.

Young, Wiley- Blackwell, 2004, , p. 23 to the 3rd century AD.Susan Heuck Allen, Finding the walls of Troy: Frank Calvert and Heinrich Schliemann at Hisarl√≠k, University of California Press, 1999, , p. 39. These Games incorporated religious festival, ceremony (including prize-giving), athletic competitions, and cultural events hosted within a stadium. In mythology In the myth of the Minotaur, Minos' son Androgeus is killed during the Panathenaic Games. Some accounts, like Pseudo-Apollodorus's Bibliotheca, state he won and his jealous competitors ambushed and murdered him. Others, such as Graeciae Descriptio by Pausanias, say he was trampled to death by a mad bull. Religious festival The competitions for which this festival came to be known were only part of a much larger religious occasion; the Great Panathenaia itself. These ritual observances consisted of numerous sacrifices to Athena (the name-sake of the event and patron deity to the hosts of the event ‚Äì Athens) as well as Poseidon and others. The Panathenaic festival was formed in order to honor the goddess Athena who had become the patron of Athens after having a competition with the god Poseidon where they were to win the favor of the Athenian people by offering the people gifts. The festival would also bring unity among the people of Athens. A sister-event to the Great Panathenaia was held every year - the Lesser Panathenaia, which was 3‚Äì4 days shorter in celebration. The competitions were the most prestigious games for the citizens of Athens, but not as important as the Olympic Games or the other Panhellenic Games. Ceremony Award ceremonies included the giving of Panathenaic amphorae which were large ceramic vessels containing olive oil given as prizes. The winner of the chariot race received as a prize one-hundred and forty Panathenaic amphorae full of olive oil.  Cultural events  The Panathenaia also included poetic and musical competitions. Prizes were awarded for rhapsodic recitation of Homeric poetry, for instrumental music on the aulus and cithara, and for singing to the accompaniment of the aulus and cithara (citharody). In addition, the Games included a reading of both the Odyssey and the Iliad. The Panathenaic Stadium The athletic events were staged at the Panathenaic Stadium, which is still in use today. In 1865, Evangelis Zappas left a vast fortune in his will with instructions to excavate and refurbish the ancient Panathenaic stadium so that modern Olympic Games could be held every four years \\"in the manner of our ancestors\\".The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, p. 42 The Panathenaic stadium has hosted Zappas Olympics in 1870,The Modern Olympics, A Struggle for Revival by David C. Young, Chapters 4 & 13 and 1875, as well as the modern Olympic Games in 1896 and 2004. The stadium also hosted the 1906 Intercalated Games.  Contests  The Panathenaic Games held contests in a number of musical, athletic, and equestrian events. Due to the fact that there were so many contests held, the games usually lasted a little over a week. On a fourth century marble block, experts explain that on the block is written a program for the games, as well as individual events and their prizes. The inscription also says that there are two age categories for the music events but three age categories for the athletic events. According to scholars, the age groups are boys: 12‚Äì16; beardless youths: 16‚Äì20; men: over 20. One thing that was different about these games than normal funeral games is that prizes were given to runners-up, not just the lone victor. Using the inscription, experts put together a general program like so: Day 1: Musical and Rhapsodic Contest; Day 2: Athletic Contest for Boys and Youths; Day 3: Athletic Contest for Men; Day 4: Equestrian Contest; Day 5: Tribal Contest; Day 6: Torch Race and Sacrifice; Day 7: Boat Race; Day 8: Awarding of Prizes, Feasting and Celebrations. Experts reasonably came up with how the games went based on the order of prizes which were written on the marble block. Wrestling was also a part of the contest as well as discus. The musical events which took place were Kithara players, Flute players, and singers. The athletic events were the stadion, pentathlon, wrestling, boxing, and pankration. The equestrian events were two-horse chariot race, horse race, and javelin throw on horseback. Based on the inscription, we learn that the prizes given to the men and the youth were different. Men were rewarded a certain amount of drachmas and/or a valuable crown worth a certain amount of drachmas. Boys and youths were given a certain number of amphoras of olive oil.

He was one of the most widely read contemporary satirists in the world.Ephraim Kishon, 80, Holocaust Survivor Who Became Satirist *The New York Times*, 30 January 2005Obituaries: Ephraim Kishon *The Guardian*, 1 February 2005The life of Ephraim Kishon (1924-2005), ephraimkishon.de  Biography  Ephraim Kishon was born on August 23, 1924 by the name of Ferenc Hoffmann into a middle-class Jewish family in Budapest, Hungary. In his youth he knew neither Hebrew nor Yiddish. His father worked as a bank manager and his mother was a former secretary. Kishon also had a sister who was a writer. His writing talent became evident in his youth. In 1940 he won his first prize for writing a novel for high school students. Due to the racial laws applied in Hungary during World War II, he was not allowed to continue his studies at the university and therefore he began to study jewelry making in 1942. During World War II the Nazis imprisoned him in several concentration camps. At one camp his chess talent helped him survive, as he played chess with the guards. In another camp, the Germans lined up the inmates and shot every tenth person, but passed him by. He later wrote in his book The Scapegoat, \\"They made a mistake‚Äîthey left one satirist alive\\". He eventually managed to escape the concentration camps while being transported to the Sobibor extermination camp in Nazi German Occupied Poland, and hid the remainder of the war disguised as \\"Stanko Andras\\", a Slovakian laborer. After the war when he returned to Budapest he discovered that his parents and sister had survived, but many other family members had been murdered in the gas chambers at Auschwitz. In 1945, he changed his surname from Hoffmann to Kishont and returned to Hungary, where he continued to study art and writing. In 1948 he completed his studies in metal sculpturing and art history and began publishing humorous articles under the name Franz Kishunt. In 1949 he immigrated to the newly founded state of Israel, together with his first wife Eva (Chawa) Klamer, to escape the Communist regime. When arriving in Israel an immigration officer officially Hebraicized his name to \\"Ephraim Kishon\\". According to Kishon, the Jewish Agency clerk asked him for his name and when he answered \\"Ferenc\\" the clerk said: There is no such thing, and wrote \\"Ephraim\\", and afterwards he went ahead and Hebraicized his family name as well, Kishon being a river near Haifa, the Israeli city on Mount Carmel. His first marriage to Eva (Chawa) Klamer in 1946 ended in divorce. In 1959, he married Sara (n√©e Lipovitz), who died in 2002. In 2003, he married the Austrian writer Lisa Witasek. Kishon had three children: Raphael (b. 1957), Amir (b. 1963), and Renana (b. 1968). In 1981, Kishon established a second home in the rural Swiss canton of Appenzell after feeling unappreciated in Israel, but remained a staunch Zionist. Kishon died on January 29, 2005 at his home in Switzerland at the age of 80 following a cardiac arrest. His body was flown to Israel and he was buried at the Trumpeldor Cemetery in Tel Aviv. Being a popular Israeli writer, he still felt he was getting negative treatment from the Israeli media due to the fact he was rather right wing in his political views.  Literary career Kishon initially lived in the \\"Sha'ar Ha'Aliyah\\" transit camp near Haifa, and soon afterwards moved to Kibbutz Kfar Hahoresh, in which he worked as a nurse while learning the Hebrew language during his free time with the help of his neighbor Joseph Bilitzer. During this period he wrote several humorous lists for the Hungarian newspaper \\"√öj Kelet\\". Afterwards Kishon moved to a housing project. He studied Hebrew at the Ulpan \\"Etzion\\" in Jerusalem, and soon became proficient in the language. Nevertheless, his heavy Hungarian accent accompanied him throughout his life. Mastering the Hebrew language with remarkable speed, in 1951 Kishon began writing a satirical column in the easy- Hebrew daily, Omer, after only two years in the country. Later on Kishon began writing for the newspaper \\"Davar\\" (which was very influential at the time) in which he published a satire called \\"The Blaumilch Canal\\". That same year he published his first book in Israel \\"Ha-ole Ha-Yored le-Chayenu\\"- \\"The Pestering Immigrant\\", (a pun on the Hebrew word for \\"Immigrant\\") which was written in Hungarian and translated into Hebrew by Avigdor Meiri. The book was mostly about the life experiences of new immigrants in Israel during the 1950s. In 1952 Kishon began writing a regular satirical column called \\"Had Gadya\\" (\\"One Young Goat\\" in Aramaic, taken from the Passover Seder liturgy) in the daily Hebrew tabloid \\"Ma'ariv\\". Kishon kept writing the column for about 30 years, while in the first two decades he published a new column almost every day. Within a few years after launching his writing career in Israel Kishon became one of the most prominent humorists and satirists in the country. Ephraim Kishon at a simultaneous game of chess by Vladimir Kramnik, Dortmund 2001, left at the back of Kishon the President of the German Chess Federation (). Kishon's extraordinary linguistic inventiveness and flair for creating characters was carried over into his work for the theater. Collections of his humorous writings have appeared in Hebrew and in translation. Among the English translations are Look Back Mrs. Lot (1960), Noah's Ark, Tourist Class (1962), The Seasick Whale (1965), and two books on the Six-Day War and its aftermath, So Sorry We Won (1967), and Woe to the Victors (1969). Two collections of his plays have also appeared in Hebrew: Shemo Holekh Lefanav (1953) and Ma¬¥arkhonim (1959). Kishon's books have been translated into 37 languages and sold particularly well in Germany. Kishon rejected the idea of universal guilt for the Holocaust. He said: ‚ÄúIt gives me great satisfaction to see the grandchildren of my executioners queuing up to buy my books.‚Äù Until his death in 1979, Friedrich Torberg translated his work into German. Thereafter Kishon did the German translations himself.  Chess  Kishon was a lifelong chess enthusiast, and took an early interest in chess-playing computers. In 1990, German chess computer manufacturer Hegener & Glaser together with Fidelity produced the Kishon Chesster, a chess computer distinguished by the spoken comments it would make during a game. Kishon wrote the comments to be humorous, but were also carefully chosen to be relevant to chess and the position in the game.Ephraim Kishon (Chessbase.com news)‚Äî biography and involvement with chess computers  Published works  = Books= * Ha-ole Ha-Yored le-Chayenu (1951) * Thousand of Gadia and Gadia (1954) * Ein Kamonim (1955) * Do not worry (1957) * Skeches (1957) * It all depends (1958) * Be-Echad Ha-Emeshim (1961) * He and She (1963) * Somersaults (1964) * Bone in the throat (1966) * So sorry we won!

Miners pose with lunch pails in hand on a mine rock pile outside of the Tamarack mineshaft. This mine was one of the most productive mines in the Copper Country. The Copper Country is an area in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan in the United States, including Keweenaw County, Michigan, Houghton, Baraga and Ontonagon counties as well as part of Marquette County. The area is so named as copper mining was prevalent there from 1845 until the late 1960s, with one mine (the White Pine mine) continuing through 1995. In its heyday in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century, the area was the world's greatest producer of copper. Native copper 13-oz. nugget of native copper, Keweenaw County, Michigan. Size 9.5 x 8.6 x 1.7 cm. Native copper from the Keweenaw Peninsula Michigan about 2.5 inches (6.4 cm) long. The Copper Country is highly unusual among copper-mining districts in that the copper was predominantly in the form of copper metal ‚Äì \\"native copper\\" ‚Äì rather than the copper oxides or copper sulfides that form the copper ore at almost every other copper-mining district. History Native Americans mined copper from small pits as early as 3000 B.C. on this peninsula surrounded by the waters of Lake Superior. Douglass Houghton, the State Geologist of Michigan in the mid 1800s and later to become mayor of Detroit, reported on the copper deposits in 1841. The first successful copper mine, the Cliff mine, began operations in 1845, and spurred by venture capital from Boston and other East Coast investors, many other mines quickly followed. Mining of the most productive deposit, the Calumet conglomerate, began in 1865. Mining took place along a belt that stretched about 100 miles southwest to northeast. While mining continues on a small scale, tourism and logging are now the area's major industries. Immigrants to Copper Country Initially, Irish, Cornish, French-Canadian and German immigrants came to mine copper on the peninsula. They were followed by large numbers of Finns, Swedes, Danes, Sami and Norwegians who immigrated to the Upper Peninsula, especially the Keweenaw Peninsula, to work in the mines. The immigration of people from Finland peaked from 1899 to World War I. Slovenes, Croatians, and Italians emigrated from about 1880, the first two groups sometimes called Austrians as their homelands were then part of the Austrian Empire. Polish people also were attracted to this successful mining area. Thus the pattern in this boom period was first the native Americans and people from the British Isles, French Canada and Western Europe, followed by people from the Nordic countries, and then by people from Southern and Eastern Europe. The Finns in particular stayed on and prospered even after the copper mines closed, while most moved on to other mining areas or homesteaded in other Midwestern states. The list of ethic groups included the aforementioned Nordic peoples, Chinese; Cornish; Croatians; French Canadians; Germans; Irish; Italians; Native Americans; Poles; and Slovenes. After the copper mining Popular tourist destinations include the cities of Copper Harbor and Houghton, and the Porcupine Mountains with Lake of the Clouds. Snowmobiling is very popular in the winter, and snowmobile trails are found in most areas. The Copper Country is largely rural, and much of it has been designated as state parks or similar designations. These include McLain State Park, Porcupine Mountains State Park, and the Copper Country State Forest. The Keweenaw National Historical Park includes several important sites relating to the area's copper-mining history. Institutions of higher education include Finlandia University in Hancock, founded in 1896 as Suomi College, and Michigan Technological University in Houghton, originally established in 1885 as the Michigan School of Mines. Finlandia University is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, reflecting the spiritual heritage of the region's many Finnish immigrants. Michigan Tech was founded in response to the needs of the copper mines. =Winter snowfall= The Copper Country averages more snowfall than any part of the USA east of the Mississippi River, and more snowfall than any non-mountainous region of the continental United States.

The first volume was released in 1994, the second in 1996, and the rest annually from 1998 to 2005. The albums included artists from Epitaph's roster as well as from its subsidiary label ANTI- and its partnership labels Hellcat Records and Burning Heart Records. In total the series included 257 songs contributed by 88 different artists. Rancid and Pennywise are the only bands to appear on all 10 volumes. Scott Radinsky appears on all 10, 1 with Ten Foot Pole and 9 with Pulley. As its title implied, the series featured mostly punk rock and various punk subgenres such as garage punk, hardcore punk, pop punk, post-hardcore, ska punk, skate punk, and street punk. However, as the series went on and the labels' rosters diversified, the music of the Punk-O-Rama compilations grew to include additional styles of music such as alternative hip hop, alternative rock, digital hardcore, emo, experimental music, garage rock, indie rock, metalcore, psychobilly, and screamo. Artwork for the series was inconsistent over the first four installments, with cover art and layout provided by varying artists and designers. C. Martin provided artwork and layout for both the fifth and sixth volumes, though they had differing styles and themes. Nick Pritchard of Metrosea.com provided artwork and layout for the final four volumes of the series, which adopted a similar look and style. Epitaph also organized several Punk-O-Rama tours featuring bands that had contributed to the compilations, such as Agnostic Front, All, The Distillers, Guttermouth, Millencolin, Straight Faced, and the Voodoo Glow Skulls. Occasionally these would be accompanied by special Punk-O-Rama tour sampler CDs that differed from the main. series of compilation albums. In 2003 the label published the DVD Punk-O-Rama: The Videos, Volume 1, including 22 music videos and \\"The Epitaph Story\\", a short film relating the history of the label. Though a second volume was never published, the subsequent ninth and tenth albums in the compilation series included DVDs of music videos as well. In 2006 Epitaph announced the retirement of the Punk-O-Rama brand in favor of a new series titled Unsound, the less genre-specific title being more conducive to the label's expanding roster of musical styles. However, only one compilation was published under the Unsound banner before that series was also discontinued.

The following year saw the start of Epitaph Records' new compilation series called Unsound. This is one of only two, along with the previous entry, to be released as a two-disc with a DVD. The DVD features current music videos by bands on the CD, with the exception of C. Aarme, The Weakerthans, The Black Keys, Atmosphere, Horrorpops and Eyedea & Abilities who do not appear on the CD. Additionally, of the bands that appear on both the CD and the DVD, only The Bouncing Souls and Roger Miret and the Disasters have the same song on each, with \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" and \\"Riot, Riot, Riot\\" respectively. Although most of the tracks on the CD were previously released, this entry features more unreleased tracks than any other in the series. \\"Shoot Me in the Smile\\" by The Matches, \\"News From The Front\\" by Bad Religion (however, the song was a bonus track on certain regional releases of Stranger Than Fiction), \\"Mixin' Up Adjectives\\" by This Is Me Smiling, \\"From the Tops of Trees\\" by Scatter the Ashes, \\"Mission from God\\" by The Offspring, \\"Bloodstain\\" by Pulley and \\"Not the Way\\" by The Special Goodness\\" were all previously unreleased as was the live version of \\"Anchors Aweigh\\" by The Bouncing Souls.

Epitaph chose to change the name of the compilation series because the name \\"Punk-O-Rama\\", especially in its later releases, no longer reflected the wide range of music released on the compilations. Unsound is similar to the last two entries in the Punk-O- Rama series in that it is a two-disc set with a CD and a DVD, which contains music videos of bands on the CD.

Early life The Jerome Mansion on Madison Avenue, New York City ()Jennie Jerome was born in the Cobble Hill section of Brooklyn in 1854,G. H. L. Le May, \\"Churchill, Jeanette [Lady Randolph Churchill] (1854‚Äì1921)\\", rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online ed., May 2006, accessed 18 September 2010 the second of four daughters (one died in childhood) of financier, sportsman, and speculator Leonard Jerome and his wife Clarissa (always called Clara), daughter of Ambrose Hall, a landowner. Jerome's father was of Huguenot extraction, his forebears having emigrated to America from the Isle of Wight in 1710. Hall family lore insists that Jennie had Iroquois ancestry through her maternal grandmother;Ralph G. Martin Jennie: The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill‚ÄîThe Romantic Years, 1854‚Äì1895, 9th printing, 1969 however, there is no research or evidence to corroborate this. She was raised in Brooklyn, Paris, and New York City. She had two surviving sisters, Clarita (1851‚Äì1935) and Leonie (1859‚Äì1943). Another sister, Camille (1855‚Äì1863) died when Jennie was nine.Anne Saba, American Jennie, Norton, 2008, page 13 There is some disagreement regarding the time and place of her birth. A plaque at 426 Henry St. gives her year of birth as 1850, not 1854. However, on 9 January 1854, the Jeromes lived nearby at number 8 Amity Street (since renumbered as 197). It is believed that the Jeromes were temporarily staying at the Henry Street address, which was owned by Leonard's brother Addison, and that Jennie was born there during a snowstorm. A noted beauty (an admirer, Lord d'Abernon, said that there was \\"more of the panther than of the woman in her look\\"), Jennie Jerome worked as a magazine editor in early life. Personal life leftLady Randolph was a talented amateur pianist, having been tutored as a girl by Stephen Heller, a friend of Chopin. Heller believed that his young pupil was good enough to attain \\"concert standard\\" with the necessary \\"hard work\\", of which, according to author Mary S Lovell, he was not confident she was capable.Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.28. Randolph served as the chair of the hospital committee for the American Women's War Relief Fund starting in 1914. This organization helped fund and staff two hospitals during World War I. =First marriage= Lord and Lady Randolph (pregnant with Winston) in Paris (1874) by Georges Penabert Jennie Jerome was married for the first time on 15 April 1874, aged 20, at the British Embassy in Paris, to Lord Randolph Churchill, the third son of John Winston Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough and Lady Frances Anne Vane.Anita Leslie. Jennie: The Life of Lady Randolph Churchill, 1969 The couple had met at a sailing regatta on the Isle of Wight in August 1873, having been introduced by the Prince of Wales, the future King Edward VII.Library of Congress 'Churchill and the Great Republic' exhibition notes Although they became engaged within three days of this initial meeting, the marriage was delayed for months while their parents argued over settlements.William Manchester, The Last Lion, By this marriage, she was properly known as Lady Randolph Churchill and would have been addressed in conversation as Lady Randolph. Lady Randolph with her two sons, John and Winston, 1889 The Churchills had two sons: Winston (1874‚Äì1965), the future prime minister, was born less than eight months after the marriage. According to his biographer William Manchester, Winston was most likely conceived before the marriage, rather than born prematurely. A recent biography has stated that he was born two months prematurely after Lady Randolph \\"had a fall\\". When asked about the circumstances of his birth, Winston Churchill replied: \\"Although present on the occasion, I have no clear recollection of the events leading up to it.\\" Lady Randolph's sisters believed that the biological father of the second son, John (1880‚Äì1947) was Evelyn Boscawen, 7th Viscount Falmouth.Anne Sebba, American Jennie: The Remarkable Life of Lady Randolph Churchill\\", Norton, 2008 although most discredited that due to the boys' striking likeness to their father and each other. Lady Randolph is believed to have had numerous lovers during her marriage, including the Prince of Wales, Milan I of Serbia, Prince Karl Kinsky, and Herbert von Bismarck.Manchester, William, Winston Spencer Churchill, The Last Lion, Laurel, Boston, 1989 edition, p. 137, . As was the custom of the day in her social class, Lady Randolph played a limited role in her sons' upbringing, relying largely upon nannies, especially Elizabeth Everest. Winston worshipped his mother, writing her numerous letters during his time at school and begging her to visit him, which she rarely did. He wrote about her in My Early Life: \\"She shone for me like the evening star. I loved her dearly ‚Äì but at a distance.\\"Churchill, Winston, My Early Life, 1930, Touchstone, 1996 edition, p.28. After he became an adult, they became good friends and strong allies, to the point where Winston regarded her almost as a political mentor, more as a big sister than a mother. Lady Randolph was well-respected and influential in the highest British social and political circles. She was said to be intelligent, witty, and quick to laughter. It was said that Queen Alexandra especially enjoyed her company, although Lady Randolph had been involved in an affair with her husband, the king, which was well known to Alexandra. Through her family contacts and her extramarital romantic relationships, Lady Randolph greatly helped her husband's early career, as well as that of her son Winston. In 1909, when American impresario Charles Frohman became sole manager of The Globe Theatre, the first production was His Borrowed Plumes, written by Lady Randolph Churchill. Although Mrs Patrick Campbell produced and took the lead role in the play, it was a commercial failure. It was at this point that Campbell began an affair with Lady Randolph's then husband, George Cornwallis- West.Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.259. =Later marriages= Lord Randolph died in 1895, aged 45. His death freed Jennie to move effortlessly in spite of her lack of money; she mixed in the highest London society circles, and was much admired by the Prince of Wales. Attending a party hosted by Daisy Warwick, Jennie was introduced to George Cornwallis-West, a captain in the Scots Guards who was just 16 days older than Winston; he was instantly smitten, and they spent much time together. George and Jennie were married on 28 July 1900 at St Paul's Church, Knightsbridge. Around this time, Jennie became well known for chartering the hospital ship to care for those wounded in the Second Boer War, for which she was awarded the decoration of the Royal Red Cross (RRC) in the South Africa Honours list published on 26 June 1902. She received the decoration in person from King Edward VII on 2 October that year, during a visit to Balmoral Castle. In 1908, she wrote her memoirs The Reminiscences of Lady Randolph Churchill. George doted on Jennie, amorously nicknaming her \\"pussycat\\". However, they drifted apart. The Churchills were becoming a dedicated literary family, and George, who was a financial failure in the City, slowly fell out of love with his wife, who was old enough to be his mother. Short of money, Jennie contemplated selling the family home in Hertfordshire to move into the Ritz Hotel in Piccadilly. George was in fragile health when he recuperated at the royal skiing resort of St Moritz. Jennie took to writing plays for the West End, in many of which the star was Mrs. Patrick Campbell. Jennie separated from George in 1912, and they were divorced in April 1914, whereupon Cornwallis-West married Mrs. Campbell. Jennie dropped the surname Cornwallis-West, and resumed, by deed poll, the name Lady Randolph Churchill. Her third marriage, on 1 June 1918, was to Montagu Phippen Porch (1877‚Äì1964), a member of the British Civil Service in Nigeria, who was younger than Winston by three years. At the end of World War I, Porch resigned from the colonial service. After Jennie's death, he returned to West Africa, where his business investments had proven successful.Lovell, Mary S., The Churchills, Little Brown, London, 2011, p.332, . Death Jennie's grave at St Martin's Church, Bladon In May 1921, while Montagu Porch was away in Africa, Jennie slipped while coming down a friend's staircase wearing new high-heeled shoes, breaking her ankle. Gangrene set in, and her left leg was amputated above the knee on 10 June. She died at her home at 8 Westbourne Street in London on 29 June, following a haemorrhage of an artery in her thigh (resulting from the amputation). She was 67 years old.Jenkins, Roy., Churchill, Pan Books, London, 2002 edition, pp.353‚Äì354, . She was buried in the Churchill family plot at St Martin's Church, Bladon, Oxfordshire, next to her first husband. Cocktail misattribution The invention of the Manhattan cocktail is sometimes erroneously attributed to Jennie Churchill, who supposedly asked a bartender to make a special drink to celebrate the election of Samuel J. Tilden to the New York governorship in 1874. However, though the drink is believed to have been invented by the Manhattan Club (an association of New York Democrats) on that occasion; Jennie could not have been involved, as she was in Europe at the time, about to give birth to her son Winston later that month. Portrayals Jennie Churchill was portrayed by Anne Bancroft in the film Young Winston (1972) and by Lee Remick in the British television series Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill (1974). A play \\"Lady Randy\\" written by Anne Undeland was staged in 2019 at the WAM Theatre in Lenox, Massachusetts.

It was developed for the Apple II and ported to the Atari 8-bit family and Commodore 64 in 1983. Pinball Construction Set created a new genre of video games--the \\"builder\\" or \\"construction set\\" class of games. Users can construct their own virtual pinball machine by dropping bumpers, flippers, spinners and other pinball paraphernalia onto a table. Attributes such as gravity and the physics model can be modified. Users can save their creations and develop custom artwork to go along with them. Tables can be saved on floppy disks and freely traded; Pinball Construction Set is not needed to play the tables. The game was later released for the IBM PC (as a self-booting disk) in 1985 and Macintosh in 1986. Development Pinball Construction Set title screen on an IBM PC A blank pinball machine with the user interface visible on an IBM PC Bill Budge, the author of the popular Raster Blaster pinball game for the Apple II series, began developing Pinball Construction Set in July 1982. He did not want to write another game (\\"all the current (arcade) games are either maze games or Pong; I didn't want any part of that\\"), but began experimenting with game and graphical tools he had written. As part of the development process he purchased and disassembled an old Gottlieb Target Alpha pinball machine, so his new project could accurately depict its components. Budge does not enjoy playing video games, and described having to play pinball for months while developing Pinball Construction Set as \\"sheer torture\\". The project was very ambitious, especially for the Apple's limited memory and graphics capabilities. While Budge did not work on the Apple Lisa project as an Apple employee from 1980 to 1981 he was aware of it and the Graphic User Interface research at Xerox PARC, and gave Pinball Construction Set a Lisa-like user interface. He originally published and distributed the game via his publishing company BudgeCo in late 1982; the box art was a photograph of the parts of the disassembled pinball machine. It did not sell well, however, as BudgeCo did not have the distribution network that other, larger companies did. Budge agreed to have EA to publish his game when Trip Hawkins approached him in 1983. Raster Blaster and other projects had already made Budge a celebrity among Apple II owners, and his name was much larger than the name of the software on EA's Pinball Construction Set box art. Reception Pinball Construction Sets sales had surpassed 250,000 copies by November 1989, and it ultimately sold over 300,000 copies in all platforms. EA followed with Music Construction Set, Adventure Construction Set, and Racing Destruction Set all from different authors. Pinball Construction Sets scope and flexibility on a 48K Apple II was impressive. Steve Wozniak called it \\"the greatest program ever written for an 8-bit machine\\", and for thousands the software was their first experience with a GUI. Computer Gaming World in 1983 considered the software toy revolutionary, and easy to understand because of its representative icons and drag-and-drop method of constructing a table; the magazine stated that \\"there's something almost magical about the way this product works. You take everything it does for granted after just a few minutes\\". The nine-page manual was considered \\"overkill\\", since Pinball Construction Set required no programming knowledge; an eight-year-old had no problems creating his own tables. Reviewing the Atari 800 version in their \\"Arcade Alley\\" column, Video magazine described Pinball Construction Set as a \\"remarkably clever and easy-to-use program\\", and noted that a third party company had already published a suite of pre-made pinball games for use with the construction set. BYTE stated in 1984 \\"it is hard to find anything wrong with this game ... Creativity is encouraged. [Users] are gently encouraged and aided. This is valuable for children and inexperienced players and computer users\\". InfoWorld compared the game's importance to that of Scott Adams's Adventureland, and predicted that it \\"is sure to have lots of children and grandchildren\\". Ahoy! wrote \\"you owe it to yourself to pick up Pinball Construction Set. It is among the best home entertainment programs ever written\\". The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the \\"pinball wizard's dream\\" an overall A+ rating, praising the user interface as \\"exceptionally human engineered\\". Compute! listed it in 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", calling the game \\"a programming work of art ... a classic that never seems to grow old\\". Orson Scott Card stated in the magazine in 1989 that the program was so flexible that his son used it as a graphics program. =Awards= In 1984 Pinball Construction Set received a Certificate of Merit in the category of \\"1984 Most Innovative Video Game/Computer Game\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards. One month later Softline readers named the game the ninth most-popular Apple and Atari program of 1983. Computer Gaming World in 1996 declared Pinball Construction Set the 50th-best computer game ever released, and ranked it #1 in the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games. Pinball Construction Set is an inductee in GameSpy's Hall of Fame.GameSpy Hall of Fame from GameSpy In 2008, Pinball Construction Set was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for \\"User Generated Content/Game Modification\\". Bill Budge accepted the award.2008 Tech Emmy Winners from Kotaku.com Legacy A version for the Coleco Adam combined with Hard Hat Mack under the title The Best of Electronic Arts was completed but not released. In 1993, Budge wrote a version of Pinball Construction Set for the Sega Genesis with the name Virtual Pinball. Will Wright cited the game as an inspiration.GDC 2012: The games that influenced our influential game designers from Gamasutra.com In 2013, Budge released the source code to the Atari 8-bit family version of Pinball Construction Set to the public on GitHub under the MIT license.I just pushed the source for Pinball Construction Set to github (thanks to Scott Cronce at EA) on twitter.com See also *Adventure Construction Set *Music Construction Set *Racing Destruction Set References External links  *Pinball Construction Set at Atari Mania * Category:1982 video games Category:Apple II games Category:Ariolasoft games Category:Atari 8-bit family games Category:Commercial video games with freely available source code Category:Commodore 64 games Category:Electronic Arts games Category:Mac OS games Category:Pinball video games Category:Software using the MIT license Category:Video game development software Category:Video game level editors Category:Video games developed in the United States ","title":"Pinball Construction Set"},{"id":"268316","text":"2DTV is a British satirical animated television show, produced by Giles Pilbrow for ITV, and premiered on 14 October 2001. The programme is considered the spiritual successor of Spitting Image, a 1980s television series that used puppets and involved the work of Pilbrow, in terms of satirising prominent politicians, television personalities and celebrities, including giving their characters unique design quirks and portrayals, but through computer-generated animation. The voice cast included the talents of Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, and Mark Perry. The programme ran for five series, before being axed on 23 December 2004 due to falling viewing figures. It was succeeded in 2008 by the short-lived series Headcases. Background 2DTV employed the same satirical style as Spitting Image, but used animation rather than puppets. The animation was produced using computer graphics, frequently with animators working up to the day of broadcast. Series producer Giles Pilbrow was a veteran of Spitting Image, as were some of the voice artists on the show. The series was directed by Tim Searle. 2DTV was first broadcast in March 2001, however, an unbroadcast pilot episode was recorded nearly six months beforehand. The pilot episode featured a resident newsreader, played by Alistair McGowan, however, his character was not carried over when a full seven part first series was commissioned by ITV. Each episode in the first series lasted ten minutes. In April 2002, a second seven episode series began broadcasting, once again, with each episode lasting ten minutes. In July 2002, the series spawned its own official single, \\"Shoot the Dog\\", which was performed by George Michael. The music video for \\"Shoot the Dog\\" features an animated Michael, plus several other characters from 2DTV, performing the song. In November 2002, a commercial for the home media compilation, The Best of 2DTV, was banned by the BACC. The commercial depicted George W. Bush taking a VHS out of its case, and putting it in a toaster. Ofcom stated that advertisements for products cannot appear to be endorsed by someone without their permission ‚Äì in this case George W. Bush. The original advert was reworked into a sketch in which Bush writes a letter complaining about his portrayal in the media as a moron, then \\"posts\\" the letter in a toaster. The programme creators then proposed a commercial satirising Osama Bin Laden, and were informed that this would also be banned on the grounds that Bin Laden would have to give permission for his image to be used. Another commercial satirised David Beckham by compiling his list for Christmas and asking his wife, \\"how do you spell DVD?\\". The banning was later overturned on the grounds that the commercial was legitimate satire, and the commercial was shown unedited. The programme creators claimed that the controversy had generated more interest in the show than the adverts could ever have done alone. For the third series, each episode was extended to twenty minutes, including advertisements. After the third series, many of the original cast members, including Jon Culshaw, Jan Ravens, Mark Perry, decided to depart the series following an announcement that the fourth series would be extended to thirty minutes per episode. As such, new cast members Lewis MacLeod, Kate O'Sullivan and Enn Reitel were drafted in to take over. They appeared alongside the only remaining original cast member, Dave Lamb. All four returned for a fifth series in 2004, however, due to falling ratings, its broadcast occurred in the graveyard slot, and as such, the show was axed in December 2004.

In the Roman and medieval period it had Jewish population, and by the 16th century it became entirely Muslim. After a period of desertion, it was resettled by Algerian Arabs. It was depopulated in 1948 during the Operation Hiram by the Israeli attacking brigade Sheva' Brigade. History =Archaeology= In 1875, Victor Gu√©rin found major ruins here. He described the place as a destroyed Arab village.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 451-2 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine found here: \\"Modern and ancient ruins; a spring in a rock-cut cave, ancient foundations of good-sized stones; the foundations of a small rectangular building to the west of the eastern portion of the ruin. Some rock-cut tombs and many caves in hills around.\\"Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 242 Starting in 1981 Zvi Ilan excavated in sites next to the 20th century village in different directions. Excavations revealed signs of a long-standing community, and Jewish presence at some periods. An ancient synagogue built in the late 4th or early 5th century,Goodman et al, 2002, p. 841 and a related Beth midrash of the 7th century, a cache of coins ranging from the 5th to 9th centuries, a necropolis partly of the 1st century CE, and sherds from Roman to early Ottoman period. There are remains of a defensive wall of large stones, and a hewn moat.Ilan, 1983 (Hebrew), and English abstract =Written sources= Classic era Based on the archaeological findings and the name Marus, archaeologist Zvi Ilan suggested Marus is to be identified with the town Meroth. Meroth () is mentioned by Josephus as a border town between Jewish Galilee and Tyre in the First Jewish‚ÄìRoman War, and a place fortified early in the war. Previous suggestions as to its location included Maroun al-Ras, and Meiron, which show less archaeological parallels. The name possibly derives from (Me'arot, caves). Middle ages Marus is probably mentioned in a Samaritan medieval manuscript, again as the border of Tyre, and in a pilgrimage guide of the 14th century. Ottoman era In 1596, Marus was part of the Ottoman Empire, a village in the nahiya (subdistrict) of Jira under the liwa' (\\"district\\") of Safad, with a population of 176. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat, barley, and fruits as well as on goats.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 178. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 475Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied from the Safad-district was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9. All the villagers were Muslim.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 178 In the second half of the 19th century Algerian followers of Abdelkader El Djezairi have been defeated by the French in Algeria, and sought refuge in another part of the Ottoman Empire. They were given lands in various locations in Ottoman Syria, including Marus, and the close-by Dayshum, Ammuqa, Al-Husayniyya and Tulayl.Abbasi, 2007 (Hebrew). Non- Hebrew version in The Maghreb Review, 28(1), 2003 pp. 41-59. British Mandate era In the British mandate period the village was classified as a hamlet by the Palestine Index Gazetteer.Khalidi, 1992, p. 475 In the 1922 census of Palestine, Marus had a population of 45; all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 increasing in the 1931 census to 59, still all Muslims, in a total of 12 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 108 In the 1945 statistics, the population was 80 Muslims, and the total land area was 3,183 dunums.

Act Now to Stop War and End Racism (ANSWER), also known as International A.N.S.W.E.R. and the ANSWER Coalition, is a United States‚Äìbased protest umbrella group consisting of many antiwar and civil rights organizations. Formed in the wake of the September 11th attacks, ANSWER has since helped to organize many of the largest anti-war demonstrations in the United States, including demonstrations of hundreds of thousands against the Iraq War. The group has also organized activities around a variety of other issues, ranging from the Israel/Palestine debate to immigrant rights to Social Security to the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles. ANSWER characterizes itself as anti- imperialist, and its steering committee consists of socialists, communists, civil rights advocates, and left-wing or progressive organizations from the Muslim, Arab, Palestinian, Filipino, Haitian, and Latin American communities. Many of ANSWER's lead organizers had ties to the International Action Center and Workers World Party at the time of ANSWER's founding. ANSWER has faced criticism from other anti-war groups for its affiliations, tactics at demonstrations, and allegedly sectarian approach to joint anti-war work. It also faced criticism from various sources for its claimed anti-Zionist politics. The organizations national headquarters are in Washington, D.C.  Major protest actions  = 2001‚Äì02 = ANSWER's first major action was a September 29, 2001, \\"Anti-War, Anti-Racist\\" political rally and march in Washington, D.C., primarily in protest of the impending U.S. invasion of Afghanistan. An estimated 8,000 people participated. ANSWER's next major demonstration took place on April 20, 2002, which according to ANSWER's website, drew 100,000 people to Washington in the largest pro-Palestinian demonstration in U.S. history. On October 26 of that year, ANSWER held a demonstration against Congress' vote to authorize the use of force against Iraq, which according to its website drew 100,000 in San Francisco and 200,000 in Washington, D.C.According to police and the media, the numbers were about a tenth as many. Extreme left groups are notorious for grossly inflating the numbers in attendance at their rallies. = 2003‚Äì04 = ANSWER called antiwar demonstrations on January 18, 2003, in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, which were each attended by 200,000 people, according to the group's website. ANSWER was one of several groups organizing the U.S. component of the worldwide February 15, 2003 anti-war protest, which was, across the globe, the largest anti-war rally that has ever taken place. ANSWER sponsored emergency demonstrations just before the launch of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, on March 15, 2003, which according to its website drew 100,000 people each in San Francisco and Washington. With United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), it cosponsored an anti-occupation protest in Washington on October 25 of that year which, again according to the group's website, brought out 100,000 people in Washington. ANSWER called for national anti-war, pro-Palestinian, and anti- Haitian coup demonstrations on March 20, 2004, (the first anniversary of the invasion of Iraq.) The protest in New York, cosponsored by UFPJ, was attended by 100,000 according to the ANSWER website. ANSWER participated in the March for Women's Lives on April 25, and the protests of the 2004 Republican National Convention from August 30 to September 2. = 2005‚Äì06 = ANSWER and UFPJ jointly sponsored a rally in Washington, D.C. on September 24, 2005, with attendance estimated by police at 150,000 and by organizers at 300,000 people. ANSWER was involved with demonstrations on May Day, 2006, in support of rights for undocumented immigrants, which brought out several million people across the U.S. These protests were organized by a number of groups unrelated to ANSWER as well. In late June 2006, ANSWER organized and participated in local rallies against the Israeli invasion of Gaza. Shortly after Israel invaded Lebanon two weeks later, ANSWER ‚Äî along with the National Council of Arab Americans and the Muslim American Society ‚Äî initiated a call for protests on August 12, 2006, against the \\"U.S.-Israeli War on the People of Lebanon and Palestine.\\" Organizers estimated that the August 12 demonstrations drew 30,000 protesters in Washington, 10,000 in San Francisco, and 5,000 in Los Angeles. = 2007-2010= Marching during the March 17, 2007 anti-war protest in Washington, D.C. ANSWER called national antiwar demonstrations in San Francisco and Washington, DC for September 15, 2007. According to the group, the attendance was 100,000. ANSWER joined with other groups to organize the March 20, 2010 anti-war protest in Washington, DC. = 2010-2020 = In response to the escalating tensions in Iraq between U.S. military and diplomats and Iraqi shia militias in correspondence with Iran, ANSWER called for a national demonstration against war in Iraq and aggression against Iran. The call for the demonstrations was made public via social media on January 1st, 2020 , but the importance of the proposed demonstrations on January 3rd, 2020, when the U.S. targeted and bombed a convoy of vehicles in the Baghdad International Airport, killing the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani and several key figures in the Iraqi Popular Mobilization Forces, including the militia's Deputy Chairman Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. On January 4th, 2020, over 70 demonstrations, led by ANSWER and other organizations in coordination with ANSWER, took place across the United States. Demonstrations ranged from smaller in size in small cities to large gatherings in cities like New York City and Chicago. The Washington D.C. demonstration included actress Jane Fonda . = Attendance figures = ANSWER figures for the size of its March, 2007, protest were higher than corresponding San Francisco Chronicle figures. ANSWER engaged in a public dispute with the San Francisco Chronicle about the size of that demonstration. ANSWER Western Regional Coordinator Richard Becker wrote in an op-ed: > WHILE TENS of thousands of spirited anti-war marchers were still entering > the San Francisco Civic Center on Sunday, March 18... organizers got word > that a Chronicle reporter covering the event had already determined that > only 3,000 people were present... Mainstream media undercounting of > progressive demonstrations is nothing new, but this one had a magician's > touch. Analyzing the width and pace of the march together with the time required for the march to pass a certain point, Becker argues that the Chronicles estimate is \\"impossible.\\" Some on the left have also accused ANSWER of exaggerating protest attendance. An October 2007 Socialist Worker editorial penned by Todd Chretien and republished on CounterPunch asserted: \\"Ask anyone who has worked with ANSWER, and they will tell you that its organizers always double the number of people at their marches. More recently, the multiplication factor has increased.\\" Chretien describes this as \\"disorienting for the movement.\\" Member organizations Many of ANSWER's lead organizers had ties to the International Action Center and the Workers World Party (WWP) at the time of ANSWER's founding. Controversies = Relationships within the anti-war movement = Few other prominent antiwar groups in the U.S. or elsewhere have formal relationships with ANSWER, although many have participated in the major ANSWER-sponsored protests. There has been much discussion among U.S. leftist opponents of the Iraq and Afghanistan invasions of the degree to which they are or are not willing to work with ANSWER because of its affiliations. Michael Albert and Stephen R. Shalom writing in Z magazine argue that regardless of the political views of some speakers at a major antiwar demonstration, \\"as long as other speakers can and do express positions with a different point of view, the overall impact of the event will still be positive, particularly in the absence of other options. Most of the people at the demonstration will in fact be unaware of exactly who said what and whether any particular speaker omitted this or that point. What they will experience will be a powerful antiwar protest. And most of the public will see it that way too.\\"  Break with UFPJ  Although ANSWER worked with United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ) to build the September 24, 2005, Washington, D.C. rally, a December 2005 statement by the UFPJ Steering Committee says that UFPJ \\"has decided not to coordinate work with ANSWER again on a national level. The document cites three reasons for the decision: # ANSWER did not honor the agreed-upon time limits for its sections of the pre-march Rally... # ANSWER delayed the start of the March... and # ANSWER did not turn out many volunteers.\\" The document says that the UFPJ Steering Committee \\"did not have consensus\\" about the decision not to work with ANSWER, but had \\"a more than two thirds supermajority ... We make no recommendations or mandates on this issue to UFPJ member groups in local or constituency-based area...\\" ANSWER responded by saying that \\"UFPJ has publicly proclaimed its intention to split the movement,\\" and accused UFPJ of \\"a false and ugly attack on the ANSWER Coalition,\\" and of doing so for \\"embarrassingly petty and astonishingly trivial\\" reasons. Besides giving their own version of the events surrounding September 24, ANSWER's statement indicates some less trivial differences between the groups: they criticize UFPJ for its willingness to support the ideas of mainstream politicians, such as John Murtha, who are disaffected with the war, while ANSWER \\"considers it harmful to try to tailor the message of the progressive movement to please the long-awaited but fictional support from the politicians.\\" ANSWER asks, \\"Why is it that UFPJ's leadership can build a gushing \\"united front\\" with imperialist politicians but not the ANSWER Coalition, which has organized hundreds of thousands of people to promote genuine peace and self-determination?\\" At considerable length, ANSWER argued that the current split has historical roots, dating back to \\"the first Iraq war of 1990‚Äì1991, [when] some of the same leadership forces now in UFPJ chose to create a second antiwar coalition and insisted on marching under the banner \\"Economic Sanctions Not War\\" while some of those who are today in the leadership of ANSWER argued that economic sanctions were war ‚Äî and a weapon of mass destruction at that. We contended that economic sanctions against Iraq would result in a form of genocide against the Iraqi people and that the only correct position for the U.S. antiwar movement was to demand, 'No war against Iraq.'‚Ä¶ The economic sanctions ultimately took the lives of more than one million Iraqis, most of them children under the age of five, according to the UN's own statistics‚Ä¶ The question for the antiwar movement is this: are we building a movement that comprehensively challenges imperialism or are we opposed only to certain tactics employed by imperialism such as overt, unilateral military invasion?\\" Regarding the prospects of working again with UFPJ, ANSWER wrote, \\"[we regard] the united front that was formed at [our] initiative to have been remarkably successful,\\" and later, \\"Different groups may have different slogans on their banners, but they should try to overcome the forces of division so as to march shoulder to shoulder against the real enemy.\\" Although the language of the UFPJ Steering Committee statement makes the break appear definitive, they have published similar statements (rejecting future work with ANSWER) in the past, only to later agree to united demonstrations. A May 2005 decision to the same effect ‚Äî announcing a September 24 demonstration separate from the one initiated by ANSWER ‚Äî was reversed when UFPJ agreed to a united antiwar demonstration. Previous united demonstrations between the two groups took place on October 25, 2003, and March 20, 2004. = Anti-Zionism and allegations of antisemitism = The Anti- Defamation League has accused ANSWER of supporting terrorist organizations, such as Hezbollah and Hamas. The Stephen Roth Institute has said \\"Anti-Israel and antisemitic content has marked some ANSWER events.\\" The May‚ÄìJune 2003 issue of Tikkun, a progressive magazine of Jewish interests, contained a special section entitled Authoritarianism and Anti-Semitism in the Anti-War Movement? According to Tikkun, \\"many Jews report that they were encountering what they perceived to be anti-Semitism at anti-war demonstrations organized by International A.N.S.W.E.R.\\" Tikkun described the perceptions of anti- Semitism as based on Israel being singled out for criticism and ANSWER's failure to \\"acknowledge or support the right of the Jewish people to national self-determination.\\" According to ANSWER: \\"We strongly abhor all forms of racism and bigotry, including anti-Semitism. At the same time, we don't believe that criticism of Israeli government policies should be labeled as anti-Semitism any more than criticism of U.S. government policy should be labeled as anti-American.\\" = Immigration and May Day 2006 = In addition to anti-war activism, ANSWER is involved in advocacy for rights for undocumented immigrants, believing that all immigration should be legal. ANSWER became involved in immigrant rights activism through protests against Save Our State, a California-based anti-undocumented immigration protest group, and the Minutemen Project, a group which patrols the U.S.-Mexico border to prevent illegal border crossings, and which ANSWER views as practicing racist vigilantism. These protests began soon after the founding of the Minutemen group in April 2005. ANSWER has not usually been the primary organizer of these protests but has actively supported them. For example, ANSWER helped organize counter-protests of rallies held by right-wing groups in Alhambra, California on June 21, 2005; in Sacramento, California on August 29, 2005; in Los Angeles on January 7, 2006; and in Burbank, California on January 21, 2006 ANSWER has also been involved in the much larger demonstrations in opposition to the Sensenbrenner Bill and support of legalization for undocumented immigrants that have occurred across the United States since March 2006. ANSWER was not the primary organizer of the initial large protests in Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas in late March and early April, but endorsed them. ANSWER was more prominent in the promotion of a May Day \\"Day Without An Immigrant\\" strike and boycott, because this call was controversial within the immigrant rights movement, contributing to a growing division between its left-wing advocates and moderates who believed a strike and boycott would be counterproductive. ANSWER's position on the left side of this issue led to criticism; Jaime Contreras, president of the National Capital Immigrant Coalition and chairman of the local Service Employees International Union in Washington, D.C., told The Washington Post regarding ANSWER: \\"Groups... that have done nothing on immigration have no reason to stick their nose where it doesn't belong... They have no business saying, 'Let's do a strike' when it will create a humongous burden on immigrant groups. They need to stay in their box.\\" Brian Becker, ANSWER's national coordinator, responded that ANSWER has in fact been involved in immigration in the long term, and that \\"We are just part of the coalition; we are not spearheading it at all... Whatever the immigrant rights community calls for is what we support.\\" = Conflict with DC city government over posters = In August 2007, the DC Department of Public Works claimed that ANSWER broke city ordinances by putting signs, advertising a September 15 antiwar march, on utility boxes and using an adhesive that is difficult to remove. Additionally, the National Park Service, which administers many of the parks in the District of Columbia, claimed that the signs were defacement of federal property and ordered the group to remove the signs or pay for their removal. ANSWER refused to remove the signs, stating that the adhesive used was legal, water-soluble paste and the city's actions were \\"politically motivated.\\" The group said any fines would be without legal basis, and they would appeal if fines were imposed. ANSWER sued the city in federal court to stop the city from enforcing its laws until it creates a \\"constitutionally allowable and non-discriminating system\\" for determining the rules on sign posting. An ANSWER spokeswoman stated that they gained support from the publicity and intended to continue to post more posters, stickers, and banners despite the efforts of the city.

Its villagers fled to Lebanon after the Safsaf massacre in October 1948, during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War. History The village was called Safsofa in Roman times.Khalidi, 1992, p. 490 According to Yaqut, it was harried in 950 CE by the Hamdanid ruler of Aleppo, Sayf al-Dawla.Le Strange, 1890, p. 526 =Ottoman era= In the early sixteenth century CE, Safsaf was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire, and by the 1596 tax records, it was a village in the nahiyah (\\"subdistrict\\") of Jira, part of Sanjak Safad. It had a population of 25 households, an estimated 138 persons, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on several agricultural items, including wheat, barley, olives and fruits, as well as other types of produce, such as beehives and goats; a total of 3,714 ak√ße. A quarter of the revenue went to a waqf (religious endowment).H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p.177, quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 490Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1838 Safsaf was noted as a village in the Safad district,Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. 134 while in 1875 Victor Gu√©rin described it as a village with fifteen Muslim families.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 418-419 In 1881 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Safsaf as a small village situated on a plain, with a population of about 100. They also noted that \\"ornamented stones of a preexisting public building\\" had been built into the doorway of the village mosque.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 257. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 491 The villagers cultivated olive and fig trees and vineyards.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p.200. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 491 A population list from about 1887 showed Safsaf to have about 740 inhabitants, all Muslim.Schumacher, 1888, p. 190 =British Mandate era= Safsaf became a part of the British Mandate in 1922. During this time, the village lay on the eastern side of the Safad-Tarshiha highway and extended in a northeast-southwest direction. All the residents of Safsaf were Muslims. A mosque and several shops were located in the village center, and an elementary school was established during this period. Agriculture was the main economic activity, and it was both irrigated from springs and rainfed. Fruits and olives were cultivated on the land north of the village. In the 1922 census of Palestine Safsaf had a population of 521 Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Safad, p. 41 increasing in the 1931 census to 662, still all Muslims, in a total of 124 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 110 Safsaf. 1945.

Soaps are salts of fatty acids and fatty acids are mono that have long carbon chains (at least 10) e.g. sodium palmitate.  Saponification of fats  Vegetable oils and animal fats are the traditional materials that are saponified. These greasy materials, triesters called triglycerides, are mixtures derived from diverse fatty acids. Triglycerides can be converted to soap in either a one- or a two-step process. In the traditional one-step process, the triglyceride is treated with a strong base (e.g. lye), which cleaves the ester bond, releasing fatty acid salts (soaps) and glycerol. This process is also the main industrial method for producing glycerol. In some soap-making, the glycerol is left in the soap. If necessary, soaps may be precipitated by salting it out with sodium chloride. Skeletal formula of stearin, a triglyceride that is converted by saponification with sodium hydroxide into glycerol and soap. Fat in a corpse converts into adipocere, often called \\"grave wax\\". This process is more common where the amount of fatty tissue is high and the agents of decomposition are absent or only minutely present. = Saponification value = The saponification value is the amount of base required to saponify a fat sample. Soap makers formulate their recipes with a small deficit of lye to account for the unknown deviation of saponification value between their oil batch and laboratory averages. = Mechanism of base hydrolysis = The hydroxide anion of the salt reacts with the carbonyl group of the ester. The immediate product is called an orthoester. :Saponification part I Expulsion of the alkoxide generates a carboxylic acid: :Saponification part II The alkoxide ion is a strong base so that the proton is transferred from the carboxylic acid to the alkoxide ion creating an alcohol: :saponification part III In a classic laboratory procedure, the triglyceride trimyristin is obtained by extracting it from nutmeg with diethyl ether. Saponification to the soap sodium myristate takes place using NaOH in water. Treating the soap with hydrochloric acid gives myristic acid.  Saponification of fatty acids  The reaction of fatty acids with base is the other main method of saponification. In this case, the reaction involves neutralization of the carboxylic acid. The neutralization method is used to produce industrial soaps such as those derived from magnesium, the transition metals, and aluminium. This method is ideal for producing soaps that are derived from a single fatty acid, which leads to soaps with predictable physical properties, as required by many engineering applications.  Applications  = Soft versus hard soap = Depending on the nature of the alkali used in their production, soaps have distinct properties. Sodium hydroxide (NaOH) gives \\"hard soap\\"; hard soaps can also be used in water containing Mg, Cl, and Ca salts. By contrast, potassium soaps, (derived using KOH) are soft soap. The fatty acid source also affects the soap's melting point. Most early hard soaps were manufactured using animal fats and KOH extracted from wood ash; these were broadly solid. However, the majority of modern soaps are manufactured from polyunsaturated triglycerides such as vegetable oils. As in the triglycerides they are formed from the salts of these acids have weaker inter-molecular forces and thus lower melting points. = Lithium soaps = Lithium derivatives of 12-hydroxystearate and other fatty acids are important constituents of lubricating greases. In lithium-based greases, lithium carboxylates are thickeners. \\"Complex soaps\\" are also common, these being combinations of more than one acid salt, such as azelaic or acetic acid. = Fire extinguishers = Fires involving cooking fats and oils (classified as class K (US) or F (Australia/Europe/Asia)) burn hotter than most flammable liquids, rendering a standard class B extinguisher ineffective. Such fires should be extinguished with a wet chemical extinguisher. Extinguishers of this type are designed to extinguish cooking fats and oils through saponification. The extinguishing agent rapidly converts the burning substance to a non-combustible soap. This process is endothermic, meaning that it absorbs thermal energy from its surroundings, which decreases the temperature of the surroundings, further inhibiting the fire.  Oil paints  Detail of Madame X (Madame Pierre Gautreau), John Singer Sargent, 1884, showing saponification in the black dress. Saponification can occur in oil paintings over time, causing visible damage and deformation. Oil paints are composed of pigment molecules suspended in an oil binding medium. Heavy metal salts are often used as pigment molecules, such as in lead white, red lead, and zinc white. If those heavy metal salts react with free fatty acids in the oil medium, metal soaps may form in a paint layer that can then migrate outward to the painting's surface. See pages: 12‚Äì19. Saponification in oil paintings was described as early as 1912. It is believed to be widespread, having been observed in many works dating from the fifteenth through the twentieth centuries; works of different geographic origin; and works painted on various supports, such as canvas, paper, wood, and copper. Chemical analysis may reveal saponification occurring in a painting‚Äôs deeper layers before any signs are visible on the surface, even in paintings centuries old. See page 16. The saponified regions may deform the painting's surface through the formation of visible lumps or protrusions that can scatter light. These soap lumps may be prominent only on certain regions of the painting rather than throughout. In John Singer Sargent's famous Portrait of Madame X, for example, the lumps only appear on the blackest areas, which may be because of the artist‚Äôs use of more medium in those areas to compensate for the tendency of black pigments to soak it up. See pages 12‚Äì13, 15. The process can also form chalky white deposits on a painting's surface, a deformation often described as \\"blooming\\" or \\"efflorescence\\", and may also contribute to the increased transparency of certain paint layers within an oil painting over time. See pages 16, 19. Saponification does not occur in all oil paintings and many details are unresolved. See page 19. At present, retouching is the only known restoration method.

Moshe Carmel (, 17 January 1911 ‚Äì 14 August 2003) was an Israeli soldier and politician who served as Minister of Transportation for eight years. Background Born in Mi≈Ñsk Mazowiecki in the Russian Empire (today in Poland), Carmel emigrated to Mandate Palestine in 1924 when he was 13 years old. He was a founding member of kibbutz Na'an, and was active in the HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed youth movement. Between 1939 and 1941 he was imprisoned by the British authorities. During the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli war, he was commander of the Carmeli Brigade, which was especially known for Operation Hiram. He was elected to the third Knesset in 1955 as a member of Ahdut HaAvoda and was appointed Minister of Transportation. On 28 September 1956 he flew to Paris with Moshe Dayan, Shimon Peres and Golda Meir where they had meetings with French Foreign Minister Christian Pineau. The purpose of the meetings was 'to clarify ... the possibilities of joint action against Egypt'. On 29 October 1957 he suffered a broken arm after a 'Mills grenade' was thrown into the debating chamber of the Knesset. David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir were also injured. The attack was carried out by Moshe Dwek, whose motives were attributed to a dispute with the Jewish Agency, though he was also described as 'mentally unbalanced'. He retained his seat in the 1959 and 1961 elections, and was reappointed Minister of Transportation towards the end of the fifth Knesset in 1965. When Ahdut HaAvoda merged with Mapai to form the Alignment, Carmel joined the new party and retained his ministerial post in the sixth Knesset. Carmel remained a Knesset member until 1977, and published two books; Northern Campaigns (1949) and Between the Walls (1965). He died in 2003 at the age of 92.

It belongs to the eastern branch of Syriac Christianity, and employs the Divine Liturgy of Saints Addai and Mari belonging to the East Syriac Rite. Its main spoken language is Syriac, a dialect of Eastern Aramaic, and the majority of its adherents are ethnic Assyrians. The church also has an archdiocese based in India, known as the Chaldean Syrian Church of India. The Assyrian Church of the East is officially headquartered in the city of Erbil, Iraqi Kurdistan in northern Iraq; its original area also spread into southeastern Turkey, northeastern Syria and northwestern Iran, corresponding roughly to ancient Assyria. Since 2015, the primate of the Assyrian Church of the East is Catholicos-Patriarch Mar Gewargis III. The Assyrian Church of the East claims continuity with the historical Church of the East, but it is not in communion with either the Oriental Orthodox Churches or the Eastern Orthodox Church. The faction of the Assyrian Church that became in full communion with the Holy See of Rome is the Chaldean Catholic Church. After the Common Christological Declaration in 1994 between the Assyrian Church and the Catholic Church, and a 2001 theological dialogue between the churches, they drew up guidelines for faithful to have mutual admission to the eucharist between the Chaldean Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East. The Assyrian Church of the East has traditional episcopal structure, headed by the Catholicos- Patriarch. Its hierarchy is composed of metropolitan bishops and diocesan bishops, while lower clergy consists of priests and deacons, who serve in dioceses (eparchies) and parishes throughout the Middle East, India, North America, Oceania, and Europe (including the Caucasus and Russia). History Assyrian village of Geramon The Assyrian Church of the East considers itself as the continuation of the Church of the East, a church that originally developed among the Assyrians during the first century AD in Assyria, Upper Mesopotamia and northwestern Persia, east of the Byzantine Empire. It is an Apostolic church established by Thomas the Apostle, Thaddeus of Edessa, and Bartholomew the Apostle. Saint Peter, chief of the Apostles, added his blessing to the Church of the East at the time of his visit to the See at Babylon in the earliest days of the Church when stating, \\"The elect church which is in Babylon, salutes you; and Mark, my son.\\" (1 Peter 5:13). The historical distinctiveness of the Assyrian Church of the East resulted from the series of complex processes and events that occurred within the Church of the East during the transitional period that started in the middle of the 16th century, and lasted until the beginning of the 19th century. That turbulent period was marked by several consequent splits and mergers, resulting in the creation of separate branches and rival patriarchal lines. During the entire period, one of the main questions of dispute was the union with the Catholic Church. Ultimately, the pro-Catholic branches were consolidated as the Chaldean Catholic Church, while the traditional branches were consolidated as the Assyrian Church of the East. =Schisms and branches= During the patriarchal tenure of Shemon VII Ishoyahb (1539‚Äì1558), who resided in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh, an internal dissent occurred over several issues, including the question of hereditary succession to the patriarchal throne, and the question of union with the Catholic Church. By that time, Franciscan missionaries had already gained some influence over several local communities, and they took an active role in organizing the opposition to the Patriarch at that time. By the end of 1552, a pro-Catholic party had been organized in Mosul under the leadership of the priest Yohannan Sulaqa, who decided to legitimize his position by traveling to Rome and seeking confirmation by Pope Julius III (1550‚Äì1555). Receiving support from the Franciscan missionaries, he arrived in Rome and entered into full communion with the Catholic Church in February 1553. At that point, officials of the Roman Curia were given incorrect information that the elderly Patriarch Shemon VII had actually died. After some deliberation, the Pope decided to appoint Yohannan Sulaqa as \\"Patriarch of Babylon\\" in April 1553. Upon consecration, Yohannan Sulaqa took the name Shimun and by the end of the year he returned to his homeland. He started to organize the pro-Catholic party by appointing several metropolitans and bishops, thus establishing the first group of hierarchs in the newly created Eastern Catholic Patriarchate of Mosul. That was the seminal event in the early history of the Chaldean Catholic Church. Creation of the separate Eastern-Catholic hierarchy was not welcomed by the traditionalist Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb; thus an ecclesiastical rivalry between two parties was born, lasting for centuries. Initial splits and conflicts affected both communities and marked the beginning of a long series of splits and mergers within both branches. =The senior Eliya line of Alqosh= Union with Rome was actively opposed by Patriarch Shemon VII Ishoyahb, who continued to reside in the Rabban Hormizd Monastery near Alqosh. He was succeeded by his nephew Eliya (1558‚Äì1591), who was designated as Eliya \\"VII\\" in older historiography, but renumbered as Eliya \\"VI\\" in recent scholarly works. The same renumbering was applied to his successors, who all took the same name thus creating the Eliya line. During his patriarchal rule, the Eliya line preserved its traditional christology and full ecclesiastical independence. His successor was Patriarch Eliya (VII) VIII (1591‚Äì1617), who negotiated on several occasions with the Catholic Church, in 1605 and 1610, and again in 1615‚Äì1616, but without any conclusion. Further negotiations were abandoned by the next Patriarch Eliya (VIII) IX (1617‚Äì1660). David Wilmshurst noted that his successor, Patriarch Eliya (IX) X (1660‚Äì1700) also was a \\"vigorous defender of the traditional faith\\". The Eliya line of traditionalist Patriarchs continued throughout the entire 18th century, residing in the ancient Monastery of Rabban Hormizd, which was eventually attacked and looted in 1743, at the beginning of the Ottoman‚ÄìPersian War (1743‚Äì1746). Faced with a centuries-old rivalry and frequent conflicts between two mighty Islamic empires (Ottoman and Persian), all Christian communities in the bordering regions were constantly exposed to danger ‚Äì and not only in the times of war, since local, mainly Kurdish, warlords were accustomed to attacking Christian communities and monasteries. Patriarchs Eliya (X) XI (1700‚Äì1722) and Eliya (XI) XII (1722‚Äì1778) tried to improve the increasingly worsening position of their Christian flock by staying loyal to Ottoman authorities, but local the administration was frequently unable to provide effective protection. The Eliya line of traditionalist Patriarchs ended in 1804 with the death of Eliya (XII) XIII (1778‚Äì1804). =The junior Shimun line of Qochanis= During the second half of the 16th century, traditionalist patriarchs of the Eliya line were faced with the continuous presence of the pro-Catholic movement, led by successors of Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa. After his death in 1555, the newly established line of patriarchs who were united with the Catholic Church was continued by Abdisho IV Maron (1555‚Äì1570), who remained in full communion with the Catholic Church. He visited Rome and was officially confirmed by the Pope of Rome in 1562. Soon after his death, connections with Rome were weakened for the first time during the tenure of Patriarch Yahballaha IV who did not seek confirmation from the Pope. That interlude was ended by his successor Shimun IX Dinkha (1580‚Äì1600) who restored full communion with the Catholic Church, and was officially confirmed by the Pope in 1584. After his death, the patriarchal office was made hereditary, and Patriarchs of this line continued to use the name Shimun, thus creating the Shimun line. Hereditary succession was not acceptable to Rome, and during the tenure of the next Patriarch Shimun X Eliyah (1600‚Äì1638) ties with Catholic Church were loosened again. In 1616, Shimun X signed a traditional profession of faith that was not accepted by the Pope, leaving the Patriarch without Rome's confirmation. His successor Shimun XI Eshuyow (1638‚Äì1656) restored communion with the Catholic Church as late as 1653, eventually receiving confirmation from the Pope. By that time, movement towards full commitment to the traditional faith was constantly growing stronger within the Shimun line. When the next Patriarch Shimun XII Yoalaha decided to send his profession of faith to the Pope, he was deposed by his bishops because of his pro-Catholic attitude. The Pope tried to intervene on his behalf, but without success. Final resolution of conflicts within the Shimun line occurred under the next Patriarch Shimun XIII Dinkha (1662‚Äì1700), who definitively broke communion with the Catholic Church. In 1670, he gave a traditionalist reply to an approach that was made from the Pope, and by 1672 all connections with the Catholic Church were terminated. At the same time, Patriarch Shimun XIII moved his seat from Amid to Qochanis. After the final return to the traditional faith, Patriarchs of the Shimun line decided to keep their independence and after that time there were two independent lines of traditional patriarchs: the senior Eliya line in Alqosh and the junior Shimun line in Qochanis. Such division was additionally caused by the complex structure of local Assyrian communities, traditionally organized as tribal confederations with each tribe being headed by a local lord (malik), while each malik was ultimately subject to the patriarch, who mediated between Assyrian Christians and the Ottoman authorities. In spite of the prolonged rivalry between two patriarchal lines, they often faced similar problems and during the 18th century occasional cooperation was achieved, paving the way for the restoration of unity. =Consolidation of remaining branches= Mar Elias (Eliya), the Nestorian bishop of the Urmia Plain village of Geogtapa, c.1831. The image comes from A Residence of Eight Years in Persia Among the Nestorians, with Notes of the Mohammedans by Justin Perkins (Andover, 1843). In 1780, at the beginning of the patriarchal tenure of Eliya (XII) XIII (1778‚Äì1804), a group seceded from the Eliya line in Alqosh and elected Yohannan Hormizd, who entered full communion with the Catholic Church and was officially appointed Archbishop of Mosul and patriarchal administrator of the Chaldean Catholic Church, in 1783. Only after the death in 1827 of the last representative of the Josephite line, Joseph V Augustine Hindi, was Yohannan recognized as the Chaldean Catholic Patriarch by the Pope, in 1830. By this official appointment, the final merger of various factions committed to the union with the Catholic Church was achieved, thus forming the modern Chaldean Catholic Church. At the same time, the long coexistence and rivalry between two traditionalist patriarchal branches ‚Äî the senior Eliya line of Alqosh and the junior Shimun line of Qochanis ‚Äî ended in 1804 when the last primate of the Eliya line, Patriarch Eliya (XII) XIII died and was buried in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery. His branch decided not to elect a new patriarch, thus enabling the remaining patriarch Shimun XVI Yohannan (1780‚Äì1820) of the Shimun line to become the sole primate of both Assyrian traditionalist branches. Consolidated after 1804, the reunited traditionalist church led by patriarchs of the Shimun line became widely known as the \\"Assyrian Church of the East\\". Still based in Qodchanis, Assyrian Patriarch Shimun XVI Yohannan was not able to secure control over the traditional seat of the former Eliya line in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery; and around 1808 that venerated monastic institution passed to the Chaldean Catholics. The next Assyrian patriarch Shimun XVII Abraham (1820‚Äì1861) also led his Church from Qodshanis. During years marked by political turbulence, he tried to maintain good relations with the local Ottoman authorities. In 1843, he was faced with renewed hostilities from Kurdish warlords, who attacked and looted many Christian villages, killing 10,000 Christian men and taking away women and children as captives. The patriarch himself was forced to take temporary refuge in Mosul. He was succeeded by Patriarch Shimun XVIII Rubil (1861‚Äì1903) who also resided in Qodshanis. In 1869, he received an open invitation from the Vatican to visit Rome to attend the First Vatican Council as an observer, but he did not accept the invitation, In following years, he also rejected other initiatives for union with the Catholic Church.Early 20th century Assyrian archbishop and servants By the end of 19th century, the Assyrian Church of the East consolidated itself as the sole representative of all traditionalist Assyrians. It also managed to secure a certain level of autonomy within the highly complex system of Ottoman local governance in the bordering regions. On several occasions, Assyrian patriarchs refused to enter communion with the Catholic Church or merge with the Chaldean Catholic Church. On the other hand, by the end of 19th century some of its communities were converted to Protestantism by various western missionaries, while other communities were drawn to Eastern Orthodoxy. That movement was led by Assyrian bishop Mar Yonan of Supurghan in the region of Urmia, who converted to Eastern Orthodoxy in 1898, through the Russian Ecclesiastical Mission in Urmia. Activities of foreign missions among Assyrians represented not only a religious, but also a political challenge, since the Ottoman authorities were very suspicious of any foreign presence among their Christian subjects. =20th century= St. Mary Assyrian Church in Moscow. In spite of both ethnic and religious persecution and a serious decline in membership since their height around the fourth century, the Assyrian Church of the East has survived into the 21st century. Among all the tragedies and schisms which thinned the Church out, no other was as severe as the Assyrian genocide. At that point the Assyrian Church of the East was based in the mountains of Hakkari, as it had been since 1681. In 1915, The Young Turks invaded the region ‚Äî despite the Assyrians' plea of neutrality during the Caucasus Campaign by Russia and their Armenian allies ‚Äî out of fear of an Assyrian independence movement. In response to this, Assyrians of all denominations (the Assyrian Church of the East, the Chaldean Catholic Church, the Syriac Orthodox Church and Assyrian Protestants) entered into a war of independence and allied themselves with the United Kingdom, the Russian Empire and the Armenians against the Ottomans and their Islamic Kurdish, Iranian and Arab allies. Despite the odds, the Assyrians fought successfully against the Ottomans and their allies for three years throughout southeastern Turkey, northern Iraq, northwestern Iran and northeastern Syria. Eventually, however, they were abandoned by their allies, the Russian Empire and the First Republic of Armenia, due to the Russian Revolution and the collapse of the Armenian defense, leaving the Assyrians vastly outnumbered, surrounded, and cut off from supplies of ammunition and food. During this period, their see at Qodchanis was completely destroyed and the Turks and their Islamic allies massacred all of the Assyrians in the Hakkari Mountains. Those who survived fled into Iran with what remained of the Assyrian defense under Agha Petros, but they were pursued into Iranian territory despite the fact they were fleeing. Later, in 1918, after the murder of their de facto leader and patriarch Shimun XIX Benyamin and 150 of his followers during a negotiation, fearing further massacres at the hands of the Turks and Kurds, most of the survivors fled by train from Iran into what was to become Iraq. They sought protection under the British mandate there, and joined the already existing indigenous Assyrian communities of both Eastern Orthodox and Catholic rites in the north, where they formed communities in Baghdad, Basra, and other areas. Assyrians were some of the British Administration's most loyal subjects, so they employed Assyrian troops (\\"Iraq Levies\\") to put down Arab and Kurdish rebellions in the aftermath of World War I and to protect the Turkish and Iranian borders of British Iraq from invasion. In consequence, Assyrians of all Christian denominations endured persecution under the Hashemites, culminating in the Simele massacre in 1933, leading thousands to flee to the West, in particular to the United States. Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai himself went into exile in 1940‚Äì1941 and relocated the Patriarchate to Chicago which became the centre of the Assyrian‚ÄìChaldean‚ÄìSyriac diaspora. However, the Assyrians who remained continued to work alongside the British, even playing a major role in bringing down the pro-Nazi Iraqi forces during World War II, and they remained attached to British forces until 1955. Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai During this period, the British-educated patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai, born into the line of patriarchs at Qodchanis, agitated for an independent Assyrian state. Following the end of the British mandate in 1933 and a massacre of Assyrian civilians at Simele by the Iraqi Army, the patriarch was forced to take refuge in Cyprus. There, Shimun petitioned the League of Nations regarding his people's fate, but to little avail, and he was consequently barred from entering Syria and Iraq. He traveled through Europe before moving to Chicago in 1940 to join the growing Assyrian‚ÄìChaldean‚ÄìSyriac community there. Due to the church's and the general Assyrian community's disorganized state as a result of the conflicts of the 20th century, Patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai was forced to reorganize the church's structure in the United States. He transferred his residence to San Francisco in 1954, and was able to travel to Iran, Lebanon, Kuwait, and India, where he worked to strengthen the church. In 1964, the patriarch decreed a number of changes to the church, including liturgical reform, the adoption of the Gregorian calendar, and the shortening of Lent. These changes, combined with Shimun's long absence from Iraq, caused a rift in the community there, which led to another schism. In 1968, traditionalists within the church elected Thoma Darmo as a rival patriarch to Shimun XXI Eshai, forming the independent Ancient Church of the East, based in Baghdad, Iraq. In 1972, Shimun decided to step down as patriarch, and the following year he got married, in contravention to longstanding church custom. This led to a synod in 1973 in which further reforms were introduced, the most significant of which included the permanent abolition of hereditary succession ‚Äî a practice introduced in the middle of the fifteenth century by Patriarch Shem øon IV Basidi (who had died in 1497) ‚Äî and it was also decided that Shimun should be reinstated. The second matter was supposed to be settled at another synod in 1975; however, Shimun was assassinated by an estranged relative before this could take place. Patriarch Dinkha IV In 1976, Dinkha IV was elected as Shimun XXI Eshai's successor. The 33-year-old Dinkha had previously been Metropolitan of Tehran, and operated his see there until the Iran‚ÄìIraq War of 1980‚Äì1988. Thereafter, Dinkha IV went into exile in the United States and transferred the Patriarchal See to Chicago. Much of his patriarchate had been concerned with tending to the Assyrian‚ÄìChaldean‚ÄìSyriac diaspora community and with ecumenical efforts to strengthen relations with other churches. On 26 March 2015, Dinkha IV died in the United States, leaving the Assyrian Church of the East in a period of sede vacante until 18 September 2015. During that time, Aprem Mooken served as the custodian of the Patriarchate of Seleucia-Ctesiphon. Patriarch Gewargis III On 18 September 2015, the Holy Synod of the Assyrian Church of the East elected the Metropolitan of Iraq, Jordan, and Russia, Warda Sliwa, to succeed the late Dinkha IV as Catholicos-Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East. On 27 September 2015, he was consecrated as Catholicos-Patriarch in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Baptist, in Erbil, Iraq. Upon his consecration, he assumed the ecclesiastical name Gewargis III. Church leaders have proposed moving the Patriarchal See from Chicago back to Erbil. There have also been talks of reunification. In the Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East in 1994, the two Churches recognized the legitimacy and rightness of each other's titles for Mary. In 2010, the Assyrian Church of the East had about 170,000 members, mostly living in the United States, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. Doctrine Theologically, the Assyrian Church of the East still adheres to the Church of the East's traditional Christology, that is often labeled as Nestorian. The use and exact meaning of that term has been the subject of many debates‚Äînot only throughout history but also in modern times‚Äîsince the Assyrian Church of the East has distinctive views on several christological questions and claims that its theological doctrines and traditions are essentially orthodox, while admitting the need for further inter-Christian dialog that would resolve various questions in the field of comparative christological terminology. Unlike most other churches that trace their origins to antiquity, the modern Assyrian Church of the East is not in communion with any other church. The Nestorian nature of Assyrian Christianity remains a matter of contention. Elements of the Nestorian doctrine were explicitly repudiated by Patriarch Dinkha IV on the occasion of his accession in 1976. The Christology of the Church of the East has its roots in the Antiochene theological tradition of the early Church. The founders of Assyrian theology are Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia, both of whom taught at Antioch. \\"Antiochene\\" is a modern designation given to the style of theology associated with the early Church at Antioch, as contrasted with the theology of the Church of Alexandria. Antiochene theology emphasizes Christ's humanity and the reality of the moral choices he faced. In order to preserve the impassibility of Christ's Divine Nature, the unity of His person is defined in a looser fashion than in the Alexandrian tradition. The normative Christology of the Assyrian church was written by Babai the Great (551‚Äì628) during the controversy that followed the 431 Council of Ephesus. Babai held that within Christ there exist two qn√¥m√¢ (‹©‹¢‹ò‹°‹ê) (Syriac equivalent for Greek term hypostasis), unmingled, but everlastingly united in the one prosopon (personality) of Christ. The precise Christological teachings of Nestorius are shrouded in obscurity. Wary of monophysitism, Nestorius rejected Cyril's theory of a hypostatic union, proposing instead a union of will. Nestorianism has come to mean radical dyophysitism, in which Christ's two natures are eternally separate, though it is doubtful whether Nestorius ever taught such a doctrine. Nestorius' rejection of the term Theotokos ('God-bearer', or 'Mother of God') has traditionally been held as evidence that he asserted the existence of two persons ‚Äî not merely two natures ‚Äî in Jesus Christ, but there exists no evidence that Nestorius denied Christ's oneness. In the controversy that followed the Council of Ephesus, the term \\"Nestorian\\" was applied to all doctrine upholding a strictly Antiochene Christology. In consequence, the Church of the East was labelled Nestorian, though its theology is not radically dyophysite. Liturgy The church employs the Syriac dialect of Eastern Aramaic in its liturgy, the East Syrian Rite, which includes three anaphoras, attributed to Thaddeus (Addai) and Mari, Theodore of Mopsuestia and later also Nestorius.  Iconography  In their homes, Christians belonging to the Assyrian Church of the East hang a Christian Cross (without the corpus) on the eastern wall of the main room. The Assyrian Church of the East does not currently make use of icons and the interior of its houses of worship are simple. Iconography has been present in the Church of the East's history; opposition to religious images eventually became the norm due to the rise of Islam in the region, which forbade any type of depictions of saints and biblical prophets. As such, the church was forced to get rid of her icons. A Nestorian Peshitta Gospel book written in Estrangela, from the 13th century, currently resided at the State Library of Berlin. This illustrated manuscript from northern Mesopotamia or Tur Abdin proves that in the 13th century the church was not yet aniconic. Another Nestorian Gospel manuscript preserved in the Biblioth√®que nationale de France, which contains an illustration that depicts Jesus Christ (not a crucifix) in the circle of a ringed cross (in the form of celtic cross) surrounded by four angels. Three Syriac manuscripts from early 19th century and earlier‚Äîthey were edited into a compilation titled The Book of Protection by Hermann Gollancz‚Äîcontaining a number of illustrations which are more or less crude. These manuscripts prove the continuous use of images. Moreover, a life-size male stucco figure was discovered in a church of Seleucia-Ctesiphon from the late 6th century. Beneath this church were found the remains of an earlier church. Although it cannot be determined which Nestorian Church was involved, the discovery nevertheless proves that the Church of the East also used figurative representations.

Organization The Assyrian Church of the East is governed by an episcopal polity, the same as other apostolic churches. The church maintains a system of geographical parishes organized into dioceses and archdioceses. The Catholicos-Patriarch is the head of the church. Its synod is composed of bishops who oversee individual dioceses and metropolitans who oversee episcopal dioceses in their territorial jurisdiction. The Chaldean Syrian Church, which encompasses India and the Persian Gulf, is the largest diocese of the church. Its history goes back to the Church of the East that established a presence in Kerala, but the two communities maintained only a sporadic connection for several centuries, and consistent relations were only established with the arrival of the Portuguese in India around 1500. The church is represented by the Assyrian Church of the East and is in communion with it. Membership is estimated to 170,000,\\"Nestorian\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved April 19, 2010. although some sources say as high as 500,000 =Hierarchy= The patriarchal seat was moved several times throughout history. Up to the 1804, patriarchs of the senior Eliya line resided in the ancient Rabban Hormizd Monastery, while patriarchs of the junior Shimun line resided in the Cathedral Church of Mar Shallita, in the village of Qudshanis in the Hakkari Mountains of the Ottoman Empire, and continued to do so up to the First World War. After the beginning of conflict in 1915, the patriarchs temporarily resided between Urmia and Salmas, and after 1918 the patriarchs resided in Mosul. After the Simele Massacre of 1933, the then patriarch Shimun XXI Eshai was exiled to Cyprus due to his agitation for independence. In 1940 he was welcomed to the United States where he set up his residence in Chicago, and administered the United States and Canada as his patriarchal province. The patriarchate was then moved to Modesto, California in 1954, and finally to San Francisco in 1958 due to health issues. After the assassination of the patriarch and the election of Dinkha IV in 1976, the patriarchate was temporarily located in Tehran, where the new patriarch was living at the time. After the Iran‚ÄìIraq War and the Iranian Revolution, the patriarchate again returned to Chicago, where it remained until 2015, when it reestablished itself in the Middle East by organizing in Erbil's Ankawa district in Iraq after Gewargis III was installed as Catholicos-Patriarch. The Diocese of Eastern United States served as the patriarch's province from 1994 until 2012. Due to the unstable political, religious and economic situation in the church's historical homeland of the Middle East, many of the church members now reside in Western countries. Churches and dioceses have been established throughout Europe, America, and Oceania. The largest expatriate concentration of church members is in the United States, mainly situated in Illinois and California. =Archdioceses= # Archdiosese of India Chaldean Syrian Church ‚Äì remains in communion and is the biggest province of the church with close to 30 active churches, primary and secondary schools, hospitals etc. # Archdiocese of Iraq ‚Äì covers the indigenous territory of the church in Iraq.

Retired : * Sargis Yosip: Bishop Emeritus of Baghdad (residing in Modesto, California) Ecumenical relations Pope John XXIII invited many other Christian denominations, including the Assyrian Church of the East, to send \\"observers\\" to the Second Vatican Council (1962‚Äì1965). These observers, graciously received and seated as honored guests right in front of the podium on the floor of the council chamber, did not participate in the council's debate, but they mingled freely with the Catholic bishops and theologians who constituted the council, and with the other observers as well, in the break area during the council sessions. There, cordial conversations began a rapprochement that has blossomed into expanding relations among the Catholic Church, the churches of the Orthodox Communion, and the ancient Churches of the East. On November 11, 1994, a historic meeting between Patriarch Dinkha IV and Pope John Paul II took place in Rome. The two patriarchs signed a document titled \\"Common Christological Declaration Between the Catholic Church and the Assyrian Church of the East\\". One side effect of this meeting was that the Assyrian Church's relationship with the fellow Chaldean Catholic Church began to improve. In 1996, Patriarch Dinkha IV signed an agreement of cooperation with the Chaldean Catholic Church Patriarch of Baghdad, Raphael I Bidawid, in Southfield, Michigan, Bidawid himself being keen to heal theological divisions among Assyrians of all denominations. In 1997, he entered into negotiations with the Syriac Orthodox Church and the two churches ceased anathematizing each other. The lack of a coherent institution narrative in the Anaphora of Addai and Mari, which dates to apostolic times, has caused many Western Christians, and especially Roman Catholics, to doubt the validity of this anaphora, used extensively by the Assyrian Church of the East, as a prayer of consecration of the eucharistic elements. In 2001, after a study of this issue, Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI), then Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, promulgated a declaration approved by Pope John Paul II stating that this is a valid anaphora. This declaration opened the door to a joint synodal decree officially implementing the present Guidelines for Admission to the Eucharist between the Chaldean Church and the Assyrian Church of the East, which the synods of the Assyrian Church of the East and the Chaldean Catholic Church signed and promulgated on 20 July 2001. This joint synodal decree provided that: # Assyrian faithful may participate and receive Holy Communion in a Chaldean celebration of the Holy Eucharist # Chaldean catholic faithful may participate and receive Holy Communion in an Assyrian Church celebration of the Holy Eucharist, even if celebrated using the Anaphora of Addai and Mari in its original form # Assyrian clergy are invited (but not obliged) to insert the institution narrative into the Anaphora of Addai and Mari when Chaldean faithful are present. The joint synodal decree identified several issues that require resolution to permit a relationship of full communion, though from an ecumenical perspective it marks a major step toward full collaboration in the pastoral care of their members.

In more mathematical or scientific terms, it is a measure of the extent to which input is well used for an intended task or function (output). It often specifically comprises the capability of a specific application of effort to produce a specific outcome with a minimum amount or quantity of waste, expense, or unnecessary effort. Sickles, R., and Zelenyuk, V. (2019). Measurement of Productivity and Efficiency: Theory and Practice. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/9781139565981 Efficiency refers to very different inputs and outputs in different fields and industries. Efficiency is very often confused with effectiveness. In general, efficiency is a measurable concept, quantitatively determined by the ratio of useful output to total input. Effectiveness is the simpler concept of being able to achieve a desired result, which can be expressed quantitatively but does not usually require more complicated mathematics than addition. Efficiency can often be expressed as a percentage of the result that could ideally be expected, for example if no energy were lost due to friction or other causes, in which case 100% of fuel or other input would be used to produce the desired result. In some cases efficiency can be indirectly quantified with a non-percentage value, e.g. specific impulse. A common but confusing way of distinguishing between efficiency and effectiveness is the saying \\"Efficiency is doing things right, while effectiveness is doing the right things.\\" This saying indirectly emphasizes that the selection of objectives of a production process is just as important as the quality of that process. This saying popular in business however obscures the more common sense of \\"effectiveness\\", which would/should produce the following mnemonic: \\"Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is getting things done.\\" This makes it clear that effectiveness, for example large production numbers, can also be achieved through inefficient processes if, for example, workers are willing or used to working longer hours or with greater physical effort than in other companies or countries or if they can be forced to do so. Similarly, a company can achieve effectiveness, for example large production numbers, through inefficient processes if it can afford to use more energy per product, for example if energy prices or labor costs or both are lower than for its competitors. Efficiency is often measured as the ratio of useful output to total input, which can be expressed with the mathematical formula r=P/C, where P is the amount of useful output (\\"product\\") produced per the amount C (\\"cost\\") of resources consumed. This may correspond to a percentage if products and consumables are quantified in compatible units, and if consumables are transformed into products via a conservative process. For example, in the analysis of the energy conversion efficiency of heat engines in thermodynamics, the product P may be the amount of useful work output, while the consumable C is the amount of high-temperature heat input. Due to the conservation of energy, P can never be greater than C, and so the efficiency r is never greater than 100% (and in fact must be even less at finite temperatures).

The total length of the river is .Britannica River Tamar, United Kingdom At its mouth, the Tamar flows into the Hamoaze before entering Plymouth Sound, a bay of the English Channel. Tributaries of the river include the rivers Inny, Ottery, Kensey and Lynher (or St Germans River) on the Cornish side, and the Deer and Tavy on the Devon side. The name Tamar (or Tamare) was mentioned by Ptolemy in the second century in his Geography. The name is said to mean \\"Great Water.\\"Furneaux, Robert. The Tamar: A Great Little River. Ex Libris Press. 1992.Foot, Sarah. The River Tamar. Bossiney Books. 1989.Neale, John. Discovering the River Tamar. Amberley. 2010. The Tamar is one of several British rivers whose ancient name is assumed by some to be derived from a prehistoric river word apparently meaning \\"dark flowing\\" and which it shares with the River Thames. The seventh century Ravenna Cosmography mentions a Roman settlement named Tamaris, but it is unclear to which of those towns along the Tamar this refers. Plymouth, Launceston, and the Roman fort at Calstock have been variously suggested.  Environment  The river (and/or land on its banks) is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a European Special Area of Conservation, and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.http://www.tamarproject.org.uk/about-the-river-tamar-project/ It is also designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site as part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. In November 2013, South West Water was fined ¬£50,000 after it admitted permitting the discharge of sewage from its Camels Head treatment plant into a tributary of the River Tamar for eight years. = Tamar Valley AONB = Together, the Tamar, Tavy and Lynher form the Tamar Valley, a designated Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The Tamar Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty covers around around the lower Tamar (below Launceston) and its tributaries the Tavy and the Lynher. It was first proposed in 1963, but was not designated until 1995. The highest point in the AONB is Kit Hill, 334 metres above sea level. = European Special Area of Conservation = The tidal river, between Cotehele Quay and Weir Quay, with its mudbanks and reed beds. The Plymouth Sound and Estuaries are a European Special Area of Conservation. Rocky reefs in low salinity estuarine conditions far inland on the Tamar are very unusual and support species such as the hydroid Cordylophora caspia. The Tamar is one of a few estuaries where zonation of rocky habitats (intertidal and subtidal) can be observed along an estuarine gradient. = Site of Special Scientific Interest = The Tamar‚ÄìTavy Estuary is a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) covering the tidal estuaries of the River Tamar and the River Tavy. Part of the Tamar estuary also forms the Tamar Estuary Nature Reserve, owned by the Cornwall Wildlife Trust. The site was designated in 1991 for its biodiversity and varying habitats that support a large number of wader and wildfowl species, as well as the special interest of its marine biology. The site supports a nationally important wintering population of avocet and supports species such as black- tailed godwit, Eurasian whimbrel, greenshank, spotted redshank, green sandpiper and golden plover. = UNESCO World Heritage Site = Throughout human history the valley has been almost continuously exploited for its rich mineral and metal deposits including silver, tin, lead and arsenic leaving a unique archaeological landscape which forms a significant part of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. Remains include wheal or engine houses, deep and open cast mines dating from the Bronze Age through to the medieval and modern era, the export docks at Morwellham Quay were once an international centre of trade in copper, lead and arsenic. The valley, with the stannary town of Tavistock was added to the World Heritage List during the 30th Session of the UNESCO World Heritage Committee in Vilnius, July 2006.  Geography  The dam of the Upper Tamar Lake. = Sources = The most northerly bridge over the river According to Ordnance Survey mapping, the source of the Tamar is at Woolley Moor, approximately 3.5 miles from the north Cornish coast, at .marked \\"Spring\\" on Ordnance Survey 25-inch \\"Devon XXXVIII.3\\", published 1905 The location of the spring is a \\"high windswept plateau largely devoid of farmland, and inhabited by stunted trees and wiry undergrowth.\\" The exact source of the river is difficult to pinpoint, because it arises \\"from a boggy morass . . . behind a hedge near some willow trees at Woolley Barrows . . . A small square stone culvert drains the first tentative trickle of water away from the bog, through a hedge and into a ditch. From here a pipe carries the water under the highway and the infant river Tamar is on its way to the sea at Plymouth.\\" = Reservoirs = The Upper Tamar Lake and Lower Tamar Lake are two small reservoirs on the Tamar's upper course. The Lower Lake was constructed in the 1820s to feed the Bude Canal; it is now a nature reserve. The Upper Lake was constructed in the 1970s and supplies fresh water to the Bude area, as well as having some recreational use. = Border = The east bank of the Tamar was fixed as the border of Cornwall by King Athelstan in the year 936.Stenton, F. M. (1947) Anglo-Saxon England. Oxford: Clarendon Press; p. 337 Several villages north of Launceston, to the west of the Tamar, were transferred to Devon somewhen in the eleventh century; the border was changed to follow the River Ottery westward, rather than the Tamar. The county boundary was restored to the Tamar in 1966, when the civil parishes of North Petherwin and Werrington were transferred from Devon to Cornwall. The Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844 ensured parishes were entirely within one county. It transferred a part of the Rame Peninsula (on the west side of the Hamoaze) from Devon to Cornwall (namely, parts of the parishes of Maker and St John). The Act also transferred part of the parish of Bridgerule to Devon and part of the parish of North Tamerton to Cornwall ‚Äî these latter transfers created two of the present-day 'exceptions' to the river boundary. The modern administrative border between Devon and Cornwall more closely follows the Tamar and Hamoaze than the 'historic' county border (of the 11th to 19th centuries). Only three 'exceptions' to the rule that the border follows the river (from source to sea) currently exist, all of which are upstream of the confluence of the River Deer, in the upper course of the Tamar.The three present-day 'exceptions' can be clearly seen on the Tamar catchment map (on WikiCommons). Part of the Cornish civil parish of North Tamerton extends east across the river, whilst parts of the Devon civil parishes of Bridgerule and Pancrasweek extend west across the Tamar. Where the border does follow the Tamar, it is defined as being along a line running at the centre of the river ‚Äî where the river is tidal, it is the centre of the low water channel. This \\"centre of river\\" arrangement ends just upstream of the Tamar Bridge at Saltash, downstream of which the counties officially extend only to their respective (tidal) bank's low water mark. The river is dammed at two points of its upper course, forming two reservoirs in place of the natural river: at Upper Tamar Lake the border follows the line of the river as it was prior to the construction of the reservoir (therefore now within the lake), whilst at the older Lower Tamar Lake the border was re-aligned along a (now disused) re- routing of the river to the reservoir's west side, placing the lake in Devon.Ordnance Survey mapping = Crossings = Higher New Bridge, near St Stephen by Launceston The river has 22 road crossings, including some medieval stone bridges. The oldest bridge still extant is at Horsebridge (1437), and the next oldest is Greystone Bridge near Lawhitton ‚Äî this arched stone bridge was built in 1439. Gunnislake New Bridge was built in 1520 by Sir Piers Edgcumbe, the owner of Cotehele and Mount Edgcumbe. The Gunnislake bridge was a main route into south east Cornwall and the lowest bridge over the Tamar until the Tamar Bridge at Saltash was opened in 1962. The lower Tamar is spanned also by the Royal Albert Bridge (built 1859), a rail bridge now adjacent to the newer Tamar Bridge. Both of these bridges are between Saltash (known as the 'Gateway to Cornwall') and Plymouth. Further downstream, crossing the Hamoaze, is the Torpoint Ferry ‚Äî a chain ferry connecting Torpoint to Devonport ‚Äî and at the most downstream part of the Hamoaze there is also the Cremyll Ferry. The Calstock Viaduct is another notable structure on the Tamar, being 120 feet (37 m) high with twelve 60-foot (18 m) wide arches, of which three of the piers stand in the river, and was built between 1904 and 1907.  Table of crossings  Listed below are all crossings of the River Tamar, in order heading downstream.

The total length of the tidal river (which, like other tidal waters in England, has public right of navigation) is .Inland Waterways Association Waterways: T (note: the tidal river is generally regarded as navigable from Plymouth Sound to Weir Head, a length of 19.0 miles.) The normal tidal limit (noted on Ordnance Survey maps as 'NTL') is a weir just downstream of the village of Gunnislake. Waterborne traffic through the Hamoaze is controlled by the Queen's Harbour Master for Plymouth, who is responsible for managing navigation along the entire tidal Tamar. The Royal Navy has one of its three main naval bases at Devonport, situated on the Hamoaze, upstream of which the river is now used largely by recreational craft. Excursions operate (April to October only) on the river between Plymouth and Calstock; excursions used to operate as far as Morwellham Quay, but were suspended indefinitely in 2016. A passenger ferry also operates April to October between Cotehele Quay and Calstock. A typical Tamar vessel was a sailing barge, built on the open river bank, of up to 60 tons, with a peaked, gaff-rigged mainsail and a fore staysail.Booker (1971: 259) The Tamar was navigable by seagoing ships of up to 400 register tons as far inland as Weir Quay,Booker (1971: 62) near Bere Alston, where the estuary narrows into the tidal river, some upstream from Plymouth Sound. Vessels of 300 tons sailed as far inland as Morwellham,Barton (1964: 75‚Äì6) along the river from the sea. A further stretch of upstream to Weir Head, near Gunnislake, was accessible to smaller boats. Weir Head is just downstream of the weir at Gunnislake (the tidal limit) and is the final place to turn boats; it was from here that smaller craft could begin their journey on the Tamar Manure Canal. = Tamar Manure Navigation = gross tons, 126 feet in length, reversing at the entrance to the Tamar Manure Canal, in 1906. In 1794 the Tamar Manure Navigation Company was formed to extend navigation inland for a further 30 miles, to Tamerton Bridge in North Tamerton. An Act of Parliament of 1796 authorised the works, with the company empowered to improve and manage navigation on the Tamar from Morwellham Quay upstream to Boat Pool, at Blanchdown (just upstream of Gunnislake), and to construct a canal from there.Tamar Valley Industrial Archaeology Tamar Manure Canal The project however advanced no further than Gunnislake, with work ceasing in 1808. Barges of up to 30 tons could then proceed as far as Gunnislake New Bridge,Booker (1971: 126‚Äì128) bypassing the weir (above Weir Head) via a 500-yard canal to the west of the river. As the only completed work of the original project, this short canal became known as the Tamar Manure (Navigation) Canal. It had one lock located at the Weir Head end of the canal, allowing vessels to rise from the tidal Tamar to the water level above the weir.Canal Routes ‚Äì Tamar Manure Navigation A salmon ladder bypassed the lock. The navigable route along the Tamar and the Manure Canal that was managed by the company (from Morwellham Quay upstream to Blanchdown) was known as the Tamar Manure Navigation and was in length. The import of fertilizer (at the time of the construction of the canal all types of which were typically referred to as \\"manure\\") and coal and the export of bricks and granite along this short navigation proved profitable for many years. The navigation from Launceston to Tamerton was completed in 1826 as part of a separate project, the Bude Canal.Otter (1994: 29) The Tamar Manure Navigation ceased functioning in 1929 and the company was wound up in 1942.  History  In 997 according to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, raiding Vikings travelled up the Tamar and then the Tavy river as far as Lydford, and burned Ordwulf's monastery at Tavistock. The old ferry crossings were later to develop into the busy river quays of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In mediaeval times the transport of goods to supply the Benedictine abbey at Tavistock, four miles by track from the river port of Morwellham, was significant.Booker (1971: 28‚Äì29) Sea sand from the coast was imported to spread on farmland, until in the eighteenth century a dressing of lime was found to be more beneficial. Large quantities of limestone and coal were then imported to burn in the numerous limekilns on the river quays; the lime had to be made locally as it was not slaked before application and was too reactive for transport by water after burning. Later, street sweepings and other refuse from Plymouth and Devonport, together with bones for the newly discovered bone fertiliser, were carried inland to manure the fields. Other regular imports were timber from British Columbia and the Baltic, in large baulks for use as supports in the mines, and coal from Wales to supply the mine pumping engines.Barton (1964: 65; 76) The Horsebridge, built in 1437, is still used by motor traffic. Tavistock was one of the three stannary towns of Devon and large quantities of refined tin ore were exported through Morwellham from twelfth century until 1838, when the requirement to pay duty on the metal at one of the specified towns was relaxed. The opening of the Tavistock Canal, between Tavistock and Morwellham, in 1817 facilitated traffic. Later, the East Cornwall Mineral Railway provided an outlet through the quays of Calstock from the Cornish side of the valley.Booker (1971: 178) Other significant cargoes exported were quarried granite and, later, copper, lead and manganese ores, with their important by-product of arsenic. Arsenic was extracted from mispickel, once regarded as a waste product but later offering an important source of revenue as copper and tin extraction declined in profitability.Booker (1971: 162) The refined product was exported worldwide, in particular to the southern United States, where it was used as an insecticide in the cotton fields. In the thirteenth century lead and silver output from the royal mines on the Bere peninsula (between the Tamar and the Tavy) was significant, and production continued intermittently until the nineteenth century. The Johnson Matthey smelting works at Weir Quay extracted silver and lead not only from local ore, but from ore imported by sea from Europe and as far away as Newfoundland. Fluorspar from the lead mine tailings was exported to France for use in the manufacture of glassware.Barton (1964: 100) The Tamar Valley Line railway crosses the Tamar on a viaduct, built in 1907, at Calstock. The development of the \\"Three Towns\\" (Plymouth, Devonport and Stonehouse) at the mouth of the river offered an important market for the valley's agricultural produce, needed in particular to serve the victualling requirements of the royal dockyard, and this was always carried by boat. In 1820 or 1821 the first paddle steamer on the Tamar inaugurated a service between Calstock and Devonport to deliver foodstuffs. In 1859 a rail connection from Plymouth to London was opened, and fresh produce could be landed at the Devonport steamer quays in the evening and be on sale in London by the next morning.Booker (1971: 233) The growing city population created a large demand for sightseeing cruises on the river and this was a significant source of traffic from 1823, with the launch of the Cornish steam packet Sir Francis Drake, until the outbreak of the second world war.Booker (1971: 83‚Äì84)Kitteridge (1984: 13; 75) Mineral traffic on the river diminished towards the latter end of the nineteenth century, after the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway reached Tavistock in 1859 (so making the Tavistock Canal to Morwellham redundant for transport, although it remains in use as a source of hydropower) and as the copper and tin mines became exhausted.Booker (1971: 30‚Äì31) The decline accelerated from 1894 when the East Cornwall Mineral Railway, until then linked to the outside world only through the port of Calstock, was extended to the Plymouth, Devonport and South Western Junction Railway at Bere Alston. Tourist and market traffic on the river, using purpose-built or converted steamers, remained substantial until the Devonport piers were closed and the ships requisitioned on the outbreak of war in 1939.  Economy  The Royal Albert Bridge and the Tamar Bridge at Saltash. Rocks around the edge of Dartmoor were mineralised by fluids driven by the heat of the earth's core, which gave rise to ores containing tin, copper, tungsten, lead and other minerals in the Valley. The medieval estate of Cotehele, owned by the Edgcumbe family, was a significant producer of silver for the Royal Mint.Peter Claughton: The medieval silver mines at Bere Ferrers, Devon, Dept. of History, Exeter University During the industrial revolution, there was significant mining activity near the river, between Gunnislake and Weir Quay. During this period, the Tamar was an important river for shipping copper from ports such as Morwellham Quay, Calstock and New Quay (Devon) to south Wales where it would be smelted. The valley forms district A10i of the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape. The river has long been famous for the quality of its salmonNoted by Daniel Defoe and Sir Richard Carew whilst the valley was known nationally for the high quality, and early, soft fruit and market gardens sheltered by its steeply winding slopes.  Folklore  The Alliterative Morte Arthure states that the mortal combat of King Arthur and Mordred took place close to the banks of the river.The Death of King Arthur translated by Simon Armitage A traditional Cornish tale claims that the devil would never dare to cross the River Tamar into Cornwall for fear of ending up as a pasty filling. Though unusual landscape features are often named after the devil (e.g. devil's frying pan) it used to be said that the devil never came to Cornwall: he once reached Torpoint and immediately noticed that various kinds of pie were customary; he feared that devilly pie might be the next kind so returned to Devon.Croxford, Bob (1993) From Cornwall with Love. Mullion: Atmosphere; p. 8 (text quoted from Robert Hunt's Popular Romances of the West of England, 1865)Canner, A. C. (1982) The Parish of Tintagel. Camelford; p. 54 This legend is set to music in the traditional Cornish folk song Fish and Tin and Copper. = Legend of Tamara = The legend behind the name involves a nymph by the name of Tamara, who lived in the underworld. Tamara wanted to wander freely in the mortal world, against the advice of her parents. One day, wandering in Dartmoor, she happened to meet two giants called Tavy and Torridge (or Tawradge). Both giants became smitten with Tamara and vied for her affections. Tamara led the giants on a dance, but never let them touch her, instead darting out of reach whenever they came too close. Tamara's father, who had been out looking for her, located her just as the giants finally caught up with her near Morwenstow. He flew into a rage and used a spell to put Tavy and Tawradge into a deep sleep. This infuriated Tamara, who subsequently refused to return to the underworld with her father. He became even more enraged and cast a spell on Tamara, turning her into a bubbling spring, which produced the Tamar river and flowed all the way to the sea. Tawradge awoke to find his beloved had become a river; in despair, he sought the advice of a magician, who turned him into a river (the River Torridge and the River Taw) so that he could hope to reunite with Tamara. Tawradge was never able to find and merge with his beloved Tamara, instead turning north toward Bideford and the Bristol Channel and is still said to mourn his love, the Tamar. This legend explains why the River Torridge, which rises only 500 meters from the Tamar, veers away from the Tamar and forms a huge arc, eventually flowing to the North Devon coast. The other giant, Tavy, also awoke in despair and sought the aid of his own father, also a powerful magician. His father turned Tavy into a river as well, and the Tavy set off in search of the Tamar, eventually finding her and merging with her into a wide and beautiful estuary.

Methoxides are organic salts and the simplest alkoxides. Sodium methoxide and potassium methoxide have widespread use, though other metal-cation variants such as lithium methoxide, rubidium methoxide, and caesium methoxide exist as well.  Methoxide ion  The methoxide ion has the formula of CH3O‚àí and is the conjugate base of methanol. It is a strong organic base, even stronger than the inorganic hydroxide ion. As such, methoxide solutions must be kept free of water; otherwise, the methoxide will remove a proton from a water molecule, yielding methanol and hydroxide.  Sodium methoxide  Sodium methoxide, also called sodium methylate and sodium methanolate, is a white powder when pure. It is used as an initiator of an anionic addition polymerization with ethylene oxide, forming a polyether with high molecular weight. Both sodium methoxide and its counterpart prepared with potassium are frequently used as catalysts for commercial-scale production of biodiesel. In this process, vegetable oils or animal fats, which chemically are fatty acid triglycerides, are transesterified with methanol to give fatty acid methyl esters (FAMEs).

Life He was born in Galway, the only son of John Croker, the surveyor-general of customs and excise in Ireland. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin, where he graduated in 1800. Immediately afterwards he entered Lincoln's Inn, and in 1802 he was called to the Irish bar. He married Rosamond Pennell (daughter of William Pennell & Elizabeth Pennell (n√©e Carrington)) on May 22, 1806 in Waterford, Ireland. None of his children with Rosamond Pennell survived past 3 years old. He and Rosamond adopted Rosamond's younger sister (who was the 18th child of Rosamond's parents) and she was also (confusingly) named Rosamond Hester Elizabeth Pennell. The younger Rosamond was born in January 1810 in Waterford, Ireland (christened with the surname Pennell). Sometime between birth and 1814 she became part of the Croker family. The name she was better known by was the nickname \\"Nony\\" Croker. Nony's portrait by Sir Thomas Lawrence (commissioned by John Croker) is in the collection of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, New York. His interest in the French Revolution led him to collect a large number of valuable documents on the subject, which are now in the British Museum. In 1804 he published anonymously Familiar Epistles to J. F. Jones, Esquire, on the State of the Irish Stage, a series of caustic criticisms in verse on the management of the Dublin theatres. The book ran through five editions in one year. Equally successful was the Intercepted Letter from Canton (1805), also anonymous, a satire on Dublin society in the guise of a report on the manners of the Chinese at Quang-tchen on the \\"Li-fee\\". During this period a rather scathing poem attributed to Croker led to the suicide of actor John Edwin, husband of Elizabeth Rebecca Edwin. In 1807 he published a pamphlet on The State of Ireland, Past and Present, in which he advocated Catholic emancipation. He was a distant relation of Thomas Crofton Croker, Irish writer and antiquarian, who served under him in the Admiralty. Parliamentary career The following year (1808) Croker entered parliament as member for Downpatrick, obtaining the seat on petition, though he had been unsuccessful at the poll. The acumen displayed in his Irish pamphlet led Spencer Perceval to recommend him to the Duke of Wellington, who had just been appointed to the command of British forces in the Iberian Peninsula, as his deputy in the office of chief secretary for Ireland. This connection led to a friendship which remained unbroken till Wellington's death. The notorious case of the Duke of York in connexion with his abuse of military patronage furnished Croker with an opportunity for distinguishing himself. The speech which he delivered on 14 March 1809, in answer to the charges of Colonel Wardle, was regarded as able; and Croker was appointed to the office of first secretary to the Admiralty, which he held without interruption under various administrations for more than twenty years. Among the first acts of his official career was the exposure of George Villiers, a fellow-official who had misappropriated the public funds to the extent of ¬£280,000; Villiers was well regarded at court, and action was taken against him only after Croker threatened resignation. It was soon noted by a First Lord that although Croker described himself as the servant of the Board, in reality the reverse was true. The second secretary to the Admiralty John Barrow became a close personal friend, and Barrow' eldest son married Croker's adopted daughter (a niece of Croker's) In 1816 he reduced the size of the Royal Navy, and over 1,000 ships were decommissioned and placed in the Reserve Fleet (United Kingdom) or \\"laid up in ordinary\\" at various British naval bases. In 1824 he helped found the Athenaeum Club, and when the members voted ¬£2000 for an icehouse, instead he commissioned from sculptor John Henning a full-scale replica in Bath stone of sculptures from the Parthenon, occasioning the widely circulated squib \\"I'm John Wilson Croker, I do as I please. They ask for an Ice House, I give them‚Äî a Frieze\\". In 1827 he became the Member of Parliament for Dublin University, having previously sat successively for the boroughs of Athlone, Yarmouth, Bodmin and Aldeburgh. He was made a Privy Councillor in June 1828 and, having secured a pension of ¬£1500 a year, retired from his post at the admiralty in 1830. He was a determined opponent of the Reform Bill, and vowed that he would never sit in a reformed parliament; he left parliament when the Act was passed in 1832. Many of his political speeches were published in pamphlet form, and they show him to have been a vigorous and effective, though somewhat unscrupulous and often virulently personal, party debater. Yet he could on occasion be magnanimous to his opponents: when Lord Althorp during a debate in the Commons, said that while he had figures which refuted Croker's argument he had mislaid them, Croker replied that he would never doubt Althorp's word. Croker had been an ardent supporter of Robert Peel, but finally broke with him when he began to advocate the repeal of the Corn Laws. Literary career Croker was for many years one of the leading contributors on literary and historical subjects to the Quarterly Review, with which he had been associated from its foundation. The rancorous spirit in which many of his articles were written did much to embitter party feeling. It also reacted unfavourably on Croker's reputation as a worker in the department of pure literature by bringing political animosities into literary criticism. He had no sympathy with the younger school of poets who were in revolt against the artificial methods of the 18th century. In April 1833 he savagely criticised Poems, published the previous December by Alfred Tennyson‚Äîan attack which, coupled with the death of his friend Arthur Hallam, discouraged the aspiring poet from seeking to publish anything more for nine years.Milgate, Michael, 1963, Tennyson, Oxford University Press, page 9 He was also responsible for the famous Quarterly article on John Keats's Endymion. Shelley and Byron blamed this article for bringing about the death of the poet, 'snuffed out', in Byron's phrase, 'by an article' (they, however, attributed the article to William Gifford). His magnum opus, an edition of Boswell's Life of Johnson (1831) was the subject of an unfavourable reviewMacaulay's Review of Croker's Boswell by Macaulay in the Edinburgh Review (a Whig rival/opponent of the Quarterly Review) The main grounds of criticism were echoed by Thomas Carlyle in a less famous review in Fraser's Magazine, issue 28; quote from version in Carlyle \\"English and Other Critical Essays\\" (Dent & Sons, London, 1915) (\\"no 704 of Everyman's Library\\") *that Croker had added extensive notes which were to little point, being superfluous or declaring Croker's inability to grasp Johnson's point on matters where the reviewers had no difficulty. Macaulay also complained (with numerous examples) of factual errors in the notes; Carlyle of their carping attitude to Johnson's motives (Carlyle, whose father was a stonemason, and who (like Johnson) had scraped a living as a schoolmaster, before writing encyclopedia articles for bread-and-butter wages, also took great exception to one note which took for granted that when Johnson spoke of having lived on 4¬Ω d a day he was disclosing something of which he should have been ashamed to speak) *that Croker had not preserved the integrity of Boswell's text, but had interpolated text from four other accounts of Johnson (Hawkins, Mrs Thrale etc.), distinguished only from genuine Boswell by being inside brackets, so that ‚ÄúYou begin a sentence under Boswell‚Äôs guidance, thinking to be carried happily through it by the same: but no; in the middle, perhaps after your semi-colon, and some consequent ‚Äòfor‚Äô ‚Äì starts up one of these Bracket- ligatures, and stitches you in half a page to twenty or thirty pages of a Hawkins, Tyers, Murphy, Piozzi; so that often one must make the old sad reflection, Where we are, we know; whither we are going no man knoweth‚Äù Croker made no immediate reply to Macaulay's attack, but when the first two volumes of Macaulay's History appeared he took the opportunity of pointing out the inaccuracies in the work. George Birkbeck Hill in his preface to his 1887 edition of Boswell endorses much of Macaulay's criticism of Croker, but adds, \\"I should be wanting in justice were I not to acknowledge that I owe much to the labours of Mr Croker\\". Hill observed that Croker was \\"not deeply versed in books\\", was \\"shallow in himself\\", did not understand Johnson's strong character, seemed inadequately acquainted with Johnson's writings, failed to grasp Boswell's flair as a biographer, and \\"is careless in small matters, and his blunders are numerous\\": :Yet he has added considerably to our knowledge of Johnson. He knew men who had intimately known both the hero and his biographer, and he gathered much that but for his care would have been lost for ever.

It was left unfinished at the time of his death, but it was afterwards completed by Whitwell Elwin and William John Courthope. He died at St Albans Bank, Hampton. Croker was generally supposed to be the original from which Benjamin Disraeli drew the character of \\"Rigby\\" in Coningsby, because he had for many years had the sole management of the estates of the Marquess of Hertford, the \\"Lord Monmouth\\" of the story. Hostile portrayals of Croker can also be found in the novels Florence Macarthy by Lady Morgan (a political opponent whom Croker subjected to notoriously savage reviews in the Quarterly) and The Anglo-Irish of the Nineteenth Century (1828) by John Banim. The chief works of Croker not already mentioned were: *Stories for Children from the History of England (1817), which provided the model for Scott's Tales of a Grandfather *Letters on the Naval War with America *A Reply to the Letters of Malachi Malagrowther (1826) *Military Events of the French Revolution of 1830 (1831) *a translation of Bassompierre's Embassy to England (1819) He also wrote several lyrical pieces of some merit, such as the Songs of Trafalgar (1806) and The Battles of Talavera (1809). He edited the Suffolk Papers (1823), Hervey's Memoirs of the Court of George II (1817), the Letters of Mary Lepel, Lady Hervey (1821‚Äì1822), and Walpole's Letters to Lord Hertford (1824). His memoirs, diaries and correspondence were edited by Louis J. Jennings in 1884 under the title of The Croker Papers (3 vols.). Legacy Croker Bay, named by Sir William Edward Parry.

Etymology There are various theories on the origin of Pity Me's unusual name. Most likely, as speculated in the Oxford Dictionary of British Place Names, it is simply \\"a whimsical name bestowed in the 19th century on a place considered desolate, exposed or difficult to cultivate\\". Alternatively it may be a shortened form of an earlier place name referring to a shallow lake or mere, such as Petit Mere (i.e. from Norman French), Petty Mere or Peaty Mere. Related theories suggest that it comes from Pithead Mere, referring to an extended area of boggy waste ground onto which the outwash from minehead pumping engines was discharged, or that petite mer () is an ironic name for the settlement given the arid nature of the land. However, the existence of several examples of other, lesser settlements, that share this name in Northumberland - particularly one north of Barrasford, near Hexham, and another outside Hartburn, west of Morpeth - suggests that it may be derived from some actual feature of the landscape, or former land-use, that has since been forgotten (one exotic suggestion for the North Tynedale example being the Ancient British term \\"Beddan Maes\\", meaning \\"burial ground\\" - although this suggestion has never been offered to explain the name of the Durham settlement). More obvious folk etymologies include the story that the coffin of St Cuthbert was dropped near Pity Me on the way to Durham, at which point the saint implored the monks carrying him to take pity on him and be more careful; or that coming to the location during a flight from a Viking raid, a group of monks sang the 51st Psalm, the Latin version of which includes the words \\"Miserere mei, Deus\\", which may be rendered in English as \\"Pity me, O God\\". Transport Pity Me is bypassed by the A167 which connects to Darlington and Newcastle via Chester-le-Street along the former route of the A1 through the region. The Arnison Centre, an out of town retail park, is located on the edge of the village.

Orlando Gibbons (bapt. 25 December 1583 ‚Äì 5 June 1625) was an English composer, virginalist and organist who was one of the last masters of the English Madrigal School. By the 1610s he was the leading composer and organist in England, with a career cut short by his sudden death in 1625. As a result, Gibbons's oeuvre was not as large as that of his contemporaries, like the elder William Byrd, but his compositional versatility led to him having written significant works in virtually every form of his day. He is often seen as a transitional figure from the Renaissance to the Baroque periods. Born in Oxford, Gibbons was born into a musical family where his father, William Gibbons, was a wait, his brothers, Edward, Ellis and Ferdinand musicians and Orlando being expected to follow the musical tradition. It is not known under whom he studied, although it may have been with his father, an older brother or Byrd as he was the most famous composer of the time. Irrespective of his education, he was musically proficient enough to be appointed an unsalaried member of the Chapel Royal in May 1603 and a full-fledged gentleman of the Chapel Royal as junior organist by 1605. By 1606 he had graduated from King's College, Cambridge with a Bachelor of Music degree. Throughout his professional career, Gibbons had increasingly good relations with many important people of the English court. King James I and Prince Charles were supportive patrons and others such as Sir Christopher Hatton, even became close friends. Along with Byrd and John Bull, Gibbons was the youngest contributor to the first printed collection of English keyboard music, Parthenia, and published other compositions in his lifetime, notably the First Set of Madrigals and Motets which includes the best known English madrigal: The Silver Swan. Other important compositions include This Is the Record of John, the 8-part full anthem O Clap Your Hands Together and 2 settings of Evensong. The most important position achieved by Gibbons was his appointment in 1623 as the organist at Westminster Abbey which he held for 2 years until his death on the June 5th, 1625. Gibbons was the most renowned organist of his time and by perfecting Byrd's foundations of the English madrigal, full and verse anthems he paved the way for a future generation of English composers. This generation included his oldest son Christopher, who would teach John Blow, Pelham Humfrey and most notably Henry Purcell, the English pioneer of the Baroque era. Gibbons has been described as \\"not merely to a significant figure in music's past but to a composer who can still speak directly to the present.\\" Life and career =Birthplace and background= Gibbons was born in Oxford. Until the mid-20th century he was believed to have been born in Cambridge. This was accepted as fact by his contemporaries, stated in multiple early biographies and even recorded on a monument in Canterbury Cathedral, erected in his memory soon after his death. It is even possible that Gibbons himself thought that he was born in Cambridge, since he spent most of his life there and only the first 4‚Äì5 years of his life in Oxford. Matters are made more confusing as his father had lived in Cambridge for at least 10 years, 1‚Äì3 years before the birth of Orlando. Therefore, even though 17th-century biographer Anthony Wood discovered a record of an \\"Orlando Gibbons\\" being baptised in St. Martin's Church, Oxford, it was assumed that Gibbons was born in Cambridge but baptized in Oxford. Modern historians have proved the claim that he was born in Cambridge to be incorrect. Not only was the baptismal record shown to be authentic, but it was discovered that Orlando's parents both resided in Oxford at the time of his birth, confirming that Orlando was born in Oxford and baptized at St. Martin's, Oxford. =Early life= James Sargant Storer's drawing of, Orlando Gibbons's baptism place, St. Martin's Church, Oxford, before its renovations in 1820 Gibbons was born to William and Mary Gibbons as probably the seventh of nine surviving children in Oxford, where his father was a city councillor and head of the town waits. There is no surviving record of the date of his birth, but he is recorded as being baptised at St. Martin's on Christmas Day 1583. It would be consistent with the normal practice of the time that Gibbons was born no more than a week before his baptism. Gibbons's father had previously lived in Cambridge where he was also the head of the town waits and around 1588, when Orlando was 4‚Äì5 years old, the Gibbons family moved back to Cambridge and William resumed his previous post there. Orlando was born into a musical family: not only was his father a musician, but his oldest brother, Edward, was a composer and master of the Choir of King's College, Cambridge. His second brother, Ellis, was a promising composer but died prematurely, and his third brother, Ferdinando, may have eventually taken their father's place as a wait. Not much else is known about Orlando Gibbons's youth, but being born into a musical family he was probably instructed on various instruments by his father or older brothers. At the age of 12, he became a member of Edward's Choir of King's College, Cambridge on 14 February 1596. He was a regular member of the choir until some time in the Michaelmas term of 1598. In the Easter term (summer term) of the same year he enrolled at King's College, Cambridge as a sizar, meaning he paid reduced fees but had to do various menial tasks. From 1598‚Äì99 Gibbons's name appeared sporadically in the chorus member logs, suggesting that, if not a clerical error, he continued to sing from time to time, perhaps for special occasions. Gibbons's composition teacher is unknown, but it is likely to have been an older brother or his father, as they were experienced musicians. Edward is often proposed as the most likely candidate by historians, as he was the oldest brother, had achieved a Bachelor of Music degree at King's College, Cambridge, and was already experienced as the master of the choruses there. Another possible composition teacher is William Byrd, who was at least 40 years his senior and the most respected English composer at the time. Gibbons and Byrd along with the composer John Bull later collectively published music and since Bull was a student of Byrd's, Gibbons may very well also have been. Regardless of how his musical education came about, Gibbons was known to be composing music by the end of his time at the choir in 1599, at age 15‚Äì16. =Early career and marriage= Employer of Orlando Gibbons, James I of England Gibbons's abilities had reached the point to allow him become a Musician of the Chapel Royal on 19 May 1603. His name appears at this time in a Cheque book from the Chapel Royal for services to King James I, as he was likely Gentleman Extraordinary (unpaid substitute) awaiting the vacancy of a paid position. 1603 was a year of mixed fortunes: he received his first position as a professional musician, but in the same year both his mother and his brother Ellis died. Eventually Gibbons's awaited vacancy occurred with the death of Arthur Cook, and on 21 March 1605 he secured the prestigious position of Gentleman of the Chapel Royal, as the junior chapel organist. Edward Gibbons's friendship with the former organist, Arthur Cook, and the senior chapel organist, John Bull, may have helped his younger brother secure this position. Either way, becoming a Gentleman of the Chapel Royal at the age of only 21 would have been an impressive feat at the time and he kept this position until the end of his life. In 1606 Gibbons married Elizabeth Patten on 17 February. Her father, John Patten, was a Yeoman of the Vestry in the Chapel Royal, and probably well acquainted with Gibbons, which would have helped to bring about the marriage. When Patten died in 1623, he made Gibbons his sole heir, residuary legatee and left 200 pounds for his children. The same year, shortly after his marriage, Orlando graduated from Cambridge with the degree of Bachelor in Music. Gibbons and his wife lived in Woolstaple (now Bridge Street) which was in the parish of St Margaret's, Westminster, the church where Gibbons's seven children would be baptised, including the well-known composer, Christopher Gibbons. =Publishing and patronage= By the 1610s Gibbons had become a composer of high repute and perhaps the best organist in England. At around this time he became a close friend of Sir Christopher Hatton, who became an important patron of his. Hatton was the second cousin and heir of the more famous Christopher Hatton, favourite of Queen Elizabeth I of England. In fact, Hatton and his wife, Alice Fanshawe, were probably the namesakes of two of Gibbons's children, Alice and the future composer Christopher. The next years saw the publishing of various works by Gibbons, the first of which, his First Set of Madrigals and Motets was published in 1612 under the patronage of Hatton. One of the Madrigals in the set was renowned and probably the most famous English Madrigal, The Silver Swan. Gibbons dedicated the entire set of works to Hatton and said that most of it was composed in Hatton's house: This quote has been interpreted in suggesting that Hatton wrote some or all of the poems that Gibbons set to music in his First Set of Madrigals and Motets, but there is no evidence to support this. Additionally, it is unlikely that Gibbons was a resident of Hatton's household, although their friendship suggests that Hatton may have set a room aside for him to compose. Some time in 1612‚Äì1613, Gibbons had six works published in the first printed collection of keyboard music, Parthenia, which included works by the older and important composers, Byrd and Bull. This publication was to celebrate the marriage of the Princess Elizabeth to Duke Frederick V, the Elector of Palestine. Compositions written around the time of Parthenia, including various anthems dedicated to senior clergy, the pavan Lord Salisbury for Lord Salisbury and the wedding anthem Blessed are all they in 1613 for the Earl of Somerset suggest that he was well associated throughout the court. In 1614 William Leighton published The Teares and Lamentatacions of a Sorrowfull Soule with 2 contributions by Gibbons, O Lord how do my woes increase and O Lord, I lift my heart to Thee. Although he possibly started as early as 1605, Gibbons was the joint organist with Edmund Hooper by at least 1615. The same year he received two grants from King James I, worth 150 pounds total. These grants were: Gibbons continued writing for James I, composing the anthem Great King of Gods and the court song Do not repine, fair sun in celebration of the King's 1617 visit to Scotland. =Late career= Charles, employer of Gibbons, as Prince of Wales after Daniel Mytens, c. 1623 By the late 1610s Gibbons was undoubtedly the most important musician and composer at court as Byrd had retired in Essex and Bull had fled to the Low Countries to avoid a charge of adultery. In 1617 Gibbons gained the position as keyboard player in an ensemble, organised by John Cooper, for the privy chamber of Prince Charles (later King Charles I). Gibbons was the only keyboardist in a group of 17 musicians of whom the Prince himself was thought to have occasionally joined on either the Bass-Viol or Viol da Gamba. It is likely that Gibbons was able to write for this ensemble and had pieces premiered by it. In addition to this, Gibbons probably gained a 3rd position in September 1619, attending the royal privy chamber of James I. His next major work, Fantasies of Three Parts was published around 1620 and dedicated it to Edmund Wry. This seemingly random dedication has provoked much speculation. It may be because Wry could secure Gibbons a better post, or it may be an action of gratitude for having already secured him the post for the royal privy chamber of the King. While once assumed to be fact, there is now much doubt whether Gibbons received a Doctorate of Music in May 1622. In 1815, Wood stated: This uncertainty has continued until the present day. Gibbons‚Äôs 8-part full anthem, O clap your hands was sung on 17 May 1622 at the degree ceremony for William Heather. Heather had financially supported William Camden's creation and maintenance of the Camden Professor of Ancient History chair and in return the university awarded him the honorary degrees of bachelor in music and doctor of music, even though he was not known to be a musician. The author Sir John Hawkins and musicologists Edmund Fellowes and David Mateer state unequivocally that Gibbons was awarded a doctorate along with Heather, and cite O clap your hands as the composer‚Äôs qualifying exercise for the degree. Other musicologists ‚Äì Peter Le Huray, John Harper and John Harley ‚Äì express some doubt whether Gibbons received a doctorate. Specifically, Harley cites a record in the Cheque book of the Chapel Royal that refers to William Heather as \\"doctor\\" but Gibbons as \\"senior organist.\\" The same writer refers to a letter from Camden to William Piers from 18 May 1622 that says Gibbons is a Doctor of Music. Harley suggests that the authenticity of the letter is uncertain, since the original does not survive; he suggests that Camden could have written something such as \\"G‚Äì‚Äì‚Äì‚Äìs,\\" which an editor assumed to mean Gibbons. The most convincing piece of evidence is thought to be the absence of mention of the supposed doctorate of music on Gibbons's Cambridge monument, erected in his memory when he died. Although the existing evidence seems to support the conclusion that he never achieved a doctorate in music, there is no indisputable evidence to confirm it. =Final years and death= Gibbons' memorial in Canterbury Cathedral designed by Nicholas Stone. Some time in 1623, George Wither published Hymnes and Songs of the Church in which Gibbons provided the tunes for most of the songs. The same year he succeeded John Parsons as the organist at Westminster Abbey, with Thomas Day as junior organist. This was probably the most important position Gibbons had taken in his career thus far and on 7 May 1625 he officiated at the funeral of King James I. During late May 1625, the English court was preparing to receive Queen Henrietta Maria, whom the now King Charles I of England had married through proxy in France on 1 May. Gibbons and other Chapel Royal members had begun travelling to Canterbury on 31 May when Gibbons suddenly succumbed to an illness, probably a cerebral aneurysm. He died at age 41 in Canterbury and was buried in Canterbury Cathedral. His death was a shock to his peers and brought about a post-mortem, although the cause of death aroused less comment than the haste of his burial and his body not being returned to London. His wife, Elizabeth, died a little over a year later, in her mid-30s, leaving Orlando's eldest brother, Edward, to care for the orphaned children. Music One of the most versatile English composers of his time, Gibbons wrote a large number of keyboard works, around thirty fantasias for viols, a number of madrigals (the best-known being \\"The Silver Swan\\"), and many popular verse anthems, all to English texts (the best known being \\"Great Lord of Lords\\"). Perhaps his best-known verse anthem is This Is the Record of John, which sets an Advent text for solo countertenor or tenor, alternating with full chorus. The soloist is required to demonstrate considerable technical facility, and the work expresses the text's rhetorical force without being demonstrative or bombastic. He also produced two major settings of Evensong, the Short Service and the Second Service, an extended composition combining verse and full sections. Gibbons's full anthems include the expressive O Lord, in thy wrath, and the Ascension Day anthem O clap your hands together (after Psalm 47) for eight voices. He contributed six pieces to the first printed collection of keyboard music in England, Parthenia (to which he was by far the youngest of the three contributors), published in about 1611. Gibbons's surviving keyboard output comprises some 45 pieces. The polyphonic fantasia and dance forms are the best represented genres. Gibbons's writing exhibits a command of three- and four-part counterpoint. Most of the fantasias are complex, multi-sectional pieces, treating multiple subjects imitatively. Gibbons's approach to melody, in both his fantasias and his dances, features extensive development of simple musical ideas, as for example in Pavane in D minor and Lord Salisbury's Pavan and Galliard.Apel, Willi. 1972.

Many processes in chemistry can be impeded by the presence of water; therefore, it is important that water-free reagents and techniques are used. In practice, however, it is very difficult to achieve perfect dryness; anhydrous compounds gradually absorb water from the atmosphere so they must be stored carefully. Solids Many salts and solids can be dried using heat, or under vacuum. Desiccators can also be used to store reagents in dry conditions. Common desiccants include phosphorus pentoxide and silica gel. Chemists may also require dry glassware for sensitive reactions. This can be achieved by drying glassware in an oven, by flame, or under vacuum. Dry solids can be produced by freeze-drying, which is also known as lyophilization. Liquids or solvents In many cases, the presence of water can prevent a reaction from happening, or cause undesirable products to form. To prevent this, anhydrous solvents must be used when performing certain reactions. Examples of reactions requiring the use of anhydrous solvents are the Grignard reaction and the Wurtz reaction. Solvents have typically been dried using distillation or by reaction with reactive metals or metal hydrides. These methods can be dangerous and are a common cause of lab fires. More modern techniques include the use of molecular sieves or a column purification system. Molecular sieves are far more effective than most common methods for drying solvents and are safer and require no special equipment for handling. Column solvent purification devices (generally referred to as Grubb's columns) recently became available, reducing the hazards (water reactive substances, heat) from the classical dehydrating methods. Anhydrous solvents are commercially available from chemical suppliers, and are packaged in sealed containers to maintain dryness. Typically anhydrous solvents will contain approximately 10 ppm of water and will increase in wetness if they are not properly stored. Organic solutions can be dried using a range of drying agents. Typically following a workup the organic extract is dried using magnesium sulfate or a similar drying agent to remove most remaining water. Anhydrous acetic acid is known as glacial acetic acid. Gases Several substances that exist as gases at standard conditions of temperature and pressure are commonly used as concentrated aqueous solutions. To clarify that it is the gaseous form that is being referred to, the term anhydrous is prefixed to the name of the substance: *Gaseous ammonia is generally referred to as anhydrous ammonia, to distinguish it from its solution in water, household ammonia solution, also known as ammonium hydroxide. *Gaseous hydrogen chloride is generally referred to as anhydrous, to distinguish it from its solution in water, hydrochloric acid.

Three of these were autonomous, but nominally provinces of the Ottoman Empire: Tripoli, Algiers, and Tunis. The fourth was the independent Sultanate of Morocco.

Barbary corsairs led attacks upon American merchant shipping in an attempt to extort ransom for the lives of captured sailors, and ultimately tribute from the United States to avoid further attacks, as they did with the various European states.Rojas, Martha Elena. \\"'Insults Unpunished' Barbary Captives, American Slaves, and the Negotiation of Liberty.\\" Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal. 1.2 (2003): 159‚Äì86. Before the Treaty of Paris, which formalized the United States' independence from Great Britain, U.S. shipping was protected by France during the revolutionary years under the Treaty of Alliance (1778‚Äì83). Although the treaty does not mention the Barbary States in name, it refers to common enemies between both the U.S. and France. As such, piracy against U.S. shipping only began to occur after the end of the American Revolution, when the U.S. government lost its protection under the Treaty of Alliance. This lapse of protection by a European power led to the first American merchant ship being seized after the Treaty of Paris. On 11 October 1784, Moroccan pirates seized the brigantine Betsey.Battistini, Robert. \\"Glimpses of the Other before Orientalism: The Muslim World in Early American Periodicals, 1785‚Äì1800.\\" Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal. 8.2 (2010): 446‚Äì74. The Spanish government negotiated the freedom of the captured ship and crew; however, Spain advised the United States to offer tribute to prevent further attacks against merchant ships. The U.S. Minister to France, Thomas Jefferson, decided to send envoys to Morocco and Algeria to try to purchase treaties and the freedom of the captured sailors held by Algeria.Parton, James. \\"Jefferson, American Minister in France.\\" Atlantic Monthly. 30.180 (1872): 405‚Äì24. Morocco was the first Barbary Coast State to sign a treaty with the U.S., on 23 June 1786. This treaty formally ended all Moroccan piracy against American shipping interests. Specifically, article six of the treaty states that if any Americans captured by Moroccans or other Barbary Coast States docked at a Moroccan city, they would be set free and come under the protection of the Moroccan State.Miller, Hunter. United States. \\"Barbary Treaties 1786‚Äì1816: Treaty with Morocco June 28 and July 15, 1786\\". The Avalon Project, Yale Law School. American diplomatic action with Algeria, the other major Barbary Coast State, was much less productive than with Morocco. Algeria began piracy against the U.S. on 25 July 1785 with the capture of the schooner Maria, and Dauphin a week later.Battistini, 450 All four Barbary Coast states demanded $660,000 each. However, the envoys were given only an allocated budget of $40,000 to achieve peace.Parton, 413 Diplomatic talks to reach a reasonable sum for tribute or for the ransom of the captured sailors struggled to make any headway. The crews of Maria and Dauphin remained enslaved for over a decade, and soon were joined by crews of other ships captured by the Barbary States.Rojas, 176 Captain William Bainbridge paying tribute to the Dey of Algiers, 1800 In March 1786, Thomas Jefferson and John Adams went to London to negotiate with Tripoli's envoy, ambassador Sidi Haji Abdrahaman (or Sidi Haji Abdul Rahman Adja). When they enquired \\"concerning the ground of the pretensions to make war upon nations who had done them no injury\\", the ambassador replied: > It was written in their Koran, (that all nations which had not acknowledged > the Prophet were sinners, whom it was the right and duty of the faithful to > plunder and enslave; and that every mussulman who was slain in this warfare > was sure to go to paradise). He said, also, that the man who was the first > to board a vessel had one slave over and above his share, and that when they > sprang to the deck of an enemy's ship, every sailor held a dagger in each > hand and a third in his mouth; which usually struck such terror into the foe > that they cried out for quarter at once. Jefferson reported the conversation to Secretary of Foreign Affairs John Jay, who submitted the ambassador's comments and offer to Congress. Jefferson argued that paying tribute would encourage more attacks. Although John Adams agreed with Jefferson, he believed that circumstances forced the U.S. to pay tribute until an adequate navy could be built. The U.S. had just fought an exhausting war, which put the nation deep in debt.. Various letters and testimonies by captured sailors describe their captivity as a form of slavery, even though Barbary Coast imprisonment was different from that practiced by the U.S. and European powers of the time.Rojas, 168‚Äì9. Barbary Coast prisoners were able to obtain wealth and property, along with achieving status beyond that of a slave. One such example was James Leander Cathcart, who rose to the highest position a Christian slave could achieve in Algeria, becoming an adviser to the bey (governor).Rojas, 163 Even so, most captives were pressed into hard labor in the service of the Barbary pirates, and struggled under extremely poor conditions that exposed them to vermin and disease. As word of their treatment reached the U.S., through freed captives' narratives and letters, Americans pushed for direct government action to stop the piracy against U.S. ships. On July 19, 1794, Congress appropriated $800,000 for the release of American prisoners and for a peace treaty with Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli. On September 5, 1795, American negotiator Joseph Donaldson signed a peace treaty with the Dey of Algiers, that included an upfront payment of $642,500 in specie (silver coinage) for peace, the release of American captives, expenses, and various gifts for the Dey's royal court and family. An additional indefinite yearly tribute of $21,600 in shipbuilding supplies and ammunition would be given to the Dey. The treaty, designed to prevent further piracy, resulted in the release of 115 American sailors held captive by the Dey.Rojas, 165. 1816 illustration of Christian slaves Jefferson continued to argue for cessation of the tribute, with rising support from George Washington and others. With the recommissioning of the American Navy in 1794 and the resulting increased firepower on the seas, it became increasingly possible for America to refuse paying tribute, although by now the long-standing habit was hard to overturn. The continuing demand for tribute ultimately led to the formation of the United States Department of the Navy, founded in 1798Blum, Hester. \\"Pirated Tars, Piratical Texts Barbary Captivity and American Sea Narratives.\\" Early American Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal. 1.2 (2003): 133‚Äì58. to prevent further attacks upon American shipping and to end the demands for extremely large tributes from the Barbary States. Federalist and Anti-Federalist forces argued over the needs of the country and the burden of taxation. Jefferson's own Democratic-Republicans and anti-navalists believed that the future of the country lay in westward expansion, with Atlantic trade threatening to siphon money and energy away from the new nation, to be spent on wars in the Old World. During the divisive election of 1800, Thomas Jefferson defeated President John Adams. Jefferson was sworn into office on March 4, 1801. The third President believed military force, rather than endless tributes, would be needed to resolve the Tripoli crisis. Declaration of war and naval blockade Just before Jefferson's inauguration in 1801, Congress passed naval legislation that, among other things, provided for six frigates that \\"shall be officered and manned as the President of the United States may direct.\\" In the event of a declaration of war on the United States by the Barbary powers, these ships were to \\"protect our commerce and chastise their insolence‚Äîby sinking, burning or destroying their ships and vessels wherever you shall find them.\\" On Jefferson's inauguration as president in 1801, Yusuf Karamanli, the Pasha (or Bashaw) of Tripoli, demanded $225,000 (equivalent to $ million in ) from the new administration. (In 1800, federal revenues totaled a little over $10 million). Putting his long-held beliefs into practice, Jefferson refused the demand. Consequently, on 10 May 1801, the Pasha declared war on the U.S., not through any formal written documents but in the customary Barbary manner of cutting down the flagstaff in front of the U.S. Consulate. Algiers and Tunis did not follow their ally in Tripoli. Before learning that Tripoli had declared war on the United States, Jefferson sent a small squadron, consisting of three frigates and one schooner, under the command of Commodore Richard Dale with gifts and letters to attempt to maintain peace with the Barbary powers. However, in the event that war had been declared, Dale was instructed \\"to protect American ships and citizens against potential aggression,\\" but Jefferson \\"insisted that he was \\"unauthorized by the constitution, without the sanction of Congress, to go beyond the line of defense.\\" He told Congress: \\"I communicate [to you] all material information on this subject, that in the exercise of this important function confided by the constitution to the legislature exclusively their judgment may form itself on a knowledge and consideration of every circumstance of weight.\\"Woods, Thomas (2005-07-07) Presidential War Powers, LewRockwell.com Although Congress never voted on a formal declaration of war, it authorized the President to instruct the commanders of armed American vessels to seize all vessels and goods of the Pasha of Tripoli \\"and also to cause to be done all such other acts of precaution or hostility as the state of war will justify.\\" The American squadron joined a Swedish flotilla under Rudolf Cederstr√∂m in blockading Tripoli, the Swedes having been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800. Enterprise capturing Tripoli On 31 May 1801, Commodore Edward Preble traveled to Messina, Sicily, to the court of King Ferdinand IV of the Kingdom of Naples. The kingdom was at war with Napoleon, but Ferdinand supplied the Americans with manpower, craftsmen, supplies, gunboats, mortar boats, and the ports of Messina, Syracuse, and Palermo to be used as naval bases for launching operations against Tripoli, a port walled fortress city protected by 150 pieces of heavy artillery and manned by 25,000 soldiers, assisted by a fleet of 10 ten-gunned brigs, 2 eight-gun schooners, two large galleys, and 19 gunboats.Tucker, Glenn. Dawn like Thunder: The Barbary Wars and the Birth of the U.S. Navy. Indianapolis, Bobbs-Merrill, 1963. . p. 293. The schooner (commanded by Lieutenant Andrew Sterret) defeated the 14-gun Tripolitan corsair Tripoli after a one-sided battle on 1 August 1801. In 1802, in response to Jefferson's request for authority to deal with the pirates, Congress passed \\"An act for the protection of commerce and seamen of the United States against the Tripolitan cruisers,\\" authorizing the President to \\"employ such of the armed vessels of the United States as may be judged requisite... for protecting effectually the commerce and seamen thereof on the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and adjoining seas.\\" The statute authorized American ships to seize vessels belonging to the Bey of Tripoli, with the captured property distributed to those who brought the vessels into port. The U.S. Navy went unchallenged on the sea, but still, the question remained undecided. Jefferson pressed the issue the following year, with an increase in military force and deployment of many of the navy's best ships to the region throughout 1802. USS , USS , USS , USS , USS , USS , USS , USS Vixen, USS President, USS Congress, USS Essex, USS John Adams, USS Nautilus, USS Scourge, USS , and USS Hornet (joined in 1805) all saw service during the war, under the overall command of Preble. Throughout 1803, Preble set up and maintained a blockade of the Barbary ports and executed a campaign of raids and attacks against the cities' fleets.

Efforts by the Americans to float the ship while under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan Naval units failed. The ship, her captain, William Bainbridge, and all officers and crew were taken ashore and held as hostages. Philadelphia was turned against the Americans and anchored in the harbor as a gun battery. An 1897 painting of the burning of the USS Philadelphia On the night of 16 February 1804, Captain Stephen Decatur led a small detachment of U.S. Marines aboard the captured Tripolitan ketch rechristened USS Intrepid, thus deceiving the guards on Philadelphia to float close enough to board her. Decatur's men stormed the ship and overpowered the Tripolitan sailors. With fire support from the American warships, the Marines set fire to Philadelphia, denying her use by the enemy. Preble attacked Tripoli on 14 July 1804, in a series of inconclusive battles, including an unsuccessful attack attempting to use Intrepid under Captain Richard Somers as a fire ship, packed with explosives and sent to enter Tripoli harbor, where she would destroy herself and the enemy fleet. However, Intrepid was destroyed, possibly by enemy gunfire, before she achieved her goal, killing Somers and his entire crew.Tucker, 2005, pp. 326‚Äì331. The turning point in the war was the Battle of Derna (April‚ÄìMay 1805). Ex-consul William Eaton, a former Army captain who used the title of \\"general\\", and US Marine Corps 1st Lieutenant Presley O'Bannon led a force of eight U.S. Marines Eaton had requested 100 Marines, but had been limited to eight by Commodore Barron, who wished to budget his forces differently. . and five hundred mercenaries‚ÄîGreeks from Crete, Arabs, and Berbers‚Äîon a march across the desert from Alexandria, Egypt, to capture the Tripolitan city of Derna. This was the first time the United States flag was raised in victory on foreign soil. The action is memorialized in a line of the Marines' Hymn‚Äî\\"the shores of Tripoli\\". The capturing of the city gave American negotiators leverage in securing the return of hostages and the end of the war. Peace treaty and legacy Wearied of the blockade and raids, and now under threat of a continued advance on Tripoli proper and a scheme to restore his deposed older brother Hamet Karamanli as ruler, Yusuf Karamanli signed a treaty ending hostilities on 10 June 1805. Article 2 of the treaty reads: > The Bashaw of Tripoli shall deliver up to the American squadron now off > Tripoli, all the Americans in his possession; and all the subjects of the > Bashaw of Tripoli now in the power of the United States of America shall be > delivered up to him; and as the number of Americans in possession of the > Bashaw of Tripoli amounts to three hundred persons, more or less; and the > number of Tripolino subjects in the power of the Americans to about, one > hundred more or less; The Bashaw of Tripoli shall receive from the United > States of America, the sum of sixty thousand dollars, as a payment for the > difference between the prisoners herein mentioned. In agreeing to pay a ransom of $60,000 for the American prisoners, the Jefferson administration drew a distinction between paying tribute and paying ransom. At the time, some argued that buying sailors out of slavery was a fair exchange to end the war. William Eaton, however, remained bitter for the rest of his life about the treaty, feeling that his efforts had been squandered by the American emissary from the U.S. Department of State, diplomat Tobias Lear. Eaton and others felt that the capture of Derna should have been used as a bargaining chip to obtain the release of all American prisoners without having to pay ransom. Furthermore, Eaton believed the honor of the United States had been compromised when it abandoned Hamet Karamanli after promising to restore him as leader of Tripoli. Eaton's complaints generally went unheard, especially as attention turned to the strained international relations which would ultimately lead to the withdrawal of the U.S. Navy from the area in 1807 and to the War of 1812.Herring, George C. From Colony to Superpower: U.S. Foreign Relations since 1776. New York: Oxford University Press, 2008. . p. 100. The First Barbary War was beneficial to the reputation of the United States' military command and war mechanism, which had been up to that time relatively untested. The First Barbary War showed that America could execute a war far from home, and that American forces had the cohesion to fight together as Americans rather than separately as Georgians, New Yorkers, etc. The United States Navy and Marines became a permanent part of the American government and American history, and Decatur returned to the U.S. as its first post- revolutionary war hero.Tucker, 2005, p. 464. However, the more immediate problem of Barbary piracy was not fully settled. By 1807, Algiers had gone back to taking American ships and seamen hostage. Distracted by the preludes to the War of 1812, the U.S. was unable to respond to the provocation until 1815, with the Second Barbary War, in which naval victories by Commodores William Bainbridge and Stephen Decatur led to treaties ending all tribute payments by the U.S.Gerard W.

Sweden had been at war with the Tripolitans since 1800 and were joined by the newly-independent US. The First Barbary War extended from 10 May, 1801 to 10 June 1805, with the Second Barbary War lasting only three days, ending on 19 June, 1815. The wars were largely a reaction to piracy carried out by the Barbary states. Since the 16th century, Muslim pirates operating out of North Africa had captured ships and even raided cities across the Mediterranean Sea. By the 19th century, pirate activity had declined, but Barbary pirates continued to demand tribute from American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean. Refusal to pay would result in the capturing of American ships and goods, and often the enslavement or ransoming of crew members. After Thomas Jefferson became president of the US in March of 1801, he sent a US Naval fleet to the Mediterranean to combat the Barbary pirates. The fleet bombarded numerous fortified cities in present-day Libya, Tunisia, and Algeria, ultimately extracting concessions of safe conduct from the Barbary states and ending the first war. During the War of 1812, with the encouragement of Great Britain, the Barbary corsairs resumed their attacks on American vessels. Following the conclusion of the War of 1812 and America's attainment of peace with Britain, James Madison, Jefferson's successor, directed military forces against the Barbary states in the Second Barbary War. Lasting only three days, the second conflict essentially ended piracy in the Mediterranean. Background The Barbary corsairs were pirates and privateers who operated out of North Africa, based primarily in the ports of Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers. This area was known in Europe as the Barbary Coast, in reference to the Berbers. Their predation extended throughout the Mediterranean, south along West Africa's Atlantic seaboard and even to the eastern coast of South America with Brazil,A 44-gun Algerian corsair appeared at R√≠o de la Plata in 1720. Ces√°reo Fern√°ndez Duro, Armada espa√±ola desde la uni√≥n de los reinos de Castilla y de Le√≥n, Madrid, 1902, Vol. VI, p. 185 and into the North Atlantic Ocean as far north as Iceland, but they primarily operated in the western Mediterranean. In addition to seizing ships, they engaged in razzias, raids on European coastal towns and villages, mainly in Italy, France, Spain, and Portugal, but also in England, Scotland, the Netherlands, Ireland, and as far away as Iceland. The main purpose of their attacks was to capture Europeans for the Arab slave market in North Africa. The Barbary states were nominally part of the Ottoman Empire, but in practice they were independent and the Ottoman government in Constantinople was not involved.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 page 20. =Attacks= Since the 1600s, the Barbary pirates had attacked British shipping along the North Coast of Africa, holding captives for ransom or enslaving them. Ransoms were generally raised by families and local church groups. The British became familiar with captivity narratives written by Barbary pirates' prisoners and slaves.Linda Colley, Captives: Britain, Empire, and the World, 1600‚Äì1850, New York: Anchor Books Edition, 2000 During the American Revolutionary War, the pirates attacked American ships. On December 20, 1777, Morocco's sultan Mohammed III declared that merchant ships of the new American nation would be under the protection of the sultanate and could thus enjoy safe passage into the Mediterranean and along the coast. The Moroccan-American Treaty of Friendship stands as America's oldest unbroken friendship treatyRoberts, Priscilla H. and Richard S. Roberts, Thomas Barclay 1728‚Äì1793: Consul in France, Diplomat in Barbary, Lehigh University Press, 2008, pp. 206‚Äì223. with a foreign power. In 1787, Morocco became one of the first nations to recognize the United States of America. Starting in the 1780s, realizing that American vessels were no longer under the protection of the British navy, the Barbary pirates had started seizing American ships in the Mediterranean. As the U.S. had disbanded its Continental Navy and had no seagoing military force, its government agreed in 1786 to pay tribute to stop the attacks.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 pages 32-33 On March 20, 1794, at the urging of President George Washington, Congress voted to authorize the building of six heavy frigates and establish the United States Navy, in order to stop these attacks and demands for more and more money.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 page 33. The United States had signed treaties with all of the Barbary states after its independence was recognized between 1786-1794 to pay tribute in exchange for leaving American merchantmen alone, and by 1797, the United States had paid out $1.25 million or a fifth of the government's annual budget then in tribute.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 pages 36-37 These demands for tribute had imposed a heavy financial drain and by 1799 the U.S. was in arrears of $140,000 to Algiers and some $150,000 to Tripoli.Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 page 37 Many Americans resented these payments, arguing that the money would be better spent on a navy that would protect American ships from the attacks of the Barbary pirates, and in the 1800 Presidential Election, Thomas Jefferson won against incumbent second President John Adams, in part by noting that the United States was \\"subjected to the spoliations of foreign cruisers\\" and was humiliated by paying \\"an enormous tribute to the petty tyrant of Algiers\\".Fremont-Barnes, Gregory The Wars of the Barbary Pirates, London: Osprey, 2006 page 7 First Barbary War (1801‚Äì1805) Painting depicting the bombardment of Tripoli on 3 August 1804 The First Barbary War (1801‚Äì1805), also known as the Tripolitian War or the Barbary Coast War, was the first of two wars fought between the alliance of the United States and several European countries against the Northwest African Muslim states known collectively as the Barbary states. These were Tripoli and Algiers, which were quasi-independent entities nominally belonging to the Ottoman Empire, and (briefly) the independent Sultanate of Morocco. This war began during Thomas Jefferson's term when he refused to pay tribute, an amount that was greatly increased when he became president. A U.S. naval fleet was sent on May 13, 1801, at the beginning of the war under the command of Commodore Richard Dale. Other notable officers in the fleet included Stephen Decatur, assigned to the frigate and William Bainbridge in command of Essex which was attached to Commodore Richard Dale's squadron which also included , and .Harris, 1837 pp.63‚Äì64, 251 During this war, the ship Philadelphia was blockading Tripoli's harbor when she ran aground on an uncharted reef. Under fire from shore batteries and Tripolitan gunboats, the Captain, William Bainbridge, tried to refloat her by casting off all of her guns and other objects that weighed it down. The ship was eventually captured and the crew taken prisoners and put into slavery. To prevent this powerful war ship from being used by the Barbary pirates the ship was later destroyed by a raiding party led by Stephen Decatur.Tucker, 1937 p.57MacKenzie, 1846 pp.331‚Äì335 Second Barbary War (1815) The Second Barbary War (1815), also known as the Algerine or Algerian War, was the second of two wars fought between the United States and the Ottoman Empire's North African regencies of Tripoli, Tunis and Algeria, known collectively as the Barbary states. The war between the Barbary States and the U.S. ended in 1815; the international dispute would effectively be ended the following year by the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. The war brought an end to the American practice of paying tribute to the pirate states and helped mark the beginning of the end of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination (16th‚Äì18th centuries). Within decades, European powers built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology.Liener, 2007, pp.39‚Äì50 Effect in United States When the United States military efforts of the early 19th century were successful against the pirates, partisans of the Democratic-Republicans contrasted their presidents' refusals to buy off the pirates by paying tribute with the failure of the preceding Federalist administration to suppress the piracy. The Federalist Party had adopted the slogan, \\"Millions for defense, but not one cent for tribute,\\" but had failed to end the attacks on merchant ships. From 1796‚Äì1797 French raiders seized some 316 American merchant ships flying American colors. To counter this ongoing advent three frigates, , and , were soon built to answer the call for security.Simons, 2003, p. 20 Later In the 21st century, the United States again conducted military operation in the North African area, specifically participating in the intervention against the government of Libya, and this operation has sometimes been termed in the media as the continuation of the previous Barbary Wars and given the name \\"Third Barbary War\\".

The aim of the game is to reach square number sixty-three before any of the other players, while avoiding obstacles such as the Inn, the Bridge and Death. The game is thought to have originated in the 16th century, and is considered the prototype of many of the commercial European racing board games of later centuries. The game is mostly played in Europe and seen as family entertainment. Commercial versions of the game appeared in the 1880s and 1890s, and feature typical old European characteristics such as an old well and children in clothes from the period. History The game's origins are uncertain. Some connect the game with the Phaistos Disc because of its spiral shape but, as Caroline Goodfellow notes, the two games \\"are unlikely to have been the same\\".Goodfellow, C. (2002) Games and Puzzles: The Collectors' Guide to Indoor Games from the 1700s to the Present Day. Eagle Editions. Royston. p. 10. A version of the game was given as a gift by Francesco I de' Medici of Florence to King Philip II of Spain sometime between 1574 and 1587. In June 1597 John Wolfe enters the game in the Stationers' Register, as \\"the newe and most pleasant game of the goose\\".Duggan, E. (2016) Early Modern Board Games: The Royal Game of Goose. University of Suffolk. p. 4. In the 1960s, the game company CO-5 marketed a variant called Gooses Wild. Description The board consists of a track with consecutively numbered spaces (usually 63), and is often arranged in a spiral with the starting point at the outside. Each player's piece is moved according to throws of one or two dice. Scattered throughout the board are a number of spaces on which a goose is depicted; landing on a goose allows the player to move again by the same distance. Additional shortcuts, such as spaces marked with a bridge, move the player to some other specified position. There are also a few penalty spaces which force the player to move backwards or lose one or more turns, the most recognizable being the one marked with a skull and symbolizing death; landing on this space results in the player being sent back to start. On Spanish boards the reverse is usually a parch√≠s board. Many themed versions of the game have been created, depicting topics as diverse as ice skating, Richard Nixon, and sewage pumps. These can be valued for their historical or artistic merits even by those who have no interest in the game itself, with some editions having been sold for thousands of dollars at auction or displayed in museums.

Established in 1899, it is one of the oldest companies in the distribution of alcoholic beverages in Japan, and makes Japanese whisky. Its business has expanded to other fields, and the company now also makes soft drinks and operates sandwich chains. With its 2014 acquisition of Beam, Inc., it has diversified internationally and become one of the largest makers of distilled beverages in the world. Suntory is headquartered in Dojimahama 2-chome, Kita-ku, Osaka, Osaka Prefecture. History Suntory was started by , who first opened his store in Osaka on February 1, 1899, to sell imported wines. In 1907, the store began selling a fortified wine called Akadama Port Wine. The store became the Kotobukiya company in 1921 to further expand its business and in 1923, Torii built Japan's first malt whisky distillery Yamazaki Distillery. Production began in December 1924 and five years later Suntory Whisky Shirofuda (White Label), the first single malt whisky made in Japan, was sold. Due to shortages during World War II, Kotobukiya was forced to halt its development of new products, but in 1946 it re-released Torys Whisky, which sold well in post-war Japan. In 1961, Kotobukiya launched the \\"Drink Torys and Go to Hawaii\\" campaign. At the time, a trip abroad was considered a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. In 1963, Kotobukiya changed its name to \\"Suntory\\", taken from the name of the whisky it produces. In the same year, Musashino Beer Factory began its production of the Suntory Beer. In 1997, the company became Japan's sole bottler, distributor, and licensee of Pepsi products. On April 1, 2009, Suntory became a stockholding company named and established , , , , , , and .Suntory News Release on January 19, 2009 (Global website), (Japan website) - Suntory Limited On July 14, 2009, Kirin announced that it was negotiating with Suntory on a merger.„Ç≠„É™„É≥Ôºö„Çµ„É≥„Éà„É™„Éº„Å®ÁµåÂñ∂Áµ±Âêà„Å∏‰∫§Ê∏â - ÊØéÊó•ÔΩäÔΩê(ÊØéÊó•Êñ∞ËÅû) Mainichi Shimbun (Retrieved on July 13, 2009) On February 8, 2010, it was announced that negotiations between the two were terminated.Termination of Merger Negotiation with Kirin Suntory News Release (Retrieved on February 8, 2010) In 2009 Suntory acquired Orangina, the orange soft drink for 300 billion yen, and Frucor energy drinks for 600 million euros.

In 1991, the team won the intense global race to isolate the gene responsible for blue flowers, and has since developed a range of genetically modified flowers expressing colors in the blue spectrum, as well as a number of other breakthroughs extending the vase life of cut flowers. In 2003, Suntory acquired a 98.5% equity holding in Florigene. Prior to this, Florigene had been a subsidiary of global agrochemicals giant Nufarm since 1999. In July 2004, Suntory and Florigene scientists announced to the world the development of the first roses containing blue pigment, an important step toward the creation of a truly blue colored rose. In July 2011, Suntory Beverage and Food Limited together with PT GarudaFood from Tudung Group in Indonesia have agreed to make a new firm to produce non-alcoholic drink with 51 percent and 49 percent shares respectively. It will produce Suntory Oolong Tea, Boss and Orangina. In April 2019 Suntory partnered with Drinkripples, an Israeli-based company.

Weaire, S. Hutzler, \\"The Physics of Foams\\", Oxford University Press, 1999, , I. Cantat, S. Cohen-Addad, F. Elias, F. Graner, R. H√∂hler, O. Pitois, F. Rouyer, A. Saint-Jalmes, \\"Foams: structure and dynamics\\", Oxford University Press, ed. S.J. Cox, 2013, A bath sponge and the head on a glass of beer are examples of foams. In most foams, the volume of gas is large, with thin films of liquid or solid separating the regions of gas. Soap foams are also known as suds. Solid foams can be closed-cell or open-cell. In closed-cell foam, the gas forms discrete pockets, each completely surrounded by the solid material. In open-cell foam, gas pockets connect to each other. A bath sponge is an example of an open-cell foam: water easily flows through the entire structure, displacing the air. A camping mat is an example of a closed-cell foam: gas pockets are sealed from each other so the mat cannot soak up water. Foams are examples of dispersed media. In general, gas is present, so it divides into gas bubbles of different sizes (i.e., the material is polydisperse)‚Äîseparated by liquid regions that may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase drains out of the system films. When the principal scale is small, i.e., for a very fine foam, this dispersed medium can be considered a type of colloid. Foam can also refer to something that is analogous to foam, such as quantum foam, polyurethane foam (foam rubber), XPS foam, polystyrene, phenolic, or many other manufactured foams.  Structure  A foam is, in many cases, a multi-scale system. Order and disorder of bubbles in a surface foam One scale is the bubble: material foams are typically disordered and have a variety of bubble sizes. At larger sizes, the study of idealized foams is closely linked to the mathematical problems of minimal surfaces and three-dimensional tessellations, also called honeycombs. The Weaire‚ÄìPhelan structure is considered the best possible (optimal) unit cell of a perfectly ordered foam, while Plateau's laws describe how soap-films form structures in foams. At lower scale than the bubble is the thickness of the film for metastable foams, which can be considered a network of interconnected films called lamellae. Ideally, the lamellae connect in triads and radiate 120¬∞ outward from the connection points, known as Plateau borders. An even lower scale is the liquid‚Äìair interface at the surface of the film. Most of the time this interface is stabilized by a layer of amphiphilic structure, often made of surfactants, particles (Pickering emulsion), or more complex associations.  Mechanical properties of solid foams  Solid foams, both open-cell and closed-cell, are considered as a sub-class of cellular structures. They often have lower nodal connectivity as compared to other cellular structures like honeycombs and truss lattices, and thus, their failure mechanism is dominated by bending of members. Low nodal connectivity and the resulting failure mechanism ultimately lead to their lower mechanical strength and stiffness compared to honeycombs and truss lattices.  Formation  Several conditions are needed to produce foam: there must be mechanical work, surface active components (surfactants) that reduce the surface tension, and the formation of foam faster than its breakdown. To create foam, work (W) is needed to increase the surface area (ŒîA): : W = \\\\gamma \\\\Delta A \\\\,\\\\\\\\! where Œ≥ is the surface tension. One of the ways foam is created is through dispersion, where a large amount of gas is mixed with a liquid. A more specific method of dispersion involves injecting a gas through a hole in a solid into a liquid. If this process is completed very slowly, then one bubble can be emitted from the orifice at a time as shown in the picture below. One of the theories for determining the separation time is shown below; however, while this theory produces theoretical data that matches with the experimental data, detachment due to capillarity is accepted as a better explanation. Rising bubble from orifice The buoyancy force acts to raise the bubble, which is : F_b = Vg(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)\\\\\\\\! where V is the volume of the bubble, g is the acceleration due to gravity, and œÅ1 is the density of the gas œÅ2 is the density of the liquid. The force working against the buoyancy force is the surface tension force, which is : F_s = 2r \\\\pi\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\!, where Œ≥ is the surface tension, and r is the radius of the orifice. As more air is pushed into the bubble, the buoyancy force grows quicker than the surface tension force. Thus, detachment occurs when the buoyancy force is large enough to overcome the surface tension force. : Vg(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)> 2r \\\\pi\\\\gamma\\\\\\\\! In addition, if the bubble is treated as a sphere with a radius of R and the volume V is substituted in to the equation above, separation occurs at the moment when : R^3=\\\\frac{3r\\\\gamma}{2g(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)}\\\\\\\\! Examining this phenomenon from a capillarity viewpoint for a bubble that is being formed very slowly, it can be assumed that the pressure p inside is constant everywhere. The hydrostatic pressure in the liquid is designated by p_0. The change in pressure across the interface from gas to liquid is equal to the capillary pressure; hence, : p-p_0=\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\\\frac{1}{R_2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! where R1 and R2 are the radii of curvature and are set as positive. At the stem of the bubble, R3 and R4 are the radii of curvature also treated as positive. Here the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid has to take in account z, the distance from the top to the stem of the bubble. The new hydrostatic pressure at the stem of the bubble is p0(œÅ1 ‚àí œÅ2)z. The hydrostatic pressure balances the capillary pressure, which is shown below: : p-p_0-(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)gz=\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_3}+\\\\frac{1}{R_4}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! Finally, the difference in the top and bottom pressure equal the change in hydrostatic pressure: : (\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)gz=\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\\\frac{1}{R_2}-\\\\frac{1}{R_3}-\\\\frac{1}{R_4}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! At the stem of the bubble, the shape of the bubble is nearly cylindrical; consequently, either R3 or R4 is large while the other radius of curvature is small. As the stem of the bubble grows in length, it becomes more unstable as one of the radius grows and the other shrinks. At a certain point, the vertical length of the stem exceeds the circumference of the stem and due to the buoyancy forces the bubble separates and the process repeats.Bikerman, J.J. \\"Formation and Structure\\" in Foams New York, Springer-Verlag, 1973. ch 2. sec 24‚Äì25  Stability  = Stabilization = left left The stabilization of a foam is caused by van der Waals forces between the molecules in the foam, electrical double layers created by dipolar surfactants, and the Marangoni effect, which acts as a restoring force to the lamellae. The Marangoni effect depends on the liquid that is foaming being impure. Generally, surfactants in the solution decrease the surface tension. The surfactants also clump together on the surface and form a layer as shown below. For the Marangoni effect to occur, the foam must be indented as shown in the first picture. This indentation increases local surface area. Surfactants have a larger diffusion time than the bulk of the solution‚Äîso the surfactants are less concentrated in the indentation. Also, surface stretching makes the surface tension of the indented spot greater than the surrounding area. Consequentially‚Äîsince diffusion time for the surfactants is large‚Äîthe Marangoni effect has time to take place. The difference in surface tension creates a gradient, which instigates fluid flow from areas of lower surface tension to areas of higher surface tension. The second picture shows the film at equilibrium after the Marangoni effect has taken place. = Destabilization = Rybczynski and Hadamar developed an equation to calculate the velocity of bubbles that rise in foam with the assumption that the bubbles are spherical with a radius r. : u=\\\\frac{2gr^2}{9\\\\eta_2}(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)\\\\left (\\\\frac{3\\\\eta_1+3\\\\eta_2}{3\\\\eta_1+2\\\\eta_2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! with velocity in units of centimeters per second. œÅ1 and œÅ2 is the density for a gas and liquid respectively in units of g/cm3 and ·øÉ1 and ·øÉ2 is the viscosity of the gas and liquid g/cm¬∑s and g is the acceleration in units of cm/s2. However, since the density and viscosity of a liquid is much greater than the gas, the density and viscosity of the gas can be neglected, which yields the new equation for velocity of bubbles rising as: : u=\\\\frac{gr^2}{3\\\\eta_2}(\\\\rho_2)\\\\\\\\! However, through experiments it has been shown that a more accurate model for bubbles rising is: : u=\\\\frac{2gr^2}{9\\\\eta_2}(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)\\\\\\\\! Deviations are due to the Marangoni effect and capillary pressure, which affect the assumption that the bubbles are spherical. For laplace pressure of a curved gas liquid interface, the two principal radii of curvature at a point are R1 and R2.Wilson, A.J, \\"Principles of Foam Formation and Stability.\\" Foams: Physics, Chemistry, and Structure. New York, Springer-Verlag, 1989, ch 1 With a curved interface, the pressure in one phase is greater than the pressure in another phase. The capillary pressure Pc is given by the equation of: : P_c=\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_1}+\\\\frac{1}{R_2}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\!, where \\\\gamma is the surface tension. The bubble shown below is a gas (phase 1) in a liquid (phase 2) and point A designates the top of the bubble while point B designates the bottom of the bubble. Bubble for hydrostatic pressure At the top of the bubble at point A, the pressure in the liquid is assumed to be p0 as well as in the gas. At the bottom of the bubble at point B, the hydrostatic pressure is: : P_B,1=p_0+g\\\\rho_1z\\\\\\\\! : P_B,2=p_0+g\\\\rho_2z\\\\\\\\! where œÅ1 and œÅ2 is the density for a gas and liquid respectively. The difference in hydrostatic pressure at the top of the bubble is 0, while the difference in hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the bubble across the interface is gz(œÅ2 ‚àí œÅ1). Assuming that the radii of curvature at point A are equal and denoted by RA and that the radii of curvature at point B are equal and denoted by RB, then the difference in capillary pressure between point A and point B is: : P_c=2\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_A}-\\\\frac{1}{R_B}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! At equilibrium, the difference in capillary pressure must be balanced by the difference in hydrostatic pressure. Hence, : gz(\\\\rho_2-\\\\rho_1)=2\\\\gamma\\\\left (\\\\frac{1}{R_A}-\\\\frac{1}{R_B}\\\\right)\\\\\\\\! Since, the density of the gas is less than the density of the liquid the left hand side of the equation is always positive. Therefore, the inverse of RA must be larger than the RB. Meaning that from the top of the bubble to the bottom of the bubble the radius of curvature increases. Therefore, without neglecting gravity the bubbles cannot be spherical. In addition, as z increases, this causes the difference in RA and RB too, which means the bubble deviates more from its shape the larger it grows. Foam destabilization occurs for several reasons. First, gravitation causes drainage of liquid to the foam base, which Rybczynski and Hadamar include in their theory; however, foam also destabilizes due to osmotic pressure causes drainage from the lamellas to the Plateau borders due to internal concentration differences in the foam, and Laplace pressure causes diffusion of gas from small to large bubbles due to pressure difference. In addition, films can break under disjoining pressure, These effects can lead to rearrangement of the foam structure at scales larger than the bubbles, which may be individual (T1 process) or collective (even of the \\"avalanche\\" type).  Experiments and characterizations  Being a multiscale system involving many phenomena, and a versatile medium, foam can be studied using many different techniques. Considering the different scales, experimental techniques are diffraction ones, mainly light scattering techniques (DWS, see below, static and dynamic light scattering, X rays and neutron scattering) at sub-micrometer scales, or microscopic ones. Considering the system as continuous, its bulk properties can be characterized by light transmittance but also conductimetry. The correlation between structure and bulk is evidenced more accurately by acoustics in particular. The organisation between bubbles has been studied numerically using sequential attempts of evolution of the minimum surface energy either at random (Pott's model) or deterministic way (surface evolver). The evolution with time (i.e., the dynamics) can be simulated using these models, or the bubble model (Durian), which considers the motion of individual bubbles. Observations of the small- scale structure can be made by shining the foam with laser light or x-ray beams and measuring the reflectivity of the films between bubbles. Observations of the global structure can be done using neutron scattering. Reflection of radiation by a foam Measurement principle of multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning A typical light scattering (or diffusion) optical technique, multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning, is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilization phenomena.I.

Texter (2004) It works on any concentrated dispersions without dilution, including foams. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the bubbles. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (drainage, syneresis) and global changes in size (ripening, coalescence) are detected and monitored.  Applications  = Liquid foams = Liquid foams can be used in fire retardant foam, such as those that are used in extinguishing fires, especially oil fires. In some ways, leavened bread is a foam, as the yeast causes the bread to rise by producing tiny bubbles of gas in the dough. The dough has traditionally been understood as a closed-cell foam, in which the pores do not connect with each other. Cutting the dough releases the gas in the bubbles that are cut, but the gas in the rest of the dough cannot escape. When dough is allowed to rise too far, it becomes an open-cell foam, in which the gas pockets are connected. Now, if the dough is cut or the surface otherwise broken, a large volume of gas can escape, and the dough collapses. The open structure of an over-risen dough is easy to observe: instead of consisting of discrete gas bubbles, the dough consists of a gas space filled with threads of the flour-water paste. Recent research has indicated that the pore structure in bread is 99% interconnected into one large vacuole, thus the closed-cell foam of the moist dough is transformed into an open cell solid foam in the bread. The unique property of gas-liquid foams having very high specific surface area is exploited in the chemical processes of froth flotation and foam fractionation. = Solid foams = Solid foams are a class of lightweight cellular engineering materials. These foams are typically classified into two types based on their pore structure: open- cell-structured foams (also known as reticulated foams) and closed-cell foams. At high enough cell resolutions, any type can be treated as continuous or \\"continuum\\" materials and are referred to as cellular solids, with predictable mechanical properties. Open-cell-structured foams contain pores that are connected to each other and form an interconnected network that is relatively soft. Open-cell foams fill with whatever gas surrounds them. If filled with air, a relatively good insulator results, but, if the open cells fill with water, insulation properties would be reduced. Recent studies have put the focus on studying the properties of open-cell foams as an insulator material. Wheat gluten/TEOS bio-foams have been produced, showing similar insulator properties as for those foams obtained from oil-based resources. Foam rubber is a type of open-cell foam. Closed-cell foams do not have interconnected pores. The closed-cell foams normally have higher compressive strength due to their structures. However, closed-cell foams are also, in general more dense, require more material, and as a consequence are more expensive to produce. The closed cells can be filled with a specialized gas to provide improved insulation. The closed-cell structure foams have higher dimensional stability, low moisture absorption coefficients, and higher strength compared to open- cell-structured foams. All types of foam are widely used as core material in sandwich-structured composite materials. The earliest known engineering use of cellular solids is with wood, which in its dry form is a closed-cell foam composed of lignin, cellulose, and air. From the early 20th century, various types of specially manufactured solid foams came into use. The low density of these foams makes them excellent as thermal insulators and flotation devices and their lightness and compressibility make them ideal as packing materials and stuffings. An example of the use of azodicarbonamide as a blowing agent is found in the manufacture of vinyl (PVC) and EVA-PE foams, where it plays a role in the formation of air bubbles by breaking down into gas at high temperature.. The random or \\"stochastic\\" geometry of these foams makes them good for energy absorption, as well. In the late 20th century to early 21st century, new manufacturing techniques have allowed for geometry that results in excellent strength and stiffness per weight. These new materials are typically referred to as engineered cellular solids. = Syntactic foam = A special class of closed-cell foams, known as syntactic foam, contains hollow particles embedded in a matrix material. The spheres can be made from several materials, including glass, ceramic, and polymers. The advantage of syntactic foams is that they have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal materials for many applications, including deep-sea and space applications. One particular syntactic foam employs shape memory polymer as its matrix, enabling the foam to take on the characteristics of shape memory resins and composite materials; i.e., it has the ability to be reshaped repeatedly when heated above a certain temperature and cooled. Shape memory foams have many possible applications, such as dynamic structural support, flexible foam core, and expandable foam fill. = Integral skin foam = Integral skin foam, also known as self-skin foam, is a type of foam with a high-density skin and a low-density core. It can be formed in an open-mold process or a closed-mold process. In the open-mold process, two reactive components are mixed and poured into an open mold. The mold is then closed and the mixture is allowed to expand and cure. Examples of items produced using this process include arm rests, baby seats, shoe soles, and mattresses. The closed-mold process, more commonly known as reaction injection molding (RIM), injects the mixed components into a closed mold under high pressures.  Defoaming  Foam, in this case meaning \\"bubbly liquid\\", is also produced as an often-unwanted by-product in the manufacture of various substances. For example, foam is a serious problem in the chemical industry, especially for biochemical processes. Many biological substances, for example proteins, easily create foam on agitation or aeration. Foam is a problem because it alters the liquid flow and blocks oxygen transfer from air (thereby preventing microbial respiration in aerobic fermentation processes). For this reason, anti-foaming agents, like silicone oils, are added to prevent these problems. Chemical methods of foam control are not always desired with respect to the problems (i.e., contamination, reduction of mass transfer) they may cause especially in food and pharmaceutical industries, where the product quality is of great importance. Mechanical methods to prevent foam formation are more common than chemical ones.  Speed of sound  The acoustical property of the speed of sound through a foam is of interest when analyzing failures of hydraulic components. The analysis involves calculating total hydraulic cycles to fatigue failure. The speed of sound in a foam is determined by the mechanical properties of the gas creating the foam: oxygen, nitrogen, or combinations. Assuming that the speed of sound is based on the liquid's fluid properties leads to errors in calculating fatigue cycles and failure of mechanical hydraulic components. Using acoustical transducers and related instrumentation that set low limits (0‚Äì50,000 Hz with roll-off) causes errors. The low roll-off during measurement of actual frequency of acoustic cycles results in miscalculation due to actual hydraulic cycles in the possible ranges of 1‚Äì1000 MHz or higher. Instrumentation systems are most revealing when cycle bandwidths exceed the actual measured cycles by a factor of 10 to 100. Associated instrumentation costs also increase by factors of 10 to 100. Most moving hydro-mechanical components cycle at 0‚Äì50 Hz, but entrained gas bubbles resulting in a foamy condition of the associated hydraulic fluid results in actual hydraulic cycles that can exceed 1000 MHz even if the moving mechanical components do not cycle at the higher cycle frequency.

He was known as an outstanding speaker and an advocate of universal Christian suffrage. Called today \\"the Father of Connecticut\\", Rev. Thomas Hooker was a towering figure in the early development of colonial New England. He was one of the great preachers of his time, an erudite writer on Christian subjects, the first minister of Cambridge, Massachusetts, one of the first settlers and founders of both the city of Hartford and the state of Connecticut, and cited by many as the inspiration for the \\"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\\", which some have called the world's first written democratic constitution establishing a representative government.Following the Rev. Hooker's sermon in which he declared, \\"The foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people\\", the Fundamental Orders were adopted by the colony of Connecticut on January 14, 1639 (by New Style reckoning). While some modern historians dispute the claim that this was the first constitution in the western democratic tradition, neither the Mayflower Compact nor the Narragansett communities agreements established any forms of government. Furthermore, former Connecticut Chief Justice Simeon E. Baldwin upheld the claim in Norris Osborn's History of Connecticut in Monographic Form, declaring that \\"never had a company of men deliberately met to frame a social compact for immediate use, constituting a new and independent commonwealth, with definite officers, executive and legislative, and prescribed rules and modes of government, until the first planters of Connecticut came together for their great work on January 14th, 1638‚Äì9.\\" Drafted primarily by Roger Ludlow, it was clearly the first compact between a government and the people to uphold the Rev. Hooker‚Äôs proclamation that the foundation of constitutional authority was with the people.

Life Cuckoos Farm, Little Baddow, Essex, Hooker's home around 1629 Thomas Hooker was likely born in Leicestershire at \\"Marfield\\" (Marefield or possibly Markfield) or Birstall. He went to Dixie Grammar School at Market Bosworth. Family genealogist Edward Hooker linked Thomas Hooker to the Hooker family in Devon which produced the theologian and clergyman Richard Hooker. Other Hooker genealogists, however, have traced Thomas Hooker to Leicestershire. Positive evidence linking Thomas to Leicestershire is lacking since the Marefield parish records from before 1610 perished. Any link to the Rev. Richard is likewise lacking since the Rev. Thomas's personal papers were disposed of and his house destroyed after his death.Hooker, Edward, \\"The Origin and Ancestry of Rev.

Thomas Hooker In March 1604, he entered Queens' College, Cambridge as a sizar but migrated to Emmanuel College. He received his Bachelor of Arts in 1608 and his Master of Arts in 1611. In 1609 he was elected to a Dixie fellowship at Emmanuel. Hooker was appointed to St George's Church, Esher, Surrey in 1620, where he earned a reputation as an excellent speaker and became noted for his pastoral care of Mrs. Joan Drake, the wife of the patron. She was a depressive whose stages of spiritual regeneration became a model for his later theological thinking. While associated with the Drake household, he married Susannah Garbrand, Mrs. Drake's woman-in-waiting (April 3, 1621) in Amersham, Mrs. Drake's birthplace.Thomas Hooker, Writings in England and Holland, 1626‚Äì1633. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1975), p.7. Around 1626, Hooker became a lecturer or preacher at what was then St. Mary's parish church, Chelmsford (now Chelmsford Cathedral) and curate to its rector, John Michaelson. However, in 1629 Archbishop William Laud suppressed church lecturers, and Hooker retired to Little Baddow where he kept a school. His leadership of Puritan sympathizers brought him a summons to the Court of High Commission. Forfeiting his bond, Hooker fled to Rotterdam in the Netherlands, and considered a position in the English Reformed Church, Amsterdam, as assistant to its senior pastor, the Rev. John Paget.Thomas Hooker, Writings in England and Holland, 1626‚Äì1633. (Cambridge, MA: Harvard Univ. Press, 1975), p.25.

Hooker arrived in Boston and settled in Newtown (later renamed Cambridge), where he became the pastor of the earliest established church there, known to its members as \\"The Church of Christ at Cambridge.\\"Records of the Church of Christ at Cambridge in New England: 1632‚Äì1830, Boston, MA: Putnam, 1906).

Hooker and Company Journeying through the Wilderness from Plymouth to Hartford, in 1636, Frederic Edwin Church, 1846 Voting in Massachusetts was limited to freemen, individuals who had been formally admitted to their church after a detailed interrogation of their religious views and experiences. Hooker disagreed with this limitation of suffrage, putting him at odds with the influential pastor John Cotton. Owing to his conflict with Cotton and discontented with the suppression of Puritan suffrage and at odds with the colony leadership, Hooker and the Rev. Samuel Stone led a group of about 100 who, in 1636, founded the settlement of Hartford, named for Stone's place of birth, Hertford in England.Walker, George Leon, Thomas Hooker: Preacher, Founder, Democrat (Dodd, Mead and Company, 1891), p. 97; Allen, Morse S., & Arthur H.

This led to the founding of the Connecticut Colony. Hooker became more active in politics in Connecticut. The General Court representing Wethersfield, Windsor and Hartford met at the end of May 1638 to frame a written constitution in order to establish a government for the commonwealth. Hooker preached the opening sermon at First Church of Hartford on May 31, declaring that \\"the foundation of authority is laid in the free consent of the people.\\"Hooker, Thomas, Lecture delivered at the First Church, Hartford, Connecticut, on May 31, 1638, quoted in Walker, George Leon, Thomas Hooker: Preacher, Founder, Democrat, p. 125; and Trumbull, Benjamin, A Complete History of Connecticut, Vol. I (Maltby, Goldsmith and Co., and Samuel Wadsworth, 1818, and Arno Press, 1972), pp. 20‚Äì21. On January 14, 1639, freemen from these three settlements ratified the \\"Fundamental Orders of Connecticut\\" in what John Fiske called \\"the first written constitution known to history that created a government. It marked the beginnings of American democracy, of which Thomas Hooker deserves more than any other man to be called the father. The government of the United States today is in lineal descent more nearly related to that of Connecticut than to that of any of the other thirteen colonies.\\"Fiske, John, Beginnings of New England, or the Puritan Theocracy in Its Relation to Civil and Religious Liberty (Houghton Mifflin Company, the Riverside Press, Cambridge, 1889), pp. 127‚Äì28. In recognition of this, near Chelmsford Cathedral, Essex, England, where he was town lecturer and curate, there is a blue plaque fixed high on the wall of a narrow alleyway, opposite the south porch, that reads: \\"Thomas Hooker, 1586‚Äì1647, Curate at St. Mary's Church and Chelmsford Town Lecturer 1626‚Äì29.

Hooker died during an \\"epidemical sickness\\" in 1647, at the age of 61. The location of his grave is unknown, although he is believed to be buried in Hartford's Ancient Burying Ground where there is a crypt right now, there also is a plaque on the back of the church as well. Because there was no known portrait of him, the statue of him that stands nearby, in front of Hartford's Old State House, was sculpted from the likenesses of his descendants. However, the city is not without a sense of humor regarding its origins. Each year in October, organizations and citizens of Hartford dress up in outrageous costumes to celebrate Hooker Day with the Hooker Day Parade. T-shirts sold in the Old State House proclaim \\"Hartford was founded by a Hooker.\\"Hartford Courant, \\"Peters Is the Mayor to Lift City's Spirits\\", September 7, 1993, p. B.1; Hartford.com Views First Church of Cambridge, Cambridge, Massachusetts Thomas Hooker strongly advocated extended suffrage to include Puritan worshippers, a view which would lead him and his followers to colonize Connecticut. He also promoted the concept of a government that must answer to the people, stating: \\"[T]hey who have the power to appoint officers and magistrates, it is in their power, also, to set the bounds and limitations of the power and place unto which they call them\\" through \\"the privilege of election, which belongs to the people according to the blessed will and law of God\\". Thomas Hooker argued for greater religious tolerance towards all Christian denominations. Hooker defended the calling of synods by magistrates, and attended a convention of ministers in Boston whose purpose was to defend Congregationalism. Hooker later published A Survey of the Summed of Church- Discipline in defense of Congregationalism, and applied its principles to politics and government. Thomas Hooker was a prominent proponent of the doctrine of preparationism, which taught that by making use of the means of grace, a \\"person seeking conversion might dispose himself toward receiving God's grace.\\" He believed that much of God's favor needed to be re-earned by men. To Hooker, sin was the most crafty of enemies, defeating grace on most occasions. He disagreed with many of the predecessor theologies of Free Grace theology, preferring a more muted view on the subject. He focused on preparation for heaven and following the moralist character. Family House of Thomas Hooker, Hartford, Connecticut Thomas Hooker came to the colonies with his second wife, Suzanne. Nothing is known of his first wife. His son Samuel, likely born at Cambridge, Massachusetts, graduated from Harvard College in 1653. He became minister of Farmington, Connecticut, where his descendants lived for many generations.Married to the eldest daughter of Capt. Thomas Willett of Plymouth Colony, a Plymouth merchant and later first mayor of New York City, Rev. Samuel Hooker was the progenitor of all Hookers who claim descent from Rev. Thomas Hooker of Connecticut. Of Rev. Samuel Hooker, Cotton Mather wrote in Magnalia Christi Americana: \\"Thus we have to this day among us our dead Hooker, yet living in his worthy son Samuel Hooker, an able, faithful, useful minister at Farmington, in the Colony of Connecticut.\\" His daughter Mary married Rev. Roger Newton who was a founder and first minister of Farmington, Connecticut. He later went on to be minister in Milford, Connecticut. John Hooker, son of Rev. Samuel and grandson of Rev. Thomas, served as Speaker of the Connecticut Assembly, and previously as Judge of the state supreme court. James Hooker, brother of John and son of Rev. Samuel, also became a prominent political figure in Connecticut. He married the daughter of William Leete of Guilford, Connecticut, and subsequently settled there. James Hooker served as the first probate judge, and later as speaker of the Connecticut colonial assembly. Rev. Thomas's granddaughter Mary Hooker, the daughter of Rev. Samuel, married the Rev. James Pierpont. Their daughter Sarah Pierpont married the Rev. Jonathan Edwards. Other descendants of Thomas Hooker include Henry Hooker, John Hooker, Arthur Atterbury, Charles Atterbury Mary Hooker Pierpont, William Howard Taft, Timothy Dwight V, Aaron Burr, William Gillette, William Huntington Russell, Edward H.

Genesis narrative In , Tamar is first described as marrying Judah's eldest son, Er. Because of his wickedness, Er was killed by God.Dancy, J. The Divine Drama: the Old Testament as Literature, , 2002, p. 92 By way of a Levirate union, Judah asked his second son, Onan, to provide offspring for Tamar so that the family line might continue. This could have substantial economic repercussions, with any son born deemed the heir of the deceased Er, and able to claim the firstborn's double share of inheritance. However, if Er was childless, Onan would inherit as the oldest surviving son.Frymer-Kensky, Tikva. \\"Tamar: Bible\\", Jewish Women: A Comprehensive Historical Encyclopedia. 20 March 2009. Jewish Women's Archive. (Viewed on August 6, 2014) Onan performed coitus interruptus. His action was deemed wicked by God and so, like his older brother, God killed him. At this point, Judah is portrayed as viewing Tamar to be cursed and therefore as being reluctant to give her his remaining and youngest son Shelah. Rather, he tells Tamar to wait for Shelah. However, even after Shelah has grown up, Judah still does not give Tamar to him in marriage. () =Tamar and Judah= Judah and Tamar, Horace Vernet After Shelah had grown up, Judah became a widower. After Judah mourned the death of his wife, he planned on going to Timnath to shear his sheep. Upon hearing this news, Tamar disguised herself as a prostitute and immediately went to Timnath which was en route to Judah's destination. Upon arriving at a place near Timnath, where two roads met,In the Hebrew text, Tamar is said to have sat down \\"at the entrance of Enaim,\\" explained by various commentators to either mean a juncture of two roads (Aramaic Targum), or else a place by that name (Commentator), or else in an open-place where all eyes could gaze upon her (Midrash). Judah saw the woman but did not recognize her as Tamar because of the veil she wore over her face. Thinking she was a prostitute, he requested her services. Tamar's plan was to become pregnant by this ruse so that she might bear a child in Judah's line, since Judah had not given her to his son Shelah. So she played the part of a prostitute and struck a bargain with Judah for a goat, secured by his staff, seal, and cord. When Judah was able to have a goat sent to Timnath, in order to collect his staff and seal, the woman was nowhere to be found and no one knew of any prostitute in Timnath. () Three months later, Tamar was accused of prostitution on account of her pregnancy. Upon hearing this news, Judah ordered that she be burned to death. Tamar sent the staff, seal, and cord to Judah with a message declaring that the owner of these items was the man who had made her pregnant. Upon recognizing these items as his security, Judah released Tamar from her sentence. Tamar, having thus secured her place in the family as well as Judah's posterity, gave birth to twins, Perez and Zerah. Their birth is reminiscent of the birth of Rebekah's twin sons. The midwife marks Zerah's hand with a scarlet cord when he emerges first from the womb, though Perez is born first. Perez is identified in the Book of Ruth as the ancestor of King David. () The Genesis narrative also makes a note that Judah did not have further sexual relations with Tamar. () According to Ethiopic tradition, Perez became the king of Persia.Kebra Negast, Ethiopian Book of the Kings' Glory, chapter 77. Narrative criticism Literary critics have focused on the relationship between the Judah story in chapter 38 and the Joseph story in chapters 37 and 39. Victor P. Hamilton notes some \\"intentional literary parallels\\" between the chapters, such as the exhortation to \\"identify\\" (38:25‚Äì26 and 37:32‚Äì33).Victor P. Hamilton, The Book of Genesis, Chapters 18‚Äì50 (NICOT; Eerdmans, 1995), 431‚Äì432. John Emerton regards the connections as evidence for including chapter 38 in the J corpus, and suggests that the J writer dovetailed the Joseph and Judah traditions.J. A. Emerton, \\"Some problems,‚Äù 349. Emerton also suggests (p. 360) that in J, this story ‚Äúnever stood anywhere but between the accounts of the selling of Joseph into slavery and the doings of Joseph in Egypt.‚Äù Derek Kidner points out that the insertion of chapter 38 \\"creates suspense for the reader\\",Derek Kidner, Genesis: An Introduction and Commentary (IVP, 2008 ), 187. but Robert Alter goes further and suggests it is a result of the \\"brilliant splicing of sources by a literary artist.\\" He notes that the same verb \\"identify‚Äù will play \\"a crucial thematic role in the d√©nouement of the Joseph story when he confronts his brothers in Egypt, he recognizing them, they failing to recognize him.\\"Robert Alter, The Art of Biblical Narrative (Basic Books, 1981), 10. J. A. Emerton also suggests that the Judah and Tamar narrative contains \\"aetiological motifs concerned with the eponymous ancestors of the clans of Judah.'J. A. Emerton, \\"Judah and Tamar\\", Vetus Testamentum 29 [1979], 405. Emerton notes that Dillman and Noth considered the account of the deaths of Er and Onan to \\"reflect the dying out of two clans of Judah bearing their names, or at least of their failure to maintain a separate existence.\\" However, this view was \\"trenchantly criticized\\" by Thomas L. Thompson. =Jewish views= Aert de Gelder, Tamar and Judah, 1667 According to the Talmud, Judah's confession of guilt itself atoned for some of his prior faults, and resulted in his being divinely rewarded by a share in the future world. Sotah 7b The Talmud also suggests that Tamar's actions were for the purpose of avoiding Judah's humiliation,Berakot 43a Sotah 12b although the Genesis Rabbah portrays her as boastful and unashamed in regard to the pregnancy itself.Genesis Rabbah 85:11 Both the Genesis Rabbah and Talmud state that Tamar was an Israelite,Genesis Rabbah 85:9Sotah 10a and that Judah ended up marrying her and had further sexual liaisons with her as a result.Sotah 10b Frymer-Kensky finds Tamar's traits of assertiveness in action, willingness to be unconventional, and deep loyalty to family to be qualities that distinguish her descendant, King David. According to Legends of the Jews, Tamar was endowed with a prophetic gift which allowed her to know the future of her descendants. From this gift, she knew that she would be the ancestress of royal line of David and mighty prophets. While she was standing in gate of Timnah and wearing a veil; Judah, who was intoxicated from wine that twisted his understanding away,Ginzberg, Louis (1909).

After that, he left her with three symbolical pledges; his staff, the stay of Tribe of Judah; his mantle, representation of his strength; and his signet-diadem, the glory of kingdom of Judah.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Volume II: Judah and His Sons (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. When her state became known, Tamar was dragged before the court, in which Isaac, Jacob, and Judah as the judges. As a judge, Judah gave a decision that Tamar was liable to the death penalty by burning according to the law, for she was the daughter of the high priest (Shem) who was accused of leading an unchaste demeanor. After Tamar showed the three pledges from the man who came to her, Judah's countenance grew pale to green color when he publicly confessed his relationship with her.Ginzberg, Louis (1909). The Legends of the Jews Volume III: The Stones in the Breastplate (Translated by Henrietta Szold) Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society. =Christian views= According to the Gospel of Matthew, Judah and Tamar are ancestors of Jesus through their son Perez. () Chronological issues Together with the brief preceding narrative of the birth of Er, Onan, and Shelah, and the subsequent narrative of the birth of Perez's children, the passage is often regarded as presenting a significant chronological issue, since it is surrounded by a narrative concerning Joseph; before the passage occurs, Joseph is described as being 17 years old, and after the passage, Joseph is described as meeting up with Judah some 9 years after Joseph had reached 30 years in age. The gap, a maximum of 22 years, is somewhat small to contain within it Judah's first marriage, the birth of Er and Onan, Er's marriage to Tamar, Tamar's subsequent pregnancy by Judah, and the birth of Judah's children (Judah was the father and his daughter-in-law, Tamar, was the mother); the passage is also widely regarded as an abrupt change to the surrounding narrative Joseph story. According to some textual scholars, the reason for these features is that the passage derives from the Jahwist source, while the immediately surrounding narrative is from the Elohist, the two being spliced together at a later date.Cheyne and Black, Encyclopedia BiblicaJewish EncyclopediaRichard Elliott Friedman, Who wrote the Bible?

It is a triglyceride derived from three units of stearic acid. Most triglycerides are derived from at least two and more commonly three different fatty acids. Like other triglycerides, stearin can crystallise in three polymorphs. For stearin, these melt at 54 (Œ±-form), 65, and (Œ≤-form). Note that stearin is also used to mean the solid component of an oil or fat that can be separated into components that melt at higher (the stearin) and lower (the olein) temperatures. This is the usage meant in an example such as palm stearin.  Occurrence  Stearin is obtained from animal fats created as a byproduct of processing beef. It can also be found in tropical plants such as palm. It can be partially purified by dry fractionation by pressing tallow or other fatty mixtures, leading to separation of the higher melting stearin-rich material from the liquid, which is typically enriched in fats derived from oleic acid. It can be obtained by interesterification, again exploiting its higher melting point which allows the higher melting tristearin to be removed from the equilibrated mixture. Stearin is a side product obtained during the extraction of cod liver oil removed during the chilling process at temperatures below .  Uses  It is used as a hardening agent in the manufacture of candles and soap. In the manufacture of soap, stearin is mixed with a sodium hydroxide solution in water.

The future Space Launch System (SLS) will also be assembled there. At it is one of the largest buildings in the world by volume. The building is at Launch Complex 39 at KSC, halfway between Jacksonville and Miami, and due east of Orlando on Merritt Island on the Atlantic coast of Florida. The VAB is the largest single-story building in the world, was the tallest building () in Florida until 1974, and is still the tallest building in the United States outside an urban area. History The VAB, which was completed in 1966, was originally built to allow for the vertical assembly of the Saturn V rocket for the Apollo program and referred to as the Vertical Assembly Building. In anticipation of post-Saturn projects such as the Space Shuttle program, it was renamed the Vehicle Assembly Building in 1965, and was used for the Shuttle's external fuel tanks and flight hardware, and to mate the Space Shuttle orbiters to their solid rocket boosters and external fuel tanks. Once assembled, the complete Space Shuttle was moved on the mobile launcher platform and crawler-transporter to LC-39A or LC-39B. Sometime prior to the destruction of in 2003, NASA installed a sub-roof inside the VAB to deal with falling concrete debris as a result of the building's age. Construction Mobile Launchers for the Saturn V rocket. In 1963, NASA contracted the Morrison-Knudsen company to design and build the VAB. Construction began with driving the first steel foundation piles on Aug. 2, 1963. It was part of NASA's massive effort to send astronauts to the Moon for the Apollo program. Altogether, 4,225 pilings were driven down 164 feet to bedrock with a foundation consisting of of concrete.

Despite this, it has received damage from several hurricanes (see below). Capabilities Discovery toward the ET and SRBs in high bay 3 of the Vehicle Assembly Building for STS-124. There are four entries to the bays located inside the building, which are the four largest doors in the world. Each door is high, has 7 vertical panels and 4 horizontal panels, and takes 45 minutes to completely open or close. The north entry that leads to the transfer aisle was widened by to allow entry of the shuttle orbiter. A central slot at the north entry allowed for passage of the orbiter's vertical stabilizer. To lift the components of the Space Shuttle, the VAB housed five overhead bridge cranes, including two capable of lifting 325 tons, and 136 other lifting devices. The building has at least 40 MW of air conditioning equipment, including 125 ventilators on the roof supported by four large air handlers (four cylindrical structures west of the building) to keep moisture under control. Air in the building can be completely replaced every hour. The interior volume of the building is so vast that it has its own weather, including \\"rain clouds form[ing] below the ceiling on very humid days\\", which the moisture reduction systems are designed to minimize. Exterior Bicentennial Star opposite the flag. The Bicentennial Star was painted over with the NASA insignia in 1998. Note the Space Shuttle Landing Facility at upper left. The American flag painted on the building was the largest in the world when added in 1976 as part of United States Bicentennial celebrations, along with the star logo of the anniversary, later replaced by the NASA insignia in 1998. It is high, and wide. Each of the stars on the flag is across, the blue field is the size of a regulation basketball court, and each of the stripes is wide. Work began in early 2007 to restore the exterior paint on the immense facility. Special attention was paid to the enormous American flag and NASA \\"meatball\\" insignia. The work repaired visible damage from years of storms and weathering. The flag and logo had been previously repainted in 1998 for NASA's 40th anniversary. Repair work after Hurricane Frances The most extensive exterior damage occurred during the storm season of 2004, when Hurricane Frances blew off 850 aluminum panels from the building, resulting in about of new openings in the sides. Twenty-five additional panels were blown off the east side by the winds from Hurricane Jeanne just three weeks later. Earlier in the season, Hurricane Charley caused significant but less serious damage, estimated to cost $700,000. Damage caused by these hurricanes was still visible in 2007. Some of these panels are \\"punch-outs\\", designed to detach from the VAB when a large pressure differential is created on the outside vs. the inside. This allows for equalization, and helps protect the structural integrity of the building during rapid changes in pressure such as in tropical cyclones.

These tours were temporarily discontinued in February 2014 to allow for renovations to take place.Rocket Renovations Will End Public Tours of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building The NASA FY2013 budget included US$143.7 million for Construction of Facilities (CoF) requirements in support of Artemis program vehicles including Space Launch System (SLS) and Orion spacecraft. NASA began modifying Launch Complex 39 at KSC to support the new SLS in 2014, beginning with major repairs, code upgrades and safety improvements to the Launch Control Center, Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and the VAB Utility Annex. This initial work will be required to support any launch vehicle operated from Launch Complex 39 and will allow NASA to begin modernizing the facilities, while vehicle-specific requirements are being developed.NASA FY13 Budget The VAB could be used to some extent for assembly and processing of any future vehicles utilizing Launch Complex 39, in addition to renovations for SLS capabilities.

It was a hub for Continental Airlines, the original Frontier Airlines, People Express, United Airlines, and Western Airlines. Other airlines with smaller operations at Stapleton included Aspen Airways, the current version of Frontier Airlines, and Rocky Mountain Airways, all three being based in Denver at the time.http://www.departedflights.com, February 15, 1985 Aspen Airways route map; January 16, 1995 Frontier Airlines route map; December 13, 1985 Rocky Mountain Airways route map Stapleton airport was replaced by Denver International Airport in 1995; it was closed and the property redeveloped as a commercial and residential neighborhood. History Looking west, January 1966. Only concourses A, B, and C existed then. A United Airlines Pilot Training Center was later built on the vacant land between the airport's west boundary and the housing tracts. Looking north, January 1966. Runway 35 became 35L, after 35R was built. The old United Airlines pilot training center buildings, on the airport proper, were still in operation. A UAL DC-8 pilot training flight has just made a missed approach, complete with its shadow. = Prewar and wartime years (1929‚Äì1945) = Stapleton opened in 1929 as Denver Municipal Airport on October 17. The development of the airport was spearheaded by Denver mayor Benjamin F. Stapleton and Improvements and Parks Department manager Charles Vail. Prior to the new airport's opening, Denver had been served by a number of smaller facilities, including an airstrip along Smith Road in Aurora (first used in 1911), an airfield at 26th Avenue and Oneida Street, Lowry Field near 38th Avenue and Dahlia Street, and Denver Union Airport at 46th Avenue east of Colorado Boulevard. In the late 1930s the facilities consisted of two hangars and a small administration building mainly used for air mail processing. United Airlines and Continental Airlines began service in 1937. The March 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows nine weekday departures: seven United and two Continental. Continental moved its headquarters from El Paso to Denver in October 1937,Kasel, Carol. \\"CONTINENTAL AIRLINES: THE DENVER YEARS.\\" Rocky Mountain News. October 30, 1994.

Retrieved January 24, 2010. The airfield was renamed Stapleton Airfield in 1944, in honor of Mayor Stapleton. =Postwar years (1945‚Äì1978)= Stapleton's modern horseshoe-shaped terminal design was announced in 1946 and promptly shelved by incoming mayor James Newton. The original administration building was extended with new wings in the early 1950s, and replaced entirely in 1954. DC-4 nonstops to Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles began in 1946; DC-6 nonstops to Washington DC began in 1951 and to New York in 1952. Denver then had five airlines: United flew across the country, Continental flew south and east, Braniff flew to Texas, Frontier flew to smaller cities north and south from Denver, and Western connected Denver to Minneapolis and Edmonton. TWA and Central arrived in 1956. The April 1957 OAG shows 38 United departures a day, 12 Continental, seven Braniff, seven Frontier, seven Western, five TWA and one Central. The jet age arrived in May 1959 when Continental began operating Boeing 707s to Stapleton, initially under weight restrictions due to Stapleton's runway capacity. (Scheduled 707s started in August 1959.) Runway 17/35 and a new terminal building opened in 1964;Runway 17/35 is on the June 1963 sectional chart https://www.loc.gov/resource/g3701pm.gct00089/?sp=1718&r;=0.449,0.061,0.15,0.093,0 runway 17L opened sometime in 1975-80. Stapleton adopted the \\"International\\" name in 1964, but its first nonstop international flight came in 1968, when Western began flights to Calgary. The Boeing 747 was introduced to Stapleton on Continental's Los Angeles route in 1970. In the early 1970s Frontier was in Concourse A, United occupied most of Concourse B, and Western and Continental occupied most of Concourse C. United and TWA served both coasts nonstop, while Continental and Western nonstop flights only extended to the western half of the country. Concourse D was built in 1972. = Post-deregulation (1978‚Äì1985) = After deregulation, Denver's four major airlines developed hubs at Stapleton. United occupied Concourse B, Continental and Western occupied Concourse C and Frontier occupied Concourse D. Western flew nonstop between Denver and London in 1981-82, but then shifted resources to Salt Lake City and Los Angeles; Denver had ceased to be a Western hub by the time Delta acquired them in 1987. In 1983 Arrow Air introduced brief transatlantic services to London and Manchester, and Condor flew a weekly charter to Frankfurt, Germany. Southwest Airlines and People Express tried low-cost service to Denver in the mid-1980s, but Southwest withdrew and People Express was acquired by Continental. In September 1982 the first revenue flight of the Boeing 767 arrived at Stapleton, a United flight from O'Hare International Airport in Chicago. During the energy boom of the early 1980s, several skyscrapers were built in downtown Denver, including Republic Plaza (Denver's tallest at 714‚Ä≤). Due to Stapleton's location east of downtown, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a building height restriction of 700'-715' (depending on where the building was). This allowed an unimpeded glide slope for runways (8L/26R) and (8R/26L). The height restriction was lifted in 1995, well after the city's skyscrapers had been erected. =Decommissioning (1985‚Äì1995)= Two Convair 580s of the Denver-based Aspen Airways at Stapleton in 1986By the 1980s, plans were under way to replace Stapleton, which had a number of problems, including: * inadequate separation between runways, leading to long waits in bad weather * little or no room for other airlines that proposed/wanted to use Stapleton for new destinations (one such example was Southwest Airlines) * a lawsuit over aircraft noise, brought by residents of the nearby Park Hill community * legal threats by Adams County, to block a runway extension into Rocky Mountain Arsenal lands The Colorado General Assembly brokered a deal in 1985 to annex a plot of land in Adams County into the city of Denver, and use that land to build a new airport. Adams County voters approved the plan in 1988, and Denver voters approved the plan in a 1989 referendum. Interstate 70 at its midpoint. To combat congestion, runway 18/36 was added in the 1980s and the terminal was again expanded with the $250 million (or $58 million according to the New York Times) 24 gate Concourse E opening in 1988, despite Denver's replacement airport already being under construction. By the early 1990s, Concourses A and B were exclusively used by United and United Express, Continental used most of Concourses C and D, and most other airlines moved to Concourse E. In the early 1990s, several charter services to the United Kingdom were introduced, and Martinair inaugurated services to Amsterdam up until Stapleton's closure. Continental closed its Stapleton pilot and flight attendant bases in October 1994, reducing operations and making United the airport's largest carrier. Delta Flight 569 from Dallas/Ft.Worth was the last airline flight to land at Stapleton. On February 27, 1995, air traffic controller George Hosford cleared the last plane ‚Äì Continental Flight 34, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 bound for London‚Ä≤s Gatwick Airport ‚Äì to depart from Stapleton. The airport was then shut down, marking the end of 65 years of service. A convoy of ground service equipment and other vehicles (rental cars, baggage carts, fuel trucks, etc.) traveled to the new Denver International Airport (DEN), which opened the following morning. = Post-closure redevelopment = Control tower at Stapleton photographed from top level of close-in parking structure, 1995Former Stapleton International Airport (February 6, 2006) When it closed in 1995, Stapleton had six runways (two sets of three parallel runways) and five terminal concourses. The runways at Stapleton were then marked with large yellow \\"X\\"s, which indicated it was no longer legal or safe for any aircraft to land there. The IATA and ICAO airport codes of DEN and KDEN were then transferred to the new DIA, to coincide with the same changes in airline and ATC computers, to ensure that flights to Denver would land at the new DIA. While Denver International was being built, planners began to consider how the Stapleton site would be redeveloped. A private group of Denver civic leaders, the Stapleton Development Foundation, convened in 1990 and produced a master plan for the site in 1995, emphasizing a pedestrian-oriented design rather than the automobile-oriented designs found in many other planned developments. Denver sought tenants for Stapleton's terminal and concourses, but these buildings proved ill-suited for alternative uses. A July 1997 hailstorm punched roughly 4,000 holes in the roofs of the old terminal and concourses, causing severe water damage, which compelled the city to tear them down. The airport's 12-story control tower was retained and served for a time as part of the new Punch Bowl Social, a restaurant and social gathering spot. The office building attached to the tower housed the kitchens and social areas; the tower is closed to public access but is available for private tours. All of Stapleton's airport infrastructure has been removed, except for the control tower. The final parking structure was torn down to make room for the \\"Central Park West\\" section of the housing development in May 2011. DIA still owns some land at the former Stapleton site, an open field area bordered by Central Park Blvd. to the west, 40th Ave. to the North, Havana St. to the East, and 37th Ave. to the south, with the exception of the Coca-Cola and FedEx warehouses. The City's Department of Aviation has continuously owned this site even after Stapleton was closed and decommissioned. Facilities UAL Douglas DC-6 N37514 on the northwest maintenance ramp of Stapleton, September 1966 At the time of its decommissioning, the airport covered and had six runways: * 17R/35L (11,500 ft), concrete * 17L/35R (12,000 ft), concrete * 8L/26R (8,599 ft), concrete * 8R/26L (10,004 ft), concrete * 7/25 (4,871 ft), concrete * 18/36 (7,750 ft), asphalt The terminal had five concourses: * Concourse A ‚Äì Commuter flights, Mesa Air Group, United Airlines * Concourse B ‚Äì United Airlines * Concourse C ‚Äì Continental Airlines, Mexicana Airlines, Martinair, Condor * Concourse D ‚Äì Continental Express, Delta Air Lines, MarkAir, Pan American World Airways, Trans World Airlines, Frontier Airlines, * Concourse E ‚Äì America West Airlines, American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Sun Country, USAir Accidents and incidents Several major incidents occurred at Stapleton: * On November 1, 1955, United Airlines Flight 629, a Douglas DC-6B bound for Portland, Oregon, was blown up with a dynamite bomb placed in the checked luggage by Jack Gilbert Graham. It crashed near Longmont, Colorado, killing all 44 on board. * On July 11, 1961, United Airlines Flight 859, a DC-8-12 (tail number N8040U) veered off the runway on landing. Asymmetric reverse thrust on engines 1 and 2 (left wing) forced a loss of control, causing the aircraft to collide with construction equipment, killing the driver of one vehicle. In the ensuing fire, 17 of the DC-8's 122 occupants died. * On August 7, 1975, Continental Airlines Flight 426, a Boeing 727 bound for Wichita, Kansas, crashed due to windshear after taking off and climbing to on runway 35L. Nobody was killed in the accident. * On November 16, 1976, a Texas International DC-9-10 stalled after takeoff at Stapleton and crashed. Of the 81 passengers and 5 crewmembers, 14 were injured but none died. * On November 15, 1987, Continental Airlines Flight 1713, a DC-9-14 bound for Boise, Idaho, crashed on takeoff at Stapleton during a snowstorm. The probable cause of the crash was loss of control on takeoff due to ice and snow adhering to the aircraft. The aircraft had been de-iced, but spent longer than normal on the ground in moderate snowfall before takeoff due to confusion about its location. This aircraft accident led to significant changes in aircraft de- icing fluids and flight crew procedures for checking for ice contamination prior to takeoff. Twenty-eight of the plane's 82 occupants were killed. *On September 17, 1988, Continental Express Flight 2063, a Beechcraft 1900 propjet under the control of Captain Orlando Zullo, was forced to make an emergency belly landing at 6:30 p.m. The flight was bound for North Platte when hydraulic issues arose, forcing the aircraft to return to Stapleton. Stapleton spokesman Richard Boulware is quoted saying, \\"It was a perfect landing,\\" \\"the propellers stopped turning when the aircraft was about four feet above the runway,\\" and that \\"the aircraft came to rest exactly on the center line of the runway.\\" Despite the runway not being prepped for the landing with foam, there were no injuries, even minor ones, and the aircraft was operational within a week. The landing gear failed due to an error in the manufacturing process. *On November 25, 1990, a fuel-dispensing facility operated by United and Continental Airlines exploded and burned for over 48 hours, consuming almost three million gallons of fuel. The cause of the explosion and fire was attributed to the failure of bolts holding a pump engine in place near the tanks which allowed fuel to contact and ignite against friction-heated elements of the engine coupler. Numerous factors contributed to the long burn time including weather, a lack of training for this sort of event on the part of local firefighters, and the placement of shutoff valves too close to the burning tanks. After initially planning to let the fire burn itself out, Continental Airlines hired a team of oil well control specialists from Boots & Coots in Texas. Once on the ground, the team took just over 30 minutes to smother the remaining two burning tanks and extinguish the fire. Airport operations were relatively unimpeded during the fire due to the distance of the fuel farm from the main facilities; however, United Airlines operations were disrupted as an alternate fuel source had to be found.

It was written partly in Italian and partly in Latin. After his Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems, the Roman Inquisition had banned the publication of any of Galileo's works, including any he might write in the future. See Galileo affair for further details. After the failure of his initial attempts to publish Two New Sciences in France, Germany, and Poland, it was published by Lodewijk Elzevir who was working in Leiden, South Holland, where the writ of the Inquisition was of less consequence (see House of Elzevir). Fra Fulgenzio Micanzio, the official theologian of the Republic of Venice, had initially offered to help Galileo publish in Venice the new work, but he pointed out that publishing the Two New Sciences in Venice might cause Galileo unnecessary trouble; thus, the book was eventually published in Holland. Galileo did not seem to suffer any harm from the Inquisition for publishing this book since in January 1639, the book reached Rome's bookstores, and all available copies (about fifty) were quickly sold. Discourses was written in a style similar to Dialogues, in which three men (Simplicio, Sagredo, and Salviati) discuss and debate the various questions Galileo is seeking to answer. There is a notable change in the men, however; Simplicio, in particular, is no longer quite as simple-minded, stubborn and Aristotelian as his name implies. His arguments are representative of Galileo's own early beliefs, as Sagredo represents his middle period, and Salviati proposes Galileo's newest models. Introduction The book is divided into four days, each addressing different areas of physics. Galileo dedicates Two New Sciences to Lord Count of Noailles. Figure 1 out of Galileo's Two New Sciences in the First Day section In the First Day, Galileo addressed topics that were discussed in Aristotle's Physics and also the Aristotelian school Mechanics. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The likeness between the topics discussed, specific questions that are hypothesized, and the style and sources throughout give Galileo the backbone to his First Day. The First Day introduces the speakers in the dialogue: Salviati, Sagredo, and Simplicio, the same as in the Dialogue. These three people are all Galileo just at different stages of his life, Simplicio the youngest and Salviati, Galileo's closest counterpart. It also provides an introduction to the discussion of both of the new sciences. The second day addresses the question of the strength of materials. The Third and Fourth days address the science of motion. The Third day discusses uniform and naturally accelerated motion, the issue of terminal velocity having been addressed in the First day. The Fourth day discusses projectile motion. In Two Sciences uniform motion is defined as a motion that, over any equal periods of time, covers equal distance. With the use of the quantifier ‚Ä≥any‚Ä≥, uniformity is introduced and expressed more explicitly than in previous definitions.Plotnitsky, Arkady; Reed, David (1 January 2001). \\"Discourse, Mathematics, Demonstration, and Science in Galileo's Discourses Concerning Two New Sciences\\". Configurations 9 (1): 37‚Äì64. Galileo had started an additional day on the force of percussion, but was not able to complete it to his own satisfaction. This section was referenced frequently in the first four days of discussion. It finally appeared only in the 1718 edition of Galilei's works. and it is often quoted as \\"Sixth Day\\" following the numbering in the 1898 edition. During this additional day Simplicio was replaced by Aproino, a former scholar and assistant of Galileo in Padua. Summary Page numbers at the start of each paragraph are from the 1898 version, presently adopted as standard, and are found in the Crew and Drake translations. =Day one: Resistance of bodies to separation= [50] Preliminary discussions. Sagredo (taken to be the younger Galileo) cannot understand why with machines one cannot argue from the small to the large: \\"I do not see that the properties of circles, triangles and...solid figures should change with their size\\". Salviati (speaking for Galileo) says the common opinion is wrong. Scale matters: a horse falling from a height of 3 or 4 cubits will break its bones whereas a cat falling from twice the height won't, nor will a grasshopper falling from a tower. [56] The first example is a hemp rope which is constructed from small fibres which bind together in the same way as a rope round a windlass to produce something much stronger. Then the vacuum that prevents two highly polished plates from separating even though they slide easily gives rise to an experiment to test whether water can be expanded or whether a vacuum is caused. In fact, Sagredo had observed that a suction pump could not lift more than 18 cubits of water and Salviati observes that the weight of this is the amount of resistance to a void. The discussion turns to the strength of a copper wire and whether there are minute void spaces inside the metal or whether there is some other explanation for its strength. [68] This leads into a discussion of infinites and the continuum and thence to the observation that the number of squares equal the number of roots. He comes eventually to the view that \\"if any number can be said to be infinite, it must be unity\\" and demonstrates a construction in which an infinite circle is approached and another to divide a line. [85] The difference between a fine dust and a liquid leads to a discussion of light and how the concentrated power of the sun can melt metals. He deduces that light has motion and describes an (unsuccessful) attempt to measure its speed. [106] Aristotle believed that bodies fell at a speed proportional to weight but Salviati doubts that Aristotle ever tested this. He also did not believe that motion in a void was possible, but since air is much less dense than water Salviati asserts that in a medium devoid of resistance (a vacuum) all bodies‚Äîa lock of wool or a bit of lead‚Äîwould fall at the same speed. Large and small bodies fall at the same speed through air or water providing they are of the same density. Since ebony weighs a thousand times as much as air (which he had measured), it will fall only a very little more slowly than lead which weighs ten times as much. But shape also matters‚Äîeven a piece of gold leaf (the heaviest of metals) floats through the air and a bladder filled with air falls much more slowly than lead. [128] Measuring the speed of a fall is difficult because of the small time intervals involved and his first way round this used pendulums of the same length but with lead or cork weights. The period of oscillation was the same, even when the cork was swung more widely to compensate for the fact that it soon stopped. [139] This leads to a discussion of the vibration of strings and he suggests that not only the length of the string is important for pitch but also the tension and the weight of the string. =Day two: Cause of cohesion= [151] Salviati proves that a balance can not only be used with equal arms but with unequal arms with weights inversely proportional to the distances from the fulcrum. Following this he shows that the moment of a weight suspended by a beam supported at one end is proportional to the square of the length. The resistance to fracture of beams of various sizes and thicknesses is demonstrated, supported at one or both ends. [169] He shows that animal bones have to be proportionately larger for larger animals and the length of a cylinder that will break under its own weight. He proves that the best place to break a stick placed upon the knee is the middle and shows how far along a beam that a larger weight can be placed without breaking it. [178] He proves that the optimum shape for a beam supported at one end and bearing a load at the other is parabolic. He also shows that hollow cylinders are stronger than solid ones of the same weight. =Day three: Naturally accelerated motion= [191] He first defines uniform (steady) motion and shows the relationship between speed, time and distance. He then defines uniformly accelerated motion where the speed increases by the same amount in increments of time. Falling bodies start very slowly and he sets out to show that their velocity increases in simple proportionality to time, not to distance which he shows is impossible. [208] He shows that the distance travelled in naturally accelerated motion is proportional to the square of the time. He describes an experiment in which a steel ball was rolled down a groove in a piece of wooden moulding 12 cubits long (about 5.5m) with one end raised by one or two cubits. This was repeated, measuring times by accurately weighing the amount of water that came out of a thin pipe in a jet from the bottom of a large jug of water. By this means he was able to verify the uniformly accelerated motion. He then shows that whatever the inclination of the plane, the square of the time taken to fall a given vertical height is proportional to the inclined distance. [221] He next considers descent along the chords of a circle, showing that the time is the same as that falling from the vertex, and various other combinations of planes. He gives an erroneous solution to the brachistochrone problem, claiming to prove that the arc of the circle is the fastest descent. 16 problems with solutions are given. =Day four: The motion of projectiles= Last figure of the Fourth Day of Galileo's Two New Sciences [268] The motion of projectiles consists of a combination of uniform horizontal motion and a naturally accelerated vertical motion which produces a parabolic curve. Two motions at right angles can be calculated using the sum of the squares. He shows in detail how to construct the parabolas in various situations and gives tables for altitude and range depending on the projected angle. [274] Air resistance shows itself in two ways: by affecting less dense bodies more and by offering greater resistance to faster bodies. A lead ball will fall slightly faster than an oak ball, but the difference with a stone ball is negligible. However the speed does not go on increasing indefinitely but reaches a maximum. Though at small speeds the effect of air resistance is small, it is greater when considering, say, a ball fired from a cannon. [292] The effect of a projectile hitting a target is reduced if the target is free to move. The velocity of a moving body can overcome that of a larger body if its speed is proportionately greater than the resistance. [310] A cord or chain stretched out is never level but also approximates to a parabola. (But see also catenary.) =Additional day: The force of percussion= [323] What is the weight of water falling from a bucket hanging on a balance arm onto another bucket suspended to the same arm? [325] Piling of wooden poles for foundations; hammers and the force of percussion. [336] Speed of fall along inclined planes; again on the principle of inertia. Methodology Many contemporary scientists, such as Gassendi, dispute Galileo's methodology for conceptualizing his law of falling bodies. Two of the main arguments are that his epistemology followed the example of Platonist thought or hypothetico- deductivist. It has now been considered to be ex suppositione, or knowing the how and why effects from past events in order to determine the requirements for the production of similar effects in the future. Galilean methodology mirrored that of Aristotelian and Archimedean epistemology. Following a letter from Cardinal Bellarmine in 1615 Galileo distinguished his arguments and Copernicus' as natural suppositions as opposed to the \\"fictive\\" that are \\"introduced only for the sake of astronomical computations,\\" such as Plato's hypothesis on eccentrics and equants. Galileo's earlier writing considered Juvenilia, or youthful writings, are considered his first attempts at creating lecture notes for his course \\"hypothesis of the celestial motions\\" while teaching in at the University of Padua. These notes mirrored those of his contemporaries at the Collegio as well as contained an \\"Aristotelian context with decided Thomistic (St. Thomas Aquinas) overtones.\\" These earlier papers are believed to have encouraged him to apply demonstrative proof in order to give validity to his discoveries on motion. Discovery of folio 116v gives evidence of experiments that had previously not been reported and therefore demonstrated Galileo's actual calculations for the Law of Falling Bodies. His methods of experimentation have been proved by the recording and recreation done by scientists such as James MacLachlan, Stillman Drake, R.H. Taylor and others in order to prove he did not merely imagine his ideas as historian Alexandre Koyr√© argued, but sought to prove them mathematically. Galileo believed that knowledge could be acquired through reason, and reinforced through observation and experimentation. Thus, it can be argued that Galileo was a rationalist, and also that he was an empiricist. The two new sciences The two sciences mentioned in the title are the strength of materials and the motion of objects (the forbearers of modern material engineering and kinematics).Tucker McElroy, A to Z of Mathematicians, Facts on File (Infobase Publishing), p. 109. In the title of the book \\"mechanics\\" and \\"motion\\" are separate, since at Galileo's time \\"mechanics\\" meant only statics and strength of materials.Simon Gindikin, Tales of Physicists and Mathematicians, Springer Science & Business Media, p. 43. =The science of materials= The discussion begins with a demonstration of the reasons that a large structure proportioned in exactly the same way as a smaller one must necessarily be weaker known as the square‚Äìcube law. Later in the discussion this principle is applied to the thickness required of the bones of a large animal, possibly the first quantitative result in biology, anticipating J. B. S. Haldane's work On Being the Right Size, and other essays, edited by John Maynard Smith. =The motion of objects= Galileo expresses clearly for the first time the constant acceleration of a falling body which he was able to measure accurately by slowing it down using an inclined plane. In Two New Sciences, Galileo (Salviati speaks for him) used a wood molding, \\"12 cubits long, half a cubit wide and three finger-breadths thick\\" as a ramp with a straight, smooth, polished groove to study rolling balls (\\"a hard, smooth and very round bronze ball\\"). He lined the groove with \\"parchment, also smooth and polished as possible\\". He inclined the ramp at various angles, effectively slowing down the acceleration enough so that he could measure the elapsed time. He would let the ball roll a known distance down the ramp, and use a water clock to measure the time taken to move the known distance. This clock was > a large vessel of water placed in an elevated position; to the bottom of > this vessel was soldered a pipe of small diameter giving a thin jet of > water, which we collected in a small glass during the time of each descent, > whether for the whole length of the channel or for a part of its length. The > water collected was weighed, and after each descent on a very accurate > balance, the differences and ratios of these weights gave him the > differences and ratios of the times. This was done with such accuracy that > although the operation was repeated many, many times, there was no > appreciable discrepancy in the results.Galileo 1638 Discorsi e dimostrazioni > matematiche, intorno √† due nuove scienze 213, Leida, Appresso gli Elsevirii > (Leiden: Louis Elsevier), or Mathematical discourses and demonstrations, > relating to Two New Sciences, English translation by Henry Crew and Alfonso > de Salvio 1914. Section 213 is reprinted on pages 534-535 of On the > Shoulders of Giants: The Great Works of Physics and Astronomy (works by > Copernicus, Kepler, Galileo, Newton, and Einstein). Stephen Hawking, ed. > 2002 The law of falling bodies While Aristotle had observed that heavier objects fall more quickly than lighter ones, in Two New Sciences Galileo postulated that this was due not to inherently stronger forces acting on the heavier objects, but to the countervailing forces of air resistance and friction. To compensate, he conducted experiments using a shallowly inclined ramp, smoothed so as to eliminate as much friction as possible, on which he rolled down balls of different weights. In this manner, he was able to provide empirical evidence that matter accelerates vertically downward at a constant rate, regardless of mass, due to the effects of gravity.Wallace, William. \\"Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences.\\" (92). The unreported experiment found in folio 116V tested the constant rate of acceleration in falling bodies due to gravity.Wallace, William. \\"Galileo and Reasoning Ex Suppositione: The Methodology of the Two New Sciences.\\" (96). This experiment consisted of dropping a ball from specified heights onto a deflector in order to transfer its motion from vertical to horizontal. The data from the inclined plane experiments were used to calculate the expected horizontal motion. However, discrepancies were found in the results of the experiment: the observed horizontal distances disagreed with the calculated distances expected for a constant rate of acceleration. Galileo attributed the discrepancies to air resistance in the unreported experiment, and friction in the inclined plane experiment. These discrepancies forced Galileo to assert that the postulate held only under \\"ideal conditions,\\" i.e., in the absence of friction and/or air resistance. Bodies in motion Aristotelian physics argued that the Earth must not move as humans are unable to perceive the effects of this motion.Howard Jones. \\"Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion.\\" (224) A popular justification of this is the experiment of an archer shooting an arrow straight up into the air. If the Earth were moving, Aristotle argued, the arrow should fall in a different location than the launch point. Galileo refuted this argument in Two New Sciences. He provided the example of sailors aboard a boat at sea. The boat is obviously in motion, but the sailors are unable to perceive this motion. If a sailor were to drop a weighted object from the mast, this object would fall at the base of the mast rather than behind it (due to the ship's forward motion). This was the result of simultaneously the horizontal and vertical motion of the ship, sailors, and ball. Relativity of motions Picture in Galileo's Discorsi (1638) illustrating relativity of motions One of Galileo's experiments regarding falling bodies was that describing the relativity of motions, explaining that, under the right circumstances, \\"one motion may be superimposed upon another without effect upon either...\\". In Two New Sciences, Galileo made his case for this argument and it would become the basis of Newton's first law, the law of inertia. He poses the question of what happens to a ball dropped from the mast of a sailing ship or an arrow fired into the air on the deck. According to Aristotle's physics, the ball dropped should land at the stern of the ship as it falls straight down from the point of origin. Likewise the arrow when fired straight up should not land in the same spot if the ship is in motion. Galileo offers that there are two independent motions at play. One is the accelerating vertical motion caused by gravity while the other is the uniform horizontal motion caused by the moving ship which continues to influence the trajectory of the ball through the principle of inertia. The combination of these two motions results in a parabolic curve. The observer cannot identify this parabolic curve because the ball and observer share the horizontal movement imparted to them by the ship, meaning only the perpendicular, vertical motion is perceivable. Surprisingly, nobody had tested this theory with the simple experiments needed to gain a conclusive result until Pierre Gassendi published the results of said experiments in his letters entitled De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato (1642). Infinity The book also contains a discussion of infinity. Galileo considers the example of numbers and their squares. He starts by noting that: > It cannot be denied that there are as many [squares] as there are numbers > because every number is a [square] root of some square: 1 ‚Üî 1, 2 ‚Üî 4, 3 ‚Üî 9, > 4 ‚Üî 16, and so on. (In modern language, there is a bijection between the elements of the set of positive integers N and the set of squares S, and S is a proper subset of density zero.) But he notes what appears to be a contradiction: > Yet at the outset we said there are many more numbers than squares, since > the larger portion of them are not squares. Not only so, but the > proportionate number of squares diminishes as we pass to larger numbers. He resolves the contradiction by denying the possibility of comparing infinite numbers (and of comparing infinite and finite numbers): > We can only infer that the totality of all numbers is infinite, that the > number of squares is infinite, and that the number of their roots is > infinite; neither is the number of squares less than the totality of all > numbers, nor the latter greater than the former; and finally the attributes > \\"equal,\\" greater,\\" and \\"less,\\" are not applicable to infinite, but only to > finite, quantities. This conclusion, that ascribing sizes to infinite sets should be ruled impossible, owing to the contradictory results obtained from these two ostensibly natural ways of attempting to do so, is a resolution to the problem that is consistent with, but less powerful than, the methods used in modern mathematics. The resolution to the problem may be generalized by considering Galileo's first definition of what it means for sets to have equal sizes, that is, the ability to put them in one-to-one correspondence. This turns out to yield a way of comparing the sizes of infinite sets that is free from contradictory results. These issues of infinity arise from problems of rolling circles. If two concentric circles of different radii roll along lines, then if the larger does not slip it appears clear that the smaller must slip. But in what way? Galileo attempts to clarify the matter by considering hexagons and then extending to rolling 100 000-gons, or n-gons, where he shows that a finite number of finite slips occur on the inner shape. Eventually, he concludes \\"the line traversed by the larger circle consists then of an infinite number of points which completely fill it; while that which is traced by the smaller circle consists of an infinite number of points which leave empty spaces and only partly fill the line,\\" which would not be considered satisfactory now. Reactions by commentators Part of Two New Sciences was pure mathematics, as has been pointed out by the mathematician Alfr√©d R√©nyi, who said that it was the most significant book on mathematics in over 2000 years: Greek mathematics did not deal with motion, and so they never formulated mathematical laws of motion, even though Archimedes developed differentiation and integration. Two New Sciences opened the way to treating physics mathematically by treating motion mathematically for the first time. The Greek mathematician Zeno had designed his paradoxes to prove that motion could not be treated mathematically, and that any attempt to do so would lead to paradoxes. (He regarded this as an inevitable limitation of mathematics.) Aristotle reinforced this belief, saying that mathematic could only deal with abstract objects that were immutable. Galileo used the very methods of the Greeks to show that motion could indeed be treated mathematically. His idea was to separate out the paradoxes of the infinite from Zeno's paradoxes. He did this in several steps. First, he showed that the infinite sequence S of the squares 1, 4, 9, 16, ...contained as many elements as the sequence N of all positive integers (infinity); this is now referred to as Galileo's paradox. Then, using Greek style geometry, he showed a short line interval contained as many points as a longer interval. At some point he formulates the general principle that a smaller infinite set can have just as many points as a larger infinite set containing it. It was then clear that Zeno's paradoxes on motion resulted entirely from this paradoxical behavior of infinite quantities. Renyi said that, having removed this 2000-year-old stumbling block, Galileo went on to introduce his mathematical laws of motion, anticipating Newton.Alfred Renyi, Dialogs on Mathematics, Holden-Day, San Francisco, 1967. =Gassendi's thoughts= Pierre Gassendi defended Galileo's opinions in his book, De Motu Impresso a Motore Translato. In Howard Jones' article, Gassendi's Defence of Galileo: The Politics of Discretion, Jones says Gassendi displayed an understanding of Galileo's arguments and a clear grasp of their implications for the physical objections to the earth's motion. =Koyr√©'s thoughts= The law of falling bodies was published by Galileo in 1638. But in the 20th century some authorities challenged the reality of Galileo's experiments. In particular, the French historian of science Alexandre Koyr√© bases his doubt on the fact that the experiments reported in Two New Sciences to determine the law of acceleration of falling bodies, required accurate measurements of time which appeared to be impossible with the technology of 1600. According to Koyr√©, the law was created deductively, and the experiments were merely illustrative thought experiments. In fact, Galileo's water clock (described above) provided sufficiently accurate measurements of time to confirm his conjectures. Later research, however, has validated the experiments. The experiments on falling bodies (actually rolling balls) were replicated using the methods described by Galileo, and the precision of the results was consistent with Galileo's report. Later research into Galileo's unpublished working papers from 1604 clearly showed the reality of the experiments and even indicated the particular results that led to the time-squared law.

Origins He was born at Moulsham in Essex, the fourth and youngest son of Thomas Mildmay, later Auditor of the Court of Augmentations under Henry VIII, by his wife Agnes Read. As the Commissioner for receiving the surrender of the monasteries at the Dissolution, his father Thomas made a large fortune and in 1540 acquired the manor of Moulsham, near Chelmsford in Essex, where he built a fine mansion., cites: cf. John Nichols's Progresses of Queen Elizabeth, ii. 287 =Collateral line= Walter's elder brother Sir Thomas Mildmay (d. 1566) of Moulsham, was Auditor of the Court of Augmentations, established in 1537 for allocating the property taken by the Crown from the monasteries.

Harleian Society, 1st ser. 13. London. p.251 Sir Thomas Mildmay was the grandfather of Sir Thomas Mildmay, 1st Baronet (d. 1626), created a baronet in 1611, and of Sir Henry Mildmay (d. 1654), a knight. Henry claimed, in right of his mother Frances Radcliffe, a daughter of Henry Radclyffe, 2nd Earl of Sussex, 3rd Baron FitzWalter (1507‚Äì1557), the barony of FitzWalter, and on 10 February 1670 his grandson Benjamin Mildmay, 17th Baron FitzWalter (c. 1646‚Äì1679), was summoned to the House of Lords by that title. Benjamin's two sons were Charles Mildmay, 18th Baron FitzWalter (1670‚Äì1728) and Benjamin Mildmay, 1st Earl FitzWalter, 1st Viscount Harwich, 19th Baron FitzWalter (1672‚Äì1756), the latter being further created Viscount Harwich and Earl FitzWalter in 1730. On Earl FitzWalter's death in 1756, the earldom became extinct and the barony fell into abeyance., cites: (cf. Burke's Extinct Peerages, p. 368). Career Apethorpe Palace, depicted in 1829, acquired by Mildmay in 1552 Mildmay was educated at Christ's College, Cambridge, but apparently failed to take his degree. He later became a student of law at Gray's Inn (1546), and there obtained some employment under his father in the Court of Augmentations. When the Court of Augmentation was reconstituted, about 1545, Mildmay was made one of its two surveyors-general. During Edward VI's reign, Mildmay extended his official connection. On 22 February 1546-7 he was knighted, and on 14 September prepared, along with three others, an inventory of the late King's wardrobe. Sixteen days later he was appointed a Commissioner to report upon the Crown revenues. In 1548 he acted on commissions for the sale of lands (March) and for the maintenance of such grammar schools as had belonged to the dissolved chantries. After the Duke of Somerset's arrest he was ordered by the Privy Council on 12 November 1549, to examine the royal palace at Westminster, which had been in the Duke's custody, and on 8 March 1550‚Äì1 to take charge of the Duke's property at Syon House. For his services he received many grants of land in Gloucestershire and Berkshire, some of which he exchanged for manors in Oxfordshire and Northamptonshire; other grants of land in Cornwall, Essex and London soon followed. He fixed his country residence at Apethorpe Palace, Northamptonshire, which was granted to him in 1552, and was confirmed to him in 1556. When in London he lived in the parish of St Bartholomew-the-Great., cites: cf. Strype, Grindal, p. 92. Mildmay soon proved himself a skilful financier. In 1550 he was directed, together with the Earl of Warwick and Sir William Herbert, to examine the accounts of the King's mints, and in 1551 superintended the establishment of a new mint at York. In December 1551 he was a Commissioner to inspect the Courts which controlled the Crown lands. *On 2 January 1552 he was commissioned to levy the King's debts; *On 21 November to settle with the Crown accountants the effect of a fall in the value of money; *In December to audit the funds belonging to the king's officers; and *In that and the next year he superintended the receipt by the crown of plate, jewels, bells, and the like surrendered by dissolved monasteries or chantries. Mildmay was elected MP for Lostwithiel in 1545, for Lewes in 1547 and Maldon on 1 March 1553, and then for Peterborough on 5 October 1553. Although he was a convinced Calvinist, Queen Mary's accession did not appreciably depress his fortunes, and before her death he was employed on Government business. On 9 January 1558 he was appointed treasurer of the forces sent to the relief of Calais and was chosen as knight of the shire to represent Northamptonshire in the parliament meeting in January 1557; after this he represented that constituency eight times until his death. Under Queen Elizabeth, with whom he regularly exchanged New-Year's gifts, his influence steadily grew. On her accession he was at once made treasurer of her household, and was appointed a member of a small committee of ways and means to supply the empty exchequer. He was soon employed in preparing a census of the farms of the royal revenues (22 December 1558), in examining Queen Mary's grants of land, in compounding with those who refused knighthood (28 March 1559), in directing the issue of a new coinage (29 October 1560), and in selling crown lands (May 1563). On 21 April 1566 Sir Richard Sackville, the chancellor of the exchequer, died, and Mildmay was appointed as his replacement; he was also made auditor of the Duchy of Lancaster. Occupied in the duties of his offices until his death, he concerned himself little with general politics. As the brother-in-law of Francis Walsingham and the friend of Lord Burghley, he was, however, always heard with attention in the Privy Council, the Star Chamber, and in Parliament. He used what influence he possessed to shield the Puritans from the attacks of the bishops, and often urged the Queen to intervene on behalf of the Protestants in the Low Countries, cites: cf. his discourse in Cott. MS. Calig. C. ix. 49. In his speeches in Parliament he argued that a liberal grant of subsidies placed the government under an obligation to redress grievances, and thus identified himself with the popular party in the commons. In 1572 he helped to prepare evidence against Thomas Howard, 4th Duke of Norfolk, who, nevertheless, after his condemnation gave him some rich jewels. The affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots also occasionally occupied his attention. When she arrived in England in 1567 he strongly advised her detention., cites: cf. his opinion in Burnet's Reformation, pt. ii. bk. iii. No. xii. In October 1577 he and Cecil visited her at Chatsworth, after she had announced that she had important secrets to reveal to Elizabeth. In 1586 he went to Fotheringay Castle and informed her of her forthcoming trial, in which he took part as one of the special commissioners. In March 1587 he urged the condemnation of William Davison in the Star Chamber. Although four times nominated an ambassador to Scotland, in 1565, 1580, 1582, and 1583, he was on each occasion detained at home, but when his name was suggested for the office in 1589, James VI expressed great readiness to receive him. Mildmay's illness, however, brought the suggestion to nothing. The tomb of Sir Walter and Lady Mary Mildmay in St Bartholomew-the-Great Mildmay died at Hackney on 31 May 1589, and is buried beside his wife in the church of St Bartholomew-the-Great in London, where an elaborate monument exists to his memory. The decorations are heraldic, but the Latin epitaph merely records names and dates. The tomb was restored in 1865 by Henry Bingham Mildmay, Esq., cites: Norman Moore, The Church of St. Bartholomew the Great, pp. 41-2 Epitaphs on Mildmay and Sir John Calthrop were licensed by the Stationers' Company on 29 July 1589. They are not known to be extant. Founder of Emmanuel College, Cambridge Arms of Emmanuel College, Cambridge, using one of the lions rampant azure from the Mildmay arms Mildmay displayed his interest in education with much effect. On 23 November 1583 he purchased for ¬£550 the site at Cambridge of the dissolved house of the Dominicans or Black Friars, which was situated in what was then called Preachers Street, but is now known as St Andrew's Street. On 11 January 1583 ‚Äì 1584 he obtained the Queen's licence to set up Emmanuel College there. The architect was Ralph Symons, and in 1588 the new building was opened with a dedication festival, which Mildmay attended. He installed in the college a master, Laurence Chaderton, three fellows, and four scholars; but subsequent benefactions soon increased the fellowships to fourteen and the scholarships to fifty. According to Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court, after the college was opened was addressed by the Queen with the words: \\"Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation\\", to which Mildmay replied: \\"No, madam; far be it from me to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows what will be the fruit thereof\\". His statutes for the government of Emmanuel College are dated 1 October 1585 and are attested by his sons, Anthony and Humphrey, John Hammond, LL.D., William Lewyn, LL.D., Thomas Byng, LL.D., Timothy Bright, M.D., and Edward Downing. Mildmay deprecated perpetual fellowships, and warned the fellows against regarding the college as \\"a perpetual abode\\" -- they were to look forward to spreading outside the knowledge they acquired within its walls., cites: cf. University and College Documents, iii. 483-526; Willis and Clark's Architectural Hist. of Cambridge, ii. 687 sq. Mildmay otherwise showed his interest in education by acting as an original governor of Chelmsford Chantry School, now King Edward VI Grammar School, founded in 1550‚Äì1; by giving an annuity of 52s. to Christ's Hospital (10 April 1556); and by bestowing ¬£20 a year on Christ's College, Cambridge (10 March 1568 ‚Äì 1569), to be expended on a Greek lectureship, six scholarships and a preachership to be filled by a fellow of the college. He also contributed stone for completing the tower of Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge, and he helped to found the free-school at Middleton, Lancashire. There are three portraits of Mildmay at Emmanuel College; one with his wife. A fourth painting was at Moulsham Hall demolished in 1809, near Chelmsford, and a fifth at Knole Park, Sevenoaks. There are also engravings by J. Faber and E. Harding, and an unsigned plate is known. Character and publications Sidney Lee wrote that Mildmay was a man of cultivation and of great piety, with some popular reputation as a believer in second sight. Henry Caesar, dean of Ely, was directed by the Star Chamber to retract a report that he had circulated to the effect that Mildmay had endeavoured to see by conjuration the person of Cardinal Pole after his death. Henry Roberts, in his Fames Trumpet Soundinge, 1589, mentions a book by Mildmay, and describes it as \\"in print now extant\\". It was entitled A Note to know a Good Man. Sir John Harington, in his Orlando Furioso, bk. xxii, p. 175, gives a stanza in Latin with an English translation; the former he says he derived from Mildmay's Latin poems, which are not otherwise known. A \\"memorial\\" by Mildmay, written for his son Anthony in 1570, consisting of sensible moral precepts, was printed from a manuscript at Apethorpe by the Rev. Arundell St John Mildmay in 1893. Many of his official letters and papers are at Hatfield or in the state paper office. Marriage and issue Mildmay married Mary Walsingham (died 16 March 1576), a daughter of William Walsingham by his wife Joyce Denny, a daughter of Edmund Denny, a Baron of the Exchequer, and a sister of Sir Francis Walsingham. By his wife he had issue including: *Sir Anthony Mildmay (d.1617), of Apethorpe, eldest son and heir, an ambassador to France, who married Grace Sharington by whom he had one daughter Mary Mildmay. *Humphrey Mildmay of Danbury Place, Essex, father of Sir Henry Mildmay; *Winifred Mildmay, wife of Sir William Fitzwilliam of Gains Park, Essex; *Martha Mildmay, wife of Sir William Brouncker; *Christiana Mildmay, wife successively of Charles Barrett of Aveley in Essex, and Sir John Leveson of Kent, Knight.

The term may be applied to the budget of a government, private company, or individual. Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, as discussed below.  Controversy  Government deficit spending is a central point of controversy in economics, with prominent economists holding differing views.In \\"Britain‚Äôs Deficit\\", February 16, 2010, Paul Krugman cites two opposing groups of economists, one arguing that Britain should cut its deficit immediately, the other arguing that the deficit provides useful or necessary fiscal stimulus. The mainstream economics position is that deficit spending is desirable and necessary as part of countercyclical fiscal policy, but that there should not be a structural deficit (i.e., permanent deficit): The government should run deficits during recessions to compensate for the shortfall in aggregate demand, but should run surpluses in boom times so that there is no net deficit over an economic cycle (i.e., only run cyclical deficits and not structural deficits). This is derived from Keynesian economics, and gained acceptance during the period between the Great Depression in the 1930s and post-WWII in the 1950s. This position is attacked from both sides: Advocates of federal-level fiscal conservatism argue that deficit spending is always bad policy, while some post-Keynesian economists‚Äîparticularly neo-chartalists or proponents of Modern Monetary Theory‚Äîargue that deficit spending is necessary for the issuance of new money, and not only for fiscal stimulus. According to most economists, during recessions, the government can stimulate the economy by intentionally running a deficit. The deficit spending requested by John Maynard Keynes for overcoming crises is the monetary side of his economy theory. As investment equates to real saving, money assets that build up are equivalent to debt capacity. Therefore, the excess saving of money in time of crisis should correspond to increased levels of borrowing, as this generally doesn't happen - the result is intensification of the crisis, as revenues from which money could be saved decline while a higher level of debt is needed to compensate for the collapsing revenues. The state's deficit enables a correspondent buildup of money assets for the private sector and prevents the breakdown of the economy, preventing private money savings to be run down by private debt. The monetary mechanism describing how revenue surpluses enforce corresponding expense surpluses, and how these in turn lead to economic breakdown was explained by Wolfgang St√ºtzel much later by the means of his Balances Mechanics. William Vickrey, awarded the 1996 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, commented: = Fiscal conservatism = Advocates of fiscal conservatism reject Keynesianism by arguing that government should always run a balanced budget (and a surplus to pay down any outstanding debt), and that deficit spending is always bad policy. Fiscal conservatism has academic support, predominantly associated with the neoclassical-inclined Chicago school of economics, and has significant political and institutional support, with all of the United States except Vermont having a balanced budget amendment to their state constitution, and the Stability and Growth Pact of the European Monetary Union punishing government deficits of 3% of GDP or greater. Proponents of fiscal conservatism date back to Adam Smith, founder of modern economics. Fiscal conservatism was the dominant position until the Great Depression, associated with the gold standard and expressed in the now outdated Treasury View that government fiscal policy is ineffective. The usual argument against deficit spending, dating to Adam Smith, is that households should not run deficits‚Äîone should have money before one spends it, from prudence‚Äîand that what is correct for a household is correct for a nation and its government. A similar argument is that deficit spending today will require increased taxation in the future, thus burdening future generations. (See generational accounting for discussion.) Others argue that because debt is both owed by and owed to private individuals, there is no net debt burden of government debt, just wealth transfer (redistribution) from those who owe debt (government, backed by tax payers) to those who hold debt (holders of government bonds). A related line of argument, associated with the Austrian school of economics, is that government deficits are inflationary. Anything other than mild or moderate inflation is generally accepted in economics to be a bad thing. In practice this is argued to be because governments pay off debts by printing money, increasing the money supply and creating inflation, and is taken further by some as an argument against fiat money and in favor of hard money, especially the gold standard.James Rickards, Currency Wars = Post-Keynesian economics = Some Post-Keynesian economists argue that deficit spending is necessary, either to create the money supply (Chartalism) or to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment. Chartalists argue that deficit spending is logically necessary because, in their view, fiat money is created by deficit spending: fiat money cannot be collected in taxes before it is issued and spent; the amount of fiat money in circulation is exactly the government debt‚Äîmoney spent but not collected in taxes. In a quip, \\"fiat money governments are 'spend and tax', not 'tax and spend'\\"‚Äîdeficit spending comes first. Chartalists argue that nations are fundamentally different from households. Governments in a fiat money system which only have debt in their own currency can issue other liabilities, their fiat money, to pay off their interest bearing bond debt. They cannot go bankrupt involuntarily because this fiat money is what is used in their economy to settle debts, while household liabilities are not so used. This view is summarized as: Continuing in this vein, Chartalists argue that a structural deficit is necessary for monetary expansion in an expanding economy: if the economy grows, the money supply should as well, which should be accomplished by government deficit spending. Private sector savings are equal to government sector deficits, to the penny. In the absence of sufficient deficit spending, money supply can increase by increasing financial leverage in the economy‚Äîthe amount of bank money grows, while the base money supply remains unchanged or grows at a slower rate, and thus the ratio (leverage = credit/base) increases‚Äîwhich can lead to a credit bubble and a financial crisis. Chartalism is a small minority view in economics; while it has had advocates over the years, and influenced Keynes, who specifically credited it,See references at Chartalism for the influence on Keynes. A notable proponent was Ukrainian-American economist Abba P. Lerner, who founded the school of Neo-Chartalism, and advocated deficit spending in his theory of functional finance. A contemporary center of Neo-Chartalism is the Kansas City School of economics. Chartalists, like other Keynesians, accept the paradox of thrift, which argues that identifying behavior of individual households and the nation as a whole commits the fallacy of composition; while the paradox of thrift (and thus deficit spending for fiscal stimulus) is widely accepted in economics, the Chartalist form is not. An alternative argument for the necessity of deficits was given by U.S. economist William Vickrey, who argued that deficits were necessary to satisfy demand for savings in excess of what can be satisfied by private investment. Government deficits When the outlay of a government (i.e., the total of its purchases of goods and services, transfers in grants to individuals and corporations, and its net interest payments) exceeds its tax revenues, the government budget is said to be in deficit; government spending in excess of tax receipts is known as deficit spending. Governments usually issue bonds to match their deficits. They can be bought by its Central Bank through open market operations. Otherwise the debt issuance can increase the level of (i) public debt, (ii) private sector net worth, (iii) debt service (interest payments), and (iv) interest rates. (See Crowding out below.) Deficit spending may, however, be consistent with public debt remaining stable as a proportion of GDP, depending on the level of GDP growth. The opposite of a budget deficit is a budget surplus; in this case, tax revenues exceed government purchases and transfer payments. For the public sector to be in deficit implies that the private sector (domestic and foreign) is in surplus. An increase in public indebtedness must necessarily therefore correspond to an equal decrease in private sector net indebtedness. In other words, deficit spending permits the private sector to accumulate net worth. On average, through the economic cycle, most governments have tended to run budget deficits, as can be seen from the large debt balances accumulated by governments across the world. =Keynesian effect= Following John Maynard Keynes, many economists recommend deficit spending to moderate or end a recession, especially a severe one. When the economy has high unemployment, an increase in government purchases creates a market for business output, creating income and encouraging increases in consumer spending, which creates further increases in the demand for business output. (This is the multiplier effect.) This raises the real gross domestic product (GDP) and the employment of labour, and if all else is constant, lowers the unemployment rate. (The connection between demand for GDP and unemployment is called Okun's law.) The increased size of the market, due to government deficits, can further stimulate the economy by raising business profitability and spurring optimism, which encourages private fixed investment in factories, machines, and the like to rise. This accelerator effect stimulates demand further and encourages rising employment. Similarly, running a government surplus or reducing its deficit reduces consumer and business spending and raises unemployment. This can lower the inflation rate. Any use of the government deficit to steer the macro-economy is called fiscal policy. A deficit does not simply stimulate demand. If private investment is stimulated, that increases the ability of the economy to supply output in the long run. Also, if the government's deficit is spent on such things as infrastructure, basic research, public health, and education, that can also increase potential output in the long run. Finally, the high demand that a government deficit provides may actually allow greater growth of potential supply, following Verdoorn's law. Deficit spending may create inflation, or encourage existing inflation to persist. For example, in the United States Vietnam-war era deficits encouraged inflation. This is especially true at low unemployment rates. But government deficits are not the only cause of inflation: It can arise due to such supply-side shocks as the oil crises of the 1970s and inflation left over from the past (e.g., inflationary expectations and the price/wage spiral). If equilibrium is located on the classical range of the supply graph, an increase in government spending will lead to inflation without affecting unemployment. There must also be enough money circulating in the system to allow inflation to persist, so that inflation depends on monetary policy. =Loanable funds= Many economists believe government deficits influence the economy through the loanable funds market, whose existence Chartalists and other Post-Keynesians dispute. Government borrowing in this market increases the demand for loanable funds and thus (ignoring other changes) pushes up interest rates. Rising interest rates can crowd out, or discourage, fixed private investment spending, canceling out some or even all of the demand stimulus arising from the deficit‚Äîand perhaps hurting long-term supply-side growth. Increased deficits also raise the amount of total income received, which raises the amount of saving done by individuals and corporations and thus the supply of loanable funds, lowering interest rates. Thus, crowding out is a problem only when the economy is already close to full employment (say, at about 4% unemployment) and the scope for increasing income and saving is blocked by resource constraints (potential output). Despite a government debt that exceeded GDP in 1945, the U.S. saw the long prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s. The growth of the supply side, it seems, was not hurt by the large deficits and debts. A government deficit increases government debt. In many countries the government borrows by selling bonds rather than borrowing from banks. The most important burden of this debt is the interest that must be paid to bond- holders, which restricts a government's ability to raise its outlays or cut taxes to attain other goals. =Crowding out= Usually when economists use the term \\"crowding out\\" they are referring to the government spending using up financial and other resources that would otherwise be used by private enterprise. However, some commentators use \\"crowding out\\" to refer to government providing a service or good that would otherwise be a business opportunity for private industry. =Unintentional deficits= National government deficits may be intentional, a result of policy decisions, or unintentional. When an economy goes into a recession, deficits usually rise in the more affluent countries. Revenue from progressive taxes based on economic activity (income, expenditure, or transactions) falls. Other sources of tax revenue such as wealth taxes, notably property taxes, are not subject to recessions, though they are subject to asset price bubbles. Transfer payments due to increased unemployment and reduced household income rise. =Automatic vs. active deficit policies= Most economists favor the use of automatic stabilization over active or discretionary use of deficits to fight mild recessions (or surpluses to combat inflation). Active policy-making takes too long for politicians to institute and too long to affect the economy. Often, the medicine ends up affecting the economy only after its disease has been cured, leaving the economy with side-effects such as inflation. For example, President John F. Kennedy proposed tax cuts in response to the high unemployment of 1960, but these were instituted only in 1964 and impacted the economy only in 1965 or 1966 and the increased debt encouraged inflation, reinforcing the effect of Vietnam war deficit spending. Structural and cyclical deficit Structural (blue) and cyclical (green) components are summed to give the headline deficit/surplus (red) for a hypothetical economy Structural and cyclical deficits are two components of deficit spending. These terms are especially applied to public sector spending which contributes to the budget balance of the overall economy of a country. The total budget deficit, or headline deficit, is equal to the sum of the structural deficit and the cyclical deficit (or surplus/es). =Cyclical deficit= A cyclical (temporary) deficit is a deficit that is related to the business or economic cycle. The business cycle is the period of time it takes for an economy to move from expansion to contraction, until it begins to expand again. This cycle can last anywhere from several months to many years, and does not follow a predictable pattern. The cyclical deficit is the deficit experienced at the low point of this cycle when there are lower levels of business activity and higher levels of unemployment. This leads to lower government revenues from taxation and higher government expenditure on things like social security, which may cause the economy to go into deficit. While the cyclical component is affected by government decisions, it is mainly influenced by national and international economic conditions which can be significantly beyond government control. =Structural deficit= A structural (permanent) deficit differs from a cyclical deficit in that it exists regardless of the point in the business cycle due to an underlying imbalance in government revenues and expenditures. Thus, even at the high point of the business cycle when revenues are high the country's economy may still be in deficit. The structural component of the budget is used by some economists as an indication of a government's financial management, as it indicates the underlying balance between long-term government revenues and expenditure, while removing factors that are mainly attributable to the business cycle. Other economists see the structural deficit as simply a reflection of the implied discretionary fiscal stance of the government, that is, a structural deficit would be an expansionary fiscal stance that promotes at least nominal economic growth. Where deficits are being funded by borrowing, a structural deficit is seen by some economists as an issue for a government as even at the high points of the business cycle the government may need to continue to borrow and thus continue to accumulate debt. According to them, this would lead to continued \\"deterioration\\" of the debt-to-GDP ratio, a basic measure of the health of an economy and an indication of the country's ability to pay off its debts. Other economists believe that provided the debt is issued in the country's own currency, and provided that currency 'floats' freely against other currencies, and provided the overall level of the deficit is not so large as to cause excessive inflation, then structural deficits are harmless. Those economists who believe that structural deficits need to be reduced argue that structural deficit issues can only be addressed by explicit and direct government policies, primarily involving reducing government spending or increasing taxation. An alternative in countries which have fiat money is to address high levels of debt and a poor debt-to-GDP ratio by monetising the debt, essentially creating more money to be used to pay off the debt. Monetising the debt can lead to high levels of inflation, but with proper fiscal control this can be minimised or even avoided. Both it and the final option of defaulting on the debt are thought to be poor results for investors. There having been recent incidents involving quantitative easing in the UK, the U.S. and the Eurozone following the 2008 global financial crisis. These are the first instances of either since the dropping of the gold standard. Structural deficits may be planned, or may be unintentional due to poor economic management or a fundamental lack of economic capacity in a country. In a planned structural deficit, the government may commit to spending money on the future of the country in order to improve the productive potential of the economy, for example investing in infrastructure, education, or transport, with the intention that this investment will yield long-term economic gains. If these investments work out as planned the structural deficit will be dealt with over the long-term due to the returns on investment. However, if expenditures continue to exceed revenues, the structural deficit will worsen. A government may also knowingly plan the budget to be in deficit in order to sustain the country's standard of living and continue its obligations to the citizens, although this would generally be an indication of poor economic management. Ongoing planned structural deficits may eventually lead to a crisis of confidence in investors regarding the country's ability to pay the debt, as seen in the financial crises in a number of European countries since the late-2000s, especially the Greek and Spanish financial crises. =Structural and cyclical surplus= Structural and cyclical surpluses are the opposite of the deficits described above. With a cyclical surplus, at the high point of the business cycle government revenue will be expected to be higher and government expenditure lower, meaning revenue exceeds expenditure and the government experiences a surplus. Likewise, a structural surplus is when the government budget is fundamentally operating at a surplus regardless of its point in the business cycle. =Interplay of structural and cyclical components= The overall government budget balance is determined by the sum of the cyclical deficit or surplus and the structural deficit or surplus (refer to chart). Therefore, for example, a cyclical surplus could mask an underlying structural deficit, as the overall budget may appear to be in surplus if the cyclical surplus is greater than the structural deficit. In this case, as economic conditions deteriorated and the budget went into cyclical deficit, the structural and cyclical deficits would then compound leading to higher deficits and more dire economic conditions. An example of this occurred in Australia during the later years of the Howard Government. From 2009 Treasury attempted to separate cyclical and structural components of the budget balance, and first started publishing estimates of the structural component. Treasury showed that despite a run of large and often unexpected headline surpluses, the Australian economy was in fact in structural deficit from at least 2006‚Äì07, and was deteriorating as far back as 2002‚Äì03. At this time they determined that despite a headline surplus of A$17.2 billion in 2006‚Äì07, there was an underlying structural deficit of around $3 billion, or 0.3% of GDP. This structural deficit was caused by a mining boom leading to extremely high revenues and large surpluses for several consecutive years, which the Howard Government then used to fuel spending and tax cuts, rather than saving or investing them to cover future cyclical downturns. With the Global Financial Crisis unexpectedly starting in 2007, revenues quickly and significantly declined and the underlying structural deficit was exposed and exacerbated, which then had to be dealt with by later governments. By 2008‚Äì09 when the budget had a headline deficit of $32 billion, the structural deficit was out to around $50 billion. In 2013 it was estimated the structural deficit remained at about $40 billion, or 2.5% of GDP. =Criticism= Economist Chris Dillow has questioned the distinction between cyclical and structural deficits, and this has received support from other leading economists. He contends that there are too many variables involved to allow a clear distinction to be made, especially when dealing with current circumstances rather than retrospectively, and suggests that the concept of structural deficits may be used more for political purposes than analytical purposes. The piece largely centred on the UK Labour government 1997-2010 of which Chris Dillow was a strong supporter and criticism that they ran a large structural deficit. Economic representatives of that government acknowledge that, unbeknownst to them at the time, they were running a structural deficit. Economist, Professor Bill Mitchell has also questioned the misuse of the term 'structural deficit', particularly in the Australian context. Martin Wolf, in his book \\"The Shifts and the Shocks\\",The Shifts and the Shocks: What We‚Äôve Learned‚Äîand Have Still to Learn‚Äîfrom the Financial Crisis, p.76-77, Penguin Press 2014, argues that nobody knows what the 'structural' or cyclically adjusted balance is and that it is least knowable precisely when such knowledge is most essential, namely, when the economy is experiencing a boom. He provides two examples of widely divergent IMF estimates of the average structural fiscal balance of Ireland and Spain, for the period 2000‚Äì2007. The estimates were made in 2008 and in 2012 and Wolf stresses that they were post- fact estimates and not predictions. Specifically, in 2008, the IMF declared that Ireland had run an average structural surplus of 1.3% of GDP, per year, between 2000 and 2007, and Spain an average structural surplus of 0.5% of GDP, per year, over the same period. Then, four years later, the IMF decided that, for this same 8-year period, Ireland's annual average structural balance was four percentage points worse than it had thought in April 2008, estimating that Ireland had been running an average structural fiscal deficit of 2.7% of GDP. For Spain, the 2012 IMF estimate differed by 1.7 percentage points, estimating this time that Spain had been running and average structural fiscal deficit of 1.2% of GDP, in the years 2000‚Äì7.

He was a pioneer in fighter aviation and is often mistakenly credited with the first aerial victory using a synchronized gun, which was actually performed on 15 July 1915 by German ace Kurt Wintgens. He was the first aviator to win the Pour le M√©rite (colloquially known as the \\"Blue Max\\" in his honor), and was awarded it at the same time as Oswald Boelcke. His name has become attached to a common flying tactic, the Immelmann turn, and remains a byword in aviation. He is credited with 15 aerial victories. Early life Max Immelmann was born on 21 September 1890, in Dresden, to an industrialist father who died when Max was young. In 1905, he was enrolled in the Dresden Cadet School. He joined the Eisenbahnregiment (Railway Regiment) Nr. 2 in 1911 as an Ensign,Franks et al 1993, pp. 134-135. in pursuit of a commission. He left the army in March 1912 to study mechanical engineering in Dresden. He returned to service on the outbreak of war, as a reserve officer candidate. He was assigned to Eisenbahnregiment Nr. 1, but soon transferred to aviation.van Wyngarden 2006, p. 13.  Wartime career  Immelmann's first Eindecker, E.13/15 When World War I started, Immelmann was called to active service, transferred to Die Fliegertruppe (later known as the Luftstreitkr√§fte) and was sent for pilot training at Johannisthal Air Field in November 1914. He was initially stationed in northern France. Immelmann served as a pilot with Feldflieger Abteilung (Field Flier Detachment) 10 from February to April 1915, and then in FFA 62 by early May 1915. On several occasions he engaged in combat while flying the L.V.G. two-seaters with which his units were equipped, but never with any success.Shores, 1983, p. 10. On 3 June 1915, he was shot down by a French pilot, but managed to land safely behind German lines. Immelmann was decorated with the Iron Cross, Second Class, for preserving his aircraft. Silver beaker given to Immelmann, Bundeswehr Military History Museum Two very early examples of the Fokker Eindecker fighters were delivered to the unit, one Fokker M.5K/MG production prototype numbered E.3/15 for Oswald Boelcke's use, with Immelmann later in July receiving E.13/15 as a production Fokker E.I for his own use before the end of July. It was with the E.13/15 aircraft, armed with the synchronized MG 08 machine gun, that he gained his first confirmed air victory of the war on 1 August 1915, a fortnight after Leutnant Kurt Wintgens obtained the very first confirmed German aerial victory on 15 July 1915 with his own Fokker M.5K/MG production prototype E.5/15 Eindecker,VanWyngarden, pg.12 one of five built, following two unconfirmed ones on 1 and 4 July, all before Immelmann:Shores, 1983, p. 10. Lieutenant William Reid fought back valiantly, flying with his left hand and firing a pistol with his right. Nonetheless, the 450 bullets fired at him took their effect; Reid suffered four wounds in his left arm, and his airplane's engine quit, causing a crash landing. The unarmed Immelmann landed nearby, and approached Reid; they shook hands and Immelmann said to the British pilot \\"You are my prisoner\\" and pulled Reid out of the wreckage and rendered first aid.van Wyngarden 2006, pp. 14‚Äì15. Immelmann became one of the first German fighter pilots, quickly building an impressive score of air victories. During September, three more victories followed, and then in October he became solely responsible for the air defense of the city of Lille. Immelmann became known as The Eagle of Lille (Der Adler von Lille).Shores, 1983, p. 10. Immelmann flirted with the position of Germany's leading ace, trading that spot off with Oswald Boelcke, another pioneer ace. Having come second to Boelcke for his sixth victory, he was second to be awarded the Royal House Order of Hohenzollern for this feat. On 15 December, Immelmann shot down his seventh British plane and moved into an unchallenged lead in the competition to be Germany's leading ace.van Wyngarden 2006, pp. 28‚Äì29. Immelmann was the first pilot to be awarded the Pour le M√©rite, Germany's highest military honour, receiving it on the day of his eighth win,van Wyngarden 2006, p. 30. 12 January 1916.

Immelmann would chase him in the ace race for the next four months, drawing even on 13 March at 11 each, losing the lead on the 19th, regaining it on Easter Sunday (23 April) 14 to 13, losing it again forever on 1 May.van Wyngarden 2006, p. 37. It was about this time, on 25 April, that Immelmann received a salutary lesson in the improvement of British aircraft. As the German ace described his attack on two Airco DH.2s, \\"The two worked splendidly together ... and put 11 shots into my machine. The petrol tank, the struts on the fuselage, the undercarriage and the propeller were hit ... It was not a nice business.\\"van Wyngarden 2006, p. 51.Guttman 1983, p. 32. On 31 May, Immelmann, Max von Mulzer, and another German pilot attacked a formation of seven British aircraft. Immelmann was flying a two-gun Fokker E.IV, and when he opened fire, the synchronizing gear malfunctioned. A stream of bullets cut off the tip of a propeller blade. The thrashing of the unbalanced air screw nearly shook the aircraft's Oberursel engine loose from its mounts before he could cut the ignition and glide to a dead-stick landing.van Wyngarden 2006, p. 56. Death Tomb - Max Immelmann - Dresden Tolkewitz \\"Der Adler von Lille\\" - Tomb Immelmann - Dresden - In the late afternoon of 18 June 1916, Immelmann led a flight of four Fokker E.III Eindeckers in search of a flight of eight F.E.2b fighter/reconnaissance aircraft of 25 Squadron Royal Flying Corps over Sallaumines in northern France. The British flight had just crossed the lines near Arras, with the intent of photographing the German infantry and artillery positions within the area, when Immelmann's flight intercepted them. After a long-running fight, scattering the participants over an area of some 30 square miles, Immelmann brought down one of the enemy aircraft, wounding both the pilot and observer. This was his 16th victory claim, though it was to go unconfirmed. At 21:45 that same evening, Immelmann in Fokker E.III, serial 246/16 encountered No. 25 Squadron again, this time near the village of Lens. Immediately, he got off a burst which hit RFC Lt. J.R.B. Savage, pilot of F.E.2b pusher serial 4909, mortally wounding him. This was his 17th victory claim, though Max Mulzer was later credited with the victory. The crew of the second aircraft he closed on was piloted by Second Lieutenant G.R. McCubbin with Corporal J. H. Waller as gunner/observer, and was credited by the British with shooting Immelmann down. On the German side, many had seen Immelmann as invincible and could not conceive the notion that he had fallen to enemy fire. Meanwhile, British authorities awarded McCubbin the Distinguished Service Order and the Distinguished Service Medal and sergeant's stripes for Waller.Guttman 1983, pp. 27‚Äì29. The German Air Service at the time claimed the loss was due to (friendly) anti-aircraft fire.\\"Max Immelmann.\\" acepilots.com. Retrieved: 10 October 2010. Others, including Immelmann's brother, believed his aircraft's gun synchronisation (designed to enable his machine gun to fire between the whirling propeller blades without damaging them) had malfunctioned with catastrophic results.Guttman 1983, p. 28. This is not unreasonable, as early versions of such gears frequently malfunctioned in this way. Indeed, this had already happened to Immelmann twice before, while testing two- and three- machine gun installations, although on each occasion, he had been able to land safely. McCubbin, in a 1935 interview, claimed that immediately after Immelmann shot down McCubbin's squadron mate, the German ace began an Immelmann turn, McCubbin and Waller swooped down from a greater altitude and opened fire, and the pioneer German ace fell out of the sky. Waller also pointed out later that the British bullets could have hit Immelmann's propeller.Guttman 1983, pp. 28‚Äì29. Damage to the propeller resulting in the loss of one blade could have been the primary cause of the structural failure evident in accounts of the crash of his aircraft. The resultant vibration of an engine at full throttle spinning half a propeller could have shaken the fragile craft to pieces. At 2,000 meters, the tail was seen to break away from the rest of Immelmann's Fokker, the wings detached or folded,\\"Immelmann's Death..\\" The Argus (Melbourne, Victoria: 1848‚Äì1956), 5 July 1916, p. 9 via National Library of Australia.

His body was recovered by the German 6 Armee from the twisted wreckage, lying smashed and lifeless over what was left of the surprisingly intact Oberursel engine (sometimes cited as under it), but was only identified because he had his initials embroidered on his handkerchief.\\"Max Immelmann.\\" theaerodrome.com. Retrieved: 10 October 2010. Immelmann was given a state funeral and buried in his home of Dresden. His body was later exhumed, however, and cremated in the Dresden-Tolkewitz Crematorium. Immelmann, along with Max Ritter von Mulzer, scored all of his victories flying only different types of Eindeckers, becoming one of the most successful pilots in the type.

Immelmann, along with Oswald Boelcke and other pilots, was one of the main exponents of the Fokker Eindecker, resulting in the Fokker Scourge which inflicted heavy losses upon British and French aircrews during 1915. Initially, Immelmann shared the same E.3/15 machine with Oswald Boelcke, but late in the summer of 1915 would receive his own machine, bearing the IdFlieg serial number E.13/15 on its fuselage. Both the E.3/15 machine earlier shared with Boelcke, and his own E.13/15 aircraft, both used to secure Immelmann's first five victories between them each had a seven-cylinder 80 horsepower Oberursel U.0 rotary engine for their power. According to Immelmann, the later E.13/15 aircraft was retired and shipped off to Berlin for display at the Zeughaus Museum, in March 1916.,Immelmann 2009, p. 163, letter to his mother dated 16 March 1916. but was wrecked in the first bombing raids of the Royal Air Force in 1940, during World War II. The Immelmann turn This refers to two quite different aerobatic maneuvers. The first of these is the one now known as an \\"Immelmann\\" (also frequently spelled \\"Immelman\\", in literature and media). # A half loop followed by a half roll on top, used to rapidly reverse the direction of flight. This maneuver may not have been practical in the primitive, underpowered fighters of 1915‚Äì1916, and its connection with the German fighter ace is doubtful.Wheeler 1965, pp. 27-35. # During World War I, an \\"Immelmann turn\\" was actually a sharp rudder turn off a vertical zoom climb (almost to a full stall) or modified chandelle followed by a steep dive. Immelmann may very well have originated this maneuver, or at least used it in combat, although this cannot be authenticated.

After the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a new series of death penalty statutes in the 1976 decision Gregg v. Georgia, he became the first person in almost ten years to be executed in the United States. These new statutes avoided the problems under the 1972 decision in Furman v. Georgia, which had resulted in earlier death penalty statutes being deemed as \\"cruel and unusual\\" punishment, and therefore unconstitutional. (The Supreme Court had previously ordered all states to commute death sentences to life imprisonment after Furman v. Georgia.) Gilmore was executed by a firing squad in 1977. His life and execution were the subject of the 1979 nonfiction novel The Executioner's Song by Norman Mailer, and 1982 TV film of the novel starring Tommy Lee Jones as Gilmore. Early life Gary Mark Gilmore was born in McCamey, Texas, on December 4, 1940, the second of four sons, to Frank and Bessie Gilmore. The other sons were Frank, Jr., Gaylen, and the writer and music journalist Mikal Gilmore. Frank Harry Gilmore, Sr. (c. November 23, 1890, Lincoln, Nebraska - July 31, 1962, Seattle, Washington), an alcoholic con man, had other wives and families, none of whom he supported. On a whim, he married Bessie (n√©e Brown) (August 19, 1913, Provo, Utah - June 29, 1981, Portland, Oregon), a Mormon outcast from Provo, Utah, in Sacramento, California. Gary was born while they were living in Texas under the pseudonym of Coffman to avoid the law. Frank christened his son Faye Robert Coffman, but once they left Texas, Bessie changed it to Gary Mark. This name change proved to be a sore point years later. Frank's mother, Fay, kept the original \\"Faye Coffman\\" birth certificate, and when Gary found it two decades later, he assumed he must be either illegitimate or someone else's son. He seized on this as the reason that he and his father never got along; he became very upset and walked out on his mother when she tried to explain the name change to him.Gilmore, Mikal; pp. 84‚Äì85. The theme of illegitimacy, real or imagined, was common in the Gilmore family. Frank Sr.'s mother, Fay Gilmore, once told Bessie that Frank Sr.'s father was a famous magician who had passed through Sacramento, where she was living. Bessie researched this at the library and concluded that Frank was the illegitimate son of Harry Houdini. In fact, Houdini was only sixteen years old in 1890, the year of Frank Gilmore's birth, and did not begin his career as a magician until the following year. As such, whether Fay meant that Frank Sr.'s father was someone who would later become known as a famous magician may never be known. Mikal Gilmore, Gary's youngest brother, believes the story to be false, but has stated that both his father and mother believed it. During Gary's childhood, the family frequently relocated throughout the Western United States, with Frank supporting them by selling fake magazine subscriptions. Gary had a troubled relationship with his father, whom his youngest brother Mikal described as a \\"cruel and unreasonable man.\\" Frank Gilmore Sr. was strict and quick to anger, and would often whip his sons, Frank Jr., Gary, and Gaylen, with a razor strop, whip, or a belt for little or no reason. Less often, he would beat his wife. He mellowed somewhat with age: Mikal reported that Frank whipped him only once, and never did it again after Mikal told him, \\"I hate you.\\" In addition, Frank and Bessie would argue loudly and verbally abuse each other. Frank would anger Bessie by calling her crazy, and defame Brigham Young, the second president and prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, as \\"Bring 'em Young\\". Bessie would retaliate by calling him a \\"Cat-licker\\" [Catholic] and threatening to kill him some night. This abuse continued for years and caused considerable turmoil within the Gilmore family.Gilmore, Mikal; pp. 123‚Äì127, 174‚Äì175. In 1952, the Gilmore family settled in Portland, Oregon. As an adolescent, Gary began engaging in petty crime. Although Gilmore had an IQ test score of 133, gained high scores on both aptitude and achievement tests, and showed artistic talent, he dropped out of high school in the ninth grade. He ran away from home with a friend to Texas, returning to Portland after several months. Criminal career At the age of 14, Gary started a small car theft ring with friends, which resulted in his first arrest. He was released to his father with a warning. Two weeks later, he was back in court on another car theft charge. The court remanded him to the MacLaren Reform School for Boys in Woodburn, Oregon, from which he was released the following year. He was sent to Oregon State Correctional Institution on another car theft charge in 1960 and was released later that year. In 1961, Frank, Sr., Gary's father, was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer; he died at the end of July 1962, while Gary was in Rocky Butte Jail in Portland, facing charges of driving without a license. A jail guard told Gary when his father died. Despite his dysfunctional relationship with his father, Gary was devastated and tried to kill himself by slitting his wrists. After his father died, Gilmore got into more and more trouble, as the wilder side of him came out, and he was frequently drunk. He faced assault and armed robbery charges again in 1964 and was given a 15-year prison sentence as a habitual offender and sent to the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem, Oregon. A prison psychiatrist diagnosed him with antisocial personality disorder with intermittent psychotic decompensation. He was granted conditional release in 1972 to live weekdays in a halfway house in Eugene, Oregon, and study art at a community college. Gilmore never registered and, within a month, he was arrested and convicted of armed robbery. Due to his violent behavior in prison, Gilmore was transferred in 1975 from Oregon to the federal prison in Marion, Illinois, at the time a maximum security facility. Gilmore was conditionally paroled in April 1976 and went to Provo, Utah, to live with a distant cousin, Brenda Nicol, who tried to help him find work. Gilmore worked briefly at his uncle Vern Damico's shoe repair shop and then for an insulation company owned by Spencer McGrath, but he soon returned to his previous lifestyle of stealing, drinking, and fighting. Gilmore, then 35, had a relationship with Nicole Barrett Baker (later Nicole Barrett Henry), a 19-year-old who'd been married twice before and had two young children. The relationship was at first casual, but soon became intense and strained due to Gilmore's aggressive behavior and to pressure from Baker's family to prevent her from seeing him. =Murders= On the evening of July 19, 1976, Gilmore robbed and murdered Max Jensen, a gas station employee in Orem, Utah. The next evening, he robbed and murdered Bennie Bushnell, a motel manager in Provo. Although both men had complied with his demands, he murdered them. The young men were each ordered to lie down and then were shot in the head. Both were students at Brigham Young University; both left widows with infants.L While disposing of the .22 caliber pistol used in both killings, Gilmore accidentally shot himself in his right hand, leaving a trail of blood to the service garage where he had left his truck to be repaired prior to murdering Bushnell. Garage mechanic Michael Simpson witnessed Gilmore hiding the gun in the bushes. Seeing the blood on Gilmore's crudely bandaged right hand when he approached to pay for the repairs to his truck, and hearing on a police scanner of the shooting at the nearby motel, Simpson wrote down Gilmore's registration plate number and called the police. Gilmore's cousin Brenda turned him in to police shortly after he phoned her asking for bandages and painkillers for the injury to his hand. The Utah State Police apprehended Gilmore as he tried to drive out of Provo, and he gave up without attempting to flee. Although he was charged with the murders of Jensen and Bushnell, the Jensen case was never brought to trial, apparently because there were no eyewitnesses. Trial Gilmore's murder trial began at the Provo courthouse on October 5, 1976, and lasted two days. Peter Arroyo, a motel guest, testified that he saw Gilmore in the motel registration office that night. After taking the money, Gilmore ordered Bushnell to lie down on the floor and then shot him. Gerald F. Wilkes, an FBI ballistics expert, matched the two shell casings and the bullet that killed Bushnell to the gun hidden in the bush, and a patrolman testified that he had traced Gilmore's trail of blood to that same bush. Gilmore's two court-appointed lawyers, Michael Esplin and Craig Snyder, made no attempt to cross-examine the majority of the state's witnesses, and rested without calling any witnesses for the defense. Gilmore protested, and the following day asked the judge if he could take the stand in his own defense, perhaps arguing that due to the dissociation and lack of control he felt at the time, he had a good case for insanity. His attorneys presented the findings of four separate psychiatrists, all of whom had said that Gilmore was aware of what he was doing and that he knew it was wrong at the time. While he did have an antisocial personality disorder, which may have been aggravated by drinking and drugs, he did not meet the legal criteria for insanity. Gilmore withdrew his request. On October 7, the jury retired to deliberate and by mid-day, they had returned with a guilty verdict. Later that day, the jury unanimously recommended the death penalty due to the special circumstances of the crime. Gary chose to not pursue habeas corpus relief in federal court. His mother, Bessie, sued for a stay of execution on his behalf. In a five-to-four decision, the US Supreme Court refused to hear his mother's claim. The Court's per curiam opinion said that the defendant had waived his rights by not pursuing them. At the time, Utah had two methods of execution ‚Äî firing squad or hanging. Believing a hanging could be botched, Gilmore chose the former, declaring, \\"I'd prefer to be shot.\\" The execution was set for November 15 at 8 AM. Against his express wishes, Gilmore received several stays of execution through the efforts of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The last of these occurred just hours before the rescheduled execution date of January 17. That stay was overturned at 7:30 AM, and the execution was allowed to proceed as planned. At a Board of Pardons hearing in November 1976, Gilmore said of the efforts by the ACLU and others to prevent his execution: \\"They always want to get in on the act. I don't think they have ever really done anything effective in their lives. I would like them all ‚Äî including that group of reverends and rabbis from Salt Lake City ‚Äî to butt out. This is my life and this is my death. It's been sanctioned by the courts that I die and I accept that.\\" Andrea D. Lyon: The Death Penalty, What's Keeping It Alive, p. 2 During the time Gilmore was on death row awaiting his execution, he attempted suicide twice; the first time on November 16 after the first stay was issued, and again one month later on December 16. Execution Gilmore was executed by firing squad at Utah State Prison. A reenactment of the execution. Gilmore was executed on January 17, 1977, at 8:07 a.m. by firing squad at Utah State Prison in Draper, Utah. In the morning at the time of execution, Gilmore was transported to an abandoned cannery behind the prison, which served as its death house. He was strapped to a chair, with a wall of sandbags placed behind him to trap the bullets. Five gunmen, local police officers, stood concealed behind a curtain with five small holes, through which they aimed their rifles. When asked for any last words, Gilmore simply replied, \\"Let's do it.\\" The Rev. Thomas Meersman, the Roman Catholic prison chaplain, administered the last rites to Gilmore. After the prison physician cloaked him in a black hood, Gilmore uttered his last words to Meersman: \\"Dominus vobiscum\\" (Latin, translation: \\"The Lord be with you.\\") Meersman replied, \\"Et cum spiritu tuo\\" (\\"And with your spirit.\\") In Utah, firing squads consisted of five volunteer law enforcement officers from the county in which the conviction of the offender took place. The five executioners were equipped with .30-30-caliber rifles and off-the-shelf Winchester 150-grain (9.7 g) SilverTip ammunition. The condemned was restrained and hooded, and the shots were fired at a distance of 20 feet (6 m), aiming at the chest. Prison officials stated that the firing squad comprised four men with live rounds, and one with a blank, so that the shooters could not be certain as to who fired the fatal shots. However, upon inspecting the clothes worn by his brother Gary at his execution, Mikal Gilmore noted five holes in the shirt. According to his memoir Shot in the Heart, \\"the state of Utah, apparently, had taken no chances on the morning that it put my brother to death.\\"Gilmore, Mikal; p. 390. Gilmore had requested that some of his organs be donated for transplant purposes. Within hours of the execution, two people received his corneas. His body was sent for autopsy and was cremated later that day. The following day, his ashes were scattered from an airplane over Spanish Fork, Utah. Representation in the media As Gilmore was the first person in the United States executed since the reinstatement of the death penalty in 1976, his story had immense cultural resonance at the time.‚ÄúPlayboy Interview.‚Äù Interview by Larry Schiller. Playboy (April 1977): 181. Before his execution, the December 11, 1976, episode of NBC's Saturday Night Live (Season 2, Episode 10) featured guest host Candice Bergen and the cast singing a Christmas-themed medley entitled \\"Let's Kill Gary Gilmore for Christmas.\\" Dressed in winter attire and surrounded by fake snow, the performers sang the medley of familiar Christmas carols with altered lyrics. Lyrics set to \\"Winter Wonderland\\" included this line: \\"In the meadow we can build a snowman / One with Gary Gilmore packed inside / We'll ask him, 'Are you dead yet?' He'll say, 'No, man' / But we'll wait out the frostbite till he dies.\\"Saturday Night Live Transcripts ‚Äî Season 2: Episode 10 ‚Äî Candice Bergen / Frank Zappa}Later in the TV season and subsequent to Gilmore's death, NBC re-ran the episode, but the network removed this musical sequence. In its place, NBC inserted a brief, Christmas-oriented film ‚Äî filmed at an airport about people meeting friends and relatives after disembarking from airplanes. For a subsequent broadcast of this episode in 2005, NBC reinserted the original Gilmore sequence. A later episode of Saturday Night Live, on October 20, 1979, featured guest host Eric Idle performing impersonations while strapped to a stretcher, assisted by orderlies. With the stretcher standing on end, Idle covered his eyes with a black blindfold and announced it as an impersonation of Gary Gilmore. In 1977, English punk band The Adverts wrote the song \\"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\\", a reference to the cornea transplantation. The founder of advertising agency Wieden+Kennedy, Dan Wieden credits the inspiration for his \\"Just Do It\\" Nike slogan to Gilmore's last words. Norman Mailer wrote a novel, The Executioner's Song, based on Gilmore's life; it won the Pulitzer Prize. Notable for its portrayal of Gilmore and the anguish surrounding the murders he committed, the book expressed Mailer's thinking about the national debate over the revival of capital punishment. Another writer to blend fact with fiction was Colombian writer Rafael Chaparro Madiedo, who featured Gilmore as one of the main characters of his 1992 novel Opio en las Nubes, which won the National Prize. In 1982, The Executioner's Song was adapted by Mailer for a television movie of the same name starring Tommy Lee Jones as Gilmore, and co-starring Christine Lahti, Eli Wallach, and Rosanna Arquette. Jones won an Emmy Award for his portrayal of Gilmore. Artist Matthew Barney's film Cremaster 2 (1999), featured Gilmore as the main character; it was the second of five films in the series The Cremaster Cycle. Played by an actress, the metamorphosed character corresponding to Gilmore appears in the beginning of Cremaster 3. Mikal Gilmore, an American writer and music journalist and the brother of Gary Gilmore wrote a memoir in 1994 entitled Shot in the Heart, detailing his relationship with Gary and their often troubled family, starting with the original Mormon settlers and continuing through to Gary's execution and its aftermath. Shot in the Heart received positive reviews, including a comment by New York Times critic Michiko Kakutani calling the book \\"Remarkable, astonishing... Shot in the Heart reads like a combination of Brothers Karamazov and a series of Johnny Cash ballads... chilling, heartbreaking, and alarming.\\" In 1994 Shot in the Heart won the Los Angeles Times Book Prize and the National Book Critics Circle Award. In 2001, Shot in the Heart became an HBO film starring Giovanni Ribisi as Mikal, Elias Koteas as Gary, Sam Shepard as the brothers' looming father, and Lee Tergesen as Frank Gilmore, Jr. The 1977 punk rock single \\"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\\" by the band The Adverts was used in the soundtrack of the movie. The song is written from \\"the point of view of a hospital patient who has received the eyes of Gary Gilmore in a transplant.\\" Jack Nicholson's performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice was reportedly inspired in part by Gilmore. Welsh playwright Dic Edwards dramatised Gilmore's life in his 1995 play Utah Blue. Other references Many musicians have explored the Gilmore case. In 1977, The Adverts had a top 20 hit in the UK with the song \\"Gary Gilmore's Eyes\\". The lyrics describe an eye donor recipient realizing his new eyes came from the executed murderer. The song was later covered by German punk rock band Die Toten Hosen and a country version of the song was recorded by Dean Schlabowske. In 1978, Los Angeles punk band The Deadbeats released a song called \\"Let's Shoot Maria\\" which featured the chorus, \\"Gonna finish off what Gary Gilmore started.\\" In 1977, New York City experimental punk band Chain Gang released the song \\"Gary Gilmore and the Island of Dr. Moreau\\" as the B-side to their single \\"Son of Sam\\" about David Berkowitz. The Police's song \\"Bring on the Night\\", from their 1979 album Reggatta de Blanc, speculated on Gary Gilmore's possible feelings on the evening before the execution took place. In 1980, The Judy's released the song \\"How's Gary?\\" on their album Wonderful World of Appliances. The song presumably asks Gary Gilmore's mother what's wrong with him, saying that he never comes out to play anymore. The song also inquires about the holes in his vest and why he is wearing a blindfold. Several playwrights have integrated the Gilmore story into their work in one way or another. The Oakland-based performance artist Monte Cazazza sent out photos of himself in an electric chair on the day of the execution. One of these was mistakenly printed in a Hong Kong newspaper as the real execution. Cazazza was also photographed alongside COUM Transmissions/Throbbing Gristle members Genesis P-Orridge and Cosey Fanni Tutti for the \\"Gary Gilmore Memorial Society\\" postcard, in which the three artists posed blindfolded and tied to chairs with loaded guns pointed at them to depict Gilmore's execution. In Christopher Durang's play Beyond Therapy (1983), the character Bruce claims that he \\"wanted to see Gary Gilmore executed on television.\\" See also * Capital punishment in the United States * Capital punishment in Utah * The Executioner's Song * John Albert Taylor References External links * Gary Mark Gilmore ‚Äî Summary of Execution * The Gary Gilmore Gun * Gary Gilmore on Crime Library * Category:1940 births Category:1977 deaths Category:1976 murders in the United States Category:20th-century executions by Utah Category:20th-century executions of American people Category:American people convicted of assault Category:American people convicted of murder Category:American people convicted of robbery Category:Deaths by firearm in Utah Category:Executed American people Category:Executed people from Texas Category:People convicted of murder by Utah Category:People executed by Utah by firing squad Category:People from Waco, Texas Category:People with antisocial personality disorder Category:Organ transplant donors Category:People from McCamey, Texas Category:American male criminals Category:American Roman Catholics ","title":"Gary Gilmore (criminal)"},{"id":"268508","text":"Debt consolidation is a form of debt refinancing that entails taking out one loan to pay off many others. This commonly refers to a personal finance process of individuals addressing high consumer debt, but occasionally it can also refer to a country's fiscal approach to consolidate corporate debt or Government debt. The process can secure a lower overall interest rate to the entire debt load and provide the convenience of servicing only one loan or debt. Overview Debt generally refers to money owed by one party, the debtor, to a second party, the creditor. It is generally subject to repayments of principal and interest. Interest is the fee charged by the creditor to the debtor, generally calculated as a percentage of the principal sum per year known as an interest rate and generally paid periodically at intervals, such as monthly. Debt can be secured with collateral or unsecured. Although there is variation from country to country and even in regions within country, consumer debt is primarily made up of home loans, credit card debt and car loans. Household debt is the consumer debt of the adults in the household plus the mortgage, if applicable. In many countries, especially the United States and the United Kingdom, student loans can be a significant portion of debt but are usually regulated differently than other debt. The overall debt can reach the point where a debtor is in danger of bankruptcy, insolvency, or other fiscal emergency. Options available to overburdened debtors include credit counseling and personal bankruptcy. Other consumer options include: *debt settlement, where an individual's debt is negotiated to a lesser interest rate or principal with the creditors to lessen the overall burden; *debt relief, where part or whole of an individual debt is forgiven; and *debt consolidation, where the individual is able to acquit the current debts by taking out a new loan. Sometimes the solution includes some of each of these tactics. =Process= The bulk of the consumer debt, especially that with a high interest, is repaid by a new loan. Most debt consolidation loans are offered from lending institutions and secured as a second mortgage or home equity line of credit. These require the individual to put up a home as collateral and the loan to be less than the equity available. The overall lower interest rate is an advantage that debt consolidation loan offers to consumers. Lenders have fixed costs to process payments and repayment can spread out over a larger period. However, such consolidation loans have costs: fees, interest, and \\"points\\" where one point equals to one percent of the amount borrowed. In some countries, these loans may provide certain tax advantages. Because they are secured, a lender can attempt to seize property if the borrower goes into default. Personal loans comprise another form of debt consolidation loan. Individuals can issue debtors a personal loan that satisfies the outstanding debt and creates a new one on their own terms. These loans, often unsecured, are based on the personal relationship rather than collateral. In United States, there are certain companies and private law firms, addressed as debt relief companies and/or debt consolidation companies, that provide professional debt consolidation services.https://www.ovlg.com/education/debt-consolidation-the-simple-way-out- of-the-debt-mess.html A Consumer can approach them for debt help, and make only one monthly payment to them. This payment will then be disbursed, by these companies, among the various creditors, the consumer is indebted to. Many other countries, alongside United States, also have such professional services for the benefit of consumers, struggling with household debt. Student loan consolidation In the United States, student loans which are part of the Federal Direct Student Loan Program are consolidated somewhat differently from in the UK, as federal student loans are guaranteed by the U.S. government. =United States= In a federal student loan consolidation, existing loans are purchased by the Department of Education. Upon consolidation, a fixed interest rate is set based on the then-current interest rate. Reconsolidating does not change that rate. If the student combines loans of different types and rates into one new consolidation loan, a weighted average calculation will establish the appropriate rate based on the then- current interest rates of the different loans being consolidated together. Federal student loan consolidation is often referred to as refinancing, which is incorrect because the loan rates are not changed, merely locked in. Unlike private sector debt consolidation, student loan consolidation does not incur any fees for the borrower; private companies make money on student loan consolidation by reaping subsidies from the federal government. =United Kingdom= In the UK student loan entitlements are guaranteed, and are recovered using a means-tested system from the student's future income. Student loans in the UK can not be included in bankruptcy, but do not affect a person's credit rating because the repayments are deducted from salary at source by employers, similar to Income Tax and National Insurance contributions. Many students, however, struggle with commercial debt well after their courses have finished. =Australia= Australia‚Äôs student loan system once had 35 years to pay back loans, but it‚Äôs currently 15. Those seriously delinquent on student loans face arrest at the border. =Japan= In Japan, an increasing number of student loans are in arrears. This has caused the Asian nation to take harsher steps when it comes to lending determinations. In an effort to prevent future defaults, Japan has begun associating loan approvals to academic performance.

It is the branch of economics that assesses the government revenue and government expenditure of the public authorities and the adjustment of one or the other to achieve desirable effects and avoid undesirable ones. The purview of public finance is considered to be threefold, consisting of governmental effects on:Oates, Wallace E. ‚ÄúThe Theory of Public Finance in a Federal System.‚Äù The Canadian Journal of Economics / Revue Canadienne D'Economique, vol. 1, no. 1, 1968, pp. 37‚Äì54 # The efficient allocation of available resources; # The distribution of income among citizens; and # The stability of the economy. Economist Jonathan Gruber has put forth a framework to assess the broad field of public finance.Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy (Third Edition), Worth Publishers, Pg. 3, Part 1 Gruber suggests public finance should be thought of in terms of four central questions: # When should the government intervene in the economy? To which there are two central motivations for government intervention, Market failure and redistribution of income and wealth.Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy (Third Edition), Worth Publishers, Pg. 3, Part 1 # How might the government intervene? Once the decision is made to intervene the government must choose the specific tool or policy choice to carry out the intervention (for example public provision, taxation, or subsidization).Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy (Third Edition), Worth Publishers, Pg. 6, Part 1 # What is the effect of those interventions on economic outcomes? A question to assess the empirical direct and indirect effects of specific government intervention.Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy (Third Edition), Worth Publishers, Pg. 7, Part 1 # And finally, why do governments choose to intervene in the way that they do? This question is centrally concerned with the study of political economy, theorizing how governments make public policy.Gruber, J. (2010) Public Finance and Public Policy (Third Edition), Worth Publishers, Pg. 9, Part 1 Overview The proper role of government provides a starting point for the analysis of public finance. In theory, under certain circumstances, private markets will allocate goods and services among individuals efficiently (in the sense that no waste occurs and that individual tastes are matching with the economy's productive abilities). If private markets were able to provide efficient outcomes and if the distribution of income were socially acceptable, then there would be little or no scope for government. In many cases, however, conditions for private market efficiency are violated. For example, if many people can enjoy the same good (the moment that good was produced and sold, it starts to give its utility to every one for free) at the same time (non-rival, non-excludable consumption), then private markets may supply too little of that good. National defense is one example of non-rival consumption, or of a public good. \\"Market failure\\" occurs when private markets do not allocate goods or services efficiently. The existence of market failure provides an efficiency-based rationale for collective or governmental provision of goods and services. Externalities, public goods, informational advantages, strong economies of scale, and network effects can cause market failures. Public provision via a government or a voluntary association, however, is subject to other inefficiencies, termed \\"government failure.\\" Under broad assumptions, government decisions about the efficient scope and level of activities can be efficiently separated from decisions about the design of taxation systems (Diamond-Mirrlees separation). In this view, public sector programs should be designed to maximize social benefits minus costs (cost-benefit analysis), and then revenues needed to pay for those expenditures should be raised through a taxation system that creates the fewest efficiency losses caused by distortion of economic activity as possible. In practice, government budgeting or public budgeting is substantially more complicated and often results in inefficient practices. Government can pay for spending by borrowing (for example, with government bonds), although borrowing is a method of distributing tax burdens through time rather than a replacement for taxes. A deficit is the difference between government spending and revenues. The accumulation of deficits over time is the total public debt. Deficit finance allows governments to smooth tax burdens over time and gives governments an important fiscal policy tool. Deficits can also narrow the options of successor governments. There is also a difference between public and private finance, in public finance the source of income is indirect for ex:various taxes(specific taxes,value added taxes), but in private finance sources of income is direct.businessfinancearticles.org Public finance management Collection of sufficient resources from the economy in an appropriate manner along with allocating and use of these resources efficiently and effectively constitute good financial management. Resource generation, resource allocation, and expenditure management (resource utilization) are the essential components of a public financial management system. The following subdivisions form the subject matter of public finance. # Public expenditure # Public revenue # Public debt # Financial administration # Federal finance Government expenditures Economists classify government expenditures into three main types. Government purchases of goods and services for current use are classed as government consumption. Government purchases of goods and services intended to create future benefits ‚Äì such as infrastructure investment or research spending ‚Äì are classed as government investment. Government expenditures that are not purchases of goods and services, and instead just represent transfers of money ‚Äì such as social security payments ‚Äì are called transfer payments.Robert Barro and Vittorio Grilli (1994), European Macroeconomics, Ch. 15‚Äì16. Macmillan, . =Government operations= Government operations are those activities involved in the running of a state or a functional equivalent of a state (for example, tribes, secessionist movements or revolutionary movements) for the purpose of producing value for the citizens. Government operations have the power to make, and the authority to enforce rules and laws within a civil, corporate, religious, academic, or other organization or group.Columbia Encyclopedia, Government' =Income distribution= * Income distribution ‚Äì Some forms of government expenditure are specifically intended to transfer income from some groups to others. For example, governments sometimes transfer income to people that have suffered a loss due to natural disaster. Likewise, public pension programs transfer wealth from the young to the old. Other forms of government expenditure that represent purchases of goods and services also have the effect of changing the income distribution. For example, engaging in a war may transfer wealth to certain sectors of society. Public education transfers wealth to families with children in these schools. Public road construction transfers wealth from people that do not use the roads to those people that do (and to those that build the roads). * Income Security * Employment insurance * Health Care * Public financing of campaigns Financing of government expenditures Budgeted revenues of governments in 2006. Government expenditures are financed primarily in three ways: * Government revenue ** Taxes ** Non-tax revenue (revenue from government-owned corporations, sovereign wealth funds, sales of assets, or seigniorage) * Government borrowing * Money creation How a government chooses to finance its activities can have important effects on the distribution of income and wealth (income redistribution) and on the efficiency of markets (effect of taxes on market prices and efficiency). The issue of how taxes affect income distribution is closely related to tax incidence, which examines the distribution of tax burdens after market adjustments are taken into account. Public finance research also analyzes effects of the various types of taxes and types of borrowing as well as administrative concerns, such as tax enforcement. =Taxes= Taxation is the central part of modern public finance. Its significance arises not only from the fact that it is by far the most important of all revenues but also because of the gravity of the problems created by the present day tax burden. The main objective of taxation is raising revenue. A high level of taxation is necessary in a welfare State to fulfill its obligations. Taxation is used as an instrument of attaining certain social objectives, i.e., as a means of redistribution of wealth and thereby reducing inequalities. Taxation in a modern government is thus needed not merely to raise the revenue required to meet its expenditure on administration and social services, but also to reduce the inequalities of income and wealth. Taxation might also be needed to draw away money that would otherwise go into consumption and cause inflation to rise. A tax is a financial charge or other levy imposed on an individual or a legal entity by a state or a functional equivalent of a state (for example, tribes, secessionist movements or revolutionary movements). Taxes could also be imposed by a subnational entity. Taxes consist of direct tax or indirect tax, and may be paid in money or as corv√©e labor. A tax may be defined as a \\"pecuniary burden laid upon individuals or property to support the government [ . . .] a payment exacted by legislative authority.\\"Black's Law Dictionary, p. 1307 (5th ed. 1979). A tax \\"is not a voluntary payment or donation, but an enforced contribution, exacted pursuant to legislative authority\\" and is \\"any contribution imposed by government [ . . .] whether under the name of toll, tribute, tallage, gabel, impost, duty, custom, excise, subsidy, aid, supply, or other name.\\"Id. * There are various types of taxes, broadly divided into two heads ‚Äì direct (which is proportional) and indirect tax (which is differential in nature): * Stamp duty, levied on documents * Excise tax (tax levied on production for sale, or sale, of a certain good) * Sales tax (tax on business transactions, especially the sale of goods and services) ** Value added tax (VAT) is a type of sales tax ** Services taxes on specific services * Road tax; Vehicle excise duty (UK), Registration Fee (USA), Regco (Australia), Vehicle Licensing Fee (Brazil) etc. * Gift tax * Duties (taxes on importation, levied at customs) * Corporate income tax on corporations (incorporated entities) * Wealth tax * Personal income tax (may be levied on individuals, families such as the Hindu joint family in India, unincorporated associations, etc.) =Debt= Governments, like any other legal entity, can take out loans, issue bonds, and make financial investments. Government debt (also known as public debt or national debt) is money (or credit) owed by any level of government; either central or federal government, municipal government, or local government. Some local governments issue bonds based on their taxing authority, such as tax increment bonds or revenue bonds. As the government represents the people, government debt can be seen as an indirect debt of the taxpayers. Government debt can be categorized as internal debt, owed to lenders within the country, and external debt, owed to foreign lenders. Governments usually borrow by issuing securities such as government bonds and bills. Less creditworthy countries sometimes borrow directly from commercial banks or international institutions such as the International Monetary Fund or the World Bank. Most government budgets are calculated on a cash basis, meaning that revenues are recognized when collected and outlays are recognized when paid. Some consider all government liabilities, including future pension payments and payments for goods and services the government has contracted for but not yet paid, as government debt. This approach is called accrual accounting, meaning that obligations are recognized when they are acquired, or accrued, rather than when they are paid. This constitutes public debt. =Seigniorage= Seigniorage is the net revenue derived from the issuing of currency. It arises from the difference between the face value of a coin or banknote and the cost of producing, distributing and eventually retiring it from circulation. Seigniorage is an important source of revenue for some national banks, although it provides a very small proportion of revenue for advanced industrial countries. =Public finance through state enterprise= Public finance in centrally planned economies has differed in fundamental ways from that in market economies. Some state-owned enterprises generated profits that helped finance government activities. The government entities that operate for profit are usually manufacturing and financial institutions, services such as nationalized healthcare do not operate for a profit to keep costs low for consumers. The Soviet Union relied heavily on turnover taxes on retail sales. Sale of natural resources, and especially petroleum products, were an important source of revenue for the Soviet Union. In market-oriented economies with substantial state enterprise, such as in Venezuela, the state-run oil company PSDVA provides revenue for the government to fund its operations and programs that would otherwise be profit for private owners. In various mixed economies, the revenue generated by state-run or state-owned enterprises is used for various state endeavors; typically the revenue generated by state and government agencies goes into a sovereign wealth fund. Examples of this are the Alaska Permanent Fund and Singapore's Temasek Holdings. Various market socialist systems or proposals utilize revenue generated by state-run enterprises to fund social dividends, eliminating the need for taxation altogether. Government finance statistics and methodology Macroeconomic data to support public finance economics are generally referred to as fiscal or government finance statistics (GFS). The Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) is the internationally accepted methodology for compiling fiscal data. It is consistent with regionally accepted methodologies such as the European System of Accounts 1995 and consistent with the methodology of the System of National Accounts (SNA1993) and broadly in line with its most recent update, the SNA2008. = Measuring the public sector = The size of governments, their institutional composition and complexity, their ability to carry out large and sophisticated operations, and their impact on the other sectors of the economy warrant a well-articulated system to measure government economic operations. The GFSM 2001 addresses the institutional complexity of government by defining various levels of government. The main focus of the GFSM 2001 is the general government sector defined as the group of entities capable of implementing public policy through the provision of primarily non market goods and services and the redistribution of income and wealth, with both activities supported mainly by compulsory levies on other sectors. The GFSM 2001 disaggregates the general government into subsectors: central government, state government, and local government (See Figure 1). The concept of general government does not include public corporations. The general government plus the public corporations comprise the public sector (See Figure 2). Figure 1: General Government (IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001(Washington, 2001) pp.13 Figure 2: Public Sector(IMF Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001(Washington, 2001) pp.15 The general government sector of a nation includes all non-private sector institutions, organisations and activities. The general government sector, by convention, includes all the public corporations that are not able to cover at least 50% of their costs by sales, and, therefore, are considered non-market producers.General Government sector, Eurostat glossary In the European System of Accounts,ESA95, paragraph 2.68 the sector ‚Äúgeneral government‚Äù has been defined as containing: * ‚ÄúAll institutional units which are other non-market producers whose output is intended for individual and collective consumption, and mainly financed by compulsory payments made by units belonging to other sectors, and/or all institutional units principally engaged in the redistribution of national income and wealth‚Äù. Therefore, the main functions of general government units are : * to organize or redirect the flows of money, goods and services, or other assets among corporations, among households, and between corporations and households; in the purpose of social justice, increased efficiency or other aims legitimized by the citizens -- examples are the redistribution of national income and wealth, the corporate income tax paid by companies to finance unemployment benefits, the social contributions paid by employees to finance the pension systems; * to produce goods and services to satisfy households' needs (e.g., state health care) or to collectively meet the needs of the whole community (e.g. defense, public order, and safety). The general government sector, in the European System of Accounts, has four sub-sectors: # central government # state government # local government # social security funds \\"Central government\\" Central government, Eurostat glossary consists of all administrative departments of the state and other central agencies whose responsibilities cover the whole economic territory of a country, except for the administration of social security funds. \\"State government\\" State government, Eurostat glossary is defined as the separate institutional units that exercise some government functions below those units at central government level and above those units at local government level, excluding the administration of social security funds. \\"Local government\\" Local government, Eurostat glossary consists of all types of public administration whose responsibility covers only a local part of the economic territory, apart from local agencies of social security funds. \\"Social security fund\\" Social security fund, Eurostat glossary is a central, state or local institutional unit whose main activity is to provide social benefits. It fulfils the two following criteria: * by law or regulation (except those about government employees), certain population groups must take part in the scheme and have to pay contributions; * general government is responsible for the management of the institutional unit, for the payment or approval of the level of the contributions and of the benefits, independent of its role as a supervisory body or employer. The GFSM 2001 framework is similar to the financial accounting of businesses. For example, it recommends that governments produce a full set of financial statements including the statement of government operations (akin to the income statement), the balance sheet, and a cash flow statement. Two other similarities between the GFSM 2001 and business financial accounting are the recommended use of accrual accounting as the basis of recording and the presentations of stocks of assets and liabilities at market value. It is an improvement on the prior methodology ‚Äì Government Finance Statistics Manual 1986 ‚Äì based on cash flows and without a balance sheet statement. = Users of GFS = The GFSM 2001 recommends standard tables including standard fiscal indicators that meet a broad group of users including policy makers, researchers, and investors in sovereign debt. Government finance statistics should offer data for topics such as the fiscal architecture, the measurement of the efficiency and effectiveness of government expenditures, the economics of taxation, and the structure of public financing. The GFSM 2001 provides a blueprint for the compilation, recording, and presentation of revenues, expenditures, stocks of assets, and stocks of liabilities. The GFSM 2001 also defines some indicators of effectiveness in government's expenditures, for example the compensation of employees as a percentage of expense. The GFSM 2001 includes a functional classification of expense as defined by the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) . This functional classification allows policy makers to analyze expenditures on categories such as health, education, social protection, and environmental protection. The financial statements can provide investors with the necessary information to assess the capacity of a government to service and repay its debt, a key element determining sovereign risk, and risk premia. Like the risk of default of a private corporation, sovereign risk is a function of the level of debt, its ratio to liquid assets, revenues and expenditures, the expected growth and volatility of these revenues and expenditures, and the cost of servicing the debt. The government's financial statements contain the relevant information for this analysis. The government's balance sheet presents the level of the debt; that is the government's liabilities. The memorandum items of the balance sheet provide additional information on the debt including its maturity and whether it is owed to domestic or external residents. The balance sheet also presents a disaggregated classification of financial and non-financial assets. These data help estimate the resources a government can potentially access to repay its debt. The statement of operations (‚Äúincome statement‚Äù) contains the revenue and expense accounts of the government. The revenue accounts are divided into subaccounts, including the different types of taxes, social contributions, dividends from the public sector, and royalties from natural resources. Finally, the interest expense account is one of the necessary inputs to estimate the cost of servicing the debt. = Fiscal data using the GFSM 2001 methodology = GFS can be accessible through several sources. The International Monetary Fund publishes GFS in two publications: International Financial Statistics and the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. The World Bank gathers information on external debt. On a regional level, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (Dibidami ) compiles general government account data for its members, and Eurostat, following a methodology compatible with the GFSM 2001, compiles GFS for the members of the European Union.

The concept is one of the oldest in Western philosophy, having been discussed by the likes of Heraclitus and Plato by ca. 500‚Äì400 BC. History The thought puzzle had been discussed by ancient philosophers such as Heraclitus (Cratylus 401d) and Plato (Parmenides 139) prior to Plutarch's writings, and more recently by Thomas Hobbes and John Locke. Several variants are known, including the grandfather's axe, which has had both head and handle replaced. This particular version of the thought puzzle was first introduced in Greek legend as reported by the historian, biographer, and essayist Plutarch: Plutarch thus questions whether the ship would remain the same if it were entirely replaced, piece by piece. Centuries later, the philosopher Thomas Hobbes introduced a further puzzle, wondering what would happen if the original planks were gathered up after they were replaced, and used to build a second ship.De Corpore, ch 11.7 Hobbes asked which ship, if either, would be the original Ship of Theseus. Thought experiment It is supposed that the famous ship sailed by the hero Theseus in a great battle was kept in a harbor as a museum piece, and as the years went by some of the wooden parts began to rot and were replaced by new ones; then, after a century or so, every part had been replaced. The question then is if the \\"restored\\" ship is still the same object as the original. If it is, then suppose the removed pieces were stored in a warehouse, and after the century, technology was developed that cured their rot and enabled them to be reassembled into a ship? Is this \\"reconstructed\\" ship the original ship? If it is, then what about the restored ship in the harbor still being the original ship as well? Proposed resolutions =No identity over time= This solution was first introduced by the Greek philosopher Heraclitus who attempted to solve the thought puzzle by introducing the idea of a river where water replenishes it. Arius Didymus quoted him as saying \\"upon those who step into the same rivers, different and again different waters flow\\".Didymus, Fr 39.2, Dox. gr. 471.4 Plutarch disputed Heraclitus' claim about stepping twice into the same river, citing that it cannot be done because \\"it scatters and again comes together, and approaches and recedes\\". =Four-dimensionalism= Ted Sider and others have proposed that considering objects to extend across time as four-dimensional causal series of three-dimensional \\"time-slices\\" could solve the ship of Theseus problem because, in taking such an approach, all four-dimensional objects remain numerically identical to themselves while allowing individual time-slices to differ from each other. The aforementioned river, therefore, comprises different three-dimensional time-slices of itself while remaining numerically identical to itself across time; one can never step into the same river-time-slice twice, but one can step into the same (four-dimensional) river twice.David Lewis, \\"Survival and Identity\\" in Amelie O. Rorty [ed.] The Identities of Persons (1976; U. of California P.) Reprinted in his Philosophical Papers I. =Cognitive science= According to Noam Chomsky, as described in Of Minds and Language (2009), the thought puzzle arises because of extreme externalism: the assumption that what is true in our minds is true in the world. This is not an unassailable assumption, from the perspective of the natural sciences, because human intuition is often mistaken. Cognitive science would treat this thought puzzle as the subject of a biological investigation, as a mental phenomenon internal to the human brain. Studying this human confusion can reveal much about the brain's operation, but little about the nature of the human-independent external world. =Gradual loss of identity= As the parts of the ship are replaced, the identity of the ship gradually changes, as the name \\"Theseus' Ship\\" is a truthful description only when the historical memory of Theseus' use of the ship‚Äîhis physical contact with, and control of, its matter‚Äîis accurate. For example, the museum curator, before any restoration, may say with perfect truthfulness that the bed in the captain's cabin is the same bed in which Theseus once slept; but once the bed has been replaced, this is no longer true, and the claim would then be an imposture, because a different description would be more accurate, i.e.; \\"a replica of Theseus's bed.\\" The new bed would be as foreign to Theseus as a completely new ship. This is true of every other piece of the original ship. As the parts are replaced, the new ship becomes exactly that: a new ship. Hobbes' proposed restored ship built from the original parts will be the original ship, as its parts are the actual pieces of matter that participated in Theseus's journeys. Applications The thought puzzle appears in several more applied fields of philosophy. In philosophy of mind, the ship is replaced by a person whose identity over time is called into question. In both philosophy of law and practical law, the thought puzzle appears when the ownership of an object or of the rights to its name are disagreed in court. For example, groups of people such as companies, sports teams, and musical bands may all change their parts and see their old members re-form into rivals, leading to legal actions between the old and new entities. Also, texts and computer programs may be edited gradually but so heavily that none of the original remains, posing the legal question of whether the owners of the original have any claim on the result. In ontological engineering such as the design of practical databases and AI systems, the thought puzzle appears regularly when data objects change over time. A literal example of a Ship of Theseus is DSV Alvin, a submarine that has retained its identity despite all of its components being replaced at least once. Media * In The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, the Tin Woodsman's origin story was that he was an ordinary flesh-and-blood man named Nick Chopper who gradually lost all his limbs, his torso, and finally his head, having each replaced by tin. The question of whether or not he remains the same person is brought up in a humorous fashion through the rest of the Oz series, culminating in the Tin Woodsman meeting a version of himself created from his flesh parts, with the two debating which of them is the \\"real\\" Nick Chopper. * In the Discworld novel The Fifth Elephant, King Rhys, the Low King of the Dwarfs, relates the story of how the original Scone of Stone has been replaced five times since the original dwarf bread disintegrated, making the replica the legitimate throne of the Low King. He offers his mining axe as proof of concept. Showing the lovingly crafted and maintained tool to Commander Vimes, he tells how it had once been his ancestor's axe; and when the axe's handle broke, it was replaced; and when the axe's head cracked, that also was replaced; yet, is it not still his ancestor's axe? * In the Futurama episode The Six Million Dollar Mon, Hermes is dismayed by his performance at work and his inability to protect his wife, and gradually replaces his body parts with robotic upgrades, brain last. As the parts are cast off, Zoidberg saves them to create a ventriloquists dummy. When the brain is finally added, Zoidberg has fully restored Hermes. * The name of the thought puzzle, \\"the ship of Theseus\\" is alluded to in the name of the 2013 Indian drama film Ship of Theseus. * The ship of Theseus is referred to as the name of the fictional novel in Doug Dorst's novel, S. * In the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, it is mentioned many human war machines such as tanks have had all their parts replaced due to constant battle damage over thousands of years of war. Nonetheless, the generations of pilots and crews all consider the vehicle to be the same object, even after every original part has been replaced. *In the video game Nier: Automata androids 2B and 9S help an android shopkeeper with a damaged leg to find parts. When asked why the shopkeeper does not just use parts to fix his broken leg instead of sitting in the village, the shopkeeper evokes the ideals behind the ship of Theseus. His damaged leg is his last original part. He questions: if he were to change it, would he still be the same person? *In the Only Fools and Horses episode \\"Heroes and Villains\\", Trigger wins an award for having owned the same broom for 20 years.

Lee is best known for his public relations work with the Rockefeller family. His first major client was the Pennsylvania Railroad, followed by numerous major railroads such as the New York Central, the Baltimore and Ohio, and the Harriman lines such as the Union Pacific. He established the Association of Railroad Executives, which included providing public relations services to the industry. Lee advised major industrial corporations, including steel, automobile, tobacco, meat packing, and rubber, as well as public utilities, banks, and even foreign governments. Lee pioneered the use of internal magazines to maintain employee morale, as well as management newsletters, stockholder reports, and news releases to the media. He did a great deal of pro bono work, which he knew was important to his own public image, and during World War I, he became the publicity director for the American Red Cross.Robert L. Heath, ed., Encyclopedia of public relations (2005) pp 482-86 Early life and career Ivy Lee was born near Cedartown, Georgia, the son of a Methodist minister, James Wideman Lee, author of several books and a contributor to John L. Brandt's Anglo-Saxon Supremacy, or, Race Contributions to Civilization (1915),Allen-Lee Memorial United Methodist Church: Dr James Wideman Lee biography lists Lee's books but omits this one. who founded a prominent Atlanta family. Ivy Lee studied at Emory College and then graduated from Princeton. He worked as a newspaper reporter and stringer. He was a journalist at the New York American, the New York Times, and the New York World. Lee got his first job in 1903 as a publicity manager for the Citizens Union. He authored the book The Best Administration New York City Ever Had. He later took a job with the Democratic National Committee. Lee married Cornelia Bartlett Bigalow in 1901. They had three children: Alice Lee in 1902, James Wideman Lee II in 1906, and Ivy Lee, Jr. in 1909.Princeton Together with George Parker, he established the nation's third public relations firm, Parker and Lee, in 1905. The new agency boasted of \\"Accuracy, Authenticity, and Interest.\\" It made this partnership after working together in the Democratic Party headquarters, handling publicity for Judge Alton Parker's unsuccessful presidential race against Theodore Roosevelt in 1904. The Parker and Lee firm lasted less than four years, but the junior partner, Lee, was to become one of the most influential pioneers in public relations. He evolved his philosophy in 1906 into the Declaration of Principles, the first articulation of the concept that public relations practitioners have a public responsibility that extends beyond obligations to the client. In the same year, after the 1906 Atlantic City train wreck, Lee issued what is often considered to be the first press release, after persuading the company to disclose information to journalists before they could hear it elsewhere. When Lee was hired full-time by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1912, he was considered to be the first public relations person placed in an executive-level position. In fact, his archives reveal that he drafted one of the first job descriptions of a VP-level corporate public relations position. In 1919, he founded a public relations counseling office, Ivy Lee & Associates. During World War I, Lee served as a publicity director, and later as Assistant to the Chairman of the American Red Cross. Through his sister Laura, Lee was an uncle to novelist William S. Burroughs. Ivy Lee died of a brain tumor at the age of 57. Effect on public relations Many historians credit Lee with being the originator of modern crisis communications. His principal competitor in the new public relations industry was Edward Bernays, and he has been credited with influencing Pendleton Dudley to enter the then-nascent field. In 1914 he was to enter public relations on a much larger scale when he was retained by John D. Rockefeller Jr to represent his family and Standard Oil (\\"to burnish the family image\\"), after their bloody repression of the coal mining strike in Colorado known as the \\"Ludlow Massacre.\\" Lee warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support due to having ordered the massacre of striking workers and their families (as well as the burning of their homes). He developed a strategy that Junior followed to repair it. It was necessary for Junior to overcome his shyness, go personally to Colorado to meet with the miners and their families, inspect the conditions of the homes and the factories, attend social events, and listen to the grievances (all the while being photographed for press releases). This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention, which opened the way to wallpaper over the conflict, and present a more humanized version of the wealthy Rockefellers.Robert L. Heath, ed. Encyclopedia of public relations (2005) 1:485 Lee guided public relations of Rockefellers and their corporate interests, including a strong involvement in the construction of the Rockefeller Center, even after he moved on to set up his own consulting firm. He was the person who brought the original, unfunded plan for Metropolitan Opera's expansion to Junior's attention, and he convinced Junior to rename the center after the family against the latter's wishes. Lee became an inaugural member of the Council on Foreign Relations in the US when it was established in New York in 1921. In the early 1920s, he promoted friendly relations with Soviet Russia. In 1926, Lee wrote a famous letter to the president of the US Chamber of Commerce in which he presented a convincing argument for the need to normalize US-Soviet political and economic relations. His supposed instruction to the son of the Standard Oil fortune was to echo in public relations henceforth: \\"Tell the truth, because sooner or later the public will find out anyway. And if the public doesn't like what you are doing, change your policies and bring them into line with what people want.\\" The context of the quote was said to be apocryphal, being spread by Lee as self-promotion, making it both famous and infamous. Lee is considered to be the father of the modern public relations campaign when, from 1913‚Äì1914, he successfully lobbied for a railroad rate increase from a reluctant federal government. Lee espoused a philosophy consistent with what has sometimes been called the \\"two-way street\\" approach to public relations, in which PR consists of helping clients listen as well as communicate messages to their publics. In practice, however, Lee often engaged in one-way propagandizing on behalf of clients despised by the public. Shortly before his death in 1934, the US Congress had been investigating his work in Nazi Germany on behalf of the company IG Farben. Lee also worked for the Bethlehem Steel Corporation, in which capacity he famously advised managers to list and number their top priorities every day, and work on tasks in the order of their importance until daily time allows, not proceeding until a task was completed. For this suggestion company head Charles M. Schwab later paid him $25,000 (the equivalent of $400,000 in 2016 dollars), saying it had been the most profitable advice he had received..

Schwab (1862‚Äì1939) and Ivy Lee (1877‚Äì1934). Earl Nightingale appears in the book A Lifetime of Riches: The Biography of Napoleon Hill, by Michael J. Ritt, Jr. and Kirk Landers, because of Nightingale's relationship with Napoleon Hill. Over his career he also was a public relations advisor to George Westinghouse, Charles Lindbergh, John W.

The battle was fought not far from the site of Zir'in, a now-destroyed Palestinian village in present-day Israel. The battle marked the height of the extent of Mongol conquests, and was the first time a Mongol advance had ever been permanently beaten back in direct combat on the battlefield. Continuing the westward expansion of the Mongol Empire, the armies of Hulagu Khan captured and sacked Baghdad in 1258, along with the Ayyubid capital of Damascus sometime later. Hulagu sent envoys to Cairo demanding Qutuz surrender Egypt, to which Qutuz responded by killing the envoys and displaying their heads on the Bab Zuweila gate of Cairo. Shortly after this, Hulagu returned to Mongolia with the bulk of his army in accordance with Mongol customs, leaving approximately 10,000 troops west of the Euphrates under the command of general Kitbuqa. Learning of these developments, Qutuz quickly advanced his army from Cairo towards Palestine. Kitbuqa sacked Sidon, before turning his army south towards the Spring of Harod to meet Qutuz' forces. Using hit-and-run tactics and a feigned retreat by Mamluk general Baibars, combined with a final flanking maneuver by Qutuz, the Mongol army was pushed in a retreat toward Bisan, after which the Mamluks led a final counterattack, which resulted in the death of several Mongol troops, along with Kitbuqa himself. The battle has been cited as the first time the Mongols were permanently prevented from expanding their influence, and also incorrectly cited as the first major Mongol defeat. It also marked the first of two defeats the Mongols would face in their attempts to invade Egypt and the Levant, the other being the Battle of Marj al-Saffar in 1303. The earliest known use of the hand cannon in any military conflict is also documented to have taken place in this battle by the Mamluks, who used it to frighten the Mongol armies, according to Arabic military treatises of the 13th and 14th centuries. Background When M√∂ngke Khan became Great Khan in 1251, he immediately set out to implement his grandfather Genghis Khan's plan for a world empire. To lead the task of subduing the nations in the West, he selected his brother, another of Genghis Khan's grandsons, Hulagu Khan. Assembling the army took five years, and it was not until 1256 that Hulagu was prepared to begin the invasions. Operating from the Mongol base in Persia, Hulagu proceeded south. M√∂ngke had ordered good treatment for those who yielded without resistance and destruction for the rest. In that way, Hulagu and his army had conquered some of the most powerful and longstanding dynasties of the time. Other countries in the Mongols' path submitted to Mongol authority and contributed forces to the Mongol army. When the Mongols had reached Baghdad, their army included Cilician Armenians and even some Frankish forces from the submissive Principality of Antioch. The Assassins in Persia fell, the 500-year-old Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad was destroyed (see Battle of Baghdad) and the Ayyubid dynasty in Damascus fell as well. Hulagu's plan was then to proceed southwards through the Kingdom of Jerusalem towards the Mamluk Sultanate, to confront the major Islamic power. During the Mongol attack on the Mamluks in the Middle East, most of the Mamluks were Kipchaks, and the Golden Horde's supply of Kipchaks replenished the Mamluk armies and helped them fight off the Mongols.Halperin, Charles J. 2000. \\"The Kipchak Connection: The Ilkhans, the Mamluks and Ayn Jalut\\".

Nour Foundation. and a handful of vassal troops under the Naiman Nestorian Christian general Kitbuqa Noyan, commonly known as Kitbuqa. Contemporary Mamluk chronicler Al-Yunini's Dhayl Mirat Al-Zaman states that the Mongol army under Kitbuqa, including vassals, numbered 100,000 men in total, but this was likely an exaggeration.Yunini, \\"Dhayl,\\" Vol. 4, p. 93. Until the late 20th century, historians believed that Hulagu's sudden retreat had been caused by the power dynamic having been changed by the death of the Great Khan M√∂ngke on an expedition to the Song dynasty's China, which made Hulagu and other senior Mongols return home to decide his successor. However, contemporary documentation discovered in the 1980s reveals that to be untrue, as Hulagu himself claimed that he withdrew most of his forces because he could not sustain such a large army logistically, that the fodder in the region had been mostly used up and that a Mongol custom was to withdraw to cooler lands for the summer.Paul Meyvaert, ‚ÄúAn Unknown Letter of Hulagu, Il-khan of Persia, to King Louis IX of France,‚Äù Viator 11 (1980): 258; 249: \\"Since it is our custom to prefer the cooler places of the snowy mountains in the heat of summer, we decided to return for a while to the mountains of Greater Armenia, especially as the greater part of the food and fodder had been consumed after the devastation of Aleppo and Damacsus. However, we left a few of our men behind to destroy any Assassin strongholds that were still standing. They lay in hiding because they were so few in number and the Babylonian dog mice came out of their caves and attacked them. Some, who disobeyed our orders, invaded French possessions and, receiving their deserts, were bitten by the aforementioned mice. Although revenge on these recreants would please us somewhat, and they have not caused any real harm, it is nevertheless our intention shortly to complete our plan against the said infidel Babylonians of the canine race exactly as we did against the other rebels.\\" = Qutuz' advance into Palestine = Upon receiving news of Hulagu's departure, Mamluk Sultan Qutuz quickly assembled a large army at Cairo and invaded Palestine.p. 424, 'The Collins Encyclopedia of Military History' (4th edition, 1993), Dupuy & Dupuy, In late August, Kitbuqa's forces proceeded south from their base at Baalbek, passing to the east of Lake Tiberias into Lower Galilee. Qutuz was then allied with a fellow Mamluk, Baibars, who chose to ally himself with Qutuz in the face of a greater enemy after the Mongols had captured Damascus and most of Bilad ash-Sham. = Mongol invasion of the crusader states = The Mongols attempted to form a Franco-Mongol alliance or at least to demand the submission of the remnant of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem, now centered on Acre; but Pope Alexander IV had forbidden it. Tensions between the Franks and the Mongols had also increased when Julian of Sidon caused an incident which resulted in the death of one of Kitbuqa's grandsons. Angered, Kitbuqa sacked Sidon. The Barons of Acre and the remainder of the Crusader outposts, contacted by the Mongols, had also been approached by the Mamluks and sought military assistance against the Mongols. Though the Mamluks were the traditional enemies of the Franks, the Barons of Acre recognised the Mongols as the more immediate menace and so the Crusaders opted for a position of cautious neutrality between the two forces.Morgan, p. 137. In an unusual move, they agreed that the Egyptian Mamluks could march north through the Crusader states unmolested and even camp to resupply near Acre. When news arrived that the Mongols had crossed the Jordan River, Sultan Qutuz and his forces proceeded southeast, toward the site known in Arabic as \\"the Spring of Goliath\\" (Ain Jalut), in the Jezreel Valley, today called the Spring of Harod in Hebrew.Bartlett, p. 253 Battle The first to advance were the Mongols, whose force also included troops from the Kingdom of Georgia and about 500 troops from the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, both of which had submitted to Mongol authority. The Mamluks had the advantage of knowing the terrain, and Qutuz capitalized on that by hiding the bulk of his force in the highlands and hoping to bait the Mongols with a smaller force, under Baibars. Both armies fought for many hours, with Baibars usually implementing hit-and-run tactics to provoke the Mongol troops and to preserve the bulk of his troops intact. When the Mongols carried out another heavy assault, Baibars, who it is said had laid out the overall strategy of the battle since he had spent much time in that region earlier in his life as a fugitive, and his men feigned a final retreat to draw the Mongols into the highlands to be ambushed by the rest of the Mamluk forces concealed among the trees. The Mongol leader, Kitbuqa, already provoked by the constant fleeing of Baibars and his troops, committed a grave mistake. Instead of suspecting a trick, Kitbuqa decided to march forward with all of his troops on the trail of the fleeing Mamluks. When the Mongols reached the highlands, Mamluk forces emerged from hiding and began to fire arrows and attack with their cavalry. The Mongols then found themselves surrounded on all sides. Additionally, Timothy May hypothesizes that a key moment in the battle was the defection of the Mongol Syrian allies.Timothy May, the Mongol Art of War (2016). The Mongol army fought very fiercely and very aggressively to break out. Some distance away, Qutuz watched with his private legion. When Qutuz saw the left wing of the Mamluk army almost destroyed by the desperate Mongols seeking an escape route, he threw away his combat helmet, so that his warriors could recognize him. He was seen the next moment rushing fiercely towards the battlefield yelling wa islamah! (\\"Oh my Islam\\"), urging his army to keep firm and advancing towards the weakened side, followed by his own unit. The Mongols were pushed back and fled to a vicinity of Beisan, followed by Qutuz's forces, but they managed to reorganize and to return to the battlefield, making a successful counterattack. However, the battle shifted toward the Mamluks, who now had both the geographic and psychological advantage, and some of the Mongols were eventually forced to retreat. Kitbuqa, with almost the rest of the Mongol army that had remained in the region, perished. Aftermath Hulagu Khan ordered the execution of the last Ayyubid emir of Aleppo and Damascus, An-Nasir Yusuf and his brother, who were in captivity, after he heard the news of the defeat of the Mongol army at Ain Jalut. However, the Mamluks captured Damascus five days later after Ain Jalut, followed by Aleppo within a month. On the way back to Cairo after the victory at Ain Jalut, Qutuz was assassinated by several emirs in a conspiracy led by Baibars.Although medieval historians give conflicting accounts, modern historians assign responsibility for Qutuz's assassination to Baibars, as Baibars had been promised Syria as a reward for his efforts in Ain Jalut, but when it was time to claim his prize, Qutuz commanded him to be patient. See Perry (p. 150), Amitai-Preiss (p. 47, \\"a conspiracy of amirs, which included Baybars and was probably under his leadership\\"), Holt et al. (Baibars \\"came to power with [the] regicide [of Qutuz] on his conscience\\"), and Tschanz. For further discussion, see article on \\"Qutuz\\". Baibars became the new Sultan. Local Ayyubid emirs sworn to the Mamluk sultanate subsequently defeated another Mongol force of 6,000 at Homs, which ended the first Mongol expedition into Syria. Baibars and his successors would go on to capture the last of the crusader states in the Holy Land by 1291. Internecine conflict prevented Hulagu Khan from being able to bring his full power against the Mamluks to avenge the pivotal defeat at Ain Jalut. Berke Khan, the Khan of the Golden Horde to the north of Ilkhanate, had converted to Islam and watched with horror as his cousin destroyed the Abbasid Caliph, the spiritual and administrative center of Islam. The Muslim historian Rashid-al-Din Hamadani quoted Berke as sending the following message to Mongke Khan, protesting the attack on Baghdad since he did not know that Mongke had died in China: \\"He (Hulagu) has sacked all the cities of the Muslims, and has brought about the death of the Caliph. With the help of God I will call him to account for so much innocent blood.\\"The Mongol Warlords quotes Rashid al Din's record of Berke Khan's pronouncement; the quote is also found in Amitai-Preiss's The Mamluk-Ilkhanid War. The Mamluks, learning through spies that Berke was a Muslim and was not fond of his cousin, were careful to nourish their ties to him and his Khanate. Later on, Hulagu was able to send only a small army of two tumens in his sole attempt to attack the Mamluks in Aleppo in December 1260. They were able to massacre a large number of Muslims in retaliation for the death of Kitbuqa, but after a fortnight could make no other progress and had to retreat. After the Mongol succession was finally settled, with Kublai as the last Great Khan, Hulagu returned to his lands by 1262 and massed his armies to attack the Mamluks and avenge Ain Jalut. However, Berke Khan initiated a series of raids in force that lured Hulagu north, away from the Levant, to meet him. Hulagu suffered a severe defeat in an attempted invasion north of the Caucasus in 1263. That was the first open war among the Mongols and signaled the end of the unified empire. Hulagu Khan died in 1265 and was succeeded by his son Abaqa. Legacy The large number of sources in vastly- different languages caused Mongol historians have generally focused on one limited aspect of the empire. From that standpoint, the Battle of Ain Jalut has been represented by numerous academic and popular historians as an epochal battle that was the first time that the Mongol advance had been permanently halted and even their first major defeat. Jack Weatherford, Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World. However, Ain Jalut, placed in the broader scope of the Mongol conquests in more comprehensive recent research, was actually not a first defeat or as pivotal as earlier histories portrayed it to be. The Mongols had been defeated several times before Ain Jalut, not even including Genghis' defeats to Jamuqa and the Kerait's during the Mongol wars of unification. Mongol General Boro'qul was ambushed and killed by the Siberian Tumad tribe between 1215 and 1217, which prompted Genghis to send Dorbei Doqshin, who outmaneuvered and captured the Tumad tribe.Timothy May, The Mongol Empire: A Historical Encyclopedia, 203-4. In 1221, Shigi Qutugu was defeated by Jalal al-Din during the Mongol conquest of the Khwarezmian Empire at the Battle of Parwan. As a result, Genghis Khan himself made forced marches to bring the Sultan Jalal al-Din to battle and annihilated him at the Battle of Indus. During the initial reign of Ogedei Khan, his general, Dolqolqu, was heavily defeated by the Jin generals Wan Yen-Yi and Pu'a. In response, Ogedei dispatched the legendary Subutai, and after encountering fierce resistance, the Mongols brought their entire army to bear under a vast encirclement of the Jin Empire by separate armies under Ogedei, Tolui and Subutai.Christopher P. Atwood, Pu'a's Boast and Doqolqu's Death: Historiography of a Hidden Scandal in the Mongol Conquest of the Jin. The Jin armies were decisively defeated and Subutai conquered Kaifeng in 1233, effectively dooming the Jin Dynasty. Additionally, Ain Jalut did not mark the limit of Mongol expansion or show an end to their conquests. In 1299, the Ilkhanid army, under Ghazan Khan, decisively defeated the Mamluks at Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, capturing Damascus and pursuing as far as Gaza. However, a combination of poor pasturage and the ongoing war against the Chagatai Khanate forced Ghazan to recall his army to northeastern Iran. After that campaign ended, he sent another smaller force back into Syria, but it was defeated at the much more important Battle of Marj al-Saffar (1303). It was that battle that marked the limits of Mongol expansion. The war against the Chagataids and his failing health prevented Ghazan from launching a counteroffensive before he died in 1305. Put in proper perspective, Ain Jalut was actually the first time a Mongol detachment was defeated and did not immediately return with a stronger army to avenge its loss. Though it was only a minor defeat in the grand scheme, it showed a problem that would continually plague future Mongol attempts at expansion. Mongol forces looking to attack or exact revenge were often diverted by the death of a key Khan or by giving greater priority to fighting off opposing Mongol khanates. According to Arabic military treatises of the 13th and 14th centuries, hand cannon was used by the Mamluk side in the Battle of Ain Jalut to frighten the Mongol armies, making it the earliest known battle for hand cannon being used. The compositions of the gunpowder used in the cannon were also given in those manuals. (Part 4 and Part 5) In fiction Robert Shea's historical novel The Saracen deals extensively with the Battle of Ain Jalut and the subsequent assassination of Sultan Qutuz.

Antivirus software was originally developed to detect and remove computer viruses, hence the name. However, with the proliferation of other kinds of malware, antivirus software started to provide protection from other computer threats. In particular, modern antivirus software can protect users from: malicious browser helper objects (BHOs), browser hijackers, ransomware, keyloggers, backdoors, rootkits, trojan horses, worms, malicious LSPs, dialers, fraudtools, adware and spyware. Some products also include protection from other computer threats, such as infected and malicious URLs, spam, scam and phishing attacks, online identity (privacy), online banking attacks, social engineering techniques, advanced persistent threat (APT) and botnet DDoS attacks.  History  = 1949‚Äì1980 period (pre-antivirus days) = Although the roots of the computer virus date back as early as 1949, when the Hungarian scientist John von Neumann published the \\"Theory of self-reproducing automata\\",von Neumann, John (1966) Theory of self-reproducing automata . University of Illinois Press. the first known computer virus appeared in 1971 and was dubbed the \\"Creeper virus\\". This computer virus infected Digital Equipment Corporation's (DEC) PDP-10 mainframe computers running the TENEX operating system.From the first email to the first YouTube video: a definitive internet history . Tom Meltzer and Sarah Phillips. The Guardian. October 23, 2009IEEE Annals of the History of Computing, Volumes 27‚Äì28. IEEE Computer Society, 2005. 74 : \\"[...]from one machine to another led to experimentation with the Creeper program, which became the world's first computer worm: a computation that used the network to recreate itself on another node, and spread from node to node.\\" The Creeper virus was eventually deleted by a program created by Ray Tomlinson and known as \\"The Reaper\\". Some people consider \\"The Reaper\\" the first antivirus software ever written ‚Äì it may be the case, but it is important to note that the Reaper was actually a virus itself specifically designed to remove the Creeper virus. The Creeper virus was followed by several other viruses. The first known that appeared \\"in the wild\\" was \\"Elk Cloner\\", in 1981, which infected Apple II computers. In 1983, the term \\"computer virus\\" was coined by Fred Cohen in one of the first ever published academic papers on computer viruses.Fred Cohen: \\"Computer Viruses ‚Äì Theory and Experiments\\" (1983) . Eecs.umich.edu (November 3, 1983). Retrieved on 2017-01-03. Cohen used the term \\"computer virus\\" to describe a program that: \\"affect other computer programs by modifying them in such a way as to include a (possibly evolved) copy of itself.\\" (note that a more recent, and precise, definition of computer virus has been given by the Hungarian security researcher P√©ter Sz≈ër: \\"a code that recursively replicates a possibly evolved copy of itself\\"). The first IBM PC compatible \\"in the wild\\" computer virus, and one of the first real widespread infections, was \\"Brain\\" in 1986. From then, the number of viruses has grown exponentially. Most of the computer viruses written in the early and mid-1980s were limited to self-reproduction and had no specific damage routine built into the code. That changed when more and more programmers became acquainted with computer virus programming and created viruses that manipulated or even destroyed data on infected computers. Before internet connectivity was widespread, computer viruses were typically spread by infected floppy disks. Antivirus software came into use, but was updated relatively infrequently. During this time, virus checkers essentially had to check executable files and the boot sectors of floppy disks and hard disks. However, as internet usage became common, viruses began to spread online. = 1980‚Äì1990 period (early days) = There are competing claims for the innovator of the first antivirus product. Possibly, the first publicly documented removal of an \\"in the wild\\" computer virus (i.e. the \\"Vienna virus\\") was performed by Bernd Fix in 1987.Kaspersky Lab Virus list. viruslist.com In 1987, Andreas L√ºning and Kai Figge, who founded G Data Software in 1985, released their first antivirus product for the Atari ST platform. In 1987, the Ultimate Virus Killer (UVK) was also released. This was the de facto industry standard virus killer for the Atari ST and Atari Falcon, the last version of which (version 9.0) was released in April 2004. In 1987, in the United States, John McAfee founded the McAfee company (was part of Intel Security) and, at the end of that year, he released the first version of VirusScan. Also in 1987 (in Czechoslovakia), Peter Pa≈°ko, Rudolf Hrub√Ω, and Miroslav Trnka created the first version of NOD antivirus. In 1987, Fred Cohen wrote that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible computer viruses.Cohen, Fred, An Undetectable Computer Virus (Archived), 1987, IBM Finally, at the end of 1987, the first two heuristic antivirus utilities were released: Flushot Plus by Ross Greenberg and Anti4us by Erwin Lanting. In his O'Reilly book, Malicious Mobile Code: Virus Protection for Windows, Roger Grimes described Flushot Plus as \\"the first holistic program to fight malicious mobile code (MMC).\\" However, the kind of heuristic used by early AV engines was totally different from those used today. The first product with a heuristic engine resembling modern ones was F-PROT in 1991. Early heuristic engines were based on dividing the binary in different sections: data section, code section (in a legitimate binary, it usually starts always from the same location). Indeed, the initial viruses re-organized the layout of the sections, or overrode the initial portion of section in order to jump to the very end of the file where malicious code was located‚Äîonly going back to resume execution of the original code. This was a very specific pattern, not used at the time by any legitimate software, which represented an elegant heuristic to catch suspicious code. Other kinds of more advanced heuristics were later added, such as suspicious section names, incorrect header size, regular expressions, and partial pattern in-memory matching. In 1988, the growth of antivirus companies continued. In Germany, Tjark Auerbach founded Avira (H+BEDV at the time) and released the first version of AntiVir (named \\"Luke Filewalker\\" at the time). In Bulgaria, Vesselin Bontchev released his first freeware antivirus program (he later joined FRISK Software). Also Frans Veldman released the first version of ThunderByte Antivirus, also known as TBAV (he sold his company to Norman Safeground in 1998). In Czechoslovakia, Pavel Baudi≈° and Eduard Kuƒçera started avast! (at the time ALWIL Software) and released their first version of avast! antivirus. In June 1988, in South Korea, Ahn Cheol-Soo released its first antivirus software, called V1 (he founded AhnLab later in 1995). Finally, in the Autumn 1988, in United Kingdom, Alan Solomon founded S&S; International and created his Dr. Solomon's Anti- Virus Toolkit (although he launched it commercially only in 1991 ‚Äì in 1998 Solomon's company was acquired by McAfee). In November 1988 a professor at the Panamerican University in Mexico City named Alejandro E. Carriles copyrighted the first antivirus software in Mexico under the name \\"Byte Matabichos\\" (Byte Bugkiller) to help solve the rampant virus infestation among students.Direccion General del Derecho de Autor, SEP, Mexico D.F. Registry 20709/88 Book 8, page 40, dated November 24, 1988. Also in 1988, a mailing list named VIRUS-L was started on the BITNET/EARN network where new viruses and the possibilities of detecting and eliminating viruses were discussed. Some members of this mailing list were: Alan Solomon, Eugene Kaspersky (Kaspersky Lab), Fri√∞rik Sk√∫lason (FRISK Software), John McAfee (McAfee), Luis Corrons (Panda Security), Mikko Hypp√∂nen (F-Secure), P√©ter Sz≈ër, Tjark Auerbach (Avira) and Vesselin Bontchev (FRISK Software). In 1989, in Iceland, Fri√∞rik Sk√∫lason created the first version of F-PROT Anti-Virus back in 1989 (he founded FRISK Software only in 1993). In the meanwhile, in United States, Symantec (founded by Gary Hendrix in 1982) launched its first Symantec antivirus for Macintosh (SAM).SAM Identifies Virus-Infected Files, Repairs Applications, InfoWorld, May 22, 1989 SAM 2.0, released March 1990, incorporated technology allowing users to easily update SAM to intercept and eliminate new viruses, including many that didn't exist at the time of the program's release.SAM Update Lets Users Program for New Viruses, InfoWorld, February 19, 1990 In the end of the 1980s, in United Kingdom, Jan Hruska and Peter Lammer founded the security firm Sophos and began producing their first antivirus and encryption products. In the same period, in Hungary, also VirusBuster was founded (which has recently being incorporated by Sophos). = 1990‚Äì2000 period (emergence of the antivirus industry) = In 1990, in Spain, Mikel Urizarbarrena founded Panda Security (Panda Software at the time). In Hungary, the security researcher P√©ter Sz≈ër released the first version of Pasteur antivirus. In Italy, Gianfranco Tonello created the first version of VirIT eXplorer antivirus, then founded TG Soft one year later. In 1990, the Computer Antivirus Research Organization (CARO) was founded. In 1991, CARO released the \\"Virus Naming Scheme\\", originally written by Fri√∞rik Sk√∫lason and Vesselin Bontchev. Although this naming scheme is now outdated, it remains the only existing standard that most computer security companies and researchers ever attempted to adopt. CARO members includes: Alan Solomon, Costin Raiu, Dmitry Gryaznov, Eugene Kaspersky, Fri√∞rik Sk√∫lason, Igor Muttik, Mikko Hypp√∂nen, Morton Swimmer, Nick FitzGerald, Padgett Peterson, Peter Ferrie, Righard Zwienenberg and Vesselin Bontchev.CAROids, Hamburg 2003 In 1991, in the United States, Symantec released the first version of Norton AntiVirus. In the same year, in the Czech Republic, Jan Gritzbach and Tom√°≈° Hofer founded AVG Technologies (Grisoft at the time), although they released the first version of their Anti-Virus Guard (AVG) only in 1992. On the other hand, in Finland, F-Secure (founded in 1988 by Petri Allas and Risto Siilasmaa ‚Äì with the name of Data Fellows) released the first version of their antivirus product. F-Secure claims to be the first antivirus firm to establish a presence on the World Wide Web. In 1991, the European Institute for Computer Antivirus Research (EICAR) was founded to further antivirus research and improve development of antivirus software. In 1992, in Russia, Igor Danilov released the first version of SpiderWeb, which later became Dr. Web. In 1994, AV-TEST reported that there were 28,613 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database.[In 1994, AV-Test.org reported 28,613 unique malware samples (based on MD5). \\"A Brief History of Malware; The First 25 Years\\"] Over time other companies were founded. In 1996, in Romania, Bitdefender was founded and released the first version of Anti-Virus eXpert (AVX). In 1997, in Russia, Eugene Kaspersky and Natalya Kaspersky co-founded security firm Kaspersky Lab. In 1996, there was also the first \\"in the wild\\" Linux virus, known as \\"Staog\\". In 1999, AV-TEST reported that there were 98,428 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database. = 2000‚Äì2005 period = In 2000, Rainer Link and Howard Fuhs started the first open source antivirus engine, called OpenAntivirus Project. In 2001, Tomasz Kojm released the first version of ClamAV, the first ever open source antivirus engine to be commercialised. In 2007, ClamAV was bought by Sourcefire, which in turn was acquired by Cisco Systems in 2013. In 2002, in United Kingdom, Morten Lund and Theis S√∏ndergaard co-founded the antivirus firm BullGuard.Der Unternehmer ‚Äì brand eins online . Brandeins.de (July 2009). Retrieved on January 3, 2017. In 2005, AV-TEST reported that there were 333,425 unique malware samples (based on MD5) in their database. = 2005‚Äì2014 period = In 2007, AV-TEST reported a number of 5,490,960 new unique malware samples (based on MD5) only for that year. In 2012 and 2013, antivirus firms reported a new malware samples range from 300,000 to over 500,000 per day. Over the years it has become necessary for antivirus software to use several different strategies (e.g. specific email and network protection or low level modules) and detection algorithms, as well as to check an increasing variety of files, rather than just executables, for several reasons: * Powerful macros used in word processor applications, such as Microsoft Word, presented a risk. Virus writers could use the macros to write viruses embedded within documents. This meant that computers could now also be at risk from infection by opening documents with hidden attached macros. * The possibility of embedding executable objects inside otherwise non-executable file formats can make opening those files a risk. * Later email programs, in particular Microsoft's Outlook Express and Outlook, were vulnerable to viruses embedded in the email body itself. A user's computer could be infected by just opening or previewing a message. In 2005, F-Secure was the first security firm that developed an Anti-Rootkit technology, called BlackLight. Because most users are usually connected to the Internet on a continual basis, Jon Oberheide first proposed a Cloud-based antivirus design in 2008. In February 2008 McAfee Labs added the industry-first cloud-based anti-malware functionality to VirusScan under Artemis name. It was tested by AV-Comparatives in February 2008McAfee Artemis Preview Report . av- comparatives.org and officially unveiled in August 2008 in McAfee VirusScan.McAfee Third Quarter 2008 . corporate-ir.net Cloud AV created problems for comparative testing of security software ‚Äì part of the AV definitions was out of testers control (on constantly updated AV company servers) thus making results non-repeatable. As a result, Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organisation (AMTSO) started working on method of testing cloud products which was adopted on May 7, 2009. In 2011, AVG introduced a similar cloud service, called Protective Cloud Technology. = 2014‚Äìpresent (rise of next-gen) = Following the 2013 release of the APT 1 report from Mandiant, the industry has seen a shift towards signature-less approaches to the problem capable of detecting and mitigating zero-day attacks. Numerous approaches to address these new forms of threats have appeared, including behavioral detection, artificial intelligence, machine learning, and cloud-based file detonation. According to Gartner, it is expected the rise of new entrants, such Carbon Black, Cylance and Crowdstrike will force EPP incumbents into a new phase of innovation and acquisition. One method from Bromium involves micro-virtualization to protect desktops from malicious code execution initiated by the end user. Another approach from SentinelOne and Carbon Black focuses on behavioral detection by building a full context around every process execution path in real time, while Cylance leverages an artificial intelligence model based on machine learning. Increasingly, these signature- less approaches have been defined by the media and analyst firms as \\"next- generation\\" antivirus and are seeing rapid market adoption as certified antivirus replacement technologies by firms such as Coalfire and DirectDefense. In response, traditional antivirus vendors such as Trend Micro, Symantec and Sophos have responded by incorporating \\"next-gen\\" offerings into their portfolios as analyst firms such as Forrester and Gartner have called traditional signature-based antivirus \\"ineffective\\" and \\"outdated\\".The Forrester Wave‚Ñ¢: Endpoint Security Suites, Q4 2016 . Forrester.com (October 19, 2016). Retrieved on 2017-01-03.  Identification methods  One of the few solid theoretical results in the study of computer viruses is Frederick B. Cohen's 1987 demonstration that there is no algorithm that can perfectly detect all possible viruses. However, using different layers of defense, a good detection rate may be achieved. There are several methods which antivirus engine can use to identify malware: * Sandbox detection: a particular behavioural-based detection technique that, instead of detecting the behavioural fingerprint at run time, it executes the programs in a virtual environment, logging what actions the program performs. Depending on the actions logged, the antivirus engine can determine if the program is malicious or not.Sandboxing Protects Endpoints  Stay Ahead Of Zero Day Threats . Enterprise.comodo.com (June 20, 2014). Retrieved on 2017-01-03. If not, then, the program is executed in the real environment. Albeit this technique has shown to be quite effective, given its heaviness and slowness, it is rarely used in end-user antivirus solutions. * Data mining techniques: one of the latest approaches applied in malware detection. Data mining and machine learning algorithms are used to try to classify the behaviour of a file (as either malicious or benign) given a series of file features, that are extracted from the file itself.Kiem, Hoang; Thuy, Nguyen Yhanh and Quang, Truong Minh Nhat (December 2004) \\"A Machine Learning Approach to Anti-virus System\\", Joint Workshop of Vietnamese Society of AI, SIGKBS-JSAI, ICS-IPSJ and IEICE-SIGAI on Active Mining ; Session 3: Artificial Intelligence, Vol. 67, pp. 61‚Äì65 = Signature-based detection = Traditional antivirus software relies heavily upon signatures to identify malware. Substantially, when a malware arrives in the hands of an antivirus firm, it is analysed by malware researchers or by dynamic analysis systems. Then, once it is determined to be a malware, a proper signature of the file is extracted and added to the signatures database of the antivirus software.Automatic Malware Signature Generation . (PDF) . Retrieved on January 3, 2017. Although the signature- based approach can effectively contain malware outbreaks, malware authors have tried to stay a step ahead of such software by writing \\"oligomorphic\\", \\"polymorphic\\" and, more recently, \\"metamorphic\\" viruses, which encrypt parts of themselves or otherwise modify themselves as a method of disguise, so as to not match virus signatures in the dictionary. = Heuristics = Many viruses start as a single infection and through either mutation or refinements by other attackers, can grow into dozens of slightly different strains, called variants. Generic detection refers to the detection and removal of multiple threats using a single virus definition. For example, the Vundo trojan has several family members, depending on the antivirus vendor's classification. Symantec classifies members of the Vundo family into two distinct categories, Trojan.Vundo and Trojan.Vundo.B. While it may be advantageous to identify a specific virus, it can be quicker to detect a virus family through a generic signature or through an inexact match to an existing signature. Virus researchers find common areas that all viruses in a family share uniquely and can thus create a single generic signature. These signatures often contain non-contiguous code, using wildcard characters where differences lie. These wildcards allow the scanner to detect viruses even if they are padded with extra, meaningless code. A detection that uses this method is said to be \\"heuristic detection.\\" = Rootkit detection = Anti-virus software can attempt to scan for rootkits. A rootkit is a type of malware designed to gain administrative-level control over a computer system without being detected. Rootkits can change how the operating system functions and in some cases can tamper with the anti-virus program and render it ineffective. Rootkits are also difficult to remove, in some cases requiring a complete re-installation of the operating system. = Real-time protection = Real-time protection, on-access scanning, background guard, resident shield, autoprotect, and other synonyms refer to the automatic protection provided by most antivirus, anti- spyware, and other anti-malware programs. This monitors computer systems for suspicious activity such as computer viruses, spyware, adware, and other malicious objects in 'real-time', in other words while data loaded into the computer's active memory: when inserting a CD, opening an email, or browsing the web, or when a file already on the computer is opened or executed.Kaspersky Lab Technical Support Portal  Issues of concern  = Unexpected renewal costs = Some commercial antivirus software end-user license agreements include a clause that the subscription will be automatically renewed, and the purchaser's credit card automatically billed, at the renewal time without explicit approval. For example, McAfee requires users to unsubscribe at least 60 days before the expiration of the present subscription while BitDefender sends notifications to unsubscribe 30 days before the renewal. Norton AntiVirus also renews subscriptions automatically by default. = Rogue security applications = Some apparent antivirus programs are actually malware masquerading as legitimate software, such as WinFixer, MS Antivirus, and Mac Defender. = Problems caused by false positives = A \\"false positive\\" or \\"false alarm\\" is when antivirus software identifies a non-malicious file as malware. When this happens, it can cause serious problems. For example, if an antivirus program is configured to immediately delete or quarantine infected files, as is common on Microsoft Windows antivirus applications, a false positive in an essential file can render the Windows operating system or some applications unusable. Recovering from such damage to critical software infrastructure incurs technical support costs and businesses can be forced to close whilst remedial action is undertaken. Examples of serious false-positives: *May 2007: a faulty virus signature issued by Symantec mistakenly removed essential operating system files, leaving thousands of PCs unable to boot. *May 2007: the executable file required by Pegasus Mail on Windows was falsely detected by Norton AntiVirus as being a Trojan and it was automatically removed, preventing Pegasus Mail from running. Norton AntiVirus had falsely identified three releases of Pegasus Mail as malware, and would delete the Pegasus Mail installer file when that happened. In response to this Pegasus Mail stated: :: *April 2010: McAfee VirusScan detected svchost.exe, a normal Windows binary, as a virus on machines running Windows XP with Service Pack 3, causing a reboot loop and loss of all network access. *December 2010: a faulty update on the AVG anti- virus suite damaged 64-bit versions of Windows 7, rendering it unable to boot, due to an endless boot loop created. *October 2011: Microsoft Security Essentials (MSE) removed the Google Chrome web browser, rival to Microsoft's own Internet Explorer. MSE flagged Chrome as a Zbot banking trojan. *September 2012: Sophos' anti-virus suite identified various update-mechanisms, including its own, as malware. If it was configured to automatically delete detected files, Sophos Antivirus could render itself unable to update, required manual intervention to fix the problem. *September 2017: the Google Play Protect anti-virus started identifying Motorola's Moto G4 Bluetooth application as malware, causing Bluetooth functionality to become disabled. = System and interoperability related issues = Running (the real-time protection of) multiple antivirus programs concurrently can degrade performance and create conflicts. However, using a concept called multiscanning, several companies (including G Data Software and Microsoft) have created applications which can run multiple engines concurrently. It is sometimes necessary to temporarily disable virus protection when installing major updates such as Windows Service Packs or updating graphics card drivers. Active antivirus protection may partially or completely prevent the installation of a major update. Anti-virus software can cause problems during the installation of an operating system upgrade, e.g. when upgrading to a newer version of Windows \\"in place\\"‚Äîwithout erasing the previous version of Windows. Microsoft recommends that anti-virus software be disabled to avoid conflicts with the upgrade installation process. Mentioned within \\"Before you begin\\". Mentioned within \\"General troubleshooting\\". Active anti-virus software can also interfere with a firmware update process. The functionality of a few computer programs can be hampered by active anti-virus software. For example, TrueCrypt, a disk encryption program, states on its troubleshooting page that anti-virus programs can conflict with TrueCrypt and cause it to malfunction or operate very slowly. Anti-virus software can impair the performance and stability of games running in the Steam platform. Steam support page. Support issues also exist around antivirus application interoperability with common solutions like SSL VPN remote access and network access control products. These technology solutions often have policy assessment applications that require an up-to-date antivirus to be installed and running. If the antivirus application is not recognized by the policy assessment, whether because the antivirus application has been updated or because it is not part of the policy assessment library, the user will be unable to connect. =Effectiveness= Studies in December 2007 showed that the effectiveness of antivirus software had decreased in the previous year, particularly against unknown or zero day attacks. The computer magazine c't found that detection rates for these threats had dropped from 40‚Äì50% in 2006 to 20‚Äì30% in 2007. At that time, the only exception was the NOD32 antivirus, which managed a detection rate of 68%. According to the ZeuS tracker website the average detection rate for all variants of the well-known ZeuS trojan is as low as 40%. The problem is magnified by the changing intent of virus authors. Some years ago it was obvious when a virus infection was present. At the time, viruses were written by amateurs and exhibited destructive behavior or pop-ups. Modern viruses are often written by professionals, financed by criminal organizations. In 2008, Eva Chen, CEO of Trend Micro, stated that the anti-virus industry has over-hyped how effective its products are‚Äîand so has been misleading customers‚Äîfor years. Independent testing on all the major virus scanners consistently shows that none provides 100% virus detection. The best ones provided as high as 99.9% detection for simulated real-world situations, while the lowest provided 91.1% in tests conducted in August 2013. Many virus scanners produce false positive results as well, identifying benign files as malware. Although methods may differ, some notable independent quality testing agencies include AV-Comparatives, ICSA Labs, West Coast Labs, Virus Bulletin, AV-TEST and other members of the Anti-Malware Testing Standards Organization. =New viruses= Anti-virus programs are not always effective against new viruses, even those that use non-signature-based methods that should detect new viruses. The reason for this is that the virus designers test their new viruses on the major anti- virus applications to make sure that they are not detected before releasing them into the wild. Some new viruses, particularly ransomware, use polymorphic code to avoid detection by virus scanners. Jerome Segura, a security analyst with ParetoLogic, explained: A proof of concept virus has used the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) to avoid detection from anti-virus software. The potential success of this involves bypassing the CPU in order to make it much harder for security researchers to analyse the inner workings of such malware. = Rootkits = Detecting rootkits is a major challenge for anti-virus programs. Rootkits have full administrative access to the computer and are invisible to users and hidden from the list of running processes in the task manager. Rootkits can modify the inner workings of the operating system and tamper with antivirus programs. = Damaged files = If a file has been infected by a computer virus, anti-virus software will attempt to remove the virus code from the file during disinfection, but it is not always able to restore the file to its undamaged state. In such circumstances, damaged files can only be restored from existing backups or shadow copies (this is also true for ransomware); installed software that is damaged requires re-installation (however, see System File Checker). = Firmware infections = Any writeable firmware in the computer can be infected by malicious code. This is a major concern, as an infected BIOS could require the actual BIOS chip to be replaced to ensure the malicious code is completely removed. Anti-virus software is not effective at protecting firmware and the motherboard BIOS from infection. In 2014, security researchers discovered that USB devices contain writeable firmware which can be modified with malicious code (dubbed \\"BadUSB\\"), which anti-virus software cannot detect or prevent. The malicious code can run undetected on the computer and could even infect the operating system prior to it booting up.  Performance and other drawbacks  Antivirus software has some drawbacks, first of which that it can impact a computer's performance. Furthermore, inexperienced users can be lulled into a false sense of security when using the computer, considering their computers to be invulnerable, and may have problems understanding the prompts and decisions that antivirus software presents them with. An incorrect decision may lead to a security breach. If the antivirus software employs heuristic detection, it must be fine-tuned to minimize misidentifying harmless software as malicious (false positive). Antivirus software itself usually runs at the highly trusted kernel level of the operating system to allow it access to all the potential malicious process and files, creating a potential avenue of attack. The US National Security Agency (NSA) and the UK Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) intelligence agencies, respectively, have been exploiting anti-virus software to spy on users. Anti-virus software has highly privileged and trusted access to the underlying operating system, which makes it a much more appealing target for remote attacks. Additionally anti-virus software is \\"years behind security-conscious client-side applications like browsers or document readers. It means that Acrobat Reader, Microsoft Word or Google Chrome are harder to exploit than 90 percent of the anti-virus products out there\\", according to Joxean Koret, a researcher with Coseinc, a Singapore- based information security consultancy.  Alternative solutions  Clam AV 0.95.2 running a virus signature definition update, scanning a file, and identifying a Trojan. Antivirus software running on individual computers is the most common method employed of guarding against malware, but it is not the only solution. Other solutions can also be employed by users, including Unified Threat Management (UTM), hardware and network firewalls, Cloud-based antivirus and online scanners. = Hardware and network firewall = Network firewalls prevent unknown programs and processes from accessing the system. However, they are not antivirus systems and make no attempt to identify or remove anything. They may protect against infection from outside the protected computer or network, and limit the activity of any malicious software which is present by blocking incoming or outgoing requests on certain TCP/IP ports. A firewall is designed to deal with broader system threats that come from network connections into the system and is not an alternative to a virus protection system. = Cloud antivirus = Cloud antivirus is a technology that uses lightweight agent software on the protected computer, while offloading the majority of data analysis to the provider's infrastructure. One approach to implementing cloud antivirus involves scanning suspicious files using multiple antivirus engines. This approach was proposed by an early implementation of the cloud antivirus concept called CloudAV. CloudAV was designed to send programs or documents to a network cloud where multiple antivirus and behavioral detection programs are used simultaneously in order to improve detection rates. Parallel scanning of files using potentially incompatible antivirus scanners is achieved by spawning a virtual machine per detection engine and therefore eliminating any possible issues. CloudAV can also perform \\"retrospective detection,\\" whereby the cloud detection engine rescans all files in its file access history when a new threat is identified thus improving new threat detection speed. Finally, CloudAV is a solution for effective virus scanning on devices that lack the computing power to perform the scans themselves. Some examples of cloud anti-virus products are Panda Cloud Antivirus and Immunet. Comodo Group has also produced cloud-based anti- virus. = Online scanning = Some antivirus vendors maintain websites with free online scanning capability of the entire computer, critical areas only, local disks, folders or files. Periodic online scanning is a good idea for those that run antivirus applications on their computers because those applications are frequently slow to catch threats. One of the first things that malicious software does in an attack is disable any existing antivirus software and sometimes the only way to know of an attack is by turning to an online resource that is not installed on the infected computer. = Specialized tools = The command-line rkhunter scanner, an engine to scan for Linux rootkits running on Ubuntu. Virus removal tools are available to help remove stubborn infections or certain types of infection. Examples include Avast Free Anti- Malware, AVG Free Malware Removal Tools, and Avira AntiVir Removal Tool. It is also worth noting that sometimes antivirus software can produce a false positive result, indicating an infection where there is none. A rescue disk that is bootable, such as a CD or USB storage device, can be used to run antivirus software outside of the installed operating system, in order to remove infections while they are dormant. A bootable antivirus disk can be useful when, for example, the installed operating system is no longer bootable or has malware that is resisting all attempts to be removed by the installed antivirus software. Examples of some of these bootable disks include the Bitdefender Rescue CD, Kaspersky Rescue Disk 2018, and Windows Defender Offline (integrated into Windows 10 since the Anniversary Update). Most of the Rescue CD software can also be installed onto a USB storage device, that is bootable on newer computers.  Usage and risks  According to an FBI survey, major businesses lose $12 million annually dealing with virus incidents. A survey by Symantec in 2009 found that a third of small to medium-sized business did not use antivirus protection at that time, whereas more than 80% of home users had some kind of antivirus installed. According to a sociological survey conducted by G Data Software in 2010 49% of women did not use any antivirus program at all.Nearly 50% Women Don‚Äôt Use Anti-virus Software .

It spends the summer months breeding in Alaska, northern Canada, Siberia, and the northernmost reaches of Europe. During the winter, it migrates south to the coasts of North America, Europe, and Japan. Drake greater scaup are larger and have more rounded heads than the females; they have a bright blue bill and yellow eyes. Their heads are dark, with a green gloss; the breast is black, the belly white and the wing shows a white stripe. The females are mostly brown, again with white on the wing. They have dull blue bills and white on the face. Greater scaup nest near water, typically on islands in northern lakes or on floating mats of vegetation. They begin breeding at age two, but start building nests in the first year. The drakes have a complex courtship, which takes place on the return migration to the summer breeding grounds and concludes with the formation of monogamous pairs. Females lay a clutch of six to nine olive-buff-colored eggs. The eggs hatch in 24 to 28 days. The down-covered ducklings are able to follow their mother in her search for food immediately after hatching. Greater scaup eat aquatic molluscs, plants, and insects, which they obtain by diving underwater. They form large groups, called \\"rafts\\", that can number in the thousands. Their main threat is human development, although they are preyed upon by owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. Greater scaup populations have been declining since the 1980s; however, they are still listed as a species of least concern on the IUCN Red List. Taxonomy The greater scaup was formally described by Carl Linnaeus in 1761 under the binomial name Anas marila. The type locality is Lapland. The species is now placed in the genus Aythya that was introduced for the greater scaup by the German zoologist Friedrich Boie in 1822. The genus name Aythya is derived from the Ancient Greek aithuia which refers to a seabird mentioned by Aristotle and others and is thought to refer to a duck, auklet or other seabird. The species name marila is from the Greek word for charcoal embers or coal dust. Male greater scaup from America are distinguishable from those in Europe and Asia by the stronger vermiculations, worm-like carvings or marks on the mantle and scapulars, and are considered a separate subspecies, A. m. nearctica. Females of the two subspecies are indistinguishable. Based on size differences, a Pleistocene paleosubspecies, Aythya marila asphaltica, has also been described by Serebrovskij in 1941 from fossils recovered at Binagady, Azerbaijan. The greater scaup's name may come from \\"scalp\\", a Scottish and Northern English word for a shellfish bed, or from the duck's mating call: \\"scaup scaup\\". A phylogenetic analysis of the diving ducks, examining the skeletal anatomy and skin, found that the greater and lesser scaups are each other's closest relatives, with the tufted duck as the next closest relative of the pair. Description The adult greater scaup is long with a wingspan and a body mass of . It has a blue bill and yellow eyes and is 20% heavier and 10% longer than the closely related lesser scaup. The male has a dark head with a green sheen, a black breast, a light back, a black tail, and a white underside. The drake or male greater scaup is larger and has a more rounded head than the female. The drake's belly and flanks are a bright white. Its neck, breast, and tail feathers are a glossy black, while its lower flanks are vermiculated gray. The upper wing has a white stripe starting as the speculum and extending along the flight feathers to the wingtip. Legs and feet of both sexes are gray. The adult female has a brown body and head, with white wing markings similar to those of the male but slightly duller. It has a white band and brown oval shaped patches at the base of the bill, which is a slightly duller shade of blue than the drake's. Juvenile greater scaup look similar to adult females. The greater scaup drake's eclipse plumage looks similar to its breeding plumage, except the pale parts of the plumage are a buffy gray. Distinguishing greater from lesser scaups can be difficult in the field. The head of the greater tends to be more rounded, and the white wing stripe is more extensive. Distribution and habitat The greater scaup has a circumpolar distribution, breeding within the Arctic Circle both in the Old World (the Palearctic) and in North America (the Nearctic). It spends the summer months in Alaska, Siberia, and the northern parts of Europe. It is also found in Asia and is present in the Aleutian Islands year round. The summer habitat is marshy lowland tundra and islands in fresh water lakes. In the fall, greater scaup populations start their migration south for the winter. They winter along the Pacific and Atlantic coasts of North America, the coasts of northwest Europe, the Caspian Sea, the Black Sea, the coast of Japan, Yellow Sea and East China Sea. During the winter months, they are found in coastal bays, estuaries, and sometimes inland lakes, such as the lakes of Central Europe and the Great Lakes. In Europe, the greater scaup breeds in Iceland, the northern coasts of the Scandinavian peninsula, including much of the northern parts of the Baltic Sea, the higher mountains of Scandinavia and the areas close to the Arctic Sea in Russia. These birds spend the winters in the British Isles, western Norway, the southern tip of Sweden, the coast from Brittany to Poland, including all of Denmark, the Alps, the eastern Adriatic Sea, the northern and western Black sea and the southwestern Caspian Sea. In North America, the greater scaup summers in Newfoundland and Labrador, Ungava Bay, Hudson Bay, Lake Winnipeg, northern Yukon, northern Manitoba, and northern Saskatchewan. It winters along the coasts of North America from northern British Columbia south to the Baja Peninsula and from Nova Scotia and New Brunswick south to Florida, as well as the shores of the Great Lakes and the Gulf of Mexico. Behaviour =Breeding= Egg, Collection Museum Wiesbaden Greater scaup breed in the tundra and the boreal forest; it is estimated that 75% of the North American population breed in Alaska. They typically nest on islands in large northern lakes. Greater scaup begin breeding when they are two years old, although they may start nesting at age one. Drake greater scaup have a soft, quick whistle they use to attract the attention of hens during courtship, which takes place from late winter to early spring, on the way back to their northern breeding grounds. Female greater scaup have a single pitch, a raspy ‚Äúarrr-arrr-arrr-arrr-arrr‚Äù vocalization. The courtship is complex and results in the formation of monogamous pairs. Pairs nest in close proximity to each other in large colonies, usually near water, on an island or shoreline, or on a raft of floating vegetation. The nest consists of a shallow depression made by the female and lined with her down. After the female lays the eggs, the drake abandons the female and goes with other drakes to a large, isolated lake to molt. These lakes can be close to the breeding grounds or miles away. The lakes chosen are used yearly by the same ducks. The optimal molting lake is fairly shallow and has an abundance of food sources and cover. The female lays six to nine olive-buff-colored eggs, which she incubates for 24‚Äì28 days. A larger clutch could indicate brood parasitism by other greater scaups or even ducks of other species. Newly hatched chicks are covered with down and are soon able to walk, swim, and feed themselves; however, they are not able to fly until 40‚Äì45 days after hatching. The vulnerable small chicks follow their mother, who protects them from predators. =Feeding= Flock feeding in Tokyo bay, Japan The greater scaup dive to obtain food, which they eat on the surface. They mainly eat molluscs, aquatic plants, and aquatic insects. During the summer months, the greater scaup will eat small aquatic crustaceans. There is a report of four greater scaups in April near Chicago swallowing hibernating leopard frogs (with body length about ), which they dredged out of a roadside freshwater pond. In freshwater ecosystems, the greater scaup will eat seeds, leaves, stems and roots, along with sedges, pondweeds, muskgrass, and wild celery. Owing to the greater scaup's webbed feet and weight, it can dive up to and stay submerged for up to a minute, allowing it to reach food sources that are unobtainable to other diving ducks. The greater scaup forms large flocks, some of which can contain thousands of birds. When flocks are on flowing water, they will face the current, and as the ducks float backwards, some fly to the front of the flock to maintain position. Threats Video of greater scaup. Common predators of the greater scaup are owls, skunks, raccoons, foxes, coyotes, and humans. Greater scaup often find themselves entangled in fishing nets, thus large numbers of them drown in nets each year. Greater scaup can catch avian influenza, so future outbreaks have the potential to threaten greater scaup populations. Although the greater scaup faces numerous threats, the most significant challenge to their survival is habitat degradation caused by a mix of human development and runoff. Greater scaup, when moulting and during the winter, are threatened by escalated levels of organochloride contaminants. Oil and sewage pollution also threaten this duck. Since 80% of the greater scaup population winters in the urbanized part of the Atlantic Flyway, these ducks are subject to high levels of organic contaminates, along with increased levels of heavy metals in foods and habitat. A joint group of American and Canadian scientists researching scaup migration across the Great Lakes found that 100% of female greater scaup, and 77% of female lesser scaup, had escalated levels of selenium in their bodies. Selenium is an occurring semimetallic trace element that occurs naturally in some soils and minute amounts are necessary for animal life. However excessive selenium can cause reproductive harm and is highly toxic. On their migration across the Great Lakes, greater scaups are at risk of ingesting selenium by eating the invasive zebra mussels, which can render a hen infertile. This sterilization of hens is causing the population to decrease. In a study of 107 scaup, they all had traces of iron, zinc, manganese, copper, lead, cadmium, cobalt and nickel in their tissue samples with varying concentrations of metals in different types of tissues. Further analysis revealed that the kidneys had the highest levels of cadmium, the liver had the highest levels of copper and manganese, the liver and the stomach had the highest levels of zinc, and the lungs and liver had the highest levels of iron. There was no difference in concentration when comparing genders. Conservation leg ring in North Carolinaalt=Photograph Greater scaup are rated as a species of least concern by the IUCN Redlist. During aerial population surveys greater and lesser scaup are counted together, because they look almost identical from the air. It was estimated that the greater scaup made up about 11% of the continental scaup population. Since the 1980s, scaup populations have been steadily decreasing. Some of the primary factors contributing to this decline are habitat loss, contaminants, changes in breeding habitat, and a lower female survival rate. The 2010 American scaup population survey was 4.2 million scaup, however, the worldwide greater scaup population survey estimated 1,200,000 to 1,400,000 mature greater scaup. Along with the aerial population surveys, there is a banding program for the greater scaup. Metal leg bands are placed on them, so that if the scaup is killed by a hunter or if it is captured by another banding group, the number on the band can be reported to biologists and wildlife organizations. These banding programs yield valuable data about migration patterns, harvest rates, and survival rates. Greater scaup decoys, male on the left and female on the right. Each is attached to a lead weight. Human interactions Greater scaup are a popular game bird in North America and Europe. They are hunted in Denmark, Germany, Greece, France, the United Kingdom, and Ireland, and in Iran for both sport and commercial reasons. Greater scaup are hunted with shotguns because they must be shot on the fly, a challenging task, as they can fly at up to . Greater scaup are hunted from shorelines and in open water hunting blinds or layout boats, low-profile kayak-like boats that hunters lie inside. Hunters frequently use decoys to attract the birds, often arranged to simulate a raft of greater scaup and featuring an open area to attract the birds to land. In most countries where greater scaup are hunted, a duck stamp is required along with the normal hunting licences that are required to pursue other game. In America and Canada, waterfowl must be hunted with non-toxic shot.

A riddle is a statement, question or phrase having a double or veiled meaning, put forth as a puzzle to be solved. Riddles are of two types: enigmas, which are problems generally expressed in metaphorical or allegorical language that require ingenuity and careful thinking for their solution, and conundra, which are questions relying for their effects on punning in either the question or the answer. Archer Taylor says that \\"we can probably say that riddling is a universal art\\" and cites riddles from hundreds of different cultures including Finnish, Hungarian, American Indian, Chinese, Russian, Dutch and Filipino sources amongst many others.Archer Taylor, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951), p. 3. Many riddles and riddle-themes are internationally widespread. In the assessment of Elli K√∂ngas Maranda (originally writing about Malaitian riddles, but with an insight that has been taken up more widely), whereas myths serve to encode and establish social norms, \\"riddles make a point of playing with conceptual boundaries and crossing them for the intellectual pleasure of showing that things are not quite as stable as they seem\\" ‚Äì though the point of doing so may still ultimately be to \\"play with boundaries, but ultimately to affirm them\\".Elli K√∂ng√§s Maranda, \\"Riddles and Riddling: An Introduction\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 89 (1976), 127‚Äì37 (p. 131); ; ; cf. Hannah Burrows, \\"Wit and Wisdom: The Worldview of the Old Norse-Icelandic Riddles and their Relationship to Eddic Poetry\\", in Eddic, Skaldic, and Beyond: Poetic Variety in Medieval Iceland and Norway, ed. by Martin Chase (New York: Forham University Press, 2014), pp. 114‚Äì35 (p. 116). Definitions and research =Definitions= Defining riddles precisely is hard and has attracted a fair amount of scholarly debate. The first major modern attempt to define the riddle was by Robert Petsch in 1899,Petsch, Robert. \\"Neue Beitr√´ge zur Kenntnis des Volksr√§tsels\\", Palaestra, 4 (1899). with another seminal contribution, inspired by structuralism, by Robert A. Georges and Alan Dundes in 1963.Georges, Robert A.; Dundes, Alan. \\"Towards a Structural Definition of the Riddle\\", Journal of American Folklore, 76(300) (1963), 111‚Äì18 , . Reprinted in Alan Dundes, Analytic Essays in Folklore (The Hague: Mouton, 1975), pp. 95‚Äì102. Georges and Dundes suggested that \\"a riddle is a traditional verbal expression which contains one or more descriptive elements, a pair of which may be in opposition; the referent of the elements is to be guessed\\". There are many possible sub-sets of the riddle, including charades, droodles, and some jokes. In some traditions and contexts, riddles may overlap with proverbs.John C. Messenger, Jr. 1960. \\"Anang Proverb-Riddles\\". The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 73, No. 289: pp. 225‚Äì235. . .Finnegan, Ruth. Oral Literature in Africa.

The Russian phrase \\"Nothing hurts it, but it groans all the time\\" can be deployed as a proverb (when its referent is a hypochondriac) or as a riddle (when its referent is a pig).Alan Dundes, \\"On the Structure of the Proverb\\", in Analytic Essays in Folklore, ed. by Richard Dorson (The Hague: Mouton, 1975), pp. 103‚Äì8. =Research= Much academic research on riddles has focused on collecting, cataloguing, defining, and typologising riddles. Key work on cataloguing and typologising riddles was published by Antti Aarne in 1918‚Äì20,Antti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20). and by Archer Taylor.Archer Taylor, A Bibliography of Riddles, Folklore Fellows Communications, 126 (Helsinki, 1939). In the case of ancient riddles recorded without solutions, considerable scholarly energy also goes into proposing and debating solutions.E.g. Patrick J. Murphy, Unriddling the Exteter Riddles (University Park, PA: Pennsylvania State University Press, 2011). Whereas previously researchers had tended to take riddles out of their social performance contexts, the rise of anthropology in the post-War period encouraged more researchers to study the social role of riddles and riddling.E.g. David Evans, \\"Riddling and the Structure of Context\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 89 (1976), 166‚Äì88; ; ; Annikki Kaivola- Bregenh√∏j, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), . However, wide-ranging studies of riddles have tended to be limited to Western countries, with Oriental and African riddles being relatively neglected.A. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010), 14‚Äì18. Riddles have also attracted linguists, often studying riddles from the point of view of semiotics.Elli K√∂ng√§s Maranda, \\"Riddles and Riddling: An Introduction\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 89 (1976), 127‚Äì37 (pp. 135‚Äì37); ; .Claudia Schittek, Die Sprach- und Erkenntnisformen der R√§tsel (Stuttgart: M und P, Verlag f√ºr Wissenschaft und Forschung, 1991): ; . International riddles Faroese stamp depicting a traditional Faroese version of the year-riddle. Many riddles appear in similar form across many countries, and often continents. Borrowing of riddles happens on a small, local scale, and across great distances. Dorvlo gives an example of a riddle that has been borrowed from the Ewe language by speakers of the neighboring Logba language: \\"This woman has not been to the riverside for water, but there is water in her tank\\". The answer is a coconut.Dorvlo, Kofi. \\"Ewe borrowings into Logba.\\" International Journal of Bilingualism 18.4 (2014): 428-446. On a much wider scale, the Riddle of the Sphinx has also been documented in the Marshall Islands, possibly carried there by Western contacts in the last two centuries.p. 266. Davenport, William. 1952. Fourteen Marshallese Riddles. The Journal of American Folklore Vol. 65, No. 257, pp. 265-266. Key examples of internationally widespread riddles, with a focus on European tradition, follow, based on the classic study by Antti Aarne. = The Writing-riddle = The basic form of this riddle is 'White field, black seeds', where the field is a page and the seeds are letters.Antti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20), I 35‚Äì73. An example is the eighth- or ninth-century Veronese Riddle: Here, the oxen are the scribe's finger(s) and thumb, and the plough is the pen. Among literary riddles, riddles on the pen and other writing equipment are particularly widespread.Luke Powers, \\"Tests for True Wit: Jonathan Swift's Pen and Ink Riddles\\", South Central Review, 7.4 (Winter 1990), 40‚Äì52; . .Helen Price, Human and NonHuman in Anglo-Saxon and British Postwar Poetry: Reshaping Literary Ecology (unpublished doctoral thesis, University of Leeds, 2013), pp. 92‚Äì128. = The Year-riddle = This type is found across Eurasia.Antti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20), I 74‚Äì178. For example, a riddle in the Sanskrit Rig Veda describes a 'twelve-spoked wheel, upon which stand 720 sons of one birth' (i.e. the twelve months of the year, which together have 360 days and 360 nights).Frederick Tupper, Jr, \\"Originals and Analogues of the Exeter Book Riddles\\", Modern Language Notes, 18.4 (April 1903), 97‚Äì106 (p. 102). . = The Person-riddle = The most famous example of this type is the Riddle of the Sphinx. This Estonian example shows the pattern: The riddle describes a crawling baby, a standing person, and an old person with a walking stick. = Two-legs, three-legs, and four-legs = This type includes riddles along the lines of this German example: The conceit here is that Two-legs is a person, Three-legs is a three-legged stool, Four-legs is a dog, and One-leg is a ham hock. = The Cow-riddle = An example of this typeAntti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20), II 60‚Äì172. is given here in thirteenth-century Icelandic form: The cow has four teats, four legs, two horns, two back legs, and one tail. = The Rider- and-horse riddle = This is a French version of the type = The Featherless bird-riddle = This type is best known in Central Europe.Antti Aarne, Vergleichende R√§tselforschungen, 3 vols, Folklore Fellows Communications, 26‚Äì28 (Helsinki/Hamina: Suomalainen Tiedeakatemia, 1918‚Äì20), III 3‚Äì48.

More recently, riddles have been collected from oral tradition by scholars in many parts of the world. =Babylon= According to Archer Taylor, \\"the oldest recorded riddles are Babylonian school texts which show no literary polish\\". The answers to the riddles are not preserved; they include \\"my knees hasten, my feet do not rest, a shepherd without pity drives me to pasture\\" (a river? A rowboat?); \\"you went and took the enemy's property; the enemy came and took your property\\" (a weaving shuttle?); \\"who becomes pregnant without conceiving, who becomes fat without eating?\\" (a raincloud?). It is clear that we have here riddles from oral tradition that a teacher has put into a schoolbook.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 12‚Äì13, citing M.

M. Houben, \\"The Ritual Pragmatics of a Vedic Hymn: The 'Riddle Hymn' and the Pravargya Ritual\\", Journal of the American Oriental Society, 120 (2000), 499‚Äì536 (English translation pp. 533‚Äì36), . . These riddles overlap in significant part with a collection of forty-seven in the Atharvaveda; riddles also appear elsewhere in Vedic texts.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 13‚Äì17.See also J. Huizinga, Homo Ludens: Proeve eener bepaling van het spel-element der cultuur (Haarlem, 1940), pp. 154ff. Taylor cited the following example: '\\"Who moves in the air? Who makes a noise on seeing a thief? Who is the enemy of lotuses? Who is the climax of fury?\\" The answers to the first three questions, when combined in the manner of a charade, yield the answer to the fourth question. The first answer is bird (vi), the second dog (√ßva), the third sun (mitra), and the whole is Vi√ßvamitra, Rama's first teacher and counselor and a man noted for his outbursts of rage'.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 16‚Äì17, citing A. F√ºhrer, \\"Sanskrit-R√§thsel\\", Zeitschrift der Deutschen morgenl√§ndischen Gesellschaft, 39 (1885), 99‚Äì100. Accordingly, riddles are treated in early studies of Sanskrit poetry such as Da·πá·∏çin's seventh- or eighth-century KƒÅvyƒÅdar≈õa. citing Durga Bhagwat, The Riddle in Indian Life, Lore and Literature (Bombay, 1965), 5-9. Early narrative literature also sometimes includes riddles, prominently the Mahabharata, which for example contains the Yaksha Prashna, a series of riddles posed by a nature-spirit (yaksha) to Yudhishthira.Annikki Kaivola-Bregenh√∏j, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 11‚Äì12; . The first riddle collection in a medieval Indic language is traditionally thought to be the riddles of Amir Khusrow (1253‚Äì1325), which are written in Hindawi, in verse, in the mƒÅtrika metre.Annemarie Schimmel, Classical Urdu Literature from the Beginning to IqbƒÅl, A History of Indian Literature, 8 (Harrassowitz: Wiesbaden, 1975), p. 129. As of the 1970s, folklorists had not undertaken extensive collecting of riddles in India, but riddling was known to be thriving as a form of folk-literature, sometimes in verse.Alan Dundes and Ved Prakash Vatuk, 'Some Characteristic Meters of Hindi Riddle Prosody', Asian Folklore Studies, 33.1 (1974), 85-153. Riddles have also been collected in Tamil. =Hebrew, Arabic and Persian= While riddles are not numerous in the Bible, they are present, most famously in Samson's riddle in Judges xiv.14, but also in I Kings 10:1‚Äì13 (where the Queen of Sheba tests Solomon's wisdom), and in the Talmud.Joseph Jacobs, \\"Riddle\\", in The Jewish Encyclopedia: A Descriptive Record of the History, Religion, Literature, and Customs of the Jewish People from the Earliest Times to the Present Day, ed. by Isidore Singer (New York: Funk & Wagnalls, 1901‚Äì1907), s.v. Sirach also mentions riddles as a popular dinner pastime, while the Aramaic Story of Ahikar contains a long section of proverbial wisdom that in some versions also contains riddles.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 41‚Äì42. Otherwise, riddles are sparse in ancient Semitic writing. In the medieval period, however, verse riddles, alongside other puzzles and conundra, became a significant literary form in the Arabic-speaking world,G. J. H. van Gelder, \\"lughz\\", in Encyclopedia of Arabic Literature, ed. by Julie Scott Meisami and Paul Starkey, 2 vols (London: Routledge, 1998), II 479. and accordingly in Islamic Persian cultureA. A. Seyed-Gohrab, Courtly Riddles: Enigmatic Embellishments in Early Persian Poetry (Leiden: Leiden University Press, 2010). and in Hebrew ‚Äî particularly in Al-Andalus.See further Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 35‚Äì37. Since early Arabic and Persian poetry often features rich, metaphorical description, and ekphrasis, there is a natural overlap in style and approach between poetry generally and riddles specifically; literary riddles are therefore often a subset of the descriptive poetic form known in both traditions as wasf. Riddles are attested in anthologies of poetry and in prosimetrical portrayals of riddle-contests in Arabic maqƒÅmƒÅt and in Persian epics such as the Shahnameh. Meanwhile, in Hebrew, Dunash ben Labrat (920‚Äì990), credited with transposing Arabic metres into Hebrew, composed a number of riddles, mostly apparently inspired by folk-riddles.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 1948), pp. 33‚Äì35, citing Nehemya Aluny, \\"Ten Dunash Ben Labrat's Riddles\\", The Jewish Quarterly Review, New Series, 36 (1945), 141‚Äì46, , . Other Hebrew- writing exponents included Moses ibn Ezra, Yehuda Alharizi, Judah Halevi, Immanuel the Roman and Israel Onceneyra. In both Arabic and Persian, riddles seem to have become increasingly scholarly in style over time, increasingly emphasising riddles and puzzles in which the interpreter has resolve clues to letters and numbers to put together the word which is the riddle's solution. Riddles have been collected by modern scholars throughout the Arabic-speaking world.E.g. Charles T. Scott, Persian and Arabic Riddles: A Language-Centered Approach to Genre Definition (Bloomington, 1965). = Europe =  Greek  Riddles are known to have been popular in Greece in Hellenistic times, and possibly before; they were prominent among the entertainments and challenges presented at symposia.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, Gods Cannot Tell Lies': Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121‚Äì47 (p. 140). Oracles were also represented as speaking in often riddlic language.Frederick G. Naerebout and Kim Beerden, Gods Cannot Tell Lies': Riddling and Ancient Greek Divination\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 121‚Äì47. However, the first significant corpus of Greek riddles survives in an anthology of earlier material known as the Greek Anthology, which contains about 50 verse riddles,Christine Luz, \\"What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83‚Äì99. probably put into its present form by Constantine Cephalas, working in the tenth century CE.Jan Kwapisz, \\"Were there Hellenistic Riddle Books?\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 148‚Äì67 (p. 148). Most surviving ancient Greek riddles are in verse.Christine Luz, \\"What has it got in its Pocketses? Or, What Makes a Riddle a Riddle?\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 83‚Äì99 (p. 84). In the second chapter of Book III of Aristotle's Rhetoric, the philosopher stated that \\"good riddles do, in general, provide us with satisfactory metaphors: for metaphors imply riddles, and therefore a good riddle can furnish a good metaphor.\\" Literary riddles were also composed in Byzantium, from perhaps the tenth century with the work of John Geometres, into the fifteenth century, along with a neo- Byzantine revival in around the early eighteenth century. There was a particular peak around the long twelfth century.  Latin and romance  Two Latin riddles are preserved as graffiti in the Basilica at Pompeii.Rebcca R. Benefiel, \\"Magic Squares, Alphabet Jumbles, Riddles and More: The Culture of Word-Games among the Graffiti of Pompeii\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 65‚Äì79 (pp. 72‚Äì75). The pre- eminent collection of ancient Latin riddles is a collection of 100 hexametrical riddles by Symphosius which were influential on later medieval Latin writers. The Bern Riddles, a collection of Latin riddles clearly modelled on Symphosius, were composed in the early seventh century by an unknown author, perhaps in northern Italy. Symphosius's collection also inspired a number of Anglo-Saxon riddlers who wrote in Latin.Andrew Welsh, \\"Riddle\\" in Medieval Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs, ed. by Carl Lindahl, John McNamara and John Lindow, 2 vols (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000), II 824‚Äì32 (pp. 826‚Äì27). They remained influential in medieval Castilian tradition, being the basis for the second set of riddles in the thirteenth-century Libro de Apolonio, posed by Apolonio's daughter Tarsiana to her father.Doris Clark, \\"Tarsiana's Riddles in the LdA\\", in Medieval Hispanic Studies Presented to Rita Hamilton, ed. by Alan D. Deyermond (T√°mesis, 1976), pp. 31‚Äì43, cited by Harriet Goldberg, \\"Riddles and Enigmas in Medieval Castilian Literature\\", Romance Philology, 36(2) (1982), 209‚Äì21 (p. 216 n. 22). The perhaps eighth- or ninth-century Veronese Riddle is a key witness to the linguistic transition from Latin to Romance, but riddles are otherwise rare in medieval romance languages. However, in the early modern period, printed riddle collections were published in French, including the Adevineaux amoureux (printed in Bruges by Colard Mansion around 1479); and Demandes joyeuses en maniere de quolibets, the basis for Wynkyn de Worde's 1511 Demaundes Joyous.Andrew Welsh, \\"Riddle\\" in Medieval Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs, ed. by Carl Lindahl, John McNamara and John Lindow, 2 vols (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000), II 824-32 (p. 830).  The Germanic-speaking world  The Exeter Book: the principal manuscript of medieval Germanic-language riddles.Riddles survive only fragmentarily in Old High German: three, very short, possible examples exist in manuscripts from the Monastery of St Gallen, but, while certainly cryptic,Tomas Tomasek, Das deutsche R√§tsel im Mittelalter, Hermaea germanistische Forschungen, neue Folge, 69 (T√ºbingen: Niemeyer, 1994), pp. 158‚Äì74. they are not necessarily riddles in a strict sense.Christopher Wells, \\"The Shorter German Verse Texts\\", in German Literature of the Early Middle Ages, ed. by Brian Murdoch, Camden House History of German Literature, 2 (Rochester, NY: Camden House, 2004), pp. 157‚Äì200 (pp. 181‚Äì82). About 150 survive in Middle High German, mostly quoted in other literary contexts.Jeffrey Scott Love, The Reception of Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks from the Middle Ages to the Seventeenth Century, M√ºnchner Nordistische Studien, 14 (M√ºnchen: Herbert Utz Verlag, 2013), p. 198.Tomas Tomasek, Das deutsche R√§tsel im Mittelalter, Hermea: Germanistische Forschungen, Neue Folge, 69 (T√ºbingen: Niemeyer, 1994).On German riddles, see further Mathilde Hain, R√§tsel, Sammlung Metzler, 53. Realienb√ºcher f√ºr Germanisten. Abt. E: Poetik (Stuttgart: Metzler, 1966). Likewise, riddles are rare in Old Norse: almost all occur in one section of Hervarar saga ok Hei√∞reks, in which the god √ì√∞inn propounds around 37 riddles (depending on the manuscript).Alaric Hall, \\"Changing Style and Changing Meaning: Icelandic Historiography and the Medieval Redactions of Hei√∞reks saga\\", Scandinavian Studies, 77 (2005), 1‚Äì30, at pp. 9‚Äì10. These riddles do, however, provide insights into Norse mythology, medieval Scandinavian social norms, and rarely attested poetic forms.Burrows, Hannah, \\"Wit and Wisdom: The Worldview of the Old Norse-Icelandic Riddles and their Relationship to Eddic Poetry\\", in Eddic, Skaldic, and Beyond: Poetic Variety in Medieval Iceland and Norway, ed. by Martin Chase (New York: Forham University Press, 2014), 114‚Äì35; Hannah Burrows, \\"Enigma Variations: Hervarar sagas Wave-Riddles and Supernatural Women in Old Norse Poetic Tradition\\", JEGP: Journal of English and Germanic Philology, 112 (2013), 194‚Äì216, , . By contrast, verse riddles were prominent among Anglo-Saxons, made a prominent literary form by the Anglo-Saxon Aldhelm (c. 639‚Äì709), writing in Latin and inspired by the fourth- or fifth-century Latin poet Symphosius. He was followed by a number of other Anglo-Saxons writing riddles in Latin. This prestigious literary heritage contextualises the survival of nearly one hundred riddles in the tenth-century Exeter Book, one of the main surviving collections of Old English verse. The riddles in this book vary in subject matter from ribald innuendo to theological sophistication. Three, Exeter Book Riddle 35 and Riddles 40/66, are in origin translations of riddles by Aldhelm (and Riddle 35 the only Old English riddle to be attested in another manuscript besides the Exeter Book). Unlike the pithy three-line riddles of Symphosius, the Old English riddles tend to be discursive, often musing on complex processes of manufacture when describing artefacts such as mead (Exeter Book Riddle 27) or a reed-pen or -pipe (Exeter Book Riddle 60). They are noted for providing perspectives on the world which give voice to actors which tend not to appear in Old English poetry, ranging from female slaves to animals and plants, and they often subvert the conventions of Old English heroic and religious poetry. While medieval records of Germanic-language riddles are patchy, with the advent of print in the West, collections of riddles and similar kinds of questions began to be published. A large number of riddle collections were printed in the German-speaking world and, partly under German influence, in Scandinavia.Frauke Rademann-Veith, Die skandinavischen R√§tselb√ºcher auf der Grundlage der deutschen R√§tselbuch- Traditionen (1540‚Äì1805) (Frankfurt am Main: Lang, 2010) (PhD thesis, M√ºnster University, 2004). Riddles were evidently hugely popular in Germany: a recent research project uncovered more than 100,000 early modern German riddles, with the most important collection being that Strassburger R√§tselbuch, first published around 1500 and many times reprinted.Strassburger R√§thselbuch: Die erste zu Strassburg ums Jahr 1505 gedruckte deutsche R√§thselsammlung, ed. by A. F. Butsch (Stra√üburg, 1876). This is one of the most famous riddles of that time: That is, \\"the snow (featherless bird) lies on a bare tree in winter (leafless tree), and the sun (speechless maiden) causes the snow to melt (ate the featherless bird)\\".Dominik Landwehr, \\"Review of Simpliciana: Schriften der Grimmelshausen Gesellschaft 2014\\", in Cryptologia, 41(1) (2017), 92‚Äì96. . Likewise, early modern English-speakers published printed riddle collections, such as the 1598 Riddles of Heraclitus and Democritus, which includes for example the following riddle: First I was small, and round like a pearl; Then long and slender, as brave as an earl; Since, like an hermit, I lived in a cell, And now, like a rogue, in the wide world I dwell.Archer Taylor, The Literary Riddle before 1600 (Berkeley: University of California Pres, 1948), p. 2. After the early Middle Ages, the riddle was seldom used as a literary form in English. Tellingly, while Jonathan Swift composed at least eight verse riddles on these such as a pen, gold, and the privy, this was seen as a lapse in taste by many of his contemporaries.Gregg A. Hecimovich, Puzzling the Reader: Riddles in Nineteenth-century British Literature (New York: Peter Lang, 2008). However, although riddles are seldom used today as a literary form in their own right, they have arguably influenced the approach to poetry of a number of twentieth-century poets, such as Francis Ponge, Wallace Stevens, Richard Wilbur, Rainer M. Rilke, and Henrikas Radauskas.≈Ωivilƒó Gimbutas, The Riddle in the Poem (Dallas: University Press of America, 2004). The famed Transcendentalist Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote \\"All is a riddle, and the key to a riddle...is another riddle\\". Riddles continued to flourish until recently as an oral form of entertainment, however; the seminal collection of Anglophone riddles from the early modern period through to the twentieth century is Archer Taylor's.Taylor, Archer, English Riddles from Oral Tradition (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1951). Riddles are, for example, prominent in some early-modern ballads collected from oral tradition. Some of those included in the Child Ballads are \\"Riddles Wisely Expounded\\" (Child 1), \\"The Elfin Knight\\" (Child 2), \\"King John and the Bishop\\" (Child 45), \\"Captain Wedderburn's Courtship\\" (Child 46), and \\"Proud Lady Margaret\\" (Child 47).Andrew Welsh, \\"Riddle\\" in Medieval Folklore: An Encyclopedia of Myths, Legends, Tales, Beliefs, and Customs, ed. by Carl Lindahl, John McNamara and John Lindow, 2 vols (Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2000), II 824-32 (p. 829). Contemporary English-language riddles typically use puns and double entendres for humorous effect, rather than to puzzle the butt of the joke, as in \\"Why is six afraid of seven?\\" \\"Because seven eight nine (eight can be replaced with ate).\\" These riddles are now mostly children's humour and games rather than literary compositions. Some riddles are composed of foreign words and play on similar sounds, as in: :There were two cats, 1 2 3 cat and un deux trois cat, they had a swimming race from England to France. Who won? ::1 2 3 Cat because Un deux trois quatre cinq (un deux trois cat sank) This plays on the fact that the French words for four and five are pronounced similarly to the English words \\"Cat\\" and \\"Sank\\", hence the pun being the cat sank while also counting to five in French. The Celtic-speaking world Few riddles are attested in medieval Celtic languages, though this depends on how narrowly a riddle is defined; some early medieval Welsh and Irish juridical texts have been read as being riddles.Robin Chapman Stacey, 'Instructional Riddles in Welsh Law', in Heroic Poets and Poetic Heroes in Celtic Tradition: A Festschrift for Patrick K. Ford, ed. by Josoph Falaky Nagy and Leslie Ellen Jones (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2005), pp. 336-43; Robin Chapman Stacey, 'Speaking in Riddles', in Ireland and Europe in the Early Middle Ages: Texts and Transmission, ed. by Pr√≥ins√©as N√≠ Chath√°in (Dublin: Four Courts Press, 2002), pp. 243-48; Fergus Kelly, 'An Old-Irish Text on Court Procedure', Peritia, 5 (1986), 74-106. One undisputed riddle is attested in medieval Welsh, an elaborate text entitled 'Canu y Gwynt' ('song of the wind') in the fourteenth-century Book of Taliesin probably inspired by Latin riddles on the same theme. However, this record is supplemented by Latin material, apparently from a Brittonic cultural background in North Britain, about Lailoken: in a twelfth-century text, Lailoken poses three riddles to his captor King Meldred.Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), p. 35. The earliest riddles attested in Irish are generally held to be found in a short collection from the fifteenth-century Book of Fermoy.Patrick Sims- Williams, Irish Influence on Medieval Welsh Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), pp. 114‚Äì15. However, other forms of wisdom contest do occur in Irish literature, such as The Colloquy of the Two Sages, first attested in twelfth-century manuscripts, and in one such contest, in Imthecht na Tromdaime, first attested in the fifteenth century, at least one riddle is arguably posed.Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 36‚Äì37. Even research on the post-medieval Celtic-speaking world has yielded a \\"comparatively meagre corpus\\".Patrick Sims-Williams, Irish Influence on Medieval Welsh Literature (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2010), p. 115. Cf. Vernam Hull and Archer Taylor, A Collection of Welsh Riddles, University of California Publications in Modern Philology, 26 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1942); Vernam Hull and Archer Taylor, A Collection of Irish Riddles, University of California Publications: Folklore Studies, 6 (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1955; Thomas Parry, Y Gorcheston, Bulletin of the Board of Celtic Studies, 5 (1930), 138‚Äì40. The Finnic-speaking world The corpus of traditional riddles from the Finnic-speaking world (including the modern Finland, Estonia, and parts of Western Russia) is fairly unitary, though eastern Finnish-speaking regions show particular influence of Russian Orthodox Christianity and Slavonic riddle culture. The Finnish for \\"riddle\\" is arvoitus (pl. arvoitukset), related to the verb arvata (\\"guess\\"). Finnic riddles are noteworthy in relation to the rest of the world's oral riddle canon for its original imagery, their abundance of sexual riddles, and the interesting collision of influences from east and west;Leea Virtanen, \\"The Collecting and Study of Riddles in Finland\\", in Arvoitukset: Finnish Riddles, ed. by Leea Virtanen, Annikki Kaivola-Bregenh√∏j and Aarre Nyman, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, Toimituksia, 329 ([Helsinki]: Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 1977), pp. 51‚Äì57. along with the attestation in some regions of an elaborate riddle-game.Leea Virtanen, \\"On the Function of Riddles\\", in Arvoitukset: Finnish Riddles, ed. by Leea Virtanen, Annikki Kaivola-Bregenh√∏j and Aarre Nyman, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, Toimituksia, 329 ([Helsinki]: Suomen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 1977), pp. 77‚Äì89 (at 80‚Äì82). Riddles provide some of the first surviving evidence for Finnish-language literature.Finnish Folk Poetry: Epic. An Anthology in Finnish and English, ed. and trans. by Matti Kuusi, Keith Bosley and Michael Branch, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seuran toimituksia, 329 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 1977), pp. 33‚Äì34. =East Asia= China In modern Chinese, the standard word for 'riddle' is mi (Ë¨é, literally \\"to bewilder\\"). Riddles are spoken of as having a mian (Èù¢, \\"surface\\", the question component of the riddle), and a di (Â∫ï, \\"base\\", the answer component). Ancient Chinese terms for 'riddle' include yin (ËÆî) and sou (Âªã), which both mean \\"hidden\\".Timothy Wai Keung Chan, 'A New Reading of an Early Medieval Riddle', T‚Äôoung Pao, 99 (2013), 53‚Äì87 . Literary riddles in China first begin to be attested in significant numbers around the second century CE.Richard C. Rudolph, \\"Notes on the Riddle in China\\", California Folklore Quarterly, 1.1 (Jan. 1942), pp. 65‚Äì82 (pp. 79‚Äì81). . The Chinese riddle-tradition makes much use of visual puns on Chinese characters.Andrew H. Plaks, 'Riddle and Enigma in Chinese Civilization', in Untying the Knot: On Riddles and Other Enigmatic Modes, ed. by Galit Hasan-Rokem and David Shulman (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1996), pp. 225‚Äì36. One example is the riddle \\"ÂçÉ Èáå ‰ºö ÂçÉ Èáë\\"; these characters respectively mean 'thousand kilometre meet thousand gold'. #The first stage of solving the riddle is verbal: ##In Chinese culture, \\"it is said that a good horse can run thousands of kilometers per day\\", so \\"ÂçÉ Èáå\\" (thousand kilometer) is resolved as \\"È©¨\\" (horse). ##Meanwhile, because \\"a daughter is very important in the family\\", in Chinese culture it is possible to resolve \\"ÂçÉ Èáë\\" (thousand gold) as \\"Â•≥\\" (daughter). #The second stage of solving the riddle is visual: combining the radical \\"È©¨\\" (horse) with the radical \\"Â•≥\\" (daughter) produces the character \\"Â¶à\\" (mother). Thus the answer to \\"thousand kilometres meet thousand gold\\" is \\"Â¶à\\" (mother).Chuanqi Tan, Furu Wei, Li Dong, Weifeng Lv, and Ming Zhou, \\"Solving and Generating Chinese Character Riddles\\", Proceedings of the 2016 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, Austin, Texas, November 1‚Äì5, 2016 (Association for Computational Linguistics, 2016), pp. 846‚Äì55. The posing and solving of riddles has long been an important part of the Chinese Lantern Festival.Richard C. Rudolph, \\"Notes on the Riddle in China\\", California Folklore Quarterly, 1.1 (Jan. 1942), pp. 65‚Äì82 (p. 77). . China also contributed a distinctive kind of riddle known in English as the k≈çan (), developed as a teaching technique in Zen Buddhism in the Tang dynasty (618‚Äì907). In this tradition, the answer to the riddle is to be established through years of meditation, informed by Zen thought, as part of a process of seeking enlightenment.Charles G. Zug III, 'The Nonrational Riddle: The Zen Koan', The Journal of American Folklore, 80, no. 315 (January‚ÄìMarch 1967), 81-88 . In the twentieth century, thousands of riddles and similar enigmas have been collected, capitalising on the large number of homophones in Chinese. Examples of folk-riddles include: * There is a small vessel filled with sauce, one vessel holding two different kinds. (Egg) * Washing makes it more and more dirty; it is cleaner without washing. (Water) * When you use it you throw it away, and when you do not use it you bring it back. (Anchor)Richard C. Rudolph, \\"Notes on the Riddle in China\\", California Folklore Quarterly, 1.1 (Jan. 1942), pp. 65‚Äì82 (quoting pp. 74‚Äì75). . The Philippines Quite similar to its English counterpart, the riddle in the Philippines is called Bugtong.Hart, Donn V. 1964. Riddles in Philippine Folklore: An Anthropological Analysis. Syracuse, NY: Syracuse University Press. It is traditionally used during a funeral wake together with other games such as tong-its or the more popular sakla, later generations use Bugtong as a form of past time or as an activity. One peculiarity of the Filipino version is the way they start with the phrase Bugtong-bugtong before saying the riddle, usually it is common to create riddles that rhyme. This is an example of a Tagalog Bugtong: Further south, in Sulawesi, Indonesia, among the Pendau, riddles are also used at funeral gatherings. =Africa= Anthropological research in Africa has produced extensive collections of riddles over the last century or so.Elli K√∂ng√§s Maranda, \\"Riddles and Riddling: An Introduction\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 89 (1976), 127‚Äì37 (p. 128); ; . Riddles have been characterised as \\"one of the most important forms of oral art in Africa\\";Lyndon Harries, \\"The Riddle in Africa\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 84 (1971), 377‚Äì93; ; . Hamnett analyzes African riddling from an anthropological viewpoint;Hamnett, Ian, \\"Ambiguity, Classification and Change: the Function of Riddles\\", Man, 2 (1967), pp. 379‚Äì391. . Yoruba riddles have enjoyed a recent monograph study.Ak√≠nt√∫nd√© Ak√≠ny·∫πm√≠, Orature and Yor√πb√° Riddles (Palgrave Macmillan US, 2015), Print =The Americas= Native American traditions Riddles in the Americas are of particular interest to scholarship because it was long thought that native American cultures had no autochthonous riddle traditions (as opposed to riddles inspired by European culture, as with the twenty-two Aztec riddles collected by Bernardino de Sahag√∫n in the sixteenth century).Archer Taylor, \\"American Indian Riddles\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 57 (no. 223) (January‚ÄìMarch, 1944), 1‚Äì15 (pp. 1‚Äì2). .Cf. Wolfgang Mieder, \\"Proverbs of the Native Americans; A Prize Competition\\", Western Folklore, 48.3 (July 1989), 256‚Äì60. . If so, this would have suggested that riddles are not a universal art form.Annikki Kaivola-Bregenh√∏j, Riddles: Perspectives on the Use, Function, and Change in a Folklore Genre, Studia Fennica, Folkloristica, 10 (Helsinki: Finnish Literature Society, 2001), pp. 35‚Äì36; . However, Hieronymus Lalemant gave a fairly detailed account of a riddle-contest among the Huron around 1639 as part of a healing ritual.Archer Taylor, \\"American Indian Riddles\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 57 (no. 223) (January‚ÄìMarch, 1944), 1‚Äì15 (pp. 2‚Äì3). . > Someone will say, \\"What I desire and what I am seeking is that which bears a > lake within itself;\\" and by this is intended a pumpkin or calabash. Another > will say, \\"What I ask for is seen in my eyes‚Äîit will be marked with various > colors\\"; and because the same Huron word that signifies \\"eye\\" also signifies > \\"glass bead\\", this is a clue to divine what he desires‚Äînamely, some kind of > beads of this material, and of different colors. Accordingly, during the twentieth century, progressively more substantial collections of Native American riddles were made, including from the Alaskan Athabaskans (Ten'a) people in British Columbia;J. Jett√©, \\"Riddles of the Ten'a Indians\\", Anthropos, 8 (1913), 181‚Äì201, 630‚Äì51. .Archer Taylor, \\"American Indian Riddles\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 57 (no. 223) (January‚ÄìMarch, 1944), 1‚Äì15. . Amuzgo people in Central America;Charles T. Scott, \\"New Evidence of American Indian Riddles\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 76 (no. 301) (July‚ÄìSeptember 1963), 236‚Äì41. . and Quechua people in South America.Isbell, Billie Jean; Roncalla Fernandez, Fredy Amilcar, \\"The Ontogenesis of Metaphor: Riddle Games among Quechua Speakers Seen as Cognitive Discovery Procedures\\", Journal of Latin American Lore, 3:1 (1977), 19‚Äì49. . Thus, while data remains rather thin, it seems clear that riddling did exist in the Americas independently of European culture. Colonial traditions Riddles are found extensively in the settler-colonial cultures of the Americas. One form of riddle features in payada de contrapunto (\\"counterpoint payada\\"), a Rioplatense musical genre in which guitar players compete in a symbolic duel.R.Fern√°ndez Manzano y otros: El trovo de la Alpujarra. Ed. Centro de Documentaci√≥n Musical de Andaluc√≠a, 1992, p√°g. 27 Two guitar players challenge each other in song by asking a riddle-like question and/or answering the opponent's questions. This is performed through several successive rounds of witty exchanges which may include banter and even insults‚Äîtypically with a humorous intent. The most famous literary example of counterpoint payada comes from Mart√≠n Fierro, Part 2, Song 30, verses 6233‚Äì6838.Ghiano, Juan Carlos (1974). \\"El Contrapunto de Fierro y el Moreno\\". Revista Iberoamericana, XL:87-88, (1974): 337-352. Riddle-contests The Riddle Game is a formalized guessing game, a contest of wit and skill in which players take turns asking riddles. The player that cannot answer loses. Riddle games occur frequently in mythology and folklore as well as in popular literature. It is important to understand that in many cultures or contexts, people are not actually expected to guess the answers to riddles: they may be told by the riddler, or learn riddles and their answers together as they grow up.Lyndon Harries, \\"The Riddle in Africa\\", The Journal of American Folklore, 84 (1971), 377‚Äì93 (pp. 387‚Äì88); ; . Thus riddle-contests are not the only or even necessarily the main forum for the expression of riddles. The unsolvable riddle with which literary characters often win a riddle-contest is sometimes referred to as neck-riddle. =In real life= It seems that in ancient Greece, riddle-competitions were popular as an intellectual entertainment at symposia. A key source for this culture is Athenaeus.Erin Sebo, \\"In scirpo nodum: Symphosius' Reworking of the Riddle Form\\", in The Muse at Play: Riddles and Wordplay in Greek and Latin Poetry, ed. by Jan Kwapzt, David Petrain, and Mikolaj Szymanski, Beitr√§ge zur Altertumskunde (Berlin: de Gruyter, 2013), pp. 184‚Äì95 (p. 184). Elaborate and unusual riddle-games took place in the culture of eighteenth- and nineteenth- century Finnish-language riddles. For example, Elias L√∂nnrot observed customary riddle-contests in nineteenth-century Finland: > It took place without teams, but was a kind of a contest: a member of the > group would be sent out of the room, the others agreed on the riddle to be > posed; for three failures to divine the answer, the riddlee would have to > drop out of the game, to step aside, and to \\"buy\\" with a token the right to > participate again. =In ancient, medieval, and folk literature= In older texts, riddle- contests frequently provide the frame stories whereby riddles have been preserved for posterity. Such contests are a subset of wisdom contests more generally. They tend to fall into two groups: testing the wisdom of a king or other aristocrat; and testing the suitability of a suitor. Correspondingly, the Aarne‚ÄìThompson classification systems catalogue two main folktale-types including riddle-contests: AT 927, Outriddling the Judge, and AT 851, The Princess Who Can Not Solve the Riddle.Christine Goldberg, Turandot's Sisters: A Study of the Folktale AT 851, Garland Folklore Library, 7 (New York: Garland, 1993), pp. 10‚Äì11. =In modern literature= * In J. R. R. Tolkien's novel The Hobbit, Gollum challenges Bilbo Baggins to a riddle competition for his life. Bilbo breaks \\"the ancient rules\\" of the game but is able to escape with Gollum's magic ring. Rather like in the Old Norse Hei√∞reks saga, although Bilbo asked more of a simple question than a riddle, by attempting to answer it rather than challenging it Gollum accepted it as a riddle; by accepting it, his loss was binding.Adam Roberts, The Riddles of the Hobbit (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2013). * In The Grey King, the third book of Susan Cooper's fantasy sequence The Dark is Rising, Will and Bran must win a riddle game in order for Bran to claim his heritage as the Pendragon. * In Patricia A. McKillip's The Riddle-Master trilogy, the ancient art of riddlery is taught at the College of Caithnard ‚Äì the study based on books recovered from the ruins of the School of Wizards. The riddles in the series are composed of three parts ‚Äì the question, the answer, and the stricture ‚Äì and are both a way of recording history and a guide to living life. Riddles play a crucial role in the series, the main protagonist, Morgon of Hed, beginning his journey by winning the crown of the kings of Aum in a Riddle Game with the ancient ghost of Peven of Aum; Peven had a standing wager going that no one could win a riddle-game with him, and those who lost against him forfeited their lives. \\"Beware the unanswered riddle.\\" * In Stephen King's The Dark Tower III: The Waste Lands and The Dark Tower IV: Wizard and Glass, the ka-tet must riddle against Blaine the Mono in order to save their lives. At first Blaine can answer all riddles posed to him by the ka-tet easily, but then Eddie Dean, one of the ka-tet, gains the upper hand when he starts to ask joke riddles, effectively frustrating Blaine's highly logical mind. * In the Batman comic books, one of the hero's best known enemies is The Riddler who is personally compelled to supply clues about his upcoming crimes to his enemies in the form of riddles and puzzles. Stereotypically, they are these kinds of simple children's riddles, but modern treatments generally prefer to have the character use more sophisticated puzzles.

He is remembered as a leading public opponent of fascism, Stalinism, and Mafia infiltration of the trade union movement. Born, raised, and educated in Italy, Tresca was editor of an Italian socialist newspaper and secretary of the Italian Federation of Railroad Workers before he emigrated to the United States in 1904. After a three-year spell as secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America, he joined the Industrial Workers of the World in 1912, and was involved in strikes across the United States over the rest of the decade. He was jailed in 1925 after printing an advertisement for a birth control pamphlet in one of his newspapers. During the 1930s, Tresca was a staunch critic of both Benito Mussolini's fascist government in Italy and Stalinism in the Soviet Union. In 1937, he was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. Tresca also used his newspapers to mount a public campaign criticising the Mafia. He was assassinated in New York in January 1943, probably by a Mafia gunman. Personal life Carlo Tresca was born March 9, 1879, in Sulmona, Abruzzo, Italy, the son of a landowner.Solon DeLeon with Irma C. Hayssen and Grace Poole (eds.), The American Labor Who's Who. New York: Hanford Press, 1925; pp. 231-232. His formal education reached to secondary school. Tresca had no hope of attending university as his family's finances were poor during the economic slump of the 1880s. He enrolled at a seminary instead, but left soon after, emerging as an anticlerical atheist. From 1898 to 1902, Tresca was secretary of the Italian Federation of Railroad Workers. He was also the editor of Il Germe, a socialist weekly based in Abruzzo. Seeking to avoid a jail term for his radical political activities, Tresca emigrated to the United States in 1904, settling in Philadelphia. Tresca had a relationship with Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, and Flynn's sister, Bina, and was the father of Bina's son Peter D. Martin. He also had a relationship with sculptor Minna Harkavy, whose bust of him was erected in his birth town of Sulmona. American years In America, Tresca was elected Secretary of the Italian Socialist Federation of North America in 1904. He remained in that position for the next three years. During this same interval, Tresca was also the editor of Il Proletario (The Proletarian), the official newspaper of the Italian Socialist Federation. Tresca's political views became increasingly radical and he soon came to identify himself as an anarchist. In 1907 Tresca resigned as editor of Il Proletario and began publishing his own newspaper, La Plebe (The Plebeian). He would later transfer La Plebe to Pittsburgh and, with it, revolutionary ideas to Italian miners and mill workers in Western Pennsylvania. In 1909, Tresca became editor of L'Avvenire, (The Future) remaining in that capacity until the coming of World War I, when the publication was suppressed under the Espionage Act. Paterson silk strike leaders Patrick Quinlan, Tresca, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Adolph Lessig, and Bill Haywood Tresca joined the revolutionary syndicalist Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) in 1912, when he was invited by the union to Lawrence, Massachusetts to help mobilize the Italian workers during a campaign to free strike leaders Joseph Ettor and Arturo Giovannitti, jailed on false murder charges. After the victorious strike in Lawrence, Tresca was active in several strikes across the United States; the Little Falls, New York textile workers' strike (1912), the New York City hotel workers' strike (1913), the Paterson silk strike (1913), and the Mesabi Range, Minnesota, miners' strike (1916). He was arrested several times and jailed for nine months awaiting trial for murder in conjunction with the Minnesota action, ultimately being released without going to trial. Americans march in a \\"Sympathy Labor Parade\\" for Carlo Tresca, 1916 In August 1920, Tresca became involved tangentially in the Irish War of Independence. As Sidney Czira, secretary of Cumann na mBan in New York, and sister of Grace Gifford, later recalled, \\"Picketing of the British Embassy in Washington had been going on from 1916 onwards and I remember a very successful picketing that was undertaken as a protest in New York against the British arrest of Dr. Mannix in August 1920. This latter picketing was largely the work of an Italian called Carlo Tresca, a personal friend of the well-known Irish-American family of Flynn, who were great friends of James Connolly. Tresca had great influence among the sea-faring fraternity and suggested that we should call out the seamen from the British ships as a protest against the arrest of Dr. Mannix. This was done by pickets walking on the docks with placards, calling on the men to leave the ships. So far as I was concerned, this was rather an amusing incident, because I had a placard which read something like this, \\"Hear the call of the blood and refuse to work on British ships\\". I realised that the call of the blood was addressed to Greeks, Italians, Lascars, etc., and when they saw a young woman with a placard they came up to enquire what the strike was about. My efforts to translate \\"Hear the call of the blood\\" into Italian were funny, but I found one word which they all seemed to know was \\"tyranny - Irlanda\\", and smiling and nodding, they would all walk away. The picketing was extremely effective because when we were holding our meetings it was a thrilling sight when, from time to time, we would hear the march of feet and the crew of some ship would come marching into the room. We found out subsequently that Tresca, who had organised them, was generally supposed to be an anarchist! Of course, there were extremely severe penalties under American law for behaviour of this kind.\\"Page 48 of Witness Statement 909 to the Irish BUREAU OF MILITARY HISTORY, 1913-21 In August 1923, Tresca was arrested on charges of having printed an advertisement for a birth control pamphlet in his new publication, Il Martello (The Hammer). He was found guilty in an October 1923 trial and was sentenced to a year and a day in Atlanta Federal Penitentiary. This sentence was confirmed on November 10, 1924, and Tresca entered prison on January 5, 1925. Making enemies Tresca became a major figure among Italian-Americans for his opposition to fascism and was reported to Benito Mussolini as a leading enemy of the fascist movement. Tresca edited an anti-Fascist newspaper named Il Martello, where he attacked the myths that undergirded Mussolini's power. Tresca was monitored by the United States Department of Justice, who sought to deport him, and by Rome, where Mussolini feared that Italian-Americans would hurt his reputation with the United States and its banks. With pressure from the Italian ambassador to ban Tresca's newspaper, the American government charged Tresca with publishing obscenities. Tresca was sentenced and subject to deportation, but public dissent led the United States President Calvin Coolidge to commute Tresca's sentence. The fascists turned to violence, with a bombing assassination attempt in 1926, after which the antifascists fought back. Tresca contributed towards stopping Mussolini's ideological spread among Italian-Americans, despite Tresca's lack of reach into Italian-American media and business influence. During the trial of Sacco and Vanzetti, Tresca organized publicity, fundraising, and the defense lawyer Fred Moore. In the 1930s, Tresca became an outspoken opponent of Soviet Communists and Stalinism, particularly after the Soviet Union had engineered the destruction of the anarchist movement in Catalonia and Aragon during the Spanish Revolution. In 1937, Tresca was a member of the Dewey Commission, which cleared Leon Trotsky of all charges made during the Moscow Trials. In early 1938, Tresca publicly accused the Soviets of kidnapping Juliet Stuart Poyntz to prevent her defection from the Communist Party USA underground apparatus. Tresca alleged that before she had disappeared, Poyntz had talked to him about \\"exposing the communist movement\\". Assassination By 1943, Tresca, on parole at the time, was under police surveillance. On January 9, 1943, his surveillance team witnessed an incident in which a speeding car attempted to run Tresca over. Two days later, on January 11, 1943, in New York City, Tresca was leaving his parole officer's offices when he dodged surveilling officers by jumping into a car that was waiting for him. Two hours later, Tresca was crossing Fifth Avenue at 15th Street on foot when a black Ford pulled up beside him. A short, squat gunman in a brown coat jumped out and shot Tresca in the back of the head with a handgun, killing him instantly. The black Ford was later found abandoned nearby with all four doors open. One theory at the time was that the suspected assassin was a member of the Mafia, acting on orders from Sicily. Others have theorized that Tresca was eliminated by the NKVD as retribution for criticism of the Stalin regime of the Soviet Union. More recent research by Alan A. Block in Space, Time and Organized Crime, Dorothy Gallagher in All the Right Enemies, and Nunzio Pernicone in Carlo Tresca: Portrait of A Rebel all confirm that the most likely scenario is that Tresca was killed by Carmine Galante, of the Bonanno crime family, on the order of Frank Garofalo, underboss to Joseph Bonanno, Fascist sympathizer and close friend to Generoso Pope. Tresca had not only been critical of Pope but recently berated Garofalo and threatened to expose him in Il Martello. Galante, only recently released from prison, was seen by his parole officer fleeing the scene. Unfortunately, due to wartime rationing of gasoline, the parole officer was unable to engage in a chase after him. Vito Genovese, boss of the Genovese crime family, is also said to have allegedly ordered the murder of Tresca, with the shooter allegedly being Galante. No one was ever charged in the Tresca murder. A eulogy at his memorial service was delivered by Angelica Balabanoff, socialist activist and former Bolshevik. According to Lewis Coser's account of the funeral, \\"I was sitting near a burly Irish policeman who clearly didn't understand a word of Balabanoff's fierce Italian oratory. But at her climax he burst into tears.\\"Lewis Coser, \\"From a Heroic Past.\\" Dissent, Summer 1989.

It is colloquially known as the little bluebill or broadbill because of its distinctive blue bill. The origin of the name scaup may stem from the bird's preference for feeding on scalp‚Äîthe Scottish word for clams, oysters, and mussels; however, some credit it to the female's discordant scaup call as the name's source. It is apparently a very close relative of the Holarctic greater scaup or \\"bluebill\\" (A. marila), with which it forms a superspecies. The scientific name is derived from Ancient Greek aithuia an unidentified seabird mentioned by authors including Hesychius and Aristotle, and Latin, affinis \\"related to\\", from its resemblance to the greater scaup. Description Adults are long, on average. The species can weigh ; males weigh on average and weigh noticeably less, at on average. Wing lengths (not wingspans) are about in males and in females; the tarsus is about long, and the bill . The wingspan is . The adult males (drakes) in alternate plumage have a black, iridescent head and a small tuft at the hindcrown, a black breast, a whitish-grey back and wings with darker vermiculations and black outer and greyish-brown inner primary remiges. The underparts are white with some olive vermiculations on the flanks, and the rectrices and tail coverts are black. Adult females (hens) have a white band at the base of the bill, often a lighter ear region, and are otherwise dark brown all over, shading to white on the mid-belly. Drakes in eclipse plumage look similar, but with a very dark head and breast, little or no white on the head and usually some greyish vermiculations on the wings. Immature birds resemble the adult females, but are duller and have hardly any white at the bill base. Both sexes have white secondary remiges, a blue-grey bill with a black \\"nail\\" at the tip and grey feet; the drakes have a bright yellow iris, while that of females is orange or amber and that of immatures is brown. Downy hatchlings look much like those of related species, with dark brown upperparts and pale buff underparts, chin, supercilium and back spots. These birds are not very vocal, at least compared to dabbling ducks. Hens give the namesake discordant scaup, scaup call; in courtship drakes produce weak whistles. Hens vocalize more often than those of the greater scaup‚Äîparticularly during flight‚Äîbut their call is weaker, a guttural brrtt, brrtt. =Identification= file:Lesser Scaup 2.jpgLesser scaup drake in alternate plumage. Note typical head shape; purple sheen visible on neck. File:Greater scaup male.jpgGreater scaup drake in alternate plumage. Note typical head shape; green sheen visible on neck. File:Aythya affinis.JPGLesser scaup hen. Note amber iris. File:Greater scaup female.jpgGreater scaup hen. Note bright yellow iris. Lesser scaup are often hard to distinguish from the greater scaup when direct comparison is not possible, but in North America a large scaup flock will often have both species present. Females, juveniles and drakes in eclipse plumage are hard to identify; there is considerable overlap in length between the two species, but greater scaup are usually noticeably more bulky. Lesser scaup females and immatures tend to have less white around the bill, but this too varies considerably between individual birds. The bill may give a hint; in the lesser scaup it has a stronger curve on the upperside than in the greater, resulting in a distal part that looks somewhat flattened and wide in the lesser scaup‚Äîhence the vernacular name \\"broadbill\\". If the birds fly, the most tell-tale sign is the white secondary remiges, whereas in the greater scaup the white extends on the primary remiges also, i.e. far towards the wingtip. Drake of the ring-necked duck (A. collaris) in alternate plumage. Note black wings. Lesser scaup females show the characteristic darker iris (bright yellow in greater scaup males and females) at closer distances. Lesser scaup drakes in nuptial plumage are often said to be recognizable by the purple instead of green sheen of the head and a darker back. But this is unreliable because it varies according to light conditions, and these birds are often too far away from the observer to make out any sheen at all. The best trait‚Äîif the primary remiges are not visible‚Äîis the shape of the head: in the greater scaup drake, the forehead is usually quite massive, whereas the nape presents a smooth shallow curve and may appear almost straightly sloping. The lesser scaup drake presents the opposite shape, with a less bulging forehead and a nape that looks strongly curved or even angular due to the small crest. When the birds raise their heads, these differences are most easy to spot, and after observing the two species in direct comparison it usually becomes easy to recognize. In fact, in alternate plumage the lesser scaup drake may appear identical in shape and size to a drake of the ring-necked duck (A. collaris); the black back and wings of that species are hard to confuse with the light ones of the lesser scaup male though. Hybridization Particularly in the case of vagrant birds in Europe, the identification is complicated by similar-looking Aythya hybrids. Except for hybrids between the two scaup species, the most reliable mark is the black bill-tip of hybrids, whereas in the scaups only the very point (\\"nail\\") of the bill is black. This is even recognizable at considerable range, as the scaups' bills appear uniformly grey from a distance, whereas those of hybrids look two-colored. European hybrids typically involve the tufted duck (A. fuligula), yielding offspring that have a small nape crest unlike any European Aythya species. Female and immature hybrids typically lack the white bill base, except in those between lesser scaup and ring-necked duck, where the white extends to the eye region. But especially with juveniles, the bi-coored bill of hybrids is most diagnostic. Hybrid combinations that are known from the wild and resemble the lesser scaup are: * The occurrence of hybridization between lesser and greater scaup in the wild is disputed. Such hybrids could only be identified with certainty by DNA sequence comparison however. But while they may exist unnoticed, they cannot be frequent, as the species are largely sympatric and closely related, yet remain distinct, with no signs of significant introgression. * Hybrids between lesser scaup and ring-necked ducks are recognizable by very dark wings contrasting with a light grey underside more than in the lesser scaup but less than in the ring-necked duck. * Hybrids between the lesser scaup and the redhead (A. americana) are recognizable by the lack of contrast between wings and belly and the dull brownish head. * Hybrids between the tufted duck and the common pochard (A. ferina) are almost indistinguishable from lesser scaup, though neither parent species resembles A. affinis. In theory, each and every Aythya species is able to produce potentially fertile hybrids with any other, though due to their different ranges and behavioral cues given during courtship most of these hybrids are only known from birds kept in captivity without conspecific mates.  Taxonomy  Two syntype specimens of Fuligula affinis Eyton (Monogr. Anat., 1838, p.157.) are held in the collections of National Museums Liverpool at World Museum, with accession numbers D826c (female adult) and D826b (male adult). The specimens were collected in North America and came to the Liverpool national collection via Thomas Campbell Eyton‚Äôs collection and the 13th Earl of Derby‚Äôs collection which was bequeathed to the city of Liverpool.  Distribution and migration  Their breeding habitat is inland lakes and marsh ponds in tundra from Alaska through western Canada to western Montana; few breed east of James Bay and the Great Lakes. Notable breeding concentrations, with more than half a million birds at the height of the season, can be found in Alaska, in the woodlands of the McKenzie River valley and on the Old Crow Flats. These birds migrate south (mostly via the Central and Mississippi Flyways) when the young are fledged and return early spring, usually arriving on the breeding ground in May. Lesser scaup typically travel in flocks of 25‚Äì50 birds and winter mainly on lakes, rivers and sheltered coastal lagoons and bays between the US‚ÄìCanada border and northern Colombia, including Central America, the West Indies and Bermuda. Wintering lesser scaup are typically found in freshwater or slightly brackish habitat and unlike greater scaup rarely are seen offshore when unfrozen freshwater habitat is available. They may even spend the winter on lakes in parks, as long as they are not harassed, and will occur even on smallish Caribbean islands such as Grand Cayman. Thousands winter each year on the Topolobampo lagoons in Mexico, and even in the southernmost major wintering location‚ÄîCi√©naga Grande de Santa Marta in Colombia‚Äîhundreds of birds can be seen. In Central America, flocks are present from July on, but only really numerous after September. They move north again in April and May. In the extreme southeast and southwest of the breeding range‚Äîthe Rocky Mountains region of the northwestern United States and the southern Great Lakes‚Äîlesser scaup are present all-year; it is not clear whether the breeding birds are replaced by migrants from the far north in winter, or whether the local populations do not migrate, or whether both local and migrant birds are found there in winter. They are rarely‚Äîbut apparently increasingly often‚Äîseen as vagrants in western Europe. The first documented British record was a first- winter male at Chasewater, Staffordshire in 1987 but by 2006, over 60 had been recorded, with an average of 2 per year. UK records are typically in the northern parts of the country. Vagrant lesser scaup have also been recorded on the Hawaiian Islands Japan, possibly China, and‚Äîfor the first time on 18 January 2000‚Äîin the Marianas, as well as in Ecuador, Surinam, Trinidad and Venezuela (in winter), and Greenland (in summer). Ecology Lesser scaup forage mainly by sifting through the bottom mud, usually after diving and swimming underwater, occasionally by dabbling without diving. They mainly eat mollusks such as mussels and clams, as well as seeds and other parts of aquatic plants like sedges and bulrushes (Cyperaceae), \\"pondweeds\\", widgeon- grass (Ruppia cirrhosa), wild celery (Vallisneria americana) or wild rice (Zizania). In winter, but less so in summer, other aquatic animals‚Äîcrustacean, insect and their larvae and small fishes‚Äîform an important part of their diet. It has been reported that both the lesser and the greater scaup have shifted their traditional migration routes to take advantage of the presence of the zebra mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) in Lake Erie, which was accidentally introduced in the 1980s and has multiplied enormously. This may pose a risk to these birds because zebra mussels are efficient filter feeders and so accumulate environmental contaminants rapidly. They nest in a sheltered location on the ground near water, usually among thick vegetation such as sedges and bulrushes, sometimes in small loose groups and not rarely next to colonies of gulls or terns; several females may deposit eggs in a single nest. The drakes court the hens in the winter quarters; pairs form shortly before and during the spring migration. When nesting starts, the males aggregate while they moult into eclipse plumage, leaving the task of incubation and raising the young to the females alone. The nest is a shallow depression scraped in the ground and lined with plants and some down feathers. Breeding begins in May, but most birds nest only in June, later than usual for North American waterfowl. The clutch numbers about 9‚Äì11 eggs on average; up to 26 eggs have been found in a single nest, but such high numbers are from more than one female. Incubation is by the female only and lasts around 3 weeks. The young fledge some 45‚Äì50 days after hatching and soon thereafter the birds migrate to winter quarters already. Lesser scaup become sexually mature in their first or second summer. The oldest known individual reached an age of over 18 years. Before the start of the population decline (see below), about 57% of the lesser scaup nests failed each breeding season because the female was killed or the eggs were eaten or destroyed. The average brood size of nests where eggs hatched successfully was 8.33 hatchlings. Conservation status Although the lesser scaup has the largest population of any species of diving duck in North America, their population has been steadily declining since the mid-1980s, and reached an all-time low in the early 21sh century. During breeding bird surveys, lesser and greater scaup are counted together due to the impossibility of identifying the species unequivocally when large numbers of birds are involved. Lesser scaup are thought to comprise slightly less than nine-tenths of the scaup population of North America. In the 1970s, the lesser scaup population was estimated at 6.9 million birds on average; in the 1990s it had declined to about half that number, and by the late 2000s it is estimated at 3 million individuals or less. Due to the wide breeding range and the fact that the rate of decline, though remarkable, is still not threatening in respect to the enormous overall numbers, the lesser scaup is classified as a Species of Least Concern by the IUCN. An increase of the decline is liable to result in an uplisting to Near Threatened or even Vulnerable status. The causes for this stark‚Äîthough not threatening yet‚Äîdecline remain unknown. There are indications that the breeding success is decreasing, but why this is so remains puzzling. On one hand, pollution and habitat destruction, especially in the wintering regions, has certainly increased since the early-mid 20th century. On the other hand, the narrow time frame in which lesser scaup breed and raise their young may be tied to some specific ecological conditions‚Äîsuch as abundance of key food items‚Äîwhich shifted winterwards due to global warming, without the ducks being able to adapt. In this regard, it is alternatively or additionally possible that greater scaup, which may be increasing in numbers, is putting the lesser scaup under increasingly severe competition. However, it seems that greater scaup eats larger food items on average, and the species are sympatric in part of their range and presumably have been for millennium without any problems due to competition. The experience of the past as well as the reproduction rate‚Äîeven if this is declining‚Äîsuggests that hunting has no major impact on lesser scaup populations at present either. Also, the breeding habitat is mainly in regions little-used by humans; habitat destruction on the breeding grounds is also not considered to be problematic.

Fard, also known as Wallace Fard Muhammad (; reportedly born February 26, ‚Äì ), was the founder of the Nation of Islam. He arrived in Detroit in 1930 with an obscure background and several aliases, and taught an idiosyncratic form of Islam to members of the city's black population. In 1934, he disappeared from public record, and Elijah Muhammad succeeded him as leader of the Nation of Islam.  Influence  Master Fard Muhammad, acting as a door-to-door travelling salesman, spread his religious teachings throughout Detroit, and within three years grew the movement to a reported 8,000-9,000 members in Detroit, Chicago and other cities. Today, the Nation of Islam has an estimated membership of 20,000‚Äì50,000. The annual Saviour's Day event is held in honor of Master Fard's birth. In 2020, it attracted an estimated 14,000 members. Fard taught a form of Black exceptionalism and self-pride to poor southern Blacks during the Great Northward Migration at a time when old ideas of scientific racism were prevalent. He advocated community members to own their own businesses, eat healthy, raise families, and refrain from drugs and alcohol. He influenced his successor Elijah Muhammad, Malcolm X and many other black nationalist thinkers. Detractors accuse him of being a con man who used mystery and charisma to swindle poor Blacks by selling them new Muslim names and stirring up racial animosity. Beynon's account of Fard and his followers In 1938, sociologist Erdmann Doane Beynon published in the American Journal of Sociology a firsthand account of several interviews he conducted with followers of Fard in Michigan. From those interviews, Beynon wrote that Fard lived and taught in Detroit from 1930 to 1934. He came to the homes of black families who had recently migrated to Detroit from the rural South. He began by selling silks door to door, telling his listeners that the silks came from their home country. At his suggestion, he came back to teach the residents, along with guests. In the early stage of his ministry, Fard \\"used the Bible as his textbook, since it was the only religious book with which the majority of his hearers were familiar. With growing prestige over a constantly increasing group, [Fard] became bolder in his denunciation of the Caucasians and began to attack the teachings of the Bible in such a way as to shock his hearers and bring them to an emotional crisis.\\" Beynon's interviewees told him that reports of Fard's message spread throughout the black community. Attendance at the house meetings grew until the listeners were divided into groups and taught in shifts. Finally, the community contributed money and rented a hall to serve as a Temple where meetings were conducted. The Quran was soon introduced as the most authoritative of all texts for the study of the faith. Fard prepared texts that served as authoritative manuals of the faith and were memorized verbatim by his followers. Beynon described disputes and tension that arose between the new community and the police over the group's refusal to send their children to public schools. One member of the group, later declared mentally insane, allegedly participated in \\"human sacrifice\\" in 1932 in an effort to follow lessons regarding the sacrifice of devils.Beynon stated that Fard's position on human sacrifice \\"was never made clear.\\" These incidents drew police attention, according to Beynon, and contributed to persecutions and schisms. Fard named his community the Nation of Islam. Following the rapid increase in membership, he instituted a formal organizational structure. He established the University of Islam, where school age children were taught, rather than in the public schools. He established the Moslem Girls' Training and General Civilization Class, where women were taught how to keep their houses, clean, and cook. The men of the organization were drilled by captains and referred to as the Fruit of Islam. The entire movement was placed under a Minister of Islam. According to Beynon, Fard's followers grew to approximately eight thousand. \\"Within three years the prophet not only began the movement but organized it so well that he himself was able to recede into the background, appearing almost never to his followers during the final months of his residence in Detroit.\\" From interviews with approximately 200 families who followed Fard, Beynon concluded: > \\"Although the prophet lived in Detroit from July 4, 1930 until June 30, > 1934, virtually nothing is known about him, save that he 'came from the > East' and that he 'called' the Negroes of North America to enter the Nation > of Islam. His very name is uncertain. He was known usually as Mr. Wali > Farrad or Mr. W. D. Fard, though he used also the following names: Professor > Ford, Mr. Farrad Mohammed, Mr. F. Mohammed Ali. One of the few survivors who > heard his first addresses states that he himself said: 'My name is W. D. > Fard and I came from the Holy City of Mecca. More about myself I will not > tell you yet, for the time has not yet come. I am your brother. You have not > yet seen me in my royal robes.' Legends soon sprang up about this mysterious > personality.\\" Fard used the name W. F. Muhammad on several lessons written in 1933 and 1934. In 1933, he began signing his name W. F. Muhammad, which stands for Wallace Fard Muhammad.  Arrest and Disappearance  Fard left Detroit and faded from public life in the aftermath of the murder of James J. Smith on November 20, 1932. Smith had been killed by Robert Harris on a make-shift altar in what was described as a human sacrifice. Harris attended meetings of the Detroit chapter Nation of Islam, then also called the Order of Islam, and Allah Temple of Islam, where he was given the name of Robert Karriem. He claimed he was influenced by the group and Fard and another leader, Ugan Ali, were arrested and questioned. \\"The society cannot be blamed for anything he did,\\" Ali was quoted in the Detroit News, Nov. 23, 1932. \\"Harris had no standing in the order and was not regarded as a leader. Many people avoided him because of the wild things he sometimes said.\\" Harris was later declared mentally unbalanced, pleaded guilty and was imprisoned, while Fard and Ali were released.  Efforts to trace Fard's history 1914-1926 Karl Evanzz of The Washington Post submitted a Freedom of Information Act request to the FBI in 1978 requesting its file on Fard. Evanzz based his account of Fard's life on the declassified portion of the FBI file that he received about a decade after his request. Evanzz detailed the experience of several other authors who also based their accounts of Fard's life on the FBI file. From the FBI's response to the Freedom of Information Act request, Evanzz claimed that Fard, using the name Fred Dodd, married Pearl Allen in Multnomah County, Oregon, on May 9, 1914, with their first child, a son, born the next year. Dodd left his family in 1916 and moved to Los Angeles, using the name Wallie Dodd Ford. A World War I draft registration card for Wallie Dodd Fard from 1917 indicated he was living in Los Angeles, unmarried, as a restaurant owner, and reported that he was born in Shinka, Afghanistan on February 26, 1893. He was described as of medium height and build with brown eyes and black hair. On the draft card, \\"Ford\\" is written in parentheses. No reason is given. At the bottom of the card, he signed his name as \\"Wallie Dodd Ford\\". A declassified Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) memorandum dated May 16, 1957 states: \\"From a review of instant file it does not appear that there has been a concerted effort to locate and fully identify W. D. Fard. In as much as Elijah Muhammad recognizes W.D. Fard as being Allah (God) and claims that Fard is the source of all of his teachings, it is suggested that an exhaustive effort be made to fully identify and locate W. D. Fard and/or members of his family.\\"FBI File SAC (25-20607) at 476 The FBI took note of the article written by Erdmann Doane Beynon, and it conducted a search for Fard using various aliases including the name \\"Ford\\".FBI File SAC (100-26356) at 451-473, SAC Chicago (100-33683) The search produced two Fords of interest, one of whom was Wallace Ford, a prominent movie actor. The other was Wallie D. Ford of California, arrested by Los Angeles police on November 17, 1918 on a charge of assault with a deadly weapon, As of 1920, Ford was still living in Los Angeles as 26-year-old Wallie D. Ford, with his 25-year-old wife, Hazel. In the 1920 United States Census his race was reported as white, his occupation as a proprietor of a restaurant, and his place of birth as New Zealand. He provided no known place of birth for his parents nor his date of immigration.1920 Federal U.S. Census, Los Angeles City, Enumeration District 206, Sheet 10B On October 17, 1957, the FBI located and interviewed Hazel Barton-Ford, Wallie Ford's common-law wife, with whom he had a son named Wallace Dodd Ford, born September 1, 1920.FBI File SAC LA (105-4805) at 135 Barton-Ford gave a description of Wallie Ford, and described him as a Caucasian New Zealander. The FBI's search for Fard was officially closed one year later on April 15, 1958.FBI File Director FBI (105-63642) at 248, SAC Chicago (100-33683) Immigration records did not match any of his aliases. His true identity remains unknown, but there is strong evidence that the Nation of Islam founder Wallace D. Fard was the same man as Wallace Dodd Ford, an inmate in San Quentin Prison. According to Patrick D. Bowen, a PhD candidate at the University of Denver's Iliff School of Theology, fingerprints and photographs taken from San Quentin Prison matched those involved with Fard during the 1930s in Detroit. A marriage certificate dated June 5, 1924, was issued to Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Trevino in Orange County, California. Ford reported he was a cook, age 26, born in Oregon, but living in Los Angeles.California State Board of Health, County of Orange, Certificate of Marriage, Local Registered No. 1768, as located in \\"California, County Marriages, 1850‚Äì1952\\", index and images, FamilySearch (https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.1.1/K8FM-5FP: accessed January 5, 2013), Wallie Dodd Ford and Carmen Frevino, 1924. The FBI took note of the article written by Erdmann Doane Beynon, and it conducted a search for Fard using various aliases including the name \\"Ford\\".FBI File SAC (100-26356) at 451-473, SAC Chicago (100-33683) Fard was arrested again on January 20, 1926, for violation of the California Woolwine Possession Act, and on February 15, 1926, for violation of the State Poison Act, for which he was sentenced to six months to six years at San Quentin State Prison on June 12, 1926.FBI File SAC (100-43165-16) According to San Quentin records, Wallie D. Ford was born in Portland, Oregon on February 25, 1891, the white son of Zared and Beatrice Ford, who were both born in Hawaii.FBI report CG 100-3386, page 2. \\"FBI report CG 100-3386\\", FBI Records: The Vault; retrieved October 14, 2015. On August 15, 1959, the FBI sent a story to the Chicago New Crusader newspaper, stating that Fard was a \\"Turkish-born Nazi agent who worked for Hitler in World War II\\". According to the FBI story, Fard was a \\"Muslim from Turkey who had come to the United States in the early 1900s. He had met Muhammad in prison ‚Ä¶ where the two men plotted a confidence game in which followers were charged a fee to become Muslims.\\" After the story was published, Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X subsequently charged Black media outlets, who reprinted the accusation in large numbers, with running the story without requesting a response from the Nation of Islam. A February 19, 1963, FBI memorandum states: \\"In connection with efforts to disrupt and curb growth of the NOI, extensive research has been conducted into various files maintained by this office. Among the files reviewed was that of Wallace Dodd Ford.\\"FBI File Director, FBI (25-330971) at 258, SAC Chicago (100-35635) Five months later, in July 1963, the FBI told the Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner that Fard was actually Wallace Dodd Ford. The paper published the story in an article titled \\"Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White.\\"\\"Black Muslim Founder Exposed As White\\", Los Angeles Evening Herald-Examiner, July 28, 1963 An FBI memorandum dated August 1963 states that the FBI had not been able to verify his birthdate or birthplace, and \\"he was last heard from in 1934.\\" The Nation of Islam refutes the claim that Fard and Ford are one and the same in an article posted on the NOI website by Dr. Wesley Muhammad. Karl Evanzz, in his book The Messenger, postulates that Fard was the son of a Pakistani Muslim, then known as East Indians. He bases this theory on several indications: # Fard spent time at the Ahmadiyya Mosque, a movement prominent in Pakistan and used transitions of the Quran from Pakistanis. # The name Fard is a common surname in Pakistan as are other names he bestowed upon his followers such as Shabazz, Ghulam, and Kallatt # Interviews with long-time Nation figures who met him or saw original photos of him such as Ozier Muhammad, Rodnell Collins (nephew of Malcolm X) and Wilfred Little indicate that Fard has Pakistani features # Early teachings from Fard indicated a distrust and disdain for Hinduism The 2019 book Finding W.D. Fard: Unveiling the Identity of the Founder of the Nation of Islam by Dr. John Andrew Morrow investigates theories of Fard's origin. \\"The people who actually met him, and the scholars who have studied him, have suggested that he was variously an African American, an Arab from Syria, Lebanon, Algeria, Morocco or Saudi Arabia... a Turk, an Afghan, an Indo-Pakistani... a Greek...\\" Morrow writes. \\"In an attempt to determine the origins of W.D. Fard, most scholars have relied on his teachings as passed down, and perhaps modified, by Elijah Muhammad. Some have suggested that he was a member of the Moorish Science Temple of America or the Ahmadiyyah Movement. Others have suggested that he was a Druze or a Shiite.\\" Chameleon: The True Story of W.D. Fard by A. K. Arian studies the origin of the Nation of Islam founder. One theory postulated is that Fard was of Afghani heritage. =Moorish Science Temple of America= In addition to his assertion that Fard was Ford, Evanzz also said that Fard was once a member of the Moorish Science Temple of America, citing as a primary source the 1945 publication by Arna Bontemps and Jack Conroy titled They Seek A City. Authors have also cited E. U. Essien-Udom for this proposition as well. In his 1962 book Black Nationalism: The Search for an Identity, Essien-Udom wrote: > \\"Noble Drew Ali was shot and stabbed in his offices at the Unity Club in > Chicago on the night of March 15, 1929 ‚Ä¶ He was eventually released on bond, > but a few weeks later, he died under mysterious circumstances. Some people > claim that he died from injuries inflicted by the police while he was in > jail. Others, however, suggest that he was killed by [Sheik Claude] Greene's > partisans. For some time, one W. D. Fard assumed leadership of the Moorish > movement. According to Bontemps and Conroy, Fard claimed that he was the > reincarnation of Noble Drew Ali.

However, Minister Malcolm X and other > leaders of the Nation of Islam have emphatically denied any past connection > whatsoever of Elijah Muhammad, Master Wallace Fard Muhammad, or their > movement with Nobel Drew Ali's Moorish American Science Temple.\\" On the question of a connection between the Nation of Islam and the Moorish Science Temple of America, Beynon wrote: > \\"Awakened already to a consciousness of race discrimination, these migrants > from the South came into contact with militant movements among northern > Negroes. Practically none of them had been in the North prior to the > collapse of the Marcus Garvey movement. A few of them had come under the > influence of the Moorish-American cult which succeeded it. The effect of > both these movements upon the future members of the Nation of Islam was > largely indirect. Garvey taught the Negroes that their homeland was > Ethiopia. The Noble Drew Ali, the prophet of the Moorish-Americans, > proclaimed that these people were 'descendants of Morrocans [Moroccans]'.\\" Beynon also wrote: \\"The prophet‚Äôs message was characterized by his ability to utilize to the fullest measure the environment of his followers. Their physical and economic difficulties alike were used to illustrate the new teaching. Similarly, biblical prophecies and the teachings of Marcus Garvey and Noble Drew Ali were cited as foretelling the coming of the new prophet\\". Relationship with Elijah Muhammad With regard to Elijah Muhammad, Beynon's article stated: \\"From among the larger group of Muslims there has sprung recently an even more militant branch than the Nation of Islam itself. This new movement, known as the Temple People, identifies the prophet, Mr. W. D. Fard, with the god Allah. To Mr. Fard alone do they offer prayer and sacrifice. Since Mr. Fard has been deified, the Temple People raise to the rank of prophet the former Minister of Islam, Elijah Mohammed, now a resident of Chicago. He is always referred to reverently as the 'Prophet Elijah in Chicago. Elijah Muhammad, who led the Nation of Islam from 1934 to 1975, heard Fard teach for the first time in 1931.Muhammad, Elijah (1964), Historic 1964 Buzz Anderson Interview, The Final Call Elijah Muhammad stated that he and Fard became inseparable between 1931 and 1934, where he felt \\"jailed almost\\" due to the amount of time that they spent together with Fard teaching him day and night. A hand-written lesson written by Fard states: > \\"Twelve Leaders of Islam from all over the Planet have conferred in the Root > of Civilization concerning the Lost-Found Nation of Islam ‚Äì must return to > their original Land. One of the Conference Members by the name of Mr. Osman > Sharrieff said to the Eleven Members of the Conference: 'The Lost-Found > Nation of Islam will not return to their original Land unless they, first, > have a thorough Knowledge of their own.' So they sent a Messenger to them of > their own. Now, the Messenger and his Laborers worked day and night for the > last three and one-half years, and their accomplishments are approximately > twenty-five thousand...\\" In this lesson, Fard places the number of converts obtained in Detroit at twenty-five thousand, and he describes a \\"Messenger\\" sent to the \\"Lost-Found Nation of Islam\\" who is \\"of their own\\". Nation of Islam theology states that this \\"Messenger\\" is Elijah Muhammad.Muhammad, Jabril (1993) This is The One The Most Honored Elijah Muhammad We Need Not Look For Another, Vol. 1 Fard wrote, in his instructions to the leaders of his community, that they should \\"copy the Answers of Lesson of Minister Elijah Muhammad.\\" He went on to state: \\"Why is Stress made to the Muslims to Copy, the Minister, Elijah Muhammad's Answers? The past History shows that the ALMIGHTY ALLAH sends Prophets and Apostles for the people's Guide and Example, and through them HIS Mystery was Revealed. And those who follow the Apostle would see the Light.\\" Fard wrote several lessons which are read and committed to memory by members of the Nation of Islam.Beynon refers to some of the lessons by Fard as an \\"oral tradition\\" that was recorded at the University of Islam as the \\"Secret Ritual of the Nation of Islam.\\" See . Authors have subsequently attributed a text of this title to Fard. See Evanzz, supra at 81. However, Fard's lessons were individually written lessons later compiled in a single publication. See . Language attributed to Fard by author Karl Evanzz does not appear in any of the individually written lessons. Some of the lessons are in the form of questions asked by Fard to Elijah Muhammad. One such lesson concludes with the text: \\"This Lesson No. 2 was given by our Prophet, W.D. Fard, which contains 40 questions answered by Elijah Muhammad, one of the lost found in the wilderness of North America February 20th, 1934.\\" Ideology Beynon described the substance of Fard's teaching as follows: > \\"The black men in North America are not Negroes, but members of the lost > tribe of Shabazz, stolen by traders from the Holy City of Mecca 379 years > ago. The prophet came to America to find and to bring back to life his long > lost brethren, from whom the Caucasians had taken away their language, their > nation and their religion. Here in America they were living other than > themselves. They must learn that they are the original people, noblest of > the nations of the earth. The Caucasians are the colored people, since they > have lost their original color. The original people must regain their > religion, which is Islam, their language, which is Arabic, and their > culture, which is astronomy and higher mathematics, especially calculus. > They must live according to the law of Allah, avoiding all meat of 'poison > animals', hogs, ducks, geese, possums and catfish. They must give up > completely the use of stimulants, especially liquor. They must clean > themselves up ‚Äì both their bodies and their houses. If in this way they > obeyed Allah, he would take them back to the Paradise from which they had > been stolen ‚Äì the Holy City of Mecca.\\" Fard's lessons actually state that the \\"trader\\" referenced by Beynon, came to Africa, not Mecca. Modern Nation of Islam theology is based upon the belief that Fard's teaching of Elijah Muhammad was fulfillment of scripture regarding God's teaching of an Apostle, where Fard is described as \\"God in Person\\", the \\"Messiah\\", and the \\"Mahdi\\". Fard wrote the following for his followers: > \\"[T]he LESSONS that OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH) gave us to Study and Learn is the > Fulfillment of the Prophecies of All the Former Prophets concerning the > Beginning of the Devils, and the Ending of the Civilization, and of our > Enslavement by the Devils, and Present Time of our Delivery from the Devils > by OUR SAVIOUR (ALLAH). PRAISE HIS HOLY NAME! There is No God but ALLAH. How > that ALLAH would separate us from the Devils and, then destroy them; and > Change us into a New and Perfect People; and Fill the Earth with FREEDOM, > JUSTICE and EQUALITY as it was filled with wickedness; and Making we, the > Poor Lost-Founds, the Perfect RULERS.\\" In his 1965 book Message to the Blackman in America, which is a compilation of articles written by Elijah Muhammad for newspapers throughout the early part of his Ministry, he summarized what Fard taught him as follows: > \\"He began teaching us the knowledge of ourselves, of God and the devil, of > the measurement of the earth, of other planets, and of the civilization of > some of the planets other than earth. ... He measured and weighed the earth > and its water; the history of the moon; the history of the two nations, > black and white, that dominate the earth. He gave the exact birth of the > white race; the name of their God who made them and how; and the end of > their time, the judgment, how it will begin and end. ... He taught us the > truth of how we were made 'slaves' and how we are kept in slavery by the > 'slave-masters children. He declared the doom of America, for her evils to > us was past due. And that she is number one to be destroyed. Her judgment > could not take place until we hear the truth. ... He declared that we were > without the knowledge of self or anyone else. How we had been made blind, > deaf and dumb by this white race of people and how we must return to our > people, our God and His religion of peace (Islam), the religion of the > prophets. We must give up the slave names of our slave-masters and accept > the name of Allah (God) or one of His divine attributes. He also taught us > to give up all evil doings and practices and do righteousness or be > destroyed from the face of the earth. He taught us that the slave-masters > had taught us to eat the wrong food and that this is the cause of our > sickness and short span of life. He declared that he would heal us and set > us in heaven at once, if we would submit to Him. Otherwise he would chastise > us with a severe chastisement until we did submit. And that He was able to > force the whole world into submission to his will. He said that he loved us > (the so-called Negroes), his lost and found, so well that he would eat > rattlesnakes to free us if necessary, for he has power over all things.\\" Part of Fard's teaching also involved admiration for Japan. He was linked to the Pacific Movement of the Eastern World and Japanese agitators such as Satokata Takahashi, and Ashima Takis. The FBI charged that Takahaski had been an influential presence in the Nation of Islam. He spoke as a guest at the NOI temples in Detroit and Chicago. In popular culture Fard appears in the novel Middlesex, by Jeffrey Eugenides, in which Fard's Detroit Temple No. 1 is the location setting for several scenes in the book. Fard and his teachings are also referenced in many hip-hop songs. Artists who have made references within their music include Jay-Z (\\"I'm going to chase the Yacub back in the cave\\"Jay Z & Jay Electronica, \\"We Made It\\"), Jay Electronica (\\"Lost tribe of Shabazz stylin' on the record\\", \\"The son of W.D., who hung around in the D, Who ran around in the three, The trap gods raised me, Face all on the Sphinx, Story all in the wall of the pyramids, Niggas know the Black God saved me\\"), Brand Nubian (\\"This asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards, The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth, Father of civilization, God of the universe, Manifestin thought with my infinite styles, Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles, The other six I set the crucifix, Because the heart of the problem is this....\\"Brand Nubian, \\"Wake Up\\"), and Ras Kass in the song \\"Riiiot\\" (\\"Now I got niggas claiming they saw God unfortunately, he wasn't in the person of Master Fard Muhammad\\").Chino XL ft/ Ras Kass - \\"Riiiot\\" See also * List of people who disappeared Notes References =Bibliography=    * * External links *FBI file on Wallace Fard *Historical Analysis of FBI's COINTELPRO AND W.

Early Modern Germany, 1477‚Äì1806, MacMillan Press and University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, p. 18. . is a person regarded as having a mutual obligation to a lord or monarch, in the context of the feudal system in medieval Europe. The obligations often included military support by knights in exchange for certain privileges, usually including land held as a tenant or fief.F. L. Ganshof, \\"Benefice and Vassalage in the Age of Charlemagne\\" Cambridge Historical Journal 6.2 (1939:147-75). The term is also applied to similar arrangements in other feudal societies. In contrast, fealty (fidelitas) was sworn, unconditional loyalty to a monarch.Ganshof 151 note 23 and passim; the essential point was made again, and the documents on which the historian's view of vassalage are based were reviewed, with translation and commentary, by Elizabeth Magnou-Nortier, Foi et Fid√©lit√©. Recherches sur l'√©volution des liens personnels chez les Francs du VIIe au IXe si√®cle (University of Toulouse Press) 1975.  Western vassalage  In fully developed vassalage, the lord and the vassal would take part in a commendation ceremony composed of two parts, the homage and the fealty, including the use of Christian sacraments to show its sacred importance. According to Eginhard's brief description, the commendatio made to Pippin the Younger in 757 by Tassilo III, Duke of Bavaria, involved the relics of Saints Denis, Rusticus, √âleuth√®re, Martin, and Germain ‚Äì apparently assembled at Compiegne for the event. Such refinements were not included from the outset when it was time of crisis, war, hunger, etc. Under feudalism, those who were weakest needed the protection of the knights who owned the weapons and knew how to fight. Feudal society was increasingly based on the concept of \\"lordship\\" (French seigneur), which was one of the distinguishing features of the Early Middle Ages and had evolved from times of Late Antiquity. In the time of Charlemagne (ruled 768‚Äì814), the connection slowly developed between vassalage and the grant of land, the main form of wealth at that time. Contemporaneous social developments included agricultural \\"manorialism\\" and the social and legal structures labelled ‚Äî but only since the 18th century ‚Äî \\"feudalism\\". These developments proceeded at different rates in various regions. In Merovingian times (5th century to 752), monarchs would reward only the greatest and most trusted vassals with lands. Even at the most extreme devolution of any remnants of central power, in 10th-century France, the majority of vassals still had no fixed estates. Ganshof, Fran√ßois Louis, Feudalism translated 1964 The stratification of a fighting band of vassals into distinct groups might roughly correlate with the new term \\"fief\\" that had started to supersede \\"benefice\\" in the 9th century. An \\"upper\\" group comprised great territorial magnates, who were strong enough to ensure the inheritance of their benefice to the heirs of their family. A \\"lower\\" group consisted of landless knights attached to a count or duke. This social settling process also received impetus in fundamental changes in the conduct of warfare. As co-ordinated cavalry superseded disorganized infantry, armies became more expensive to maintain. A vassal needed economic resources to equip the cavalry he was bound to contribute to his lord to fight his frequent wars. Such resources, in the absence of a money economy, came only from land and its associated assets, which included peasants as well as wood and water. Difference between \\"vassalage\\" and \\"vassal state\\" Many empires have set up vassal states, based on tribes, kingdoms, or city-states, the subjects of which they wish to control without having to conquer or directly govern them. In these cases a subordinate state (such as a dependency, suzerainty, residency or protectorate) has retained internal autonomy, but has lost independence in foreign policy, while also, in many instances, paying formal tribute, or providing troops when requested. In this framework, a formal colony or \\"junior ally\\" might also be regarded as a vassal state in terms of international relations, analogous to a domestic \\"fief-holder\\" or \\"trustee\\". The concept of a vassal state uses the concept of personal vassalry to theorize formally hegemonic relationships between states ‚Äì even those using non-personal forms of rule. Imperial states to which this terminology has been applied include, for instance: Ancient Rome, the Mongol Empire, Imperial China and the British Empire.  Feudal Japanese equivalents In Medieval Japan, the relations between the powerful daimy≈çs and shugo and the subordinate jizamurai bear some obvious resemblance to western vassalage, although there are also some significant differences.

He served as the programme's first story editor, supervising the writing of its first 51 episodes from 1963 to 1964. Career Prior to joining the BBC, Whitaker worked as a writer, actor and director with the York Repertory Group. A play he wrote for them, ‚ÄòA Choice of Partners‚Äô (1957), gained the attention of the BBC's script department. They commissioned Whitaker to work on the programmes Garry Halliday (1962) and the long-running Compact (1962). Whitaker also contributed his own scripts for a number of Doctor Who serials, including The Crusade (1965), The Power of the Daleks (1966),https://tv.avclub.com/a-lost-doctor-who-classic-regenerates-into- animated-for-1798189561 The Evil of the Daleks (1967), The Enemy of the World (1967-68) and The Wheel in Space (1968, from a story concept by Kit Pedler).https://www.radiotimes.com/news/2009-07-20/the-wheel-in-space/ Although he left the post of story editor in 1964 his final script for the show was The Ambassadors of Death (1970). He had not planned to stay longer than a year as Doctor Who's story editor, as he thought the serial might not be renewed. He had therefore agreed to take up a role working on another production. His other work included writing the Dalek comic strip for the weekly children's magazine TV Century 21, in addition to the stage play The Curse of the Daleks (1965). In 1964, Whitaker published the first novelisation of a Doctor Who serial; more than 150 other such books would be published in the course of the next 30 years. His own, Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks, was based on Terry Nation's script for the first Dalek TV serial. He completed a second novelisation the following year, this time based on his own script for The Crusade. Both books were originally published by Frederick Muller, with the first also being given a paperback release by Armada. In 1973, Whitaker's novelisations (along with a third, written by Bill Strutton and based on The Web Planet) were re-issued by Target Books as part of its launch of a new series of novelisations; Whitaker's Dalek story was re- titled Doctor Who and the Daleks. From 1966 to 1968 Whitaker was the chairman of the Writers Guild of Great Britain. He moved to Australia in the 70's and contributed to the series \\"Homicide\\", \\"The Drifter\\" and \\"Elephant Boy\\" before returning to the UK . Before his death in 1980, Whitaker had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He died leaving his novelisation of The Enemy of the World unfinished and his plans to adapt The Evil of the Daleks unrealised. The adaptation of The Enemy of the World was ultimately written by Ian Marter without using any of the material prepared by Whitaker, while The Evil of the Daleks was eventually novelised by John Peel and published in 1993.

The old hanseatic town Lemgo has a population of c. 41,000 (2017) and belongs to the OWL region, which is one of the most important cluster regions for mechanical engineering and industrial electronics in Germany. In 2017 the German Internet portal reisereporter.de placed Lemgo among the most beautiful ten half-timbered towns in Germany. Lemgo is situated between the Teutoburg Forest and the Weser Uplands. History It was founded in the 12th century by Bernard II, Lord of Lippe at the crossroad of two merchant routes. Lemgo was a member of the Hanseatic League, a medieval trading association of free or autonomous cities in several northern European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. During the Reformation the city of Lemgo adopted Lutheranism in 1522, whereas otherwise in Lippe, its spread was hampered until 1533 by the opposition of the then Catholic ruling Counts of Lippe. In 1605 Simon VI, Count of Lippe adopted Calvinism and demanded the conversion of Lemgo's citizens too using his monarchic privilege of cuius regio, eius religio. This led to a dispute with Lemgo. The city defied the edict to convert to Calvinism, leading to the Revolt of Lemgo. This religious dispute was resolved by the Peace of R√∂hrentrup in 1617, granting Lemgo the right to determine its faith independently. Lippe's Lutheran minority, mostly domiciled in Lemgo, only joined the else Reformed Church of Lippe in 1882, however, retaining its Confession of Augsburg with the Lutheran congregations forming a separate classis within the Lippe church since 1888. Lemgo downtown =British Army= From 1947 until 1993, Lemgo hosted successive infantry battalions of the British Army, the last one being the Royal Irish Regiment. The battalions were based in Stornoway Barracks, known to the locals as Spiegelberg Kaserne. The base was previously the location of a Displaced persons camp and before that a Wehrmacht artillery unit. At the end of World War II, Canadian Section GHQ, 2nd Echelon, HQ 21 Army Group, occupied Spiegelberg Kaserne. After this headquarters moved to Oldenburg the site was taken over by the British Army. Research and education Campus main building of the OWL University of Applied Sciences and Arts at Lemgo (2019) Lemgo is the location of the OWL University and the Fraunhofer Institute IOSB- INA. Together with the partners of the Centrum Industrial IT, a science-to- business center for Industrial Automation Technologies, and the Industry 4.0 Living Lab SmartFactoryOWL the campus site in Lemgo forms a cluster for Intelligent Systems Technologies in the OWL region. Building of the Research Center \\"Centrum Industrial IT (CIIT)\\" The Innovation Campus Lemgo is a district for the digital economy, which connects existing and new actors throughout the innovation chain education - research - economy. The campus forms one of the three regional centers in the technology network Intelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen-Lippe (it's OWL). There are more than 8,500 people on the campus on weekdays, including around 3,600 students, 4,100 pupils, 500 academic and 250 other employees. Digital transformation Beginning of 2018, Fraunhofer Institute in Lemgo and partners started the IoT Living Lab LemGO Digital as a reference platform for the digital transformation of small and medium sized towns.[https://lemgo- digital.de/index.php/en/ Web page of the Fraunhofer Living Lab, visited 19th of August, 2018 Transport The next international airports are Paderborn Lippstadt Airport 50 km to the south, Hannover Airport 70 km to the northeast, M√ºnster/Osnabr√ºck 85 km to the west and Dortmund Airport 105 km to the southwest. A railway connection is served every hour by the RB 73 The Lipperl√§nder to Bielefeld main station. With Lemgo-L√ºttfeld railway station the Innovation Campus Lemgo has its own station. The next motor highway is the Bundesautobahn 2 (A2), which runs only 9 kilometers west of Lemgo and can be used via the exit Ostwestfalen-Lippe/Lemgo. Culture Lemgo's historic centre survived the Second World War completely undestroyed. Thus, the overall urban character with the testimonies from the time of the Renaissance was preserved. =Museum= Until a few years ago, the Museum Hexenb√ºrgermeisterhaus displayed replicas of some torture instruments from the time of the witch hunt. An exhibition about the life and work of the artist Karl Junker can be seen in the Museum Junkerhaus. The \\"Junkerhaus\\" is a work of the artist from the year 1891, provided with numerous ornate carvings. The St√§dtische Galerie Haus Eichenm√ºller exhibits temporary exhibitions of works by contemporary artists. The oil mill is a functioning watermill with an attached mill museum. The Weser Renaissance Museum Schloss Brake shows examples of art, culture and life at the time of the Weser Renaissance. The documentation and meeting place Frenkelhaus shows a permanent exhibition on the history of the Jews in Lemgo. Lemgo - Schloss Brake 13. Jh. mit Steinbr√ºcke.jpgBrake Palace Lemgo Brake √ñlm√ºhle.jpgOil Mill Lemgo Museum Junkerhaus.jpgMuseum Junkerhaus =Historical buildings=  Hexenb√ºrgermeisterhaus  Hexenb√ºrgermeisterhaus The most famous house in Lemgo is the so-called Hexenb√ºrgermeisterhaus from 1571 with a facade in the style of Weser Renaissance. Its unusual name comes from its mayor Cothmann, who officiated in the 17th century, who, out of lust for power, used witchcraft as an integral part of the Christian faith to clear his political opponents out of the field. To make this clear, he had several dozen other citizens killed, both women and men. On the fa√ßade below there is a wide, richly-perforated zone of stems called 'Utluchten', a term also rarely used in specialist literature. The most typical examples were Renaissance stone buildings and half-timbered building from the 17th and 18th centuries. On the right part of the facade is a bay window on consoles. The facade above is divided by half-columns and cornices.  Town hall  Town Hall of Lemgo The town hall in the style of the Weser Renaissance, which was included in the UNESCO list of works of European renown, consists of parts built at different times. Such a genesis is not uncommon for large secular buildings such as town halls, because of the growing number of inhabitants and the increasing administrative activity of the cities, more and more premises were needed. Instead of new buildings, the neighboring houses were bought and extended the town hall. The oldest part is an elongated hall building dating back to the 13th century. The middle part of the building is built in Gothic [Gothic] style and dates from around 1480 to 1490. It houses the Council Chamber, including the Court Arbor. Such open ground floors belong mostly to medieval town halls, because there took place the public court hearings. Such open ground floors belong mostly to medieval town halls, because there took place the public court hearings. The most recent members of the Weser Renaissance are from the 15th and 16th centuries. The Apothecary's Corner is a showpiece with equally strict and playful language of form. Similarly in the execution is the council foliage with the Kornherrenstube upstairs on the north side of the town hall. The construction of the Neue Ratsstube is simpler and sums up the market fa√ßade of the building symmetrically with the Apothekererker.  Brake Castle  Castle Brake The Brake Castle is an important architectural monument, whose architectural history reaches from the 12th to the 19th century. The present state of the castle is the result of renovations and extensions. After 1190, Lord Bernhard II of Lippe had built a stone castle. Their dimensions were similar to those of today's castle. In 1306 \\"castrum brac\\" was first mentioned. It was the preferred seat of the noble lords (from 1528 counts) of Lippe. In 1587 it was extended as a residence of the counts of Lippe in the style of the renaissance. It is surrounded by a moat and stands on the foundation walls of one of the largest medieval castles in Northern Germany. The striking tower makes it the widely visible landmark of the old hanseatic town Lemgo. The buildings in the immediate vicinity of the castle still convey an impressive picture of an early-modern residence, which includes the domain, three historic mills and a wash house.  Other historical town houses  Old Bakery house, Echternstra√üe 92 In the historic city center a number of merchants' houses from late gothic and renaissance have survived. Here you will find half-timbered and stone houses with ornate gables, for example the \\"Neust√§dter Twins\\" and the former Adlerhof. Architectural research has shown that the houses Mittelstra√üe 54 and 56 (near the market square) have even more parts of the building from the 13th century on their back fronts and thus the rare case from the early Gothic period (Mittelstra√üe 54, dated to the second Half of the 13th century) or the late Romanesque art (house Mittelstra√üe 56, based on the arched windows dated to the first half of the 13th century) originate from prof cultivation. In Mittelstra√üe, which is the pedestrian zone designated shopping street in the historical city center, are the most important town houses of the city. In addition, there are hundreds of smaller half-timbered houses from the 15th to the 19th century, especially in the old town.

Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts ‚Äì and often pitched battles ‚Äì with both employers and governmental authorities. One of the most dramatic of these struggles occurred in the Cripple Creek district in 1903‚Äì04, and has been called the Colorado Labor Wars. The WFM also played a key role in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905, but left that organization several years later. The WFM changed its name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers (more familiarly referred to as Mine Mill) in 1916. After a period of decline it revived in the early days of the New Deal and helped found the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1935. The Mine Mill union was expelled from the CIO in 1950 during the post-war red scare for refusing to shed its Communist leadership. After spending years fighting off efforts by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) to raid its membership, Mine Mill and the Canadian Auto Workers merged in 1967 and were able to retain the name Mine Mill Local 598. Founding After hard rock miners made sporadic and often unsuccessful efforts to organize during previous decades, the Western Federation of Miners was established on May 15, 1893.John M. O'Neill, \\"Western Federation of Miners,\\" American Labor Union Journal,\\" vol. 1, no. 48 (Sept. 3, 1903), pg. 14. The federation was formed through the merger of several miners' unions representing copper miners from Butte, Montana, silver and lead miners from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, gold miners from Colorado and hard rock miners from South Dakota, and Utah at a five-day convention held in Butte, Montana. First president of the organization was John Gilligan and W.J. Weeks was the union's first secretary-treasurer. Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin have written, > The Western Federation of Miners was frontier unionism, the organization of > workers who had become \\"wage slaves\\" of mining corporations rather recently > acquired by back-east absentee ownership. They built their union when they > were not yet \\"broken in\\" to the discipline of business management. [The WFM] > had the militancy of the undisciplined recruits ... From the founding of the > Western Federation in 1893, its story for twelve years is that of a > continuous search for solidarity ...Thompson, Fred W. and Murfin, Patrick. > The IWW: Its First Seventy Years. Chicago: Industrial Workers of the World, > 1976, p. 9. The miners who formed the union had already experienced a number of hard- fought battles with mine owners and governmental authorities: in the Coeur d'Alene strike in February 1892, after company guards shot five strikers to death, the miners disarmed the guards and marched more than a hundred strikebreakers out of town. In response Governor N.B. Willey asked for federal troops to restore order; President Benjamin Harrison sent General John Schofield, who declared martial law, arrested 600 strikers and then held them in a stockade prison without the right to trial, bail or habeas corpus.Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pp. 50. Schofield then ordered local mine owners to discharge any union members they had rehired. During the confrontation, the Coeur d'Alene miners received considerable assistance from the Butte Miners' Union in Butte, Montana, who mortgaged their buildings to send aid.Michael P. Malone, William L. Lang, The Battle for Butte, 2006, page 77. There was a growing concern that local unions were vulnerable to the power of Mine Owners' Associations like the one in Coeur d'Alene. In May 1893, about forty delegates from northern hard rock mining camps met in Butte, and established the Western Federation of Miners, which sought to organize miners throughout the West.A History of American Labor, Joseph G. Rayback, 1966, page 233. History =Cripple Creek, Colorado strike of 1894= Violence occurred in later strikes as well. At Cripple Creek, Colorado, after mine owners increased the working day from eight hours to ten, miners dynamited mine buildings and equipment. The county sheriff hired thousands of armed deputies, and then lost control of them. This 1894 struggle was one of the few strikes in which a state militia was called out to protect striking miners from an armed group supporting mine owners. Further violence was averted by the owners' agreement to return to the eight- hour day and improve miners' pay to three dollars a day ‚Äì the standard that the union fought for across the west from that point forward. That success enabled the WFM to expand dramatically over the next decade, to the point where it had over two hundred locals in thirteen states. =Leadville, Colorado strike of 1896‚Äì97= However, a struggle against mine owners in Leadville served to radicalize WFM leadership. Representatives of the Cloud City Miners' Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the Western Federation of Miners, asked for a wage increase of fifty cents per day for all mine workers not already making three dollars per day.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 2. The union felt justified, for fifty cents a day had been cut from the miners' wages during the depression of 1893.Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 211. Negotiations broke down and 968 miners walked out. Mine owners, who had formed a Mine Owners' Association with a secret anti-union agreement,William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 2,31, and 97, in reference to the Report of the Joint Special Legislative Committee, 693. locked out another 1,332 mine workers.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, page 2. The owners hired labor spies to spy on the union, and additional spies to report on replacement workers.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 7‚Äì8. Just days after union leaders publicly warned against violence,William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 75,118. a violent incident occurred at the Coronado Mine.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 1‚Äì4. At least four union miners and one fireman were killed.William Philpott, The Lessons of Leadville, Colorado Historical Society, 1995, pages 4‚Äì5. Colorado Governor McIntire sent the Colorado National Guard to Leadville. =Short-lived alliance with the American Federation of Labor= The WFM affiliated with the American Federation of Labor in 1896, but WFM delegates came away from the AFL convention in Cincinnati, > ...not only disappointed with the refusal to aid their big fight in > Leadville, but with a feeling that they had not been associating with union > men, or with men possessing the moral or intellectual fibre ever to become > good union men.Thompson, Fred W. and Murfin, Patrick. The IWW: Its First > Seventy Years. Chicago: Industrial Workers of the World, 1976, p. 10. The WFM withdrew from the AFL the following year. With the support of other organizations, including the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana, which issued a proposition to organize a new federation, the WFM created its own alternative to the AFL, the Western Labor Union (WLU). The WLU was formed in 1898 at a convention in Salt Lake City. Its goal was organizing all workers in the West. =Coeur d'Alene, Idaho confrontation of 1899= Another confrontation in Coeur d'Alene was marked by violence. The profitable Bunker Hill Mining Company at Wardner, IdahoJ. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 111. fired seventeen workers believed to be union members. On April 29, 250 angry miners seized a train and rode it to a $250,000 mill at the Bunker Hill Mine in Wardner. The miners then set off three thousand pounds of dynamite in the mill.Roughneck‚ÄîThe Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, pages 53‚Äì54. At Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg's request, President William McKinley sent the military to indiscriminately round up 1,000 men and put them into bullpens.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 141. Emma Langdon, a union sympathizer, charged in a 1908 book that Governor Steunenberg deposited $35,000 into his bank account within a week after troops arrived in the Coeur d'Alene district, implying that there may have been a bribe from the mine operators.Labor's Greatest Conflicts, Emma F. Langdon, 1908, page 17. J. Anthony Lukas later confirmed the donation in his book Big Trouble, > In 1899, when the state needed money for the Coeur d'Alene prosecutions, the > Mine Owners' Association had come up with $32,000‚Äîabout a third of it from > Bunker Hill and Sullivan‚Äîhanding $25,000 over to Governor Steunenberg for > use at his discretion in the prosecution. Some of this money went to pay > [attorneys].J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, page 351. Idaho miners were held for \\"months of imprisonment in the 'bull-pen' ‚Äî a structure unfit to house cattle ‚Äì enclosed in a high barbed-wire fence.\\"The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William D. Haywood, 1929, page 81. Some of the miners, never having been charged with any crime, were eventually allowed to go free, while others were prosecuted. Hundreds more remained in the makeshift prison without charges.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 149‚Äì150. The Coeur d'Alene mine owners developed a permit-based hiring system to exclude union miners.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 146‚Äì148. =Growing radicalism= At their 1901 convention the WFM miners agreed to the proclamation that a \\"complete revolution of social and economic conditions\\" was \\"the only salvation of the working classes.\\"All That Glitters‚ÄîClass, Conflict, and Community in Cripple Creek, Elizabeth Jameson, 1998, page 179. WFM leaders openly called for the abolition of the wage system. By the spring of 1903 the WFM was the most militant labor organization in the country.Colorado's War on Militant Unionism, James H. Peabody and the Western Federation of Miners, George G. Suggs, Jr., 1972, page 15. =Colorado strikes of 1903‚Äì04= The plan to organize the mill workers led to even fiercer battles with the refinery companies, who paid their workers half what miners earned for a ten- to twelve-hour day. When smelter workers went on strike in Colorado City, Colorado in 1903 it appeared that they might be able to win their demands without a serious fight, since the Cripple Creek miners were striking in sympathy with their demands. However, when one of the smelter operators refused to accept the deal brokered by the Governor of Colorado, James Hamilton Peabody, the Governor called in federal troops. Peabody was a fierce opponent of unions and of any social legislation that limited businesses' right to run their own affairs as they saw fit. The crucial issue in Colorado was the eight-hour day. When the Legislature had enacted a statute limiting the workday in hazardous industries, such as mining and smelting, to eight hours, the Colorado Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional. The voters of Colorado then passed a referendum authorizing the eight-hour day, but the smelter owners and Republican Party fought any efforts to pass a new statute implementing the amendment. That power took the form of Colorado's National Guard, whose salaries were paid by the business community, not the State. Their commanding officer, General Sherman Bell, began arresting union leaders, strikers, and local public officials by the hundreds. Bell prohibited local newspapers from printing any material unfavorable to the military and ordered the arrest of the entire staff of a newspaper whose editorial had offended him. In Bell's words, \\"Military necessity recognizes no laws, either civil or social\\". When a lawyer for the union sought to free the prisoners on a writ of habeas corpus, Bell responded, \\"Habeas corpus, be damned! We'll give 'em post mortems!\\"Roughneck‚ÄîThe Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 62. The violence intensified. After a mine explosion on November 21, 1903 killed a superintendent and foreman, Bell announced a vagrancy order that required all strikers to return to work or be deported from the district. When a bomb exploded at the Independence Depot near Victor, Colorado on June 6, 1904, killing thirteen strikebreakers, Sheriff H.M. Robertson went to investigate. The situation became very volatile, with throngs of angry men gathered in the streets. The Cripple Creek Mine Owners' Association and an anti-union vigilante organization, the Cripple Creek District Citizens' Alliance, called a meeting at the Victor Military Club to formulate a response to the violence. A short time later Sheriff Robertson, whom the Mine Owner's Association deemed too tolerant of the union, was confronted and ordered to resign immediately or be lynched. Robertson was replaced with Edward Bell, a member of both the Mine Owner's Association and the Citizens' Alliance. In a hostile environment ripe for provocation, the Mine Owner's Association and the Citizens' Alliance called a public meeting in a vacant lot across from the Western Federation of Miners union hall in Victor. Speeches against the union gave way to arguments, followed by fist fights and shooting. Two non-union men were killed and five others on both sides were wounded in the melee. WFM members took refuge in their hall, but Company L of the National Guard surrounded the hall and laid siege, firing into the building from nearby rooftops. Forty union members eventually surrendered, with four of them sporting fresh wounds. The Citizen's Alliance entered the building and trashed it. Vigilantes subsequently destroyed every union hall in the area, while General Bell used the National Guard to deport hundreds of strikers. General Bell closed the Portland Mine, owned by James Burns, because it had come to an agreement with the WFM. =Aftermath of the strikes= Although the courts eventually acquitted all union members charged with the bombing of the railroad station during the 1903‚Äì04 strike and awarded damages to those who had been deported, the strike and the union were broken in Cripple Creek; similar measures were resorted to in Telluride, Colorado. The actions effectively drove the WFM out of many of the mining camps in Colorado. =Bingham strike, 1912= On 18 September 1912, about 4,800 miners struck Utah Copper Company \\"and all the principal mines, mills, and smelters of Bingham camp.\\" Other Utah mine sympathizers brought that number to 9,000. The company enlisted an army of 5,000 besides having the protection of the Utah National Guard. The strike ended in October and at the end of the month, Daniel C. Jackling raised wages. It also saw an end to the Padrone system. =Michigan copper strike, 1913‚Äì1914= In July 1913, locals of the Western Federation of Miners called a general strike against all mines in the Michigan Copper Country. The strike was called without approval by the national WFM, which was extremely low on funds after the recent strikes in the west. The union supported the strike, but faced great difficulties providing pay and supplies to the strikers. Hundreds of strikers surrounded the mine shafts to prevent others from reporting to work. Almost all mines shut down, although the workers were said to be sharply divided on the strike question. The union demanded an 8-hour day, a minimum wage of $3 per day, an end to use of the one-man drill, and that the companies recognize it as the employees' representative.\\"The Copper Country Strike.\\" Engineering & Mining Journal. August 2, 1913, p. 230. The mines reopened under National Guard protection, and many went back to work. The companies instituted the 8-hour day, but refused to set a $3 per day minimum wage, refused to abandon the one-man drill, and especially refused to employ Western Federation of Miners members.\\"Lake Superior Wages.\\" Engineering & Mining Journal. December 13, 1913, p. 1136. On Christmas Eve 1913, the Western Federation of Miners organized a party for strikers and their families at the Italian Benevolent Society hall in Calumet. The hall was packed with between 400 and 500 people when someone shouted \\"fire.\\" There was no fire, but 73 people, 62 of them children, were crushed to death trying to escape. This became known as the Italian Hall Disaster. Shortly after the disaster, WFM president Charles Moyer was shot and then forcibly placed on a train headed for Chicago. The strikers held out until April 1914, but then gave up the strike. The WFM was left with almost no funds to run its operations or future strikes. =WFM Loses Butte, Montana= In 1914, the copper miners at Butte, Montana, split between those loyal to the WFM, and those supporting more militancy, many of whom sympathized with the more radical Industrial Workers of the World. The militants attacked WFM officials marching in the annual Union Day parade, and later blew up the WFM headquarters with dynamite. The dissidents established their own rival union, but neither the WFM or the new militant union was able to keep peace among the miners, so the mine owners recognized neither union. The result was that at Butte, for many years a WFM stronghold, the mine owners did not recognize any miners union from 1914 until 1934. Founding the IWW The WFM's defeat led it to look for allies in the battle with employers in the Rockies, a struggle the union didn't want to concede. The Western Labor Union had renamed itself the American Labor Union in 1902. The WFM now sought to join with other advocates of industrial unionism and socialism to found a national union federation, the Industrial Workers of the World, in 1905. The WFM had adopted a socialist program in 1901. \\"Big Bill\\" Haywood, who joined the union as a silver miner in Idaho, put the union's anti-capitalist stance in the simplest terms: he took the side of workers against the mine owners who \\"did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them!\\"Haywood, William D. The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood. New York: International Publishers, 1929, p. 171. Haywood was the first chairman of the IWW; he defined its work as \\"socialism with its working clothes on\\". But factional differences the following year between the \\"revolutionists\\" and \\"reformists\\" within the IWW, which also divided the leadership of the WFM, led to the departure of the WFM from the IWW in 1907. After the split, former WFM leaders Bill Haywood and Vincent St. John left the WFM to work for the IWW. The WFM rejoined the AFL in 1911. Trial of Haywood, Pettibone and Moyer When Frank Steunenberg, a former governor of Idaho, was murdered on December 30, 1905, the authorities arrested Charles Moyer, president of the union, Bill Haywood, its secretary, and George Pettibone, a former member, in Colorado and put them on trial for Steunenberg's murder. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Harry Orchard, who claimed that the union had directed him to plant the bombs that killed supervisors and strikebreakers during the second Cripple Creek strike and that Haywood, Moyer and Pettibone had hired him to assassinate Governor Steunenberg. The prosecution had depended heavily on the investigative work of James McParland who, acting as an operative for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, had helped convict the Molly Maguires three decades earlier, and felt confident that it would convict all three. McParland persuaded Orchard that he could avoid the gallows if he testified that an \\"inner circle\\" of Western Federation of Miners leaders had ordered the crime. The prosecution of that \\"inner circle\\" of the union was then funded, in part, by direct contributions from the Ceour d'Alene District Mine Owners' Association to prosecuting attorneys who were, ostensibly, working for the state rather than for private interests.J. Anthony Lukas, Big Trouble, 1997, pages 353‚Äì357. Upon hearing of this circumstance, president Theodore Roosevelt issued a particularly stern rebuke to Idaho Governor Frank Gooding, describing such a state of affairs as the \\"grossest impropriety\\": > If the Governor or the other officials of Idaho accept a cent from the > operators or from any other capitalist with any reference, direct or > indirect, to this prosecution, they would forfeit the respect of every good > citizen and I should personally feel that they had committed a real > crime.Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, page 369. Roosevelt's strong words came in spite of the fact that he had already concluded the WFM leaders were guilty.Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, page 387. Governor Gooding's response to the President provided a severely distorted account of the financial arrangements for the trial, and a promise to return money contributed by the mine owners. Gooding then: > ...kept the narrowest construction of his promise to the president... [He > then proclaimed publicly and often that] no dollar has been or will be > supplied from any private source or organization whatsoever, [and then] went > right on taking money from the mine owners.Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, > 1997, pages 370‚Äì372. In addition to Idaho mine owners, powerful and wealthy industrialists outside of Idaho were also tapped in an effort to destroy the Western Federation of Miners. Donations for the prosecutorial effort estimated in the range of $75,000 to $100,000 were simultaneously solicited and forwarded from the Colorado Mine Owners' Association and other wealthy Colorado donors.Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, pages 370‚Äì378. Mining interests in other states ‚Äì Nevada and Utah, for example ‚Äì were approached as well.Big Trouble, J. Anthony Lukas, 1997, page 379. The defense hired Clarence Darrow, the most renowned lawyer of the day, who had represented Eugene V. Debs several years earlier. In spite of the combined efforts of state and local governments in Idaho and Colorado, the Mine Owners' Associations, the Pinkerton and Thiel Detective Agencies, and other interested industrialists, the jury acquitted Bill Haywood. Pettibone was also acquitted early the next year, and all charges against Moyer were dropped.The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 224 ppbk. In a separate prosecution, Orchard was convicted and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted, and he spent the rest of his life in an Idaho prison. Orchard died in prison in 1954. Mine Mill The failure of later strikes and the depression of 1914 brought about a sharp decline in the WFM's membership. In 1916 the union changed its name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. The union had become largely ineffective, riddled with members who passed information on to their employers, and unable to win substantial gains for its members for most of the next two decades. Things changed, however, in 1934 when miners and smeltermen revitalized the union. Returning to its militant roots, the union spread throughout the west from its base in Butte, and then into the South and Canada. There were also union locals in non- ferrous smelters in New Jersey ‚Äì in Perth Amboy at the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), and in Carteret at the U.S. Metals Company. The union was one of the original members of the Committee for Industrial Organizing, which later transformed itself into the Congress of Industrial Organizations. The union also returned to its radical political traditions, as members of the Communist Party USA came to hold the presidency of the union in the late 1940s. That, however, sparked further disagreements over leadership and expenditures and, as the postwar red scare picked up momentum, prompted raids by the United Steelworkers of America, the United Auto Workers and other unions, particularly in mining in the South, where the CIO encouraged predominantly white miners' locals to defect. The CIO formally expelled the union in 1950 after it refused to remove its communist leaders. The union soldiered on for another seventeen years, finding itself increasingly outmatched in its battles with employers. While it defeated all of the Steelworkers' efforts to replace it in its western strongholds in the 1950s, it had a harder time holding on to its outposts in the South. In addition, more conservative members, uneasy with the union's foreign policy and with the increasing number of African-American and Mexican-American unionists, tried to take their locals out of the union, opening up fissures that weakened the union's strikes against the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1954 and 1959. The union eventually merged with the Steelworkers in 1967 after losing locals to it in Butte and Canada. Only Local 598 in Sudbury, Ontario, which had a contentious and sometimes violent history with the city's Steelworkers locals,\\"Fighting the good fight: Homer Seguin tells his story\\" , Northern Life, October 15, 2008. northernlife.ca voted against the merger ‚Äì it remained autonomous until 1993, when it merged with the Canadian Auto Workers. Salt of the Earth The 1954 movie Salt of the Earth, directed by Herbert J. Biberman, a member of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, portrays a year-and-a- half long strike by New Mexico zinc miners who belonged to Mine Mill; many of the actors were rank-and-file members of that union. The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union wanted nothing to do with it, while those who sympathized did not want to be seen switching sides, even as actors. The movie's star, Rosaura Revueltas, was deported during the shooting of the film, requiring the producers to use a double in some scenes and to shoot film of others and record her narration in Mexico. The home of one of the union members/actors and the union hall were burned down shortly after the end of shooting. Clinton Jencks, the Mine Mill organizer depicted in the film, was thereafter convicted of falsely stating he was not a communist on the affidavit required of all union representatives under the Taft-Hartley Act; his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in Jencks v. United States, 353 U.S. 657 (1957). The producers were unable to find a post-production house in Hollywood willing to process the film or skilled editors willing to work on it, other than under pseudonyms or at night. The film was shown at only a few theaters; most theaters rejected it, including some that had originally agreed to show it. Union projectionists refused to show it at some theaters that had accepted it. The struggle to produce the film, pictures and information about the original strike, along with the film itself in its entirety, is available on DVD from www.Organa.com.

The war ended when the United States Senate ratified Commodore Stephen Decatur‚Äôs Algerian treaty on December 5, 1815. However, Dey Omar Agha of Algeria repudiated the US treaty, refused to accept the terms of peace that had been ratified by the Congress of Vienna, and threatened the lives of all Christian inhabitants of Algiers. William Shaler was the US commissioner in Algiers who had negotiated alongside Decatur, but he fled aboard British vessels during the Bombardment of Algiers (1816). He negotiated a new treaty in 1816 which was not ratified by the Senate until February 11, 1822, because of an oversight. After the end of the war, the United States and European nations stopped paying tribute to the pirate states; this marked the beginning of the end of piracy in that region, which had been rampant in the days of Ottoman domination during the 16th‚Äì18th centuries. The western nations built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships which the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology. Background The First Barbary War (1801‚Äì05) had led to an uneasy truce between the US and the Barbary states, but American attention turned to Britain and the War of 1812. At the prompting of Britain, the Barbary pirates returned to their practice of attacking American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea and ransoming their crews to the United States government. At the same time, the major European powers were still involved in the Napoleonic Wars, which did not fully end until 1815.Gregory Fremont-Barnes, The Wars of the Barbary Pirates (London: Osprey, 2006) online At the conclusion of the War of 1812, however, the United States returned to the problem of Barbary piracy. On 3 March 1815, Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, and the squadron under the command of Commodore Stephen Decatur set sail on 20 May. It consisted of (flagship), , Macedonia, , , , , Flambeau, , and . Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur's squadron encountered the Algerian flagship Meshuda and captured it in the Battle off Cape Gata, and they captured the Algerian brig Estedio in the Battle off Cape Palos. By the final week of June, the squadron had reached Algiers and had initiated negotiations with the Dey. The United States made persistent demands for compensation, mingled with threats of destruction, and the Dey capitulated. He signed a treaty aboard the Guerriere in the Bay of Algiers on 3 July 1815, in which Decatur agreed to return the captured Meshuda and Estedio. The Algerians returned all American captives, estimated to be about 10, in exchange for about 500 subjects of the Dey.\\"the United States according to the usages of civilized nations requiring no ransom for the excess of prisoners in their favor.\\" (Article 3) Algeria also paid $10,000 for seized shipping. The treaty guaranteed no further tributes by the United States\\"It is distinctly understood between the Contracting parties, that no tribute either as biennial presents or under any other form or name whatever shall ever be required by the Dey and Regency of Algiers from the United States of America on any pretext whatever.\\" (Article 2) and granted the United States full shipping rights in the Mediterranean Sea. Aftermath In early 1816, Britain undertook a diplomatic mission, backed by a small squadron of ships of the line, to Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers to convince the Deys to stop their piracy and free enslaved European Christians. The Beys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was less cooperative, and the negotiations were stormy. The leader of the diplomatic mission, Edward Pellew, 1st Viscount Exmouth, believed that he had negotiated a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, just after the treaty was signed, Algerian troops massacred 200 Corsican, Sicilian and Sardinian fishermen who had been under British protection thanks to the negotiation. This caused outrage in Britain and Europe, and Exmouth's negotiations were seen as a failure. As a result, Exmouth was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five ships of the line, reinforced by a number of frigates, later reinforced by a flotilla of six Dutch ships. On 27 August 1816, following a round of failed negotiations, the fleet delivered a punishing nine-hour bombardment of Algiers. The attack immobilized many of the Dey's corsairs and shore batteries, forcing him to accept a peace offer of the same terms that he had rejected the day before. Exmouth warned that if the terms were not accepted, he would continue the action. The Dey accepted the terms, but Exmouth had been bluffing since his fleet had already spent all its ammunition. A treaty was signed on 24 September 1816. The British Consul and 1,083 other Christian slaves were freed, and the U.S. ransom money repaid.Fremont-Barnes, pp 84-85. After the First Barbary War, the European nations had been engaged in warfare with one another and the U.S. with the British. However, in the years immediately following the Second Barbary War, there was no general European war, which allowed the Europeans to build up their resources and challenge Barbary power in the Mediterranean without distraction. Algiers and Tunis were seized and colonized by France in 1830 and 1881, respectively.

This differentiates it from experimental research in which a quasi-artificial environment is created to control for spurious factors, and where at least one of the variables is manipulated as part of the experilovement. In context Observational research is a method of data collection that has become associated with qualitative research. Richie, J and Lewis, J., Qualitative Research Practice: A Guide for Social Science Students and Researchers, Thousand Oaks, CA, Sage Publications, 2003, p. 3 Compared with quantitative research and experimental research, observational research tends to be less reliable but often more valid. The main advantage of observational research is flexibility. The researchers can change their approach as needed. Observational research measures behavior directly, rather than the subject's self-reports of behavior or intentions. The main disadvantage is it is limited to behavioral variables. It cannot be used to study cognitive or affective variables. Data collection methods Generally, there are three methods used to collect data in observational research:Kazdin, Alan (2002), Research Design in Clinical Psychology, 4th ed., Needham Heights, MA, Allyn & Bacon. Chapter 9 *Covert observational research ‚Äì The researchers do not identify themselves. Either they mix in with the subjects undetected, or they observe from a distance. The advantages of this approach are: (1) It is not necessary to get the subjects' cooperation, and (2) The subjects' behaviour will not be contaminated by the presence of the researcher. Some researchers have ethical misgivings with the deceit involved in this approach.Grove, S.J. and Fisk, R.P., \\"Observational data collection methods for services marketing: an overview,\\" Journal of the Academy of Marketing Science, Vol. 20, No. 3, 1992, p. 219 *Overt observational research ‚Äì The researchers identify themselves as researchers and explain the purpose of their observations. The problem with this approach is subjects may modify their behaviour when they know they are being watched. They portray their \\"ideal self\\" rather than their true self in what is called the Hawthorne Effect. The advantage that the overt approach has over the covert approach is that there is no deception (see, for example, PCIA- IIHoligrocki, R. J., & Kaminski, P.

The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927. \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin as the last song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics and the songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin. Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song. Background and lyrics When blues musical duo Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie wrote \\"When the Levee Breaks\\", the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was still fresh in people's memories. The flooding affected 26,000 square miles of the Mississippi Deltahundreds were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate. The event is the subject of several blues songs, the most popular being \\"Backwater Blues\\" by Bessie Smith (1927) and \\"Mississippi Heavy Water Blues\\" by Barbecue Bob (1928). Ethel Douglas, Minnie's sister-in-law, recalled that Minnie was living with her family near Walls, Mississippi, when the levee broke in 1927. The song's lyrics recount the personal toll on a man who lost his home and family. Despite the tragedy, biographers also see in it a statement of rebirth. Recording and release McCoy and Minnie recorded \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" during their first session for Columbia Records in New York City on June 18, 1929. The song features McCoy on vocals and rhythm guitar. Minnie, the more accomplished guitarist of the two, provided the embellishments using a finger picked-style in a Spanish or open G tuning. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray identifies Joe McCoy as the actual songwriter. However, as with all their Columbia releases, regardless of who sang the song, the record labels list the artist as \\"Kansas Joe and Memphis Minnie\\". Columbia issued the song on the then-standard 78 rpm phonograph record, with \\"That Will Be Alright\\", another vocal performance by McCoy, on the flip-side in August or June 1929. The record was released before record industry publications, such as Billboard began tracking so-called race records, but it has been called a moderate hit. \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" is included on several Memphis Minnie compilation albums and blues roots albums featuring various artists. Led Zeppelin version Led Zeppelin recorded \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" for their untitled fourth album. When considering material for the group to record, singer Robert Plant suggested the Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie song. Jimmy Page commented that while Plant's lyrics identified with the original, he developed a new guitar riff that set it apart. However, it is John Bonham's drumming that is usually noted as the defining characteristic of the song. =Recording= Before the released version, Led Zeppelin attempted the song twice. They recorded an early version of the song in December 1970 at Headley Grange, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. It was later released as \\"If It Keeps On Raining\\" on the 2015 reissue of Coda. Prior to relocating to Headley Grange, they tried unsuccessfully to record it at Island Studios at the beginning of the recording sessions for their fourth album. Page and John Paul Jones based their guitar and bass lines on the original song. However, they did not follow its twelve-bar blues I‚ÄìIV‚ÄìV‚ÄìI structure, but instead used a one-chord or modal approach to give it a droning sound. Plant used many of the lyrics, but took a different melodic approach. He also added a harmonica part; during mixing, a reverse echo effect was created, whereby the echo is heard ahead of the source. John Bonham's drumming, played on a Ludwig kit, was recorded in the lobby of Headley Grange using two Beyerdynamic M 160 microphones which were hung up a flight of stairs; output from these were passed to a pair of Helios F760 compressor/limiters. A Binson Echorec, a delay effects unit, was also used. Portions of the song were recorded at a different tempo, then slowed down, explaining the \\"sludgy\\" sound, particularly on the harmonica and guitar solos. It was the only song on the album that was mixed at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California (the rest being remixed in London). Page identifies the panning on the song's ending as one of his favourite mixes \\"when everything starts moving around except for the voice, which remains stationary.\\" The song was difficult to recreate live; the band only played it a few times in the early stages of their 1975 U.S. Tour. =Critical reception= Music critic Robert Christgau cited Led Zeppelin's version of \\"When the Levee Breaks\\" as their fourth album's greatest achievement. He argued that, because it plays like an authentic blues song and \\"has the grandeur of a symphonic crescendo\\", their version both transcends and dignifies \\"the quasi-parodic overstatement and oddly cerebral mood of\\" their past blues songs. Mick Wall called it a \\"hypnotic, blues rock mantra.\\" AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in a retrospective review, commented that the song was the only piece on their fourth album on par with \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and called it \\"an apocalyptic slice of urban blues ... as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.\\" In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Greg Kot wrote that the song showed the band's \\"hard-rock blues\\" at their most \\"momentous\\". However, group biographer Keith Shadwick notes the song \\"suffers from too few ideas added to the ingredients as the minutes tick by, compared with 'Black Dog'\\" and other songs on the first side of the album. =Other releases= A different version of the song can be found on the second disc of the remastered two-disc deluxe edition of Led Zeppelin IV, released in 2014. This version, known as \\"When The Levee Breaks (Alternate UK Mix in Progress)\\", was recorded on May 19, 1971, at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Headley Grange. This mix runs 7:09, while the original runs 7:08. A third version is included on 2015 deluxe edition of the album Coda, titled \\"If It Keeps on Raining (When the Levee Breaks) (Rough Mix)\\". =Sampling= Bonham's drum beat is one of the most widely sampled in popular music. According to Esquire magazine's Miles Raymer: Artists who have sampled the drum beat include Beastie Boys on \\"Rhymin & Stealin\\" (Licensed to Ill, 1986); Coldcut on \\"Beats + Pieces\\" (What's That Noise?, 1989); Dr. Dre on \\"Lyrical Gangbang\\" (The Chronic, 1992); MC Lyte on \\"Survival of the Fittest\\" (Eyes on This, 1989); Bj√∂rk on \\"Army of Me (Post, 1995)\\"; Eminem on \\"Kim\\" (The Marshall Mathers LP, 2000); Massive Attack on \\"Man Next Door\\" (Mezzanine, 1998); and Beyonc√© on \\"Don't Hurt Yourself\\" (Lemonade, 2016).

Advocates of industrial unionism value its contributions to building unity and solidarity, many suggesting the slogans, \\"an injury to one is an injury to all\\" and \\"the longer the picket line, the shorter the strike.\\" Industrial unionism contrasts with craft unionism, which organizes workers along lines of their specific trades, i.e., workers using the same kind of tools, or doing the same kind of work with approximately the same level of skill, even if this leads to multiple union locals (with different contracts, and different expiration dates) in the same workplace. Perceived disadvantages of craft unionism In 1922, Marion Dutton Savage cataloged the disadvantages of craft unionism, as observed by industrial union advocates. These included \\"distressingly frequent disputes between different craft unions\\" over jurisdiction; modern industry results in a constant process of phasing out old skills; one trade doing the struck work of another entity is a frequent dilemma; expiration of contracts can be staggered, hindering coordination of strikes. Industrial unionists observe that craft union members are more often required by their contracts to cross the picket lines established by workers in other unions. Likewise, in a strike of (for example) coal miners, unionized railroad workers may be required by their contracts to haul \\"scab\\" coal. Employers find it easier to enforce one bad contract, then use that as a precedent. Employers could also show favoritism to a strategic group of workers. Employers also find it easier to outsource the struck work of a craft union. A craft union with critical skills may be able to shut down an entire industry. The disadvantage is the harsh feelings of those who may be forced out of work by such an action, yet receive none of the bargained-for benefits. Arguments for industrial unionism Savage observed that industrial unionists criticized craft unionism not only for the ineffectiveness in dealing with a single employer, but also against larger corporate conglomerates. A union that challenges such a combination is most effective if its own structure reflects that of the company. Industrial unions likewise do not normally assess prohibitive dues rates common with craft unions, which serve to keep out many workers. Thus, the entire group of workers finds solidarity more elusive. Spirit and philosophy of industrial unionism A cartoon from the September, 1919 IWW periodical One Big Union, published in Revolutionary Radicalism (a government publication), shows a worker swimming through shark-infested waters. The shark is labeled capitalism, the boat is industrial unionism, the life buoy is IWW, and the harpoon is direct action. The concept of industrial unionism is important, not only to organized workers but also to the general public, because the philosophy and spirit of this organizing principle go well beyond the mere structure of a union organization. According to Marian Dutton Savage, who wrote about industrial unionism in America in 1922, > It is this difference in spirit and general outlook which is the significant > thing about industrial unionism. Including as it does all types of workers, > from the common laborer to the most highly skilled craftsman, the industrial > union is based on the conception of the solidarity of labor, or at least of > that portion of it which is in one particular industry. Instead of > emphasizing the divisions among the workers and fostering a narrow interest > in the affairs of the craft regardless of those of the industry as a whole, > it lays stress on the mutual dependence of the skilled and the unskilled and > the necessity of subordinating the interests of a small group to those of > the whole body of workers. Not only is loyalty to fellow-workers in the same > industry emphasized, but also loyalty to the whole working class in its > struggle against the capitalist system. Savage noted that some industrial unions of the period had \\"little of this class consciousness, [however] the majority of them are distinctly hoping for the abolition of the capitalist system and the ultimate control of industry by the workers themselves.\\" The conception of how this was to be brought about, and indeed even the extent to which such ideas were present in an industrial union, was quite variable from one union to another, as well as from one country to another, and from one time to another. In the United States, the conception of industrial unionism in the 1920s certainly differed from that of the 1930s, for example. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) primarily practiced a form of industrial unionism prior to its 1955 merger with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which was mostly craft unions. Unions in the resulting federation, the AFL-CIO, sometimes have a mixture of tendencies. The most basic philosophy of the union movement observes that an individual cannot stand alone against the power of the company, for the employment contract confers advantage to the employer. Having come to that understanding, the next question becomes: who is to be included in the union? * The craft unionist advocates sorting workers into exclusive groups of skilled workers, or workers sharing a particular trade. The organization operates, and the rules are formulated primarily to benefit members of that particular group. * Savage identified a skilled group that may not be craft based, but is nonetheless an elite group among industrial unionists. They are in essence craft groups which have been combined to solve \\"jurisdictional difficulties\\". Savage called this group an industrial union tendency rather than an example, made up of the \\"upper stratum of skilled trades,\\" and describes them as retaining some autonomy within their particular trades. * The industrial unionist sees advantage in organizing by industry. The local organization is broader and deeper, with less opportunity for employers to turn one group of workers against another. These are the \\"middle stratum\\" of workers. * Industrial unionists motivated by a more global impulse act upon a universal premise, that all workers must support each other no matter their particular industry or locale. These might be unskilled or migratory workers who conceive of their union philosophy as one big union. In 1922 these workers were described as \\"believing in assault rather than in agreements with employers, and having little faith in political action. [The one big union's] power is spectacular rather than continuous, as its members have little experience in organization.\\" The differences illustrated by these diverse approaches to organizing touch upon a number of philosophical issues: * Should all working people be free‚Äîand perhaps even obliged‚Äîto support each other's struggles? * What is the purpose of the union itself‚Äîis it to get a better deal for a small group of workers today, or to fight for a better environment for all working people in the future? (Or both... ? ) But some philosophical issues transcend the current social order: * Should the union acknowledge that capital has priority‚Äîthat is, that employers should be allowed to make all essential decisions about running the business, limiting the union to bargaining over wages, hours, and conditions? Or should the union fight for the principle that working people create wealth, and are therefore entitled to access to that wealth? * What is the impact of legislation designed specifically to curtail union tactics? Considering that unions have sometimes won rights by defying unjust laws, what should be the attitude of unionists toward that legislation? And finally, how does the interaction between aggressive unionization, and government response, play out? In short, these are questions of whether workers should organize as a craft, by their industry, or as a class. The implications of these last conjectures are considerable. When a group of workers becomes conscious of some connection to all other workers, such realization may animate a desire not just for better wages, hours, and working conditions, but rather, to change the system that limits or withholds such benefits. Paul Frederick Brissenden acknowledged as much in his 1919 publication The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism. Brissenden described revolutionary industrial unionism as industrial unionism \\"animated and guided by the revolutionary (socialist or anarchist) spirit...\\" Brissenden wrote that both industrial unionism and revolutionary industrial unionism \\"hark back in their essential principles to [a] dramatic revolutionary period in English unionism...\\" of roughly the late 1820s, the 1830s and the 1840s. He traced both the industrial and the revolutionary impulses through various union movements ever since. From the Knights of Labor to the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO), with all of the industrial unions and federations in between, the nature of union organization has been in contention for a very long time, and the philosophies of industrial unionism are inter-related. The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was inspired by the industrial unionism example of the American Railway Union (ARU). Labor Historian Melvyn Dubofsky traces the birth of the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) to the industrial unionism of the Western Federation of Miners, and their years under fire during the Colorado Labor Wars. And James P. Cannon has observed that \\"the CIO became possible only after and because the IWW had championed and popularized the program of industrial unionism in word and deed.\\" As we shall see below, unionism that dares to be powerful invites burgeoning challenges from other powerful interests. History of industrial unionism Organizational philosophies for the labor movement grow out of observation and experimentation. Success and failure combine with the aspirations and needs of working people and, in many cases, with the role of government to determine which union concepts will flourish, and which will be abandoned. =Mass organization displaced= Terence Powderly, Grand Master Workman of the Knights of Labor The Knights of Labor (KOL) was a mass organization, embracing nearly any worker who wanted to join. An early advocate of producerism, the KOL was so loosely organized that it admitted physicians and employers.. The question of admitting physicians is disputed‚Äîfor example, \\"no... doctor... could be admitted\\", . The evolution and competition of labor organizations is quite complex, and there are many factors beyond philosophy or specific organizational structure that determine success or failure. The KOL's policies on a number of issues seemed more progressive than those of the AFL‚Äîorganizing unskilled workers, educating against discrimination, and a dedication to broad idealism. The KOL subordinated separate craft interests to the welfare of all the workers. The KOL had an enormous membership compared to the early AFL. The KOL primarily consisted of previously unorganized semi-skilled workmen and machine operators. During 1886 KOL membership grew from 15,000 members to 700,000. But the AFL seemed more in touch with some of the goals of working people. The KOL began to falter when its leadership appeared to be out of touch with those goals. For example, the AFL supported the eight-hour day. Although the Knights supported the concept in their constitution, they failed to provide a plan for its implementation. Perhaps in part because employers were accepted into the KOL, leadership of the Knights considered a shorter workday impractical. The KOL leadership tried fruitlessly to discourage members from supporting the eight-hour movement that was embraced by the AFL. In its declining years, the remaining KOL membership was primarily rural and middle class. =Ascendance of a craft union federation= The American Federation of Labor (AFL) under the leadership of Samuel Gompers focused on \\"pure and simple\\" trade unionism. The AFL concerned itself with a \\"philosophy of pure wage consciousness\\", according to Selig Perlman, who developed the \\"business unionism\\" theory of labor. Perlman saw craft organizing as a means of resisting the encroachment of waves of immigrants. Organization that was based upon craft skills granted control over access to the job. In a sense, craft unions provided a good defense for the privileges of membership, but the offensive power of craft unions to effect change in society at large has been circumscribed by a self- limiting vision. The AFL was businesslike and pragmatic, adopting the motto, \\"A fair day's wage for a fair day's work.\\" The early rationale for craft unionism was that solidarity among diverse workers seemed difficult to obtain, while the AFL believed that skilled workers could more easily get improved conditions for themselves. Thus, craft unions have been criticized as a labor elite. Many Black workers never had the opportunity to learn a skill, and most AFL unions did not organize unskilled workers. Not only did many AFL unions exclude Black workers or relegate them into separate organizations, different groups of Asian immigrants had been excluded for decades. In May 1905 the Asiatic Exclusion League was organized to propagandize against Asian immigration, with many unions participating. Samuel Gompers, head of the American Federation of Labor The AFL frequently enforced its agenda upon its member unions with an imposed exclusivity. For example, the United Brewery Workmen (UBW) was affiliated with both the AFL and the Knights of Labor (KOL) from 1893 to 1896. Their purpose in dual affiliation was increasing the breadth of the boycott, which they had found a useful weapon. The AFL threatened to revoke the charter of the national UBW, and they withdrew from the KOL, while urging their individual members to keep their membership in the KOL. When possible, the AFL forced industrial unions to break up into craft unions, dividing their memberships into exclusive groups with individual contracts. One example was the Amalgamated Association of Street Car Employees (AASCE) in 1912 which, with the aid of Cyrus S. Ching as company negotiator for Boston's public transit system, reached a system-wide agreement for all transit workers. But the AFL and its building trades affiliates were not happy with such an arrangement. Ching, AFL President Samuel Gompers, and International President William D. Mahon of the AASCE, held conferences in which the AASCE ceded jurisdiction over carpenters, painters, electricians, and other skilled trades. The union's membership was divided into 34 distinct labor units, each with a separate agreement. Having experienced such a breakout into separate labor classifications at Boston transit, Ching opposed such a concept when he became director of industrial relations for the United States Rubber Company. According to economic analyst A. H. Raskin, Ching recognized \\"that the AFL's commitment to craft delimitation provided poor protection for the welfare of workers in a mass production industry like rubbermaking, which operated along industrial, rather than craft, lines.\\" Before Herbert Hoover became president, he befriended AFL President Gompers. Hoover, as the former United States Food Administrator, president of the Federated Engineering Societies, and then Secretary of Commerce in the Harding Cabinet in 1921, invited the heads of several \\"forward-looking\\" major corporations to meet with him. > [Hoover] asked these men why their companies didn't sit down with Gompers > and try to work out an amicable relationship with organized labor. Such a > relationship, in Hoover's opinion, would be a bulwark against the spread of > radicalism reflected in the rise of the \\"Wobblies,\\" the Industrial Workers > of the World. The Hoover initiative got no encouragement from those at the > meeting. The obstacles that Hoover did not comprehend, [Cyrus] Ching > recorded in his memoir, were that Gompers had no standing in the affairs of > any company except to the extent that AFL unions had organized the workers, > and that the federation's focus on craft unionism precluded any effective > organization of the mass-production industries by [the AFL's] affiliates. =Industrial unionism as rejection of craft unionism= Wobbly perspective Six weeks after formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League, the Industrial Workers of the World was formed in Chicago, created as a rejection of the narrow craft unionism philosophy of the AFL. From its inception, the IWW would organize without regard to sex, skills, race, creed, or national origin.Solidarity Forever--An oral history of the IWW, Stewart Bird, Dan Georgakas, Deborah Shaffer, 1985, page 140. An outgrowth of the struggles of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM), the IWW also adopted the WFM's description of the AFL as the \\"American Separation of Labor\\". While the IWW shared the concept of a mass-oriented labor movement‚Äîwhat the IWW would call One Big Union‚Äîwith the Knights of Labor, the idea of workers having much in common with employers was discarded by the IWW, whose Preamble declares that \\"the working class and the employing class have nothing in common.\\"Constitution and By-Laws of the Industrial Workers of the World, Preamble, 1905, http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/constitution/1905const.html Retrieved April 19, 2007. According to Eugene V. Debs, \\"seasoned old unionists\\" recognized in 1905 that working people could not win with the labor movement they had. Among the critiques of the AFL were organized scabbery of one union on another, jurisdictional squabbling, an autocratic leadership, and a relationship between union leaders and millionaires in the National Civic Federation that was altogether too cozy. IWW leaders believed that in the AFL there was too little solidarity, and too little \\"straight\\" labor education. These circumstances led to too little appreciation of what could be won, and too little will to win it. For many, organizing industrially is seen as conferring a more powerful structural base from which to challenge employers. Yet this very power has sometimes prompted governments to act as a counterweight to maintain the existing power relationships in society. There are historical examples. Eugene Debs formed the American Railway Union (ARU) as an industrial organization in response to craft limitations. Railroad engineers and firemen had called a strike, but other employees, particularly conductors who were organized into a different craft, did not join that strike. The conductors piloted scab engineers on the train routes, helping their employers to break the strike. In June 1894, the newly formed, industrially organized ARU voted to join in solidarity with an ongoing strike against the Pullman company. The sympathy strike demonstrated the enormous power of united action, yet resulted in a decisive government response to end the strike and destroy the union. Within hours of the ARU lending support to the boycott, Pullman traffic ceased to move from Chicago to the West. The boycott then spread to the South and the East. A statement was issued by the chairman of the General Managers Association, a \\"half-secret combination of twenty-four railroads centering on Chicago,\\" which acknowledged the power of industrial unionism: > We can handle the railway brotherhoods, but we cannot handle the A.R.U.... > We cannot handle Debs. We have got to wipe him out. The General Managers turned to the federal government, which immediately sent federal troops and United States Marshals to force an end to the strike. One union leader who closely observed the experiences of the ARU was Big Bill Haywood, who became the powerful secretary treasurer of the Western Federation of Miners (WFM). Haywood had long been a critic of the craft unionism of the AFL, and applied the industrial unionism critique to the railway brotherhoods ‚Äî closely associated as they were with the AFL ‚Äî in a strike called by his own miner's union. The WFM had sought to extend the benefits of union to mill workers who processed the ore dug by miners. Miners and mill workers walked out to support the organizing drive. The 1903-04 Cripple Creek strike was defeated when unionized railroad workers continued to haul ore from the mines to the mills, in spite of strike breakers having been introduced at mine and at mill. \\"The railroaders form the connecting link in the proposition that is scabby at both ends,\\" Haywood wrote. \\"This fight, which is entering its third year, could have been won in three weeks if it were not for the fact that the trade unions are lending assistance to the mine operators.\\" A craft unionist might argue the miners would have been better off sticking to their own business. After all, both the miner's union and the fledgling mill worker's unions had been destroyed. But Haywood took away from this experience the conviction that labor needed more, not less, industrial unionism. The miners had struck in sympathy with the smeltermen, but other unions‚Äînotably, craft unions‚Äîhad not. Haywood went on to help organize the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), which was itself injured by government action during and after World War I. In 1912, William E. Bohn was able to predict about the two foremost examples of industrial unionism then extant, \\"It is possible that neither the Industrial Workers of the World nor the Detroit I. W. W. will ever become numerically important. But the principle of industrial unionism is becoming increasingly a power in the land.\\" While the IWW was debilitated by government repression and a serious 1924 split, and the Detroit IWW simultaneously ceased to exist, the more basic principles of industrial unionism were adopted by the very successful CIO in the 1930s. =Companies prefer to be organized by craft unions= Many companies prefer no union whatsoever. However, when given the choice of an industrial union or a craft union, companies appear to prefer organization by craft unions. As an example, after the American Railway Union was destroyed, Eugene Debs, who had read Marx while serving his sentence, turned to politics, seeking solutions to the problems of working people through socialism. Some railroad workers in Indiana, Kansas, and Illinois who had been a part of Debs' ARU in 1894 resented the fact that Debs turned to socialism for, > ...[Debs] had left them without a fighting industrial union and forced them > to enter the scab craft movements after he changed the ARU to a political > movement... There was an effort to establish a new industrial union to take the place of the railroad brotherhoods. The United Brotherhood of Railway Employees (UBRE) was formed, with George Estes as president. Estes came from a faction of the Order of Railroad Telegraphers. The UBRE came to public notice when it conducted a moderately successful strike in Manitoba in 1902. Like the General Managers Association of Chicago, the Southern Pacific Railroad (SPR) acknowledged the danger in allowing railway workers to form an industrial union. The SPR hired the Pinkerton Agency to infiltrate and destroy the UBRE. One of the Pinkerton labor spy tactics was persuading workers to quit the industrial union and instead join a craft union. The defeat of the UBRE ended the last major attempt to organize North American railway workers into an industrial union. =Scranton Declaration and isolation of industrial unions= In 1904 the largest industrial union organization, the Western Federation of Miners, was under significant pressure from employer association attacks and the use of military force in Colorado. The WFM's labor federation, the American Labor Union had not gained significant membership. The AFL was the largest organized labor federation, and the UBRE felt isolated. When they applied to the AFL for a charter, the Scranton Declaration of 1901 was the AFL's guiding principle. Gompers had promised that each trade and craft would have its own union. The Scranton Declaration acknowledged that one affiliate, the United Mine Workers was formed as an industrial union, but that other skilled trades‚Äîcarpenters, machinists, etc.‚Äîwere organized as powerful craft unions. These craft unions refused to allow any encroachment upon their \\"turf\\" by the heretical industrial unionists. This concept came to be known as voluntarism. The federation turned the UBRE down in accord with the voluntarism principle. The Scranton Declaration acknowledging voluntarism was adhered to, even though the craft-based railroad brotherhoods had not yet joined the AFL. The AFL was holding the door open for craft unions that might join, and slamming it in the face of the industrial unions who wanted to join. The following year the two thousand member UBRE joined the organizing convention of the IWW. =Craft union federation adopting an industrial union concept= The craft-based AFL had been slow to organize industrial workers, and the federation remained steadfastly committed to craft unionism. This changed in the mid-1930s when, after passage of the National Labor Relations Act, workers began to clamor for union membership. In competition with the CIO movement, the AFL established Federal Labor Unions (FLUs), which were local industrial unions affiliated directly with the AFL, a concept initially envisioned in the 1886 AFL Constitution. FLUs were conceived as temporary unions, many of which were organized on an industrial basis. In keeping with the craft concept, FLUs were designed primarily for organizing purposes, with the membership destined to be distributed among the AFL's craft unions after the majority of workers in an industry were organized. =Radicalism in the union movement= A cartoon from the May, 1919 IWW periodical One Big Union, published in Revolutionary Radicalism, shows a worker (representing the working class) choosing between an AFL slogan (A Fair Day's Pay for a Fair Day's Work) and an IWW slogan (Abolition of the Wage System).Anti-IWW cartoon from The American Employer, published 1913, with the Industrial Workers of the World organizing drive editorialized as \\"a volcano of hate stirred into active eruption at Akron, by alien hands, which pour into the crater the disturbing acids and alkalis of greed, class hatred and anarchy. From the mouth of the pit rise poisonous clouds of suspicion, malice and envy to pollute the air, while from the cracked and breaking sides of the groaning mountain flow streams of lava of murder, anarchy and destruction, threatening to engulf in their path the fair cities and fertile farms of Ohio.\\"Eugene Debs' early experience with labor actions convinced him to move from craft unionism to militant industrial unionism. During his six months in prison after the American Railway Union was crushed, he became acquainted with socialist principles. Ed Boyce of the Western Federation of Miners also embraced industrial unionism, believing, as did Debs, that it had more potential than craft unionism. They likewise recognized that industrial unionism alone could not bring into existence the new society that they envisioned. They, along with the WFM's Bill Haywood and others, were instrumental in launching the Western Labor Union, which soon became the American Labor Union, which in 1905 led the way to the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW). Boyce proclaimed that labor must \\"abolish the wage system which is more destructive of human rights and liberty than any other slave system devised\\", and the IWW later echoed his words in its Preamble. \\"The working class and the employing class have nothing in common,\\" the Preamble proclaimed. \\"There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on...\\"Preamble to the Constitution, Industrial Workers of the World, 1905, http://www.workerseducation.org/crutch/constitution/1905const.html retrieved March 12, 2011 Thus, industrial unionism, guided as it was by socialist promptings, has sometimes been considered a more radical‚Äîor even revolutionary‚Äîform of unionism (see below.) The CIO and to a lesser extent, the AFL (which was already more conservative) purged themselves of radical members and officers in the years before they merged, as part of what came to be known as the (second) red scare. Some entire unions, perceived by the labor federation leadership as incapable of being reformed, were expelled or replaced. Revolutionary industrial unionism Tied closely to the concept of organizing not as a craft, or even as a group of workers with industrial ties, but rather, as a class, is the idea that all of the business world and government, and even the preponderance of the powerful industrial governments of the world, tend to unite to preserve the status quo of the economic system. This encompasses not only the various political systems and the vital question of property rights, but also the relationships between working people and their employers. Such tendencies appeared to be in play in 1917, the year of the Russian Revolution. Fred Thompson has written, \\"Capitalists believed revolution imminent, feared it, legislated against it and bought books on how to keep workers happy.\\" Such instincts also played a role when the governments of fourteen industrialized nations intervened in the civil war that followed the Russian Revolution. Likewise, when the Industrial Workers of the World became the target of government intervention during the period from 1917 to 1921, the governments of the United States, AustraliaThe Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, pp. 297 ppbk. and Canada acted simultaneously. In the United States, IWW executive board officer Frank Little was lynched from a railroad trestle. Seventeen Wobblies in Tulsa were beaten by a mob and driven out of town. In the third quarter of 1917, the New York Times ran sixty articles attacking the IWW. The Justice Department launched raids on IWW headquarters across the country. The New-York Tribune suggested that the IWW was a German front, responsible for acts of sabotage throughout the nation. Writing in 1919, Paul Brissenden quoted an IWW publication in Sydney, Australia: > All the machinery of the capitalist state has been turned against us. Our > hall has been raided periodically as a matter of principle, our literature, > our papers, pictures, and press have all been confiscated; our members and > speakers have been arrested and charged with almost every crime on the > calendar; the authorities are making unscrupulous, bitter and frantic > attempts to stifle the propaganda of the I.W.W. Brissenden also recorded that > ...several laws have been enacted which have been more or less directly > aimed at the Industrial Workers of the World. Australia led off with the > \\"Unlawful Associations Act\\" passed by the House of Representatives of the > Commonwealth in December, 1916. (Reported in the New York Times, December > 20, 1916, p. s, col. 2. Cf. infra, p. 341.) Within three months of the > passage of the Australian Act, the American States of Minnesota and Idaho > passed laws \\"defining criminal syndicalism and prohibiting the advocacy > thereof.\\" In February, 1918, the Montana legislature met in extraordinary > session and enacted a similar statute. > At Sacramento, on January 16, 1919, according to daily press reports, all of > the 46 defendants in the California I.W.W. conspiracy case tried there in > the Federal District Court were found guilty of conspiring to violate the > Constitution of the United States and the Espionage Act and with attempting > to obstruct the war activities of the Government. All of the defendants were > members‚Äîor alleged members‚Äîof the I.W.W. and the case is similar to the one > tried in Chicago in 1918. On January 17 Judge Rudkin is reported to have > sentenced 43 of the defendants to prison terms of from one to ten years (New > York Times, January 17 and 18, 1919). In essence, the lesson learned is that governments will use legislative and judicial means to thwart attempts to change the economic system, even when conducted by non-violent means. Therefore, in order to significantly improve the status of working people who sell their labor‚Äîaccording to this belief‚Äîno less than organizing as an entire class of workers can accomplish and sustain the necessary change. While Brissenden notes that IWW coal miners in Australia successfully used direct action to free imprisoned strike leaders and to win other demands, Wobbly opposition to conscription during World War I \\"became so obnoxious\\" to the Australian government that laws were passed which \\"practically made it a criminal offense to be a member of the I.W.W.\\" From its first convention in Chicago in 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) clearly stated its philosophy and its goals: rather than accommodating capitalism, the IWW sought to overthrow it. The IWW organized more broadly than did the CIO or the Knights of Labor. The IWW sought to unite the entire working class into One Big Union which would struggle for improved working conditions and wages in the short term, while working to ultimately overthrow capitalism through a general strike, after which the members of the union would manage production. =One Big Union= upright Historically, industrial unionism has frequently been associated with the concept of One Big Union (OBU). On July 12, 1919, The New England Worker published \\"The Principle of Industrial Union\\": > The principle on which industrial unionism takes its stand is the > recognition of the never ending struggle between the employers of labor and > the working class.

Political parties and industrial unionism Some political parties also promote industrial unionism, such as the Socialist Labor Party of America, whose early leader Daniel De Leon formulated a form of industrial unionism as the mechanism of government in the SLP's vision of a socialist society, and the British Labour Party which has relations with affiliated trade unions. Industrial unionism outside the United States =Australia= Verity Burgmann asserts in Revolutionary industrial unionism that the IWW in Australia provided an alternate form of labour organising, to be contrasted with the Laborism of the Australian Labor Party and the Bolshevik Communism of the Communist Party of Australia. Revolutionary industrial unionism, for Burgmann, was much like revolutionary syndicalism, but focused much more strongly on the centralised, industrial, nature of unionism. Burgmann saw Australian syndicalism, particularly anarcho-syndicalism, as focused on mythic small shop organisation. For Burgmann the IWW's vision was always a totalising vision of a revolutionary society: the Industrial Commonwealth. The IWW's politics in 2007 mirror Burgmann's analysis: the IWW does not proclaim Syndicalism, or Anarchism (despite the large number of anarcho-syndicalist members) but instead advocates Revolutionary Industrial Unionism. =United Kingdom= Marion Dutton Savage associates the spirit of industrial unionism with \\"the aspiration of workers for the control of industry\\" inspired by Robert Owen in 1833-34. The Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (GCTU) recruited skilled and unskilled workers from many industries, with membership growing to half a million within a few weeks. Frantic opposition forced the GCTU to collapse after a few months, but the ideals of the movement lingered for a time. After Chartism failed, British unions began to organize only skilled workers, and began to limit their goals in tacit support of the existing organization of industry. A new union movement that was \\"distinctly class conscious and vaguely Socialistic\\" began to organize unskilled workers in 1889. Industrial unionism thence proceeded primarily by combining craft unions into industrial formations, rather than through the birth of new industrial organizations. Industrial organizations prior to 1922 included the National Transport Workers' Federation, the National Union of Railwaymen, and the Miners' Federation of Great Britain. In 1910 Tom Mann went to France and became acquainted with syndicalism. He returned to Britain and helped to organize the Workers' International Industrial Union, which was similar to the IWW from North America. =Korea= The theory and practice of industrial unionism is not confined to the western, English speaking world. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) is committed to reorganizing their current union structure along the lines of industrial unionism.This is KCTU, Building Industrial Unionism http://kctu.org/2003/html/sub_01.php =South Africa= The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is also organized along the lines of industrial unionism.About Cosatu, One industry, one union - one country, one federation See also * Labor federation competition in the U.S. Notes References      * * External links * De Leon, Industrial Unionism * New Unionism Network, Unionism 101 Category:Labor relations Category:Syndicalism Category:Industrial Workers of the World ","title":"Industrial unionism"},{"id":"268778","text":"Flagler College is a private liberal arts college in St. Augustine, Florida. It was founded in 1968 and offers 33 undergraduate majors and 1 master's program. It also has a campus in Tallahassee.  History  Founded in 1968, the campus comprises , the centerpiece of which is the Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel, built in 1888 as a luxury hotel. The architects were John Carrere and Thomas Hastings, working for Henry Morrison Flagler, the industrialist, oil magnate and railroad pioneer. It is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Lawrence Lewis, Jr., was the driving force behind Flagler's development. It was his vision to create a small, private liberal arts college on the old hotel grounds. Lewis was Chairman of Flagler's Board of Trustees for more than 20 years, guiding the college through a reorganization in 1971. He directed millions of dollars through foundations, family and personal funds into new construction, restoration projects, endowment and various other programs to ensure Flager's continued success. Lewis was related to Henry Flagler through his mother, Louise Wise Lewis Francis, who was the niece of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, who married Henry Flagler in 1901 making him Lewis' great uncle.\\"Remembering Molly Wiley\\" Flagler College Magazine In 2014, Flagler College was ranked eighth among regional colleges in the South according to the U.S. News & World Report college survey. But in February 2014 the college's vice president of enrollment management resigned after it was determined that he had been altering student test scores, GPAs, and student rankings to enhance the college's image, standing, and reputation. The college hired a Jacksonville law firm to investigate. The report indicated that the college had been reporting false information since 2004 to various organizations, including the U.S. Department of Education and various ranking organizations. Proctor library Proctor Library The Proctor Library, in the northwest corner of campus, is Flagler's sole library facility. It is named after William L. Proctor, Flagler's chancellor, who was president of the college from 1971 until 2001. Like many of the historic buildings on campus, the Proctor Library's architectural design reflects the Gilded Age style popular during the time of Henry Flagler's construction of the Ponce de Le√≥n Hotel in 1888. The Proctor Library was built in 1996, replacing the demolished home of artist Felix de Crano, which had been the last classic Shingle Style house in St. Augustine. The library's collection contains approximately 102,047 printed volumes, 212,689 electronic books, 4180 audiovisual items, 630 periodicals, and 5 newspapers, as well as almost 44,000 full-text electronic periodicals and 50 online databases. The library provides students with a wide variety of computer and technology related services including, scanning, printing, faxing, photocopying, and phone charging stations. In addition, Mac and PC computers are available for students on the first floor of the library as well as Wireless Internet access throughout the building. Access to and the use of the Proctor Library is limited to Flagler College students, faculty, and staff, and is not open to the general public without a written request. Student life =Organizations= Flagler offers membership in 11 honor societies, including Alpha Chi, Alpha Psi Omega, Alpha Phi Sigma, Sigma Beta Delta, Pi Sigma Alpha, Kappa Delta Pi, Omicron Delta Kappa, Phi Alpha Theta, Psi Chi, Alpha Kappa Delta, and Sigma Tau Delta. In addition, there are 3 student organizations, 30 campus clubs, and 9 academic organizations. Flagler also has 6 sports clubs, including club hockey, dance club, men's lacrosse club, men's soccer club, winter guard, and a quidditch team. = Athletics = Flagler competes in 14 varsity sports (basketball, cheerleading, cross country, golf, soccer, and tennis for men and women, baseball for men only, and volleyball and softball for women only) in Division II that compete in the NCAA. Its teams are called the Saints. In the 2009‚Äì10 season Flagler athletics began to play in the Peach Belt Conference.\\"Montevallo and Flagler to Join Peach Belt Conference\\" Peach Belt Conference In 2009 the Flagler College Lady Saints volleyball team made it to the national championship, and finished in the top four of Division II volleyball teams in the nation.

Golson is known for co-founding and co-leading The Jazztet with trumpeter Art Farmer in 1959. From the late 1960s through the 1970s Golson was in demand as an arranger for film and television and thus was less active as a performer, but he and Farmer reformed the Jazztet in 1982. In addition to \\"I Remember Clifford\\", many of Golson's compositions have become jazz standards including \\"Blues March\\", \\"Whisper Not\\", and \\"Killer Joe\\". Biography While in high school in Philadelphia, Golson played with several other promising young musicians, including John Coltrane, Red Garland, Jimmy Heath, Percy Heath, Philly Joe Jones, and Red Rodney. After graduating from Howard University, Golson joined Bull Moose Jackson's rhythm and blues band; Tadd Dameron, whom Golson came to consider the most important influence on his writing, was Jackson's pianist at the time. From 1953 to 1959 Golson played with Dameron's band and then with the bands of Lionel Hampton, Johnny Hodges, Earl Bostic, Dizzy Gillespie, and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers with whom he recorded the classic Moanin' in 1958. Golson was working with the Lionel Hampton band at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in 1956 when he learned that Clifford Brown, a noted and well-liked jazz trumpeter who had done a stint with him in Dameron's band, had died in a car accident. Golson was so moved by the event that he composed the threnody \\"I Remember Clifford\\", as a tribute to a fellow musician and friend. In addition to \\"I Remember Clifford\\", many of Golson's compositions have become jazz standards. Songs such as \\"Stablemates\\", \\"Killer Joe\\", \\"Whisper Not\\", \\"Along Came Betty\\", and \\"Are You Real?\\" have been performed and recorded numerous times by many musicians.Bailey, Phil and Hancock, Benny (1979) Benny Golson: Eight Jazz Classics, p. iii. Jamey Aebersold Jazz. Golson at \\"Kimball's\\" Jazz club, San Francisco, with the Jazztet, July 21, 1985. From 1959 to 1962 Golson co-led the Jazztet with Art Farmer. Golson then left jazz to concentrate on studio and orchestral work for 12 years. During this time he composed music for such television shows as Mannix, Ironside, Room 222, M*A*S*H, The Partridge Family and Mission: Impossible. He also formulated and conducted arrangements to various recordings, such as Eric Is Here, a 1967 album by Eric Burdon, which features five of Golson's arrangements, conducted by Golson.Credits - Eric Is Here; Discogs. Retrieved 2017-07-08. During the mid-1970s Golson returned to jazz playing and recording. Critic Scott Yannow of Allmusic wrote that Golson's sax style underwent a major shift with his performing comeback, more resembling avant-garde Archie Shepp than the swing- era Don Byas influence of Golson's youth.Yannow, Scott. Allmusic biography, accessed 06 April 2019 In 1982 Golson re-organized the Jazztet.Feather, Leonard & Gitler, Ira (2007) The Biographical Encyclopedia of Jazz, p. 261. Oxford University Press. In 1995 Golson received the NEA Jazz Masters Award of the National Endowment for the Arts. In 1999, Golson was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music. Golson made a cameo appearance in the 2004 movie The Terminal, related to his appearance in \\"A Great Day in Harlem\\", a group photograph of prominent jazz musicians. Main character Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) travels to the US from Europe to obtain Golson's signature; Golson was one of seven musicians then surviving from the photo, the others being Johnny Griffin (died 2008), Eddie Locke (died 2009), Hank Jones (died 2010), Marian McPartland (died 2013), Horace Silver (died 2014), and Sonny Rollins. Golson's song \\"Something in B Flat\\" (from the album Benny Golson's New York Scene) can be heard during a scene where Viktor is painting and redecorating part of an airport terminal; in a later scene, Golson's band performs \\"Killer Joe\\". In October 2007 Golson received the Mellon Living Legend Legacy Award presented by the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation at a ceremony at the Kennedy Center. Additionally, during the same month, he won the University of Pittsburgh International Academy of Jazz Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award at the university's 37th Annual Jazz Concert in the Carnegie Music Hall. In November 2009, Benny was inducted into the International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame during a performance at the University of Pittsburgh's annual jazz seminar and concert. The Howard University Jazz Studies program created a prestigious award in his honor called the \\"Benny Golson Jazz Master Award\\" in 1996.

Situated north of the capital Beirut, it is the capital of the North Governorate and the Tripoli District. Tripoli overlooks the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and it is the northernmost seaport in Lebanon. It holds a string of four small islands offshore, and they are also the only islands in Lebanon. The Palm Islands were declared a protected area because of their status of haven for endangered loggerhead turtles (Chelona mydas), rare monk seals and migratory birds. Tripoli borders the city of El Mina, the port of the Tripoli District, which it is geographically conjoined with to form the greater Tripoli conurbation. The history of Tripoli dates back at least to the 14th century BCE. The city is well known for containing the largest Crusader fortress in Lebanon, the Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles, and it has the second highest concentration of Mamluk architecture after Cairo. With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian‚ÄìLebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.http://www.mafhoum.com/press10/312P1.htm  Names  Tripoli had a number of different names as far back as the Phoenician age. In the Amarna letters the name \\"Derbly\\", possibly a Semitic cognate of the city's modern Arabic name ·π¨arƒÅbulus, was mentioned, and in other places \\"Ahlia\\" or \\"Wahlia\\" are mentioned (14th century BCE).Les peuples et les civilisations du Proche Orient by JawƒÅd B≈´lus. p. 308. In an engraving concerning the invasion of Tripoli by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (888‚Äì859 BCE), it is called Mahallata or Mahlata, Mayza, and Kayza.Wanderings ‚àí2: History of the Jews by Chaim Potok. p. 169. Under the Phoenicians, the name Athar was used to refer to Tripoli.History of Syria, Including Lebanon and Palestine by Philip Khuri Hitti. p. 225. When the Ancient Greeks settled in the city they called it Œ§œÅŒØœÄŒøŒªŒπœÇ (Tripolis), meaning \\"three cities,\\" influenced by the earlier phonetically similar but etymologically unrelated name Derbly.Lebanon in Pictures by Peter Roop, Sam Schultz, Margaret J. Goldstein. p. 17. The Arabs called it ·π¨arƒÅbulus and ·π¨arƒÅbulus al-≈†ƒÅm (referring to bilƒÅd al-≈†ƒÅm, to distinguish it from the Libyan city with the same name). Today, Tripoli is also known as al-fay·∏•ƒÅ‚Ä≤ (ÿßŸÑŸÅŸäÿ≠ÿßÿ°), which is a term derived from the Arabic verb faha which is used to indicate the diffusion of a scent or smell. Tripoli was once known for its vast orange orchards. During the season of blooming, the pollen of orange flowers was said to be carried on the air, creating a splendid perfume which filled the city and suburbs. History Overview of historical districts in Tripoli Evidence of settlement in Tripoli dates back as early as 1400 BCE. In the 9th century, the Phoenicians established a trading station in Tripoli and later, under Persian rule, the city became the center of a confederation of the Phoenician city-states of Sidon, Tyre, and Arados Island. Under Hellenistic rule, Tripoli was used as a naval shipyard and the city enjoyed a period of autonomy. It came under Roman rule around 64 BCE. The 551 Beirut earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Byzantine city of Tripoli along with other Mediterranean coastal cities. During Umayyad rule, Tripoli became a commercial and shipbuilding center. It achieved semi- independence under Fatimid rule, when it developed into a center of learning. The Crusaders laid siege to the city at the beginning of the 12th century and were able finally to enter it in 1109. This caused extensive destruction, including the burning of Tripoli's famous library, Dar al-'Ilm (House of Knowledge), with its thousands of volumes. During the Crusaders' rule the city became the capital of the County of Tripoli. In 1289, it fell to the Mamluks and the old port part of the city was destroyed. A new inland city was then built near the old castle. During Ottoman rule from 1516 to 1918, it retained its prosperity and commercial importance. Tripoli and all of Lebanon was under French mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence. =Ancient period= Many historians reject the presence of any Phoenician civilization in Tripoli before the 8th (or sometimes 4th) century BCE. Others argue that the north‚Äìsouth gradient of Phoenician port establishments on the Lebanese coast indicates an earlier age for the Phoenician Tripoli. Tripoli has not been extensively excavated because the ancient site lies buried beneath the modern city of El Mina. However, a few accidental finds are now in museums. Excavations in El Mina revealed skeletal remains of ancient wolves, eels, and gazelles, part of the ancient southern port quay, grinding mills, different types of columns, wheels, Bows, and a necropolis from the end of the Hellenistic period. A sounding made in the Crusader castle uncovered Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, in addition to Roman, Byzantine, and Fatimid remains. At the Abou Halka area (at the southern entrance of Tripoli) refuges dating to the early (30,000 years old) and middle Stone Age were uncovered.Saliba, R., Jeblawi, S., and Ajami, G., Tripoli the Old City: Monument Survey ‚Äì Mosques and Madrasas; A Sourcebook of Maps and Architectural Drawings, Beirut: American University of Beirut Publications, 1995. Ruins in Tripoli Tripoli became a financial center and main port of northern Phoenicia with sea trade (East Mediterranean and the West), and caravan trade (North Syria and hinterland). Under the Seleucids, Tripoli gained the right to mint its own coins (112 BCE); it was granted autonomy between 104 and 105, which it retained until 64 BCE. At the time, Tripoli was a center of shipbuilding and cedar timber trade (like other Phoenician cities). During the Roman and Byzantine period, Tripoli witnessed the construction of important public buildings including municipal stadium or gymnasium due to strategic position of the city midway on the imperial coastal highway leading from Antioch to Ptolemais. In addition, Tripoli retained the same configuration of three distinct and administratively independent quarters (Aradians, Sidonians, and Tyrians). The territory outside the city was divided between the three quarters. =Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid periods= Tripoli gained in importance as a trading centre for the whole Mediterranean after it was inhabited by the Arabs. Tripoli was the port city of Damascus; the second military port of the Arab Navy, following Alexandria; a prosperous commercial and shipbuilding center; a wealthy principality under the Kutama Ismaili Shia Banu Ammar emirs. During a visit by the traveler Nasir-i-Khusrau in 1047, he estimated the size of the population in Tripoli to be around 20,000 and the whole population were Shia Muslims. And according to Nasir Khusraw, the Fatimid Sultan raised a mighty army from Tripoli to defend it against Byzantine, Frankish, Andalusian and Moroccan invasions and raids. Legally, Tripoli was part of the jurisdiction of the military province of Damascus (Jund Dimashq).Tadmouri, O. AS., Lubnan min al-fath al-islami hatta sukut al- dawla al-'umawiyya (13‚Äì132 H/ 634‚Äì750 CE): Silsilat Dirasat fi Tarih AlSahel AlShami, Tripoli, 1990. Arabic. =Crusader period= Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles The city became the chief town of the County of Tripoli (Latin Crusader state of the Levant) extending from Byblos to Latakia and including the plain of Akkar with the famous Krak des Chevaliers. Tripoli was also the seat of a bishopric. Tripoli was home to a busy port and was a major center of silk weaving, with as many as 4,000 looms. Important products of the time included lemons, oranges, and sugar cane. For 180 years, during the Frankish rule, Occitan was among the languages spoken in Tripoli and neighbouring villages. At that time, Tripoli had a heterogeneous population including Western Europeans, Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Nestorians, Jews, and Muslims. During the Crusade period, Tripoli witnessed the growth of the inland settlement surrounding the \\"Pilgrim's Mountain\\" (the citadel) into a built-up suburb including the main religious monuments of the city such as: The \\"Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Pilgrim's Mountain\\" (incorporating the Shiite shrine), the Church of Saint Mary's of the Tower, and the Carmelite Church. The state was a major base of operations for the military order of the Knights Hospitaller, who occupied the famous castle Krak Des Chevaliers (today a UNESCO world heritage site). The state ceased to exist in 1289, when it was captured by the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Qalawun. =Mamluk period= Minaret of the Mansouri Great Mosque Downtown historical Tripoli During the Mamluk period, Tripoli became a central city and provincial capital of the six kingdoms in Mamluk Syria. Tripoli ranked third after Aleppo and Damascus. The kingdom was subdivided into six wilayahs or provinces and extended from Byblos and Aqra mountains south, to Latakia and al Alawiyyin mountains north. It also included Hermel, the plain of Akkar, and Hosn al-Akrad (Krak des Chevaliers).Tadmouri, O. AS., Tarikh Tarablus al-siyasi wa'-hadari Aabr al-'usour, Tripoli, 1984. Tripoli became a major trading port of Syria supplying Europe with candy, loaf and powdered sugar (especially during the latter part of the 14th century). The main products from agriculture and small industry included citrus fruits, olive oil, soap, and textiles (cotton and silk, especially velvet). The Mamluks formed the ruling class holding main political, military and administrative functions. Arabs formed the population base (religious, industrial, and commercial functions) and the general population included the original inhabitants of the city, immigrants from different parts of Syria, North Africans who accompanied Qalawun's army during the liberation of Tripoli, Eastern Orthodox Christians, some Western families, and a minority of Jews. The population size of Mamluk Tripoli is estimated at 20,000‚Äì40,000; against 100,000 in each of Damascus and Aleppo. Mamluk Tripoli witnessed a high rate of urban growth and a fast city development (according to traveler's accounts). It also had poles of growth including the fortress, the Grand Mosque, and the river banks. The city had seven guard towers on the harbor site to defend the inland city, including what still stands today as the Lion Tower. During the period the castle of Saint Gilles was expanded as the Citadel of Mamluk Tripoli. The \\"Aqueduct of the Prince\\" was reused to bring water from the Rash'in spring. Several bridges were constructed and the surrounding orchards expanded through marsh drainage. Fresh water was supplied to houses from their roofs. The urban form of Mamluk Tripoli was dictated mainly by climate, site configuration, defense, and urban aesthetics. The layout of major thoroughfares was set according to prevailing winds and topography. The city had no fortifications, but heavy building construction characterized by compact urban forms, narrow and winding streets for difficult city penetration. Residential areas were bridged over streets at strategic points for surveillance and defense. The city also included many loopholes and narrow slits at street junctions. The religious and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise a fine example of the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or moulded window frame. Among the finest is the madrassa al- Burtasiyah, with an elegant fa√ßade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door. East Tripoli Public buildings in Mamluk Tripoli were emphasized through sitting, fa√ßade treatment, and street alignment. Well-cut and well-dressed stones (local sandstone) were used as media of construction and for decorative effects on elevations and around openings (the ablaq technique of alternating light and dark stone courses). Bearing walls were used as vertical supports. Cross vaults covered most spaces from prayer halls to closed rectangular rooms, to galleries around courtyards. Domes were constructed over conspicuous and important spaces like tomb chambers, mihrab, and covered courtyards. Typical construction details in Mamluk Tripoli included cross vaults with concave grooves meeting in octagonal openings or concave rosettes as well as simple cupolas or ribbed domes. The use of double drums and corner squinches was commonly used to make the transition from square rooms to round domes. Decorations in Mamluk buildings concentrated on the most conspicuous areas of buildings: minarets, portals, windows, on the outside, and mihrab, qiblah wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fishscale motifs, joggled lintels or voussoirs, inscriptions, and muqarnas) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and include the use of marble marquetry, stucco, and glass mosaic). Mosques evenly spread with major concentration of madrasas around the Mansouri Great Mosque. All khans were located in the northern part of the city for easy accessibility from roads to Syria. Hammams (public baths) were carefully located to serve major population concentrations: one next to the Grand Mosque, the other in the center of the commercial district, and the third in the right-bank settlement. Major buildings in Mamluk Tripoli included six congregational mosques (the Mansouri Great Mosque, al-Aattar, Taynal, al- Uwaysiyat, al-Burtasi, and al-Tawbat Mosques). In addition, there were two quarter mosques (Abd al-Wahed and Arghoun Shah), and two mosques that were built on empty land (al-Burtasi and al-Uwaysiyat). Other mosques incorporated earlier structures (churches, khans, and shops). Mamluk Tripoli also included 16 madrasas of which four no longer exist (al-Zurayqiyat, al-Aattar, al- Rifaiyah, and al-Umariyat). Six of the madrasas concentrated around the Grand Mosque. Tripoli also included a Khanqah, many secular buildings, five Khans, three hammams (Turkish baths) that are noted for their cupolas. Hammams were luxuriously decorated and the light streaming down from their domes enhances the inner atmosphere of the place. =Ottoman period= Tripoli gold bezant in Arabic (1270‚Äì1300), and Tripoli silver gros (1275‚Äì1287), British Museum During the Ottoman period, Tripoli became the provincial capital and chief town of the Eyalet of Tripoli, encompassing the coastal territory from Byblos to Tarsus and the inland Syrian towns of Homs and Hama; the two other eyalets were Aleppo Eyalet, and ≈ûam Eyalet. Until 1612, Tripoli was considered as the port of Aleppo. It also depended on Syrian interior trade and tax collection from mountainous hinterland. Tripoli witnessed a strong presence of French merchants during the 17th and 18th centuries and became under intense inter- European competition for trade. Tripoli was reduced to a sanjak centre in the Vilayet of Beirut in 19th century and retained her status until 1918 when it was captured by British forces. Public works in Ottoman Tripoli included the restoration of the Citadel of Tripoli by Suleiman I, the Magnificent. Later governors brought further modifications to the original Crusader structure used as garrison center and prison. Khan al-Saboun (originally a military barrack) was constructed in the center of the city to control any uprising. Ottoman Tripoli also witnessed the development of the southern entrance of the city and many buildings, such as the al-Muallaq or \\"hanging\\" Mosque (1559), al-Tahhan Mosque (early 17th century), and al-Tawbah mosque (Mamluk construction, destroyed by 1612 flood and restored during early Ottoman Period). It also included several secular buildings, such as Khan al-Saboun (early 17th century) and Hammam al-Jadid (1740). Demographics Tripoli has an overwhelming majority of Sunni Muslims. Lebanon's small Alawite community is concentrated in the Jabal Mohsen neighbourhood. Christians constitute some 5% of the population of the city.Riad Yazbeck. \\"Return of the Pink Panthers?\\" . Mideast Monitor. Vol. 3, No. 2, August 2008 Geography =Climate= Tripoli has a Hot-summer Mediterranean climate (Csa) with mild wet winters and very dry, hot summers. Temperatures are moderated throughout the year due to the warm Mediterranean current coming from Western Europe. Therefore, temperatures are warmer in the winter by around 10 ¬∞C (18 ¬∞F) and cooler in the summer by around 7 ¬∞C (13 ¬∞F) compared to the interior of Lebanon. Although snow is an extremely rare event that only occurs around once every ten years, hail is common and occurs fairly regularly in the winter. Rainfall is concentrated in the winter months, with the summer typically being very dry. =Offshore islands= Palm Islands Nature Reserve Tripoli has many offshore islands. The Palm Islands Nature Reserve, or the Rabbits' Island, is the largest of the islands with an area of . The name \\"Araneb\\" or Rabbits comes from the great numbers of rabbits that were grown on the island during the time of the French mandate early in the 20th century. It is now a nature reserve for green turtles, rare birds and rabbits. Declared as a protected area by UNESCO in 1992, camping, fire building or other depredation is forbidden. In addition to its scenic landscape, the Palm Island is also a cultural heritage site. Evidence for human occupation, dated back to the Crusader period, was uncovered during 1973 excavations by the General Directorate of Antiquities. The Bakar Islands, also known as Abdulwahab Island, were leased to Adel and Khiereddine Abdulwahab as a shipyard, since the Ottoman rule and till this day a well known ship and marine contractor. It was also known as St Thomas Island during the Crusades. It is the closest to the shore and can be accessed via a bridge that was built in 1998. Bellan Island's name comes from a plant found on the island and used to make brooms. Some people claim that the name comes from the word \\"blue whale\\" (Baleine in French) that appeared next to the island in early 20th century. Fanar Island is long and is the home of a light-house built during the 1960s. Architecture =Citadel of Raymond de Saint-Gilles= the citadel takes its name from Raymond de Saint-Gilles, who dominated the city in 1102 and commanded a fortress to be built in which he named Mont Pelerin (Mt Pilgrim). The original castle was burnt down in 1289, and rebuilt again on numerous occasions and was rebuilt in 1307‚Äì08 by Emir Essendemir Kurgi. Later the citadel was rebuilt in part by the Ottoman Empire which can be seen today, with its massive Ottoman gateway, over which is an engraving from S√ºleyman the Magnificent who had ordered the restoration. In the early 19th century, the Citadel was extensively restored by the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar. =The Clock Tower= The Al-Tell Clock Tower The Clock tower is one of the most iconic monuments in Tripoli. The tower is located in Al-Tell square, and was constructed by the Ottomans as a gift to the city of Tripoli. The Clock tower recently underwent a complete renovation in 1992 with personal funding from the honorary Turkish consul of Northern Lebanon, Sobhi Akkari, and the second at February 2016 as a gift from the Turkish prime minister in cooperation with the Committee of Antiquities and Heritage in the municipality of Tripoli, and now the clock tower is again operational. \\"Al Manshieh\\" which is one of the oldest parks in Tripoli, is located next to the clock tower. This clock tower was erected in 1906 to celebrate the 30th year of Abdulhamid II of the Ottoman Empire, like the Jaffa Clock Tower and many others throughout the Empire. =Hammams= Hammam an-Nuri Tripoli Lebanon When Tripoli was visited by Ibn Batutah in 1355, he described the newly founded Mamluk city. \\"Traversed by water-channels and full of‚Äô gardens\\", he writes, \\"the houses are newly built. The sea lies two leagues distant, and the ruins of the old town are seen on the sea-shore. It was taken by the Franks, but al- Malik ath-Th√°hir (Qala‚Äôun) retook it from them, and then laid the place in ruins and built the present town. There are fine baths here.‚Äô‚Äô Indeed, the hammams built in Tripoli by the early Mamluk governors were splendid edifices and many of them are still present until today. Some of the more known are: * Abed * Izz El-Din * Hajeb * Jadid * An-Nouri, built 1333 by the Mamluk governor Nur El-Din, is located in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque. =Oscar Niemeyer's Rachid Karame Fairground= Oscar Niemeyer was commissioned to design the International Fairgrounds of Tripoli in 1963, but in 1975, Lebanon's civil war interrupted construction of this modernist landmark. The 10,000-hectare site and its 15 buildings remain today, incomplete concrete structures in our contemporary, labyrinthine times. =Tripoli Railway Station= =Churches= Many churches in Tripoli are a reminder of the history of the city. These churches also show the diversity of Christians in Lebanon and particularly in Tripoli: * Beshara Catholic Church * Armenian Evangelical Baptist Church * Latin Church (Roman Catholic) * Moutran Church * Armenian Orthodox Church * Greek Catholic Church * St Efram Syriac Orthodox Church * St. Elie Orthodox Church * St. John of the Pilgrims Mount church * St. Jorjios (George) Catholic Church * St. Jorjios (George) Orthodox Cathedral * St. Jorjios (George) Orthodox Church ‚Äì Mar Jirjis * St. Joseph Al-Serian Catholic Church * St. Maroon (Mar Maroon Church) * St. Mary Salvador Maronite Church * St. Mary (Saydeh) Maronite Church * St. Michael Orthodox Church * St. Michael Maronite Church ‚Äì Al Koubbeh * St. Michael Maronite Church * St. Nicolas Church for the Greek Orthodox * St. Thomas Church =Mosques= Taynal Mosque Tripoli is a very rich city containing many mosques that are spread all over the city. In every district of the city there is a mosque. During the Mamluk era, a lot of mosques were built and many still remain until today. Some of the more known mosques: * Aattar * Abou Bakr Al Siddeeq * Arghoun Shah * Bertasi * Kabir al Aali * Mahmoud Beik the Sanjak * Mansouri Great Mosque * Omar Ibn El-Khattab Mosque * Sidi Abdel Wahed * Tawbah Mosque * Tawjih Mosque * Taynal Mosque * Al Bachir Mosque * Hamza Mosque * Al Rahma Mosque * Al Salam Mosque Education Tripoli has a large number of schools of all levels, public and private. It is also served by several universities within the city limits as well as in its metro area. The universities in Tripoli and its metro area are: * University of Tripoli Lebanon * The Lebanese University ‚Äì North Lebanon Branch * Universite St Joseph ‚Äì North Lebanon * Lebanese International University (Dahr el Ein, Just outside the city) * Al-Manar University of Tripoli * Jinan University * University of Balamand (Qelhat, in the Koura district, just outside the city) * Notre Dame University (Barsa, in the Koura district, just outside the city) * Arts, Sciences and Technology University in Lebanon-North Lebanon Branch * Beirut Arab University ‚Äì North Lebanon Branch * Universite Saint Espirt de Kaslik ‚Äì Chekka ( Just Outside The City ) * Universit√© de Technologie et de Sciences Appliqu√©es Libano-Fran√ßaise (chamber of commerce) * Azm university Economy =International Fair of Tripoli= The International Fair of Tripoli site,International Fair of Tripoli formally known as the Rachid Karami International Exhibition Center, is a complex of buildings designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer. The site was built for a World's Fair event to be held in the city, but construction was halted in 1975 due to the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, and never resumed. The site contains 15 semi-completed Niemeyer buildings within an approximate 1 km2 (250 acres) area near Tripoli's southern entrance. See gallery below. =Commerce= Tripoli, while once economically comparable to Beirut, has declined in recent decades. Organisations such as the Business Incubation Association in Tripoli (BIAT) are currently trying to revive traditional export businesses such as furniture production, artisanal copper goods, soaps, as well as expand new industries such as ICT offshoring and new technological invention. The Tripoli Special Economic Zone (TSEZ) was established in 2008 to provide exemptions from many taxes and duties for investment projects that have more than $300,000 of capital and more than half their workers from Lebanon. It is a 55-hectare site adjacent to the Port of Tripoli. Recently, a Tripoli development plan called \\"Tripoli Vision 2020\\" has been formulated and supported by a number of advisory councils including influential key government officials and prominent businessmen in the city. The goal of the project is to provides a comprehensive framework consisting of promoting investment, investing, training, re-skilling, talent placement and output promotion to reinvigorate the city's economy. The Tripoli Vision 2020 was sponsored by the Prime Minister Saad Hariri Office and the Tripoli MPs Joint Office with the comprehensive study conducted by Samir Chreim of SCAS Inc. =The Soap Khan= The Soap Khan of Tripoli Lebanon The khan, built around a square courtyard decorated with a fountain, houses soap making workshops and shops. At the end of the 15th century, the governor of Tripoli Yusuf Sayfa Pasha established Khan Al Saboun (the hotel of soap traders). This market was finished at the beginning of the 16th century, the last days of the Mamluk rule. The manufacture of soap was very popular in Tripoli. There, the market became a trade center where soap was produced and sold. Afterwards, traders of Tripoli began to export their soap to Europe. Initially, perfumed soaps were offered as gifts in Europe and as a result, handiwork developed in Tripoli. Due to the ongoing increase of the demand, craftsmen started to consider soap making as a real profession and real art which led to an increased demand for Tripoli soap in various Arab and Asian countries. Currently, many varieties of soap are manufactured and sold in Tripoli such as anti-acne soaps, moisturizing soaps, slimming soaps, etc. which has increased an exportation of these soap products. The raw material used for these kinds of soap is olive oil. The Tripoli soap is also composed of: honey, essential oils, and natural aromatic raw materials like flowers, petals, and herbs. The soaps are dried in the sun, in a dry atmosphere, allowing the evaporation of the water that served to mix the different ingredients. The drying operation lasts for almost three months. As the water evaporates, a thin white layer appears on the soap surface, from the soda that comes from the sea salts. The craftsman brushes the soap very carefully with his hand until the powder trace is entirely eliminated. The Tailors‚Äô Khan =Khan el-Khayyatin‚ÄìThe Tailors' Khan= Unlike other khans built around a square courtyard, el-Khayyatin, built in the 14th century, is a 60 meter long passage with arches on each side. =Arabic sweets= Tripoli is regionally known for its Arabic sweets where people consider it as one of the main attractions and reasons to visit the city. Some sweetshops have even built a regionally and even internationally recognized brand name like Abdul Rahman & Rafaat Al Hallab, who both became so popular, opening shops outside Tripoli and shipping sweets boxes worldwide.

The bay is surrounded mostly by metropolitan Greater Melbourne in its main eastern portion north of the Mornington Peninsula, and the city of Greater Geelong in the much smaller western portion north of the Bellarine Peninsula. Geographically, the bay covers and the shore stretches roughly , with the volume of water around . Most of the bay is navigable, although it is extremely shallow for its size‚Äîthe deepest portion is only , and half the bay is shallower than . Before European settlement, the area around Port Phillip was divided between the territories of the Wathaurong (to the west), Wurundjeri (north) and Boonwurrung (south and east) Nations. Its waters and coast are home to seals, whales, dolphins, corals and many kinds of seabirds and migratory waders. The first Europeans to enter the bay were the crews of , commanded by John Murray and, ten weeks later, commanded by Matthew Flinders, in 1802. Subsequent expeditions into the bay took place in 1803 to establish the first settlement in Victoria, near Sorrento, but was abandoned in 1804. Thirty years later, settlers from Tasmania returned to establish Melbourne, now the state's capital city, at the mouth of the Yarra River in 1835 and Geelong at Corio Bay in 1838. Today Port Phillip is the most densely populated catchment in Australia with an estimated 4.5 million people living around the bay; Melbourne's suburbs extend around much of the northern and eastern shorelines, and the city of Geelong sprawls around Corio Bay, in the bay's western arm. Prehistory Port Phillip formed between the end of the last Ice Age around 8000 BCE and around 6000 BCE, when the sea-level rose to drown what was then the lower reaches of the Yarra River, vast river plains, wetlands and lakes. The Yarra and other tributaries flowed down what is now the middle of the bay, formed a lake in the southern reaches of the bay, dammed by The Heads, subsequently pouring out into Bass Strait. The Aboriginal people were in occupation of the area long before the bay was formed, with evidence of occupation dating at least 40,000 years ago. Settler records indicate an oral history with at least 18,000 years of linearity when Boonwurrung Elder Ningerranarro spoke of his ancestors hunting kangaroo and possum where the Bay now lies. Large piles of semi-fossilised sea-shells known as middens, can still be seen in places around the shoreline, marking the spots where Aboriginal people held feasts. They made a good living from the abundant sea-life, which included penguins and seals. In the cold season, they wore possum-skin cloaks and intricate feathered head-dresses. A dry period combined with sand bar formation, may have dried the bay out as recently as between 800 BCE and 1000 CE.

G.R, Holdgate, B.Geurin, M.W. Wallace, and S.J.Gallagher European exploration In 1800, Lieutenant James Grant was the first known European to pass through Bass Strait from west to east in . He was also the first to see, and crudely chart, the south coast from Cape Banks in South Australia to Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. Grant gave the name \\"Governor King's Bay\\" to the body of water between Cape Otway and Wilsons Promontory, but did not venture in and discover Port Phillip. 1803 map by Charles Grimes of Port Phillip The first Europeans to find and enter Port Phillip, were the crew of the Lady Nelson, commanded by John Murray, which entered the bay on 15 February 1802.Norman Houghton ‚Äì 'The Story of Geelong' Murray called the bay Port King after the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King. On 4 September 1805, King formally renamed it Port Phillip, in honour of his predecessor Arthur Phillip.Port Phillip Conservation Council: Excerpts from the 'Port Phillip Survey 1957-1963' Murray chose to base the Lady Nelson off what is now known as Sorrento Beach. Within days, his contingent was ambushed in an \\"unprovoked attack\\" by the local resident clan of the Boon wurrung. Several Aboriginal Australians were shot at by musket fire and Murray ordered grapeshot and round shot to be fired from the carronades aboard the ship at the fleeing attackers. Murray said After exploring the southern part of the bay, Murray formally took possession of the area on 8 March 1802 for King George III of Great Britain in a small ceremony at a place now known as the Point King Foreshore Reserve in Sorrento. A few days later Murray sailed out of the heads and returned to Sydney. About ten weeks after Murray, Matthew Flinders in also found and entered the bay, unaware Murray had been there. The official history of Nicholas Baudin's explorations in Le G√©ographe claimed they too had sighted the entrance at that time (30 March 1802) but this is almost certainly a later embellishment or error, being absent from the ship's logs and Baudin's own accounts. As a result of Murray's and Flinders' reports, King sent Lieutenant Charles Robbins in to explore Port Phillip fully. This surveying party, which included Charles Grimes, produced a mostly complete chart of Port Phillip including the mouth of the Yarra River, which they visited on 2 February 1803. Robbins found Aboriginal habitations and groups of Aboriginal people at Tootgarook, Carrum Carrum, on the banks of the Yarra and at Geelong. British settlement The memorial at Sorrento marking the site of the first British settlement on Port Phillip bay in 1803 King decided to place a convict settlement at Port Phillip, mainly to stake a claim to southern Australia ahead of the French. On 10 October 1803 a convoy of two ships and Ocean led by Captain David Collins carrying 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers' wives and a child, and 307 convicts with 17 convicts' wives and 7 children) entered Port Philip Bay. After some investigation it was decided to establish the settlement at a spot known as Sullivan Bay, very close to where Sorrento now exists. The expedition landed at Sullivan Bay on 17 October 1803, and the first of the \\"orders\\" issued by Collins bears that date. On 25 October, the King's birthday, the British flag was hoisted over the tiny settlement and a little salvo of musketry celebrated the royal occasion. On 25 November the first white child was born in Victoria and was baptised on Christmas Day, receiving the name of William James Hobart Thorne. The first marriage took place on 28 November, when a free woman, Hannah Harvey was wedded to convict Richard Garrett. Small exploratory groups from this settlement surveyed a land route to Western Port and also sailed to the northwest shore of Port Phillip. On this latter journey, a large group of about 200 Aboriginal people came to meet the Britishers with \\"hostile intentions\\", and \\"with the application of fire-arms absolutely necessary to repel them\\", several Aboriginal people were shot. Lack of fresh water and good timber led this first British attempt at settlement in the region later known as Victoria to be abandoned on 27 January 1804. When Collins left Port Phillip, the Calcutta proceeded to Sydney, and the Ocean to Risdon Cove in Tasmania, where they arrived on 15 February 1804. Prior to abandonment, a group of convicts including William Buckley, escaped from the settlement. Buckley took up residence in a cave near Point Lonsdale on the western side of the bay's entrance, The Rip, and later lived with an Aboriginal Australian group for many years, being given up for dead. Port Phillip was then left mostly undisturbed until 1835, when settlers from Tasmania led by John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner (who had been at the Sorrento settlement as a child) established Melbourne on the lower reaches of the Yarra. John Batman encountered William Buckley who then became an important translator in negotiations with the local Aboriginal tribesmen. In 1838 Geelong was founded, and became the main port serving the growing wool industry of the Western District. For a time Geelong rivalled Melbourne as the leading settlement on the bay, but the Gold Rush which began in 1851 gave Melbourne a decisive edge as the largest town in Victoria. Growth and development of Melbourne Beacon Cove beach and apartments in Port Melbourne As Melbourne prospered, its wealthy classes discovered the recreational uses of Port Phillip. Bayside suburbs such as St Kilda and Brighton were established on the east shore of the bay. Later, resorts further south such as Sorrento and Portsea became popular. The more swampy western shores of the bay were not so favoured, and have been used mainly for non-residential purposes such as agriculture, the Point Cook Royal Australian Air Force base and the Werribee Sewage Farm, and significant nature reserves. In recent decades the population along the western side of the bay has grown more rapidly. In the 21st century, property along the Port Phillip coastline continues to be highly sought after. Port Phillip continues to be extensively used for recreational pursuits such as swimming, cycling, boating, and fishing. The bay also features a number of historical walks and fauna reserves. The traditional land owners of the area have also been acknowledged at a number of sites. Geography Port Phillip lies in southern Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula to the southwest and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria and one of the largest inland bays in Australia. The narrow entrance to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. The best time for small craft to enter the Rip is at slack water. Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip Sea Pilots. Work has commenced to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne's docks. The eastern side of the bay is characterised by sandy beaches extending from St Kilda, Sandringham, Beaumaris, Carrum, and down the Mornington Peninsula to Frankston, Safety Beach/Dromana and Rye to Portsea. Longshore drift carries sand from south to north during winter and from north to south during summer. Cliff erosion control has often resulted in sand starvation, necessitating offshore dredging to replenish the beach. On the western side of the bay there is a greater variety of beach types, including both sandy and sandstone rock beaches, seen at Queenscliff, St Leonards, Indented Head, Portarlington, Altona and Geelong's Eastern Beach. Numerous sandbanks and shoals occur in the southern section of the bay, and parts of the South Channel require occasional maintenance dredging. =Climate= The region has an oceanic climate (K√∂ppen Cfb) with warm summers possessing occasional very hot days due to northerly winds and mild winters. Annual rainfall, which is evenly distributed over the year, shows considerable variation due to the Otway Ranges to the southwest: the northwestern shore of the bay is the driest part of southern Victoria and almost approaches a semi-arid climate (BSk) with a mean annual rainfall as low as (comparable to Nhill or Numurkah), whilst the eastern shores less shielded by the Otways receive as much as . Summer temperatures average around during the day and at night, but occasional northerly winds can push temperatures over , whilst in winter a typical day will range from to . =Beaches= Port Phillip as seen from Frankston on the eastern shore of the bay Port Phillip hosts many beaches, most of which are flat, shallow and long, with very small breaks making swimming quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are difficult or impossible, except in extreme weather conditions. However, stand up paddle boarding (SUP), kite surfing and wind surfing are very popular. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay's northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and rocky cliffs can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches. * Major beaches include: St. Kilda Beach, Brighton Beach, Sandringham Beach, Dromana Beach =Rivers and creeks= * Rivers: Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Patterson River, Little River, Werribee River. * Creeks: Kananook Creek, Sweetwater Creek, Cowies Creek, Kororoit Creek, Chinamans Creek. =Islands= Due to its shallow depth, numerous artificial islands and forts have been built, however, despite the depth, it only hosts a few true islands. Many sandy, muddy banks and shallows exist in its southern reaches, such as Mud Islands, but most islands are located in the marshy shallows of Swan Bay. Some of the bay's major islands include: * Swan Island * Mud Islands * Duck Island * South Channel Fort (artificial) * Pope's Eye (artificial) =Surrounding mountains and hills= Arthurs Seat (305 m high) and Dromana Bay in southern Port Phillip Kitesurfing at Rye with Arthurs Seat in the background * Arthurs Seat 314 m * Mount Martha 160 m * Mount Eliza * Olivers Hill * Flinders Peak 364 m =Surrounding lakes= * Albert Park Lake * Cherry Lake * Lake Borrie * Lake Carramar, Lake Illawong and Lake Legana of Patterson Lakes * Lake Connewarre * Lake Victoria * RAAF Lake * Sanctuary Lakes (artificial) * Salt Lagoon Ecology Jellyfish washed up on Port Melbourne beach Blue blubber jellyfish in Port Phillip Jellyfish are a familiar sight in Port Phillip, and its waters are home to species such as Australian fur seals, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, humpback whales, and southern right whales.Fitzgerald E., Jefferies R., 2011 Southern Right Whale ‚Äì Eubalaena australis.

Rogers. His subject was his earliest recollections of an idyllic boyhood spent at Arthur's Seat Run, location of the historic McCrae Homestead on the southern shore of the bay, part of the Mornington Peninsula. In the letters he described in detail the natural history of the area in the 1840s, and the species he particularly remembered 60 years later. In 1939, Charles Daley read an article before the Victorian Historical Society based on these letters, which was published in their magazine in 1940 the year after a large bushfire in January 1939 hastened the disappearance of much of the original surviving wildlife from the area. The names of the species reflect the titles given to them by the original European settlers of the bay.Daley, Charles.

The southern section of the Bay near the Heads is covered by extensive sand banks, known as the \\"Great Sand\\". A shipping channel was dredged in an east-west direction from the Heads to near Arthur's Seat late in the nineteenth century, and maintained ever since. Early shipping used piers at Sandridge (Port Melbourne), but later moved to various wharves along the Yarra River, which make up today's Port of Melbourne. The Melbourne Harbor Trust and Geelong Harbor Trust were responsible for the piers and wharves in their respective cities ‚Äî they are now the government owned Port of Melbourne Corporation and the privately operated GeelongPort. Today, the Port of Melbourne has grown to become Australia's busiest commercial port, serving Australia's second largest city and handling an enormous amount of imports and exports into and out of the country. The Port of Geelong also handles a large volume of dry bulk and oil, while nearby Port of Hastings on Western Port handles steel and oil products. In 2004 the Victorian Government launched the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project to deepen the existing shipping channels and the lower Yarra to accommodate deeper draft vessels. The lower Yarra sediments were identified as likely to be contaminated with toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and were to be contained within a sealed berm clear of the shipping channels south of the Yarra entrance. The vessel chosen for the dredging is the Queen of the Netherlands. 52 environmental groups, recreational fishing groups, and divers' groups formed the \\"Blue Wedges\\" group to oppose the proposed channel deepening and dredging with organised protests carried out, culminating in the group taking action in the Federal Court in January 2008 against the Commonwealth to stop it signing off on the project.The Age Newspaper,Court threat to channel deepening On 15 January 2008 it was announced that their appeal was dismissed,The Age Newspaper,Bay dredge gets go-ahead with dredging starting soon after. The government announced the completion of works in November 2009, ahead of schedule and $200 million under budget. =Shipping channels= * South Channel ‚Äì Extends from the area of the rip in an easterly direction where it terminates off the coast of Arthurs Seat. Vessels with a draught of 14.0m can be navigated through the channel at all tides. This is the main commercial shipping channel in the south of the bay allowing large ships access between the entrance of the bay and its middle regions. * West Channel ‚Äì Extends from the area of the rip, heads towards the north-west and ends off the coast of St Leonards. The depth varies, in May 1998 there was a minimum of 4.1 metres. Non-commercial vessels are still navigated through the channel, however it is no longer used for commercial shipping. *The Rip ‚Äì Also referred to as \\"the heads\\" for shipping purposes, vessels with a draught of 14.0m can be navigated through the Heads during any height of tide.

Many residents of Melbourne holiday on the shorelines of the bay, particularly the Bellarine (South west, near Geelong) and Mornington (south east of Melbourne) Peninsulas, most annually, either camping in tents, caravan or villas in caravan parks, sharing rental houses or staying in holiday homes. Recreation and sport Kitesurfing at St Kilda on Port Phillip, Australia Port Phillip's mostly flat topography and moderate waves make perfect conditions for recreational swimming, kitesurfing, windsurfing, sailing, boating, snorkeling, scuba diving, stand up paddle boarding (SUP) and other sports. Port Phillip is home to 36 Yacht clubs. It also hosts the Melbourne to Hobart and Melbourne to Launceston Yacht Races. Port Phillip is also home to a number of marinas, including large marinas at St Kilda, Geelong and Brighton. For the 1956 Summer Olympics, it hosted the sailing events.1956 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 46-7. Dozens of lifesaving clubs dot Port Phillip, especially on the east coast from Altona to Frankston. These clubs provide volunteer lifesaving services and conduct sporting carnivals. Port Phillip is also known as a temperate water scuba diving destination. The shore dives from beaches and piers around the Bay provide a wide variety of experiences on day and night dives. Boat diving in Port Phillip provides access to a remarkable variety of diving environments including wrecks, reefs, drift dives, scallop dives, seal dives and wall dives. Of particular interest are the five scuttled J-Class World War 1 submarines and the Ships' Graveyard off Torquay. With 3 Marine Sanctuaries and easily accessible piers, Port Phillip is also popular for recreational snorkeling. There are also a number of bike paths, including the Bayside Trail and the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail.

The primary goal of the Regina Manifesto was to eradicate the system of capitalism and replace it with a planned socialist economy. The CCF was a Canadian democratic socialist party founded in 1932 by farmers, workers, and socialist groups against the backdrop of the Great Depression. The manifesto was largely written by members of the League for Social Reconstruction, particularly Frank Underhill and F. R. Scott, and called for \\"a planned and socialized economy in which our natural resources and principal means of production and distribution are owned, controlled and operated by the people\\". Specifically it called for the nationalization of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services. It called for a planned economy and a national banking system that would be \\"removed from the control of private profit-seeking interests.\\" It advocated the ability to organize in trade unions and called for a National Labour Code \\"to secure for the worker maximum income and leisure, insurance covering illness, accident, old age, and unemployment.\\" The Regina Manifesto proposed social service programs such as publicly funded health care, supported peace, promoted co-operative enterprises and vowed that \\"No C.C.F. Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Cooperative Commonwealth.\\" The Regina Manifesto remained the CCF's official programme until 1956 when, in the face of the strong anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War, it was replaced by the more moderate Winnipeg Declaration which substituted Keynesian economics for socialist remedies.

They migrated southward from western Montana into the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in the 17th and 18th centuries,Pritzker 326 and finally into the Southern Plains by the early 19th century. In 1867, the Kiowa were moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Today, they are federally recognized as Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma with headquarters in Carnegie, Oklahoma. , there were 12,000 members.

Name Kiowa call themselves Ka'igwu, C√°uig√πKiowa dictionary or Gaigwu, most given with the meaning \\"Principal People\\". The first part of the name is the element Kae-, C√°ui- or Gai- which means the Kiowa themselves ‚Äì it may derive from the word ka (mother) or from ka-a (a type of spear with feathers along its length). The true origin is lost. Kae-kia means a Kiowa man; Kae-ma is a Kiowa woman. The second element -gua refers to \\"men or people\\",LIVING KIOWA SURVIVAL DICTIONARY so the meaning of the two elements is \\"Kiowa people\\"; to express \\"Principal People\\" (sometimes \\"Chief People\\") or \\"genuine, real or true People\\" in Kiowa is to add the ending -hin. Ancient names were K√∫tj√†u or Kwu- da (\\"emerging\\" or \\"coming out rapidly\\") and Tep-da, relating to the tribal origin myth of a creator pulling people out of a hollow log until a pregnant woman got stuck. Later, they called themselves Kom-pa-bianta for \\"people with large tipi flaps\\", before they met Southern Plains tribes or before they met white men. Another explanation of their name \\"Kiowa\\" originated after their migration through what the Kiowa refer to as \\"The Mountains of the Kiowa\\" (Kaui-kope) in the present eastern edge of Glacier National Park, Montana, just south of the border with Canada. The mountain pass they came through was populated heavily by grizzly bear Kgyi-yo and Blackfoot people. Other tribes who encountered the Kiowa used sign language to describe them, by holding two straight fingers near the lower outside edge of the eye and moving these fingers back past the ear. This corresponded to the ancient Kiowa hairstyle cut horizontally from the lower outside edge of the eyes to the back of their ears. This was a functional practice to keep their hair from getting tangled while they shot an arrow from a bow string. George Catlin painted Kiowa warriors with this hairstyle. For a time, the Kiowa are thought to have shared land, mostly in present-day eastern Colorado, with the Arapaho. An Arapaho name for the Kiowa is \\"creek people\\", and the Arapaho word for \\"creek\\" is koh'owu, which when pronounced carefully has some resemblance to the current name \\"Kiowa\\". For example, the Kiowa are referred to as \\"creek people\\" in an oral narrative recited in 1993 by native Arapaho speaker Paul Moss.Andrew Cowell and Alonzo Moss, Sr., eds. and trans.: Arapaho Historical Traditions, (Winnipeg, 2003: University of Manitoba Press), pp. 194‚Äì195. The stories in this volume are bilingual in Arapaho and English. \\"Kiowa\\" may have been a transliteration by European Americans of a name by which the tribe was known among the Arapaho.

The relationship was first proposed by Smithsonian linguist John P. Harrington in 1910, and was definitively established in 1967. Parker McKenzie, born 1897, was a noted authority on the Kiowa language, learning English only when he began school. He worked with John P. Harrington on the Kiowa language. He went on to discuss the etymology of words and insights of how the Kiowa language changed to incorporate new items of material culture.

Culture  Originally from the Northern Plains and migrating to the Southern Plains, Kiowa society follows bilateral descent, that is, both maternal and paternal lines are significant. They don't have clans but have a complex kinship-based system, and societies based on age and gender. Tipis, conical lodges made from hide or later canvas, provided lightweight, portable housing. They hunted and gathered wild foods and traded with neighboring agrarian tribes for produce. The Kiowa migrated seasonally with the American bison because it was their main food source. They also hunted antelope, deer, turkeys and other wild game. Women collected varieties of wild berries and fruit and processed them with prepared meats to make pemmican. Dogs were used to pull travois and rawhide parfleche that contained camping goods for short moves. The Kiowa tended to stay in areas for long periods of time. When they adopted horse culture, after acquiring horses from Spanish rancherias south of the Rio Grande, the Kiowa revolutionized their lifeways. They had much larger ranges for their seasonal hunting, and horses could carry some of their camping goods. The Kiowa and Plains Apache established a homeland that lay in the Southern Plains adjacent to the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado and western Kansas and the Red River drainage of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma. = Cuisine = Ledger drawing of mounted Kiowa hunters hunting pronghorn antelope with bows and lance, c.1875‚Äì1877. Kiowa hunting elk on horseback, c. 1875‚Äì1877 Elk and Buffalo Grazing among Prairie Flowers 1846‚Äì48, painted by George Catlin in Texas. The Kiowa historically had a nomadic hunter-gatherer society. They shared a similar cuisine with their neighboring Plains tribes, such as the Comanche. The most important food source for the Kiowa and fellow plains nations is the American bison or buffalo. Before the introduction of horses, bison were hunted on foot and required the hunter to get as close as possible to the target before going close to shoot with arrows or use the long lance. Occasionally they wore the skins of wolves or coyotes to hide their approach towards the bison herds. Hunting bison became far easier after the Kiowa acquired horses. Bison were hunted on horseback and the men used bows and arrows to take them down, as well as long lances to pierce the hearts of the animals. The women prepared bison meat in a variety of ways: roasted, boiled, and dried. Dried meat was prepared into pemmican, for sustenance while the people were on the move. Pemmican is made by grinding dried lean meat into a powder, then mixing a near equal weight of melted fat or tallow and sometimes berries; the pemmican was shaped into bars and kept in pouches until ready to eat. Certain parts of the bison were sometimes eaten raw. Other animals hunted included deer, elk, pronghorn, wild mustang, wild turkey, and bears. During times of scarce game, the Kiowa would eat small animals such as lizards, waterfowl, skunks, snakes, and armadillos. They raided ranches for Longhorn cattle and horses to eat during hard times, and horses to acquire for their own use. Men did most of the hunting in Kiowa society. Women were responsible for gathering wild edibles such as berries, tubers, seeds, nuts, vegetables, and wild fruit but could choose to hunt if they wanted to. Plants important to Kiowa cuisine includes pecans, prickly pear, mulberries, persimmons, acorns, plums, and wild onions. They acquired cultivated crops, such as squash, maize, and pumpkin, by trading with and raiding various Indian peoples, such as the people Pawnee, living on the western edge of the great plains. Prior to acquiring metal pots from Europeans, Kiowa cooks boiled meat and vegetables through a process of lining a pit in the earth with animal hides, filling that with water, and adding fire-heated rocks.Rollings (2004), pp. 22-28. =Transportation and dwellings= Four Kiowa tipis with designs, 1904. Top L to R, bison herd and pipe-smoking deer; porcupines; bottom, L to R: arms and legs with pipes and lizard; mythical water monsters. The main form of shelter used by the Kiowa was the tipi or skin lodge. Tipis were made from bison hides shaped and sewn together in a conical shape. Wooden poles called lodge poles from in length are used as support for the lodge. Lodge poles are harvested from red juniper and the lodgepole pine.Wishart, David J.. Encyclopedia of the Great Plains Indians. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2007. 89. Tipis have at least one entrance flap. Smoke flaps were place at the top, so that smoke could escape from the fire pit within. The floor of the tipi was lined with animal pelts and skins for warmth and comfort. The tipi is designed to be warm inside during the cold winter months and cool inside during the warm summer. Tipis are easily collapsed and can be raised in minutes, making it an optimal structure for a nomadic people like the Kiowa and other Plains Indian nations. The poles of the tipi were used to construct a travois during times of travel. Hide paintings often adorn the outside and inside of the tipis, with special meanings attached to certain designs. Ledger drawing of Kiowas engaging in horse mounted warfare with traditional enemy forces, 1875. Before the introduction of the horse to North America, the Kiowa and other plains peoples used domestic dogs to carry and pull their belongings. Tipis and belongings, as well as small children, were carried on travois, a frame structure using the tipi poles and pulled by dogs and later horses. The introduction of the horse to Kiowa society revolutionized their way of life. They acquired horses by raiding rancheros south of the Rio Grande into Mexico, as well as by raiding other Indian peoples who already had horses, such as the Navajo and the various Pueblo people. With the horse, they could transport larger loads, hunt more game over a wider range and more easily, and travel longer and farther. The Kiowa became powerful and skilled mounted warriors who conducted long-distance raids against enemies. The Kiowa were considered among the finest horsemen on the Plains. A man's wealth was measured primarily by the size of his horse herd, with particularly wealthy individuals having herds numbering in the hundreds. Horses were targets of capture during raids. The Kiowa considered it an honor to steal horses from enemies, and such raids often served as a rite of passage for young warriors. They adorned their horses with body paint from the medicine man for ritual and spiritual purposes, such as good fortune and protection during battle. Kiowa horses were also often decorated with beaded masks (sometimes with bison horns attached to the sides) and feathers in their manes. Mules and donkeys were also used as means of transportation and wealth; however, they were not as esteemed. = Sociopolitical organization = The Kiowa had a well structured tribal government like most tribes on the Northern Plains. They had a yearly Sun Dance gathering and an elected head-chief who was considered to be a symbolic leader of the entire nation. Warrior societies and religious societies were important to Kiowa society and carried out specific roles. Chiefs were chosen based on bravery and courage shown in battle as well as intelligence, generosity, experience, communication skills, and kindness to others. The Kiowa believed that the young fearless warrior was ideal. The entire tribe was structured around this individual. The warrior was the ideal to which young men aspired. Because of these factors, the Kiowa was of utmost importance in the history of the Southern Plains.Dick Swift, \\"Introduction to the Study of North American Indians\\", A History and Culture of the Southern Plains Tribes, Carnegie Public Schools, 1972 The women gain prestige through the achievements of their husbands, sons, and fathers, or through their own achievements in the arts. Kiowa women tanned, skin-sewed, painted geometric designs on parfleche and later beaded and quilled hides.The Kiowa, by U.S. Department of the Interior, Southern Plains Indian Museum, 1994 The Kiowa women took care of the camp while the men were away. They gathered and prepared food for winter months, and participated in key ritual events. Kiowa men lived in the families of their wives' extended families. Local groups (j≈çf√†uj≈çg√°u or j≈çd√°u) were led by the j≈çf√†uj≈çq√¨, which merged to become a band (topadoga). These bands were led by a chief, the Topadok'i (‚Ä≤main chief‚Ä≤). The Kiowa had two political subdivisions (particularly with regard to their relationship with the Comanche): *To-kinah-yup or Th√≥q√†hy√≤p /Th√≥q√†hy√≤i (‚Ä≥Northerners‚Ä≥, lit. 'Men of the Cold' or ‚Ä≤Cold People‚Ä≤, 'northern Kiowa', lived along the Arkansas River and the Kansas border, comprising the more numerous northern bands) *S√°lq√°hy√≥p or S√°lq√°hy√≥i (‚Ä≥Southerners‚Ä≥, lit. ‚Ä≤Hot People‚Ä≤, 'southern Kiowa', lived in the Llano Estacado (Staked Plains), Oklahoma Panhandle and Texas Panhandle, allies of the Comanche). As the pressure on Kiowa lands increased in the 1850s, the regional divisions changed. A new regional grouping emerged: * the Gwa-kelega or G√∫h√†lƒìc√°uig√∫ ('Wild Mustang Kiowa' or ‚Ä≤G√∫h√†lƒì Kiowa‚Ä≤, they were named for the large mustang herds in the territory of the Kwahadi (Quohada) Band of the Comanche, this Comanche Band was known to them as G√∫h√†lƒìg√°u ‚Äì ‚Ä≤Wild Mustang People‚Ä≤‚Ä≤, with which they were living in close proximity during the last resistance to white settlement on the Southern Plains). After the death of the high chief Doh√§san in 1866, the Kiowa split politically into a peace faction and a war faction. War-bands and peace-bands developed primarily based on their proximity to Fort Sill (X√≥q√°ud√°uh√°ga ‚Äì ‚Ä≤At Medicine Bluff‚Ä≤, lit. ‚Ä≤Rock Cliff Medicine At Soldiers Collective They Are‚Ä≤) and their degree of interaction.William C. Meadows: Kiowa Ethnogeography, University of Texas Press 2008, , Kiowa Homeland, pages 122 ‚Äì 123 Kiowa bands within the tipi ring during the annual Sun Dance (called Kc-to):Kiowa Ethnohistory and Historical Ethnography *K√¢t√° or Q√°utj√°u ('Biters', lit.

These were traditionally defined as follows: The K√¢t√° had the traditional right (duty or task) to supply the Kiowa during the Sun Dance with enough bison meat and other foods. This band was particularly wealthy in horses, tipis and other goods. The famous Principal Kiowa chiefs Doh√§san (Little Mountain) and Guipago (Lone Wolf) were members of this band. The Kogui were responsible for conducting the war ceremonies during the Sun Dance. There were numerous famous families and leaders known for their military exploits and bravery, such as Ad-da-te (\\"Islandman\\"), Satanta (White Bear), and Kicking Bird, and the war chiefs Big Bow (Zepko-ete) and Stumbling Bear (Set-imkia). The Kaigwu were the guardians of the Sacred or Medicine bundle (Tai-m√©, Taimay) and the holy lance. Therefore, they were respected and enjoyed a special prestige. The Kinep or Khe-ate were often called \\"Sun Dance Shields\\", because during the dance, they observed police duties and ensured security. The chief Woman's Heart (Manyi-ten) belonged to this band. The Semat were allowed to participate equally, but had no specific duties and obligations during the Sun Dance. The Soy-hay-talpup√© were often called Montalyui or K√≥Ã±t√°lyop / K·πìt√°ly√≥p / K·πìt√°ly√¥i (\\"Black Boys\\", Black Boy Band); they were also named after the Kiowa cultural hero S√©nd√® / Sindi and therefore called S√©nd√®iy√≤i (S√©nd√® / Sainday's Children). To this band belonged the medicine man Maman-ti. Like the Semat, they had no specific duties or responsibilities. =Enemies and warrior culture= Ledger drawings by Silver Horn featuring a collection of Kiowa shield designs, 1904. Typical of the plains Indians, the Kiowa were a warrior people. They fought frequently with enemies both neighboring and far beyond their territory. The Kiowa were notable even among plains Indians for their long-distance raids, including raids far south into Mexico and north onto the northern plains. Almost all warfare took place while mounted on horses. Enemies of the Kiowa include the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Navajo, Ute, and occasionally Lakota to the north and west of Kiowa territory. East of Kiowa territory they fought with the Pawnee, Osage, Kickapoo, Kaw, Caddo, Wichita, and Sac and Fox. To the south they fought with the Lipan Apache, Mescalero Apache, and Tonkawa. The Kiowa also came into conflict with Indian nations from the American south and east displaced to Indian Territory during the Indian Removal period including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muskogee, and Chickasaw. Eastern tribes found that Indian Territory, the place they were sent, was already occupied by plains Indians, most notably the Kiowa and Comanche. The Cheyenne and Arapaho would later make peace with the Kiowa and form a powerful alliance with them, the Comanche, and the Plains Apache to fight invading settlers and U.S soldiers, as well as Mexicans and the Mexican Army. Ledger drawing depicting a meeting between a Kiowa‚ÄìComanche war party and a Pawnee war party (right side). Like other plains Indians, the Kiowa had specific warrior societies. Young men who proved their bravery, skill, or displayed their worth in battle were often invited to one of the warrior societies. In addition to warfare, the societies worked to keep peace within the camps and tribe as a whole. There were six warrior societies among the Kiowa.Boyd, 71 The Po-Lanh-Yope (Little Rabbits) was for boys; all young Kiowa boys were enrolled and the group served mostly social and education purposes, involving no violence or combat. The Adle-Tdow-Yope (Young Sheep), Tsain-Tanmo (Horse Headdresses), Tdien-Pei-Gah (Gourd Society), and Ton-Kon-Gah (Black Legs or Leggings), were adult warrior societies. The Koitsenko (Qkoie-Tsain- Gah, Principal Dogs or Real Dogs)Boyd, 73 consisted of the ten most elite warriors of all the Kiowa, who were elected by the members of the other four adult warrior societies. Kiowa warriors used a combination of traditional and nontraditional weapons, including long lances, bows and arrows, tomahawks, knives, and war-clubs, as well as the later acquired rifles, shotguns, revolvers, and cavalry swords. Shields were made from tough bison hide stretched over a wooden frame, or made from the skull of bison, which made a small, strong shield. Shields and weapons were adorned with feathers, furs, and animal parts such as eagle claws for ceremonial purposes. Calendar of 37 months, 1889‚Äì92, kept on a skin by Anko, ca. 1895 =Kiowa calendars= The Kiowa people told ethnologist James Mooney that the first calendar keeper in their tribe was Little Bluff, or Tohausan, who was the principal chief of the tribe from 1833 to 1866. Mooney also worked with two other calendar keepers, Settan, or Little Bear, and Ankopaingyadete, In the Middle of Many Tracks, commonly known as Anko. Other Plains tribes kept pictorial records, known as \\"winter counts\\". The Kiowa calendar system is unique: they recorded two events for each year, offering a finer-grained record and twice as many entries for any given period. Silver Horn (1860‚Äì1940), or Haungooah, was the most highly esteemed artist of the Kiowa tribe in the 19th and 20th centuries, and kept a calendar. He was a respected religious leader in his later years.Greene, Candace S. One Hundred Summers: A Kiowa Calendar Record. Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, 2008. = Funeral practices = In Kiowa tradition, death had strong associations with darks spirits and negative forces, which meant that the death of an individual was seen as a traumatic experience. Fear of ghosts in Kiowa communities stemmed from the belief that spirits commonly resisted the end of their physical life. The spirits were thought to remain around the corpse or its burial place, as well as haunt former living spaces and possessions. Lingering spirits were also believed to help encourage the dying to cross from the physical world to the afterlife. The fear of ghosts can be seen in the way skulls were treated, which was believed to be a source of negative spiritual contamination that invited danger to the living. Due to the fears and risks associated with death, the community‚Äôs reactions were instantaneous and vicious.Opler, Morris E., and William E. Bittle. \\"The Death Practices and Eschatology of the Kiowa Apache\\". Southwestern Journal of Anthropology, vol. 17, no. 4, 1961, pp. 383‚Äì394., doi:10.1086/soutjanth.17.4.3628949. Families and relatives were expected to demonstrate grief through reactions such as wailing, ripping off clothes and shaving of the head. There have also been accounts of self-induced body lacerations and finger joints being cut. In the process of grief, women and the widowed spouse were expected to be more expressive in their mourning.\\"Kiowa - Religion and Expressive Culture\\". Countries and Their Cultures, Every Culture, 2010, www.everyculture.com/North-America/Kiowa- Religion-and-Expressive-Culture.html. The body of the deceased must be washed before burial. The washer, historically a woman, also combs the hair and paints the face of the dead. Once the body has been treated, a burial occurs promptly. When possible, the burial takes place on the same day, unless the death occurs at night. In this case the dead is buried the following morning. A quick burial was believed to reduce the risk of spirits remaining around the burial site. After the burial, most of the belongings of the dead were burned along with their tipi. If their tipi or house was shared with family, the surviving relatives moved into a new house.Fowler, Jess. ‚ÄúJess Fowler.‚Äù Myasd, Funeral Pro Chat, 2015, www.myasd.com/blog/article-toby-blackstar-discusses- funeral-customs-native-american-communities. History 1865 Treaty Map As members of the Kiowa-Tanoan language family, the Kiowa at some distant time likely shared an ethnic origin with the other Amerindian nations of this small language family: Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, and others. By historic times, however, the Kiowa lived in a hunter-gatherer economy unlike the sedentary pueblo societies of the others. The Kiowa also had a complex ceremonial life and developed the 'Winter counts' as calendars. The Kiowa recount their origins as near the Missouri River, and the Black Hills. They knew that they were driven south by pressure from the Sioux. Sitting Bear, Kiowa chief For the earliest recorded ‚Äî and recounted ‚Äî history of the Kiowa, see further below. Guipago, Kiowa chief Satanta, Kiowa chief Following A'date, famous Kiowa leaders were Doh√§san (Tauhawsin, Over-Hanging Butte, alias Little Mountain, alias Little Bluff); Satank (Set-ankea, Sitting Bear), Guipago (Gui-pah-gho, Lone Wolf The Elder, alias Guibayhawgu, Rescued From Wolves), Satanta (Set-tainte, White Bear), Tene-angopte (Kicking Bird), Zepko-ete (Big Bow), Set-imkia (Stumbling Bear), Manyi-ten (Woman's Heart), Napawat (No Mocassin), Mamanti (Walking- above), Tsen-tainte (White Horse), Ado-ete (Big Tree).WARREN WAGONTRAIN RAID  The Handbook of Texas Online Texas State Historical Association (TSHA) Dohasan, who is also known as Touhason, is considered by many to be the greatest Kiowa Chief (1805‚Äì1866), as he unified and ruled the Kiowa for 30 years. He signed several treaties with the United States, including the Fort Atkinson Treaty of July 27, 1852, and the Little Arkansas Treaty of 1865. Guipago became the head chief of the Kiowa when Dohosan (Little Bluff) named him as his successor. Guipago and Satanta, along with old Satank, led the warring faction of the Kiowa nation, while Tene-angopte and Napawat led the peaceful party. In 1871 Satank, Satanta and Big Tree (translated in some documents as Addo-etta) helped lead the Warren Wagon Train Raid. They were arrested by United States soldiers and transported to Jacksboro, Texas. En route, near Fort Sill, Indian Territory, Satank killed a soldier with a knife and was shot by cavalry troops while trying to escape. Satanta and Big Tree were later convicted of murder by a \\"cowboy jury\\". In September 1872, Guipago met with Satanta and Ado-ete, the visit being one of Guipago's conditions for accepting a request to travel to Washington and meet President Grant for peace talks. Guipago eventually got the two captives released in September 1873. Guipago, Satanta, Set-imkia, Zepko-ete, Manyi-ten, Mamanti, Tsen-tainte and Ado-ete led Kiowa warriors during the \\"Buffalo war\\" along the Red River, together with the Comanche allies, in the summer (June‚ÄìSeptember) 1874. They surrendered after the Palo Duro Canyon fight. Tene-angopte had to select 26 Kiowa chiefs and warriors to be deported; Satanta was sent to a prison in Huntsville, Alabama, while Guipago, Manyi-ten, Mamanti, Tsen-tainte, and others were sent to St. Augustine, Florida, at what was then known as Fort Marion. Tene-angopte, damned by the \\"medicine-man\\" Mamanti, died in May 1875; Satanta committed suicide at Huntsville in October 1878. Guipago, having fallen sick with malaria, was jailed in Fort Sill, where he died in 1879. The sculptor of the Indian Head nickel, James Earle Fraser, is reported to have said that Chief Big Tree (Adoeette) was one of his models for the U.S. coin; it was minted from 1913 through 1938.\\"Which Indian Really Modeled?\\" by Robert R. Van Ryzin, Numismatic News, 1990. Big Tree, a Kiowa chief and warrior =Early history and migration south= The Southern Plains territory of the Kiowa Nation at the time of European contact (see text for migrations). Red sandstone cliffs in the Black Hills Wyoming, former Kiowa territory which remains a sacred area to them in modern times. Southern plains of the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle. The Kiowa emerged as a distinct people in their original homeland of the northern Missouri River Basin. Searching for more lands of their own, the Kiowa traveled southeast to the Black Hills in present-day South Dakota and Wyoming around 1650. In the Black Hills region, the Kiowa lived peacefully alongside the Crow Indians, with whom they long maintained a close friendship, organized themselves into 10 bands, and numbered around 3000. Pressure from the Ojibwe in the north woods and edge of the great plains in Minnesota forced the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and later the Sioux westward into Kiowa territory around the Black Hills. The Kiowa were pushed south by the invading Cheyenne who were then pushed westward out of the Black Hills by the Sioux. Eventually the Kiowa obtained a vast territory on the central and southern great plains in western Kansas, eastern Colorado, most of Oklahoma including the panhandle, and the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. In their early history, the Kiowa traveled with dogs pulling their belongings until horses were obtained through trade and raid with the Spanish and other Indian nations in the southwest. In the early spring of 1790 at the place that would become Las Vegas, New Mexico, a Kiowa party led by war leader Guikate, made an offer of peace to a Comanche party while both were visiting the home of a mutual friend of both tribes. This led to a later meeting between Guikate and the head chief of the Nokoni Comanche. The two groups made an alliance to share the same hunting grounds and entered into a mutual defense pact and became the dominant inhabitants of the Southern Plains. From that time on, the Comanche and Kiowa hunted, traveled, and made war together. In addition to the Comanche, the Kiowa formed a very close alliance with the Plains Apache (Kiowa-Apache), with the two nations sharing much of the same culture and participating in each other's annual council meetings and events. The strong alliance of southern plains nations kept the invading Spanish from gaining a strong colonial hold on the southern plains and eventually forced them completely out of the area, pushing them eastward and south past the Rio Grande into present day Mexico. =Indian wars= In closing years of the 18th century and in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Kiowa feared little from European neighbors. Kiowa ranged north of the Wichita Mountains. The Kiowa and Comanche controlled a vast expanse of territory from the Arkansas River to the Brazos River. The enemies of the Kiowa were usually the enemies of the Comanche. To the east there was warfare with the Osage and Pawnee. In the early 19th, the Cheyenne and Arapaho began camping on the Arkansas River and new warfare broke out. In the south of the Kiowa and Comanche were Caddoan speakers, but the Kiowa and Comanche were friendly toward these bands. The Comanche were at war with the Apache of the Rio Grande region. Cut-Throat Massacre, 1833. A picture from the Dohasan winter count. They warred with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, Pawnee, Sac and Fox, and Osages. In summer 1833, the Osage attacked an exposed Kiowa camp near Head Mountain, Oklahoma. The Kiowa lost many aged people, children and women. The heads were cut off and placed in kettles. During this \\"Cut-Throat Massacre\\", the Osage captured the sacred Tai-may doll (the Sun Dance figure of the Kiowa) as well. The Kiowa were unable to perform the Sun Dance until the return of the Tai-may in 1835.Boyd, Maurice (1981): Kiowa Voices. Ceremonial Dance, Ritual and Song. Part I. Fort Worth. Dohasan replaced the old Kiowa chief, since he had failed to anticipate danger.Mooney, James (1898): Calendar History of the Kiowa Indians. Smithsonian Institution. 17th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology. Part I. Washington. The Kiowa traded with the Wichita south along Red River and with Mescalero Apache and New Mexicans to the southwest. After 1840 they and their former enemies the Cheyenne, as well as their allies the Comanche and the Apache, fought and raided the Eastern natives moving into the Indian Territory.Kiowa History by Evans R. Satepauhoodle, TU, 2004 From 1821 until 1870 the Kiowa joined the Comanche in raids, primarily to obtain livestock, that extended deep into Mexico and caused the death of thousands of people.Smith, Ralph A. \\"The Comanches' Foreign War.\\" Great Plains Journal. Vol. 24‚Äì25, 1985‚Äì1986, p. 21 =Transition period= Ma-may-dayte The years from 1873 to 1878 marked a drastic change in Kiowa lifestyle. In June 1874, the Kiowa, along with a group of Comanche and Cheyenne warriors, made their last protest against the invasion of white men at the Battle of Adobe Walls in Texas, which proved futile. In 1877, the first homes were constructed for the Indian chiefs and a plan was initiated to employ Indians at the Agency. Thirty Indians were hired to form the first police force on the Reservation.The Kiowa, U.S. Department of the Interior, Indian Arts and Crafts Board, Southern Plains Indian Museum and Crafts Center The Kiowa agreed to settle on a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Some bands of Kiowas remained at large until 1875. Some of the Lipan Apache and Mescalero Apache bands with some Comanche in their company held out in northern Mexico until the early 1880s, when Mexican and U.S. Army forces drove them onto reservations or into extinction. By the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, the Kiowas settled in Western Oklahoma and Kansas.Swift, Dick. 1972. They were forced to move south of the Washita River to the Red River and Western Oklahoma with the Comanches and the Kiowa Apache Tribe. The transition from the free life of Plains people to a restricted life of the reservation was more difficult for some families than others. =Reservation period= The reservation period lasted from 1868 to 1906. In 1873, the first school among the Kiowa was established by Quaker Thomas C. Battey. In 1877, the federal government built the first homes for the Indian chiefs and initiated a plan to employ Indians. 30 Indians were hired to form the first police force on the reservation. In 1879, the agency was moved from Ft. Sill to Anadarko.The Kiowa by U.S. Department of the Interior, Southern Plains Indian Museum, 1994. The 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.Texas Beyond History ‚Äì The Passing of the Indian Era An agreement made with the Cherokee Commission signed by 456 adult male Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa-Apache on Sept. 28, 1892, cleared the way for the opening of the country to white settlers. The agreement provided for an allotment of to every individual in the tribes and for the sale of the reservation lands () to the United States ‚Äì was to go into effect immediately upon ratification by Congress, even though the Medicine Lodge treaty of 1867 had guaranteed Indian possession of the reservation until 1898. The Indian signers wanted their names stricken but it was too late. A'piatan, as the leader, went to Washington to protest. Chief Lone Wolf (the Younger) immediately file proceedings against the act in the Supreme Court, but the Court decided against him on June 26, 1901.Anadarko Daily News, Aug. 3 & 4, 1996 Agents were assigned to the Kiowa people. =Modern period= Since 1968, the Kiowa have been governed by the Kiowa Tribal Council, which presides over business related to health, education, and economic and industrial development programs.B.R. Kracht by Oklahoma Historical Society On March 13, 1970, the constitution and bylaws of the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma were drafted, and Kiowa voters ratified them on May 23, 1970. The current constitution was approved in 2017. In 1998, a significant legal development occurred with a landmark decision. In Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc., the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Indian tribes retain their sovereign immunity as nations from private suits without their consent, even in off-reservation transactions where they do not waive that immunity.Walter Echo-Hawk, NARF Annual Report, 1998 , more than 4,000 of 12,500 enrolled Kiowa lived near the towns of Anadarko, Fort Cobb, and Carnegie, in Caddo and Kiowa counties, Oklahoma. Kiowa also reside in urban and suburban communities throughout the United States, having moved to areas with more jobs. Each year Kiowa veterans commemorate the warlike spirit of the 19th-century leaders with dances performed by the Kiowa Gourd Clan and Kiowa Black Leggings Warrior Society. Kiowa cultural identity and pride is apparent in their expressive culture and strong influence on the Gourd Dance and southern plains art. =Longhorn Mountain controversy= Longhorn Mountain near Carnegie, Oklahoma, a sacred site and source of cedar for the Kiowa, was leased to rock-crushing company Stewart Stone, Inc., of Cushing, Oklahoma, which announced intentions to begin to mine gravel in 2013. Humanities Wichita, and Josephine Parker, Kiowa, with their beadwork Documentation of the history and development of contemporary Kiowa art formulates one of the most unusual records in Native American culture. As early as 1891, Kiowa artists were being commissioned to produce works for display at international expositions. The \\"Kiowa Six\\" were some of the earliest Native Americans to receive international recognition for their work in the fine art world. They influenced generations of Indian artists among the Kiowa, and other Plains tribes. Traditional craft skills are not lost among the Kiowa people today and the talented fine arts and crafts produced by Kiowa Indians helped the Oklahoma Indian Arts and Crafts Cooperative flourish over its 20-year existence. =Ledger art and hide painting= Early Kiowa ledger artists were those held in captivity by the U.S. Army at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida (1875‚Äì1878), at the conclusion of the Red River War, which also is known as the Southern Plains Indian War.Southern Plains Indian war Ledger art emerges from the Plains hide painting tradition. These Fort Marion artists include Kiowas Etadleuh Doanmoe and Zotom, who was a prolific artist who chronicled his experiences before and after becoming a captive at the fort. After his release from Fort Marion, Paul Zom-tiam (Zonetime, Koba) studied theology from 1878 until 1881, when he was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal church.Viola 16 A Kiowa ledger drawing possibly depicting the Buffalo Wallow battle in 1874, a fight between Southern Plains Indians and the U.S. Army during the Red River War. = Kiowa Six = Following in Silver Horn's footsteps were the Kiowa Six, or, as they have been known in the past, the Kiowa Five. They are Spencer Asah, James Auchiah, Jack Hokeah, Stephen Mopope, Lois Smoky Kaulaity, and Monroe Tsatoke.Jacobson House Native Art Center: About the Kiowa Six Jacobson House Native Art Center. (retrieved 21 July 2020) Coming from the area around Anadarko, Oklahoma, these artists studied at the University of Oklahoma. Lois Smoky left the group in 1927, but James Auchiah took her place in the group. The Kiowa Six gained international recognition as fine artists by exhibiting their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in Czechoslovakia and then participated in the Venice Biennale in 1932.Dunn 240 =Painters and sculptors= Besides the Kiowa Six and Silver Horn, Kiowa painters active in the 20th and 21st centuries include Sharron Ahtone Harjo, Homer Buffalo, Charley Oheltoint, Michael C.

It was directed by Martin Campbell and is the first in the series not to utilize any story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent an ex-MI6 agent, gone rogue, from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown. The film was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton resigned from the role of James Bond and was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. M was also recast, with actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, with Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond; Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his role, as Q. It was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot. Principal photography for GoldenEye took place in the UK, Russia, Monte Carlo and Puerto Rico; it was the inaugural film production to be shot at Leavesden Studios. The first Bond film to use computer generated imagery, GoldenEye was also the final film of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings's career, and was dedicated to his memory. The film accumulated a worldwide gross of over US$350 million, considerably better than Dalton's films, without taking inflation into account. It received positive reviews, with critics viewing Brosnan as a definite improvement over his predecessor. It also received award nominations for \\"Best Achievement in Special Effects\\" and \\"Best Sound\\" from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts. The name \\"GoldenEye\\" pays homage to James Bond's creator, Ian Fleming. While working for British Naval Intelligence as a lieutenant commander, Fleming liaised with the Naval Intelligence Division to monitor developments in Spain after the Spanish Civil War, in an operation codenamed Operation Goldeneye. Fleming used the name of this operation for his estate in Oracabessa, Jamaica. Plot In 1986, MI6 agents James Bond and Alec Trevelyan infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility in Arkhangelsk. While Trevelyan is caught and killed by Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, the facility's commanding officer, Bond manages to destroy the site before escaping. While undergoing an assessment nine years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Bond attempts to prevent Xenia Onatopp, a member of the Janus crime syndicate, from stealing a Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter during a military demonstration in Monte Carlo, but is unable to prevent the theft. Returning to London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring an incident in Severnaya, Siberia, after the stolen helicopter turns up at a radar facility there. An electromagnetic pulse blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and Russian fighter aircraft, while knocking out all satellite systems in orbit above. The newly appointed M assigns Bond to investigate, after it is determined the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a nuclear electromagnetic pulse space-based weapon, codenamed \\"GoldenEye\\". Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects Ourumov, now a general, had involvement due to the weapon system requiring high-level military access. Travelling to Saint Petersburg, Bond is advised by his CIA contact Jack Wade to meet former KGB agent-turned-gangster Valentin Zukovsky and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan, having faked his death at Arkhangelsk, and learns he is descended from the Cossacks who were repatriated to the Soviet Union after collaboration with the Axis powers during World War II. Learning that Trevelyan seeks revenge against Britain for betraying his people, Bond is sedated before he can kill him, and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova, a survivor of the Severnaya attack. Despite escaping before the helicopter's destruction, the pair are captured by Russian soldiers and taken before Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin for interrogation. The angry confrontation between the men leads Natalya to prove Ourumov's involvement in the use of GoldenEye, revealing that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko survived along with her, and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov arrives and kills him. Bond escapes, pursuing after him in a tank to rescue Natalya. The chase leads to a missile train used by Janus, in which Bond kills Ourumov, before escaping from the train with Natalya before Trevelyan destroys it. Bond and Natalya travel to Cuba, after Boris is traced to a location within the island's jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp attacks them after they crash land, but Bond kills her during the fight. The pair soon uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish, and proceed to infiltrate it. Bond is captured while trying to rig explosives to destroy the base, and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to use GoldenEye to devastate London in order to conceal the theft of financial records from the Bank of England. While Natalya is captured as well, she manages to hack into the satellite and reprogram it to initiate atmospheric re-entry and thus destroy itself. When Boris loses his cool trying to undo her programming, Bond uses the moment to trigger a grenade, concealed in a pen, to allow him and Natalya to escape. To prevent Boris regaining control of the satellite, Bond proceeds to sabotage the dish's antennae by jamming its gears. Trevelyan tries to stop him, and the ensuing fight between the two culminates in him being dangled below the antennae. When asked who his death is for, Bond admits it is for himself, before letting Trevelyan plummet to his death. Natalya soon rescues him in a commandeered helicopter, moments before the antennae malfunctions and explodes, destroying the base and killing its personnel, with Trevelyan killed by falling debris, and Boris killed by ruptured liquid nitrogen canisters. After landing somewhere safe, the pair prepare to enjoy some solitude together, but are interrupted by the arrival of Wade and a team of U.S. Marines, who escort them to Guantanamo base.

Production =Prelude= Following the release of Licence to Kill in July 1989, pre-production work for the seventeenth film in the James Bond series, the third to star Timothy Dalton (fulfilling his three-film contract), began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured on the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, The Sunday Times reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with writer Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts of all but three Bond films so far, and director John Glen, responsible for the previous five instalments of the series. Broccoli listed among the possible directors John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, and John Byrum. Broccoli's stepson Michael G. Wilson contributed a script, and Wiseguy co- producer Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. was hired to rewrite. Production was set to start in 1990 in Hong Kong, for a release in late 1991. The film would have been an adaptation of Fleming's short story \\"The Property of a Lady\\". It would have featured a terrorist attack on a British nuclear facility in Scotland threatening to cause World War III, Bond traveling to East Asia to investigate corrupt businessman Sir Henry Lee Ching along with jewel thief Connie Webb, and Bond fighting his former mentor Denholm Crisp. It also would have featured the Chinese Ministry of State Security. Dalton declared in a 2010 interview that the script was ready and \\"we were talking directors\\" before the project entered development hell caused by legal problems between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, parent company of the series' distributor United Artists, and Broccoli's Danjaq, owners of the Bond film rights. In 1990, MGM/UA was to be sold for $1.5 billion to Qintex, an Australian-American financial services company that had begun making television broadcast and entertainment purchases. When Qintex couldn't provide a $50 million letter of credit, the deal fell apart. A French company called Path√© Entertainment (unrelated to the French studio Path√©) quickly moved in to buy MGM/UA for $1.2 billion and merged the companies to create MGM-Path√© Communications. Path√© CEO Giancarlo Parretti intended to sell off the distribution rights of the studio's catalogue so he could collect advance payments to finance the buyout. This included international broadcasting rights to the 007 library at cut-rate prices, leading Danjaq to sue, alleging the licensing violated the Bond distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962, while denying Danjaq a share of the profits. Countersuits were filed. When asked what he would do following resolution of the lawsuits, Dalton told Broccoli that it was unlikely that he would continue in the role. Paretti's behavior led to the bankruptcy of MGM- Path√© and additional lawsuits eventually resulted in a foreclosure by financial backer Cr√©dit Lyonnais in 1992. The Bond rights lawsuits were settled in December 1992, and the renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, now run by a Cr√©dit Lyonnais subsidiary, began to explore further development of Bond 17 with Danjaq in 1993. Dalton was still Broccoli's choice to play Bond, but the star's original seven-year contract with Danjaq expired in 1993. Dalton has stated that the delay of his third film effectively ended the contract in 1990. =Pre-production and writing= In May 1993, MGM announced a seventeenth James Bond film was back in the works, to be based on a screenplay by Michael France. With Broccoli's health deteriorating (he died seven months after the release of GoldenEye), his daughter Barbara Broccoli described him as taking \\"a bit of a back seat\\" in the film's production. Barbara and Michael G. Wilson took the lead roles in production while Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of GoldenEye as a consulting producer, credited as \\"presenter\\". Broccoli reached out to Dalton to ask again if he would come back and now found Dalton open to the idea. In August 1993, France had turned in his first draft, and continued to work on the script. In an interview around the same time, Dalton stated that production was set to begin in January or February 1994. In further discussion with Broccoli, Dalton expressed excitement over taking the best elements of his previous two films and combining them as a basis for one final film. Broccoli stressed that, after the long gap without a film, Dalton could not come back and just do a single film but needed to return for multiple films. Despite France's screenplay being completed by January, production was pushed back with no concrete start. In April 1994, Dalton officially resigned from the role. In a 2014 interview, Dalton revealed that he agreed with Broccoli's expectation but could not commit to appearing in four or five more films. GoldenEye was Pierce Brosnan's first appearance as Bond Further work was done on the screenplay throughout 1994. Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rewrite France's script. Caine kept many of France's ideas but added the prologue prior to the credits. Kevin Wade polished the script and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created. While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title GoldenEye traces its origins to the name of Fleming's Jamaican estate where he wrote the Bond novels. Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate, including Carson McCullers' Reflections in a Golden Eye and Operation Goldeneye, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during Second World War in case of a Nazi invasion through Spain. Although released only six years after Licence to Kill, world politics had changed dramatically in the interim. GoldenEye was the first James Bond film to be produced since the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War, and there was doubt over the character's relevance in the modern world. Some in the film industry felt it would be \\"futile\\" for the Bond series to make a comeback, and that it was best left as \\"an icon of the past\\". The producers even thought of new concepts for the series, such as a period piece set in the 1960s, a female 007, or a black James Bond. Ultimately, they chose to return to the basics of the series, not following the sensitive and caring Bond of the Dalton films or the political correctness that started to permeate the decade. The film came to be seen as a successful revitalisation, and it effectively adapted the series for the 1990s. One of GoldenEyes innovations includes the casting of a female M. In the film, the new M quickly establishes her authority, remarking that Bond is a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\\" and a \\"relic of the Cold War\\". This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton's Bond from 1989. =Casting= To replace Dalton, the producers chose Pierce Brosnan, who had been prevented from succeeding Roger Moore in 1986 because of his contract to star in Remington Steele. He was introduced to the public at a press conference in June 1994. Before negotiating with Brosnan, Mel Gibson, Hugh Grant, and Liam Neeson passed on the role. Paul McGann was the studio's original choice for it. He would have been cast as Bond only if Brosnan had turned down the role. Brosnan was paid $1.2 million for the film, out of a total budget of $60 million. Judi Dench, an English actress, was cast as M replacing Robert Brown, making this the first film of the series featuring a female M. The decision is widely believed to have been inspired by Stella Rimington having become head of MI5 in 1992. The character of Alec Trevelyan was originally scripted as \\"Augustus Trevelyan\\" and envisaged as an older character and a mentor figure to Bond. Anthony Hopkins and Alan Rickman were reportedly sought for the role but both turned it down. Sean Bean was subsequently cast and the character was rewritten as Bond's peer. John Woo was approached as the director, and turned down the opportunity, but said he was honored by the offer. The producers then chose New Zealander Martin Campbell as the director. Brosnan later described Campbell as \\"warrior-like in his take on the piece\\" and that \\"there was a huge passion there on both our parts\\". =Filming= The film's climactic scenes were filmed at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto RicoPrincipal photography for the film began on 16 January 1995 and continued until 2 June. The producers were unable to film at Pinewood Studios, the usual location for Bond films, because it had been reserved for First Knight. Instead, an old Rolls-Royce factory at Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire was converted into a new studio, dubbed Leavesden Studios. This process is shown on the 2006 DVD's special features. The bungee jump was filmed at the Contra Dam (also known as the Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter's demonstration were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in St. Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M's office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London ‚Äì the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport ‚Äì to reduce expenses and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards. The French Navy provided full use of the frigate FS La Fayette and their newest helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger, to the film's production team. The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for it. However, the producers had a dispute with the French Ministry of Defence over Brosnan's opposition to French nuclear weapons testing and his involvement with Greenpeace; as a result, the French premiere of the film was cancelled. The sequences involving the armoured train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, near Peterborough in the UK. The train was composed of a British Rail Class 20 diesel-electric locomotive and a pair of BR Mk 1 coaches, all three heavily disguised to resemble a Soviet armoured train. =Effects= GoldenEye's opening title sequence featured a woman destroying the hammer and sickle. The film was the last one of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings, to whom it was dedicated. Meddings' major contribution was miniatures. It was also the first Bond film to use computer-generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus' train crashes into the tank, and the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings' team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain. Stunt car coordinator R√©my Julienne described the car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between \\"a perfectly shaped, old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar.\\" The stunt had to be meticulously planned as the cars are vastly different. Nails had to be attached to the F355 tyres to make it skid, and during one take of the sliding vehicles, the two cars collided. The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase, which took around six weeks to film, partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly on the old de Havilland runway at Leavesden. A Russian T-54/T-55 tank, on loan from the East England Military Museum, was modified with the addition of fake explosive reactive armour panels. To avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-54/55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank. The T-55 tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airfield, where the East England Military Museum is based. For the confrontation between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell decided to take inspiration from Bond's fight with Red Grant in From Russia with Love. Brosnan and Bean did all the stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier. The opening bungee jump at Arkhangelsk, shot at the Contra Dam in Switzerland and performed by Wayne Michaels, was voted the best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll, and set a record for the highest bungee jump off a fixed structure. The ending of the pre-credits sequence with Bond jumping after the aeroplane features Jacques Malnuit riding the motorcycle to the edge and jumping, and B.J. Worth diving after the plane ‚Äì which was a working aircraft, with Worth adding that part of the difficulty of the stunt was the kerosene striking his face. The fall of Communism in Russia is the main focus of the opening titles, designed by Daniel Kleinman (who took over from Maurice Binder after his death in 1991). They show the collapse and destruction of several structures associated with the Soviet Union, such as the red star, statues of Communist leaders‚Äînotably Joseph Stalin‚Äîand the hammer and sickle. In an interview, Kleinman said they were meant to be \\"a kind of story telling sequence\\" showing that \\"what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down\\". According to producer Michael G. Wilson, some Communist parties protested against \\"Socialist symbols being destroyed not by governments, but by bikini-clad women\\", especially certain Indian Communist parties, which threatened to boycott the film. =Product placement= The film was the first one bound by BMW's three-picture deal, so the producers were offered BMW's latest roadster, the BMW Z3. It was featured in the film months before its release, and a limited edition \\"007 model\\" sold out within a day of being available to order. As part of the car's marketing strategy, several Z3's were used to drive journalists from a complimentary meal at the Rainbow Room restaurant to its premiere at Radio City Music Hall. For the film, a convertible Z3 is equipped with the usual Q refinements, including a self-destruct feature and Stinger missiles behind the headlights. The Z3 does not have much screen time and none of the gadgets are used, which Martin Campbell attributed to the deal with BMW coming in the last stages of production. The Z3's appearance in the film is thought to be the most successful promotion through product placement in 1995. Ten years later, The Hollywood Reporter listed it as one of the most successful product placements in recent years. The article quoted Mary Lou Galician, head of media analysis and criticism at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, as saying that the news coverage of Bond's switch from Aston Martin to BMW \\"generated hundreds of millions of dollars of media exposure for the movie and all of its marketing partners.\\" In addition, all computers in the film were provided by IBM, and in some scenes (such as the pen grenade scene towards the end), the OS/2 Warp splash screen can be seen on computer monitors. A modified Omega Seamaster Quartz Professional watch features as a major plot device several times in the film. It is shown to contain a remote detonator and a laser. This was the first time Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega, and he has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production.\\"Ambassadors: James Bond \\", Omega SA, 29 March 2004 (Retrieved 21 February 2007). =Music= The theme song, \\"GoldenEye\\", was written by Bono and the Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. As the producers did not collaborate with Bono or the Edge, the film score did not incorporate any of the theme song's melodies, as was the case in previous James Bond films. Swedish group Ace of Base had also written a proposed theme song, but label Arista Records pulled the band out of the project fearing the negative impact in case the film flopped. The song was then rewritten as their single \\"The Juvenile\\". The soundtrack was composed and performed by √âric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John Barry said that despite an offer by Barbara Broccoli, he turned it down. Serra's score has been criticised: Richard von Busack, in Metro, wrote that it was \\"more appropriate for a ride on an elevator than a ride on a roller coaster\\", and Filmtracks said Serra \\"failed completely in his attempt to tie GoldenEye to the franchise's past.\\" The end credits song, Serra's \\"The Experience of Love\\", was based on a short cue Serra had originally written for Luc Besson's L√©on one year earlier. Later John Altman provided the music for the tank chase in St. Petersburg. Serra's original track for that sequence can still be found on the soundtrack as \\"A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg\\". Serra composed and performed a number of synthesiser tracks, including the version of the \\"James Bond Theme\\" that plays during the gun barrel sequence, while Altman and David Arch provided the more traditional symphonic music. Release and reception GoldenEye premiered on 13 November 1995, at Radio City Music Hall, and went on general release in the United States on 17 November 1995. The UK premiere, attended by Prince Charles, followed on 21 November at the Odeon Leicester Square, with general release three days later. The film also had the German premiere on 5 December, at which Brosnan was present, at Math√§ser-Filmpalast (de) in Munich, with general release on December 28; and the Swedish premiere on 8 December, attended by Brosnan and Scorupco, at Rigoletto (sv) in Stockholm, with general release on the same day. The after-party took place at Stockholm's Grand H√¥tel. Brosnan boycotted the French premiere to support Greenpeace's protest against the French nuclear testing program. The film earned over $26 million during its opening across 2,667 cinemas in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, it grossed a record $5.5 million for a non-holiday weekend from 448 theatres and was the third biggest in history behind Jurassic Park and Batman Forever. It had the fourth-highest worldwide gross of all films in 1995, and was the most successful Bond film since Moonraker, taking inflation into account. The film was edited to be guaranteed a PG-13 rating from the MPAA and a 12 rating from the BBFC. The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan's head when he is shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral's death, extra footage of Onatopp's death, and Bond knocking her out with a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was remastered and re-edited for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the UK rating to be changed to 15 and the IFCO rating to be changed to 12. However, the original MPAA edits still remain. =Reviews= The critical reception of the film was mostly positive. Film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes holds it at a 78% approval rating. Its consensus states: \\"The first and best Pierce Brosnan Bond film, GoldenEye brings the series into a more modern context, and the result is a 007 entry that's high-tech, action- packed, and urbane.\\" A similar site, Metacritic, holds it at 65%. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A-\\" on an A+ to F scale. In the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said Brosnan's Bond was \\"somehow more sensitive, more vulnerable, more psychologically complete\\" than the previous ones, also commenting on Bond's \\"loss of innocence\\" since previous films. James Berardinelli described Brosnan as \\"a decided improvement over his immediate predecessor\\" with a \\"flair for wit to go along with his natural charm\\", but added that \\"fully one-quarter of Goldeneye is momentum-killing padding.\\" Several reviewers lauded M's appraisal of Bond as a \\"sexist, misogynist dinosaur\\", with Todd McCarthy in Variety saying the film \\"breathes fresh creative and commercial life\\" into the series. John Puccio of DVD Town said that it was \\"an eye- and ear-pleasing, action- packed entry in the Bond series\\" and that the film gave Bond \\"a bit of humanity, too\\". Ian Nathan of Empire said that it \\"revamps that indomitable British spirit\\" and that the Die Hard movies \\"don't even come close to 007\\". Tom Sonne of the Sunday Times considered it the best Bond film since The Spy Who Loved Me. Jose Arroyo of Sight & Sound considered the greatest success of it was in modernising the series. The film was also ranked high in Bond- related lists. IGN chose it as the fifth-best movie, while Entertainment Weekly ranked it eighth, and Norman Wilner of MSN as ninth. EW also voted Xenia Onatopp as the sixth-most memorable Bond girl, while IGN ranked Natalya as seventh in a similar list. However, the film received several negative reviews. Richard Schickel of Time wrote that after \\"a third of a century's hard use\\", Bond's conventions survived on \\"wobbly knees\\", while in Entertainment Weekly, Owen Gleiberman thought the series had \\"entered a near- terminal state of exhaustion.\\" Dragan Antulov said that the film had a predictable series of scenes, and Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times said that it was \\"a middle-aged entity anxious to appear trendy at all costs\\". David Eimer of Premiere wrote that \\"the trademark humour is in short supply\\" and that \\"Goldeneye isn't classic Bond by any stretch of the imagination.\\" Madeleine Williams said that \\"there are plenty of stunts and explosions to take your mind off the plot.\\" =Awards= The film was nominated for two BAFTAs‚ÄîBest Sound and Special Visual Effects‚Äîin 1996, but lost to Braveheart and Apollo 13, respectively. √âric Serra won a BMI Film Award for the soundtrack, and it also earned nominations for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film and Actor at the 22nd Saturn Awards, and Best Fight at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards. Appearances in other media The film was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows its storyline, but Gardner added a violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that would be retained and expanded upon in the video game GoldenEye 007. In late 1995, Topps Comics began publishing a three-issue comic book adaptation of the film. The script was adapted by Don McGregor with art by Rick Magyar. The first issue carried a January 1996 cover date. For unknown reasons, Topps cancelled the entire adaptation after the first issue had been published, and to date the adaptation has not been released in its entirety. The film was the basis for GoldenEye 007, a video game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare (known at the time as Rareware) and published by Nintendo. It was praised by critics and in January 2000, readers of the British video game magazine Computer and Video Games listed it in first place in a list of \\"the hundred greatest video games\\". In Edge's 10th anniversary issue in 2003, the game was included as one of their top ten shooters of all time. It is based upon the film, but many of the missions were extended or modified. The game was modified into a racing game intended to be released for the Virtual Boy console. However, it was cancelled before release. In 2004, Electronic Arts released GoldenEye: Rogue Agent, the first game of the James Bond series in which the player does not take on the role of Bond. Instead, the protagonist is an aspiring Double-0 agent Jonathan Hunter, known by his codename \\"GoldenEye\\" recruited by a villain of the Bond universe, Auric Goldfinger. Except for the appearance of Xenia Onatopp, it was unrelated to the film, and was released to mediocre reviews. It was excoriated by several critics including Eric Qualls for using the name \\"GoldenEye\\" as an attempt to ride on the success of Rare's game. In 2010, an independent development team released GoldenEye: Source, a multiplayer only total conversion mod developed using Valve's Source engine. Nintendo announced a remake of the original GoldenEye 007 at their E3 press conference on 15 June 2010. It is a modernised retelling of the original movie's story, with Daniel Craig playing the role of Bond. Bruce Feirstein returned to write a modernised version of the script, while Nicole Scherzinger covered the theme song. It was developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Wii and Nintendo DS and was released in November 2010. Both Wii and DS versions bear little to no resemblance to the locations and weapons of the original N64 release. In 2011, the game was ported to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the name GoldenEye 007: Reloaded. Legacy The malware Petya (also known as \\"GoldenEye\\") is a reference to the film. A Twitter account, suspected by the German newspaper Heise Online to belong to the malware author, used an image of Boris Grishenko as their avatar.

He is considered the godfather of the charismatic movement and was one of the most recognized preachers in the US at the height of his fame. He founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University. As one of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, his preaching emphasized seed- faith. His ministries reached millions of followers worldwide spanning a period of over six decades. His healing ministry and bringing American Pentecostalism into the mainstream had the most impact, but he also pioneered televangelism and laid the foundations of the prosperity gospel and abundant life teachings. The breadth and style of his ministry, including his widely publicized funding appeals, made him a consistent subject of contention among critics and supporters. Early life Granville Oral Roberts was born on January 24, 1918, in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts (1881-1967) and Claudia Priscilla Roberts (n√©e Irwin) (1885-1974). According to an interview on Larry King Live, Roberts was of Cherokee descent. Roberts was a card-carrying member of the Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma. Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis at age 17. After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University. In 1938, he married a preacher's daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock. Roberts became a traveling faith healer after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a TIME Magazine profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent \\"that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs\\". Ministry and university In 1945, Roberts resigned his pastorate in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to hold revivals in the area and attend Oklahoma Baptist. But in the late summer of 1945, while preaching in a North Carolina camp meeting, Roberts was asked by Robert E. \\"Daddy\\" Lee of Toccoa, Georgia, to consider becoming pastor of his small, eighty-member church. Roberts suggested they pray about it, and unexpectedly, decided to accept. By the end of the year, Roberts resigned and moved back to Shawnee. Apparently, the Georgia conference of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church frowned on having a minister from outside its conference as pastor. Short though it was, the Toccoa detour had a lasting effect on Roberts and his family. It was there that their daughter Rebecca, then five years old, first met her future husband, Marshall. There were also reportedly two instances of healing, which Roberts would later look back on as his first realization \\"that I was approaching 'my hour'.\\" 1947 was a turning point. Up until that time, Roberts struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma. But at the age of 29, Roberts said, he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the Third Epistle of John where verse two read: \\"I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.\\" The next day, he said, he bought a Buick and God appeared, directing him to heal the sick. Roberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the Pentecostal Holiness Church to found Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA). He conducted evangelistic and faith healing crusades across the United States and around the world, claiming he could raise the dead.\\"Oral Roberts Tells Conference He Has Raised People From the Dead\\", New York Times, June 27, 1987\\"I've Raised People from the Dead, Oral Roberts tells 5,000 in Tulsa,\\" The Pittsburgh Press, June 26, 1987 In November 1947, he started Healing Waters, a monthly magazine as a means to promote his meetings.Harrell, Jr., David Edwin (1985). Oral Roberts: An American Life. Bloomington, Indiana: Indiana University Press. p. 112. Thousands of sick people waited in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people. In January 1955, Oral Roberts held a salvation and healing campaign in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was an era of apartheid. He was bitterly assailed by the Sunday Express for the hysteria and traffic jams of 20,000 people that packed big Wembley stadium and playing field. Other newspapers reported on the healings and 25,000 people saved. Roberts left behind a residual campaign fund in South Africa of $37,000 less expenses with the hope that \\"his campaign will save 100,000 during the coming year\\". Three of the four sponsoring churches were Pentecostal, including Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) and the Assemblies of God - White Group (AG). The campaign committee was all white Afrikaaners missionaries and ministers, H.R. Carter, D.D. Freeman, A.J. Schoeman (head of AFM), and W.F. Mullan (head of AG). The campaign committee had plans to use the Oral Roberts' 100,000 Souls for Africa Campaign residual fund to hold revivals in 1955 to win souls for Christ, both Afrikaans (white) and Africans (black). The campaign committee sponsored a young evangelist from the U.S.A. Emanuele Cannistraci, and paid for his revivals in Johannesburg at the Fairview Assemblies Hall and a portion of Bethshan Tabernacle's costs for Cannistraci's revival in Durban South Africa, a congregation of mixed race.Lephoko, Dan S.B.. \\"Nicholas Bhekinkosi Hepworth Bhengu's Lasting Legacy.\\" \\"World's Best Black Soul Crusader\\".

(1955) (received from Langeland-Hansen, F. in Gateway's Archives) Cannistraci's photos, including of two deaf and dumb brothers healed during the revival, were published in Oral Roberts' America's Healing Magazine. He also ran direct mail campaigns of seed-faith, which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This included not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on south of Tulsa valued at $500 million. Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the Abundant Life Prayer Group (ALPG), was founded in 1958. The Praying Hands, on the ORU campus in Tulsa, Oklahoma In 1963, he founded Oral Roberts University (ORU) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stating he was obeying a command from God. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to drink, smoke, or engage in premarital sexual activities. The Prayer Tower, opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus. From left: Young Brown, Jack Moore, William Branham, Oral Roberts, Gordon Lindsay; photo taken at Kansas City in 1948 Roberts was a pioneer televangelist, and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947, and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954. His television ministry continued with The Abundant Life program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded Golden Eagle Broadcasting. On March 17, 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Dr. Finis Crutchfield, then pastor. The United Methodist Church offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostal Holiness Church had. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity. Before Roberts' switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and Bishop William Angie Smith, at which the Bishop told Roberts, \\"We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we've got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church.\\" Roberts became an elder in the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist Church. From 1968 through 1987, Roberts was a member of the United Methodist Church's ministry. AP, PREACHER'S ORDINATION IN DISPUTE, nytimes.com, USA, October 28, 1987 Roberts affected the American Protestant community. According to one authority in conservative Protestant culture, his ministry's influence was second only to that of Billy Graham. His divine healing ministry called for prayer to heal the whole person‚Äîbody, mind and spirit. Many labeled him a faith healer, but he rejected this with the comment: \\"God heals‚ÄîI don't.\\" He played a major role in bringing American Pentecostal Christianity into the mainstream. Even though Roberts was often associated with the prosperity gospel and the faith movement because of his close doctrinal and personal ties with Word-Faith teachers, his abundant life teachings did not fully identify him with that movement. In 1977, Roberts claimed to have had a vision from a 900-foot-tall Jesus who told him to build City of Faith Medical and Research Center, and the hospital would be a success. In 1980, Roberts said he had a vision that encouraged him to continue the construction of his City of Faith Medical and Research Center in Oklahoma, which opened in 1981. At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for only eight years before closing in late 1989, but the importance of treating the whole person‚Äîspirit, mind, and body‚Äîwas conveyed to many medical professionals. The Orthopedic Hospital of Oklahoma still operates on its premises. In 1983 Roberts said Jesus had appeared to him in person and commissioned him to find a cure for cancer. Roberts' fundraising was controversial. In January 1987, during a fundraising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would \\"call him home.\\" However, the year before on Easter he had told a gathering at the Dallas Convention Center that God had instructed him to raise the money \\"by the end of the year\\" or he would die. Regardless of this new March deadline and the fact that he was still $4.5 million short of his goal, some were fearful that he was referring to suicide, given the impassioned pleas and tears that accompanied his statement. Late in March 1987 while Roberts was fasting and praying in the Prayer Tower, Florida dog track owner Jerry Collins donated $1.3 million.Dog-Track Owner Gives $1.3 Million to Oral Roberts, Associated Press (Los Angeles Times), March 23, 1987.FLORIDA TRACK OWNER 'SAVES' ORAL ROBERTS, The Orlando Sentinel (now SunSentinel published in Florida), Dan Tracy, March 22, 1987. Highly worried from what he perceived as Roberts threatening to starve himself, Collins said, \\"I did it in order to save the guy from going to heaven in a hurry. It's got nothing to do with religion. I've been a Baptist and a Methodist. I believe in religion and not just the church. You have to help one another.\\"Jerry Collins, 89; Built an Empire of Race Tracks (Obituary), New York Times, David J. Morrow, Aug. 6, 1997. \\" . . A founder of New College in Sarasota, Mr. Collins gave the institution a $1.2 million motel he owned in Bradenton, Fla., and raised another $7 million for a library. He also gave $600,000 for a new veterinary school at the University of Florida. . \\" Altogether, Roberts raised a total of $9.1 million. Later that year, he announced that God had raised the dead through his ministry. Some of Roberts' fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who headed a business writing donation letters for other evangelicals such as Don Stewart and Robert Tilton. Roberts maintained his love of finery and one obituary claimed that even when times became economically hard, \\"he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets‚Äîairbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures\\". The CityPlex office complex, originally built as Oral Roberts' City of Faith Medical and Research Center in Tulsa. He stirred up controversy when Time reported in 1987 that his son Richard Roberts claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead. That year, the Bloom County comic strip recast its character Bill the Cat as a satirized televangelist, \\"Fundamentally Oral Bill.\\" In 1987, Time stated that he was \\"re-emphasizing faith healing and [is] reaching for his old-time constituency.\\" However, the income of his organization continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the Tulsa Tribune) and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money. Harry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents \\"rubber-stamped\\" the \\"use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house.\\" In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts' home. The lavish expenses led to McNevin's resignation from the Board. In 1988, Oral Roberts and his son Richard were sued for $15 million in federal court by patients at City of Faith Medical Center, claiming the two were frauds who did not visit or heal patients in the hospital. His organizations were also affected by scandals involving other televangelists and the City of Faith hospital was forced to close in 1989 after losing money. Roberts was forced to respond with the sale of his holiday homes in Palm Springs and Beverly Hills as well as three of his Mercedes cars. Oral Roberts' son Richard Roberts resigned from the presidency of ORU on November 23, 2007 after being named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging improper use of university funds for political and personal purposes, and improper use of university resources. The university was given a donation of $8 million by entrepreneur Mart Green, and although the lawsuit was still in process, the school submitted to an outside audit, and with a good report an additional $62 million was given by Green. Oral Roberts continued in his role as ORU chancellor, helping in the leadership of ORU along with Billy Joe Daugherty, who was named as the executive regent to assume administrative responsibilities of the Office of the President by the ORU Board of Regents. Oral Roberts continued as the ORU chancellor until his death, but in 2009, eleven months before his death, handed over the leadership of ORU to its incoming president, Mark Rutland. The Oklahoma Senate adopted a resolution honoring the life of Oral Roberts, and he accepted this honor in 2009 at the age of 91, seven months before his death. The Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters (OAB) elected Roberts to the OAB Hall of Fame one month before his death. Personal life Roberts was married to Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock (1917-2005) for 66 years from December 25, 1938, until her death from a fall, on May 4, 2005, at the age of 88. Their daughter Rebecca Nash died in an airplane crash on February 11, 1977 with her husband, businessman Marshall Nash. Their elder son, Ronald Roberts, committed suicide by shooting himself in the heart on June 10, 1982, five months after receiving a court order to undergo counseling at a drug treatment center and six months after coming out as gay. The other two Roberts children are son Richard, an evangelist and former president of Oral Roberts University, and daughter Roberta Potts, an attorney. Roberts died of complications from pneumonia on December 15, 2009, at the age of 91. He had been \\"semi-retired\\" and living in Newport Beach, California. He was interred next to his wife at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma (the same cemetery where T. L. Osborn was interred, nearly 4 years after). According to a 1987 article in The New York Review of Books by Martin Gardner, the \\"most accurate and best documented biography\\" is Oral Roberts: An American Life, an objective study by David Edwin Harrell Jr., a historian at Auburn University.

From right to left: Stockholm Palace, Storkyrkan, Bollhuset Theatre and the Tessin Palace. Drawing, Martin Rudolf Heland. The Royal Swedish Opera, 1934 Royal Swedish Opera () is Sweden's national stage for opera and ballet. Location and environment The building is located in the center of Sweden's capital Stockholm in the borough of Norrmalm, on the eastern side of Gustav Adolfs torg across from the former Arvfurstens Palats, now Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It lies on the north side of the Norrstr√∂m river and is connected to the Royal Palace through the Norrbro bridge. Further historically as well as architecturally important buildings in the close neighborhood are the Sager House, official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden, and the Riksdag building. History The opera company was founded by King Gustav III and its first performance, Thetis and Phel√©e with Carl Stenborg and Elisabeth Olin, was given on January 18, 1773; this was the first native speaking opera performed in Sweden. But the first opera house was not opened until 1782 and served for a century before being replaced at the end of the 19th century. Both houses are officially called the \\"Royal Opera\\", however the terms \\"The Gustavian Opera\\" and \\"The Oscarian Opera\\", or the \\"Old\\" and \\"New\\" Opera are used when distinction is needed. = The Gustavian Opera = The original Stockholm Opera House, the work of architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz was commissioned by King Gustav III, a strong adherent of the ideal of an enlightened absolutism and as such was a great patron of the arts. The Swedish Opera company had first been located in Bollhuset, but there was a need to separate the Opera from the theatre and give them separate buildings. Construction began in 1775 and the theatre was inaugurated on 30 September 1782 with a performance of the German composer Johann Gottlieb Naumann's Cora och Alonzo. It was also the place for public masquerade balls, events inspired from the famous opera-balls in Paris, which was open for everyone wearing a mask at a cheap cost and somewhat ill-reputed. The Gustavian opera building in 1880 The building was very imposing with its centre Corinthian tetrastyle portico supporting four statues and topped by the royal crown. The four-tiered auditorium was oval in shape, had excellent acoustics and sight lines. The sumptuous foyer contained neoclassic medallions and pilasters. It was in the foyer of the opera house where the king met his fate: during a masquerade on March 16, 1792, he was shot by Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m, and died 7 days later. (In turn, this event inspired the operas Gustave III by Daniel Auber and Un ballo in maschera by Verdi.) Following the assassination, the opera house was closed until 1 November 1792, when it was opened again, which by some was considered shocking. The son of Gustav III, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, did not like the Opera, possibly because of the murder of his father, and disliked the fact that the scene of his father's murder was used as a place of amusement and leisure, and when a frivolous play was performed for his queen Frederica of Baden in 1806, he decided to close it down. It remained closed until 1809, and when the king was deposed, it took until May 1812, before it was organised enough to be fully opened again. = The Oscarian Opera, Operan = Operans Guldfoaj√©n: The Golden Hall (with a bust of Swedish singer Birgit Nilsson) at the Royal Swedish Opera. The old opera was demolished in 1892 to give way to the construction of a new Opera drawn by Axel Johan Anderberg, which was finished seven years later and inaugurated by King Oscar II with a production of a Swedish opera (that tradition having been quite firmly established during the 19th century), Franz Berwald's Estrella de Soria. The new house had the letters Kungl. Teatern, literally \\"Royal Theatre\\" (which caused the later-founded Royal Dramatic Theatre to add the distinction \\"dramatic\\" to its name). The building is now simply called Operan (\\"The Opera\\"), written in golden letters above the middle arch on the front facade. It is a majestic neo-classical building with a magnificent gold foyer (Guldfoaj√©n) and elegant marble grand staircase leading to a three-tiered auditorium somewhat smaller than the old theatre. It presently seats 1,200. Most productions are now sung in the original language (with Swedish subtitles), with only a few in Swedish. The Royal Swedish Family of King Carl XVI Gustaf keeps the Royal Box reserved, located in the first tier in the auditorium above the orchestra pit.  Ensembles, artists and artistic leadership  Famous singers who have been part of the opera's ensemble have included Jussi Bj√∂rling, G√∂sta Winbergh, Nicolai Gedda, Peter Mattei, Jenny Lind, Birgit Nilsson, Elisabeth S√∂derstr√∂m, Fritz Arlberg, Anne Sofie von Otter, Katarina Dalayman and Nina Stemme. The orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, the Royal Swedish Orchestra, Kungliga Hovkapellet, dates back to 1526. Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians including wind players and a timpanist but no string players. Consequently, the Royal Swedish Orchestra is one of the oldest orchestras in Europe. Armas J√§rnefelt was on the music staff from 1905, rising to become chief conductor between 1923‚Äì1933 and 1938‚Äì1946.Photo of J√§rnefelt conducting the Royal Swedish Orchestra during the Opera House's 400th anniversary celebrations (in Swedish). Retrieved 25 August 2015. The Royal Swedish Ballet, Kungliga Baletten, was founded by Gustav III of Sweden in 1773. The current general manager of the Royal Swedish Opera is the Swedish mezzo-soprano Birgitta Svend√©n. Its most recent chief conductor was Lawrence Renes, who held the post from 2012 through 2017. In January 2020, Royal Swedish Opera announced the appointment of Alan Gilbert as its next music director, effective in the spring of 2021. Gilbert had first guest-conducted with the company in 2012.

His father desired that he study business so that he might take over the family spice trade, but Johann Bernoulli did not like business and convinced his father to allow him to study medicine instead. However, Johann Bernoulli did not enjoy medicine either and began studying mathematics on the side with his older brother Jacob. Throughout Johann Bernoulli's education at Basel University the Bernoulli brothers worked together spending much of their time studying the newly discovered infinitesimal calculus. They were among the first mathematicians to not only study and understand calculus but to apply it to various problems.The Bernoulli Family, by H. Bernhard, Doubleday, Page & Company, (1938) =Adult life= After graduating from Basel University, Johann Bernoulli moved to teach differential equations. Later, in 1694, he married Dorothea Falkner, the daughter of an alderman of Basel, and soon after accepted a position as the professor of mathematics at the University of Groningen. At the request of his father-in-law, Bernoulli began the voyage back to his home town of Basel in 1705. Just after setting out on the journey he learned of his brother's death to tuberculosis. Bernoulli had planned on becoming the professor of Greek at Basel University upon returning but instead was able to take over as professor of mathematics, his older brother's former position. As a student of Leibniz's calculus, Bernoulli sided with him in 1713 in the Leibniz‚ÄìNewton debate over who deserved credit for the discovery of calculus. Bernoulli defended Leibniz by showing that he had solved certain problems with his methods that Newton had failed to solve. Bernoulli also promoted Descartes' vortex theory over Newton's theory of gravitation. This ultimately delayed acceptance of Newton's theory in continental Europe. Commercium philosophicum et mathematicum (1745), a collection of letters between Leibnitz and Bernoulli. In 1724, Johann Bernoulli entered a competition sponsored by the French Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences, which posed the question: :What are the laws according to which a perfectly hard body, put into motion, moves another body of the same nature either at rest or in motion, and which it encounters either in a vacuum or in a plenum? In defending a view previously espoused by Leibniz, he found himself postulating an infinite external force required to make the body elastic by overcoming the infinite internal force making the body hard. In consequence, he was disqualified for the prize, which was won by Maclaurin. However, Bernoulli's paper was subsequently accepted in 1726 when the Acad√©mie considered papers regarding elastic bodies, for which the prize was awarded to Pierre Mazi√®re. Bernoulli received an honourable mention in both competitions. =Disputes and controversy= Although Johann and his brother Jacob Bernoulli worked together before Johann graduated from Basel University, shortly after this, the two developed a jealous and competitive relationship. Johann was jealous of Jacob's position and the two often attempted to outdo each other. After Jacob's death Johann's jealousy shifted toward his own talented son, Daniel. In 1738 the father‚Äìson duo nearly simultaneously published separate works on hydrodynamics. Johann attempted to take precedence over his son by purposely and falsely predating his work two years prior to his son's. The Bernoulli brothers often worked on the same problems, but not without friction. Their most bitter dispute concerned the brachistochrone curve problem, or the equation for the path followed by a particle from one point to another in the shortest amount of time, if the particle is acted upon by gravity alone. Johann presented the problem in 1696, offering a reward for its solution. Entering the challenge, Johann proposed the cycloid, the path of a point on a moving wheel, also pointing out the relation this curve bears to the path taken by a ray of light passing through layers of varied density. Jacob proposed the same solution, but Johann's derivation of the solution was incorrect, and he presented his brother Jacob's derivation as his own. Bernoulli was hired by Guillaume de l'H√¥pital for tutoring in mathematics. Bernoulli and l'H√¥pital signed a contract which gave l'H√¥pital the right to use Bernoulli's discoveries as he pleased. L'H√¥pital authored the first textbook on infinitesimal calculus, Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes in 1696, which mainly consisted of the work of Bernoulli, including what is now known as l'H√¥pital's rule. Subsequently, in letters to Leibniz, Varignon and others, Bernoulli complained that he had not received enough credit for his contributions, in spite of the preface of his book: Illustration from De motu corporum gravium published in Acta Eruditorum, 1713 Works   See also *Sophomore's dream ‚Äì a pair of analytical identities by Bernoulli Notes References External links  Golba, Paul, \\"Bernoulli, Johan'\\" * \\"Johann Bernoulli\\" * * discusses the strange agreement between Bernoulli and de l'H√¥pital on pages 59‚Äì62.

He wrote an early treatise on witchcraft, De Lamiis et Pythonicis Mulieribus (Of Witches and Diviner Women), published in 1489 when he was Doctor of Laws of Padua and professor at the University of Constance. The work is written in the form of a dialogue. Molitor was one of the sceptical or \\"moderate\\" proponents of witchcraft of his time. Although Molitor supported the death sentence for heretics and practitioners of witchcraft, from a moderate point of view for his time he considered that the Sabbaths were an illusion caused by the Devil and not a reality. He wrote the work to allay the doubts held by Archduke Sigismund of Austria regarding the topic. Sigismund had learned of witchcraft from the Dominican inquisitors, James Sprenger and Heinrich Kramer, who had journeyed to the Tyrol to \\"root out witchcraft\\", but he was unconvinced of their claims; Sigismund in the dialogue was quick to dismiss evidence that was produced through the use of torture: \\"For the fear of punishments incites men to say what is contrary to the nature of the facts\\". Molitor often quotes the Bible, Church Fathers and poets. Omnipresent is Molitor's conviction in the power of the devil who acts through the permission of God, to deceive mortals who are thereby culpable. He explained Merlin as a real human being and not, as many authorities commonly believed, the offspring of a devil and a woman. Editions * Molitoris, Ulrich,Schriften, ed.

It is located in and is the namesake of the Sham Shui Po District. Although it is predominantly poor, Sham Shui Po is one of the densest and most vibrant neighbourhoods in Hong Kong. It has a diverse mix of migrants from rural China, working-class families and seniors, with many living in cage homes, subdivided flats and public housing estates. Sham Shui Po has many lively street markets, electronics outlets, fabric stores, restaurants and food vendors. It is famous for Golden Computer Shopping Arcade for bargain electronics and accessories. History The discovery in 1955 of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb indicates that as early as 2000 years ago there were Chinese people settled in what is now Sham Shui Po. Sham Shui Po means \\"Deep Water Pier\\" in Cantonese. At the time, the water in Sham Shui Po was deeper than the beach of Cheung Sha Wan to the northwest. It is close to the former peninsula of Tai Kok Tsui, the low ridge of which ends in Sham Shui Po. In the first stage, the town of Sham Shui Po was bounded by Yen Chow Street, Tung Chau Street, Wong Chuk Street and Apliu Street. Part of the town was on reclamation. The town was surrounded by villages of Un Chau, Tin Liu and Tong Mei. A nullah along Nam Cheong Street was constructed to drain the water of rivers north and east (which explains the street's wideness). The town was closed to Cosmopolitan Dock on the outer shore of Tai Kok Tsui. Under Japanese occupation, a concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War. An account of life by a British POW has been published as The Hard Way: Surviving Shamshuipo POW Camp 1941‚Äì45 by Victor Stanley Ebbage (Spellmount, 2011). Land use As Sham Shui Po was one of the earliest developed areas in Hong Kong, it was once a commercial, industrial and transportation hub of the territory. As of 2003, Sham Shui Po is covered mainly by residential buildings, with public housing estates built on approximately of land. Factories and warehouses are still concentrated mainly in Cheung Sha Wan. It is connected to the MTR rail network via the Sham Shui Po Station on the Tsuen Wan Line. Cityscape Urban renewal Sham Shui Po is an area where urban decay is serious in Hong Kong. The government is carrying out urban renewal projects. In July 2003 the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) announced that its first urban renewal project would be to improve the living environment at Po On Road/Wai Wai Road in Sham Shui Po. Covering an area of and affecting approximately 500 households, this project will provide 330 residential flats and some retail units. Government, institutional and community facilities will also be erected for the community. This development will require the HKHS to acquire about 157 properties, costing an estimated HK$240 million. The total development cost of the project is about HK$720 million. To promote creative tourism in old Hong Kong districts of Wan Chai and Sham Shui Po Hong Kong Design Centre unveiled a budget of $60 Million. Shopping The Digital Hub Logo at Sham Shui Po Colourful parasols cropped up along the busy Apliu Street A market in Ki Lung Street The street market in Sham Shui Po is a hotspot for both locals and tourists. The Apliu Street market is well known in Hong Kong for its electronics. The vendors in this open-air street market sell a wide variety of products at reasonable prices, allowing individuals to trade second-hand goods here. Different shops sell a variety of goods including industrial electronics, analogue and digital radio communications equipment, disco effects equipment, crockery, 1940s-era radios, LPs, torches, and audiophile hi-fi amplifiers in various stages of repair. The Hong Kong government promotes Apliu Street as Hong Kong's answer to Akihabara (in Japan). Golden Computer Centre is one of the major malls selling computer-related equipment (see next section). The annual Hong Kong computer fair held in the streets of Sham Shui Po attracts a large crowd. The market on Ki Lung Street is also famous for its fresh food and cheap prices. In the early 1990s, the Hong Kong government rebuilt the market and also added air conditioning. There are numerous fashionwear wholesalers along Cheung Sha Wan Road. On weekends, some shops allow retail purchases, offering quality clothes at very affordable prices. Nam Cheong Street and Ki Lung Street are most famous for their fabric stores, containing cloth, sash, ribbons and buttons. =Golden Shopping Centre= Golden Shopping Centre at the corner of Fuk Wa Street and Yen Chow Street. Once infamous for counterfeit software but today considered one of the cheapest places in Hong Kong to purchase a personal computer, the Golden Shopping Centre is a prominent IT shopping centre. Products range from complete systems, cell phones, to various peripherals. Unlike purely consumer- oriented IT shopping centres, Golden features several stores specializing in professional and esoteric network equipment. The Golden Shopping Centre is also known for the number of video game stores it contains, where people purchase gaming systems, software and accessories at either a slightly discounted price, or in special in-store packages which might include an extra game or extra accessories. Since the halls are extremely narrow, it is often very congested, especially on weekends. The mall has two floors. The upper floor, Golden Computer Centre (), mainly sells games and gaming software, while the lower floor, Golden Computer Arcade (), focuses on the sales of computer-oriented hardware. They were originally fashion markets named \\"Golden Shopping Centre\\" and \\"Golden Shopping Arcade\\" respectively. =Dragon Centre= Dragon Centre is a nine-storey shopping centre. It was the largest shopping centre in West Kowloon until Elements opened its doors above the Kowloon MTR Station.  Local Delicacies  As Sham Shui Po is usually regarded as one of the poorest and oldest districts in Hong Kong, it is well known for people to find cheap and local food in Sham Shui Po. A lot of local restaurants are located in Fuk Wa Street, Fuk Wing Street, Pei Ho Street and Kweilin Street. Some of the famous restaurants include Kung Wo Beancurd Factory, Wai Kee Noodle Cafe, Man Kee Cart Noodle and Kwan Kee Store, which are highly praised for their soy milk and pudding, pork liver noodles, cart noodles and traditional puddings respectively. Some of these unique restaurants are also starred by Michelin and recommended in its list. Streets Erhu performance is a popular pastime for the district dwellers.

One of the first New towns in Hong Kong, Kwun Tong was, and remains, a major industrial area. Its population has been growing rapidly, and the demand for housing, medical and educational facilities and services has been increasing. In view of this, a number of community development projects, such as the redevelopment of old housing estates and the construction of major parks, have been implemented in recent years. These projects have incorporated a wide range of supporting facilities, like primary and secondary schools, clinics, community centres and open spaces. All these facilities have brought about a new face to the Kwun Tong District, making it a more comfortable place for the people to live. History A minibus Stop at Yue Man Square. This handwritten bus stop sign and bus display are still written as \\"\\" The Chinese name of Kwun Tong (\\"\\") was formerly written as \\"\\" (transcribed as Koon Tong in Cantonese Yale). Despite the identical pronunciation of these two names in Cantonese, the local dialect, they have different meanings. \\"\\" literally means Mandarin Pond, which was allegedly named after the Koon Fu salt yards () set up by the government to secure central administration of the salt trade and prevent unauthorised salt preparation and trading starting from Song Dynasty. In those days, there were many salt yards around Kwun Tong, whose long coastline stretched to as far as Kowloon Bay and To Kwa Wan in the west. Troops were stationed here to monitor the salt yards' operation. Despite the government's close watch, illegal salt trade was still active on Lantau Island. When it was discovered by the officials, a full-scale crackdown was initiated. The Lantau villagers instigated an all-out uprising of salt farmers, leading finally to a major civil riot. According to other stories, Kwun Tong was a typhoon shelter for the Kowloon Water Police, which made it an important political and defence point of north-west Kowloon. Black Hill (Ng Kwai Shan), which today rises up behind Lam Tin Estate, was known as Koon Fu Hill () at that time. In the 1950s, when Kwun Tong was being developed as a new town, the local residents disliked the word Koon (), which literally means official or government, and they persuaded the Hong Kong government to change the place name to Kwun Tong (), which literally means viewing a pond. The development of Kwun Tong spearheaded the construction and planning of new towns in the New Territories, although the first project was limited in scope and did not share the features of self-contained communities like the later ones.

Another facility, opened in 1983, Li Fook Lam Indoor Sports Centre, was operated by the Tai Po Sports Association Limited, a non-profit making limited company. =Football= Tai Po FC is the first district football team ever to make it to the Hong Kong First Division League among the 19 district football sides from the Hong Kong Third District Division League. The club plays its home games at Tai Po Sports Ground and has since won the 2008-09 Hong Kong FA Cup. The district had several football fields (five-a-side, seven-a-side football) for amateur football. In 2016, another football fields and sport complex (which includes an indoor swimming pool) would be built. Economy Hong Kong Note Printing Limited, which prints all the bank notes in Hong Kong, is located in the Tai Po Industrial Estate, an industrial area of light industries (food processing, printing, etc.) Hong Kong and China Gas also has its major gas plant in the industrial estate, which supplies most (98%) of the town gas of the city from that plant. =Spa Resort Development= There is a plan to develop a spa hotel resort at Ting Kok, near Tai Mei Tuk. The site will occupy 61,000 sq m and has no more than 230 hotel rooms. Tai Po District councilor Yam Kai-Kong admits the benefits from tourism and job opportunities will be good but he is also concerned about the mangroves and increased traffic in the area.Â§ßÂüîÊ±ÄËßíÊâìÈÄ†Ê∞¥ÁôÇ‰∏≠ÂøÉ Oriental Daily. 4 January 2011.

Mastema ( MastƒìmƒÅh; Mesetƒìma) is an angel who persecutes evil in the Book of Jubilees. He carries out punishments for God, as well as tempting humans and testing their faith. In the Zadokite Fragments and the Dead Sea Scrolls, he is the angel of disaster, the father of all evil, and a flatterer of God. He is said to have become a fallen angel. He first appears in the literature of the Second Temple Period as a personification of the Hebrew word mastemah (◊û÷∑◊©÷∞◊Ç◊ò÷µ◊û÷∏◊î), meaning \\"hatred\\", \\"hostility\\", \\"enmity\\", or \\"persecution\\". Book of Jubilees According to the Book of Jubilees, Mastema (\\"hostility\\") is the chief of the demons engendered by the Watchers/fallen angels with women. His actions and name indicate he is the Satan, the \\"Adversary\\", but in these religious works Satan is more like him who appears in the Book of Job with a function to fulfill under God than like Satan of later tradition who is the uttermost enemy of God. Beliar, mentioned twice in Jubilees, is likely to be identical with Mastema in this work. When God is ready to destroy all these demons after the flood and Noah prays that his descendants be released from their attacks, Mastema intervenes, beseeching God to allow him to retain and control one tenth of these demons in order to exercise his authority because they are \\"intended to corrupt and lead astray before my judgement because the evil of the sons of men is great\\". (Jubilees 10:8) Mastema is the tester of humans, with God's permission. Mastema sends a plague of birds onto the land in the days of Terah. (Jubilees 11:10) Later, Mastema counsels God to test Abraham (Jubilees 17:15-16), just as Satan in the book of Job wants permission to test Job. As Abraham prepares to sacrifice his son Isaac, Mastema stands in God's presence. On his deathbed, Isaac promises that the spirits of Mastema will have no power to turn Jacob or his descendants away from Yahweh. The strange account in where Yahweh meets Moses by the way and tries to kill him is retold in a way that attributes the attack to Mastema instead (Jubilees 48:1-3). It is claimed that Mastema aided the Egyptian priests that opposed Moses. Mastema is also said to have been chained while the Israelites left Egypt, but then let go to encourage the Egyptians to chase after the Israelites and so come to their doom in the Red Sea. The deaths of the firstborn of the Egyptians are attributed to \\"all the powers of Mastema\\". In fiction *In Anne Rice's novel Vittorio the Vampire, Mastema is an angel that aids the main character in attacking a vampire coven. *In the Megami Tensei series of video games and its spin-offs, Mastema is portrayed as a demon, although, within the context of the franchise, the term \\"demon\\" is used in its classical meaning (cf. daemon) to refer to any supernatural creature. Mastema can be fought but can also join the player's group. In Strange Journey, Mastema plays a relatively big role in the story. *In the Digimon game, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth, Mastemon is an Angel Digimon who manipulates light and darkness, and has the power to cross through space-time. *In the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game, the card \\"Darklord Nasten\\" (Â†ïÂ§©‰Ωø„Éû„Çπ„ÉÜ„Ç£„Éû, datenshi [= Fallen Angel] Mastema) is based on this demon. *In the comic book Birthright, Mastema is the name of one of the mages living on Earth that maintain the barrier between worlds. She is revealed shortly after her introduction to be the daughter of the series' main villain. *In Dorohedoro the city of Mastema is the place in which everyone present was transformed into mushrooms years before.

As one of the 9 districts located in the New Territories, it covers the areas of Sha Tin, Tai Wai, Ma On Shan, Fo Tan, Siu Lek Yuen and Ma Liu Shui. The district is the most populous district in Hong Kong, with a population of 659,794 as per 2016 by-census, having a larger population than many countries or dependencies including Iceland, Malta, Montenegro and Brunei. The Sha Tin District covers approximately 69.4 km2 (26.8 sq. mi), including Sha Tin New Town and several country parks. Built mostly on reclaimed land in Sha Tin Hoi, the well- developed Sha Tin New Town comprises mainly residential areas along the banks of the Shing Mun River Channel. In the early 1970s it was a rural township of about 30,000 people. After Sha Tin's first public housing estate, Lek Yuen Estate, was completed in 1976, the settlement began to expand. Today, about 65% of the district's population live in public rental housing, housing under Hong Kong's Tenants Purchase Scheme, or Home Ownership Scheme.  History  = Pre-colonial Era = Sha Tin was formerly named Lek Yuen, literally meaning the \\"source of trickling\\" or \\"source of clear water\\". The area of the present day Sha Tin was populated before the Ming Dynasty. As the Shing Mun River runs across the district, most local residents were farmers and relied on agriculture for living. In 1579, Tai Wai Village, the oldest and largest walled village in the district was built. Several other villages were built along the river after Tai Wai Village. = Colonial Era = Sha Tin started to be administered by the British Hong Kong government after the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory was signed. The establishment of the Sha Tin Station of the Kowloon-Canton Railway (British Section) in 1910 caused Sha Tin to be the more common name for the area, replacing Lek Yuen ever since. Sha Tin was a former market town at the present location of Sha Tin Centre Street and New Town Plaza shopping centre. Sha Tin Town was the second batch of satellite towns, or new town, to be built in the New Territories, on land reclaimed from the sea. Land use Sha Tin and Shing Mun River Wu Kai Sha In addition to the residential areas, there are four industrial areas for light industries: Tai Wai, Fo Tan, Siu Lek Yuen and Shek Mun. The Chinese University of Hong Kong is also located in Sha Tin. People typically travel there via the MTR East Rail Line and get off at University station. A minibus service operates on campus. Sha Tin is the location for Hong Kong's second equestrian racecourse (the first and most famous being Happy Valley Racecourse) which has a capacity of 85,000. This course hosted the equestrian events during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were hosted by Beijing, but there was concern over proper quarantine and disease monitoring in the Chinese capital. Penfold Park is located inside the racecourse and closed on race days. It is best accessed via the Fo Tan Station. Sha Tin Park is another major park located in Sha Tin. Shing Mun River Residential, commercial and industrial buildings with numerous village type developments has been built along the two sides of the Shing Mun River since the early stage of development of Shatin. Walled Buildings in Tai Wai The Shing Mun River is a 7 km long, 200m wide channel originating at the Shing Mun Reservoir (Tai Mo Shan catchment) that runs as a river from the Tai Wai area, through the Sha Tin town centre to Tide Cove. It has three main tributaries, namely Tai Wai Nullah, Fo Tan Nullah and Siu Lek Yuen Nullah. Along the Shing Mun River are high-rise residential, commercial and industrial buildings with numerous village type developments scattered around. Transportation =Railways= Sha Tin District is served by a total of fourteen rapid transit stations on two lines of the MTR railway network, the most of any district in Hong Kong. Five of these stations lie on the East Rail line, namely Tai Wai, Sha Tin, Fo Tan, Racecourse and University. Although all except Racecourse station (which only has service on race days) lie on the original Kowloon-Canton Railway, the oldest in the territory, only Sha Tin station existed at the time the line was inaugurated in 1910, providing direct service to Hung Hom station in Kowloon in the south and the mainland border crossings at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau in the north. The other four stations were added later, mostly during the electrification of the line in the 1980s, as a result of the development of the Chinese University, Sha Tin Racecourse, and Sha Tin New Town. The Ma On Shan line, a branch of the East Rail line, began service in December 2004, serving the eastern parts of Sha Tin and the Ma On Shan area. Its nine stations, running between Tai Wai and Wu Kai Sha, were all located within Sha Tin District, and served newly built housing estates along the route. The only interchange between this line and the rest of the network was at Tai Wai, leading to extreme congestion on the East Rail line between this station and Kowloon Tong, which has a connection to the Kwun Tong line. Both this line and the East Rail line were operated by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation until they were absorbed by the MTR Corporation in 2007. Railway connectivity to and from Sha Tin District is expected to be significantly improved following the completion of the Sha Tin to Central Link, which will see extensions to both the East Rail and Ma On Shan lines. The first section, known as Tuen Ma Line Phase 1, opened in January 2020, extending the Ma On Shan line to Kai Tak via Diamond Hill, and includes a further station serving Hin Keng at the southern end of Sha Tin District. This is expected to relieve congestion on the East Rail line between Tai Wai and Kowloon Tong. By the end of 2021, the full Tuen Ma line would open with a new route through Kowloon City, merging with the West Rail line at Hung Hom and continuing to the northwestern New Territories via western Kowloon. Finally, in 2022, the East Rail line would be extended across Victoria Harbour and terminate at Admiralty station, providing a direct service to Hong Kong Island for the first time. =Buses= A total of 110 franchised bus routes serve various points in Sha Tin District. These are predominantly operated by Kowloon Motor Bus, which has a depot in Siu Lek Yuen. They include a combination of routes entirely within the district, routes connecting the district to other parts of the New Territories and Kowloon, and several cross- harbour routes to Hong Kong Island, including one as far as Aberdeen. Furthermore, Long Win Bus operates several routes to Lantau Island, the airport, and the Hong Kong‚ÄìZhuhai‚ÄìMacau Bridge, while New World First Bus has express bus service to eastern Hong Kong Island and Tseung Kwan O. The district is also served by various public light bus routes. =Roads= Sha Tin District is served by an extensive road network. Four trunk routes on Hong Kong's strategic route network pass through the district: *Route 1 between Fo Tan and Aberdeen via Kowloon Tong, Hung Hom, and Wan Chai. *Route 2 between Ma Liu Shui and Quarry Bay via Diamond Hill and Kwun Tong. *Route 8 between Tai Wai and Hong Kong International Airport via Lai Chi Kok, Tsing Yi, and Lantau Island. *Route 9 to Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Fanling, and Tai Po. These trunk roads make use of several road tunnels leading to the district. Of these, the Lion Rock Tunnel used by Route 1, is the oldest, having opened in 1967 to replace the overcrowded Tai Po Road to Sham Shui Po. Despite the opening of further tunnels over the years, it remains the most direct route to central Kowloon, and thus the most heavily travelled. The Lion Rock Tunnel was followed by the Shing Mun Tunnels on Route 9 in 1990, the Tate's Cairn Tunnel on Route 2 in 1991, and most recently the Tsing Sha Highway on Route 8 (consisting of the Eagle's Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel) in 2008. Other major roads in the area include Sha Lek Highway linking central Sha Tin to Ma On Shan, Sha Tin Road linking eastern Sha Tin to Fo Tan, Tate's Cairn Highway linking eastern Sha Tin to Ma Liu Shui, Tolo Highway linking Sha Tin to the northern districts, and Sai Sha Road linking Ma On Shan to Sai Kung. A network of cycle tracks throughout Sha Tin measures about 50 km long and is the longest cycle track network in Hong Kong.

The district comprises the southern half of Sai Kung Peninsula, Clear Water Bay Peninsula in the New Territories and a strip of land to the east of Kowloon. Areas in the district include Sai Kung Town, Hong Kong Global Geopark, Tseung Kwan O and over 70 islands of different sizes. The administrative centre had been located in Sai Kung Town until the Sai Kung District Office was relocated to Tseung Kwan O recently. The district's population is concentrated in Tseung Kwan O, as of 2011. In 2011, the district was the third youngest district, with a median age of 39.3. Known as the \\"back garden of Hong Kong\\", Sai Kung has been able to retain its natural scenery. Many traditional customs and cultures are still retained in the rural villages. History The modern geopolitical entity of Sai Kung District was formed after World War II. Settlements existed in the area prior to the signing of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, which ceded the area to the colony of Hong Kong from the Qing Empire in 1898. Those ceded areas are now collectively known as the New Territories and New Kowloon. According to Professor , unlike other villages of the New Territories, villages in Sai Kung did not form any yeuk (), a kind of inter- village alliances in the 19th century in the Qing dynasty. Under the colonial rule, villages in Sai Kung were grouped under Tung Yeuk (also known as Tung Hoi Yeuk; ) in 1898. Soon after, the district office of New Territories was established. The New Territories was divided into Northern and Southern District (both not the same as the modern day districts of HK) and New Kowloon in the 1920s. The area around the modern day Sai Kung Town was under the District Office North until 1947, which the area was under the administration of the Southern District (not the same as modern day Southern District) from 1947. The Southern District was under further reform since 1957. After the end of World War II (the author did not state the exact year, however), the New Territories was divided into 8 sub-divisions, one of which was named after Sai Kung. Such sub-divisions was soon abolished. The North and South District Office were merged to form New Territories Administration, a department of the executive branch of the government, in 1948‚Äì1952, which has 3 sub-divisions: Tai Po (covers some of the area of the former Northern District), Yuen Long and Southern District. Sai Kung was under the aforementioned Southern District. Tsuen Wan District Officer was established in 1959 and craved out from the Southern District. The Southern District at that time only administrated the modern-day Sai Kung District and Islands District. A branch office of the Southern District was also established in Mui Wo in 1957, which now belongs to Lantau Island of the Islands District. It was reported that circa the early 1960s, the Southern District was further split into Sai Kung District and Islands District, but merged back in 1963. By 1969, the New Territories Administration had 7 district offices, of which one was named after Sai Kung. In 1977, the Hong Kong Governor announced to establish District Advisory Boards to invite locals to become advisors. Although Sai Kung locals, as well as other rural villages of the New Territories, already established their chambers and voting representatives to Heung Yee Kuk, an advisory body to the colonial government, as early as the 1930s. The Sai Kung District and its District Council (at that time known as District Board) were formally formed in 1982. (Established in 1981, first election in 1982) A year before, the New Territories Administration was merged with its Kowloon and Hong Kong Island counterpart, the Home Affairs Department to form the City and New Territories Administration (it was renamed the Home Affairs Department again in 1993), although the Administration had transferred some functions to the Lands Department in 1982. Since 1985, the district officers of the Hong Kong Districts no longer chaired their respective districts councils. In a larger scale of history, due to the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which would hand over the whole colony to the People's Republic of China, the colonial government had made several political reforms on local politics. A water route from the northern Sai Kung Peninsula to Tai Po existed at least since the Qing dynasty. For this historical and other reasons, the northern portion of the Sai Kung Peninsula belongs to the Tai Po District, but not part of Sai Kung District. Sai Kung was a local industrial centre before the 1900s. For example, in Sheung Yu (), villagers produced mortar and fertiliser from their own lime kiln. Villages also scattered on the islands of Port Shelter, Rocky Harbour, on Sai Kung Peninsula, on Clear Water Bay Peninsula as well as other land areas of the District. A temple located on High Island (known in Chinese as Leung Shuen Wan), dates back to 1741. Sai Kung market town was expanded into the local town centre of the district after the 1950s. However, the District's population are now concentrated around the Tseung Kwan O New Town, partially built on reclaimed land in Junk Bay (or known as its Chinese name Tseung Kwan O) in the 1980s. Population and settlement Sai Kung District covers approximately land area as of 2018,size of the areas from Table E489 (2018 ed.) https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/hkstat/sub/sp150.jsp?productCode=D5320189 It had a population of 461,864 in 2016 by-census, most of it in Tseung Kwan O (398,479). Sai Kung Central election constituency, which roughly has the same boundary as Sai Kung Town planning zone, has a population of 9,623 in the same by-census. Tseung Kwan O is a new town and has multiple constituencies. However, all Tseung Kwan O constituencies are belongs to Tseung Kwan O Outline Zoning Plan in term of town planning administration. =Sai Kung Town= Sai Kung Tin Hau Temple, Sai Kung Sai Kung Town is a former fishing village and market township. The designation of the country park areas during the 1970s was a huge boost to the local tourist industry. Sai Kung town underwent significant expansion during the 1970s when the High Island Reservoir and associated water scheme required some villagers and fishermen to be rehoused in Sai Kung. This provided a core of government-funded new development, both housing and commercial, in the town centre. This was followed by the Tui Min Hoi (literal translation 'over the harbour') development under the government's market town programme. =Tseung Kwan O= Tseung Kwan O New Town In addition to Sai Kung, Tseung Kwan O, a booming new town, is also part of Sai Kung District. Tseung Kwan O connects Sai Kung Peninsula with the Kowloon urban area. Junk Bay was once a natural bay area in Sai Kung, quite near the seafood village of Lei Yue Mun. There once was an iron and steel factory, and the area around Hang Hau Village was known for its shipyards. In 1997, the Hong Kong Government started a major development project in this area, developing it into the seventh Hong Kong new town. Reclamation has since covered the whole bay area and it is now able to accommodate around 380,000 inhabitants, accounting for 95% of the district's total population. This new town was renamed Tseung Kwan O, its present name. Tseung Kwan O now includes several high-rise residential estates and an industrial estate. The MTR metro system was extended to Tseung Kwan O, facilitating access to Sai Kung District. Geography In contrast to the densely populated areas of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, Sai Kung District's heartland is a coastal area characterised by its scenery, small villages and seascapes. The area is known for its pristine beaches and quiet living. In as much as it remains only partly urbanised, Sai Kung is known as the \\"last back garden\\" of Hong Kong. =UNESCO Global Geopark & Country Parks= Po Pin Chau, a stack island near the High Island Reservoir East Dam Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region, Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region lies in Sharp Island, High Island, the Ninepin Group and the Ung Kong Group (Wang Chau, Basalt Island and Bluff Island), where volcanic rocks, intrusive rocks and world-unique acidic hexagonal volcanic columnar rock joints created by Hong Kong's last large-scale volcanic activity some 16.5 million to 14 million years ago crop out. With a host of volcanic rock coastal landforms, they form a comprehensive showcase of diverse and complex volcanic activities that explain Sai Kung's geological past. Sai Kung East Country Park Sai Kung East Country Park occupies a vast area of east Sai Kung Peninsula. With the High Island Reservoir, High Island, Tai Long Wan, Pak Tam Au, Chek Keng, Sheung Yiu, Wong Shek Pier and the surrounding countryside, the 4,494 hectare protected area consists of the largest number of bays and coves among all country parks in Hong Kong. Part of the Geopark is also located there. Sai Kung West Country Park Sai Kung East Country Park, including the Sai Kung West Country Park (Wan Tsai Extension), occupies a vast area of west Sai Kung Peninsula. Old preserved villages, such as Pak Sha O, Yung Shue O and Lai Chi Chong are the places of interest. Clear Water Bay Country Park Clear Water Bay Country Park occupies the rugged terrain around High Junk Peak in the eastern and the western part of the Clear Water Bay Peninsula.

In addition there are golf courses and nature trails. There is a golf driving range center in Ho Chung. In recent years, the government has invested heavily in Sai Kung, with improvements being made to the town seafront, such as the Waterfront Park. An attractive mix of small boutique- style shops has sprung up as well, due to a sizeable expat population and increasing numbers of local visitors, selling everything from secondhand books to cat-themed accessories, and alternative lifestyle stores that offer items like surfboards, candles, incense, seashells, etc. Transport Sai Kung Waterfront Promenade, Sai Kung, Hong Kong The MTR system's Tseung Kwan O Line currently has five stations in Tseung Kwan O New Town. The new town is also served by a comprehensive bus network that connects it to Kowloon via several main roads including Tseung Kwan O Tunnel and Po Lam Road. Hang Hau Road and Ying Yip Road link Tseung Kwan O with Sai Kung Town and Clear Water Bay. The nearest MTR station to Sai Kung Town is Hang Hau. Some isolated parts of Sai Kung Peninsula have no road access and can only be reached on foot or by boat. Where a destination is accessible by public transport, it is usually served via a network of bus routes, public light buses (i.e. minibuses) and taxis. Education The education in the Sai Kung District is administrated by the Education Bureau and not administrated by Sai Kung District Office. The latter is a division of Home Affairs Department instead. The Education Bureau has its own zoning scheme. For example, Primary One Admission School Net no.95, covers the whole Sai Kung District, as well as Sai Kung North which is part of Tai Po District.https://www.map.gov.hk/gm/map/s/poa-snb/95 The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, one of the eight publicly funded tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, is located in Clear Water Bay Road, Sai Kung District. The Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education has in Tiu Keng Leng, Tseung Kwan O. The Hong Kong Design Institute is next to the IVE Tiu Keng Leng campus. Miscellaneous * The northern half of Sai Kung Peninsula belongs to nearby Tai Po District, and not Sai Kung District. This is because communities in the northern half of Sai Kung Peninsula used to be more connected to Tai Po via kai-to sea transport before roads were built leading into this area in the 20th century. * Coincidentally, the Chinese characters \\"Ë•øË≤¢\\" for Sai Kung are also the Vietnamese Chu nom characters for the name Saigon (now called Ho Chi Minh City), a major city in Vietnam. * Media Sai Kung District is served by Sai Kung Magazine, a free-distribution English language monthly magazine and the community website Saikung.com.

Solid objects will deform when adequate loads are applied to them; if the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size after removal. This is in contrast to plasticity, in which the object fails to do so and instead remains in its deformed state. The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials. In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system). When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied. Hooke's law states that the force required to deform elastic objects should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. This is known as perfect elasticity, in which a given object will return to its original shape no matter how strongly it is deformed. This is an ideal concept only; most materials which possess elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, after which plastic (permanent) deformation occurs. In engineering, the elasticity of a material is quantified by the elastic modulus such as the Young's modulus, bulk modulus or shear modulus which measure the amount of stress needed to achieve a unit of strain; a higher modulus indicates that the material is harder to deform. The SI unit of this modulus is the pascal (Pa). The material's elastic limit or yield strength is the maximum stress that can arise before the onset of plastic deformation. Its SI unit is also the pascal (Pa). Overview When an elastic material is deformed due to an external force, it experiences internal resistance to the deformation and restores it to its original state if the external force is no longer applied. There are various elastic moduli, such as Young's modulus, the shear modulus, and the bulk modulus, all of which are measures of the inherent elastic properties of a material as a resistance to deformation under an applied load. The various moduli apply to different kinds of deformation. For instance, Young's modulus applies to extension/compression of a body, whereas the shear modulus applies to its shear.Landau LD, Lipshitz EM. Theory of Elasticity, 3rd Edition, 1970: 1‚Äì172. Young's modulus and shear modulus are only for solids, whereas the bulk modulus is for solids, liquids, and gases. The elasticity of materials is described by a stress‚Äìstrain curve, which shows the relation between stress (the average restorative internal force per unit area) and strain (the relative deformation). The curve is generally nonlinear, but it can (by use of a Taylor series) be approximated as linear for sufficiently small deformations (in which higher-order terms are negligible). If the material is isotropic, the linearized stress‚Äìstrain relationship is called Hooke's law, which is often presumed to apply up to the elastic limit for most metals or crystalline materials whereas nonlinear elasticity is generally required to model large deformations of rubbery materials even in the elastic range. For even higher stresses, materials exhibit plastic behavior, that is, they deform irreversibly and do not return to their original shape after stress is no longer applied. For rubber-like materials such as elastomers, the slope of the stress‚Äìstrain curve increases with stress, meaning that rubbers progressively become more difficult to stretch, while for most metals, the gradient decreases at very high stresses, meaning that they progressively become easier to stretch. Elasticity is not exhibited only by solids; non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic fluids, will also exhibit elasticity in certain conditions quantified by the Deborah number. In response to a small, rapidly applied and removed strain, these fluids may deform and then return to their original shape. Under larger strains, or strains applied for longer periods of time, these fluids may start to flow like a viscous liquid. Because the elasticity of a material is described in terms of a stress‚Äìstrain relation, it is essential that the terms stress and strain be defined without ambiguity. Typically, two types of relation are considered. The first type deals with materials that are elastic only for small strains. The second deals with materials that are not limited to small strains. Clearly, the second type of relation is more general in the sense that it must include the first type as a special case. For small strains, the measure of stress that is used is the Cauchy stress while the measure of strain that is used is the infinitesimal strain tensor; the resulting (predicted) material behavior is termed linear elasticity, which (for isotropic media) is called the generalized Hooke's law. Cauchy elastic materials and hypoelastic materials are models that extend Hooke's law to allow for the possibility of large rotations, large distortions, and intrinsic or induced anisotropy. For more general situations, any of a number of stress measures can be used, and it generally desired (but not required) that the elastic stress‚Äìstrain relation be phrased in terms of a finite strain measure that is work conjugate to the selected stress measure, i.e., the time integral of the inner product of the stress measure with the rate of the strain measure should be equal to the change in internal energy for any adiabatic process that remains below the elastic limit.  Linear elasticity  As noted above, for small deformations, most elastic materials such as springs exhibit linear elasticity and can be described by a linear relation between the stress and strain. This relationship is known as Hooke's law. A geometry-dependent version of the ideaDescriptions of material behavior should be independent of the geometry and shape of the object made of the material under consideration. The original version of Hooke's law involves a stiffness constant that depends on the initial size and shape of the object. The stiffness constant is therefore not strictly a material property. was first formulated by Robert Hooke in 1675 as a Latin anagram, \\"ceiiinosssttuv\\". He published the answer in 1678: \\"Ut tensio, sic vis\\" meaning \\"As the extension, so the force\\",Bigoni, D. Nonlinear Solid Mechanics: Bifurcation Theory and Material Instability. Cambridge University Press, 2012 . . a linear relationship commonly referred to as Hooke's law. This law can be stated as a relationship between tensile force and corresponding extension displacement , :F=k x, where is a constant known as the rate or spring constant. It can also be stated as a relationship between stress and strain \\\\varepsilon: :\\\\sigma = E\\\\varepsilon, where is known as the elastic modulus or Young's modulus. Although the general proportionality constant between stress and strain in three dimensions is a 4th-order tensor called stiffness, systems that exhibit symmetry, such as a one-dimensional rod, can often be reduced to applications of Hooke's law.  Finite elasticity  The elastic behavior of objects that undergo finite deformations has been described using a number of models, such as Cauchy elastic material models, Hypoelastic material models, and Hyperelastic material models. The deformation gradient (F) is the primary deformation measure used in finite strain theory. = Cauchy elastic materials = A material is said to be Cauchy-elastic if the Cauchy stress tensor œÉ is a function of the deformation gradient F alone: :\\\\ \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\mathcal{G}(\\\\boldsymbol{F}) It is generally incorrect to state that Cauchy stress is a function of merely a strain tensor, as such a model lacks crucial information about material rotation needed to produce correct results for an anisotropic medium subjected to vertical extension in comparison to the same extension applied horizontally and then subjected to a 90-degree rotation; both these deformations have the same spatial strain tensors yet must produce different values of the Cauchy stress tensor. Even though the stress in a Cauchy-elastic material depends only on the state of deformation, the work done by stresses might depend on the path of deformation. Therefore, Cauchy elasticity includes non-conservative \\"non-hyperelastic\\" models (in which work of deformation is path dependent) as well as conservative \\"hyperelastic material\\" models (for which stress can be derived from a scalar \\"elastic potential\\" function). = Hypoelastic materials = A hypoelastic material can be rigorously defined as one that is modeled using a constitutive equation satisfying the following two criteria: 1\\\\. The Cauchy stress \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} at time t depends only on the order in which the body has occupied its past configurations, but not on the time rate at which these past configurations were traversed. As a special case, this criterion includes a Cauchy elastic material, for which the current stress depends only on the current configuration rather than the history of past configurations. 2\\\\. There is a tensor-valued function G such that \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} = G(\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma},\\\\boldsymbol{L}) \\\\,, in which \\\\dot{\\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma}} is the material rate of the Cauchy stress tensor, and \\\\boldsymbol{L} is the spatial velocity gradient tensor. If only these two original criteria are used to define hypoelasticity, then hyperelasticity would be included as a special case, which prompts some constitutive modelers to append a third criterion that specifically requires a hypoelastic model to not be hyperelastic (i.e., hypoelasticity implies that stress is not derivable from an energy potential). If this third criterion is adopted, it follows that a hypoelastic material might admit nonconservative adiabatic loading paths that start and end with the same deformation gradient but do not start and end at the same internal energy. Note that the second criterion requires only that the function G exists. As detailed in the main Hypoelastic material article, specific formulations of hypoelastic models typically employ so-called objective rates so that the G function exists only implicitly and is typically needed explicitly only for numerical stress updates performed via direct integration of the actual (not objective) stress rate. = Hyperelastic materials = Hyperelastic materials (also called Green elastic materials) are conservative models that are derived from a strain energy density function (W). A model is hyperelastic if and only if it is possible to express the Cauchy stress tensor as a function of the deformation gradient via a relationship of the form : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\cfrac{1}{J}~ \\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{F}}\\\\boldsymbol{F}^T \\\\quad \\\\text{where} \\\\quad J := \\\\det\\\\boldsymbol{F} \\\\,. This formulation takes the energy potential (W) as a function of the deformation gradient (\\\\boldsymbol{F}). By also requiring satisfaction of material objectivity, the energy potential may be alternatively regarded as a function of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor (\\\\boldsymbol{C}:=\\\\boldsymbol{F}^T\\\\boldsymbol{F}), in which case the hyperelastic model may be written alternatively as : \\\\boldsymbol{\\\\sigma} = \\\\cfrac{2}{J}~ \\\\boldsymbol{F}\\\\cfrac{\\\\partial W}{\\\\partial \\\\boldsymbol{C}}\\\\boldsymbol{F}^T \\\\quad \\\\text{where} \\\\quad J := \\\\det\\\\boldsymbol{F} \\\\,.  Applications  Linear elasticity is used widely in the design and analysis of structures such as beams, plates and shells, and sandwich composites. This theory is also the basis of much of fracture mechanics. Hyperelasticity is primarily used to determine the response of elastomer-based objects such as gaskets and of biological materials such as soft tissues and cell membranes. Factors affecting elasticity For isotropic materials, the presence of fractures affects the Young and the shear moduli perpendicular to the planes of the cracks, which decrease (Young's modulus faster than the shear modulus) as the fracture density increases, indicating that the presence of cracks makes bodies brittler. Microscopically, the stress‚Äìstrain relationship of materials is in general governed by the Helmholtz free energy, a thermodynamic quantity. Molecules settle in the configuration which minimizes the free energy, subject to constraints derived from their structure, and, depending on whether the energy or the entropy term dominates the free energy, materials can broadly be classified as energy- elastic and entropy-elastic. As such, microscopic factors affecting the free energy, such as the equilibrium distance between molecules, can affect the elasticity of materials: for instance, in inorganic materials, as the equilibrium distance between molecules at 0 K increases, the bulk modulus decreases. The effect of temperature on elasticity is difficult to isolate, because there are numerous factors affecting it. For instance, the bulk modulus of a material is dependent on the form of its lattice, its behavior under expansion, as well as the vibrations of the molecules, all of which are dependent on temperature.

He was convicted and executed for regicide. Life He was the son of Jacob Johan Anckarstr√∂m the Elder and Hedvig Ulrika Drufva. He married Gustaviana Elisabet L√∂wen (1764-1844) in 1783, and had two daughters and two sons: Gustafva Eleonora L√∂wenstr√∂m (1785-1860), Carolina Lovisa, Johan Jacob and Carl David. Anckarstr√∂m served as a page at court and then as a captain in King Gustav III's regiment between 1778 and 1783. During travels to Gotland, he was accused of slandering the king and fled to Stockholm, where he spent the winter; he was subsequently arrested, brought back, and tried in Gotland. Although he was acquitted due to lack of evidence, he later maintained in his confession that this incident sparked his fire of hatred towards the king, fuelled by the contemporary revolutionary movement in Europe. Drawing of Anckarstr√∂m being flogged thumb The Swedish nobles were about this time violently opposed to the king, who, by the aid of the other orders of the state, had wrested their power from them and was now ruling despotically. This dislike was increased by the coup d'√©tat of 1789 and by the king's known desire to interfere in favor of Louis XVIII in France. Anckarstr√∂m, a man of strong passions and violent temper, resolved upon the assassination of Gustav and communicated his intention to other disaffected nobles, including Counts Horn and Ribbing. Initial attempts to seize the king were failures. =The murder= On 16 March 1792, Gustav III had returned to Stockholm, after spending the day at Haga Palace outside the city, to dine and visit a masquerade ball at the Royal Opera. During dinner, the king received an anonymous letter (written by the colonel of the Life Guards, Carl Pontus Lilliehorn) that contained a threat to his life, but as the king had received numerous threatening letters in the past, he chose to ignore the warning. After dining, the king with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen at his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The king, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor towards the scene where several dancers and masked men filled the tiles. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the king, who then turned backwards to talk to Pollet. Anckarstr√∂m stood at the entrance to the corridor and edged himself behind the king, took out a pistol from his left inner pocket and pulled the trigger. Because of the king turning backwards the shot went in at an angle left of the third lumbar vertebrae towards the left hip region. The shot consisted of two bullets, furniture tacks and bits of lead clippings; Anckarstr√∂m later confessed that the composition of the shot was intended to be as lethal as possible.High Court protocols, 1792 The king twitched and said ‚Äúai‚Äù without falling. Anckarstr√∂m then lost courage; he had thought that the king would fall directly. Bewildered, Anckarstr√∂m dropped the pistol and knife on the floor, took a few steps and shouted fire. He quickly went towards the entrance, but the guard had already closed the doors. Despondent, he hid his second pistol and mixed with the crowd. His intention had been to shoot himself with the second pistol. Witnesses told the court that Anckarstr√∂m had been agitated and asked if the king was badly wounded. All guests at the masquerade were forced to give their names before leaving the house.High Court protocols, 1792 In the 19th Century the history of the assassination was embellished upon, embellishments that still are taken as facts today.Anon., 1844Elkan, 1910Lindqvist, 2000 Most notably is the tale of how one of the conspirators (often Claes Fredrik Horn) taps the king on the shoulder and saying ‚Äúbonsoir, beau masque‚Äù (Good evening, beautiful masque) to point out Anckarstr√∂m's target. The other embellishment would be that the king was shot at a certain point in a counter dance, ‚ÄúPlaisir de Gr√∂ns√∂√∂‚Äù. The conductor, so the legend goes, marked the sound of the shot in his notes and the music stopped. But the court records show that few people noticed the shot and the music continued playing for some time afterwards.Sv√§rdstr√∂m, 1967 Anckarstr√∂m's pistols, legend aside, were brought around to several gunsmiths the next morning and one who had repaired them for Anckarstr√∂m recognized them and identified him as their owner. Anckarstr√∂m was arrested the same morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until he was informed that Horn and Ribbing had been arrested and confessed in full.High Court protocols, 1792 Anckarstr√∂m was jailed in a prison not far from the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Today the former prison is an underground restaurant named after the viceroy Sten Sture. Curiously, the murder had been predicted to the king four years earlier, when he paid an anonymous visit to the celebrated medium of the Gustavian era, Ulrica Arfvidsson. She was often employed by his brother, Duke Charles, and was said to have a large net of informers all over town; she was never suspected to be involved, but she was questioned about the murder. In 1791, Charlotta Roos also predicted misfortune to King Gustav III, something he reportedly referred to on his death bed after the assassination. =Execution= Gustav III died of his wounds on 29 March and on 16 April Anckarstr√∂m was sentenced. He was stripped of his estates and nobility privileges. He was sentenced to be cast in irons for three days and publicly flogged, his right hand to be cut off, his head removed, and his corpse quartered. The execution took place on 27 April 1792. He endured his sufferings with the greatest fortitude, and seemed to rejoice in having rid his country of a tyrant. His principal accomplices Ribbing and Horn were stripped of titles and estates and expelled from the country.Hig Court protocols, 1792 =Aftermath= In the same year, the Anckarstr√∂m family changed its surname to L√∂wenstr√∂m and donated funds for a hospital as a gift of appeasement. This resulted in the L√∂wenstr√∂m Hospital, or L√∂wenstr√∂mska lasarettet in Upplands V√§sby north of Stockholm. Living descendants of Anckarstr√∂m include Ulf Adelsohn, and solo sailor Sven Yrvind. Operas Anckarstr√∂m is a character in Daniel Auber's opera Gustave III and Giuseppe Verdi's Un ballo in maschera (A Masked Ball). In the operas, his motivation is changed to jealousy over his wife Amelia, with whom Gustav is portrayed as being in love. He is actually portrayed as being Gustav's close friend before he switches allegiances. Gustav pardons him with his last breath. In the censored version of the Verdi libretto, set in Colonial-era Boston, he is called Renato (Rene).  References  =Citations= =Bibliography=   .

Membership is approximately 70,000 . The PSA represents members on workplace issues, negotiates collective employment agreements and advocates for strong public services. The PSA is affiliated to the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Public Services International. History Though its origins go back to 1890, The New Zealand Public Service Association officially dates from 31 October 1913. The early history of the PSA is one of dogged resistance to cuts in pay and conditions. Public servants were poorly paid and were often forced to take pay cuts when the economy stalled. In 1931, for example, all public servant salaries were cut by 10%. Many public servants suffered acute hardship. It was only loans from the Public Service Investment Society, set up by the PSA in 1928, that prevented many of them falling into the clutches of loans sharks. Working conditions were sometimes poor and unhygienic. An overcrowded Wellington department was described by the PSA as \\"a compromise between a hot- house and a tin shed erected by amateur carpenters\\". With a change of government in 1936, the PSA began to have some success with its advocacy for public servants. A five-day working week for public servants was introduced. Salaries were restored to 1931 levels, and public servants given the right to become politically involved. By mid-century, the PSA was a confident, energetic organisation. In 1950 membership was nearly 30,000, 83% of the total public service roll. A major focus of the 1950s was discrimination against women, which was built into the salary scales. By the end of the decade the PSA advocacy had borne fruit, with the passing of Government Service Equal Pay Act. A PSA rally in 2010 during a dispute with Housing New Zealand By the 1970s the PSA was again in resistance mode as pressure came on public sector pay as a result of an economic downturn. It was a decade of political turbulence and industrial unrest. In 1979 the PSA faced the biggest crisis in its existence. In response to notice of strike action by electricity workers, the Government introduced the Public Service Association Withdrawal of Recognition Bill. The bill would have given the Government the power of seize all the assets of the union and vest them in the Public Trustee. In the face of mass protests and a PSA offer to submit the dispute to mediation, the Government backed down and withdrew the bill. The 1980s presented more challenges. Privatisation of state assets and the restructuring of the public service saw thousands of PSA members made redundant. In 1987 the Government introduced the State Sector Bill which would have taken away most of the current conditions of employment. PSA members held massive protest meetings and a national strike in 1988. This ensured all current conditions were saved. The early 1990s saw further attacks on unions. The Employment Contracts Act removed unions as a legal entity; unions were now called bargaining agents with very restricted rights. In the late 1990s, the PSA began looking at ways to break out of the negative relationships which were so common in the workplace at that time. It worked with the Government and State Services Commission to reassess and rebuild a public service decimated by a decade of economic reforms. It developed a new strategy, Partnership for Quality, which sought constructive engagement with government and employers. In 2000, the first Quality for Partnership Agreement was signed by the PSA and the Government. Though the current government has chosen not to enter into a formal partnership with the PSA, the union remains committed to constructive engagement at all levels of government and with employers. The PSA continues to be an effective voice for its members. In 2006 the union negotiated national pay rates for occupational groups in the health sector and has been successful in breaking the de facto wage freeze imposed on the public service with wage settlements in a number of large departments. In 2010 the union successfully negotiated a collective employment agreement for its 6000 local government members in Auckland when eight councils and a large number of council-controlled organisations were amalgamated into a single Auckland council. Despite continuous cuts and restructuring in the public sector and legislation aimed at reducing the effectiveness of unions, PSA membership continues to grow, particularly in community-based services. Strategy PSA strategy revolves round the principles of fair pay, decent working environments and employees having a real voice in management decision-making. The PSA is committed to constructive engagement with government and employers at all levels. It promotes/advocates efficient and effective workplaces and systems that maximise public value. The PSA is not affiliated with any political party. Campaigns The PSA is currently advancing a number of campaigns. Up Where We Belong ‚Äì raising awareness of the work of disability support services and the need for adequate funding. Bargaining ‚Äì seeking fair and equitable pay and transparent pay systems. The PSA also endorses campaigns that support workers' rights and better communities. Current campaigns include Fairness@Work, ACC Futures Coalition and Pay Equity Challenge Coalition. Structure of the PSA alt=PSA House in WellingtonThe PSA is a democratic union with members involved in policy decisions at every level. Annual Members' Meetings elect the nearly 4000 delegates who represent the union in workplaces. PSA members are grouped into five sectors. Each sector has a sector delegates' committee. The elected convenor of each sector is on the executive board which oversees policy implementation and the efficient use of resources. The executive appoints the secretariat that is responsible for management and day-to-day leadership of the union. The secretariat currently comprises two national secretaries. The PSA has more than 130 staff in 10 locations across New Zealand. A staff representative sits on the executive board. Policy and the overall direction of the union are set by the PSA National Delegates' Congress held every two years. Congress elects the national president who chairs the executive board. The PSA structure reflects the unique place of Maori in New Zealand society. As tangata whenua (indigenous people) with a special status conferred by the nation's founding document, Te Tiriti ≈ç Waitangi. Te Tiriti ≈ç Waitangi, Maori are represented in the PSA (Te P≈´kenga Here Tikanga Mahi) through Te R≈´nanga o NgƒÅ Toa ƒÄwhina ‚Äì the national body representing the interests of Maori members. Te R≈´nanga o NgƒÅ Toa ƒÄwhina has two representatives on each of the sector committees and the convenor of the R≈´nanga committee is a member of the executive board. Membership fees PSA membership is open to anyone who works in a New Zealand public agency. This includes all government departments, crown entities, district health boards, local government, state- owned enterprises and non-governmental and community organisations providing public services. Membership fees are based on gross annual salary. Fees can vary from $4.40 to $18.00 per fortnight.

This book, described in its introduction as a \\"sequel\\" to Spengler's The Decline of the West, argues for a culture-based, totalitarian path for the preservation of Western culture.ADL Research Report 'Poisoning the Airwaves: The Extremist Message of Hate on Shortwave Radio' U.S. Newswire February 1, 1996 Yockey actively supported many far-right causes around the world and remains one of the seminal influences of many white nationalist and New Right movements. Yockey was a passionate proponent of antisemitism, and expressed a reverence for German Nazism, and a general affinity for fascist causes. Yockey contacted or worked with the Nazi-aligned Silver Shirts and the German- American Bund. After the defeat of the Axis in World War II, Yockey became even more active in neo-Fascist causes. Yockey believed that the United States was an engine of liberalism, controlled by Zionist Jews. Yockey also met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, and wrote anti-Zionist propaganda on behalf of the Egyptian government, seeing the pan-Arab nationalist movement as another ally to challenge \\"the Jewish-American power.\\" While in prison for falsified passports, he was visited by American right-winger Willis Carto, who ultimately became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's writings. Early life Many biographical facts about Yockey cannot be known with absolute certainty. The majority comes from the accounts of those who knew him and from FBI efforts to gain intelligence in regard to his activities, as recorded by his biographer Kevin Coogan in his book Dreamer of the Day: Francis Parker Yockey and the Postwar Fascist International. Yockey was born in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of four siblings. Before becoming a devotee of elitist and anti-materialist Oswald Spengler, he briefly flirted with Marxism. Aside from Spengler, he was heavily influenced by the ideas of German legal scholar Carl Schmitt. Like Spengler, he rejected the strict biological view of race, instead preferring a spiritual conception of race married with Karl Haushofer's idea of geopolitics; but unlike Spengler, who disregarded the Nazis for being too bourgeois and anti-Semitic, Yockey believed in German National Socialism, and supported various Fascist and neo-Fascist causes for the remainder of his life, including anti-Semitism. As a university student in the late 1930s, Yockey had his first political essay published in Social Justice, a periodical distributed by Fr. Charles Coughlin, known as the \\"radio priest,\\" At the time Coughlin was widely known for his sympathetic view of the anti-Bolshevist policies associated with Adolf Hitler's Germany, Benito Mussolini's Italy, and Gen. Franco's Spain. Yockey attended at least seven universities. He studied for two years (1934‚Äì1936) as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, and then transferred to Georgetown's School of Foreign Service. He completed his undergraduate degree at the University of Arizona, and graduated cum laude from the Notre Dame Law School in 1941. Later life and works Over time, Yockey contacted or worked with many of the far-right figures and organizations of his day. These included the German-American Bund, the National German-American Alliance, William Dudley Pelley's Silver Shirts, Sir Oswald Mosley's Union Movement, George Sylvester Viereck, the American H. Keith Thompson, Gerald L. K. Smith, and James H. Madole's National Renaissance Party. After the war Thompson and Madole became advocates of Yockey's worldview and published some of his essays. While Yockey's pro-Fascist activities began in the late 1930s, they did not end there. Unfazed by the defeat of the Axis in the Second World War, Yockey actually became even more active in neo-Fascist causes after 1945. From this point forward, he remained dedicated solely to his cause of reviving Fascism. He dispensed with any semblance of an ordinary life, and remained constantly on the move, travelling to wherever he felt he could pursue his goals most effectively, and cultivating countless contacts along the way. Yockey's ideas were usually embraced only by those, however, who could countenance the necessity of an alliance between the far Left and the far Right, which was a fundamental pillar of Yockey's ideas. The American Nazi Party of George Lincoln Rockwell, for example, rejected Yockey on the basis of his anti-American attitude, as well as his willingness to work with anti-Zionist Communist governments and movements, as the ANP adhered solely to the ideals of absolute anti-Bolshevist National Socialism, as had been advocated by Hitler. (Yockey, however, seems to have remained unaware of Rockwell, as he told Willis Carto that he had never heard of the ANP when Carto visited him in prison in 1960.) Other proponents of Universal Nazism, such as Rockwell's ally Colin Jordan, disagreed with Yockey's views on race, and saw Yockeyism as advocating a kind of \\"New Strasserism\\" which would undermine true Nazism. In early 1946, Yockey began working for the United States War Department as a post-trial review attorney for the Nuremberg Trials in Germany. He soon began agitating against Allied occupation of Germany, as well as what he perceived to be the biased procedures of the Nuremberg tribunal. Eventually, he was fired for \\"abandonment of position\\" in November 1946. Without notes, Yockey wrote his first book, Imperium: The Philosophy of History and Politics, in Brittas Bay, Ireland over the winter and early spring of 1948. It is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century materialism and rationalism. It is dedicated to 'The hero of the twentieth century'; allegedly, he intended that description to apply to Adolf Hitler.Theodore J. O'Keefe of the Journal of Historical Review makes this assertion in his review of Kevin Coggan's 1999 study of Yockey. According to the late Doris Foster Lessard, an historian for many years in Ludington, Michigan, this information about Imperium was apparently known to Ludington residents of Yockey's parents' social circle. In a rebuttal to the accusations of Arnold Leese, Yockey stated that the \\"hero\\" of which he spoke was indeed Hitler. The views expressed in Imperium were endorsed by far-Right thinkers around the world including former German General Otto Remer; Professor of Classics at the University of Illinois, Revilo P. Oliver; and Italian esotericist Julius Evola. Yockey became embittered with Sir Oswald Mosley after the latter refused to publish or review Imperium upon its completion, after having promised to do so. Guy Chesham, one of the leaders of Mosley's movement, actually resigned from it, in part because of Mosley's treatment of Yockey. Imperium subscribes to Spengler's suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the 'Roman' role in Western Civilization by uniting all its constituent states into one large empire.Brief Review of \\"Imperium\\" Along with former Mosleyites Guy Chesham and John Gannon, Yockey formed the European Liberation Front (ELF) in 1948‚Äì49. The ELF issued a newsletter, Frontfighter, and published Yockey's virulent anti-American, anti-communist and anti-semitic text The Proclamation of London.The Proclamation of London, full text In Yockey's view, \\"social decay\\" was permeated by the Jew, who as a \\"Culture- distorter\\" and a \\"bearer of Culture-disease\\", \\"instinctively allied himself with all forms, theories, doctrines and practices of decadence in every sphere of life\\". \\"America is [the Jew and the liberal-communist-democrat]'s program in process of actualization, and its example shows Europe what the liberal- communist-democratic regime of Culture-distortion is preparing for it during the coming generations\\". Yockey was also approached by the group around the anti-Communist Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1951. He was asked to ghost-write a speech for McCarthy which stressed the importance of greater friendship between Germany and the United States, although McCarthy never delivered it as the theme of the speech, when it was announced, aroused a great deal of controversy. In late 1952, Yockey traveled to Prague and witnessed the Prague Trials. He believed they \\"foretold a Russian break with Jewry\\", a view he put forward in his article What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?.What is Behind the Hanging of the Eleven Jews in Prague?, full text Indeed, that prediction was vindicated by the fact that the last Jewish member of the Soviet Presidium, Lazar Kaganovich, was expelled in 1957 ‚Äì having been sidelined as early as 1953. (In addition, after sympathizing with Israel in its 1948‚Äì49 war, the USSR switched sides and supported Arabs in subsequent conflicts.) Yockey believed that Stalinism had purged Soviet Communism of Jewish influence. He spent the remainder of his life attempting to forge an alliance between the worldwide forces of Communism and the international network of the extreme Right of which he was a part, with an aim toward weakening or overthrowing the government of the United States. Yockey met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom he called \\"a great and vigorous man\\", in Cairo in 1953. He worked briefly for the Egyptian Information Ministry, writing anti-Zionist propaganda. Yockey saw the rise of non-aligned states in the Third World, and in particular Arab nationalism, as significant geopolitical challenges to \\"the Jewish-American power\\". Some speculate that Yockey made clandestine trips during the 1950s into East Germany, and possibly even into the USSR itself, attempting to cultivate Communist ties. Arrest and death Yockey was continuously pursued by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for over a decade, which he avoided by adopting numerous aliases. He was finally arrested in 1960 after returning to the United States from abroad, as his suitcase was sent to the wrong airport. When the authorities opened it to determine whose suitcase it was, they discovered several of Yockey's falsified passports and birth certificates. When this was reported to the federal government, the FBI tracked him down in Oakland, California and arrested him. While in prison, he was visited by the American Rightist Willis Carto, who later became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey's ideas. Yockey was soon after found dead with an empty cyanide capsule nearby while in a jail cell in San Francisco under FBI supervision, leaving a note in which he claimed that he was committing suicide in order to protect the anonymity of his political contacts. Impact of ideas Yockey was rather unusual among thinkers of the far-right post-Second World War. Most European and American neo-Fascists and other rightists of the post-war period advocated an alliance with the United States as the best hope for the survival of Western culture under the threat of communism, but Yockey felt that an alliance of the right with the left was a far more desirable course. This proposed alliance is referred to as a Red-Brown Alliance (the color red representing the far-left and the color brown representing the far-right). Yockey felt that American universalism, democracy, and consumer culture, which was by then spreading into western Europe and much of the rest of the world, as well as its alliance with Zionism, was far more corrosive and deadly to the true spirit of the West than was the Soviet Union. Yockey believed that the USSR had become genuinely anti-Zionist under Joseph Stalin, that in its authoritarianism it preserved something of the traditional European concept of hierarchy, and he felt it could more easily be adapted to a rightist orientation over time than was possible in the egalitarian United States. He thus believed that true rightists should aid the spread of communism and Third World anti-colonial movements wherever possible, and he remained staunchly opposed to the government and culture of the United States, which he did not even consider to be truly Western in nature. Legacy Yockey himself did not have a very significant influence on the American Right, however, which, throughout the Cold War, for the most part remained staunchly anti-Communist and liberal. He had a much greater impact in Europe, where intellectuals of the Right, especially the current of thought sometimes called the European New Right, including the Belgian Jean Thiriart, the Russian Aleksandr Dugin, and French writers Alain de Benoist and Guillaume Faye, adopted positions similar to Yockey's, although there is little evidence his work influenced them in this. Yockey's present influence is reflected mostly through the work of Willis Carto and his Liberty Lobby and successor organizations. Carto ran the Youth for George Wallace group supporting segregationist George Wallace's 1968 presidential campaign. That group formed the basis for the National Youth Alliance, which promoted Yockey's political philosophy and his book Imperium. Many supporters of Yockey, such as H. Keith Thompson, claim that Carto failed to understand Yockey's ideas on their deepest level. In his 2011 book of correspondences with American conductor David Woodard, Swiss writer Christian Kracht highly recommends Yockey's Imperium.Kracht, C., & Woodard, D., Five Years (Hanover: Wehrhahn Verlag, 2011), p. 139. The following year, Kracht published his bestselling novel Imperium.

Schramm, usually referred to as \\"Tex\\", became the head of the Cowboys when the former expansion team started operations in 1960. Early life and career Despite his name, Schramm was not born in Texas, but in San Gabriel, California. Texas was his father's name and where his parents met. Schramm attended Alhambra High School and went to the University of Texas, graduating in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. At UT he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as was his father. Schramm interrupted his education to serve as an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II. Before joining the Cowboys, Schramm was part of the Los Angeles Rams from 1947 to 1956. During his tenure, he hired Pete Rozelle as the Rams' public relations director; Rozelle later became one of the most important commissioners in the history of the NFL. They remained close friends after Rozelle became NFL commissioner and Schramm became general manager of the Cowboys (each holding his position for 29 years). Dallas Cowboys In late 1959, when it became apparent that the NFL was intent on expanding to Dallas, Schramm told his friends in football that he was interested in running the team. Chicago Bears owner George Halas introduced Schramm to Clint Murchison Jr., who had tried to bring the NFL to Dallas several times in the past. Murchison hired Schramm as the general manager for a potential Dallas team, which became a reality when the league awarded a franchise to the city on January 28, 1960. In 1960, Schramm hired head coach Tom Landry and chief scout Gil Brandt. By the mid-1960s, the three men had built the Cowboys into an elite team. The Cowboys, despite two consecutive losses to the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game in 1966 and '67, had 20 consecutive winning seasons, and won the most games of any NFL team of the 1970s. They appeared in five Super Bowls that decade, winning Super Bowls VI and XII, and losing Super Bowls V, X, and XIII by a combined 11 points. The Cowboys became a marquee NFL franchise, their popularity inspiring the nickname \\"America's Team\\". In 1966, Schramm met secretly with American Football League (AFL) founder Lamar Hunt to begin the negotiations that led to the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL, as well as the first Super Bowl in 1967. Schramm was known as the most powerful general manager in the NFL. The Cowboys' owners during his tenure, Murchison (1960‚Äì84) and Bum Bright (1984‚Äì1988), largely left day-to-day operations in his hands. Schramm represented the Cowboys at league meetings and exercised the team's voting rights, something normally reserved for team owners. Schramm was a leading opponent of the 1987 NFLPA Strike. The NFL players union at the time were agitating for a better deal, including free agency rights. Schramm, with other owners, organized the hiring of replacement players while the usual players were on strike, earning a nickname of \\"the commissioner of replacement football\\". Schramm cattily said to executive director of the NFLPA Gene Upshaw \\"Gene, here‚Äôs what you have to understand: we're the ranchers and you're the cattle, and we can always get more cattle.\\" Schramm was comparatively effective in convincing regular players of the Cowboys to cross the picket line, albeit at the cost of splitting the team; he aggressively used contract clauses as threats to revoke millions of dollars in annuity payments from players who would not return to work. Running back Tony Dorsett, who had previously criticized other team members for breaking the strike, felt he was financially forced to rejoin as well by Schramm's threats. Eventually 21 Cowboys players would break the strike and play with replacement players, a much higher rate than for other teams in the League; the Cowboys went 2-1 during the three strike-affected games. The cost of Schramm's threats to the team's success was high: The Cowboys would only go 8-35 over the next two and a half seasons, not recovering until new ownership took over. Innovations Schramm was known for advocating for a number of changes and innovations that helped modernize the NFL. These include instant replay, using computer technology in scouting, multi-color striping of the 20- and 50-yard lines, 30-second clock between plays, extra-wide sideline borders, wind-direction stripes on the goal post uprights, the referee's microphone, headsets in the quarterback's helmet for hearing plays, and the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. While leading the league's Competition Committee, he oversaw rule changes such as using overtime in the regular season, putting the official time on the scoreboard, moving goalposts from the front of the end zone to the back, and protecting quarterbacks through the in-the-grasp rule. Schramm's desire for a more comprehensive scouting combine led to the annual offseason NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. Don Shula said of Schramm, \\"I truly believe he had as much, or more, to do with the success of professional football as anyone who has ever been connected with the league.\\" After the Cowboys Schramm stayed on only briefly with the Cowboys after Jerry Jones purchased the team and fired Tom Landry. He left to become the president of the World League of American Football. Schramm was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991. Schramm's entry into the Cowboys Ring of Honor took much longer due to strained relations with Jones. Schramm had created the Ring of Honor, and had been a \\"one-man committee\\" on inductions. Jones became that \\"committee\\" when he took over. Finally in 2003, Jones announced that Schramm would be inducted into the ring during the next football season. Schramm attended the announcement press conference and spoke, but died a few months later and was inducted posthumously. Schramm married his high school sweetheart, Martha Anne Snowden, in 1941. Martha Schramm died on December 8, 2002. The couple had three daughters.

The \\"Lambing Flat\\" Post Office opened on 1 March 1861 and was renamed \\"Young\\" in 1863. Young is marketed as the Cherry Capital of Australia and every year hosts the National Cherry Festival. Young is situated on the Olympic Highway and is approximately 2 hours drive from the Canberra area. It is in a valley, with surrounding hills. The town is named after Sir John Young, the governor of NSW from 1861 to 1867. History Brass breast plate presented to the Aboriginal leader Coborn Jackey of the Burrowmunditory tribe by the squatter James White. The artifact is held in the museum at Young. St Mary's Catholic Church Before European settlers arrived in Young, members of the Burrowmunditory tribe, a family group of the indigenous Wiradjuri Nation, lived in the region. Descendants of the Burrowmunditory clan still live in Young. James White was the first European settler in the district and established Burrangong Station in 1826 with a squatting claim of . His story is told in the novel Brothers in Exile. Gold was found in the district in 1860. Until that time the area was called Lambing Flat, a reference to the grazing of sheep that was the main industry until mining. The town was gazetted in 1861. The goldfields produced of gold sent by escort from the fields. Up to 20,000 miners worked the fields including about 2,000 Chinese miners. From November 1860 through to June 1861, anti-Chinese miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area, now known as the infamous Lambing Flat riots. As gold became scarce, European miners began to resent what they saw as the greater success of the more industrious Chinese, and hence many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. The anti- Chinese rebels rallied in numbers of up to 3,000. Eventually the rioters were controlled, Chinese miners had their claims restored to them, but the New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill which restricted the number of Chinese that could be brought into New South Wales on any ship and imposed a tax per head on entry. In 1889 Young was the first town in Australia to install electricity into the streets and homes of the township; Tamworth NSW had installed electricity to the streets only the previous year. The former Young Shire was acknowledged as the first Local Government Area to institute a rural school bus system in New South Wales. Heritage listings Young has a number of heritage-listed sites, including: * Blayney-Harden railway: Young railway station * Lynch Street: City Bank building * Whiteman Avenue: Blackguard Gully Climate Owing to Young's far western location, it yields hot, dry summers and cool, damp winters; reflecting a distinctly \\"continental\\" climate of the South West Slopes region. Snow falls occasionally; notwithstanding its fairly low elevation of approximately 400 m, the windward position of Young exposes it to strong south-westerly frontal systems. Thus, places such as Goulburn farther east (but higher up) receive less winter moisture than Young, due to more adequate sheltering from these fronts. Climate data is sourced from Young Airport; at an elevation of and operating since 1988. Demographics On night, 9 August 2016, there were 7,170 people (3,385 males and 3,783 females) counted in Young.

The Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens attacked Chinese miners at Lambing Flat in June 1861. The banner is now on display in the museum at Young. Young Shire Council established the Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens adjacent to the site of Chinamans Dam, an old railway dam approximately south of Young. The gardens are intended to create an ambience similar to the Japanese Gardens at Cowra. Chinamans Dam, with an initial capacity of over when it was in railway use, is situated at a hamlet called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. The dam was built in the 1860s by Dutch brothers, Herman and John Tiedemann, to provide water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. At some time in the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site. The dam was used as a railway facility from 1882 when the NSW Railway Commissioners gave notice of the intention to build the first part of the Blayney-Demondrille railway. To provide water for its steam locomotives, the Commissioners decided to provide a dam and pump water from it to a facility, known as Young Tank, at the post. It is not known whether the railways enhanced the existing dam or built a new facility. From 1885 to 1901, locomotives stopped at Young Tank to replenish their water. In 1901, watering facilities were built at Young Station. The supply of water was obtained from Chinamans Dam. The capacity of the dam was enlarged in 1911. The dam was a popular spot for swimming and, whilst officially frowned upon, was tolerated. Following the connection to the South West Tablelands Water Supply Scheme, which provided water from Burrinjuck Dam, the railways ceased to draw water from Chinamans Dam after 1936. The site was returned to the Crown in 1962 and in the following year, a reserve was established and the Shire Council were appointed as trustees. The dam has since been enlarged.

It is the territory's second-oldest university and was founded as a federation of three existing colleges ‚Äì Chung Chi College, New Asia College and United College ‚Äì the oldest of which was founded in 1949. CUHK is organized into nine constituent colleges and eight academic faculties, and remains the only collegiate university in the territory. The university operates in both English and Chinese, although classes in most colleges are taught in English. Four Nobel laureates are associated with the university, and it is the only tertiary institution in Hong Kong with recipients of the Nobel Prize, Turing Award, Fields Medal and Veblen Prize sitting as faculty in residence. History =Origins= The university was formed in 1963 as a federation of three existing colleges. The first of these, New Asia College, was established in 1949 by anti-Communist Confucian scholars from Mainland China amid the revolution there. Among the founders were Ch'ien Mu, Tang Junyi, and Tchang Pi-kai. Curriculum focused particularly on Chinese heritage and social concerns. The early years of this school were tumultuous, with the campus relocating several times between rented premises around Kowloon. Academics there were often self-exiled from the mainland and they struggled financially, with students sometimes sleeping on rooftops and teachers foregoing pay to sustain the college. Funds were gradually raised and the school moved to a new campus in Kau Pui Lung, built with the support of the Ford Foundation, in 1956. Former campus of New Asia College in Sham Shui Po Following the Communist revolution and the breakdown in relations between China and the United States at the 1950 outbreak of the Korean War, all Christian colleges and universities in the People's Republic of China were shut down. Chung Chi College was founded in 1951 by Protestant churches in Hong Kong to continue the theological education of mainland churches and schools. The 63 students of its first year operating were taught in various church and rented premises on Hong Kong Island. The college moved to its present location in Ma Liu Shui (i.e., the present CUHK campus) in 1956. By 1962, a year before the founding of CUHK, Chung Chi had 531 students in 10 departments taught by a full-time faculty of 40, excluding tutors. United College was founded in 1956 with the merging of five private colleges in Guangdong province: Canton Overseas, Kwang Hsia, Wah Kiu, Wen Hua, and Ping Jing College of Accountancy. The first school president was Dr F.I. Tseung. The original campus on Caine Road on Hong Kong Island accommodated over 600 students. These three colleges (along with some others created during this era) helped fill a void in the post-secondary education options available to Hong Kong Chinese students. Before 1949, such students could attend a university in the mainland. But with this option spoiled by the upheavals in China, students were unable to further their studies at a university unless their English proficiency was sufficient to enrol at the University of Hong Kong, then the only university in the territory. In 1957, New Asia College, Chung Chi College, and United College came together to establish the Chinese Colleges Joint Council. =Foundation= A view of the campus in Ma Liu Shui In June 1959, the Hong Kong government expressed its intent to establish a new university with a medium of instruction of Chinese. The same year, the Post- Secondary Colleges Ordinance was announced to provide government funding and official recognition to New Asia, Chung Chi and United colleges in hopes that the money would \\"enable them to raise their standards to a level at which they might qualify for university status, probably on a federal basis\\". The ordinance was enacted on 19 May 1960. The Chinese University Preparatory Committee was established in June 1961 to advise the government on possible sites for the new university. The following May, the Fulton Commission was formed to assess the suitability of the three government-funded Post-Secondary Colleges to become constituent colleges of the new university. The commission, headed by Vice-Chancellor John Fulton of the newly established University of Sussex, visited Hong Kong over the summer and produced an interim report recommending the establishment of the federal university comprising the three colleges. The Fulton Commission report was tabled in the Legislative Council in June 1963, and the Chinese University of Hong Kong Ordinance was passed in September of that year. The school was officially inaugurated in a ceremony at City Hall on 17 October 1963, officiated by the founding chancellor, Sir Robert Brown Black. The next year, Dr. Li Choh-ming was appointed the first Vice-Chancellor of the university. The university originally comprised the Faculty of Arts, Faculty of Science and Faculty of Social Science. Construction began at the site of the new campus in the Ma Liu Shui area, where Chung Chi College was already established, for new facilities to house central administration and the relocated New Asia and United colleges. =1963‚Äìpresent= Construction of the new campus continued throughout the 1960s to a development plan produced by W. Szeto and Partners. Above the valley occupied by Chung Chi College, on two plateaux formed by granite quarrying for the Plover Cove dam, the quarters for the other two colleges would flank the Central Campus housing administrative buildings and other shared facilities. Some of the most iconic buildings on campus, like the University Library, were built in this period along the monumental axis of the University Mall in the subdued concrete aesthetic for which the school is known. The School of Education, which would later become a faculty, was founded in 1965. The Graduate School, the first in Hong Kong, was founded in 1966 and the first batch of master's degrees were awarded the following year. View from Chung Chi, toward New Asia College on the summit In the early 1970s, New Asia and United College moved into their new premises on the highest plateau of the campus. The Student Union was established in 1971. The School of Medicine was founded in 1977 and the teaching hospital, the Prince of Wales Hospital in nearby Sha Tin New Town, was established several years later. The university constitution was also reviewed in the 1970s with an aim to assess the school's growth and chart its future. In 1975 the chancellor appointed an external commission, again chaired by Lord Fulton, to review the university constitution. Aside from Fulton, the commission comprised I.C.M. Maxwell (its secretary), Sir Michael Herries, and Professor C.K. Yang. The commission held five days of filmed hearings to garner comments from stakeholders. This second Fulton Report recommended that academic policy, finances, matriculation of students, appointment of staff, curriculum, examinations, and the awarding of degrees fall under the purview of the university administration. Buildings would also be maintained by the university regardless of which college owned them. The colleges would be entrusted with small group \\"student-oriented teaching\\". Rationalisation was suggested to reduce duplication of efforts among the different colleges. University Administration Building The federal structure of the university would thus be replaced by something closer to that of a unitary university. This was controversial among the colleges. The Board of Governors of New Asia College flatly rejected the recommendations of the report, alleging that it would destroy the collegiate system, turning the colleges into \\"empty shells\\". Dr. Denny Huang, a longtime member of the Board of Governors of Chung Chi College, criticised the effort to centralise powers and stated that the college governorship would be reduced to \\"nothing more than managers of an estate\\". The Fulton Report recommendations were packaged into the Chinese University of Hong Kong Bill 1976. In defence of the bill the acting Secretary for Social Services, M.C. Morgan, said that \\"a situation with each college developing into a little university of its own was not compatible with the sensible evolution of a modern major seat of higher learning\\". The changes recommended by the report came into effect in December 1976. Ch'ien Mu Library The first non-founding college, Shaw College, was named after its patron, Sir Run Run Shaw, who donated five hundred million Hong Kong dollars toward its establishment in May 1985. The Chinese University of Hong Kong (Declaration of Shaw College) Ordinance was passed by the Legislative Council in July 1986, and the fourth college was officially opened in March 1990 by Run Run Shaw and Governor David Wilson. The 1990s brought about another building boom. The original Chung Chi teaching and administration blocks were demolished and replaced with larger, more modern structures in several phases over the course of a decade. The Ho Sin-Hang engineering block opened in 1994 to house the new School of Engineering. In 1994, the school transitioned to a British-style three-year bachelor's degree system. The Hong Kong Internet Exchange, a metropolitan network backbone, was founded in 1995 and remains an internet hub for the region. In the 2000s, the underwent another period of expansion, in part to accommodate increased student numbers brought about by the 334 Scheme. Five new colleges came into operation: Morningside College and S. H. Ho College were announced in 2006, and were followed in 2007 by C. W. Chu College, Wu Yee Sun College and Lee Woo Sing College. These colleges are smaller in scale than the older ones, each comprising only one or two blocks rather than an entire section of campus and housing fewer students, but they nonetheless each contain the usual array of facilities like student hostels, amenities and communal dining halls. New teaching blocks and a student amenity centre were also opened near the railway station. Goddess of Democracy The Goddess and accompanying relief On 29 May 2010, when the CUHK student union sought to permanently locate a 'Goddess of Democracy' statue on campus, the administrative and planning committee of the university convened an emergency meeting for 1 June, chaired by incumbent Vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau, to consider the request.Siu, Beatrice (8 June 2010) Goddess posed huge \`political risk' to campus , The Standard Retrieved on 8 June 2010. The application was turned down; the reason provided was the need for the university to maintain political neutrality. Staff and students objected to the refusal, however, accusing the committee of self-censorship; students declared they were prepared for a stand-off against the university, saying they would ensure the statues were accommodated on campus \\"at all costs\\".\\"Goddess statue for CUHK campus \`at all costs\\" , The Standard Retrieved on 5 June 2010. A student meeting was convened, and student union President Eric Lai told 2,000 attendees that the university officials should apologise for their opposition of the art display.\\"Students give statue a new home\\". South China Morning Post On 4 June, bowing to public outcry and student pressure, the university relented, and allowed the statue on campus. Students attend an open-air meeting on campus Vice-chancellor designate Joseph Sung, who was consulted on the vote in absentia, admitted that it was the biggest political storm in 21 years. He revealed that, in addition to preserving political neutrality, safety and security concerns were factors in the decision. He also drew a distinction between this application ‚Äì for a permanent University installation ‚Äì and hypothetical applications for short- term expressions of free speech, suggesting the latter would have been more likely to be approved, but he criticised the management team as \\"immature\\" and \\"inexperienced\\" in handling the incident. An editorial in The Standard criticised the committee's naivety in not anticipating the reaction. It was also highly critical of Sung for seeking to distance himself from the decision with such a \\"lame excuse\\".'Mary Ma' (8 June 2010). \\"Sung rides on Goddess storm\\" , The Standard Retrieved on 8 June 2010. Outgoing Vice-chancellor Lawrence Lau defended the committee's decision as \\"collective and unanimous\\" after \\"detailed consideration,\\" citing the unanimous vote of the administrative and planning committee, and he disagreed with Sung's characterisation of the management team.

South China Morning Post. Retrieved on 5 June 2010. 2019 protest conflict Confrontation between protesters and police in No. 2 Bridge of CUHK on 13 November 2019. During the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, the campus became the site of a series of clashes between protesters and the Hong Kong Police Force. On 12 November, the riot police entered the campus and fired 1,567 tear gas rounds, 380 bean bag rounds and 1,312 rubber bullets while protesters built barricades, throwing bricks and petrol bombs. President Rocky Tuan tried to seek mediation with the police, which was rejected. It resulted in a two-day siege of the university by the police from 13 to 15 November. Most protesters left the campus by 15 November. At least 70 students were injured. As a response to increasing police violence on campus, protestors barricaded most entrances and exits, leading to a campus-wide transport disruption. The increasing violence led to the University Senate voting to cancel the ongoing semester, followed by a university-wide evacuation.

Moreover, associate School of Continuing and Professional Studies (CUSCS) offers associate degree and higher diploma programmes. =Funding= In 2005, the university budget was HK$4,558 million, with government subvention of about HK$2,830 million.CUHK Income and Expenditure 2004‚Äì2005 In the 2018‚Äì19 fiscal year (starts 1 April), total income was increased to $9,624 million while government subvention had risen to $5,121 million, about 53.2% of the total budget. Academics =Teaching and learning= CUHK currently adopts a strategic plan in five fields of academic inquiry: Biomedical Sciences, Chinese Studies, Economics & Finance, Geoinformation & Earth Sciences and Information Sciences. Despite the stipulation of using Chinese language as the principal medium in the university's ordinance, CUHK has emphasised the importance of both English and Chinese. However, most classes still adopt English as the main language of instruction. =Research= The Yale-China Chinese Language Centre (CLC), formerly New Asia ‚Äì Yale-in-China Chinese Language Center, was founded in 1963 under the joint auspices of New Asia College and the Yale-China Association. The centre became part of Chinese University in 1974 and has been responsible for the teaching of one language education (Putonghua and Cantonese) of university students as well as other Putonghua and Cantonese learners. Courses are offered for non-native speakers and for native speakers of Chinese. Programmes are divided into Putonghua courses for local students, Cantonese courses for mainland Chinese Students and Putonghua and Cantonese courses for non-native Chinese speakers. The university also hosts several research centres. The Childhood Bilingualism Research Centre (CBRC) is part of the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages. Research at the centre includes documenting the development of bilingualism in bilingual children and assessing the bilingual competence they gain in childhood; raising the public's awareness of Hong Kong children's development of biliteracy and trilingualism; and studying and supporting the revitalisation of minority languages in the context of bilingual and multilingual education. The centre is directed by Professor Virginia Yip and Professor Stephen Matthews.Yip, V. and S. Matthews. 2010.

The Universities Service Centre for China Studies (USC), founded in 1963 as \\"The Universities Service Center,\\" was renamed and moved from Kowloon to the campus in 1988. Its mission is to support the study of contemporary China and Hong Kong, especially among mainland Chinese, Hong Kong, and international scholars. The centre houses a major collection of mainland newspapers, periodicals, and official publications.Universities Center for Chinese Studies The Chinese University of Hong Kong =Libraries and museums= Gate of Wisdom, a 1987 bronze sculpture by Ju Ming, standing outside of the University Library The University Library System (ULS) comprises seven different libraries and several special collections. The largest library is the University Library at the Central Campus, which recently underwent a significant renovation and building expansion. The other six libraries are the Elisabeth Luce Moore Library, Ch‚Äôien Mu Library, Wu Chung Library, Architecture Library, Li Ping Medical Library, and Lee Quo Wei Law Library. Among the collections housed by ULS includes the Hong Kong Studies Archive, Hong Kong Literature Collection, Chinese Overseas Collection, Nobel Laureate GAO, Xingjian Collection, Nobel Laureate CY Yang Archive, American Studies Resource Collection and Modern Chinese Drama Collection. CUHK also houses the Chinese University of Hong Kong Art Museum, which houses \\"a wide range of artefacts illuminating the rich arts, humanities and cultural heritage of ancient and pre-modern China.\\" A new Museum of Climate Change, the first such museum in Hong Kong, opened in December 2013 in the Yasumoto International Academic Park building. Funded by the Hong Kong Jockey Club, the 100 exhibits on display illustrate the effects of climate change. The museum is open to the public free of charge. Also in 2013, the University Gallery opened in the central library to showcase the history of the school in light of its Golden Jubilee anniversary. =Reputation and rankings= CUHK has been consistently regarded as a member of the top three higher learning institutions in the territory by various university rankings. In particular, it has continuously been the top Hong Kong institution in the ARWU, which is based on awards and research output, including those league tables in 2006, 2010, 2011, and 2013. HKU Public Opinion Programme survey (2012) gave it the 2nd place. Besides overall rankings, a list of subject rankings of Hong Kong tertiary institutions is available to show the strength of its individual disciplines ranked by the above organisations. The university came 118th in the world by US News & Report. China's Alumni Association placed it among the \\"6-Star Greater China's Universities\\" (the highest level) and it was ranked fourth in the Association's 2014 Ranking of Institutions with the Most Best Disciplines in HK, Macau and Taiwan. CUHK received eight Higher Education Outstanding Scientific Research Output Awards (Science and Technology) from the Ministry of Education (MoE) in 2014, including two first-class awards and five second- class awards in Natural Sciences, making it the institution receiving the highest number of awards in the local tertiary sector. CUHK was ranked as world's #49 in 2019 in QS ranking. CUHK business school was ranked 17th in the Financial Times EMBA rankings, and its MBA programme was placed 27th worldwide in the Global MBA Rankings (2013) and 94th in the Economist's 2012 ranking. Despite a short history of 36 years as of 2017, CUHK's medical school was ranked as world's #49 in 2014 and #47 in 2016 in QS ranking. It has built abundant specialty research centres and hailed constant research innovations by its faculty. The medical school curriculum also places a heavy emphasis on bioethics and humanity in medicine and has built this course track in collaboration with Columbia University. CUHK is expecting its first and only private hospital to finish construction in 2021. The hospital's philanthropic mission is to provide affordable and quality health care to serve local Hong Kong citizens and it will help admit and treat public hospital patients to ease the burden of overflow beginning in its 5th year of operation. Student life =School environment= CUHK possesses the largest campus of all higher education institutions in Hong Kong. The hilly 137.3-hectare campus hosts a range of facilities essential for an all-round campus experience, such as libraries, art museums, music halls, a swimming pool, sports fields, tennis courts, squash courts, a water sports centre and gymnasiums. Many points around the campus offer attractive views of Tide Cove and the Tolo Harbour. The university has two full-size sports grounds with running tracks: the Sir Philip Haddon-Cave Sports Field and the Lingnan Stadium. The Olympic-size swimming pool at the Benjamin Franklin Centre was completed in 1973, with an opening ceremony held in October 1974 hosted by Charles T. Cross. The university Water Sports Centre, on the shore of Tide Cove, offers facilities and equipment hire for sailing, rowing, and windsurfing. Most of CUHK is in Sha Tin District although small parts are in Tai Po District.\\"Campus Map.\\" Chinese University of Hong Kong. Retrieved on 12 May 2019. =Collegiate system= As a collegiate university, the school comprises nine colleges that differ in character and history, each retaining substantial autonomy on institutional affairs: Chung Chi College, New Asia College, United College, Shaw College, Morningside College, S. H. Ho College, Lee Woo Sing College, Wu Yee Sun College and C. W. Chu College. All undergraduates are affiliated to one of them.CUHK College system framelessUnited College (above) and Chung Chi Tong student centre (below). Colleges are designed as communities with their own hostels, dining halls and other facilities. Students receive pastoral care and whole-person education, including formal and non-formal general education by means of close interaction with teachers and peers, and in some colleges, assemblies and college final year project. Colleges promote extracurricular social and athletic activities with an aim of building camaraderie among students. This focus on 'student orientated teaching', education through both formal teaching and student empowerment, distinguishes CUHK from other universities in the territory. When the structure of the university was revamped in 1976, and the autonomy of the colleges diminished, Lord Fulton clarified the role of the colleges: \\"the natural home of student-oriented teaching is the college [which] is an association of senior and junior members come together in pursuit of shared academic interests and aims.\\" He wrote that the colleges help students achieve \\"a sense of his or her personal significance and responsibility, and on that basis to enrich the common life.\\" =Transportation= CUHK shuttle bus Although the campus is located away from the busier districts of Hong Kong, access to the school is easy. The university is served by University Station of the Mass Transit Railway (MTR) as well as the Hong Kong bus system. Bus and railway stations are located beside Chung Chi College, with additional bus stops just outside the two school entrances on Tai Po Road. To cope with new students from the 3-3-4 education system, the new exit D of University Station opened in September 2012. A system of shuttle bus routes, operated by the university's Transport Office, runs between the MTR station, academic buildings, and residences. Shuttle buses are free for students and staff. There are paid shuttle light bus operating from Monday to Saturday as well. The topography of the campus, as well a layout confusing to newcomers, may deter many from walking around campus. Many buildings on campus incorporate lifts and bridges designed to provide shortcuts in ascending the hill. The latest campus master plan has recognized this strategy as desirable and proposes the development of new walking routes to reduce reliance on the campus bus system. Notable people As of 2013, four Nobel Prize winners are associated with the university, including Chen Ning Yang, James Mirrlees, Robert Alexander Mundell and former university president Charles K. Kao. Other notable faculty members include mathematician Shing-Tung Yau, laureate of the Fields Medal and the Veblen Prize, and computational theorist Andrew Yao, laureate of the Turing Award, and surgeon James Ware.Distinguished Faculty Members .

The company continues to be run by founder Sam Boyd's family under the management of Sam's son, Bill Boyd (born 1931), who currently serves as the company's executive chairman after retiring as CEO in January 2008. As of December 31, 2009, the 15 wholly owned properties had 7,550 hotel rooms. It also had of casino space with 21,400 slot machines and 425 table games. Gaming revenue is 75% of total gross revenue. History Boyd Gaming's history dates to 1941, when founder Sam Boyd first arrived in Las Vegas with his family. After being hired as a dealer, Sam Boyd worked his way up through the ranks of the Las Vegas casino industry, first to pit boss, then shift boss. He eventually saved enough to buy a small interest in the Sahara Hotel and Casino; later, Sam Boyd left the Sahara to become general manager and partner of The Mint Las Vegas. Sam Boyd first partnered with his son Bill in 1962, when the two teamed up to acquire the Eldorado Casino in Henderson, Nevada. Bill, who was then a practicing attorney, acquired his first stake in the Eldorado by doing its legal work. Sam would go on to manage the Eldorado full- time after the Mint was sold in 1968. unincorporated Spring Valley, a Las Vegas suburb Boyd Gaming's Executive headquarters at Howard Hughes Center Although the Boyd family had been involved in the Las Vegas casino industry for decades, Boyd Gaming Corporation wasn't founded until January 1, 1975, when the company was formed to develop and operate the California Hotel and Casino in downtown Las Vegas. Then known as the Boyd Group, the company initially had 75 investors. Boyd Gaming embarked on its first expansion in 1979, when it opened Sam's Town Hotel and Gambling Hall on Boulder Highway at Nellis Boulevard. Considered one of the first \\"locals\\" properties in Las Vegas, Sam's Town helped inaugurate the later development of Las Vegas' \\"Boulder Strip.\\" During these first two decades in operation, Sam and Bill Boyd developed a reputation for running a squeaky-clean operation. As a result, Nevada regulators turned to the Boyds for help following an investigation of skimming operations at the Stardust and Fremont casinos in the mid-1980s. The properties were notorious at the time for their extensive skimming operations; according to the FBI, anywhere from $7 million to $15 million in funds from the Stardust were diverted to organized crime figures between 1974 and 1976 alone. In 1984, after leveling a $3 million fine against the Stardust for skimming, the Nevada Gaming Commission asked to Boyds to run the property's gaming operations. When the Stardust was taken over by the reputable Boyd family, they were surprised by its huge profits, now that every penny of income was being recorded. Ex-FBI agent William F. Roemer Jr., longtime senior agent of the FBI's organized-crime squad in Chicago and an expert in Las Vegas doings, said, \\"The amount of skim had been so heavy that the profit and loss statement did not present a true picture of the gold mine that the Stardust was.\\" After several years of successful operations, Boyd Gaming officially acquired the Stardust and Fremont in 1985. Company founder Sam Boyd died on January 15, 1993, at the age of 82, and was succeeded as Chief Executive Officer by Bill Boyd. In July of the same year, Boyd Gaming held its initial public offering of stock, debuting on the New York Stock Exchange under ticker symbol \\"BYD.\\" Funds from the IPO supplied Boyd Gaming with a source of capital for expansion, and the company embarked on a period of aggressive growth. The company acquired the Eldorado and Jokers Wild (which had previously been owned directly by the Boyd family) in 1993; later that year, Boyd Gaming acquired the bankrupt Main Street Station Hotel and Casino and Brewery. The company's first expansion outside of Nevada came in 1994, when Boyd Gaming opened Sam's Town in Tunica, Miss. Later expansions included: * Silver Star Hotel and Casino, owned by the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians (opened in 1994; management contract expired in 2000); * Treasure Chest Casino in Kenner, Louisiana (Boyd owned 15% of the property at its 1994 opening, before acquiring Treasure Chest outright in 1997); * Sam's Town Kansas City (opened 1995, closed 1998); * Par-A-Dice Hotel and Casino in East Peoria, Illinois. (acquired in 1996); * Blue Chip Casino, Hotel and Spa in Michigan City, Indiana. (acquired in 1999); * Delta Downs Racetrack Casino & Hotel, Vinton, Louisiana (acquired in 2001); * Sam's Town Shreveport (formerly Harrah's Shreveport; acquired from Harrah's Entertainment in 2004). Boyd Gaming's most ambitious expansion project came in 2003, when the company opened the $1.1 billion Borgata Hotel Casino in Atlantic City, N.J. A joint venture with MGM Resorts International, Borgata was the first new casino property to open in Atlantic City in 13 years, and quickly emerged as the market's leading property by gaming revenue. Borgata is by far Boyd Gaming's largest property, and currently supplies more than a third of the company's overall profits. Less than a year after Borgata opened, Boyd Gaming announced plans to acquire Coast Casinos, Inc., one of the largest operators of locals casinos in the Las Vegas market. Completed on July 1, 2004, the $1.3 billion acquisition gave Boyd Gaming four additional Las Vegas properties‚ÄîSuncoast; Gold Coast; the Orleans; and Barbary Coast. The Coast acquisition also included the yet-to-be completed South Coast, located five miles (8 km) south of the Strip on Las Vegas Boulevard. Boyd Gaming completed the project and opened its doors on December 22, 2005. Boyd Gaming operated the property for less than a year before selling it to former Coast CEO Michael Gaughan in 2006. (The property was rebranded to its current name, South Point, following the sale to Gaughan.) In 2006, Boyd Gaming turned its focus to what would have been the largest project in its history: Echelon, a $4.8 billion resort complex at the site of the Stardust. In preparation for the project, Boyd Gaming swapped the Barbary Coast to Harrah's Entertainment in exchange for 24 acres near the Stardust, giving the company an 87-acre parcel on the north end of the Strip. The famed Stardust was closed on November 1, 2006, and imploded the night of March 13, 2007. Construction on Echelon Place began on June 19, 2007 with plans to open in 2010, but was suspended a little over one year later, on August 1, 2008. At the time, Boyd Gaming officials cited \\"the difficult environment in today's capital markets, as well as weak economic conditions,\\" and estimated construction would resume in three to four quarters. As the global recession deepened, the suspension continued; in October 2009, the company said it would likely be three to five years before development resumed. However, in March 2013, Boyd sold the Echelon site for $350 million to the Genting Group, a Malaysia-based gaming company to develop the site as Resorts World Las Vegas. In 2007, Boyd purchased Dania Jai Alai, a fronton in Dania Beach, Florida. The company hoped to expand the facility with a casino, but efforts to allow new casinos in the Miami area made little headway. Boyd agreed in 2011 to sell the property to Dania Entertainment for $80 million, but the deal was not completed. The two companies reached a new sale agreement in February 2013 for $65.5 million. Boyd Gaming bought the IP Casino Resort & Spa in October 2011 for $278 million cash, plus a $10 million donation to the Engelstad Family Foundation. In November 2012, Boyd acquired Peninsula Gaming, an Iowa-based company with five casinos in the Midwest and South, for $1.45 billion. The company made two deals in 2016 to expand its footprint in the Vegas locals market, acquiring the Aliante Casino and Hotel for $380 million and the two properties of Cannery Casino Resorts for $230 million. Meanwhile, it sold its 50 percent stake in the Borgata to MGM for $900 million. In July 2018, Boyd announced a partnership with MGM Resorts International \\"to significantly increase each company's market access and customer base throughout the United States.\\" The partnership is focused on positioning both companies to succeed in the emerging online gambling and sports betting markets in the United States. In late 2018, Boyd completed two deals to increase its regional holdings. It acquired Valley Forge Casino Resort in Pennsylvania for $281 million. It also purchased the operations of four casinos from Pinnacle Entertainment for $564 million: Ameristar Kansas City, Ameristar St. Charles, Belterra Casino, and Belterra Park. The company paid another $58 million for the real estate of Belterra Park. The sale was designed to ensure regulatory approval for Penn National Gaming's planned purchase of Pinnacle. On July 13, 2020, Boyd Gaming announced it was laying off at least 25% of its workforce equating to thousands of job losses at its properties nationwide due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States.

For example, a scaling technique might involve estimating individuals' levels of extraversion, or the perceived quality of products. Certain methods of scaling permit estimation of magnitudes on a continuum, while other methods provide only for relative ordering of the entities. The level of measurement is the type of data that is poopmeasured. The word scale is sometimes (including in academic literature) used to refer to another composite measure, that of an index. Those concepts are however different. Scale construction decisions *What level (level of measurement) of data is involved (nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio)? *What will the results be used for? *Should you use a scale, index, or typology? *What types of statistical analysis would be useful? *Should you use a comparative scale or a noncomparative scale? *How many scale divisions or categories should be used (1 to 10; 1 to 7; ‚àí3 to +3)? *Should there be an odd or even number of divisions? (Odd gives neutral center value; even forces respondents to take a non-neutral position.) *What should the nature and descriptiveness of the scale labels be? *What should the physical form or layout of the scale be? (graphic, simple linear, vertical, horizontal) *Should a response be forced or be left optional? Scale construction method It is possible that something similar to your scale will already exist, so including those scale(s) and possible dependent variables in your survey may increase validity of your scale. #Begin by generating at least ten items to represent each of the scales. Administer the survey; the more representative and larger your sample, the more confidence you will have in your scales. #Review the means and standard deviations for your items, dropping any items with skewed means or very low variance. #Run a principal components analysis with oblique rotation on your items and the other items for scales it will be important to differentiate from your own. Request components with eigenvalues (for calculating eigenvalue for each factor square the factor loading's and sum down the columns) greater than 1. It is easier if you group the items by targeted scales. The more distinct the other items, the better your chances your items will load only on your own scale. #‚ÄúCleanly loaded items‚Äù are those that load at least .40 on one component and more than .10 greater on that component than on any others. Identify those. #‚ÄúCross loaded items‚Äù are those that do not meet the above criterion. These are candidates to drop. #Identify components with only a few items that do not represent clear concepts, these are ‚Äúuninterpretable scales.‚Äù Also identify any components with only one item. These components and their items are candidates to drop. #Look at the candidates to drop and the components to be dropped. Is there anything that needs to be retained because it is critical to your construct ? For example, if a conceptually important item only cross loads on a component to be dropped, it is good to keep it for the next round. #Drop the items, and rerun asking the program to give you only the number of components after dropping the uninterpretable and single-item ones. Go through the process again starting at Step 3. #Keep running through the process until you get ‚Äúclean factors‚Äù (all components have cleanly loaded items). #Run the Alpha program (asking for the Alphas if each item is dropped). Any scales with insufficient Alphas should be dropped and the process repeated from Step 3. [Coefficient alpha=number of items2 x average correlation between different items/sum of all correlations in the correlation matrix (including 1s)] #For better practices, keep the final components and all loadings of yours and similar scales selected to be used in the Appendix of your scale. Data types The type of information collected can influence scale construction. Different types of information are measured in different ways. #Some data are measured at the nominal level. That is, any numbers used are mere labels; they express no mathematical properties. Examples are SKU inventory codes and UPC bar codes. #Some data are measured at the ordinal level. Numbers indicate the relative position of items, but not the magnitude of difference. An example is a preference ranking. #Some data are measured at the interval level. Numbers indicate the magnitude of difference between items, but there is no absolute zero point. Examples are attitude scales and opinion scales. #Some data are measured at the ratio level. Numbers indicate magnitude of difference and there is a fixed zero point. Ratios can be calculated. Examples include: age, income, price, costs, sales revenue, sales volume, and market share. Composite measures Composite measures of variables are created by combining two or more separate empirical indicators into a single measure. Composite measures measure complex concepts more adequately than single indicators, extend the range of scores available and are more efficient at handling multiple items. In addition to scales, there are two other types of composite measures. Indexes are similar to scales except multiple indicators of a variable are combined into a single measure. The index of consumer confidence, for example, is a combination of several measures of consumer attitudes. A typology is similar to an index except the variable is measured at the nominal level. Indexes are constructed by accumulating scores assigned to individual attributes, while scales are constructed through the assignment of scores to patterns of attributes. While indexes and scales provide measures of a single dimension, typologies are often employed to examine the intersection of two or more dimensions. Typologies are very useful analytical tools and can be easily used as independent variables, although since they are not unidimensional it is difficult to use them as a dependent variable.  Comparative and non comparative scaling  With comparative scaling, the items are directly compared with each other (example: Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke?). In noncomparative scaling each item is scaled independently of the others (example: How do you feel about Coke?). Comparative scaling techniques *Pairwise comparison scale ‚Äì a respondent is presented with two items at a time and asked to select one (example : Do you prefer Pepsi or Coke?). This is an ordinal level technique when a measurement model is not applied. Krus and Kennedy (1977) elaborated the paired comparison scaling within their domain- referenced model. The Bradley‚ÄìTerry‚ÄìLuce (BTL) model (Bradley and Terry, 1952; Luce, 1959) can be applied in order to derive measurements provided the data derived from paired comparisons possess an appropriate structure. Thurstone's Law of comparative judgment can also be applied in such contexts. *Rasch model scaling ‚Äì respondents interact with items and comparisons are inferred between items from the responses to obtain scale values. Respondents are subsequently also scaled based on their responses to items given the item scale values. The Rasch model has a close relation to the BTL model. *Rank-ordering ‚Äì a respondent is presented with several items simultaneously and asked to rank them (example : Rate the following advertisements from 1 to 10.). This is an ordinal level technique. *Bogardus social distance scale ‚Äì measures the degree to which a person is willing to associate with a class or type of people. It asks how willing the respondent is to make various associations. The results are reduced to a single score on a scale. There are also non-comparative versions of this scale. *Q-Sort ‚Äì Up to 140 items are sorted into groups based on rank-order procedure. *Guttman scale ‚Äì This is a procedure to determine whether a set of items can be rank-ordered on a unidimensional scale. It utilizes the intensity structure among several indicators of a given variable. Statements are listed in order of importance. The rating is scaled by summing all responses until the first negative response in the list. The Guttman scale is related to Rasch measurement; specifically, Rasch models bring the Guttman approach within a probabilistic framework. *Constant sum scale ‚Äì a respondent is given a constant sum of money, script, credits, or points and asked to allocate these to various items (example : If you had 100 Yen to spend on food products, how much would you spend on product A, on product B, on product C, etc.). This is an ordinal level technique. *Magnitude estimation scale ‚Äì In a psychophysics procedure invented by S. S. Stevens people simply assign numbers to the dimension of judgment. The geometric mean of those numbers usually produces a power law with a characteristic exponent. In cross-modality matching instead of assigning numbers, people manipulate another dimension, such as loudness or brightness to match the items. Typically the exponent of the psychometric function can be predicted from the magnitude estimation exponents of each dimension. Non-comparative scaling techniques *Visual analogue scale (also called the Continuous rating scale and the graphic rating scale) ‚Äì respondents rate items by placing a mark on a line. The line is usually labeled at each end. There are sometimes a series of numbers, called scale points, (say, from zero to 100) under the line. Scoring and codification is difficult for paper-and-pencil scales, but not for computerized and Internet-based visual analogue scales.U.-D. Reips and F. Funke (2008) \\"Interval level measurement with visual analogue scales in Internet-based research: VAS Generator.\\" *Likert scale ‚Äì Respondents are asked to indicate the amount of agreement or disagreement (from strongly agree to strongly disagree) on a five- to nine-point response scale (not to be confused with a Likert scale). The same format is used for multiple questions. It is the combination of these questions that forms the Likert scale. This categorical scaling procedure can easily be extended to a magnitude estimation procedure that uses the full scale of numbers rather than verbal categories. *Phrase completion scales ‚Äì Respondents are asked to complete a phrase on an 11-point response scale in which 0 represents the absence of the theoretical construct and 10 represents the theorized maximum amount of the construct being measured. The same basic format is used for multiple questions. *Semantic differential scale ‚Äì Respondents are asked to rate on a 7-point scale an item on various attributes. Each attribute requires a scale with bipolar terminal labels. *Stapel scale ‚Äì This is a unipolar ten-point rating scale. It ranges from +5 to ‚àí5 and has no neutral zero point. *Thurstone scale ‚Äì This is a scaling technique that incorporates the intensity structure among indicators. *Mathematically derived scale ‚Äì Researchers infer respondents‚Äô evaluations mathematically. Two examples are multi dimensional scaling and conjoint analysis. Scale evaluation Scales should be tested for reliability, generalizability, and validity. Generalizability is the ability to make inferences from a sample to the population, given the scale you have selected. Reliability is the extent to which a scale will produce consistent results. Test-retest reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated under similar circumstances. Alternative forms reliability checks how similar the results are if the research is repeated using different forms of the scale. Internal consistency reliability checks how well the individual measures included in the scale are converted into a composite measure. Scales and indexes have to be validated. Internal validation checks the relation between the individual measures included in the scale, and the composite scale itself. External validation checks the relation between the composite scale and other indicators of the variable, indicators not included in the scale. Content validation (also called face validity) checks how well the scale measures what is supposed to measured. Criterion validation checks how meaningful the scale criteria are relative to other possible criteria. Construct validation checks what underlying construct is being measured. There are three variants of construct validity. They are convergent validity, discriminant validity, and nomological validity (Campbell and Fiske, 1959; Krus and Ney, 1978). The coefficient of reproducibility indicates how well the data from the individual measures included in the scale can be reconstructed from the composite scale.

He was also a private detective prior to working as a boxing trainer. In 1919, Ingber was invited by millionaires Alpheus Geer and Hiram Mallison to manage Stillman's Gym. When Ingber came along, the gym was actually named the Marshall Stillman Athletic Club. In the late 1920s, the gym changed its name. Patrons used to think Ingber's last name was Stillman; because of this, they greeted him as Mr. Stillman. Stillman, described as moody and acid-tonged, among other things, by boxing historians and writers, disliked having to correct everyone who called him Mr. Stillman, so eventually he changed his name legally from Louis Ingber to Lou Stillman. Stillman was famous for keeping his gym as unsanitary as possible: He allowed the public to smoke in a closed-windows atmosphere, and he let the gym floors to go uncleaned, sometimes for years. He said: \\"The golden age of prizefighting was the age of bad food, bad air, bad sanitation, and no sunlight. I keep the place like this for the fighters' own good. If I clean it up they'll catch a cold from the cleanliness\\". Stillman carried a gun around his waist when he was at the gym. He had two guards watching the doors, to make sure everyone paid the 25 cents price to get in and watch the boxers practice. He had a sign that read: \\"Anyone caught stealing will be barred for life\\". When French dancer Jeanne Lamar showed up at Stillman's to train in 1922, Stillman told her that there were \\"no facilities for girls\\" in his gym, but she stood around and used the gym to get in shape anyway. Many famous people trained there, mainly boxers: Jack Dempsey, Georges Carpentier, Primo Carnera, Fred Apostoli, Joe Louis and Rocky Marciano were some of the famous world champions who trained at Stillman's Gym. One who refused to train there was Gene Tunney, because he complained about the place's sanitation, saying that he would never train there unless the windows were opened. Typical of him, Stillman refused to open the windows. Stillman retired in 1959 after selling the building, and he joined his daughter in California. He liked painting, and became proficient painting in oils as he spent the last few years of his life at a nursing home in Santa Barbara. He died on August 19, 1969. In popular culture Stillman's Gym was featured in several motion pictures, including the Rocky Graziano biographical film Somebody Up There Likes Me (1956) and It's Always Fair Weather (1955), which has a musical number set in the gym, \\"Baby You Knock Me Out,\\" featuring Cyd Charisse.

( is used in the Hebrew Bible to indicate \\"rage, fierceness, insolence, pride\\") Rahab is the emblematic name of Egypt and is also used for the sea. In medieval Jewish folklore, Rahab is a mythical sea-monster.  Biblical usage  = Egypt = Rahab is a poetical name for Egypt. It might have Egyptian origins that were accommodated to the Hebrew language. However, there is nothing revealing in the Coptic language. > I mention Rahab (Egypt) and Babel to those knowing Me, Lo, Philistia, and > Tyre, with Cush! This [one] was born there. (Psalm )YLT > Thou [Jehovah] art ruler over the pride of the sea, In the lifting up of its > billows, Thou dost restrain them. Thou hast bruised Rahab (Egypt), as one > wounded. With the arm of Thy strength, Thou hast scattered Thine enemies. > ()YLT > Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of Jehovah, Awake, as [in] days of old, > generations of the ages, Art not Thou it that is hewing down Rahab (Egypt), > Piercing a dragon! ()YLT = Creation narratives in Biblical texts = Before the Medieval adoption of \\"Rahab\\" to mean demon or sea-beast, the name also appears in Psalm 89: 5-12 and Isaiah 51:9-10. Rahab, in these passages, takes the meaning of primeval, chaotic, multi-headed sea-dragon or Leviathan. It is often assumed that long before the Jewish mythos, the ancient Jews emulated the creation fables told by their predecessors. The Babylonians, for example, told of a sky-god, Marduk, and a sea-goddess, Tiamat, battling for supreme power over the other gods, in the En√ªma Eli≈°. It can be speculated these two characters in the Babylonian myth are parallel to the creation stories found in the Biblical passages containing the name Rahab.Coogan, Michael D. (2014). The Old Testament: A Historical and Literary Introduction to Hebrew Scriptures. New York: Oxford University Press. pp. 34‚Äì40. .  Rahab as insolence or pride  In Isaiah 30:7, raha·∏á (insolence, strength) becomes a proverbial expression that gives an allusion to the Hebrew etymology insolence. > Yea, Egyptians [are] vanity, and in vain do help, Therefore, I have cried > concerning this: \`Their strength (raha·∏á) [is] to sit still. ()YLT In the Book of Job, raha·∏á (pride, blusterer) occurs in the Hebrew text and is translated in the King James Version as \\"proud\\". > [If] God will not withdraw his anger, the proud (raha·∏á) helpers do stoop > under him. ()KJV > He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding he smiteth > through the proud (raha·∏á). ()KJV  Jewish folklore  In medieval Jewish folklore, Rahab (splendour) is a mythical sea monster, a dragon of the waters, the \\"demonic angel of the sea\\". Rahab is also seen as a deity in the text. Rahab represents the primordial abyss, the water-dragon of darkness and chaos, comparable to Leviathan and Tiamat. Rahab later became a particular demon, inhabitant of the sea, especially associated with the Red Sea..

The term was not in use during the Roman period (when Wales had not come into existence as a distinct entity). It emerged later, in the medieval period, after the Anglo-Saxon settlement of much of Britain led to a territorial distinction between the new Anglo-Saxon kingdoms (which would become England and Southern Scotland) and the remaining Celtic British kingdoms (which would become Wales). Latin being the primary language of scholarship in Western Christendom, writers needed a term to refer to the Celtic British territory and coined Cambria based on the Welsh name for it. Etymology The Welsh word Cymru (Wales), along with Cymry (Welsh people), was falsely supposed by 17th-century celticists to be connected to the Biblical Gomer, or to the Cimbri or the Cimmerians of Antiquity. In reality it is descended from the Brittonic word combrogi, meaning \\"fellow-countrymen\\". The term thus conveys something like \\"[land of] fellow-countrymen\\". The use of Cymry as a self-designation seems to have arisen in the post-Roman Era, to refer collectively to the Brythonic peoples of Britain, inhabiting what are now Wales, Cornwall, Northern England, and Southern Scotland. It came into use as a self-description probably before the 7th century and is attested in a praise poem to Cadwallon ap Cadfan (Moliant Cadwallon, by Afan Ferddig) .Davies (1994) p. 71, The poem contains the line: 'Ar wynep Kymry Cadwallawn was'. In Welsh literature, the word Cymry was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe the Welsh, though the older, more generic term Brythoniaid continued to be used to describe any of the Britonnic peoples (including the Welsh) and was the more common literary term until c. 1100. Thereafter Cymry prevailed as a reference to the Welsh. Until c. 1560 the word was spelt Kymry or Cymry, regardless of whether it referred to the people or the country.Davies (1994) p. 69 The Latinised form Cambria was coined in the Middle Ages, and was used regularly by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Cambria in legend According to Geoffrey of Monmouth in the first part of his pseudohistory Historia Regum Britanniae (\\"History of the Kings of Britain\\"), the Trojan Brutus had three sons, among whom he divided his lands after landing in Britain and subduing Gogmagog. His eldest son, Locrinus, received the land between the rivers Humber and Severn, which he called Loegria (a Latinisation of the medieval Welsh name Lloegyr (modern Welsh: Lloegr), \\"England\\"). His second son, Albanactus, got the lands beyond the Humber, which took from him the name of Albany (Yr Alban in Welsh: Scotland). The youngest son, Camber, was bequeathed everything beyond the Severn, which was called after him \\"Cambria\\". This legend was widely prevalent throughout the 12th‚Äì16th centuries. Legacy The name ‚ÄúCambria‚Äù lives on in some local names, e.g. Cambrian Line, Cambrian Way. It is also used internationally in geology to denote the geologic period between around 542 million years and 488.3 million years ago; in 1835 the geologist Adam Sedgwick named this geological period the Cambrian, after studying rocks of that age in Wales. It is also a rare female name. It is also found in the name of a number of colleges stretching across North East Wales ‚Äì Coleg Cambria. It is also referenced in the well- known song ‚ÄúMen of Harlech‚Äú, which regales an event of exceptional endurance and valor in 15th century Wales. This song is popular with supporters of Cardiff City Football Club, and also the Welsh National Team. Once the name used for most of upland Wales, the term Cambrian Mountains is now more localised and includes the area from Pumlumon down to Mynydd Mallaen. Cambria is the name of a font in Microsoft Windows.

Tannin (; tannƒ´nƒÅ plural: tannƒ´nƒì; ') or Tunnanu (Ugaritic: êéöêéêêéê tnn, vocalized tu-un-na-nu) was a sea monster in Canaanite and Hebrew mythology used as a symbol of chaos and evil. Canaanite mythology Tannin appears in the Baal Cycle as one of the servants of Yam () defeated by Ba øal () or bound by his sister,  øAnat. He is usually depicted as serpentine, possibly with a double tail. Hebrew mythology The tanninim () also appear in the Hebrew Bible's Book of Genesis,. Exodus,. Deuteronomy,. Psalms, Job,. Ezekiel, & . Isaiah, & . and Jeremiah.. They are explicitly listed among the creatures created by God on the fifth day of the Genesis creation narrative, translated in the King James Version as \\"great whales\\". (KJV). The tannin is listed in the apocalypse of Isaiah as among the sea beasts to be slain by Yahweh \\"on that day\\",. translated in the King James Version as \\"the dragon\\". (KJV). In Jewish mythology, Tannin is sometimes conflated with the related sea monsters Leviathan and Rahab. Along with Rahab, \\"Tannin\\" was a name applied to ancient Egypt after the Exodus to Canaan. The word Tannin is used in the Hebrew Bible fourteen times. Aaron's staff becomes Tannin in the Book of Exodus (Ex 7:9-12), it is used in the meaning \\"snake\\" in the Book of Deuteronomy (Deut 32:33) and Psalms (Ps 91:13). It represents Nebuchadnezzar I (the king of Babylon) in Jeremiah (Jer 51:34) and Pharaoh in Ezekiel (Ezek 29:3, 32:2). In the Book of Job (Job 7:12) the protagonist questions God \\"Am I the sea or the sea dragon that you have set a guard over me?\\" In modern scholarship, Tannin is sometimes associated with Tiamat. The name has subsequently been given to three submarines in the Israeli Navy: the first, an S-class submarine formerly known as HMS Springer, was in commission from 1958 until 1972. The second, a Gal-class submarine, was in commission from 1977 until 2002. The third INS Tanin is a Dolphin-class submarine in commission since 2014.

The dish is popular throughout the Chinese diaspora and appears on the menus of most Chinese restaurants abroad. It is particularly popular in India, Nepal, the UK, and the US. Etymology The words chow mein mean 'stir-fried noodles', also loosely translating to \\"fried noodle\\" in English, chow meaning 'stir-fried' (or \\"saut√©ed\\") and mein meaning 'noodles'. The pronunciation chow mein is an English corruption of the Toishanese pronunciation chƒÅu-m√®n. The Toishan dialect was spoken by migrants to North America from Toishan. Regional cuisine =American Chinese cuisine= Chicken cube chow mein Subgum chow mein Soy sauce chow mein In American Chinese cuisine, it is a stir-fried dish consisting of noodles, meat (chicken being most common but pork, beef, shrimp or tofu sometimes being substituted), onions and celery. It is often served as a specific dish at westernized Chinese restaurants. Vegetarian or vegan chow mein is also common. There are two main kinds of chow mein available on the market: # Steamed chow mein, and # Crispy chow mein, also known as Hong Kong-style chow mein (see below). The steamed chow mein has a softer texture, while the latter is crisper and drier. Crispy chow mein uses fried, flat noodles, while soft chow mein uses long, rounded noodles. Crispy chow mein either has onions and celery in the finished dish or is served \\"strained\\", without any vegetables. Steamed chow mein can have many different kinds of vegetables in the finished dish, most commonly including onions and celery but sometimes carrots, cabbage and mung bean sprouts as well. Crispy chow mein is usually topped with a thick brown sauce, while steamed chow mein is mixed with soy sauce before being served. There is a regional difference in the US between the East and West Coast use of the term \\"chow mein\\". On the East Coast, \\"chow mein\\" is always the crispy or \\"Hong Kong style\\". At some restaurants located in those areas, the crispy chow mein noodles are sometimes deep fried and could be crispy \\"like the ones in cans\\" or \\"fried as crisp as hash browns\\". At a few East Coast locations, \\"chow mein\\" is also served over rice. There, the steamed style using soft noodles is a separate dish called \\"lo mein\\". On the West Coast, \\"chow mein\\" is always the steamed style; the crispy style is simply called \\"Hong Kong style\\" and the term \\"lo mein\\" is not widely used. The crispy version of chow mein can also be served in a hamburger-style bun as a chow mein sandwich. There are also variations on how either one of the two main types of chow mein can be prepared as a dish. When ordering \\"chow mein\\" in some restaurants in Chicago, a diner might receive \\"chop suey poured over crunchy fried noodles\\". In Philadelphia, Americanized chow mein tends to be similar to chop suey but has crispy fried noodles on the side and includes much celery and bean sprouts and is sometimes accompanied with fried rice. Jeremy Iggers of the Star Tribune describes \\"Minnesota-style chow mein\\" as \\"a green slurry of celery and ground pork topped with ribbons of gray processed chicken\\". Bay Area journalist William Wong made a similar comment about what is sold as chow mein in places like Minnesota. Note: The essay in this book was original published in the July 21, 1988 issue of the East-West News as an article titled \\"Minnesota Chow Mein\\". A published recipe for Minnesota-style chow mein includes generous portions of celery and bean sprouts. Another Minnesotan variant includes ground beef and cream of mushroom soup. Food historians and cultural anthropologists have noted that chow mein and other dishes served in Chinese American restaurants located away from areas without any significant Asian American population tend to be very different from what is served in China and are heavily modified to fit the taste preference of the local dominant population. As an example, the chow mein gravy favored in the Fall River area more closely resembles that used in local New England cooking than that used in traditional Chinese cooking. The founder of the food manufacturer Chun King and the creator of canned chow mein admits of using Italian spices to make his product more acceptable to Americans whose ancestors came from Europe. Chow mein is mentioned as early as 1920, in the novel Main Street by Sinclair Lewis. It is frequently confused with chop suey; a dish incorrectly labeled as chow mein was sometimes served in American restaurants, drug store soda fountains, school cafeterias, senior citizens facilities, and military bases chow halls. In many of these cases, this particular dish was served over rice and did not include noodles. In 1946, one of the first companies to market \\"chow mein\\" in a can was Chun King. The product's creator was Jeno Paulucci, the son of Italian immigrants, who developed a recipe based mostly upon Italian spices that would be better catered to the food preferences of European immigrants and some Americans of similar ethnic origins. To keep cost down, Paulucci replaced expensive water chestnuts with lower-cost celery stalks that were originally destined for cattle feed. Paulucci's company became so successful selling canned chow mein and chop suey that President Gerald Ford quipped, \\"What could be more American than a business built on a good Italian recipe for chop suey?\\" when praising Paulucci accomplishments with Chun King. After Paulucci sold Chun King in 1966, the company would be sold several more times more until it was dissolved in 1995. By 1960, Paulucci described in The New York Times that \\"At Chun King we have turned out a 'stew-type' chow mein. I'd guess this type has been around for thirty - maybe forty - years. To make it, all the meat, seasonings and vegetables are dumped into a kettle and stewed for hours - until everything is cooked.\\" Alternate Link via ProQuest. At the time of the interview, \\"sales from restaurants 'to take home' are almost three times as great as in the food markets\\". Paulucci wanted to increase market share by using more effective advertising. =Australian Chinese cuisine= Traditional chow mein is made with egg noodles which are boiled then strained and left to dry. They are then stir fried and finally left to sit at the bottom of the wok and pressed down, this crisps the noodles at the edges and underside. Chow mein is made with either seafood, often just prawns, chicken, beef or barbecued pork. Restaurants will serve a combination chow mein or a single type. Chicken and beef are often softened with a little bicarbonate of soda. The sauce is made from garlic, rice wine, light stock, MSG, salt and corn flour. Vegetables are usually one green such as bok choy or choy sum plus a little chopped carrot, but also other green vegetables are acceptable. This stir fry is poured onto the noodles. Chow mein is unique as its noodles are both soft in part but also crispy. =Brazilian Japanese cuisine= Chow mein was brought to Brazil by Japanese immigrants and is thus referred to as yakisoba ( or ). It fits Brazilian tastes rather than Japanese ones though, and is thus more similar to the North American versions of chow mein. Pastelarias and Asian restaurants serve it in the entire country. They generally are presented in chicken (the most common), beef, shrimp and pork versions, with vegetarian and egg versions being much rarer. Brazilian yakisoba is typically served much more al dente than the Japanese, being also heavy in soy sauce, sesame oil, and vegetables, almost always including at least carrot, cabbage, onion and at least one dark green species (usually other than kale, collard, spinach, chicory or mustard) such as Chinese cabbage, and less often either bean sprouts, broccoli/broccolini, zucchini, shiitake, bell pepper and/or cucumber. Also popular is yakibifum (, from Japanese yakibƒ´fun), its equivalent that uses rice vermicelli instead of wheat noodles. Brazilian spring rolls' (rolinhos-primavera or harumakis) fillings generally use the same ingredients of the stir-fried noodles in the restaurants or fast-food chains they are found, though spring rolls may have cheese, usually white (such as catupiry or other kinds of requeij√£o, or queijo minas), or tofu instead of meat, uncommon for the noodles. All of them, but most often and especially spring rolls, may be served with bright red molho agridoce (sweet-sour sauce), that combines ketchup, vinegar, sugar, star anise and other spices. =Canadian Chinese cuisine= Canadian westernized Chinese restaurants may offer up to three different types of chow mein, none of which is identical to either of the two types of American chow mein. Cantonese style chow mein contains deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles, green peppers, pea pods, bok choy, bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, shrimp, Chinese roast pork (char siu), chicken, and beef, and is served in a thick sauce. Plain chow mein is similar to other Western chow meins but contains far more mung bean sprouts; some regional recipes may substitute bean sprouts for noodles completely. In Canada, Hong Kong style chow mein is similar to plain chow mein but is always served on a bed of deep-fried crunchy golden egg noodles. The Japanese Canadian community also have their own version of chow mein that might include dried seaweed and pickle ginger and could be served in a bun. In Newfoundland, their chow mein does not contain any noodles. In place of noodles, cabbage cut in such a way to resemble noodles are used as a substitute. Although no one knows the reason why this change had occurred, it is believed that the island remoteness in the North Atlantic during its history as an independent self-governing British dominion contributed to the lack of availability of the necessary ingredients from the rest of North America or from Europe. =Caribbean Chinese cuisine= Many West Indian people include chow mein in their cuisine, especially peoples from islands like Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica which include a significant ethnic Chinese population; much of the cooking has infused itself into the population in general. As well, in the South American countries Guyana and Suriname the culture and cuisine is similar to the Caribbean's. These chow mein dishes are cooked in a similar manner, with green beans, carrots, peas, onions and sometimes other vegetables. Meat used is mostly chicken and sometimes pork and/or shrimp. The main difference is that local spices are added, and the dish is often served with hot Scotch bonnet peppers and/or pepper sauce. In Cuba, aside from the foreign-owned tourist hotels which often serve Western- style Chinese food, local Chinese restaurants can be found in Havana that offer a distinct Cuban style. In Panama, chow mein is prepared with a mixture of shredded carrots and cabbage with pork or chicken and served over noodles. Another recipe includes canned corn. =Indian Chinese cuisine= Kolkata style egg chow mein Bangladeshi-style chow mein Chow mein is also common in Indian Chinese, Bangladeshi Chinese, and Pakistani Chinese cuisine. In India, it was introduced by the Chinese of Calcutta. It is usually offered Hakka or with gravy. Catering to vegetarian diets, there is an Indian variant, vegetable chow mein, which consists of noodles with cabbage, bamboo shoots, pea pods, green peppers, and carrots. In the New Delhi area, chow mein can sometimes include paneer with the mixture of noodles and vegetables. Another non-meat Indian variant includes scrambled egg as a protein source. Kolkata has its own variant that is called Calcutta Chow Mein or Calcutta Chowmin that also includes green chilli, chilli garlic, or hot garlic. =Indonesian Chinese cuisine= There are two Indonesian versions of chow mein. One is Mie goreng, which is (sometimes spicy) stir-fried noodle dish with variants of toppings, and the other is a crispy noodle dish topped with sauce that is pretty popular and existed in virtually all Chinese restaurant in Indonesia. It goes popular with the name of I fu mie or Mi Siram, literally means drenched noodle, in Indonesian Chinese cuisine. In Indonesia, i fu mie is usually served with thick egg sauce with cauliflower, broccoli, mushroom, kekkian or prawn cake, and chicken. Several varieties does exists such as vegetarian and seafood that contains squid, prawn and fish instead of kekkian. The dish is often confused with Lo mein. =Mexican Chinese cuisine= Chow mein has gained popularity in Mexico, which received waves of Chinese immigrants in the past, particularly in northwestern Mexico. Mexicali, a city in Baja California, is known for its distinct style of chow mein, which typically use Mexican ingredients as substitutes for traditional Chinese ones, an adaption that was made by Chinese immigrants settling the area. =Nepalese cuisine= Nepalese-style hot chicken chow mein Tibetans who settled in Nepal brought chow mein with them. It is a popular fast food in Nepal. The Newari people of the Kathmandu Valley use water buffalo meat and chicken in their cuisine, and chow mein in Nepal is often cooked with onion, vegetables and buff (water buffalo meat). =Peruvian Chinese cuisine= Peruvian Tallarin Saltado Chinese food (Chifa) is very popular in Peru and is now a part of mainstream Peruvian culture. Chow mein is known to Peruvians as Tallar√≠n saltado and may contain peppers, onions, green onions, and tomatoes.

Financial problems and ownership In 2000, amid declining sales, founder Ho Man-fat sold Sing Pao to Optima Media Holding (the purchaser was also stated as StarEastNet Limited () and China Strategic Holdings Limited ()) for HK$150 million. In 2004, that company was itself bought and renamed Strategic Media International. At the time of the sale, it was announced that the reporting style would remain the same, but the main focus would shift to entertainment news and advertising.

As of June 2006, at least 60 employees have left Sing Pao, the Mandatory Provident Fund Schemes Authority is suing Sing Pao because of all the MPF Sing Pao has not paid, and the Labour Department is suing Sing Pao because of the unpaid wages. The Labour Department won and on 3 January 2007, Sing Pao was fined HK$4200. The media and the head of the Labour Department criticised the punishment as being too light. In face of the criticism, the magistrate reopened the case on his own initiative the next day, as authorised by law (Chapter 227, Section 104(5)). With the Magistrates' Courts, there is no functus officio: a magistrate can reopen his own case within 14 days. This led to other people criticising the magistrate's decision to reopen, saying it gives the impression of popular and executive interference in the judiciary.Audrey Eu, Ming Pao, 9 Jan 2007] In April 2015, the paper faced further difficulties, as creditor Korchina Culture filed a 'statutory demand notice' leading Sing Pao to seek a loan of HK$110 million. Amid the troubles, the paper ceased publication for several weeks from 17 July, and on 12 August the High Court ruled that the paper's indebted parent company, Sing Pao Media Enterprises, must be liquidated. With this move, the paper's immediate future was secure and publication continued. Reliability and criticism Although Sing Pao has a motto of reporting the truth fairly and objectively, it has faced criticism too. On 4 February 2003, a reader complained to the Hong Kong Journalists Association (HKJA) that Sing Pao published the full name, address and picture of a victim in their paper, which violated their personal privacy. Near the end of the 2012 Hong Kong Chief Executive election, Johnny Lau Yui-siu (ÂäâÈä≥Á¥π), a pundit who wrote a critique of both Henry Tang and Leung Chun-ying for the Sing Pao Daily News, complained that the journal of \\"unfairly editing and distorting his column\\", turning his article into one favouring Leung.\\"Newspaper accused of distorting column\\", RTHK, 21 March 2012 Archived from the original, 24 March 2012 Lau said that his intended piece was entitled \\"Neither Tang nor Leung is worthy of support\\". In the piece, he opined that \\"supporting either party would not be conducive to the situation\\", but the published version read: \\"If there is really a need to make a choice, then, let's choose Mr Leung Chun-ying.\\" Lau alleged that his conclusion was similarly distorted: \\"neither Mr Tang nor Mr Leung is worthy of support. They do not deserve sympathy either\\" was changed to read: \\"Mr Tang is not worthy of support. Nor does he deserve sympathy.\\" Ngai Kai-kwong, editor- in-chief of Sing Pao said: \\"the editing might have been too carelessly done.\\" He denied the paper had exercised censorship, nor that it had come under pressure from the central government's liaison office.Ng Kang-chung (24 March 2012). \\"Article 'twisted by an invisible hand'\\". South China Morning Post Citing format and budget reasons, Sing Pao dropped Lau's column alone in April. However, the HKJA rejected this explanation, and suggested that the cause was Lau's mourning of a deceased Chinese dissident Fang Lizhi in his column, which triggered a blockage of access to Sing Pao's online version in mainland.

The Manchu-led Qing dynasty ruled China proper from 1644 to 1912. The Republic experienced many trials and tribulations after its founding which included being dominated by elements as disparate as warlord generals and foreign powers. In 1928, the Republic was nominally unified under the Kuomintang (KMT; also called \\"Chinese Nationalist Party\\") after the Northern Expedition, and was in the early stages of industrialization and modernization when it was caught in the conflicts involving the Kuomintang government, the Communist Party of China (founded in 1921), local warlords, and the Empire of Japan. Most nation-building efforts were stopped during the full-scale Second Sino-Japanese War against Japan from 1937 to 1945, and later the widening gap between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party made a coalition government impossible, causing the resumption of the Chinese Civil War, in 1946, shortly after the Japanese surrender to the Allied Powers in September 1945. A series of political, economic and military missteps led to the KMT's defeat and its retreat to Taiwan (formerly \\"Formosa\\") in 1949, where it established an authoritarian one-party state continuing under Generalissimo/President Chiang Kai-shek. This state considered itself to be the continuing sole legitimate ruler of all of China, referring to the communist government or \\"regime\\" as illegitimate, a so-called \\"People's Republic of China\\" (PRC) declared in Beijing (Peking) by Mao Zedong in 1949, as \\"mainland China\\", \\"Communist China, or \\"Red China\\". The Republic of China was supported for many years ‚Äî even decades ‚Äî by many nations, especially the United States who established a 1954 Mutual Defense treaty. After political liberalization began in the late 1960s, the PRC was able ‚Äî after a constant yearly campaign in the United Nations ‚Äî to finally get approval in 1971 to take the seat for \\"China\\" in the General Assembly, and more importantly, be seated as one of the five permanent members of the Security Council. After recovering from this shock of rejection by its former allies and liberalization in the late 1970s from the Nationalist authoritarian government and following the death of Chiang Kai-shek, the Republic of China has transformed itself into a multiparty, representative democracy on Taiwan and given more representation to those native Taiwanese, whose ancestors predate the 1949 mainland evacuation. Early republic (1912‚Äì1916) =Founding of the republic= Sun Yat-sen proclaiming the establishment of the ROC in 1912 different flags were originally used during the Revolution. The bottom message says Long live the Republic! with the five races represented by the Five-Color Flag of the Republic. The last days of the Qing dynasty in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were marked by civil unrest and foreign invasions. Various internal rebellions caused millions of deaths, and conflicts with foreign Western European powers almost always resulted in humiliating unequal treaties that exacted costly reparations and compromised the country's territorial integrity. In addition, there were sentiments that political power should return to the majority Han Chinese from the minority Manchus from the northeastern province of Manchuria. Responding to these civil failures and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court attempted to reform the Imperial Government in various ways, such as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparations for electing a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to take the road of revolution. There were many revolutionary groups, but the most organized one was founded by Sun Yat-sen (), a republican and anti-Qing activist who became increasingly popular among overseas Chinese and Chinese students abroad, especially in Japan. In 1905 Sun founded the Tongmenghui in Tokyo with Huang Xing, a popular leader of the Chinese revolutionary movement in Japan, as his deputy. This movement, generously supported by overseas Chinese funds, also gained political support with regional military officers and some of the reformers who had fled China after the Hundred Days' Reform. Sun's political philosophy was conceptualized in 1897, first enunciated in Tokyo in 1905 and modified through the early 1920s. It centered on the Three Principles of the People: \\"nationalism, democracy, and people's livelihood\\". The principle of nationalism called for overthrowing the Manchus and ending foreign hegemony over China. The second principle, democracy, was used to describe Sun's goal of a popularly elected republican form of government and changes such as land reform.

The Republican Era of China began with the outbreak of revolution on 10 October 1911, in Wuchang, the capital of Hubei Province, among discontented modernized army units whose anti-Qing plot had been uncovered. This would be known as the Wuchang Uprising, which is celebrated as Double Tenth Day in Taiwan. It had been preceded by numerous abortive uprisings and organized protests inside China. The revolt quickly spread to neighboring cities, and Tongmenghui members throughout the country rose in support of the Wuchang revolutionary forces. On October 12 the Revolutionaries succeeded in capturing Hankou and Hanyang. However, the euphoria engendered by this victory was short-lived. On October 27, Yuan Shikai was reappointed by the Qing Court to lead the New Army, and loyalist forces under Feng Guozhang and Duan Qirui moved south to retake Wuhan. After heavy fighting in November, the out-manned and out-gunned Revolutionary Army was driven out of Hankou and Hanyang, and retreated to Wuchang south of the Yangtze. During the 41-day Battle of Yangxia, however, 15 of the 24 provinces had declared their independence from the Qing empire. Yuan Shikai halted his army's advance on Wuchang and began to negotiate with the revolutionaries. A month later, Sun Yat-sen returned to China from the United States, where he had been raising funds among Chinese and American sympathizers. On 1 January 1912, delegates from the independent provinces elected Sun Yat-sen as the first Provisional President of the Republic of China. Yuan Shikai agreed to accept the Republic and forced the last emperor of China, Puyi, to abdicate on February 12. Empress Dowager Longyu signed the abdication papers. Puyi was allowed to continue living in the Forbidden City, however. The Republic of China officially succeeded the Qing Dynasty. Some advocated that a Han be installed as Emperor, either the descendant of Confucius, who was the Duke Yansheng, or the Ming dynasty Imperial family descendant, the Marquis of Extended Grace. =Early republic= On 1 January 1912, Sun officially declared the establishment of the Republic of China and was inaugurated in Nanjing as the first Provisional President. However, power in Beijing already had passed to Yuan Shikai, who had effective control of the Beiyang Army, the most powerful military force in China at the time. To prevent civil war and possible foreign intervention from undermining the infant republic, Sun agreed to Yuan's demand for China to be united under a Beijing government headed by him. On March 10, in Beijing, Yuan Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.

The republic which Sun Yat-sen and his associates envisaged evolved slowly. Although there were many political parties vying for supremacy in the legislature, the revolutionists lacked an army, and soon Yuan Shikai's power began to outstrip that of parliament. Yuan revised the constitution on his own and became dictatorial. In August 1912 the Kuomintang (Nationalist Party) was founded by Song Jiaoren, one of Sun's associates. It was an amalgamation of small political groups, including Sun's Tongmenghui. In the national elections held in February 1913 for the new bicameral parliament, Song campaigned against the Yuan administration, whose representation at the time was largely by the Republican Party, led by Liang Qichao. Song was an able campaigner and the Kuomintang won a majority of seats. =Journalism= The overthrow of the old imperial regime in 1911 produced a surge in Chinese nationalism, an end to censorship, and a demand for professional, nation-wide journalism.Stephen MacKinnon, ‚ÄúToward a History of the Chinese Press in the Republican Period,‚Äù Modern China 23#1 (1997) pp. 3-32 All the major cities launched such efforts. Special attention was paid to China's role in the World War, to the disappointing Paris Peace Conference of 1919, and to the aggressive demands and actions of Japan against Chinese interests. Journalists created professional organizations, and aspired to separate news from commentary. At the Press Congress of the World conference in Honolulu in 1921, the Chinese delegates were among the most Westernized and self-consciously professional journalists from the developing world. By the late 1920s, however, there was a much greater emphasis on advertising and expanding circulation, and much less interest in the sort of advocacy journalism that had inspired the revolutionaries.Timothy B. Weston, \\"China, professional journalism, and liberal internationalism in the era of the First World War.\\" Pacific Affairs 83.2 (2010): 327-347. =Second Revolution= Song was assassinated in March 1913. Some people believe that Yuan Shikai was responsible, and although it has never been proven, he had already arranged the assassination of several pro-revolutionist generals. Animosity towards Yuan grew. In April he secured a Reorganization Loan of 25 million pounds sterling from Great Britain, France, Russia, Germany and Japan, without consulting the parliament first. The loan was used to finance Yuan's Beiyang Army. On May 20 Yuan concluded a deal with Russia that granted Russia special privileges in Outer Mongolia and restricted Chinese right to station troops there. Kuomintang members of the Parliament accused Yuan of abusing his rights and called for his removal. On the other hand, the Progressive Party (), which was composed of constitutional monarchists and supported Yuan, accused the Kuomintang of fomenting an insurrection. Yuan then decided to use military action against the Kuomintang. In July 1913 seven southern provinces rebelled against Yuan, beginning the Second Revolution (). There were several underlying reasons for the Second Revolution besides Yuan's abuse of power. First was that most Revolutionary Armies from different provinces were disbanded after the establishment of the Republic of China, and many officers and soldiers felt that they were not compensated for toppling the Qing Dynasty. These factors gave rise to much discontent against the new government among the military. Secondly, many revolutionaries felt that Yuan Shikai and Li Yuanhong were undeserving of the posts of presidency and vice presidency, because they acquired the posts through political maneuvering rather than participation in the revolutionary movement. Lastly, Yuan's use of violence (such as Song's assassination) dashed the Kuomintang's hope of achieving reforms and political goals through electoral means. However, the Second Revolution did not fare well for the Kuomintang. The leading Kuomintang military force of Jiangxi was defeated by Yuan's forces on August 1 and Nanchang was taken. On September 1, Nanjing was taken. When the rebellion was suppressed, Sun and other instigators fled to Japan. In October 1913 an intimidated parliament formally elected Yuan Shikai President of the Republic of China, and the major powers extended recognition to his government. Duan Qirui and other trusted Beiyang generals were given prominent positions in the cabinet. To achieve international recognition, Yuan Shikai had to agree to autonomy for Outer Mongolia and Tibet. China was still to be suzerain, but it would have to allow Russia a free hand in Outer Mongolia and Tanna Tuva and Britain continuation of its influence in Tibet. =Mass banditry, Yuan Shikai and the National Protection War= Yuan Shikai as the Emperor of the Empire of China (1915‚Äì16). Bandit leaders with popular movements instigated revolts, with the support of Sun Yat-sen's revolutionaries from Canton. The bandit-led Bai Lang Rebellion ransacked and destroyed much of central China before it was crushed by the Beiyang Army of Yuan Shikai, the Muslim Ma clique and Tibetan militia. These bandits were associated with the Gelaohui. In November Yuan Shikai, legally president, ordered the Kuomintang dissolved and forcefully removed its members from parliament. Because the majority of the parliament members belonged to the Kuomintang, the parliament did not meet quorum and was subsequently unable to convene. In January 1914 Yuan formally suspended the parliament. In February he called into session a meeting to revise the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China, which was announced in May of that year. The revision greatly expanded Yuan's powers, allowing him to declare war, sign treaties and appoint officials without seeking approval from the legislature first. In December 1914 he further revised the law and lengthened the term of the President to ten years, with no term limit. Essentially, Yuan was preparing for his ascendancy as the emperor. On the other hand, since the failure of the Second Revolution, Sun Yat-sen and his allies were trying to rebuild the revolutionary movement. In July 1914 Sun established the Chinese Revolutionary Party (). He felt that his failures at building a consistent revolutionary movement stemmed from the lack of cohesiveness among its members. To that end, Sun required that party members to be totally loyal to Sun and follow a series of rather harsh rules. Some of his earlier associates, including Huang Xing, balked at the idea of such authoritarian organization and refused to join Sun. However, they agreed that the republic must not revert to imperial rule. Besides the revolutionary groups associated with Sun, there were also several other groups aimed at toppling Yuan Shikai. One was the Progressive Party, the original constitutional-monarchist party that opposed the Kuomintang during the Second Revolution. The Progressive Party switched their position largely because of Yuan's sabotage of the national parliament. Secondly, many provincial governors who had declared their independence from the Qing Imperial Court in 1912 found the idea of supporting another Imperial Court utterly ridiculous. Yuan also alienated his Beiyang generals by centralizing tax collection from local authorities. In addition, public opinion was overwhelmingly anti-Yuan. When World War I broke out in 1914, Japan fought on the Allied side and seized German holdings in Shandong Province. In 1915 the Japanese set before the government in Beijing the so-called Twenty-One Demands, aimed at securing Japanese economic controls in railway and mining operations in Shandong, Manchuria and Fujian. The Japanese also pressed to have Yuan Shikai appoint Japanese advisors to key positions in the Chinese government. The Twenty-One Demands would have made China effectively a Japanese protectorate. The Beijing government rejected some of these demands but yielded to the Japanese insistence on keeping the Shandong territory already in its possession. Beijing also recognized Tokyo's authority over southern Manchuria and eastern Inner Mongolia. Yuan's acceptance of the demands was extremely unpopular, but he continued his monarchist agenda nevertheless. On 12 December 1915 Yuan, supported by his son Yuan Keding, declared himself emperor of a new Empire of China. This sent shock waves throughout China, causing widespread rebellion in numerous provinces. On 25 December former Yunnan governor Cai E, former Jiangxi governor Li Liejun () and Yunnan Gen. Tang Jiyao formed the National Protection Army () and declared Yunnan independent. Thus began the National Protection War (). Yunnan's declaration of independence also encouraged other southern provinces to declare theirs. Yuan's Beiyang generals, who were already wary of his imperial coronation, did not put up an aggressive campaign against the National Protection Army. On 22 March 1916 Yuan formally repudiated monarchy and stepped down as the first and last emperor of his dynasty. He died on 6 June of that year. Vice President Li Yuanhong assumed the presidency and appointed Beiyang Gen. Duan Qirui as his Premier. Yuan Shikai's imperial ambitions finally ended with the return of republican government. Warlord Era (1916‚Äì1928) Flag of the Republic of China, Five-colored flag (1912‚Äì1928), means Five Races Under One Union. Flag of the Republic of China (from 1927), Blue Sky, White Sun with 12 rays, and Wholly Red field. After Yuan Shikai's death, shifting alliances of regional warlords fought for control of the Beijing government. Despite the fact that various warlords gained control of the government in Beijing during the warlord era, this did not constitute a new era of control or governance, because other warlords did not acknowledge the transitory governments in this period and were a law unto themselves. These military-dominated governments were collectively known as the Beiyang Government. The warlord era is considered by some historians to have ended in 1927. =World War I and brief Manchu restoration= After Yuan Shikai's death, Li Yuanhong became the President and Duan Qirui became the Premier. The Provisional Constitution was reinstated and the parliament convened. However, Li Yuanhong and Duan Qirui had many conflicts, the most glaring of which was over China's entry into World War I. Since the outbreak of the war, China had remained neutral until the United States urged all neutral countries to join the Allies, as a condemnation of Germany's use of unrestricted submarine warfare. Premier Duan Qirui was particularly interested in joining the Allies as an opportunity to secure loans from Japan to build up his Anhui clique army. The two factions in the parliament engaged in ugly debates regarding the entry of China and, in May 1917, Li Yuanhong dismissed Duan Qirui from his government. This led provincial military governors loyal to Duan to declare independence and to call for Li Yuanhong to step down as President. Li Yuanhong summoned Zhang Xun to mediate the situation. Zhang Xun had been a general serving the Qing Court and was by this time the military governor of Anhui province. He had his mind on restoring Puyi (Xuantong Emperor) to the imperial throne. Zhang was supplied with funds and weapons through the German legation, which was eager to keep China neutral. On 1 July 1917, Zhang officially proclaimed the restoration of Qing dynasty and requested that Li Yuanhong give up his presidency, which Li promptly rejected. Duan Qirui led his army and defeated Zhang Xun's restoration forces in Beijing. One of Duan's airplanes bombed the Forbidden City, in what was possibly the first aerial bombardment in East Asia. On July 12 Zhang's forces disintegrated and Duan returned to Beijing. The Manchu restoration ended almost as soon as it began. During this period of confusion, Vice President Feng Guozhang, also a Beiyang general, assumed the post of Acting President of the republic and took his oath of office in Nanjing. Duan Qirui resumed his post as the Premier. The Zhili clique of Feng Guozhang and the Anhui clique of Duan Qirui emerged as the most powerful cliques following the restoration affair. Duan Qirui's triumphant return to Beijing essentially made him the most powerful leader in China. Duan dissolved the parliament upon his return and declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary on 14 August 1917. German and Austro-Hungarian nationals were detained and their assets seized. Around 175,000 Chinese workers volunteered for labor battalions after being enticed with money, some even years before war was declared. They were sent to the Western Front, German East Africa and Mesopotamia and served on supply ships. Some 10,000 died, including over 500 on ships sunk by U-boats. No soldiers were sent overseas, though they did participate with the Allies in the Siberian Intervention under Japanese General Kikuzo Otani. =Constitutional Protection War= In September Duan's complete disregard for the constitution caused Sun Yat-sen, Cen Chunxuan and the deposed parliament members to establish a new government in Guangzhou and the Constitutional Protection Army () to counter Duan's abuse of power. Ironically, Sun Yat-sen's new government was not based on the Provisional Constitution; rather, it was a military government and Sun was its \\"Grand Commander of the Armed Forces\\" (, translated in the Western press as \\"Generalissimo\\"). Six southern provinces became part of Sun's Guangzhou military government and repelled Duan's attempt to destroy the Constitutional Protection Army. The Constitutional Protection War continued through 1918. Many in Sun Yat-sen's Guangzhou government felt his position as the Generalissimo was too exclusionary and promoted a cabinet system to challenge Sun's ultimate authority. As a result, the Guangzhou government was reorganized to elect a seven-member cabinet system, known as the Governing Committee. Sun was once again sidelined by his political opponents and military strongmen. He left for Shanghai following the reorganization. Duan Qirui's Beijing government did not fare much better than Sun's. Some generals in Duan's Anhui Clique and others in the Zhili clique did not want to use force to unify the southern provinces. They felt negotiation was the solution to unify China and forced Duan to resign in October. In addition, many were distressed by Duan's borrowing of huge sums of Japanese money to fund his army to fight internal enemies. President Feng Guozhang, with his term expiring, was then succeeded by Xu Shichang, who wanted to negotiate with the southern provinces. In February 1919 delegates from the northern and southern provinces convened in Shanghai to discuss postwar situations. However, the meeting broke down over Duan's taking out Japanese loans to fund the Anhui Clique army, and further attempts at negotiation were hampered by the May Fourth Movement. The Constitutional Protection War essentially left China divided along the north‚Äìsouth border. =May Fourth Movement= Students in Beijing rallied during the May Fourth Movement. In 1917 China declared war on Germany in the hope of recovering its lost province, then under Japanese control. On 4 May 1919, there were massive student demonstrations against the Beijing government and Japan. The political fervor, student activism and iconoclastic and reformist intellectual currents set in motion by the patriotic student protest developed into a national awakening known as the May Fourth Movement. The intellectual milieu in which the May Fourth Movement developed was known as the New Culture Movement and occupied the period 1917‚Äì1923. The student demonstrations of 4 May 1919, were the high point of the New Culture Movement, and the terms are often used synonymously. Chinese representatives refused to sign the Treaty of Versailles due to intense pressure from both the student protesters and public opinion. =Fight against warlordism and the First United Front= The May Fourth Movement helped to rekindle the then-fading cause of republican revolution. In 1917 Sun Yat-sen had become commander-in- chief of a rival military government in Canton in collaboration with southern warlords. In October 1919 he re-established the Kuomintang (KMT) to counter the government in Beijing. The latter, under a succession of warlords, still maintained its facade of legitimacy and its relations with the West. By 1921 Sun had become president of the southern government. He spent his remaining years trying to consolidate his regime and achieve unity with the north. His efforts to obtain aid from the Western democracies were fruitless, however, and in 1920 he turned to the Soviet Union, which had recently achieved its own revolution. The Soviets sought to befriend the Chinese revolutionists by offering scathing attacks on Western imperialism. For political expediency, though, the Soviet leadership initiated a dual policy of support for both Sun and the newly established Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Major Chinese warlord coalitions as of 1925 In 1922 the Kuomintang-warlord alliance in Guangzhou was ruptured, and Sun fled to Shanghai. By then he saw the need to seek Soviet support for his cause. In 1923 a joint statement by Sun and a Soviet representative in Shanghai pledged Soviet assistance for China's national unification. Soviet advisers‚Äîthe most prominent of whom was an agent of the Comintern, Mikhail Borodin‚Äîbegan to arrive in China in 1923 to aid in the reorganization and consolidation of the Kuomintang along the lines of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and establish the First United Front. The CCP was under Comintern instructions to cooperate with the Kuomintang, and its members were encouraged to join while maintaining their party identities to form a \\"bloc within.\\" The policy of working with the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek had been recommended by the Dutch Communist Henk Sneevliet, chosen in 1923 to be the Comintern representative in China due to his revolutionary experience in the Dutch Indies, where he had a major role in founding the Partai Komunis Indonesia (PKI), and who felt that the Chinese party was too small and weak to undertake a major effort on its own. The CCP was still small at the time, having a membership of just 300 in 1921 and only 1,500 by 1925. By contrast, the Kuomintang in 1922 already had 150,000 members. Soviet advisers also helped the Kuomintang set up a political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 sent Chiang Kai- shek, one of Sun's lieutenants from Tongmenghui days, for several months' military and political study in Moscow. After Chiang's return in late 1923, he participated in the establishment of the Whampoa Military Academy outside Guangzhou, which was the seat of government under the Kuomintang-CCP alliance. In 1924 Chiang became head of the academy and began the rise to prominence that would make him Sun's successor as head of the Kuomintang and the unifier of all China under the right-wing Nationalist Government. =Chiang consolidates power= National Revolutionary Army soldiers march into the British concessions in Hubei during the Northern Expedition. Sun Yat-sen died of cancer in Beijing in March 1925, as the Nationalist movement he had helped to initiate was gaining momentum. During the summer of 1925 Chiang, as commander-in-chief of the National Revolutionary Army, set out on the long- delayed Northern Expedition against the northern warlords. Within nine months half of China had been conquered. By 1926, however, the Kuomintang had divided into left- and right-wing factions, and the Communist bloc within it was also growing. In March 1926, after thwarting a kidnapping attempt against him (Zhongshan Warship Incident), Chiang abruptly dismissed his Soviet advisers, imposed restrictions on CCP members' participation in the top leadership and emerged as the pre-eminent Kuomintang leader. The Soviet Union, still hoping to prevent a split between Chiang and the CCP, ordered Communist underground activities to facilitate the Northern Expedition, which was finally launched by Chiang from Guangzhou in July 1926. In early 1927 the Kuomintang-CCP rivalry led to a split in the revolutionary ranks. The CCP and the left wing of the Kuomintang decided to move the seat of the Nationalist government from Guangzhou to Wuhan. Chiang, whose Northern Expedition was proving successful, set his forces to destroying the Shanghai CCP apparatus and established an anti-Communist government at Nanjing in the Shanghai massacre of 1927. There now were three capitals in China: the internationally recognized warlord regime in Beijing; the Communist and left-wing Kuomintang regime at Wuhan; and the right-wing civilian-military regime at Nanjing, which would remain the Kuomintang capital for the next decade. The Comintern cause appeared bankrupt. A new policy was instituted calling on the CCP to foment armed insurrections in both urban and rural areas in preparation for an expected rising tide of revolution. Unsuccessful attempts were made by Communists to take cities such as Nanchang, Changsha, Shantou and Guangzhou, and an armed rural insurrection, known as the Autumn Harvest Uprising, was staged by peasants in Hunan province. The insurrection was led by Mao Zedong, who would later become chairman of the CCP and head of state of the People's Republic of China. In mid-1927, however, the CCP's fortunes were at a low ebb. The Communists had been expelled from Wuhan by their left-wing Kuomintang allies, who in turn were toppled by a military regime. By 1928 all of China was at least nominally under Chiang's control, and the Nanjing government received prompt international recognition as the sole legitimate government of China. The Kuomintang government announced that in conformity with Sun Yat-sen's formula for the three stages of revolution‚Äîmilitary unification, political tutelage and constitutional democracy‚ÄîChina had reached the end of the first phase and would embark on the second, which would be under Kuomintang direction. Nanjing decade (1928‚Äì1937) With help from Germany, Chinese industry and its military were improved just prior to the war against Japan. The \\"Nanjing Decade\\" of 1928-37 was one of consolidation and accomplishment under the leadership of the Nationalists, with a mixed but generally positive record in the economy, social progress, development of democracy and cultural creativity. Some of the harsh aspects of foreign concessions and privileges in China were moderated through diplomacy. In May 1930 the government regained the right to set its tariff, which before then had been set by the foreign powers. Administrative map of China in 1935 with the administrative division of Manchukuo The Nationalist Government also acted energetically to modernize the legal and penal systems, stabilize prices, amortize debts, reform the banking and currency systems, build railroads and highways, improve public health facilities, legislate against traffic in narcotics and augment industrial and agricultural production. On 3 November 1935, the government instituted the fiat currency (fapi) reform, immediately stabilizing prices and also raising revenues for the government. Great strides also were made in education and, in an effort to help unify Chinese society, in a program to popularize Modern Standard Chinese and overcome other varieties of Chinese. Newspapers, magazines and book publishing flourished, and the widespread establishment of communications facilities further encouraged a sense of unity and pride among the people. Laws were passed and campaigns mounted to promote the rights of women, The ease and speed of communication also allowed a focus on social problems, including those of the villages. The Rural Reconstruction Movement was one of many which took advantage of the new freedom to raise social consciousness. On the other hand, political freedom was considerably curtailed because of the Kuomintang's one-party domination through \\"political tutelage\\" and often violent means in shutting down anti-government protests. During this time, a series of massive wars took place in western China, including the Kumul Rebellion, the Sino-Tibetan War and the Soviet invasion of Xinjiang. Although the central government was nominally in control of the entire country during this period, large areas of China remained under the semi-autonomous rule of local warlords, provincial military leaders or warlord coalitions. Nationalist rule was strongest in the eastern regions around the capital Nanjing, but regional militarists such as Feng Yuxiang and Yan Xishan retained considerable local authority. The Central Plains War in 1930, the Japanese aggression in 1931 and the Red Army's Long March in 1934 led to more power for the central government, but there continued to be foot-dragging and even outright defiance, as in the Fujian Rebellion of 1933‚Äì34. Second Sino- Japanese War (1937‚Äì1945) Few Chinese had any illusions about Japanese desires on China. Hungry for raw materials and pressed by a growing population, Japan initiated the seizure of Manchuria on 18 September 1931 and established ex-Qing emperor Puyi as head of the puppet state of Manchukuo in 1932. The loss of Manchuria, and its vast potential for industrial development and war industries, was a blow to the Kuomintang economy. The League of Nations, established at the end of World War I, was unable to act in the face of the Japanese defiance. The Japanese began to push from south of the Great Wall into northern China and the coastal provinces. Chinese fury against Japan was predictable, but anger was also directed against Chiang and the Nanking government, which at the time was more preoccupied with anti-Communist extermination campaigns than with resisting the Japanese invaders. The importance of \\"internal unity before external danger\\" was forcefully brought home in December 1936, when Chiang Kai-shek, in an event now known as the Xi'an Incident, was kidnapped by Zhang Xueliang and forced to ally with the Communists against the Japanese in the Second Kuomintang-CCP United Front against Japan. Madame Chiang Kai-shek with Gen. Joseph Stilwell in Burma (1942). The Chinese resistance stiffened after 7 July 1937, when a clash occurred between Chinese and Japanese troops outside Beijing (then named Beiping) near the Marco Polo Bridge. This skirmish led to open, though undeclared, warfare between China and Japan. Shanghai fell after a three-month battle during which Japan suffered extensive casualties, both in its army and navy. The capital of Nanjing fell in December 1937. It was followed by an onslaught of mass murders and rapes known as the Nanjing Massacre. The national capital was briefly at Wuhan, then removed in an epic retreat to Chongqing, the seat of government until 1945. In 1940 the collaborationist Wang Jingwei regime was set up with its capital in Nanjing, proclaiming itself the legitimate \\"Republic of China\\" in opposition to Chiang Kai-shek's government, though its claims were significantly hampered due to its nature as a Japanese puppet state controlling limited amounts of territory, along with its subsequent defeat at the end of the war. The United Front between the Kuomintang and CCP took place with salutary effects for the beleaguered CCP, despite Japan's steady territorial gains in northern China, the coastal regions and the rich Yangtze River Valley in central China. After 1940 conflicts between the Kuomintang and Communists became more frequent in the areas not under Japanese control. The entrance of the United States into the Pacific War after 1941 changed the nature of their relationship. The Communists expanded their influence wherever opportunities presented themselves through mass organizations, administrative reforms and the land- and tax-reform measures favoring the peasants and the spread of their organizational network, while the Kuomintang attempted to neutralize the spread of Communist influence. Meanwhile, northern China was infiltrated politically by Japanese politicians in Manchukuo using facilities such as Wei Huang Gong. In 1945 the Republic of China emerged from the war nominally a great military power but actually a nation economically prostrate and on the verge of all-out civil war. The economy deteriorated, sapped by the military demands of foreign war and internal strife, by spiraling inflation and by Nationalist profiteering, speculation and hoarding. Starvation came in the wake of the war, and millions were rendered homeless by floods and the unsettled conditions in many parts of the country. The situation was further complicated by an Allied agreement at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 that brought Soviet troops into Manchuria to hasten the termination of war against Japan. Although the Chinese had not been present at Yalta, they had been consulted and had agreed to have the Soviets enter the war in the belief that the Soviet Union would deal only with the Kuomintang government. After the end of the war in August 1945, the Nationalist Government moved back to Nanjing. With American help, Nationalist troops moved to take the Japanese surrender in North China. The Soviet Union, as part of the Yalta agreement allowing a Soviet sphere of influence in Manchuria, dismantled and removed more than half the industrial equipment left there by the Japanese. The Soviet presence in northeast China enabled the Communists to move in long enough to arm themselves with the equipment surrendered by the withdrawing Japanese army. The problems of rehabilitating the formerly Japanese-occupied areas and of reconstructing the nation from the ravages of a protracted war were staggering. Chinese Civil War (1945‚Äì1949) During World War II the United States emerged as a major player in Chinese affairs. As an ally it embarked in late 1941 on a program of massive military and financial aid to the hard- pressed Nationalist Government. In January 1943 the United States and Britain led the way in revising their treaties with China, bringing to an end a century of unequal treaty relations. Within a few months a new agreement was signed between the United States and the Republic of China for the stationing of American troops in China for the common war effort against Japan. In December 1943 the Chinese Exclusion Acts of the 1880s and subsequent laws enacted by the United States Congress to restrict Chinese immigration into the United States were repealed. The wartime policy of the United States was initially to help China become a strong ally and a stabilizing force in postwar East Asia. As the conflict between the Kuomintang and the Communists intensified, however, the United States sought unsuccessfully to reconcile the rival forces for a more effective anti-Japanese war effort. Toward the end of the war, United States Marines were used to hold Beiping (Beijing) and Tianjin against a possible Soviet incursion, and logistic support was given to Kuomintang forces in north and northeast China. Through the mediating influence of the United States a military truce was arranged in January 1946, but battles between the Kuomintang and Communists soon resumed. Public opinion of the administrative incompetence of the Republic of China government was escalated and incited by the Communists in the nationwide student protest against mishandling of a rape accusation in early 1947 and another national protest against monetary reforms later that year. Realizing that no American efforts short of large-scale armed intervention could stop the coming war, the United States withdrew the American mission, headed by Gen. George Marshall, in early 1947. The Chinese Civil War became more widespread; battles raged not only for territories but also for the allegiance of cross-sections of the population. The United States aided the Nationalists with massive economic loans and weapons but no combat support. The Nationalists' retreat to Taipei: after the Nationalists lost Nanjing (Nanking) they next moved to Guangzhou (Canton), then to Chongqing (Chungking), Chengdu (Chengtu) and Xichang (Sichang) before arriving in Taipei. Belatedly, the Republic of China government sought to enlist popular support through internal reforms. The effort was in vain, however, because of rampant government corruption and the accompanying political and economic chaos. By late 1948 the Kuomintang position was bleak. The demoralized and undisciplined Kuomintang troops proved to be no match for the motivated and disciplined Communist People's Liberation Army, earlier known as the Red Army. The Communists were well established in the north and northeast. Although the Kuomintang had an advantage in numbers of men and weapons, controlled a much larger territory and population than their adversaries and enjoyed considerable international support, they were exhausted by the long war with Japan and in-fighting among various generals. They were also losing the propaganda war to the Communists, with a population weary of Kuomintang corruption and yearning for peace. In January 1949 Beiping was taken by the Communists without a fight, and its name changed back to Beijing. Between April and November, major cities passed from Kuomintang to Communist control with minimal resistance. In most cases the surrounding countryside and small towns had come under Communist influence long before the cities. Finally, on 1 October 1949, Communists founded the People's Republic of China. After 1 October 1949 Chiang Kai-shek and a few hundred thousand Republic of China troops and two million refugees, predominantly from the government and business community, fled from mainland China to the island of Taiwan; there remained in China itself only isolated pockets of resistance. On 7 December 1949 Chiang proclaimed Taipei, Taiwan, the temporary capital of the Republic of China. During the civil war both the Nationalists and Communists carried out mass atrocities with millions of non-combatants killed by both sides during the civil war.Rummel, Rudolph (1994), Death by Government. Benjamin Valentino has estimated atrocities in the Chinese Civil War resulted in the death of between 1.8 million and 3.5 million people between 1927 and 1949. Atrocities include deaths from forced conscription and massacres.Valentino, Benjamin A. Final solutions: mass killing and genocide in the twentieth century Cornell University Press. 8 December 2005. p88 Republic of China based in Taiwan (after 1949) =Cross-straits relations and international position in 1949‚Äì1970= At the end of 1943 the Cairo Declaration was issued, including among its clauses that all territories of China‚Äîincluding Formosa (Taiwan)‚Äîthat Japan had occupied would be returned to the Republic of China. This was reiterated in the Potsdam Declaration, issued in 1945. Later that year World War II ended, and Japan accepted the Potsdam Declaration, surrendering unconditionally. The Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces ordered that Japanese forces in Taiwan surrender to the government of the Republic of China, which acted as a representative of allied powers. The United States and the United Kingdom--the other two participants of the Cairo Declaration--however, regard that the Cairo Declaration and the Potsdam Declaration are merely statements of intention and have no binding force of law. On 25 October 1945, in Taipei Zhongshan Hall, the Japanese government in Taiwan surrendered to Chen Yi, the representative of the Republic of China, which was the representative of the Allied Powers. The Republic of China started to administer Taiwan. In 1951 Japan formally signed the Treaty of San Francisco but, due to the unclear situation of the Chinese civil war, the peace treaty did not clearly indicate to whom Taiwan's sovereignty belonged. In the second article of the 1952 Treaty of Taipei, following the Treaty of San Francisco, Japan reiterated its abandonment of sovereignty of Taiwan, the Pescadores, the Spratlys and the Paracels in the Treaty of San Francisco. Territories claimed by Republic of China from 1945 to 2005. The People's Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (ROC) continued a state of war until 1979. In October 1949 a PRC attempt to take the ROC-controlled island of Kinmen was thwarted in the Battle of Kuningtou, halting the PLA advance towards Taiwan. The Communists' other amphibious operations of 1950 were more successful: they led to the Communist conquest of Hainan Island in April 1950, capture of Wanshan Islands off the Guangdong coast (May‚ÄìAugust 1950) and of Zhoushan Island off Zhejiang (May 1950).MacFarquhar, Roderick. Fairbank, John K. Twitchett, Denis C. [1991] (1991). The Cambridge History of China. Cambridge University Press. . pg 820. In June 1949 the ROC declared a \\"closure\\" of all mainland China ports and its navy attempted to intercept all foreign ships. The closure covered from a point north of the mouth of the Min River in Fujian province to the mouth of the Liao River in Manchuria.Tsang, Steve Yui-Sang Tsang. The Cold War's Odd Couple: The Unintended Partnership Between the Republic of China and the UK, 1950‚Äì1958. [2006] (2006). I.B. Tauris. . p 155, p 115-120, p 139-145 Since mainland China's railroad network was underdeveloped, north‚Äìsouth trade depended heavily on sea lanes. ROC naval activity also caused severe hardship for mainland China fishermen. After losing mainland China, a group of approximately 12,000 KMT soldiers escaped to Burma and continued launching guerrilla attacks into south China. Their leader, Gen. Li Mi, was paid a salary by the ROC government and given the nominal title of Governor of Yunnan. Initially the United States supported these remnants and the Central Intelligence Agency provided them with aid. After the Burmese government appealed to the United Nations in 1953, however, the U.S. began pressuring the ROC to withdraw its loyalists. By the end of 1954 nearly 6,000 soldiers had left Burma and Li Mi declared his army disbanded. However, thousands remained, and the ROC continued to supply and command them, even secretly supplying reinforcements at times. During the Korean War, some captured Communist Chinese soldiers, many of whom were originally KMT soldiers, were repatriated to Taiwan rather than mainland China. A KMT guerrilla force continued to operate cross-border raids into southwestern China in the early 1950s. The ROC government launched a number of air bombing raids into key coastal cities of mainland China such as Shanghai. Though viewed as a military liability by the United States, the ROC viewed its remaining islands in Fujian as vital for any future campaign to defeat the PRC and retake mainland China. On 3 September 1954, the First Taiwan Strait Crisis began when the PLA started shelling Quemoy and threatened to take the Dachen Islands. On 20 January 1955, the PLA took nearby Yijiangshan Island, with the entire ROC garrison of 720 troops killed or wounded defending the island. On January 24 of the same year, the United States Congress passed the Formosa Resolution authorizing the President to defend the ROC's offshore islands. The First Taiwan Straits crisis ended in March 1955 when the PLA ceased its bombardment. The crisis was brought to a close during the Bandung Conference. The Second Taiwan Strait Crisis began on 23 August 1958, with air and naval engagements between the PRC and the ROC military forces, leading to intense artillery bombardment of Quemoy (by the PRC) and Amoy (by the ROC), and ended on November of the same year. PLA patrol boats blockaded the islands, keeping out ROC supply ships. Though the United States rejected Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to bomb mainland China artillery batteries, it quickly moved to supply fighter jets and anti-aircraft missiles to the ROC. It also provided amphibious assault ships to land supplies, as a sunken ROC naval vessel was blocking the harbor. On September 7 the United States escorted a convoy of ROC supply ships and the PRC refrained from firing. On October 25 the PRC announced an \\"even-day ceasefire\\" -- the PLA would only shell Quemoy on odd- numbered days. Despite the end of the hostilities, the two sides have never signed any agreement or treaty to officially end the war. After the 1950s, the \\"war\\" became more symbolic than real, represented by on again, off again artillery bombardment towards and from Kinmen. In later years, live shells were replaced with propaganda sheets. The bombardment finally ceased in 1979 after the establishment of diplomatic relations between the People's Republic of China and the United States. During this period, movement of people and goods virtually ceased between PRC- and ROC-controlled territories. There were occasional defectors. One high-profile defector was Justin Yifu Lin, who swam across the Kinmen strait to mainland China and is now Chief Economist and Senior Vice President of the World Bank. Most observers expected Chiang's government to eventually fall in response to a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. Things changed radically with the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President Harry S. Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.Bush, Richard C. [2005] (2005). Untying the Knot: Making Peace in the Taiwan Strait. Brookings Institution Press. . After the ROC complained to the United Nations against the Soviet Union supporting the PRC, the UN General Assembly Resolution 505 was adopted on 1 February 1952 to condemn the Soviet Union. =Tensions between Mainlanders and people of Taiwan= After World War II, General Order No. 1 ordered the forces of the Empire of Japan in Taiwan to surrender to Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek. The Republic of China appointed Chen Yi as the Chief Executive of Taiwan. He arrived in Taiwan on 24 October 1945 and received the last Japanese governor, Ando Rikichi, who signed the document of surrender on the next day. On the next day, Chen Yi proclaimed Taiwan Retrocession Day. The validity of the proclamation is subject to some debate however, with some supporters of Taiwan independence arguing that it is invalid, and that the date simply marks the start of a military occupation by the Republic of China. During the immediate postwar period, the Chinese Kuomintang administration on Taiwan was inept and corrupt, while soldiers were breaking the laws.http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/history/tw08.html \\"In addition, the fact that many mainland Chinese officials were incompetent and corrupt and soldiers broke the law aroused antipathy and disdain from Taiwan‚Äôs people, heightening antagonism between the public and government officials.\\" Many Taiwanese people were disillusioned with the incoming Kuomintang administration, which proved to be as harsh as Japanese imperial rule. Anti-mainlander violence flared on 28 February 1947 following an accidental shooting of a cigarette vendor by the police. The resulting February 28 Incident became a pivotal event in the shaping of modern Taiwanese identity. For several weeks after the incident, many Taiwanese rebelled, participating in island-wide riots protesting the government's corruption and harsh rule. The governor, Chen Yi, while negotiating with leaders of the protest movement, called for troops from mainland China. The Kuomintang, allegedly fearing a Communist infiltration, assembled a large military force to quell the disturbance in Taiwan, in the process killing many and imprisoning thousands of others. Many of the Taiwanese who had formed home rule groups under the Japanese were the victims of the incident, as were civilian mainlanders who bore the brunt of vigilante retaliation. This was followed by martial law and the \\"White Terror\\" in which many thousands of people were imprisoned or executed for their political opposition to the Kuomintang. Many victims of the white terror were Taiwanese elite‚Äîpolitical leaders, wealthier families, intellectuals, etc. In addition, mainlanders were not spared either, as many had real or perceived associations with communists before they came to Taiwan. For example, some mainlanders who had joined book clubs in mainland China, deemed leftist by the government, were liable to be arrested and many served long prison sentences for these real or perceived threats. Martial law, among other things, included sedition laws against supporters of communism or Taiwanese independence, leading to very substantial political repression. It also prohibited the formation of new parties (though opposition figures could run as independents or tangwai). Second, because of the ROC's claim to rule all of China, the vast majority of the seats in the Legislative Yuan (parliament) and National Assembly (electoral college for the president, now abolished) were held by those elected from mainland China constituencies in 1947 and 1948. The regime argued that these legislators should keep their seats until elections in their original constituencies were possible. Although supplemental elections that increased the ethnically Taiwanese representation in these bodies were held starting in 1969, the huge majorities of senior legislators continued through 1990, guaranteeing KMT control whether or not the party won on election day. More informally, the long-term residents of Taiwan prior to the late 1940s remained distinctly under-represented in the top ranks of governmenthttp://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan- website/5-gp/history/tw08.html \\"With regard to politics, Chen worked under the assumption that the Taiwanese people had been enslaved by the Japanese and actively promoted a campaign to re-Sinicize (ÂÜç‰∏≠ÂúãÂåñ) them, ignoring their strong desire to participate in the island‚Äôs politics after the ending of colonial rule. Thus, with the exception of one ‚Äúhalf-mainlander‚Äù deputy director appointed to the Education Department, almost all of the higher positions were held by the mainlanders. Furthermore, although the speaker of the Taiwan Provincial Assembly only had the right of consultation, Chen Yi still chose his favorite confidant, another ‚Äúhalf-mainlander‚Äù named Huang Chao-cin (ÈªÉÊúùÁê¥), to hold this post, instead of Lin Sian-tang (ÊûóÁçªÂ†Ç), a Taiwanese leader who had long enjoyed public support. As mainlanders took most of the higher positions within the government hierarchy while Taiwanese could only serve at low-level ones, the provincial governor was viewed as a new version of the Japanese governor (Êó•Êú¨Á∏ΩÁù£), and Taiwan‚Äôs return to the ROC was viewed as merely a ‚Äúchange of bosses‚Äù (ÊèõËÄÅÈóÜ).\\"http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/history/tw08.html \\"In 1946, one year after the Japanese surrender, the TPGO abolished Japanese editions of newspapers, forbade the use of the Japanese language in both writing and speech, and began to use proficiency in Chinese as an important consideration when recruiting people for government jobs. Taiwanese intellectuals suddenly became semi-literate, therefore, and most were excluded from the civil service, which added to people‚Äôs feelings of resentment.\\"http://www.gio.gov.tw/taiwan-website/5-gp/history/tw10.html \\"With successful formation of the DPP on 28 September 1986, the supplementary election of central public representatives held that year marked the true beginnings of party politics and a competing two-party democracy in Taiwan. In addition, the Nationalist government was accelerating the process of localization, with the number of Taiwanese taking important government posts slowly increasing to better reflect the general demographic structure of the island.\\" and the party through the early 1990s, suggesting a significant limit to democratization. =Economic developments= Partially with the help of the China Aid Act of 1948 and the Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction, the Republic of China government implemented a far-reaching and highly successful land reform program on Taiwan during the 1950s. They redistributed land among small farmers and compensated large landowners with commodities certificates and stock in state-owned industries. These rural reforms, such as the 375 rent reduction program, were never implemented with much force in mainland China but were very successful in Taiwan. Overall, although the reforms left some large landowners impoverished, others turned their compensation into capital and started commercial and industrial enterprises. These entrepreneurs were to become Taiwan's first industrial capitalists. Together with refugee businessmen from mainland China, they managed Taiwan's transition from an agricultural to a commercial, industrial economy. Taiwan's phenomenal economic development earned it a spot as one of the four Four Asian Tigers, along with Hong Kong, Singapore and South Korea, though as of late, much work remains in the ongoing process of privatization of state-owned industries and in financial sector reforms. =Diplomatic setbacks= 1960s ROC slogan: \\"The times test the youth. The youth create the times.\\" The 1970s saw many switches in diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China to the People's Republic of China. After World War II, the Republic of China had been one of the founding members in the United Nations and held China's seat on the Security Council until 1971, when it was expelled by General Assembly Resolution 2758 and replaced in all UN organs with the People's Republic of China government. (Multiple attempts by the Republic of China to re-join the UN have not made it past committee. See China and the United Nations.) Since the 1980s, the number of nations officially recognizing the Republic of China has decreased to 19. The People's Republic of China refuses to maintain diplomatic relations with any government which formally recognizes the Republic of China, leading to a complex political status of Taiwan (see also one China policy and foreign relations of the Republic of China). United States troops were stationed in Taiwan after the victory of the Communists in mainland China in order to aid in the defense of Taiwan against invasion by the People's Republic of China. The United States military continued to be stationed in Taiwan until diplomatic relations were broken with the Republic of China in 1979 but to this day maintains a significant intelligence presence. =Democratic reforms= The Republic of China entered into the development phase of constitutional democracy with the promulgation of the Constitution of the Republic of China in 1947. Subsequently, the National Revolutionary Army was also renamed as Republic of China Armed Forces and was nationalized. However, due to the Chinese Civil War, the Temporary Provisions Effective During the Period of Communist Rebellion was passed as amendment to the Constitution of the Republic of China. This established martial law in Taiwan and curtailed civil liberties and democracy. The official rationale for the Provisions was the ongoing Chinese Civil War and ROC was effectively under the military rule of the KMT during the period of mobilization. However, with the demise of the Kuomintang one-party system and democratization movement during the 1980s, the martial law was eventually lifted in 1987 and provisions were eventually rescinded in 1991. Constitutional democracy was eventually restored in ROC after 1987. When the Republic of China relocated to Taiwan in 1949, besides Kuomintang, the Chinese Youth Party (‰∏≠ÂúãÈùíÂπ¥Èª®) and Chinese Democratic Social Party (‰∏≠ÂúãÊ∞ë‰∏ªÁ§æÊúÉÈª®) were the only legal political parties in Taiwan. The other established parties operated under the Tangwai movement. Even though Chiang Kai-shek operated an autocratic government: as part of securing Taiwan, he also slowly began democratization progress in Taiwan, beginning with the elections of local offices. He also reformed the top Kuomintang leadership, transforming the party from a democratic centralist organization to one with many factions, each with differing opinions. Chiang Ching-kuo, succeeding his father Chiang Kai-shek, accelerated to liberalize the political system in Taiwan. Events such as the Kaohsiung Incident in 1979 highlighted the need for change and groups like Amnesty International were mobilizing a campaign against the government and President Chiang Ching-kuo. Chiang Ching-kuo, although a mainlander, pronounced that he was also a Taiwanese and also introduced many native-born Taiwanese people into top echelons of the party. He also named Lee Teng-hui, a native-born Taiwanese, as his vice president and likely successor. In 1986, the permission to form new political parties was granted, and the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) was inaugurated as the first opposition party. However, a political crisis appeared imminent as the Ministry of Justice filed charges against the DPP for violating martial law restrictions, but President Chiang defused it by announcing that martial law would end and that new political parties could be formed as long as they supported the Republican Constitution and renounced both communism and Taiwan Independence. The lifting of Martial Law Decree and the ban on veterans to visit their mainland China relatives was approved in 1987; the removal of the ban on registration of new newspapers in 1988 was also a historical event. After the 1988 death of Chiang Ching-kuo, his successor Lee Teng-hui continued to hand more government authority over to the ethnically Taiwanese and to democratize the government. In 1990, Lee held the National Affairs Conference which led to the abolishment of the national emergency period the following year and paved the way for both the total re-election for the National Assembly in 1991 and the Legislative Yuan in 1992. Full democracy in the sense that citizens are able to select their legislators, not just local officials, in free and fair elections was achieved in 1991 when the senior legislators were forced to retire. In 1994, again under the urging of President Lee, the presidency of the Republic of China was changed via constitutional revision into a position popularly elected by the people within the Free area of the Republic of China. Under Lee, Taiwan underwent a process of localization in which local culture and history was promoted over a pan-China viewpoint. Lee's reforms included printing banknotes from the Central Bank rather than the Provincial Bank of Taiwan and \\"freezing\\" the Taiwan Provincial Government (i.e., stripping the provincial government of much of its powers and merging those powers into either the central government's powers or local governments' powers without abolishing the provincial government altogether). Restrictions on the use of Hokkien in the broadcast media and in schools were lifted as well. However, democratization had its problems. During the early stages of the process, political parties were still banned, but independent candidates, some including those who had splintered off from the Kuomintang, were allowed to run for offices, provided that they would not receive any campaign funding from the party. As a result, many of these candidates resorted to borrowing money from businessmen, local elite, or even gangsters, in exchange for political and economic favors. This was the beginning of the \\"black gold\\" phenomena in Taiwan in which dishonest politicians were backed by businessmen and criminal elements at the expense of the society. In opposition to this, some former Kuomintang members formed the New Party to combat the Kuomintang, which had liberalized but had also introduced widespread corruption. Another stage was reached when the first direct elections for the powerful president were held in 1996. Lee ran as the incumbent in the ROC's first direct presidential election against DPP candidate and former dissident, Peng Ming- min, which prompted the People's Republic of China to conduct a series of missile tests in the Taiwan Strait to intimidate the ROC electorate. The aggressive tactic prompted United States President Bill Clinton to invoke the Taiwan Relations Act and dispatch an aircraft carrier into the region off Taiwan's southern coast to monitor the situation. =Political transition= The Presidential Building in Taipei The 2000 presidential election marked the end of the Kuomintang's status as the ruling party. Opposition DPP candidate Chen Shui-bian won a three-way race that saw the Pan-Blue vote split by independent James Soong (formerly of the Kuomintang) and Kuomintang candidate Lien Chan. Chan garnered 39% of the vote. After the election, Soong formed the People First Party (PFP). Chen Shui-bian was re-elected by a narrow 0.2% of the vote the 2004 presidential election over Kuomintang Chairman Lien, who had PFP Chairman Soong as his running mate. On the day before the election, both Chen and Vice President Annette Lu were shot while campaigning in Tainan. Their injuries were not life-threatening, but the incident is believed by Pan- Blue to have gained them enough sympathy to influence the result. That incident might also have given president Chen the ability of declaring martial emergency, which allegedly prevented the police and military, which were strongly Pan-Blue, from voting. Lien refused to concede, alleging voting irregularities. Kuomintang and PFP supporters held mass protests throughout the following weeks. Subsequently, Kuomintang and PFP took the case to the court. The High Court ordered a recount and found no evidence to support the accusation made by Kuomintang and PFP. The Court decided that the election result was legitimate and valid. During the legislative elections held on 8 December 2004, the Kuomintang-PFP dominated Pan-Blue alliance gained a slim majority in the elections which resulted in President Chen resigning as DPP chairman. The cabinet of Premier Yu Shyi-kun resigned, and Frank Hsieh assumed premiership on 25 January 2005. In a move that some saw as a reaction to Chen's re-election, the People's Republic of China enacted a proposed anti- secession law that allows the use of force on Taiwan and the Republic of China government if it formally declares independence. However, this law was met with overwhelming protest from nearly all political parties and public figures of the Republic of China and disapproval from the western countries. Negotiations in January in Macau between the aviation authorities from both the Republic of China and People's Republic of China resulted in direct-cross strait charter flights between mainland China and Taiwan during the Lunar New Year Period. In 2005, President Chen and PFP Chairman Soong held a summit and the independence-leaning president indicated that eventual reunification with mainland China would be an option. Against the anti-secession law proposed by the People's Republic of China, President Chen held a video conference with the European Parliament in Brussels urging the European Union not to lift the arms embargo on the People's Republic of China. During most of Chen's second term, Kuomintang and PFP together hold a pan-Blue majority in the legislature. Among the many items that have made little progress due to the political stalemate are a stalled arms procurement bill, which would advance defense capabilities of the Republic of China through the purchase of weaponry, such as sub-hunting P-3 Orions, from the US government, and banking reform legislation, which would help in the consolidation of the many banks in the Republic of China, none of which hold even 10% shares of the local market. It is important to note that the president of the Republic of China, unlike the president of the United States, does not wield veto power, providing him with little to no leverage in negotiating with an opposition legislature, regardless of how slim the majority. The constitution was further amended in 2005, creating a two-vote electoral system, with single member plurality seats and proportional representative seats, and abolishing the National Assembly, transferring most of its former powers to the Legislative Yuan, and leaving further amendment voting to public referendums. The issue of formally declaring the independence of Taiwan is also a constant constitutional question. Arms purchases from the United States are still a controversial political question, with the Pan-Green Coalition camp favoring the purchase, and the Pan-Blue Coalition opposing it. Recent allegations about corruption inside the First Family had led to three recall motions votes in the Legislative Yuan aimed at ousting President Chen Shui-bian. All of them had failed, because legislators voted according to political lines and the Pan- Blue Coalition lacked the two-thirds majority required to complete the process. The First Lady, Wu Shu-chen, was prosecuted for corruption, namely illegally using state funds for personal purposes. The president faced similar accusations as his wife, but was protected from prosecution by presidential immunity. He had promised to resign if his wife was found guilty. However, after his wife fainted in the preparation hearing, she had sought and obtained absence of leave from the Court 16 times citing health concerns before the end of Chen's term.Former first lady Wu to appear in court, \\"China Post\\" In December 2006, municipal and mayoral elections were held in Taipei City and Kaohsiung City. The KMT retained a majority in Taipei, while the DPP and the KMT obtained very close results in Kaohsiung. Huang Chun-ying lost to Chen Chu by a margin of 0.14 percent, making Chen Chu the first female mayor of a special municipality in the Republic of China. In 2007, the ROC applied for membership in the United Nations under the name \\"Taiwan\\", and is rejected by the General Assembly. In the 2008 presidential election, KMT candidate Ma Ying-jeou defeated DPP candidate Frank Hsieh with 58.48% of the vote. Ma ran on a platform supporting friendlier relations with mainland China and economic reforms. He was re-elected in 2012 with 51% of the vote, against 46.3% for DPP's Tsai Ing-wen and 2.7% for PFP's James Soong. In 2016 election, DPP candidate Tsai Ing-wen defeated KMT candidate Eric Chu, and became the first female president of Republic of China.

The newspaper provides daily coverage of local, international, financial, real-estate, entertainment, and sports news. Information on horse racing, soccer gambling, fashion trends and travel are also provided. The Oriental Daily is credited for a couple of breakthroughs. In 1977, it was the first local paper to launch a complaint page. These complaints could be against both public agencies (including governmental departments) and private companies. Readers can phone, fax or even complain through the internet using realtime conference system. If the reporters find the complaints interesting, they investigate and report them, acting as a sort of ombudsman for their readers. This has contributed to local newspaper's role as an influential channel for citizens to express their ideas and articulate their antipathy. The complaint page also reports on the response from the target of the complaints. It thus tries to stay neutral and fair, aiming only to arouse public awareness on the issues. Facing keen competition, Oriental Daily tries hard to keep up with the city's pace. For instance, new columns like 'new arrivals' postbox' were set up to accommodate the needs of mainland readers. A new soccer gambling page was also launched, with information on current odds. Its editorial is one of a kind. It has two editorials every day. The first one is called the 'Main Editorial' (Ê≠£Ë´ñ), which is styled like a typical newspaper editorial. The second one is called 'Kung Fu Tea' (ÂäüÂ§´Ëå∂), which is written in the vernacular form of Cantonese, and is a daily critique of the misfits of the bureaucracy, reflecting the concerns of Hong Kong's grassroots population. Internet service Oriental Daily, like many newspapers, has its own website. It provides readers free access to full version, up-to-date news. However, it only covers news of the day but not past issues. On.cc is the flagship website of the Oriental Press Group Limited. It was started in February 2002, and includes e-paper versions of Oriental Daily and Sun Daily. The whole printed version is uploaded onto the web allowing people from all over the world to read. This helps promote online newspaper viewing. However, one point to note is that readers have to register and pay to subscribe to the e-papers. This is 'personal information as commodity', as readers need to provide personal information. Competition and new developments Apple Daily, established in 1995, is the paper's main competitor. The two entered into a price war in December 1995. When Apple Daily reduced its price to HK$4, Oriental Daily responded by dropping its price to $2, in an effort to retain market share. During and after this war, six newspapers closed down due to persistent losses, driving out competitors such as Hong Kong Daily News, Sing Pao Daily News and Tin Tin News. The competition has led to changes in the paper's presentation, with more use of colour photos and illustrations. Competition also improved service quality, such as the introduction of customer service centres. Readers can report their complaints by visiting these centres in Tsim Sha Tsui and Wan Chai. Inside the centre, complaints can be lodged face-to-face to reporters via a digital video conversation system. Recently, Oriental Press Group Limited would like to extend its business to America and Canada. Cities like New York and Toronto which have high population of Chinese will be its first target.

Its name is Latin for 'eagle' and it represents the bird that carried Zeus/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greek-Roman mythology. Its brightest star, Altair, is one vertex of the Summer Triangle asterism. The constellation is best seen in the northern summer, as it is located along the Milky Way. Because of this location, many clusters and nebulae are found within its borders, but they are dim and galaxies are few. History The constellation Aquila as it can be seen by the naked eye. Aquila was one of the 48 constellations described by the second-century astronomer Ptolemy. It had been earlier mentioned by Eudoxus in the fourth century BC and Aratus in the third century BC. It is now one of the 88 constellations defined by the International Astronomical Union. The constellation was also known as Vultur volans (the flying vulture) to the Romans, not to be confused with Vultur cadens which was their name for Lyra. It is often held to represent the eagle which held Zeus's/Jupiter's thunderbolts in Greco-Roman mythology. Aquila is also associated with the eagle that kidnapped Ganymede, a son of one of the kings of Troy (associated with Aquarius), to Mount Olympus to serve as cup-bearer to the gods. Ptolemy catalogued 19 stars jointly in this constellation and in the now obsolete constellation of Antinous, which was named in the reign of the emperor Hadrian (AD 117‚Äì138), but sometimes erroneously attributed to Tycho Brahe, who catalogued 12 stars in Aquila and seven in Antinous. Hevelius determined 23 stars in the first and 19 in the second. The Greek Aquila is probably based on the Babylonian constellation of the Eagle, but is sometimes mistakenly thought as a seagull which is located in the same area as the Greek constellation. Notable features =Stars= Aquila, which lies in the Milky Way, contains many rich starfields and has been the location of many novae. Animation fading-in of Aquila, Delphinus, Sagitta, and the summer Milky Way as seen in Dark-sky preserve Westhavelland*Œ± Aql (Altair) is the brightest star in this constellation and one of the closest naked-eye stars to Earth at a distance of 17 light-years. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase al-nasr al-tair, meaning \\"the flying eagle\\". Altair has a magnitude of 0.76. *Œ≤ Aql (Alshain) and the is a yellow-hued star of magnitude 3.7, 45 light-years from Earth. Its name comes from the Arabic phrase shahin-i tarazu, meaning \\"the balance\\"; this name referred to Altair, Alshain, and Tarazed. *Œ≥ Aql (Tarazed) is an orange-hued giant star of magnitude 2.7, 460 light-years from Earth. Its name, like that of Alshain, comes from the Arabic for \\"the balance\\". *Œ∂ Aql (Okab) is a blue- white-hued star of magnitude 3.0, 83 light-years from Earth. *Œ∑ Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 1200 light-years from Earth. Among the brightest Cepheid variable stars, it has a minimum magnitude of 4.4 and a maximum magnitude of 3.5 with a period of 7.2 days. *15 Aql is an optical double star. The primary is an orange-hued giant of magnitude 5.4, 325 light- years from Earth. The secondary is a purple-hued star of magnitude 7.0, 550 light-years from Earth. The pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes. *57 Aql is a binary star. The primary is a blue-hued star of magnitude 5.7 and the secondary is a white star of magnitude 6.5. The system is approximately 350 light-years from Earth; the pair is easily resolved in small amateur telescopes. *R Aql is a red-hued giant star 690 light-years from Earth. It is a Mira variable with a minimum magnitude of 12.0, a maximum magnitude of 6.0, and a period around 9 months. It has a diameter of 400 D‚òâ. *FF Aql is a yellow-white-hued supergiant star, 2500 light-years from Earth. It is a Cepheid variable star with a minimum magnitude of 5.7, a maximum magnitude of 5.2, and a period of 4.5 days. *œÅ Aql moved across the border into neighboring Delphinus in 1992. *V Aquilae is a typical Cool Carbon Star. It's one of the most red-colored examples of this sort of stars, observable through common amateur telescopes. =Novae= A bright nova was observed in Aquila in 1918 (Nova Aquilae 1918) and briefly shone brighter than Altair, the brightest star in Aquila. =Deep-sky objects= IRAS 19024+0044 is a protoplanetary nebula in Aquila. Three interesting planetary nebulae lie in Aquila: *NGC 6804 shows a small but bright ring. *NGC 6781 bears some resemblance with the Owl Nebula in Ursa Major. *NGC 6751, also known as the Glowing Eye, is a planetary nebula. More deep-sky objects: *NGC 6709 is a loose open cluster containing roughly 40 stars, which range in magnitude from 9 to 11. It is about 3000 light-years from Earth. It has an overall magnitude of 6.7 and is about 9100 light-years from Earth. NGC 6709 appears in a rich Milky Way star field and is classified as a Shapley class d and Trumpler class III 2 m cluster. These designations mean that it does not have many stars, is loose, does not show greater concentration at the center, and has a moderate range of star magnitudes. *NGC 6755 is an open cluster of 7.5 m; it is made up of about a dozen stars with magnitudes 12 through 13. *NGC 6760 is a globular cluster of 9.1 m. *NGC 6749 is an open cluster. *NGC 6778 is a planetary nebula. *NGC 6741 is a planetary nebula. *NGC 6772 is a planetary nebula. Aquila also holds some extragalactic objects. One of them is what may be the largest single mass concentration of galaxies in the Universe known, the Hercules‚ÄìCorona Borealis Great Wall. It was discovered in November 2013, and has the size of 10 billion light years. It is the biggest and the most massive structure in the Universe known. =Other= NASA's Pioneer 11 space probe, which flew by Jupiter and Saturn in the 1970s, is expected to pass near the star Lambda (Œª) Aquilae in about 4 million years. Illustrations In illustrations of Aquila that represent it as an eagle, a nearly straight line of three stars symbolizes part of the wings. The center and brightest of these three stars is Altair. Mythology Aquila, with the now-obsolete figure of Antinous, as depicted by Sidney Hall in Urania's Mirror, a set of constellation cards published in London around 1825. At left is Delphinus. According to Gavin White, the Babylonian Eagle carried the constellation called the Dead Man in its talons. The author also draws a comparison to the classical stories of Antinous and Ganymede. In classical Greek mythology, Aquila was identified as ŒëŒµœÑœåœÇ ŒîŒØŒ±œÇ (Aetos Dios), the eagle that carried the thunderbolts of Zeus and was sent by him to carry the shepherd boy Ganymede, whom he desired, to Mount Olympus; the constellation of Aquarius is sometimes identified with Ganymede. In the Chinese love story of Qi Xi, Niu Lang (Altair) and his two children (Œ≤ and Œ≥ Aquilae) are separated forever from their wife and mother Zhi Nu (Vega), who is on the far side of the river, the Milky Way. In Hinduism, the constellation Aquila is identified with the half- eagle half-human deity Garuda. In ancient Egypt, Aquila possibly was seen as the falcon of Horus. According to Berio, the identification of Aquila as an Egyptian constellation, and not merely Graeco-Babylonian, is corroborated by the Daressy Zodiac. It depicts an outer ring showing the Sphaera Graeca, the familiar Hellenistic zodiac, while the middle ring depicts the Sphaera Barbarica or foreigner's zodiac with the zodiacal signs of the Egyptian dodekaoros which were also recorded by Teucros of Babylon. Under the sign of Sagittarius is the falcon of Horus, presumably because Aquila rises with Sagittarius. Equivalents In Chinese astronomy, Œ∂ Aql is located within the Heavenly Market Enclosure (Â§©Â∏ÇÂû£, TiƒÅn Sh√¨ Yu√°n), and the other stars of the constellation are placed within the Black Tortoise of the North (ÂåóÊñπÁéÑÊ≠¶, Bƒõi FƒÅng Xu√°n W«î). Several different Polynesian equivalents to Aquila as a whole are known. On the island of Futuna, it was called Kau-amonga, meaning \\"Suspended Burden\\". Its name references the Futunan name for Orion's belt and sword, Amonga. In Hawaii, Altair was called Humu, translated to English as \\"to sew, to bind together parts of a fishhook.\\" \\"Humu\\" also refers to the hole by which parts of a hook are bound together.NƒÅ Puke Wehewehe  ª≈ålelo Hawai ªi Humu- ma was said to influence the astrologers. Pao-toa was the name for the entire constellation in the Marquesas Islands; the name meant \\"Fatigued Warrior\\". Also, Polynesian constellations incorporated the stars of modern Aquila. The Pukapuka constellation Tolu, meaning \\"three\\", was made up of Alpha, Beta, and Gamma Aquilae. Altair was commonly named among Polynesian peoples, as well. The people of Hawaii called it Humu, the people of the Tuamotus called it Tukituki (\\"Pound with a hammer\\") - they named Beta Aquilae Nga Tangata (\\"The Men\\") - and the people of Pukapuka called Altair Turu and used it as a navigational star. The MƒÅori people named Altair Poutu-te-rangi, \\"Pillar of the Sky\\", because of its important position in their cosmology. It was used differently in different MƒÅori calendars, being the star of February and March in one version and March and April in the other. Altair was also the star that ruled the annual sweet potato harvest.

Originally a Chinese military fort, the walled city became an enclave after the New Territories were leased to the UK by China in 1898. Its population increased dramatically following the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong during World War II. By 1990, the walled city contained 50,000 residents within its borders. From the 1950s to the 1970s, it was controlled by local triads and had high rates of prostitution, gambling, and drug abuse. In January 1987, the Hong Kong government announced plans to demolish the walled city. After an arduous eviction process, demolition began in March 1993 and was completed in April 1994. Kowloon Walled City Park opened in December 1995 and occupies the area of the former walled city. Some historical artefacts from the walled city, including its yamen building and remnants of its southern gate, have been preserved there. History =Military outpost= alt=The front entrance of a fort with mountains in the background. The history of the walled city can be traced back to the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279), when an outpost was set up to manage the trade of salt. Little took place for hundreds of years afterward, although 30 guards were stationed there in 1668. A small coastal fort was established around 1810 after Chinese forces abandoned Tung Lung Fort. In 1842, during Qing Emperor Daoguang's reign, Hong Kong Island was ceded to Britain by the Treaty of Nanjing. As a result, the Qing authorities felt it necessary to improve the fort in order to rule the area and check further British influence. The improvements, including the formidable defensive wall, were completed in 1847. The walled city was captured by rebels during the Taiping Rebellion in 1854 before being retaken a few weeks later.Li Long Lam, Excavation Report of Kowloon Walled City, Hong Kong(È¶ôÊ∏Ø‰πùÈæôÂØ®ÂüéÂèëÊéòÁÆÄÊä•)\\", in Kaogu, vol. 6, 2007. The present walled city's \\"Dapeng Association House\\" forms the remnants of what was previously Lai Enjue's garrison. 1915 map of the Hong Kong region with the Kowloon Walled City listed as \\"Chinese Town\\" at the upper right-hand corner The Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory of 1898 handed additional parts of Hong Kong (the New Territories) to Britain for 99 years, but excluded the walled city, which at the time had a population of roughly 700. China was allowed to continue to keep officials there as long as they did not interfere with the defence of British Hong Kong. The following year, the governor, Sir Henry Blake, suspected that the viceroy of Canton was using troops to aid resistance to the new arrangements. On 14 April 1899, British forces attacked the walled city, only to find the viceroy's soldiers gone, leaving behind only the mandarin and 150 residents. The Qing dynasty ended its rule in 1912, leaving the walled city to the British. Though the British claimed ownership of the walled city, they did little with it over the following few decades. The Protestant church established an old people's home in the old \\"yamen\\" (Chinese administrative office) as well as a school and an almshouse in other former offices. Aside from such institutions, however, the walled city became a mere curiosity for British colonials and tourists to visit; it was labelled as \\"Chinese Town\\" in a 1915 map. In 1933, the Hong Kong authorities announced plans to demolish most of the decaying walled city's buildings, compensating the 436 squatters that lived there with new homes. That same year in 1933, the Nationalist Chinese government claimed jurisdiction over the city. By 1940 only the yamen, the school and one house remained. During the World War II occupation of Hong Kong, the Japanese occupying forces demolished the city's wall and used the stone to expand the nearby Kai Tak Airport. =Urban settlement= An aerial view of Kowloon Walled City and the neighbouring Sai Tau Tsuen village in 1972 After Japan's surrender in 1945, China announced its intent to reclaim the walled city. Refugees fleeing the Chinese Civil War post-1945 poured into Hong Kong, and 2,000 squatters occupied the walled city by 1947. After a failed attempt to drive them out in 1948, the British adopted a 'hands-off' policy in most matters concerning the walled city. The south side of the Kowloon Walled City in 1975. The elevation of the buildings begins to reach its maximum height. In January 1950, a fire broke out that destroyed over 2,500 huts, home to nearly 3,500 families and 17,000 total people. The disaster highlighted the need for proper fire prevention in the largely wooden-built squatter areas, complicated by the lack of political ties with the colonial and Chinese governments. The ruins gave new arrivals to the walled city the opportunity to build anew, causing speculation that the fire may have been intentionally set. With no government enforcement from the Chinese or the British aside from a few raids by the Royal Hong Kong Police, the walled city became a haven for crime and drugs. It was only during a 1959 trial for a murder that occurred within the walled city that the Hong Kong government was ruled to have jurisdiction there. By that time, however, the walled city was virtually ruled by the organised crime syndicates known as triads. Beginning in the 1950s, triad groups such as the 14K and Sun Yee On gained a stranglehold on the walled city's numerous brothels, gaming parlours, and opium dens. The walled city had become such a haven for criminals that police would venture into it only in large groups. It was not until 1973 and 1974, when a series of more than 3,500 police raids resulted in over 2,500 arrests and over of seized drugs, that the triads' power began to wane. With public support, particularly from younger residents, the continued raids gradually eroded drug use and violent crime. In 1983, the district police commander declared the walled city's crime rate to be under control. One of the outer edges in 1991 The city also underwent massive construction during the 1960s, with developers building new modular structures above older ones. The city became extremely densely populated and \\"a world unto its own,\\" an enclave, with over 33,000 people in 300 buildings occupying little more than . As a result, the city reached its maximum size by the late 1970s and early 1980s; a height restriction of 13 to 14 storeys had been imposed on the city due to the flight path of planes heading toward Kai Tak Airport. As well as limiting building height, the proximity of the airport subjected residents to serious noise pollution. Eight municipal pipes provided water to the entire structure, although more could have come from wells. A few of the streets were illuminated by fluorescent lights, as sunlight rarely reached the lower levels due to the outstanding disregard to air rights within the city. Although the rampant crime of earlier decades diminished in later years, the walled city was still known for its high number of unlicenced doctors and dentists who could operate there without threat of prosecution. Although the walled city was for many years a hotbed of criminal activity, most residents were not involved in any crime and lived peacefully within its walls. Numerous small factories and businesses thrived inside the walled city, and some residents formed groups to organise and improve daily life there. An attempt by the government in 1963 to demolish some shacks in a corner of the city gave rise to an \\"anti-demolition committee\\" that served as the basis for a kaifong association. Charities, religious societies, and other welfare groups were gradually introduced to the city. While medical clinics and schools went unregulated, the Hong Kong government provided some services such as water supply and mail delivery. =Eviction and demolition= An alley in the city The quality of life in the city‚Äîsanitary conditions in particular‚Äîremained far behind the rest of Hong Kong. The Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984 laid the groundwork for the city's demolition. The mutual decision by the two governments to tear down the walled city was announced on 14 January 1987. On 10 March 1987, following the announcement that the walled city would be converted to a park, the Secretary for District Administration formally requested the Urban Council agree to take over the site following demolition. Owing to the presence of numerous other green spaces in the area, the Urban Services Department doubted the need for \\"yet another park\\" from a planning and operations point of view, but the council agreed nonetheless to accept the government's proposal on the condition that the government bear the cost of park construction. The government distributed some () in compensation to the estimated 33,000 residents and businesses in a plan devised by a special committee of the Hong Kong Housing Authority. Some residents were not satisfied with the compensation and were forcibly evicted between November 1991 and July 1992. While it was deserted, the empty city was used to film a scene in the 1993 movie Crime Story. After four months of planning, demolition of the walled city began on 23 March 1993 and concluded in April 1994. Construction work on Kowloon Walled City Park started the following month. Current status as park alt=A pagoda on a pond with a waterfall. The area where the walled city once stood is now Kowloon Walled City Park, adjacent to Carpenter Road Park. The park was completed in August 1995 and handed over to the Urban Council. It was opened officially by Governor Chris Patten a few months later on 22 December. Construction of the park cost a total of . The park's design is modelled on Jiangnan gardens of the early Qing Dynasty. It is divided into eight landscape features, with the fully restored yamen as its centrepiece. The park's paths and pavilions are named after streets and buildings in the walled city. Artefacts from the walled city, such as five inscribed stones and three old wells, are also on display in the park. The park was designed by the Architectural Services Department, which won a \\"prestigious award\\" from the Central Society of Horticulture of Germany for the redevelopment. alt=On a green lawn surrounded by a brick wall lie broken engraved stones and stone foundations. Components of the park include: * The Eight Floral Walks, each named after a different plant or flower * The Chess Garden, featuring four Chinese chessboards * The Garden of Chinese zodiac, containing stone statues of the 12 Chinese zodiac animals * The Garden of Four Seasons (named Guangyin Square after the small open area in the walled city), a garden with plants that symbolise the four seasons * The Six Arts Terrace, a wedding area containing a garden and the Bamboo Pavilion * The Kuixing Pavilion, including a moon gate framed by two stone tablets and the towering Guibi Rock, which represents Hong Kong's return to China * The Mountain View Pavilion, a two- storey structure resembling a docked boat that provides a good view of the entire park * The Lung Tsun, Yuk Tong, and Lung Nam Pavilions * The yamen and the remains of the South Gate (see below). =Declared monuments= alt=The front entrance of a building labelled \\"Almshouse\\" with a cannon in front of it. Children of early 20th century Kowloon Walled City residents playing on the yamen cannons The Antiquities and Monuments Office conducted archaeological examinations as the walled city was being demolished, and several cultural remains were discovered. Among them were the walled city's yamen and remnants of its South Gate, which were officially designated declared monuments of Hong Kong on 4 October 1996. The South Gate had originally served as the walled city's main entrance. Along with its foundation, other remains included two stone plaques inscribed with \\"South Gate\\" and \\"Kowloon Walled City\\" from the South Gate and a flagstone path that had led up to it. The foundations of the city's wall and East Gate were also discovered. The Hong Kong government preserved the South Gate remnants next to a square in front of the yamen. The yamen building is made up of three halls. Originally the middle hall served the Assistant Magistrate of Kowloon's administrative office, and the rear block was his residence. After the government officials left the area in 1899, it was used for several other purposes, including an old people's home, a refuge for widows and orphans, a school, and a clinic. It was restored in 1996 and is now found near the centre of the park. It contains a photo gallery of the walled city, and two cannon dating back to 1802 sit at the sides of its entrance. Layout and architecture Model of Kowloon Walled City located at the entrance of Kowloon Walled City Park The walled city was located in what became known as the Kowloon City area of Kowloon. In spite of its transformation from a fort into an urban enclave, the walled city retained the same basic layout. The original fort was built on a slope and consisted of a plot measuring about . The stone wall surrounding it had four entrances and measured tall and thick before it was dismantled in 1943. The Kowloon Walled City in 1989. Construction surged dramatically during the 1960s and 1970s, until the formerly low-rise city consisted almost entirely of buildings with 10 storeys or more (with the notable exception of the yamen in its centre). However, due to the Kai Tak Airport's position south of the city, buildings did not exceed 14 storeys. The two-storey Sai Tau Tsuen settlement bordered the walled city to the south and west until it was cleared in 1985 and replaced with Carpenter Road Park. The city's dozens of alleyways were often only wide, and had poor lighting and drainage. An informal network of staircases and passageways also formed on upper levels, which was so extensive that one could travel north to south through the entire City without ever touching solid ground. Construction in the city went unregulated, and most of the roughly 350 buildings were built with poor foundations and few or no utilities. Because apartments were so small‚Äîa typical unit was ‚Äîspace was maximised with wider upper floors, caged balconies and rooftop additions. Roofs in the city were full of television antennae, clothes lines, water tanks and rubbish, and could be crossed using a series of ladders. Population A street at the edge of the city at night in 1993. Kowloon Walled City's early population fluctuated between zero and a few hundred, and began growing steadily shortly after World War II. However, there is no accurate population information available for much of the walled city's later existence. Official census numbers estimated the walled city's population at 10,004 in 1971 and 14,617 in 1981, but these figures were commonly considered to be much too low. Informal estimates, on the other hand, often mistakenly included the neighbouring squatter village of Sai Tau Tsuen. Population figures of about 50,000 were also reported. A thorough government survey in 1987 gave a clearer picture: an estimated 33,000 people resided within the walled city. Based on this survey, the walled city had a population density of approximately in 1987, making it the most densely populated spot in the world. Culture alt=A close-up the walled city's mass of tall buildings. A playground at the edge of the city. In response to difficult living conditions, residents formed a tightly knit community, helping one another endure various hardships. Within families, wives often did housekeeping, while grandmothers cared for their grandchildren and other children from surrounding households. The city's rooftops were important gathering places, especially for residents who lived on upper floors. Parents used them to relax, and children would play or do homework there after school. The yamen in the heart of the city was also a major social centre, a place for residents to talk, have tea or watch television, and to take classes such as calligraphy. The Old People's Centre also held religious meetings for Christians and others. Other religious institutions included the Fuk Tak and Tin Hau temples, which were used for a combination of Buddhist, Taoist, and animist practices. = Cultural memory = The cultural legacy left behind by the walled city was one of crime and corruption. Administration was largely absent due to the political boundaries in which the city existed. The widespread criminal activity in the city did not apply exclusively to triads alone; police would also conspire with the triads to profit from the illicit trades happening within the city. Both police and residents spoke of the endemic corruption that was rife within the city. This was largely due to the fact that the city was left to its own devices, the proximity and spatial tightness allowing a very close community to form, in which its own culture developed. A form of \\"anarchic urbanism\\" formed due to the circumstances in which the community experienced and it through the uncertainty of its existence between governance in which its identity is formed. This is largely due to the fact that the city was isolated both physically and psychologically from Hong Kong itself, producing a unique culture that only existed within the city. As Kowloon Walled City fades further away from relevancy the cultural memory of the space has become more sanitized, with crime and corruption in the background. This allowed the Kowloon Walled City to experience a 'second life' in which many popular media and game outlets portray the city in a more nostalgic and romanticized version. The Kowloon Walled City's second life and re-emergence in the public consciousness can be attributed to the handover in 1997 where the imminence of its disappearance caused a rise in interest in Hong Kong culture. The city was also a spot that highlighted \\"guerrilla capitalism\\" which showed the city's ability to adapt to the conditions of the time, but it is also remembered as an era that cannot return. This is in-line with the city's reputation, from being shunned in its existence in the early years to now being a point of pride for many Hong Kong residences alike. It is only in the modern era where the Kowloon Walled City is often portrayed with a romantic dystopian identity where many forms of media borrow the city's culture in their own works. Depictions and legacy =Memoirs and autobiographies= A few of the people who spent time in Kowloon Walled City have written accounts of their experiences. Evangelist Jackie Pullinger wrote a 1989 memoir, Crack in the Wall, about her involvement in treating drug addicts within the walled city. In his 2004 autobiography Gweilo, Martin Booth describes his exploration of the walled city as a child in the 1950s. Gordon Jones, a District Officer of Kowloon City District at the time also published his recollections of the city during his time in office. =Works specifically documenting the walled city= Books and research papers * City of Darkness: Life in Kowloon Walled City, by Ian Lambot (writer, photographer) and Greg Girard (photographer), published by Wilhelm Ernst & Sohn, 1993, and Watermark, 1999, * City of Darkness: Revisited, by Ian Lambot (writer, photographer) and Greg Girard (photographer), published by Watermark, 2014, (revised edition of City of Darkness) * , by Ian Lambot (writer, photographer) and Greg Girard (photographer), published by EastPress, 2004, (Japanese edition of City of Darkness) * , by the Ky≈´ry≈´j≈ç Tankentai (the \\"Kowloon Walled City Exploration Team\\"), including Hitomi Terasawa (illustrator), Takayuki Suzuki (architect) and Hiroaki Kani (supervisor), published by Iwanami Shoten, 1997, * , by Ry≈´ji Miyamoto (photographer), Hiroshi Aramata (text contributor) and Ken'ichi ≈åhashi (text contributor), published by Heibonsha, 1997, ; Heibonsha, 1998, ; Heibonsha, 1999, * , by Shintar≈ç Nakamura, published by Shinpusha, 1996, * An Architectural Study on the Kowloon Walled City: Preliminary Findings, by Suenn Ho, published by Columbia University, 1992 * Jiulong Cheng Zhai shihua (), by Lu Jinzhe, published by Joint Publishing, 1997, * , by Wong Kwan-yiu et al., published by the Chinese University of Hong Kong ‚Äì Department of Geography, 1992 * FARMAX: Excursions on Density, by Winy Maas, Jacob van Rijs and Richard Koek (main contributors), published by 010 Publishers, 1998, ; 010 Publishers, 2006, Documentary films * The Walled City (), as part of Hong Kong Connection's () 70th segment, produced by Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK), 1979 * Hongkongs geheime Stadt ‚Äì Ein Labyrinth f√ºr 50.000 Menschen (\\"Hong Kong's Secret City: A Labyrinth for 50,000 People\\"), produced by √ñsterreichischer Rundfunk (ORF), 1989 * Kowloon Walled City, as part of Whicker's World, produced by ITV Yorkshire, 1980 * City of Imagination: Kowloon Walled City 20 Years Later (archive footage by ORF and Suenn Ho), produced by The Wall Street Journal, 2014 =Appearance in creative works= Many authors, filmmakers, game designers, and visual artists have used the walled city to convey a sense of oppressive urbanisation or unfettered criminality. In literature, Robert Ludlum's novel The Bourne Supremacy uses the walled city as one of its settings. The City appears as a virtual reality environment (described by Steven Poole as an \\"oasis of political and creative freedom\\") in William Gibson's Bridge trilogy, and as a contrast with Singapore in his Wired article \\"Disneyland with the Death Penalty\\". In the manga Crying Freeman, the titular character's wife travels to the walled city to master her swordsmanship and control a cursed sword. The manga Blood+: Kowloon Nights uses the walled city as the setting for a series of murders. The walled city finds an extensive mention in Doctor Robin Cook's 1991 novel Vital Signs. The filth, squalor and the crime-oriented nature of the area is described vividly when the characters Marissa and Tristan Williams pass by the back-lanes. The later part of episode 3 and episode 4 of the anime Street Fighter II V are set in the Kowloon Walled City, depicted as a dark and lawless area where Ryu, Ken and Chun-Li have to fight for their lives at every turn, being rescued by the police once they reach the walled city's limits. The 1982 Shaw Brothers film Brothers from the Walled City is set in Kowloon Walled City. The 1984 gangster film Long Arm of the Law features the walled city as a refuge for gang members before they are gunned down by police. In the 1988 film Bloodsport, starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, the walled city is the setting for a martial arts tournament. The 1992 non-narrative film Baraka features several highly detailed shots of the walled city shortly before its demolition. The 1993 film Crime Story starring Jackie Chan was partly filmed in the deserted walled city, and includes real scenes of building explosions. A walled neighbourhood called the Narrows in the 2005 film Batman Begins was inspired by the walled city. The 2006 Hong Kong horror film Re-cycle features a decrepit, nightmarish version of the walled city, complete with tortured souls from which the protagonist must flee. The 2016 TVB martial arts drama A Fist Within Four Walls takes place in the triad- ridden walled city in the early 1960s. Kawasaki Warehouse, a former Japanese game arcade with a Kowloon Walled City theme Kowloon Walled City is depicted in several games, including Kowloon's Gate and Shenmue II. The game Stranglehold, a sequel to the film Hard Boiled, features a version of the walled city filled with hundreds of Triad members. In the games Fear Effect and Fear Effect 2, photographs of the walled city were used as inspiration \\"for moods, camera angles and lighting.\\" Concept art for the MMORPG Guild Wars: Factions depicts massive, densely packed structures inspired by the walled city. The pen-and-paper RPG Shadowrun and CRPG Shadowrun: Hong Kong include a crime-ridden, rebuilt version of the Walled City set in 2056. The walled city also features in the 2010 game Call of Duty: Black Ops. A partial recreation of the Kowloon Walled City existed in the Warehouse Kawasaki, an amusement arcade that operated from 2009 to 2019 in the Japanese suburb of Kawasaki, Kanagawa. The atmosphere of the walled city was reflected in the arcade's narrow corridors, electrical wires, pipes, postboxes, sign boards, neon lights, frayed posters, and various other small touches.

Symptoms may include headache, dizziness, shortness of breath, nausea, poor muscle coordination, and blue-colored skin (cyanosis). Complications may include seizures and heart arrhythmias. Methemoglobinemia can be due to certain medications, chemicals, or food or it can be inherited from a person's parents. Substances involved may include benzocaine, nitrates, or dapsone. The underlying mechanism involves some of the iron in hemoglobin being converted from the ferrous [Fe2+] to the ferric [Fe3+] form. The diagnosis is often suspected based on symptoms and a low blood oxygen that does not improve with oxygen therapy. Diagnosis is confirmed by a blood gas. Treatment is generally with oxygen therapy and methylene blue. Other treatments may include vitamin C, exchange transfusion, and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Outcomes are generally good with treatment. Methemoglobinemia is relatively uncommon, with most cases being acquired rather than genetic. Signs and symptoms Chocolate-brown blood due to methemoglobinemia Signs and symptoms of methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level above 10%) include shortness of breath, cyanosis, mental status changes (~50%), headache, fatigue, exercise intolerance, dizziness, and loss of consciousness. People with severe methemoglobinemia (methemoglobin level above 50%) may exhibit seizures, coma, and death (level above 70%). Healthy people may not have many symptoms with methemoglobin levels below 15%. However, patients with co-morbidities such as anemia, cardiovascular disease, lung disease, sepsis, or presence of other abnormal hemoglobin species (e.g. carboxyhemoglobin, sulfhemoglobin or sickle hemoglobin) may experience moderate to severe symptoms at much lower levels (as low as 5‚Äì8%). Cause =Acquired= Methemoglobinemia may be acquired. Classical drug causes of methemoglobinaemia include various antibiotics (trimethoprim, sulfonamides, and dapsone), local anesthetics (especially articaine, benzocaine, prilocaine, and lidocaine), and aniline dyes, metoclopramide, rasburicase, chlorates, bromates, and nitrites . Nitrates are suspected to cause methemoglobinemia. In otherwise healthy individuals, the protective enzyme systems normally present in red blood cells rapidly reduce the methemoglobin back to hemoglobin and hence maintain methemoglobin levels at less than one percent of the total hemoglobin concentration. Exposure to exogenous oxidizing drugs and their metabolites (such as benzocaine, dapsone, and nitrates) may lead to an increase of up to a thousandfold of the methemoglobin formation rate, overwhelming the protective enzyme systems and acutely increasing methemoglobin levels. Infants under 6 months of age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin reduction enzyme (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase) in their red blood cells. This results in a major risk of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water, dehydration (usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea), sepsis, or topical anesthetics containing benzocaine or prilocaine. Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak into the ground and may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically set to protect infants. Benzocaine applied to the gums or throat (as commonly used in baby teething gels, or sore throat lozenges) can cause methemoglobinemia. =Genetic= The congenital form of methemoglobinemia has an autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance. Due to a deficiency of the enzyme diaphorase I (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase), methemoglobin levels rise and the blood of met-Hb patients has reduced oxygen-carrying capacity. Instead of being red in color, the arterial blood of met-Hb patients is brown. This results in the skin of Caucasian patients gaining a bluish hue. Hereditary met-Hb is caused by a recessive gene. If only one parent has this gene, offspring will have normal-hued skin, but if both parents carry the gene, there is a chance the offspring will have blue-hued skin. Another cause of congenital methemoglobinemia is seen in patients with abnormal hemoglobin variants such as hemoglobin M (HbM), or hemoglobin H (HbH), which are not amenable to reduction despite intact enzyme systems. Methemoglobinemia can also arise in patients with pyruvate kinase deficiency due to impaired production of NADH ‚Äì the essential cofactor for diaphorase I. Similarly, patients with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency may have impaired production of another co-factor, NADPH. Pathophysiology The affinity for oxygen of ferric iron is impaired. The binding of oxygen to methemoglobin results in an increased affinity for oxygen in the remaining heme sites that are in ferrous state within the same tetrameric hemoglobin unit. This leads to an overall reduced ability of the red blood cell to release oxygen to tissues, with the associated oxygen‚Äìhemoglobin dissociation curve therefore shifted to the left. When methemoglobin concentration is elevated in red blood cells, tissue hypoxia may occur. Normally, methemoglobin levels are <1%, as measured by the CO-oximetry test. Elevated levels of methemoglobin in the blood are caused when the mechanisms that defend against oxidative stress within the red blood cell are overwhelmed and the oxygen carrying ferrous ion (Fe2+) of the heme group of the hemoglobin molecule is oxidized to the ferric state (Fe3+). This converts hemoglobin to methemoglobin, resulting in a reduced ability to release oxygen to tissues and thereby hypoxia. This can give the blood a bluish or chocolate-brown color. Spontaneously formed methemoglobin is normally reduced (regenerating normal hemoglobin) by protective enzyme systems, e.g., NADH methemoglobin reductase (cytochrome-b5 reductase) (major pathway), NADPH methemoglobin reductase (minor pathway) and to a lesser extent the ascorbic acid and glutathione enzyme systems. Disruptions with these enzyme systems lead to methemoglobinemia. Hypoxia occurs due to the decreased oxygen-binding capacity of methemoglobin, as well as the increased oxygen- binding affinity of other subunits in the same hemoglobin molecule, which prevents them from releasing oxygen at normal tissue oxygen levels. Diagnosis Color chart for the detection of the amount of methemoglobin in the blood Arterial blood with elevated methemoglobin levels has a characteristic chocolate-brown color as compared to normal bright red oxygen- containing arterial blood. If methemoglobinemia is suspected, an arterial blood gas and CO-oximetry panel should be obtained. =Differential diagnosis= Other conditions that can cause bluish skin include argyria, sulfhemoglobinemia, and heart failure. Treatment Cyanosis from methemoglobinemia Resolved after methylene blue Methemoglobinemia can be treated with supplemental oxygen and methylene blue. Methylene blue is given as a 1% solution (10 mg/ml) 1 to 2 mg/kg administered intravenously slowly over five minutes. Although the response is usually rapid, the dose may be repeated in one hour if the level of methemoglobin is still high one hour after the initial infusion. Methylene blue inhibits monoamine oxidase, and serotonin toxicity can occur if taken with an SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) medicine. Methylene blue restores the iron in hemoglobin to its normal (reduced) oxygen-carrying state. This is achieved by providing an artificial electron acceptor (such as methylene blue or flavin) for NADPH methemoglobin reductase (RBCs usually don't have one; the presence of methylene blue allows the enzyme to function at 5√ó normal levels). The NADPH is generated via the hexose monophosphate shunt. Genetically induced chronic low-level methemoglobinemia may be treated with oral methylene blue daily. Also, vitamin C can occasionally reduce cyanosis associated with chronic methemoglobinemia, and may be helpful in settings in which methylene blue is unavailable or contraindicated (e.g., in an individual with G6PD deficiency).https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-diagnosis-and- treatment-of-methemoglobinemia Diaphorase (cytochrome b5 reductase) normally contributes only a small percentage of the red blood cell's reducing capacity, but can be pharmacologically activated by exogenous cofactors (such as methylene blue) to five times its normal level of activity. Epidemiology Methemoglobinemia mostly affects infants under 6 months of age (particularly those under 4 months) due to low hepatic production of methemoglobin reductase. The most at-risk populations are those with water sources high in nitrates, such as wells and other water that is not monitored or treated by a water treatment facility. The nitrates can be hazardous to the infants. The link between blue baby syndrome in infants and high nitrate levels is well established for waters exceeding the normal limit of 10 mg/L. However, there is also evidence that breastfeeding is protective in exposed populations. Society and culture = Blue Fugates = The Fugates, a family that lived in the hills of Kentucky, had the hereditary form. They are known as the \\"Blue Fugates\\". Martin Fugate and Elizabeth Smith, who had married and settled near Hazard, Kentucky in around 1800, were both carriers of the recessive methemoglobinemia (met-H) gene, as was a nearby clan with whom the Fugates descendants intermarried. As a result, many descendants of the Fugates were born with met-H.Straight Dope article on the Fugates of Appalachia, an extended family of blue-skinned peopleTri City Herald, November 7, 1974 p.32 Newspaper reports on the Blue FugatesFugates of Kentucky: Skin Bluer than Lake LouiseMartin Fuqatenin n…ôsli: genetik problem…ô g√∂r…ô d√ºnyaya g…ôl…ôn mavi u≈üaqlar ‚Äî Mavi Fuqatel…ôr = Blue Men of Lurgan = The \\"blue men of Lurgan\\" were a pair of Lurgan men suffering from what was described as \\"familial idiopathic methaemoglobinaemia\\" who were treated by Dr. James Deeny in 1942.

The Kowloon Peninsula is a peninsula that forms the southern part of the main landmass in the territory of Hong Kong, alongside Victoria Harbour and facing toward Hong Kong island. The Kowloon Peninsula and the area of New Kowloon are collectively known as Kowloon. Geographically, the term \\"Kowloon Peninsula\\" may also refer to the area south of the mountain ranges of Beacon Hill, Lion Rock, Tate's Cairn, Kowloon Peak, etc. The peninsula covers five of the eighteen districts of Hong Kong. Kowloon Bay is located at the northeast of the peninsula. Geology and reclamation The main rock type of the peninsula consists of a medium grained monzogranite with some fine granite outcrops, part of the Kowloon Granite.Geological Map, Sheet 11, Hong Kong and Kowloon (1:20,000), Hong Kong Geological Survey Early maps and photographs show flat, low-lying land behind the beach of Tsim Sha Tsui Bay with a raised area, Kowloon Hill, in the west.‚Äì Environmental Impact Assessment ‚Äì Land Contamination Assessment, 10.2.1 Geology Information The peninsula has been significantly expanded through land reclamation from the sea, over several phases. In the south and west most of the reclamation was carried out before 1904. Reclamation in several other small areas along the main Tsim Sha Tsui waterfront was completed by 1982. Since 1994, parts of the Hung Hom Bay were reclaimed and by 2019, it had been completely extinguished. The West Kowloon Reclamation was formed as part of the Airport Core Programme and largely completed by 1995. History Before the actual Kowloon boundaries were established, the Kowloon Peninsula served as one of the first destinations for escape during China's dynastic times. In 1287, the last emperor of the Song dynasty, Emperor Bing was fleeing from the Mongol leader Kublai Khan. Taking refuge in a cave in the Kowloon peninsula, the inscription wrote \\"Sung Wong Toi\\" or \\"Song Emperor's Pavilion\\".Warres, Smith D. [1990] (1990). European Settlements in the Far East: China, Japan, Indo-China, Straits Settlements, Malaysia. Stanford University Press. No ISBN Digitized In the 17th century, after the fall of the Ming dynasty, many of the Emperor's followers also found shelter in the Kowloon peninsula to hide from the Manchus. Historically speaking, Kowloon Peninsula refers to the ceded territories of Kowloon in 1860 as part of the Convention of Peking, but geographically it covers the entire Kowloon south of the mountain ranges of Lion Rock, Kowloon Peak and other hills. Kowloon Peninsula had a population of 800 when it was ceded to the British empire in 1860. In 1898 a resolution was passed by the Colonial Hong Kong Legislative Council to preserve the land where some of the caves stand.15TH AUGUST, 1898 An Air France Boeing 747 passing above Kowloon, landing at the old airport.

It was also a time of confrontation as the capitalist United States and its allies politically opposed the Soviet Union and other communist countries; the Cold War had begun. African Americans united and organized, and a triumph of the Civil Rights Movement ended Jim Crow segregation in the South.James T. Patterson, Grand Expectations: The United States, 1945‚Äì1974 (1988) pp 771-90 Further laws were passed that made discrimination illegal and provided federal oversight to guarantee voting rights. Early in the period, an active foreign policy was pursued to help Western Europe and Asia recover from the devastation of World War II. The Marshall Plan helped Western Europe rebuild from wartime devastation. The main American goal was to contain the expansion of Communism, which was controlled by the Soviet Union until China broke away about 1960. An arms race escalated through increasingly powerful nuclear weapons. The Soviets formed the Warsaw Pact of European satellites to oppose the American-led North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) alliance. The U.S. fought a bloody, inconclusive war in Korea and was escalating the war in Vietnam as the period ended. Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and when the USSR sent in nuclear missiles to defend it, the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 was triggered with the U.S., the most dangerous point of the era.Alan P. Dobson and Steve Marsh, US foreign policy since 1945 (2006) pp 18-29, 76-90 On the domestic front, after a short transition, the economy grew rapidly, with widespread prosperity, rising wages, and the movement of most of the remaining farmers to the towns and cities. Politically, the era was dominated by liberal Democrats who held together with the New Deal Coalition: Harry Truman (1945‚Äì1953), John F. Kennedy (1961‚Äì1963) and Lyndon Johnson (1963‚Äì1969). Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower (1953‚Äì1961) was a moderate who did not attempt to reverse New Deal programs such as regulation of business and support for labor unions; he expanded Social Security and built the interstate highway system. For most of the period, the Democrats controlled Congress; however, they were usually unable to pass as much liberal legislation as they had hoped because of the power of the Conservative Coalition. The Liberal coalition took control of Congress after Kennedy's assassination in 1963, and launched the Great Society.Alonzo L. Hamby, Liberalism and Its Challengers: From F.D.R. to Bush (2nd ed. 1992) pp 52-139 This period witnessed the rise of suburbs and a growing middle class. Communitarianism and measurable social capital was at its highest point during this time.Bowling Alone: The Collapse and Revival of American Community by Robert D. Putnam Cold War =Origins= Post-war territorial changes in Europe and the formation of the Eastern Bloc, the western border is the \\"Iron Curtain\\". While Roosevelt was confident he could deal with Stalin after the war, Truman was much more suspicious. The United States provided large-scale grants to Western Europe under the Marshall Plan (1948 - 1951), leading to a rapid economic recovery. The Soviet Union refused to allow its satellites to receive American aid. Instead, the Kremlin used local Communist parties, and the Red army, to control Eastern Europe in totalitarian fashion.Anne Applebaum, Iron Curtain: The Crushing of Eastern Europe, 1944‚Äì1956 (2012) p. xxii - xxv. Britain, in deep financial trouble, could no longer support Greece in its civil war with the communists. They asked the United States to take over their role in Greece. With bipartisan support in Congress, Truman responded with the Truman Doctrine in 1947. Truman followed the intellectual leadership of the State Department, which, especially under the guidance of George F. Kennan, called for containment of Soviet communist expansion. The idea was that internal contradictions, such as diverse nationalism, would ultimately undermine Soviet ambitions.Carole K. Fink, Cold War: An International History (2013) pp 53-79. By 1947, the Soviets had fully absorbed the three Baltic nations, and effectively controlled Poland, East Germany, Czechoslovakia, Romania, and Bulgaria. Austria and Finland were neutral and demilitarized. The Kremlin did not control Yugoslavia, which had a separate communist regime under Marshall Tito; They had a permanent bitter break in 1948. The Cold War lines stabilized in Europe along the Iron Curtain, and there was no fighting. The United States helped form a strong military alliance in NATO in 1949 including most of the nations of Western Europe, and Canada. In Asia, however, there was much more movement. The United States failed to negotiate a settlement between its ally, nationalist China under Chiang Kai-shek, and the Communists under Mao Zedong. The Communists took over China in 1949 and the nationalist government moved to the offshore island of Formosa (Taiwan), which came under American protection. Local communist movements attempted to take over all of Korea (1950) and Vietnam (1954). Communist hegemony covered one third of the world's land while the United States emerged as the world's more influential superpower, and formed a worldwide network of military alliances.John Lewis Gaddis, The Cold War: A New History (2006) pp 31-95 There were fundamental contrasts between the visions of the United States and the Soviet Union, between capitalist democracy and totalitarian communism. The United States envisioned the new United Nations as a Wilsonian tool to resolve future troubles, but it failed in that purpose. The U.S. rejected totalitarianism and colonialism, in line with the principles laid down by the Atlantic Charter of 1941: self- determination, equal economic access, and a rebuilt capitalist, democratic Europe that could again serve as a hub in world affairs.Townsend Hoopes and Douglas Brinkley, FDR and the Creation of the U.N. (2000) pp 205-22 =Containment= For NATO, containment of the expansion of Soviet influence became foreign policy doctrine; the expectation was that eventually the inefficient Soviet system would collapse of internal weakness, and no \\"hot\\" war (that is, one with large-scale combat) would be necessary. Containment was supported by Republicans (led by Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan, Governor Thomas Dewey of New York, and general Dwight D. Eisenhower), but was opposed by the isolationists led by Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio. =1949‚Äì1953= In 1949, the communist leader Mao Zedong won control of mainland China in a civil war, proclaimed the People's Republic of China, then traveled to Moscow where he negotiated the Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship. China had thus moved from a close ally of the U.S. to a bitter enemy, and the two fought each other starting in late 1950 in Korea. The Truman administration responded with a secret 1950 plan, NSC 68, designed to confront the Communists with large-scale defense spending. The Russians had built an atomic bomb by 1949‚Äîmuch sooner than expected; Truman ordered the development of the hydrogen bomb. Two of the spies who gave atomic secrets to Russia were tried and executed. France was hard-pressed by Communist insurgents in the First Indochina War. The U.S. in 1950 started to fund the French effort on the proviso that the Vietnamese be given more autonomy. =Korean War= Stalin approved a North Korean plan to invade U.S.-supported South Korea in June 1950. President Truman immediately and unexpectedly implemented the containment policy by a full-scale commitment of American and UN forces to Korea. He did not consult or gain approval of Congress but did gain the approval of the United Nations (UN) to drive back the North Koreans and re- unite that country in terms of a rollback strategy.The Soviets were boycotting the UN at that time (because it would not admit the People's Republic of China) and so was not present to veto Truman's actions. After a few weeks of retreat, General Douglas MacArthur's success at the Battle of Inchon turned the war around; UN forces invaded North Korea. This advantage was lost when hundreds of thousands of Chinese entered an undeclared war against the United States and pushed the US/UN/Korean forces back to the original starting line, the 38th parallel. The war became a stalemate, with over 33,000 American dead and 100,000 wounded but nothing to show for it except a resolve to continue the containment policy. Truman fired MacArthur but was unable to end the war. Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 campaigned against Truman's failures of \\"Korea, Communism and Corruption,\\" promising to go to Korea himself and end the war. By threatening to use nuclear weapons in 1953, Eisenhower ended the war with a truce that is still in effect.Spencer Tucker, ed. The Encyclopedia of the Korean War (3 vol 2010) =Anti-Communism and McCarthyism: 1947‚Äì1954= In 1947, well before McCarthy became active, the Conservative Coalition in Congress passed the Taft Hartley Act, designed to balance the rights of management and unions, and delegitimizing Communist union leaders. The challenge of rooting out Communists from labor unions and the Democratic Party was successfully undertaken by liberals, such as Walter Reuther of the autoworkers unionMartin Halpern, \\"Taft-Hartley and the Defeat of the Progressive Alternative in the United Auto Workers,\\" Labor History, Spring 1986, Vol. 27 Issue 2, pp 204-26 and Ronald Reagan of the Screen Actors Guild (Reagan was a liberal Democrat at the time).Lou Cannon, President Reagan: the role of a lifetime (2000) p. 245 Many of the purged leftists joined the presidential campaign in 1948 of FDR's Vice President Henry A. Wallace. A 1947 booklet published by the Catholic Catechetical Guild Educational Society raising the specter of a Communist takeover The House Un-American Activities Committee, with young Congressman Richard M. Nixon playing a central role, accused Alger Hiss, a top Roosevelt aide, of being a Communist spy, using testimony and documents provided by Whittaker Chambers. Hiss was convicted and sent to prison, with the anti-Communists gaining a powerful political weapon.Sam Tanenhaus, Whittaker Chambers: a biography (1988) It launched Nixon's meteoric rise to the Senate (1950) and the vice presidency (1952).Roger Morris, Richard Milhous Nixon: The Rise of an American Politician (1991) With anxiety over Communism in Korea and China reaching fever pitch in 1950, a previously obscure Senator, Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, launched Congressional investigations into the cover-up of spies in the government. McCarthy dominated the media, and used reckless allegations and tactics that allowed his opponents to effectively counterattack. Irish Catholics (including conservative wunderkind William F. Buckley, Jr. and the Kennedy Family) were intensely anti-Communist and defended McCarthy (a fellow Irish Catholic).William F. Buckley and L. Brent Bozell, Mccarthy and His Enemies: The Record and Its Meaning (1954) Paterfamilias Joseph Kennedy (1888‚Äì1969), a very active conservative Democrat, was McCarthy's most ardent supporter and got his son Robert F. Kennedy a job with McCarthy. McCarthy had talked of \\"twenty years of treason\\" (i.e. since Roosevelt's election in 1932). When, in 1953, he started talking of \\"21 years of treason\\" and launched a major attack on the Army for promoting a Communist dentist in the medical corps, his recklessness proved too much for Eisenhower, who encouraged Republicans to censure McCarthy formally in 1954. The Senator's power collapsed overnight. Senator John F. Kennedy did not vote for censure.Richard M. Fried, Nightmare in Red: The McCarthy Era in Perspective (1990) Buckley went on to found the National Review in 1955 as a weekly magazine that helped define the conservative position on public issues. \\"McCarthyism\\" was expanded to include attacks on supposed Communist influence in Hollywood, which resulted in a black-list whereby artists who refused to testify about possible Communist connections could not get work. Some famous celebrities (such as Charlie Chaplin) left the U.S.; other worked under pseudonyms (such as Dalton Trumbo). McCarthyism included investigations into academics and teachers as well.Ellen Schrecker, The Age of McCarthyism: A Brief History with Documents (2d ed. 2002) =Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations= John Foster Dulles In 1953, Stalin died, and after the 1952 presidential election, President Dwight D. Eisenhower used the opportunity to end the Korean War, while continuing Cold War policies. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles was the dominant figure in the nation's foreign policy in the 1950s. Dulles denounced the \\"containment\\" of the Truman administration and espoused an active program of \\"liberation\\", which would lead to a \\"rollback\\" of communism. The most prominent of those doctrines was the policy of \\"massive retaliation\\", which Dulles announced early in 1954, eschewing the costly, conventional ground forces characteristic of the Truman administration in favor of wielding the vast superiority of the U.S. nuclear arsenal and covert intelligence. Dulles defined this approach as \\"brinkmanship\\".Chester J. Pach and Elmo Richardson, Presidency of Dwight D. Eisenhower (1991) A dramatic shock to Americans' self-confidence and its technological superiority came in 1957, when the Soviets beat the United States into outer space by launching Sputnik, the first earth satellite. The space race began, and by the early 1960s the United States had forged ahead, with President Kennedy promising to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s‚Äîthe landing indeed took place on July 20, 1969.Paul Dickson, Sputnik: the shock of the century (2003) Trouble close to home appeared when Fidel Castro took control of Cuba in 1959 and forged increasingly close ties with the Soviet Union, becoming communism's center in Latin America. The United States responded with an economic boycott of Cuba, and a large-scale economic support program for Latin America under Kennedy, the Alliance for Progress. East Germany was the weak point in the Soviet empire, with refugees leaving for the West by the thousands every week. The Soviet solution came in 1961, with the Berlin Wall to stop East Germans from fleeing communism. This was a major propaganda setback for the USSR, but it did allow them to keep control of East Berlin.Frederick Taylor, The Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961‚Äì1989 (2008) The Communist world split in half, as China turned against the Soviet Union; Mao denounced Khrushchev for going soft on capitalism. However, the US failed to take advantage of this split until President Richard Nixon saw the opportunity in 1969. In 1958, the U.S. sent troops into Lebanon for nine months to stabilize a country on the verge of civil war. Between 1954 and 1961, Eisenhower dispatched large sums of economic and military aid and 695 military advisers to South Vietnam to stabilize the pro-western government under attack by insurgents. Eisenhower supported CIA efforts to undermine anti-American governments, which proved most successful in Iran and Guatemala.Stephen E. Ambrose, Ike's spies: Eisenhower and the espionage establishment (1999) The first major strain among the NATO alliance occurred in 1956 when Eisenhower forced Britain and France to retreat from their invasion of Egypt (with Israel) which was intended to get back their ownership of the Suez Canal. Instead of supporting the claims of its NATO partners, the Eisenhower administration stated that it opposed French and British imperial adventurism in the region by sheer prudence, fearing that Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser's standoff with the region's old colonial powers would bolster Soviet power in the region.Cole Christian Kingseed, Eisenhower and the Suez Crisis of 1956 (1995) The Cold War reached its most dangerous point during the Kennedy administration in the Cuban Missile Crisis, a tense confrontation between the Soviet Union and the United States over the Soviet deployment of nuclear missiles in Cuba. The crisis began on October 16, 1962, and lasted for thirteen days. It was the moment when the Cold War was closest to exploding into a devastating nuclear exchange between the two superpower nations. Kennedy decided not to invade or bomb Cuba but to institute a naval blockade of the island. The crisis ended in a compromise, with the Soviets removing their missiles publicly, and the United States secretly removing its nuclear missiles in Turkey. In Moscow, Communist leaders removed Nikita Khrushchev because of his reckless behavior.Don Munton and David A. Welch, The Cuban Missile Crisis: A Concise History (2006) The Affluent Society Wartime rationing was officially lifted in September 1945, but prosperity did not immediately return as the next three years would witness the difficult transition back to a peacetime economy. Twelve million returning veterans were in need of work and in many cases could not find it. Inflation became a rather serious problem, averaging over 10% per year until 1950 and raw materials shortages dogged the manufacturing industry. In addition, labor strikes rocked the nation and were in some cases exacerbated by racial tensions: African- Americans that took jobs during the war were faced with irate returning veterans who demanded that they step aside. Munitions factories shut down and temporary workers returned home. Following the Republican takeover of Congress in the 1946 elections, President Truman was compelled to reduce taxes and curb government interference in the economy. With this done, the stage was set for the economic boom that, with only a few minor hiccups, would last for the next 23 years. Between 1945 and 1960, GNP grew by 250%, expenditures on new construction multiplied nine times, and consumption on personal services increased three times. By 1960, per capita income was 35% higher than in 1945, and America had entered what the economist Walt Rostow referred to as the \\"high mass consumption\\" stage of economic development. Short-term credit went up from $8.4 billion in 1946 to $45.6 billion in 1958. As a result of the postwar economic boom, 60% of the American population had attained a \\"middle- class\\" standard of living by the mid-1950s (defined as incomes of $3,000 to $10,000 in constant dollars), compared with only 31% in the last year of prosperity before the onset of the Great Depression in 1929. By the end of the decade, 87% of families owned a TV set, 75% owned a car, and 75% owned a washing machine. Between 1947-1960, the average real income for American workers increased by as much as it had in the previous half-century.The Unfinished Journey: America Since World War II by William H. Chafe Prosperity and overall optimism made Americans feel that it was a good time to bring children into the world, and so a huge baby boom resulted during the decade following 1945 (the baby boom climaxed during the mid-1950s, after which time birthrates gradually declined until going below replacement level in 1965). Although the overall number of children per woman was not unusually high (averaging 2.3), they were assisted by improving technology that greatly brought down infant mortality rates versus the prewar era. Among other things, this resulted in an unprecedented demand for children's products and a huge expansion of the public school system. The large size of the postwar baby-boom generation would have significant social repercussions in American society for decades to come. In 1963, Betty Friedan published her book The Feminine Mystique which ridiculed the housewife role of women during the postwar years; it was a best-seller and a major catalyst of the women's liberation movement. The American economy grew dramatically in the post-war period, expanding at a rate of 3.5% per year between 1945 and 1970. During this period of prosperity, many incomes doubled in a generation, described by economist Frank Levy as \\"upward mobility on a rocket ship.\\" The substantial increase in average family income within a generation resulted in millions of office and factory workers being lifted into a growing middle class, enabling them to sustain a standard of living once considered to be reserved for the wealthy.Nancy Wiefek, The impact of economic anxiety in postindustrial America (2003) p 3 As noted by Deone Zell, assembly-line work paid well, while unionized factory jobs served as \\"stepping-stones to the middle class.\\"Changing by design: organizational innovation at Hewlett-Packard by Deone Zell By the end of the 1950s, 87% of all American families owned at least one T.V., 75% owned cars, and 60% owned their homes.Nation's business: Volume 48, Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America, 1960 By 1960, blue-collar workers had become the biggest buyers of many luxury goods and services. In addition, by the early-1970s, post-World War II American consumers enjoyed higher levels of disposable income than those in any other country. The great majority of American workers who had stable jobs were well-off financially, while even non-union jobs were associated with rising paychecks, benefits, and obtained many of the advantages that characterized union work.Beth A. Rubin, Shifts in the social contract: understanding change in American society (1996) p 36 An upscale working class came into being, as American blue-collar workers came to enjoy the benefits of home ownership, while high wages provided blue-collar workers with the ability to pay for new cars, household appliances, and regular vacations.Promises Kept: John F. Kennedy's New Frontier by Irving Bernstein By the 1960s, a blue-collar worker earned more than a manager did in the 1940s, despite the fact that the former's relative position within the income distribution had not changed.Peter H. Schuck and James Q. Wilson, Understanding America: The Anatomy of an Exceptional Nation (2009) p 160 As noted by the historian Nancy Wierek: :\\"In the postwar period, the majority of Americans were affluent in the sense that they were in a position to spend money on many things they wanted, desired, or chose to have, rather than on necessities alone.\\"Nancy Wiefek, \\"The impact of economic anxiety in postindustrial America\\" (2003) p 3 As argued by the historians Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett: :\\"By the mid-1960s, the majority of America's organized working class who were not victims of the second Red Scare embraced, or at least tolerated, anti-communism because it was an integral part of the New American Dream to which they had committed their lives. Theirs was not an unobtainable dream; nor were their lives empty because of it. Indeed, for at least a quarter of century, the material promises of consumer-oriented Americanism were fulfilled in improvements in everyday life that made them the most affluent working class in American history.\\"Ronald Edsforth and Larry Bennett, Popular culture and political change in modern America (1991) p 125 Between 1946-1960, the United States witnessed a significant expansion in the consumption of goods and services. GNP rose by 36% and personal consumption expenditures by 42%, cumulative gains which were reflected in the incomes of families and unrelated individuals. While the number of these units rose sharply from 43.3 million to 56.1 million in 1960, a rise of almost 23%, their average incomes grew even faster, from $3,940 in 1946 to $6,900 in 1960, an increase of 43%. After taking inflation into account, the real increase was 16%. The dramatic rise in the average American standard of living was such that, according to sociologist George Katona: :\\"Today in this country minimum standards of nutrition, housing and clothing are assured, not for all, but for the majority. Beyond these minimum needs, such former luxuries as homeownership, durable goods, travel, recreation, and entertainment are no longer restricted to a few. The broad masses participate in enjoying all these things and generate most of the demand for them.\\"George Katona, The mass consumption society (1964) p 5 More than 21 million housing units were constructed between 1946 and 1960, and in the latter year 52% of consumer units in the metropolitan areas owned their own homes. In 1957, out of all the wired homes throughout the country, 96% had a refrigerator, 87% an electric washer, 81% a television, 67% a vacuum cleaner, 18% a freezer, 12% an electric or gas dryer, and 8% air conditioning. Car ownership also soared, with 72% of consumer units owning an automobile by 1960. From 1958 to 1964, the average weekly take-home pay of blue-collar workers rose steadily from $68 to $78 (in constant dollars). In a poll taken in 1949, 50% of all Americans said that they were satisfied with their family income, a figure that rose to 67% by 1969. The period from 1946 to 1960 also witnessed a significant increase in the paid leisure time of working people. The forty-hour workweek established by the Fair Labor Standards Act in covered industries became the actual schedule in most workplaces by 1960, while uncovered workers such as farmworkers and the self-employed worked fewer hours than they had done previously, although they still worked much longer hours than most other workers. Paid vacations also came to be enjoyed by the vast majority of workers, with 91% of blue-collar workers covered by major collective bargaining agreements receiving paid vacations by 1957 (usually to a maximum of three weeks), while by the early-1960s virtually all industries paid for holidays and most did so for seven days a year. Industries catering to leisure activities blossomed as a result of most Americans enjoying significant paid leisure time by 1960, while many blue-collar and white-collar workers had come to expect to hold on to their jobs for life.Stephen J. Whitfield, A companion to 20th-century America This period saw the growth of motels along major highways, as well as amusement parks such as Disneyland, which opened in 1955. Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people were graduating from high schools and universities than elsewhere in the world, as hundreds of new colleges and universities opened every year. Tuition was kept low‚Äîit was free at California state universities.James J.F. Forest and Kevin Kinser, Higher Education in the United States: An Encyclopedia (2002) p 98 At the advanced level, American science, engineering, and medicine was world-famous. By the mid-1960s, the majority of American workers enjoyed the highest wage levels in the world,American Labor by Henry Pelling and by the late-1960s, the great majority of Americans were richer than people in other countries, except Sweden, Switzerland, and Canada. Educational outlays were also greater than in other countries while a higher proportion of young people was at school and college than elsewhere in the world. As noted by the historian John Vaizey: :\\"To strike a balance with the Soviet Union, it would be easy to say that all but the very poorest Americans were better off than the Russians, that education was better but the health service worse, but that above all the Americans had freedom of expression and democratic institutions.\\"Social Democracy by John Vaizey In regards to social welfare, the post-war era saw a considerable improvement in insurance for workers and their dependents against the risks of illness, as private insurance programs like Blue Cross and Blue Shield expanded. With the exception of farm and domestic workers, virtually all members of the labor force were covered by Social Security. In 1959, about two-thirds of the factory workers and three-fourths of the office workers were provided with supplemental private pension plans. In addition, 86% of factory workers and 83% of office workers had jobs that covered for hospital insurance while 59% and 61% had additional insurance for doctors. By 1969, the average White family income had risen to $10,953, while the average Black family income lagged behind at $7,255, revealing a continued racial disparity in income among various segments of the American population. The percentage of American students continuing their education after the age of fifteen was also higher than in most other developed countries, with more than 90% of 16-year- olds and around 75% of 17-year-olds in school in 1964‚Äì66.Education in Great Britain and Ireland: A source book Edited by Robert Bell, Gerald Fowler and Ken Little, P.104 Despite overall prosperity during the 1950s, economic growth only averaged 2% a year during Eisenhower's administration, and Federal income taxes remained extremely high at over 90%, although tax evasion was common with the porous tax code of the time. There were also three recessions: the first in 1953-54 following the end of the Korean War, the second in 1958, and the third in 1960‚Äì61. In each case, the Republican Party, which had begun the Eisenhower era with a plurality in Congress, suffered the consequences. In the 1954 midterms, the Democrats regained a solid majority of both houses and they would retain unbroken control of the Senate until 1981 and the House until 1995. The 1958 recession cost the GOP yet more seats, and the 1960 recession was used by John F. Kennedy as cannon fodder against the Republicans in his presidential run. Unemployment peaked at 7% in the spring of 1961 before an economic rebound began that would continue to the end of the decade. President Kennedy then decided to break with the New Deal orthodoxy of high Federal taxes to force income equality. In a December 1962 speech, he announced his plans to reduce the top marginal tax rate to 75%, which one GOP Congressman wryly dubbed \\"the most Republican speech a president has made since McKinley\\". Although the president did not live to see his tax proposal passed, Lyndon Johnson quickly steered it through Congress, and by late-1965, real GDP growth was exceeding 6% a year. =Suburbia= Aerial view of Levittown, Pennsylvania, circa 1959Very little housing had been built during the Great Depression and World War, except for emergency quarters near war industries. Overcrowded and inadequate apartments was the common condition. Some suburbs had developed around large cities where there was rail transportation to the jobs downtown. However, the real growth in suburbia depended on the availability of automobiles, highways, and inexpensive housing. The population had grown, and the stock of family savings had accumulated the money for down payments, automobiles and appliances. The product was a great housing boom. Whereas an average of 316,000 new housing nonfarm units had been constructed each year from the 1930s through 1945, there were 1,450,000 built annually from 1946 through 1955 in all areas, especially suburbs.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Historical Statistics of the United States (1976) series H-156 The G.I. Bill guaranteed low cost loans for veterans, with very low down payments, and low interest rates. With 16,000,000 eligible veterans, the opportunity to buy a house was suddenly at hand. In 1947 alone, 540,000 veterans bought one; their average price was $7,300 (equal to $84,000 in 2020). The construction industry kept prices low by standardization ‚Äì for example standardizing sizes for kitchen cabinets, refrigerators, and stoves allowed for mass production of kitchen furnishings. Developers purchased empty land just outside the city, installed tract houses based on a handful of designs, and provided streets and utilities, as local public officials race to build schools.Joseph Goulden, The Best Years, 1945‚Äì1950 (1976) pp 135-39. The most famous development was Levittown, in Long Island just east of New York City. It offered a new house for $1,000 down, and $70 a month; it featured three bedrooms, fireplace, gas range and gas furnace, and a landscaped lot of 75 by 100 feet, all for a total price of $10,000. Veterans could get one with a much lower down payment.Barbara Mae Kelly, Expanding the American Dream: Building and Rebuilding Levittown (SUNY Press, 1993). Growth of the suburbs was especially prominent in the Sunbelt regions of the country; one example of a suburb on the West Coast was Lakewood, California, built largely to serve family of aviation workers. Going hand-in-hand with suburban development was the rise of shopping malls, fast-food restaurants and coffee shops. With Detroit turning out automobiles as fast as possible, city dwellers gave up cramped apartments for a suburban life style centered around children and housewives, with the male breadwinner commuting to work.Rosalyn Baxandall and Elizabeth Ewen, Picture Windows: How the Suburbs Happened (2000) Suburbia encompassed one- third of the nation's population by 1960. The growth of suburbs was not only a result of postwar prosperity, but innovations of the single-family housing market with low interest rates on 20 and 30 year mortgages, and low down payments, especially for veterans. Meanwhile, the suburban population swelled because of the baby boom. Suburbs provided larger homes for larger families, security from urban living, privacy, and space for consumer goods.Robert Fishman, Bourgeois Utopias: The Rise and Fall of Suburbia (1989) =Television and the consumer culture= At the center of middle-class culture in the 1950s was a growing demand for consumer goods; a result of the postwar prosperity, the increase in variety and availability of consumer products, and television advertising. America generated a steadily growing demand for better automobiles, clothing, appliances, family vacations and higher education. After the initial hurdles of the 1945-48 period were overcome, Americans found themselves flush with cash from wartime work due to there being little to buy for several years. The result was a mass consumer spending spree, with a huge and voracious demand for new homes, cars, and housewares. Increasing numbers enjoyed high wages, larger houses, better schools, more cars and home comforts like vacuum cleaners, washing machines--which were all made for labor-saving and to make housework easier. Inventions familiar in the early 21st century made their first appearance during this era. The live-in maid and cook, common features of middle-class homes at the beginning of the century, were virtually unheard of in the 1950s; only the very rich had servants. Householders enjoyed centrally heated homes with running hot water. New style furniture was bright, cheap, and light, and easy to move around.William H. Young and Nacy K. Young, The 1950s (2004) p 76 As noted by John Kenneth Galbraith in 1958: :\\"the ordinary individual has access to amenities ‚Äì foods, entertainments, personal transportation, and plumbing ‚Äì in which not even the rich rejoiced a century ago.\\" Television, a commodity virtually unheard of during the Second World War, was now prevalent in most American homes by the mid-to-late 1950s. Americans now had a wide bevy of shows to choose from, ranging from sitcoms such I Love Lucy and The Honeymooners to music and variety shows such as American Bandstand and The Ed Sullivan Show, to fantasy programs such as Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. Television also increasingly became a medium for which to advertise products. Consumerism represented one of the consequences (as well as one of the key ingredients) of the postwar economic boom. The initial quest for cars, appliances, and new furniture after the end of World War II quickly expanded into the mass consumption of goods, services, and recreational materials during the Fifties. In addition to the huge domestic market for consumer items, the United States became \\"the world's factory\\", as it was the only major power whose soil had been untouched by the war. American money and manufactured goods flooded into Europe, South Korea, and Japan and helped in their reconstruction. US manufacturing dominance would be almost unchallenged for a quarter-century after 1945. Prosperity also brought about the development of a distinct youth culture for the first time, as teenagers were not forced to work and support their family at young ages like in the past. This had its culmination in the development of new music genres such as rock-and-roll as well as fashion styles and subcultures, the most famous of which was the \\"greaser\\", a young male who drove motorcycles, sported ducktail haircuts (which were widely banned in schools) and displayed a general disregard for the law and authority. The greaser phenomenon was kicked off by the controversial youth-oriented movies The Wild One (1953) starring Marlon Brando and Rebel Without A Cause (1955) starring James Dean. =Science, technology and futurism= With the prosperity of the era, the prevailing social attitude was one of belief in science, technology, progress, and futurism, although there had been signs of this trend since the 1930s. There was comparatively little nostalgia for the prewar era and the overall emphasis was on having everything new and more advanced than before. Nonetheless, the social conformity and consumerism of the 1950s often came under attack from intellectuals (e.g. Henry Miller's books The Air-Conditioned Nightmare and Sunday After The War) and there was a good deal of unrest fermenting under the surface of American society that would erupt during the following decade. One of the key factors in postwar prosperity was a technology boom due to the experience of the war. Manufacturing had made enormous strides and it was now possible to produce consumer goods in quantities and levels of sophistication unseen before 1945. Acquisition of technology from occupied Germany also proved an asset, as it was sometimes more advanced than its American counterpart, especially in the optics and audio equipment fields. The typical automobile in 1950 was an average of $300 more expensive than the 1940 version, but also produced in twice the numbers. Luxury brands such as Cadillac, which had been largely hand-built vehicles only available to the rich, now became a mass-produced car within the price range of the upper middle-class. The rapid social and technological changes brought about a growing corporatization of America and the decline of smaller businesses, which often suffered from high postwar inflation and mounting operating costs. Newspapers declined in numbers and consolidated, both due to the above-mentioned factors and the event of TV news. The railroad industry, once one of the cornerstones of the American economy and an immense and often scorned influence on national politics, also suffered from the explosion in automobile sales and the construction of the interstate system. By the end of the 1950s, it was well into decline and by the 1970s became completely bankrupt, necessitating a takeover by the federal government. Smaller automobile manufacturers such as Nash, Studebaker, and Packard were unable to compete with the Big Three in the new postwar world and gradually declined into oblivion over the next fifteen years. Suburbanization caused the gradual movement of working-class people and jobs out of the inner cities as shopping centers displaced the traditional downtown stores. In time, this would have disastrous effects on urban areas. =Poverty and inequality in the postwar era= Despite the prosperity of the postwar era, a significant minority of Americans continued to live in poverty by the end of the 1950s. In 1947, 34% of all families earned less than $3,000 a year, compared with 22.1% in 1960. Nevertheless, between one-fifth to one-quarter of the population could not survive on the income they earned. The older generation of Americans did not benefit as much from the postwar economic boom especially as many had never recovered financially from the loss of their savings during the Great Depression. It was generally a given that the average 35-year-old in 1959 owned a better house and car than the average 65-year-old, who typically had nothing but a small Social Security pension for an income. Many blue-collar workers continued to live in poverty, with 30% of those employed in industry in 1958 receiving under $3,000 a year. In addition, individuals who earned more than $10,000 a year paid a lower proportion of their income in taxes than those who earned less than $2,000 a year. In 1947, 60% of black families lived below the poverty level (defined in one study as below $3000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 23% of white families. In 1968, 23% of black families lived below the poverty level, compared with 9% of white families. In 1947, 11% of white families were affluent (defined as above $10,000 in 1968 dollars), compared with 3% of black families. In 1968, 42% of white families were defined as affluent, compared with 21% of black families. In 1947, 8% of black families received $7000 or more (in 1968 dollars) compared with 26% of white families. In 1968, 39% of black families received $7,000 or more, compared with 66% of white families. In 1960, the median for a married man of blue- collar income was $3,993 for blacks and $5,877 for whites. In 1969, the equivalent figures were $5,746 and $7,452, respectively.Sociology: Third Edition by Paul B. Horton and Chester L. Hunt, 1972 As Socialist leader Michael Harrington emphasized, there was still The Other America.Michael Harrington, The Other America: Poverty in the United States (1962) Poverty declined sharply in the 1960s as the New Frontier and Great Society especially helped older people. The proportion below the poverty line fell almost in half from 22% in 1960 to 12% in 1970 and then leveled off.N. Gregory Mankiw, Principles of Economics (2011) p 419 graph online =Rural life= The farm population shrank steadily as families moved to urban areas, where on average they were more productive and earned a higher standard of living.Paul K. Conkin, A Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929 (2009) Friedberger argues that the postwar period saw an accelerating mechanization of agriculture, combined with new and better fertilizers and genetic manipulation of hybrid corn. It made for greater specialization and greater economic risks for the farmer. With rising land prices many sold their land and moved to town, the old farm becoming part of a neighbor's enlarged operation. Mechanization meant less need for hired labor; farmers could operate more acres even though they were older. The result was a decline in rural-farm population, with gains in service centers that provided the new technology. The rural non-farm population grew as factories were attracted by access to good transportation without the high land costs, taxes, unionization and congestion of city factory districts. Once remote rural areas such as the Missouri Ozarks and the North Woods of the upper Midwest, with a rustic life style and many good fishing spots, attracted retirees and vacationers.Mark Friedberger, \\"The Transformation of the Rural Midwest, 1945‚Äì1985,\\" Old Northwest, 1992, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 13-36 Civil Rights Movement Following the end of Reconstruction, many states adopted restrictive Jim Crow laws which enforced segregation of the races and the second-class status of African Americans. The Supreme Court in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) accepted segregation as constitutional. Voting rights discrimination remained widespread through the 1950s. Fewer than 10% voted in the Deep South, although a larger proportion voted in the border states, and blacks in the northern urban areas had shifted wholesale to the Democrats during the New Deal era. Although both parties pledged progress in 1948, the only major development before 1954 was the integration of the military.Harvard Sitkoff, The Struggle for Black Equality (2008) The Civil Rights Act of 1957 was the first piece of Federal civil rights legislation in almost a century, and would pave the way for the climactic Civil Rights Act of 1964. =Brown v. Board of Education and \\"massive resistance\\"= In the early days of the Civil Rights Movement, litigation and lobbying were the focus of integration efforts. The U.S. Supreme Court decisions in Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka (1954); Powell v. Alabama (1932); Smith v. Allwright (1944); Shelley v. Kraemer (1948); Sweatt v. Painter (1950); and McLaurin v. Oklahoma State Regents (1950) led to a shift in tactics, and from 1955 to 1965, \\"direct action\\" was the strategy--primarily bus boycotts, sit-ins, freedom rides, and social movements. Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka was a landmark case of the United States Supreme Court which explicitly outlawed segregated public education facilities for blacks and whites, ruling so on the grounds that the doctrine of \\"separate but equal\\" public education could never truly provide black Americans with facilities of the same standards available to white Americans. One hundred and one members of the United States House of Representatives and 19 Senators signed \\"The Southern Manifesto\\" condemning the Supreme Court decision as unconstitutional. Governor Orval Eugene Faubus (Democrat) of Arkansas used the Arkansas National Guard to prevent school integration at Little Rock Central High School in 1957. President Eisenhower (Republican) nationalized state forces and sent in the US Army to enforce federal court orders. Governors Ross Barnett of Mississippi and George Wallace of Alabama physically blocked school doorways at their respective states' universities. Birmingham's public safety commissioner Eugene T. \\"Bull\\" Connor advocated violence against freedom riders and ordered fire hoses and police dogs turned on demonstrators during the 1963 Birmingham Children's Crusade. Sheriff Jim Clark of Dallas County, Alabama, loosed his deputies during the \\"Bloody Sunday\\" event of the Selma to Montgomery march, injuring many of the marchers and personally menacing other protesters. Police all across the South arrested civil rights activists on trumped-up charges. =Civil rights organizations= Martin Luther King Jr. speaking in Washington, D.C. at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom in 1963 Although they had white supporters and sympathizers, the Civil Rights Movement was designed, led, organized, and manned by African-Americans, who placed themselves and their families on the front lines in the struggle for freedom. Their heroism was brought home to every American through newspaper, and later, television reports as their peaceful marches and demonstrations were violently attacked by law enforcement. Officers used batons, bullwhips, fire hoses, police dogs, and mass arrests to intimidate the protesters. The second characteristic of the movement is that it was not monolithic, led by one or two men. Rather it was a dispersed, grass-roots campaign that attacked segregation in many different places using many different tactics. While some groups and individuals within the civil rights movement--such as Malcolm X--advocated Black Power, black separatism, or even armed resistance, the majority of participants remained committed to the principles of nonviolence, a deliberate decision by an oppressed minority to abstain from violence for political gain. Using nonviolent strategies, civil rights activists took advantage of emerging national network-news reporting, especially television, to capture national attention.Taylor Branch, Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954‚Äì1963 (1988) The leadership role of black churches in the movement was a natural extension of their structure and function. They offered members an opportunity to exercise roles denied them in society. Throughout history, the black church served as a place of worship and also as a base for powerful ministers, such as Congressman Adam Clayton Powell in New York City. The most prominent clergyman in the Civil Rights Movement was Martin Luther King Jr. Time magazine's 1963 \\"Man of the Year\\" showed tireless personal commitment to black freedom and his strong leadership won him worldwide acclaim and the 1964 Nobel Peace Prize. Students and seminarians in both the South and the North played key roles in every phase of the movement. Church and student-led movements, such as the Nashville Student Movement, developed their own organizational and sustaining structures. The Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), founded in 1957, coordinated and raised funds, mostly from northern sources, for local protests and for the training of black leaders. The Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, founded in 1957, developed the \\"jail-no-bail\\" strategy. SNCC's role was to develop and link sit-in campaigns and to help organize freedom rides, voter registration drives, and other protest activities. These three new groups often joined forces with existing organizations such as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), founded in 1909, the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), founded in 1942, and the National Urban League. The NAACP and its Director, Roy Wilkins, provided legal counsel for jailed demonstrators, helped raise bail, and continued to test segregation and discrimination in the courts as it had been doing for half a century. CORE initiated the 1961 Freedom Rides which involved many SNCC members, and CORE's leader James Farmer later became executive secretary of SNCC. The administration of President John F. Kennedy supported enforcement of desegregation in schools and public facilities. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy brought more than 50 lawsuits in four states to secure black Americans' right to vote. However, FBI director J. Edgar Hoover, concerned about possible communist influence in the civil rights movement and personally antagonistic to King, used the FBI to discredit King and other civil rights leaders.James Giglio, The Presidency of John F. Kennedy (1991), Presidential administrations =Truman: 1945‚Äì1953= Truman, a self-educated farm boy from Missouri, stood in sharp contrast to the urbane and imperious Roosevelt who kept personal control of all major decisions.Alonzo L. Hamby, Man of the People: A Life of Harry S. Truman (1995) Truman was a folksy, unassuming president who relied on his cabinet, remarking \\"The buck stops here\\" and \\"If you can't stand the heat, you better get out of the kitchen.\\"David McCullough, Truman (1992) p 717 Truman faced many challenges in domestic affairs. His poll ratings were sky high when he took office in April 1945 after Roosevelt's sudden death, then plunged to low levels for most of his eight years in office. The disorderly postwar reconversion of the economy of the United States was marked by severe shortages of housing, meat, appliance, automobiles and other rationed goods. The country was hit by long strikes in major industries in 1946, and Truman's unpopularity was such that the GOP regained Congress in a landslide during the midterms that year, and proceeded to pass the Taft‚ÄìHartley Act over his veto. He used executive orders to end racial discrimination in the armed forces and created loyalty checks that dismissed thousands of communist fellow travelers from office. Truman's presidency was also eventful in foreign affairs, with the defeat of Nazi Germany and his decision to use nuclear weapons against Japan, the founding of the United Nations, the Marshall Plan of 1948 to rebuild Europe, the Truman Doctrine of 1947 to contain communism, the beginning of the Cold War, the Berlin Airlift of 1948, and in 1949 the creation of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) military alliance. Truman confounded all predictions to win election in 1948, helped by his famous Whistle Stop Tour which reinvigorated the New Deal Coalition. In addition, the short-lived GOP dominance of Congress was ended as the Democratic Party regained a comfortable majority in both houses, something they would surrender only once in the next 32 years. His victory validated his domestic liberalism, his foreign policy of containment, and the new federal commitment to civil rights.Andrew E. Busch, Truman's Triumphs: The 1948 Election and the Making of Postwar America (2012) The defeat of America's wartime ally in the Chinese Civil War brought a hostile Communist regime to China under Mao Zedong. Soon the US became bogged down fighting China in the Korean War, 1950‚Äì53. Corruption in Truman's administration, which was linked to cabinet-level appointees and senior White House staff, was a central issue in the 1952 presidential campaign. Truman's third term hopes were dashed by a poor showing in the 1952 primaries. Republican Dwight D. Eisenhower, the famous wartime general, won a landslide in the 1952 presidential election by campaigning against Truman's failures in terms of \\"Communism, Korea and Corruption.\\"Richard S. Kirkendall, Harry S. Truman Encyclopedia (1990) =Eisenhower: 1953‚Äì1961= Eisenhower had been a prospective presidential candidate since the end of World War II, and although he publicly announced himself a Republican, he declined the party's offers to run in 1948. However, four years later, he reconsidered, in part because he believed the Democratic Party had had a monopoly on power for too long (control of the White House for 19 straight years and Congress for 16 of the last 19 years) and it was necessary to restore a proper two party balance. Also, the GOP in their desperation to regain power had begun supporting controversial figures such as Joseph McCarthy. As a national hero, Eisenhower carried every major demographic bloc and all states outside the South in the 1952 presidential election. He ended the Korean War, maintained the peace in Asia and the Middle East, and worked smoothly with NATO allies in Europe while keeping the policy of containing Communism rather than trying to roll it back.Richard A. Melanson and David Mayers, eds., Reevaluating Eisenhower: American Foreign Policy in the Fifties (1988) While frugal in budget matters he expanded Social Security and did not try to repeal the remaining New Deal programs. He launched the interstate highway system (using a tax on gasoline) that dramatically improved the nation's transportation infrastructure.Dan McNichol, The Roads That Built America: The Incredible Story of the U.S. Interstate System (2005) The economy was generally healthy, apart from a sharp economic recession in 1958.Harold G. Vatter, The U. S. Economy in the 1950s: An Economic History (1984) Eisenhower remained popular and largely avoided partisan politics; he was reelected by a landslide in 1956. In both foreign and domestic policy Eisenhower remained on friendly terms with the Democrats, who regained Congress in 1954 and made large gains in 1958. His farewell address to the nation warned of the dangers of a growing \\"military‚Äìindustrial complex.\\" =Kennedy: 1961-1963= 1960 presidential election The very close 1960 election pitted Republican Vice President Richard Nixon against the Democratic Senator John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts. Historians have explained Kennedy's victory in terms of an economic recession, the numerical dominance of 17 million more registered Democrats than Republicans, the votes that Kennedy gained among Catholics practically matched the votes Nixon gained among Protestants,Shaun A. Casey, The Making of a Catholic President: Kennedy vs. Nixon, 1960 (2009) Kennedy's better organization, and Nixon's superior campaigning skills. Nixon's emphasis on his experience carried little weight, and he wasted energy by campaigning in all 50 states instead of concentrating on the swing states. Kennedy used his large, well-funded campaign organization to win the nomination, secure endorsements, and with the aid of the last of the big-city bosses, to get out the vote in the big cities. He relied on Johnson to hold the South and used television effectively.Hal Brands, \\"Burying Theodore White: Recent Accounts of the 1960 Presidential Election,\\" Presidential Studies Quarterly 2010. Vol. 40#2 pp 364+.W. J. Rorabaugh, The Real Making of the President: Kennedy, Nixon, and the 1960 Election (2009) Kennedy was the first Catholic to run for president since Al Smith's ill-fated campaign in 1928. Voters were polarized on religious grounds, but Kennedy's election was a transforming event for Catholics, who finally realized they were accepted in America, and it marked the virtual end of anti-Catholicism as a political force.Lawrence H. Fuchs, John F. Kennedy and American Catholicism (1967) Presidency The Kennedy Family had long been leaders of the Irish Catholic wing of the Democratic Party; JFK was middle-of-the-road or liberal on domestic issues and conservative on foreign policy, sending military forces into Cuba and Vietnam. The Kennedy style called for youth, dynamism, vigor and an intellectual approach to aggressive new policies in foreign affairs. The downside was his inexperience in foreign affairs, standing in stark contrast to the vast experience of the president he replaced. He is best known for his call to civic virtue: \\"And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you - ask what you can do for your country.\\" In Congress the Conservative Coalition blocked nearly all of Kennedy's domestic programs, so there were few changes in domestic policy, even as the civil rights movement gained momentum.James Giglio, The Presidency of John F. Kennedy (1991) =Assassination= President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963 by Lee Harvey Oswald. The event proved to be one of the greatest psychological shocks to the American people in the 20th century and led to Kennedy being revered as a martyr and hero. =Johnson, 1963‚Äì1969= After Kennedy's assassination, vice president Lyndon Baines Johnson served out the remainder of the term, using appeals to finish the job that Kennedy had started to pass a remarkable package of liberal legislation that he called the Great Society. Johnson used the full powers of the presidency to ensure passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. These actions helped Johnson to win a historic landslide in the 1964 presidential election over conservative champion Senator Barry Goldwater. Johnson's big victory brought an overwhelming liberal majority in Congress.Randall Woods, LBJ: Architect of American Ambition (2006).

Diners offer a wide range of foods, mostly American cuisine, a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Many diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant shift work stay open for 24 hours. Many diners share an archetypal exterior form. Some of the earliest were converted rail cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings. From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as \\"lunch cars\\", were usually prefabricated in factories, like modern mobile homes, and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck. This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise. Diners were historically small businesses operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time. Diners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as hamburgers, french fries, club sandwiches, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as meatloaf. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flat- top. Coffee is a diner staple. Diners often serve hand-blended milkshakes and desserts such as pies, which are typically displayed in a glass case. Comfort food cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare. Classic American diners often have an exterior layer of stainless steel siding‚Äîa feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro style features also found in some restored drive-ins and old movie theatres. History The Rosebud, a restored 1941 Worcester Lunch Car #773 in Somerville, Massachusetts A crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the Providence Journal, in Providence, Rhode Island. Scott's diner can be considered the first diner with walk-up service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon. Commercial production of such \\"lunch wagons\\" began in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his \\"White House Cafe\\" wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a \\"Night-Lunch Wagon.\\" He built his \\"fancy night cafes\\" and \\"night lunch wagons\\" in the Worcester area until 1901. =Prefabricated diners= As the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment. The Transfer Station neighborhood of Union City, New Jersey was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey. Jerry O'Mahony (1890-1969), who hailed from Bayonne, New Jersey, is credited by some to have made the first such \\"diner\\".p.16 Westergaard, Barbara A Guide to New Jersey Rutgers University Press The O'Mahony Diner Company of Elizabeth, New Jersey, produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952. Only approximately twenty remain throughout the United States and abroad. Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O'Mahony was still just 16. Until the Great Depression, most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After World War II, as the economy returned to civilian production and the suburbs boomed, diners were an attractive small business opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the Midwest, with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the Interstate Highway System was implemented in the U.S. in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travellers would stop for a meal. The Bendix Diner in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey In many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by fast food restaurants, but in parts of New Jersey, New York, the New England states, Delaware, and Pennsylvania, the independently owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including Cape Cod and Colonial styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish wallpaper, fountains, crystal chandeliers and Greek statuary. The definition of the term \\"diner\\" began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated facade. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.

Inspired by the streamlined trains, and especially the Burlington Zephyr, Roland Stickney designed a diner in the shape of a streamlined train called the Sterling Streamliner in 1939. Built by the J.B. Judkins coach company, which had built custom car bodies, the Sterling and other diner production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II. Two Sterling Streamliners remain in operation: the Salem Diner at its original location in Salem, Massachusetts and the Modern Diner in Pawtucket, Rhode Island. Architecture Interior of a 1938 Sterling manufactured diner, with curved ceiling, in Wellsboro, Pennsylvania Like a mobile home, the original style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s-1940s feature Art Deco or Streamline Moderne elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a \\"barrel vault\\" roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use stainless steel panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, terrazzo floors, Formica, and neon sign trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter). Cultural significance Edward Hopper's iconic Nighthawks (1942) captured the ambiance of an urban diner at night Diners attract a wide spectrum of the local populations, and are generally small businesses. From the mid-twentieth century onwards, they have been seen as quintessentially American, reflecting the perceived cultural diversity and egalitarian nature of the country at large. Throughout much of the 20th century, diners, mostly in the Northeast, were often owned and operated by Greek-American immigrant families. The presence of Greek casual food, like gyros and souvlaki, on several northeastern diners' menus, testifies to this cultural link. Diners frequently stay open 24 hours a day, especially in cities, and were once the most widespread 24-hour public establishments in the U.S., making them an essential part of urban culture, alongside bars and nightclubs; these two segments of nighttime urban culture often find themselves intertwined, as many diners get a good deal of late-night business from persons departing drinking establishments. Many diners were also historically placed near factories which operated 24 hours a day, with night shift workers providing a key part of the customer base. For this reason, diners sometimes served as symbols of loneliness and isolation. Edward Hopper's iconic 1942 painting Nighthawks depicts a diner and its occupants, late at night. The diner in the painting is based on a real location in Greenwich Village, but was chosen in part because diners were anonymous slices of Americana, meaning that the scene could have been taken from any city in the country-and also because a diner was a place to which isolated individuals, awake long after bedtime, would naturally be drawn. The spread of the diner meant that by 1942 it was possible for Hopper to cast this institution in a role for which, fifteen years earlier, he had used an Automat all-night restaurant. But as a rule, diners were always symbols of American optimism. Norman Rockwell made his 1958 painting, The Runaway, generically American by placing his subjects, a young boy and a protective highway patrolman, at the counter of an anonymous diner.Norman Rockwell - The Runaway In television and cinema (e.g. The Blob, Happy Days, Grease and Diner), diners and soda fountains have come to symbolize the period of prosperity and optimism in America in the 1950s. They are shown as the place where teenagers meet after school and as an essential part of a date. The television show Alice used a diner as the setting for the program, and one is often a regular feature in sitcoms such as Seinfeld. The diner's cultural influence continues today. Many non-prefab restaurants (including franchises like Denny's) have copied the look of 1950s diners for nostalgic appeal, while Waffle House uses an interior layout derived from the diner. Manhattan was once known for its diners. The Moondance Diner was shipped to Wyoming to make room for development. Diners provide a nationwide, recognizable, fairly uniform place to eat and assemble, desirable traits mirrored by fast food chains. The types of food served are likely to be consistent, especially within a region (exceptions being districts with large immigrant populations, in which diners and coffee shops will often cater their menus to those local cuisines), as are the prices charged. At the same time, diners have much more individuality than fast food chains; the structures, menus, and even owners and staff, while having a certain degree of similarity to each other, vary much more widely than the more rigidly standardized chain and franchise restaurants. The Poirier's Diner and Munson Diner, both manufactured by the Kullman Dining Car Company of Lebanon, New Jersey, are listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Cuisine A bacon cheeseburger from a New York City diner in a to-go container, with a pickle slice, onion rings, coleslaw and french fries Many diners serve a metal cup alongside a milkshake, containing what cannot fit in the glass. Diners almost invariably serve American food such as hamburgers, french fries, club sandwiches, and other simple fare. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a grill. There is often an emphasis on breakfast foods such as eggs (including omelettes), waffles, pancakes, and French toast. Like the British greasy spoon, the typical American diner serves mainly fried or grilled food, for example: fried eggs, bacon, hamburgers, hot dogs, hash browns, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, deep fried chicken, patty melts, and sausages. These are often accompanied by baked beans, french fries, cole slaw, or toast. Some diners serve these \\"breakfast foods\\" throughout the business day and others that focus on breakfast may close in the early afternoon. These are most commonly known as pancake houses. Coffee is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners do not serve alcoholic drinks, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others‚Äîparticularly in New Jersey and on Long Island‚Äîcarry a full drink menu, including mixed drinks. Many diners serve hand-blended milkshakes. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than twelve dollars. There is regional variation among diners with traditional regional American food. In Michigan and the Ohio Valley at \\"Coney Island‚Äìstyle\\" restaurants, coney dogs are served, as are certain types of Greek cuisine like gyros influenced by Greek diner owners. In Indiana and Illinois, fried pork tenderloin sandwiches are typically on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with fried clams and fried shrimp commonly found in Maine. In Pennsylvania, cheesesteak sandwiches and scrapple are fixtures in most diners. Diners in the southwest serve tamales. In the southern U.S., typical breakfast dishes include grits, biscuits and gravy, and soul food such as fried chicken and collard greens. In New Jersey, the \\"Pork roll, Egg, and Cheese Sandwich\\" is a staple of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the desserts. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases. Typical desserts include a variety of pies, often on view in a separate transparent case. Most diners in New York and Chicago also offer cheesecake. Immigrant influences Several foreign ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry. Many diners in the United States‚Äîespecially in New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut‚Äîare owned or operated by Greek Americans. Eastern European owners, chiefly Polish, Ukrainian, and Eastern European Jews, are also typical. Italian Americans also have a notable presence. And in some places where there are significant Latino populations, Mexicans and Cubans may also have notable presences. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek moussaka, Slavic blintzes, and Jewish matzah ball soup, deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox. In media The diner Jax At The Tracks in Truckee, California, was featured in the food reality television series Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives in June 2010 John Baeder, 2007, John's Diner with John's Chevelle Diners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In I Love Lucy, the episode titled 'The Diner' shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as Sullivan's Travels and The Killers. The 1982 \\"rites of passage\\" film Diner was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists. Waitress in 2007 was about a waitress in a diner. Television series include the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives. Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants, is a 1993 documentary. The diner as an institution was iconically captured by painter Edward Hopper in his 1942 Nighthawks, a vignette mimicked by a movie lead-in aired nightly on the Turner Classic Movie Channel. Diners are the focus of photorealist painter John Baeder who spent about 40 years painting diners across the US. Pinball machine In 1990, WMS Industries (then known as Williams) introduced a pinball machine entitled Diner. The object of the game is to serve all customers to light-up Dine Time (the jackpot).

The Commander British Forces Middle East, the in-theatre commander, based in Riyadh, was initially Air Vice Marshal (AVM) Andrew Wilson (September‚ÄìOctober 1990), then Lieutenant-General Sir Peter de la Billi√®re 6 October 1990 ‚Äì March 1991, and Air Commodore Ian Macfadyen from March 1991. The Air Commander British Forces Middle East, initially Arabian Peninsula, was Air Vice Marshal Andrew Wilson from August to 17 November 1990, then Air Vice Marshal William (Bill) Wratten from 17 November 1990. The Senior British Naval Officer Middle East was Captain Anthony McEwen, Royal Navy until September 1990, on , then Commodore Paul Haddacks from September to December 1990. Finally, Commodore Christopher Craig, on and , was in command from 3 December 1990 to March 1991. Royal Air Force Royal Air Force Tornado F3, an aircraft used by the RAF in the Gulf War. Within nine days of the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, 12 Panavia Tornado F3 interceptors from 5 (AC) Squadron and 29 (F) Squadron from RAF Coningsby had arrived in Saudi Arabia, alongside aircraft of the United States Air Force (USAF). Later, Jaguar GR1 aircraft from RAF Coltishall, and Tornado GR1s, redeployed from service in RAF Germany deployed to the theatre. Buccaneer aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth were also deployed in order to laser designate ground targets for the Tornado and Jaguar. This action had the effect of maintaining the confidence of friendly nations, and limiting the potential for further Iraqi expansion. When an economic embargo was placed on Iraq, these aircraft also helped maintain it. The force of Tornado F3s was expanded to 18, drawn from the three British bases then housing F3s (RAF Leuchars, RAF Leeming, and RAF Coningsby), with 27 air crew and 350 ground personnel. They were based at the Royal Saudi Air Force airbase at Dhahran, from where they flew patrols inside the range of Iraqi ground radar systems. Before the launch of the operation to liberate Kuwait, they flew over 2000 sorties. Victor tankers based at Jubail Naval Base provided AAR support to all the coalition aircraft. Hercules, VC10, and TriStar aircraft supplied both the Royal Air Force and other military endeavours; Nimrod MR.2P aircraft assisted naval operations. At bases in Tabuk, Dhahran, and Muharraq, the RAF deployed Rapier missiles as part of surface-to-air defences. In total, around 6,000 RAF personnel were deployed to the Gulf. RAF commanders, along with the other partners in the coalition, deemed it necessary to prevent the Iraqi Air Force (IrAF) operating to any significant degree. Believed to have around 700 combat aircraft, as well as Scud ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, they could not be left to help support Iraqi ground forces, now entrenched in positions on the border. Because of the level of supplies coming from Iraq to forces in Kuwait, it would have been impossible to separate targets merely in Kuwait from an offensive into Iraq. Coalition forces outnumbered the IrAF 3-to-1. The first part of the Gulf War air campaign was directed against the IrAF. Early on 17 January, RAF Tornado GR1s flew into Iraq, with air-to-air refuelling tanker support. The first targets were Iraqi airbases, which housed a variety of defence systems and aircraft. These attacks were co-ordinated in Riyadh by the Joint Allied Headquarters, with Wratten now leading the British command; aircraft were almost totally integrated into a single coalition force. Support aircraft in raids, therefore, could be from any coalition power. Within 24 hours, a hundred sorties had been completed. After seven days, the RAF's focus, like the rest of coalition air forces, was moved to targets related to the support of Iraqi forces in Kuwait. These included oil refinery, and strategic bridges over the River Euphrates. During operations, civilians were killed when the sophisticated guidance systems on the weaponry used failed, and buildings close to these bridges (many in populated areas) were hit instead. On the whole, many pilots were frustrated by the lack of combat. In every combat role, the RAF was second to USAF involvement, but ahead of other members of the coalition. Of the around 55 Allied aircraft lost, eight were RAF Tornados; these aircraft types flew a total of 2,500 sorties. Five air crew were lost in operations, and three in preparations. British Army British Army Challenger 1 tank during the Gulf War. During the ground phase, the British 1st Armoured Division of the British Army took part in the \\"left- hook\\" which outflanked Iraqi forces. It participated in the Battle of Norfolk. British Challenger tanks destroyed approximately 300 Iraqi vehicles, including achieving the longest-range tank-kill in the war from three miles away. A friendly fire incident, when an American Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt aircraft attacked two British Warrior vehicles, resulted in the deaths of nine British service personnel. Royal Navy The Royal Navy made a significant contribution to Allied efforts in the early stages of the war. In particular, Royal Navy Westland Lynx helicopters were responsible for the destruction of almost the entire Iraqi Navy. Additionally, Royal Navy minehunters cleared Iraqi mines near the Kuwaiti coast, allowing the US battleships Wisconsin and Missouri to move in close enough to launch devastating bombardments against Iraqi ground forces. HMS Gloucester intercepted an Iraqi Silkworm missile heading towards HMS London, mine countermeasures vessels, and the US battleships.

According to Beijing Youth Daily, an estimated 20 monsters were reported, however \\"scientists are skeptical that any large creature would be able to survive in the lake given its recent history of volcanic activity\\", and skeptics say \\"it's all in the imagination, or just a floating volcanic rock\\". Sightings The first reported sighting was in 1903. It was claimed that a large buffalo-like creature attacked three people, but was shot six times. The monster then retreated under the water. In 21 to 23 August 1962, a person using a telescope reportedly saw two of the monsters chasing each other in water. More than a hundred people reported the sightings. More recent reports describe the monster as having a human-like head attached to a 1.5 m neck. It is said to have a white ring around the bottom of its neck, and the rest of its skin is grey and smooth. In 2007, Zhuo Yongsheng, a Chinese TV reporter said he had shot a 20-minute video of six unidentified creatures in the volcanic lake on 6 September. He later sent still photos to Xinhua's Jilin provincial bureau. According to a news report one of these showed the six \\"Nessies\\" swimming in parallel in three pairs. Another one of them featured the animals closer together, leaving circular ripples on the lake surface.

Some scholars have charted the entity's development from First Nations folklore and widespread water monster folklore motifs. The Ogopogo now plays a role in the commercial symbolism and media representation of the region. Background Okanagan Lake is the largest of five inter-connected freshwater fjord lakes in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. Named after the First Nations people who first inhabited the area, it was created when melting glaciers flooded a valley 10,000 years ago. It stretches for 127.1 kilometre (79 miles) and has a maximum depth of 232.3 metre (762 feet) and an average depth of 75.9 metre (249 feet). Okanagan has frozen over during eight winters in the last 110 years. Etymology Sheet music cover The origins of the palindromic name Ogopogo remain unclear. According to historian Mark M. Orkin, \\"according to canon\\", the creature received its name \\"on a night in 1924 when the strains of an English music- hall song were first heard in the city of Vernon, British Columbia\\". Orkin cites the following lines from the song: :His mother was an earwig, :His father was a whale; :A little bit of head :And hardly any tail‚Äî :And Ogopogo was his name. Orkin, however, notes that \\"A somewhat different form of the song appeared in the Vancouver Province in 1912, August 24, 1926. According to the DC the name was first applied in 1912.\\" Additionally, the creature may sometimes be referred to by the pet name Oggy.Orkin, Mark M. 2015 [1971]. Speaking Canadian English: An Informal Account of the English Language in Canada, p. 205. Routledge. Smaller creatures may be referred to as Ogopups. History =Native origins= Rattlesnake Island, where native myths claimed N'ha-a-itk lived According to Radford, the Ogopogo is \\"more closely tied to native myths than is any other lake monster.\\" The Secwepemc and Syilx natives regarded the Ogopogo, which they called the Naitaka, as \\"an evil supernatural entity with great power and ill intent.\\" The word \\"n'ha-a-itk\\" has various translations, such as \\"water-demon\\", \\"water god\\", or \\"sacred creature of the water\\". In native lore, Naitaka demanded a live sacrifice for safe crossing of the lake. For hundreds of years, First Nations would sacrifice small animals before entering the water. Oral traditions often described visiting chief Timbasket, who rejected the required sacrifice, refuting the existence of the demon. Upon entering the lake on a canoe with his family, Naitaka \\"whipped up the surface of the lake with his long tail\\" and the canoe and its occupants was sucked to the bottom of the lake. The Naitaka was often described as using its tail to create fierce storms to drown victims. Local lore claims that Sir John Lambton killed a \\"wyrm\\" from the lake, which resulted in all of his descendents coming under a witch's curse which would not allow any Lambton to die in bed. In 1855, settler John MacDougal claimed that his horses were sucked down into the water, and nearly his canoe before he cut the line. The Naitaka was said to reside in caves under Rattlesnake Island (a.k.a. Monster Island) or adjacent to Squally Point. =Alleged sightings= Ogopogo is said to inhabit Okanagan Lake Susan Allison's 1872 sighting was the first detailed Ogopogo account from a white settler. She was the first non-native person to live in the region, establishing relations with the native peoples. While driving on Highway 97 in 1968, Art Folden noticed something moving in the lake. He pulled off the road and filmed what he claimed to be footage of the alleged creature, showing a large wake moving across the water. Foldern estimated that the Ogopogo was 300 yards offshore. A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object. Folden noticed \\"something large and lifelike\\"; in the distance out on the calm water and pulled out his home movie camera to capture the object. A 2005 investigation conducted by Benjamin Radford with Joe Nickell and John Kirk for the National Geographic Channel TV show Is It Real?, utilized surveyor boats to find the actual distance of the alleged creature from the shore. They found that it was much closer to shore than originally thought, resulting in a reduction of actual size and speed. They concluded that it was likely a real animal but its size had been greatly overestimated and that it was probably a water fowl, otter, or beaver too far away to be identified. In the 1980s, a local tourism agency offered a cash reward for a proven sighting of the beast. Greenpeace announced that the beast must be filmed and not captured; the Ogopogo was listed as an endangered species. In 1980, around 50 tourists watched an alleged Ogopogo for about 45 minutes off a beach at Kelowna. Larry Thal, a tourist from Vancouver, shot some 8mm film, albeit for only 10 seconds. Some skeptics have suggested that it was only a pair of otters.In 1989, John Kirk reportedly saw an animal which was 10.7 to 12.2 metre (35 to 40 feet) long and consisted of \\"five sleek jet- black humps\\" with a lashing tail. He believed it to be traveling at around 40 kilometre (25 miles) per hour. On July 24, 1992, videotaped \\"something or some things\\" that were \\"traveling just below the surface of the water at a fairly good speed, estimated at 8 kilometre (5 miles) per hour.\\" A boat towing a water skier suddenly appears in frame and the skier falls into the water near the object. Within several minutes, DeMara made two other videotapes, each showing what appeared to be multiple animals in the water. Benjamin Radford suggested that the creature was only several otters. In 2005, FBI video specialist Grant Fredricks concluded that the object \\"was very consistent with debris from a fallen tree in the water,\\" noting that it \\"very slowly bobs up and down.\\" He also pointed out that the alleged creature did not react to the water skier, and the skier did not seem alarmed. In 2011, a cell phone video captured two dark shapes in the water. A suggested explanation is that the video shows two logs. Radford analyzed the video for Discovery News and concluded that ‚ÄúThe video quality is poor and the camera is shaky, but a closer look at the 30-second video reveals that, instead of one long object, there are actually two shorter ones, and they seem to be floating next to each other at slightly different angles. There are no humps, nor head, nor form; only two long, darkish, more or less straight forms that appear to be a few dozen feet long. In short, they look a lot like floating logs, which would not be surprising since Okanagan Lake has tens of thousands of logs harvested by the timber industry floating just under the lake's surface.\\" In September 2018, there were reportedly three sightings, one of which was described as a giant snake that was about long. Rationalization Otters, especially when swimming in a row, may be mistaken for a lake monster According to skeptical author Benjamin Radford, contemporary sightings of Ogopogo were most likely misidentifications of water fowl, otter, or beaver, adding, \\"[the First Nations stories] were not referring to a literal lake monster like Ogopogo, but instead to a legendary water spirit. Though the supernatural N'ha-a-itk of the Okanagan Valley Indians are long gone, a decidedly less fearsome ‚Äî and more biological ‚Äî beast, whose exact form is a matter of debate, has replaced it.\\". Joe Nickel and Benjamin Radford propose an origin in claims of \\"sightings\\" in wildife in the region. Otters often swim in a row and their motion can often be mistaken for one continuous serpent. Radford pointed to John Kirk's 1989 sighting as likely being a group of otters. Sturgeon are often mistaken as lake monsters, but their existence in Okanagan is unclear. There is currently an unclaimed $10,000 dollar reward for concrete evidence of sturgeon in Okanagan. Benjamin Radford has pointed to waterspouts as a likely source of inspiration for First Nation myths. Waterspouts are fairly common on Okanagan Lake, often forming when air temperatures drop and the lake still has a relatively warm water temperature.

It was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1930, with a height of . More than a century after its construction, it remains one of the 100 tallest buildings in the United States. The Woolworth Building is located in Manhattan's Tribeca neighborhood, bounded by Broadway and City Hall Park to its east, Park Place to its north, and Barclay Street to its south. It consists of a 30-story tower atop a 30-story base. Its facade is mostly decorated with terracotta, though the lower portions are limestone, and it features thousands of windows. The ornate lobby contains various sculptures, mosaics, and architectural touches. The structure was also designed with several amenities and attractions, including a now-closed observatory on the 57th floor and a private swimming pool in the basement. The skyscraper was originally conceived by F. W. Woolworth, the founder of a brand of popular five-and-ten-cent stores, as a headquarters for his company. Woolworth planned the skyscraper jointly with the Irving National Exchange Bank, which also agreed to use the structure as its headquarters. The Woolworth Building had originally been planned as a 12- to 16-story commercial building, but underwent several revisions during its planning process. Its final height was not decided upon until January 1911. Construction started in 1910 and was completed two years later. The building officially opened on April 24, 1913. The Woolworth Building underwent several changes throughout its history. The facade was cleaned in 1932, and the building received an extensive renovation between 1977 and 1981. The Irving National Exchange Bank moved its headquarters to 1 Wall Street in 1931, but the Woolworth Company (later Venator Group) continued to own the Woolworth Building for most of the 20th century. The structure was sold to the Witkoff Group in 1998. The top 30 floors were sold to a developer in 2012 and converted into residences. The remainder of the building remains in use by office and commercial tenants. The Woolworth Building has been a National Historic Landmark since 1966, and a New York City designated landmark since 1983. Design  The Woolworth Building was designed in the neo-Gothic style by Cass Gilbert. The building resembles European Gothic cathedrals, and Reverend S. Parkes Cadman dubbed it \\"The Cathedral of Commerce\\" in a booklet published in 1916. F. W. Woolworth, who had devised the idea for the Woolworth Building, had proposed to Gilbert that the Victoria Tower could be used as a model for the building. Gilbert, who disliked the comparison to religious imagery, ultimately used 15th- and 16th- century Gothic ornament on the Woolworth Building. The Woolworth Building was designed to be high but was eventually elevated to . The Woolworth Building was 60 stories tall when completed in 1913, though this consisted of 53 usable floors topped by several mechanical floors. It remained the tallest building in the world until the construction of 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building in 1930, also in New York City. = Form = The building's crown The building's tower, flush with the main frontage on Broadway, joins an office block base with a narrow interior court for light. The base's eastern boundary is on Broadway, and the building occupies the entire block between Park Place to the north and Barclay Street to the south. The base contains two \\"wings\\" extending westward, one each on the Park Place and Barclay Street frontages, which form a rough U-shape when combined with the Broadway frontage. This ensured that all offices had views outside. The U-shaped base is approximately 30 stories tall. The tower rises an additional 30 stories above the eastern side of the base, abutting Broadway. However, though the structure is physically 60 stories tall, the 53rd floor is the top floor that can be occupied. Above the 53rd floor, the tower tapers into a pyramidal roof. = Facade = Except for the lowest four floors, the exterior of the Woolworth Building was cast in limestone-colored, glazed architectural terracotta panels. The lowest floors are clad in limestone. F. W. Woolworth initially wanted to clad the skyscraper in granite, while Gilbert wanted to use limestone. The decision to use terracotta for the facade was based on both aesthetic and functional concerns. Not only was terracotta fireproof, Gilbert believed that terracotta would be a purely ornamental addition, clarifying the Woolworth Building's steel construction. The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company provided the original terracotta cladding. During construction, Gilbert requested that Atlantic Terra Cotta use an office adjacent to his own while it was drawing several hundred designs. He also asked that an outside firm, Donnelly and Ricci, create full-size designs based on Atlantic Terra Cotta's models. In 1932, Atlantic Terra Cotta carried out a comprehensive cleaning campaign of the Woolworth's facade to remove blackening caused by the soot and pollution of the city. The building's facade was again restored between 1977 and 1981 by the Ehrenkrantz Group. During the 1977‚Äì1981 renovation, much of the terracotta was replaced with concrete and Gothic ornament was removed. Some of the Woolworth Building's windows are set within arch-shaped openings. Most of the building's spandrels, or triangles between the top corners of the window and the top of the arch, have golden Gothic tracery against a bright blue backdrop. On the 25th, 39th, and 40th stories, the spandrels consist of iconography found in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Gold-on- blue tracery is also found on the 26th, 27th, and 42nd floors.  Base  On the part of the base facing Broadway, as well as the tower above it, there are three bays; the left and right bays have two windows per floor, while the center bay has three windows. The elevations facing Park Place and Barclay Street each have six bays with two windows per floor. The base, on its lowest four stories, is divided into three-story-high entrance and exit bays, each of which has a one-story attic above it. The main entrance on Broadway is a three-story Tudor arch, surrounded on either side by two bays: one narrower than the main arch, the other wider. The five bays form a triumphal arch overhung by a balcony and stone motifs of Gothic design. Inside the triumphal arch, there is a revolving door under a Tudor window, flanked by standard doors and framed with ornate decorations. Decorated revolving doors also exist at the northern and southern entrances, at Park Place and Barclay Street respectively. The Park Place and Barclay Street entrances are nearly identical to each other, except for the arrangement of the storefronts. Both entrances are located on the eastern sides of their respective elevations, lining up with the tower above them, and contain a wide arch flanked by two narrower arches. All three entrances feed into the lobby, or \\"arcade\\". The building's Park Place entrance contained a stair to the New York City Subway's Park Place station, served by the , inside the westernmost bay of the building entrance. There are horizontal belt courses placed above every five stories. The 27th floor contains terracotta ogee arches that project outward and act as a canopy. Above the 28th floor, the canopies are topped by a two-story-tall copper roof with complex tracery in the Gothic style. The 29th and 30th stories of the north and south wings are of similar depth to the six narrow bays on the Park Place and Barclay Street sides, but contain five bays. These wings are capped by a small tower with three bays.  Tower  The 30th floor contains setbacks on the Park Place and Barclay Street sides, though not on the Broadway side. Additional setbacks are located on the 45th and 50th floors. The 30th through 45th floors measure ; the 46th through 50th floors, ; and the 51st through 53rd floors, . The 30th through 45th floors contain three bays on each side; the side bays contain two windows while the center bay contains three windows. The 46th through 53rd floors also have three bays on each side, but the side bays only contain one window. At the 45th- and 50th- story setbacks, there are turrets at each corner of the tower. There is a pyramidal roof above the 53rd floor, as well as four ornamental tourelles at the four corners of the tower. The roof was originally gilt with gold, but is now green. It is interspersed with small dormers, which contain windows into the maintenance levels inside. The pyramidal roof is topped by another pyramid with an octagonal base and tall pointed-arch windows. The octagonal pyramid, in turn, is capped by a spire. The three layers of pyramids are about , or five stories tall. An observation deck was located at the 55th floor, about above ground level. It was patronized by an estimated 300,000 visitors per year, but was closed as a security measure in 1941 after the Pearl Harbor attack. = Structural features = Engineers Gunvald Aus and Kort Berle designed the steel frame, supported on massive caissons that penetrate to the bedrock. In order to give the structure a sturdy foundation, the builders used metal tubes in diameter filled with concrete. These tubes were driven into the ground with a pneumatic caisson process to anchor the foundations to the bedrock. The underlying bedrock is an average of deep, and the 69 caissons range in depth from . Because the slope of the bedrock was so sharp, steps had to be carved into the rock before the caissons could be sunk into the ground. The caissons were both round and rectangular, with the rectangular caissons being located mainly on the southern and western lot lines. Where the superstructure's columns did not match up with the caissons, they were cantilevered on plate girders above between two adjoining caissons. Each column carries a load of , supporting the building's overall weight of . For the wind bracing, the entire Woolworth Building was considered as a vertical cantilever, and correspondingly large girders and columns were used in the construction. Continuous portal bracing was used between the 1st and 28th floors, except in the interior columns, where triangular bracing was used. The portal braces on the building's exterior direct crosswinds downward toward the ground, rather than into the building. Interconnecting trusses were placed at five-floor intervals between the tower and the wings; these, as well as the side and court walls, provided the bracing for the wings. Above the 28th floor, knee braces and column-girder connections were used; hollow-tile floors were installed because it would have taken too long to set the concrete floors, especially during cold weather. The two basement levels used reinforced concrete. Strongly articulated piers, which carry right to the pyramidal cap without intermediate cornices, give the building its upward thrust. This was influenced by Aus's belief that, \\"From an engineering point of view, no structure is beautiful where the lines of strength are not apparent.\\" The copper roof is connected to the Woolworth Building's steel superstructure, which serves to electrically ground the roof. The Gothic detailing concentrated at the highly visible crown is over-scaled, and the building's silhouette could be made out from several miles away. Gilbert's choice of the Gothic style was described as \\"an expression of the verticality of the tower form\\", and as Gilbert himself later wrote, the style was \\"light, graceful, delicate and flame-like\\". When the Woolworth Building was being erected, Gilbert considered several proposals for exterior lighting to emphasize the structure's form and size. These included placing four powerful searchlights atop nearby buildings and a constantly rotating lamp at the apex of the Woolworth Building's roof. Ultimately, the builders decided to erect nitrogen lamps and reflectors above the 31st floor, and having the intensity of the lighting increase with height. = Interior = left At the time of construction, the Woolworth Building had over 2,000 offices. Each office had ceilings ranging from high. Gilbert had designed the interior to maximize the amount of usable office space, and correspondingly, minimize the amount of space taken up by the elevator shafts. The usable-space consideration affected the placement of the columns in the wings; the columns in the main tower were positioned according to the location of the elevator shafts and facade piers. Woolworth's private office on the 24th floor, revetted in marble in the French Empire style, is preserved in its original condition. The building has several thousand windows: the exact number is disputed, but various sources state that the Woolworth Building has 2,843, 4,400, or 5,000 windows. The inclusion of windows was for both lighting and comfort; because the Woolworth Building was built before air conditioning became common, every office is located within of a window. Upon completion, the Woolworth Building contained seven water systems, one each for the power plant, the hot-water plant, the fire- protection system, the communal restrooms, the offices with restrooms, the basement swimming pool, and the basement restaurant. There are water tanks on the 14th, 27th, 28th, 50th, and 53rd floors. Although the water is obtained from the New York City water supply system, much of it is filtered and reused. A dedicated water system, separate from the city's was proposed during construction, but workers abandoned the plan after unsuccessfully digging into Manhattan's bedrock. The Woolworth Building was the first structure to have its own power plant with four Corliss steam engine generators totaling a capacity of ; the plant could support 50,000 people. The building also had a dedicated heating plant with six boilers with a capacity of . The boilers were fed from subterranean coal bunkers capable of holding over 2,000 tons of anthracite coal.  Lobby  The ornate, cruciform lobby, known as the \\"arcade\\", has been described as being \\"cathedral-like\\" and lauded as \\"one of the most spectacular of the early 20th century in New York City\\". It consists of two 2-story-high passageways with barrel-vaulted ceilings. One passageway runs between the arcade's west wing at Woolworth Building's \\"staircase hall\\" and the east wing at Broadway. The other runs between the north wing at Park Place and the south wing at Barclay Street. A mezzanine crosses the arcade's north and south wings. Where the passageways intersect perpendicularly, there is a vaulted ceiling. The walls of this intersection vault are laid out in an octagonal shape, with mailboxes at the four \\"corners\\". Detail of grotesque The lobby is covered in veined marble from the island of Skyros in Greece. Edward F. Caldwell & Co. provided the interior lights for the lobby and hallways. The ceilings are decorated with patterned glass mosaics that contains blue, green, and gold tiling with red accents. There are other Gothic-style decorations in the lobby, including on the cornice and the bronze fittings. Several grotesques, depicting twelve people with a major role in the building's construction, are located at the intersection of the arcade and the mezzanine. These ornaments include Gilbert with a model of the building, Aus taking a girder's measurements, and Woolworth holding nickels and dimes. Two ceiling murals by C. Paul Jennewein, titled Labor and Commerce, are located above the mezzanine where it crosses the south and north wings, respectively. The staircase hall is a two-story room located to the west of the arcade. It consists of the ground level, which contains former storefronts, as well as a mezzanine level above it. A marble staircase leads westward from the arcade to a mezzanine, where the entrance to the Irving National Exchange Bank office was formerly located. The mezzanine contains a stained-glass skylight surrounded by the names of several nations, and contains the dates 1879 and 1913, which respectively signify the years of the Woolworth Company's founding and the building's opening. There is a smaller space west of the staircase hall with a one-story-high ceiling. This room contains a coffered ceiling with a blue-green background. The crossbeams contain Roman portrait heads, while the cornice contains generic sculpted grotesques. The lobby also contains a set of German chimes designed by Harry Yerkes.  Basement  The basement of the Woolworth Building contains an unused bank vault, restaurant, and barbershop. The bank vault was initially intended to be used as safe-deposit boxes, though it was used by the Irving National Exchange Bank in practice. In 1931, Irving moved some $3 billion of deposits to a vault in its new headquarters at 1 Wall Street, and the Woolworth Building's vault was converted into a storage area for maintenance workers. The basement also contains closed entrances to two New York City Subway stations. There was an entrance to the Park Place station directly adjacent to the building's north side, served by the . This entrance was closed after the September 11 attacks. Another entrance led to the City Hall station one block north, now served by the , but this was closed in 1982 due to concerns over crime. The area in front of the former entrances is now used to store bikes. A private pool, originally intended for F. W. Woolworth, exists in the basement. Proposed as early as 1910, the pool measured and was later drained. It was restored in the mid-2010s as part of the conversion of the Woolworth Building's upper floors into residential units.  Elevators  Detail of elevators The Woolworth Building contains a system of high-speed elevators capable of traveling per minute. The Otis Elevator Company supplied the units, which were innovative in that there were \\"express\\" elevators, stopping only at certain floors, and \\"local\\" elevators, stopping at every floor between a certain range. Upon the building's construction, there were 26 Otis electric elevators with gearless traction, as well as an electric-drum shuttle elevator within the tower. The elevators are accessed from bays in the eastern and western walls of the arcade. The walls are both divided by two bays with round arches, and there are four elevators on each wall. The elevator doors in the lobby were designed by Tiffany Studios. The patterns on the doors have been described as \\"arabesque tracery patterns in etched steel set off against a gold-plated background\\". History =Planning= F. W. Woolworth, an entrepreneur who had become successful because of his \\"Five-and-Dimes\\" (5- and 10-cent stores), began planning a new headquarters for the F. W. Woolworth Company in 1910. Around the same time, Woolworth's friend Lewis Pierson was having difficulty getting shareholder approval for the merger of his Irving National Bank and the rival New York Exchange Bank. Woolworth offered to acquire shares in New York Exchange Bank and vote in favor of the merger if Pierson agreed to move the combined banks' headquarters to a new building he was planning as F. W. Woolworth Company's headquarters. Having received commitment from the banks, Woolworth acquired a corner site on Broadway and Park Place in Lower Manhattan, opposite City Hall. The entrepreneur briefly considered purchasing a plot at West Broadway and Reade Street, a few blocks north of the Woolworth Building's current site, but decided against it due to the prestige that a Broadway address provided. Woolworth and the Irving National Exchange Bank then set up the Broadway-Park Place Company to construct and finance the proposed structure. Initially, the bank was supposed to gradually purchase the company's stock until it owned the entire company, and thus, the Woolworth Building. Irving would be able to manage the 18 floors of rentable space on a 25-year lease. While negotiations to create the Broadway-Park Place Company were ongoing, Woolworth and his real estate agent Edward J. Hogan purchased several parcels from the Trenor Luther Park Estate and other owners. The entirety of the current building's footprint, a rectangular lot, had been acquired by April 15, 1910, at a total cost of $1.65 million. alt= Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the new building. There are few print documents that indicate early correspondence between Woolworth and Gilbert, and news articles as late as March 1910 mentioned that no architect had been chosen. Gilbert later mentioned that he had received the commission for the Woolworth Building after getting a phone call from Woolworth one day. The architect had recently finished designing the nearby Broadway‚ÄìChambers Building and 90 West Street, and Woolworth admired the architecture of the latter. Woolworth also wanted his new structure to be of similar design to the Palace of Westminster in London, which was designed in the Gothic style. Gilbert was originally retained to design a standard 12- to 16-story commercial building for Woolworth, who later said he \\"had no desire to erect a monument that would cause posterity to remember me\\". However, Woolworth then desired to surpass the nearby New York World Building, which sat on the other side of City Hall Park and stood 20 stories and . A drawing by Thomas R. Johnson, dated April 22, 1910, shows a 30-story building rising from the site. Due to the change in plans, the organization of the Broadway-Park Place Company was rearranged. Woolworth would now be the major partner, contributing $1 million of the planned $1.5 million cost. The Irving Bank would pay the remainder, and it would take up a 25-year lease for the ground floor, fourth floor, and basement. By September 1910, Gilbert had designed an even taller structure, with a 40-story tower on Park Place adjacent to a shorter 25-story annex, yielding a -tall building. The next month, Gilbert's latest design had evolved into a 45-story tower roughly the height of the nearby Singer Building. After the latest design, Woolworth wrote to Gilbert in November 1910 and asked for the building's height to be increased to , which was taller than the Singer Building, Lower Manhattan's tallest building at the time. Woolworth was inspired by his travels in Europe, where he would constantly be asked about the Singer Building. He decided that housing his company in an even taller building would provide invaluable advertising for the F. W. Woolworth Company and make it renowned worldwide. This design, unveiled to the public the same month, was a 45-story tower rising , sitting on a lot by . Referring to the revised plans, Woolworth said, \\"I do not want a mere building. I want something that will be an ornament to the city.\\" He later said that he wanted visitors to be able to brag that they had visited the world's tallest building. Louis J. Horowitz, president of the building's main contractor Thompson-Starrett Company, said of Woolworth, \\"Beyond a doubt his ego was a thing of extraordinary size; whoever tried to find a reason for his tall building and did not take that fact into account would reach a false conclusion.\\" Even after the revised height was unveiled, Woolworth still yearned to make the building even taller as it was now close to the height of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, the tallest building in New York City and the world at the time. On December 20, 1910, Woolworth sent a team of surveyors to measure the Metropolitan Life Tower's height and come up with a precise measurement so he could make his skyscraper taller. He then ordered Gilbert to revise the building's design so as to reach , despite ongoing worries over whether the additional height would be worth the increased financial cost. In order to fit the larger base that a taller tower necessitated, Woolworth bought the remainder of the frontage on Broadway between Park Place and Barclay Street. Woolworth also acquired two lots to the west, one on Park Place and one on Barclay Street; these lots would not be developed, but would retain their low-rise buildings and preserve the proposed tower's views. Such a tall building would produce the largest income of any building globally. On January 1, 1911, the New York Times reported that Woolworth was planning a building at a cost of $5 million. By January 18, 1911, Woolworth and Hogan had acquired the final site for the project at a total cost of $4.5 million; the lot measured on Broadway, on Barclay Street, and on Park Place. In a New York Times article two days later, Woolworth said that his building would rise to its tip. In order to fit the correct architectural proportions, Gilbert redesigned the building to its current height. Renderings by illustrator Hughson Hawley, completed in April 1911, are the first official materials that reflect this final height. Gilbert had to reconcile both Woolworth's and Pierson's strict requirements for the design of the structure. The architect's notes describe late-night conversations that he had with both men. The current design of the lobby, with its arcade, reflected these conflicting pressures. Sometimes, Gilbert also faced practical conundrums, such as Woolworth's requirement that there be \\"many windows so divided that all of the offices should be well lighted\\", and so that tenants could erect partitions to fit their needs. Gilbert wrote that this \\"naturally prevented any broad wall space\\". Woolworth and Gilbert sometimes clashed during the design process, especially because of the constantly changing designs and the architect's fees. Gilbert nevertheless commended Woolworth's devotion to the details and beauty of the building's design, as well as the entrepreneur's enthusiasm for the project. Such was the scale of the building that, for several years, Gilbert's sense of scale was \\"destroyed [...] because of the unprecedented attuning of detail to, for these days, such an excessive height\\". =Construction= The Woolworth Building under construction in April 1912 In September 1910, wrecking crews demolished the five and six-story structures which previously occupied the site. Construction officially began on November 4, 1910 with excavation by The Foundation Company, using a contract negotiated personally by Frank Woolworth. The start of construction instantly raised the site's value from $2.25 million to $3.2 million. The contract of over $1 million was described as the largest contract for foundation construction ever awarded in the world. It took months for Woolworth to decide upon the general construction company. George A. Fuller's Fuller Company was well experienced and had practically invented skyscraper construction, but Louis Horowitz's Thompson-Starrett Company was local to New York; despite being newer, Horowitz had worked for Fuller before, so had a similar knowledge base. On April 20, 1911, Thompson-Starrett won the contract with a guaranteed construction price of $4,308,500 for the building's frame and structural elements. The company was also paid $300,000 for their oversight and management work, despite Woolworth's attempts to get the company to do the job for free due to the prestige of the project. The construction process involved hundreds of workers, and daily wages ranged from $1.50 for laborers () to $4.50 for skilled workers (). By August 1911, the building's foundations were complete ahead of the target date of September 15; construction of the skyscraper's steel frame began August 15. The steel beams and girders used in the framework weighed so much that, in order to prevent the streets from caving in, a group of surveyors examined the streets on the route along which the beams would be transported. Steel for the building was provided by the American Bridge Company from their foundries in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and took over 45 weeks to manufacture. alt= The first above- ground steel had been erected by October 1911, and installation of the building's terracotta began on February 1, 1912. The building rose at the rate of stories a week and the steelworkers set a speed record for assembling 1,153 tons of steel in six consecutive eight-hour days. By February 18, 1912, work on the steel frame had reached the building's 18th floor. By April 6, 1912, the steel frame had reached the top of the base at the 30th floor and work then commenced on constructing the tower of the Woolworth Building. Steel reached the 47th floor by May 30 and the official topping out ceremony took place two weeks ahead of schedule on July 1, 1912, as the last rivet was driven into the summit of the tower. The skyscraper was substantially completed by the end of that year. The building opened on April 24, 1913. Woolworth held a grand dinner on the building's 27th floor for over 900 guests, and at exactly 7:30 p.m. EST, President Woodrow Wilson pushed a button in Washington, D.C., to officially turn on the building's lights. Attendees included Francis Hopkinson Smith, who served as toastmaster; author William Winter; businessmen Patrick Francis Murphy and Charles M. Schwab; Rhode Island Governor Aram J. Pothier; Judge Thomas C. T. Crain; US Senator from Arkansas Joseph Taylor Robinson; Ecuadorian minister Gonzalo C√≥rdova; New York Supreme Court Justices Charles L. Guy and Edward Everett McCall; Commissioner of Education of the State of New York John Huston Finley; Collector of the Port of New York William Loeb Jr.; naval architect Lewis Nixon; Rear Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee; Commissioner of Docks and Ferries of the City of New York R. A. C. Smith; Colonel William Conant Church; United States Representative from New York Herman A. Metz; New York City Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo; banker James Speyer; former Lieutenant Governor of New York Timothy L. Woodruff; writer Robert Sterling Yard; Admiral Albert Gleaves; and reportedly between 69 and 80 congressmen who arrived via a special train from Washington, DC. Additional congratulations were sent via letter from former President William Howard Taft, Governor of New Jersey James Fairman Fielder, and United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. On completion, the Woolworth Building topped the record set by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower as the world's tallest building, a distinction it held until 1930. The final estimated construction cost was (), up from initial estimates of for the shorter versions of the skyscraper (). This was divided into $5 million for the land, $1 million for the foundation, and $7 million for the structure. Woolworth provided $5 million, while investors provided the remainder, and financing was completed by August 1911. By May 1914, Woolworth had purchased all of the Broadway-Park Place Company's shares from the Irving National Exchange Bank. However, though Woolworth owned the building, his company did not. =Opening and early years= Woolworth Building c.1913 The building was declared ready for occupancy on May 1, 1913, and Woolworth began advertising the offices for rent beginning at $4.00 per square foot. In order to attract tenants, Woolworth hired architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler to write a 56-page brochure outlining the features of the building. Schuyler later described the Woolworth Building as the \\"noblest offspring\\" of buildings erected with steel skeletons. By the end of 1914, the building was 70% occupied and generating over $1.3 million a year in rents for the F. W. Woolworth Company. By the 1920s, the building had more than a thousand different tenants, who generally occupied suites of one or two rooms. These tenants reportedly collectively employed over 12,000 people who worked within the building. In 1920, after F. W. Woolworth died, his heirs took out a $3 million mortgage loan on the Woolworth Building from Prudential Life Insurance Company to pay off $8 million in inheritance tax. By this point, the building was worth $10 million and grossed $1.55 million per year in rent income. The Broadway-Park Place Corporation sold the building to Woolco Realty Co., a subsidiary of the F. W. Woolworth Company, in April 1924 for $11 million. The company paid $4 million in cash and obtained a five-year, $11 million mortgage from Prudential Life Insurance Company at an annual interest rate of 5.5%. During World War I, only one of the Woolworth Building's then-14 elevators was turned on, and many lighting fixtures in hallways and offices were turned off. This resulted in about a 70% energy reduction compared to peacetime requirements. This policy was reinstated during World War II: ten of the building's 24 elevators were temporarily disabled in 1944 due to a shortage in coal. In 1927, the building's pinnacle was painted green and the observation tower was regilded in gold at a cost of over $25,000. The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company cleaned the Woolworth Building's facade in 1932. By 1953, a new chilled water air conditioning system had been installed, bringing individual room temperature control to a third of the building. Additionally, the old car-switch-control elevators had been replaced with a new automatic dispatching systems and new elevator cars. However, the building's terracotta facade deteriorated easily, and by 1962, repairs to the terracotta tiles were occurring year-round. = Restoration, landmark status, and sale = The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission considered giving the Woolworth Building official city-landmark status in 1970. The F. W. Woolworth Company called the landmark law as a whole \\"onerous\\" since it would restrict the company from making modifications to many aspects of the building. The commission ultimately declined to give the Woolworth Building a designated- landmark status because of the F. W. Woolworth Company's opposition to such a measure, as well as the increased costs and scrutiny. The F. W. Woolworth Company commissioned an appraisal of the building's facade in 1975 and found serious deterioration in the building's terracotta. Many of the blocks of terracotta had loosened or cracked from the constant thermal expansion and contraction caused by New York's climate. The cracks in the facade let in rain, which in turn caused the steel superstructure to rust. In 1977, the F. W. Woolworth Company began a five-year restoration of the building's terracotta and limestone facade, as well as replacement of all of the building's windows. Initially, the company had considered replacing the entire terracotta facade with concrete to prevent further deterioration, but backed away from the plan due to cost and potential backlash from preservationists. The renovation involved the replacement of roughly one-fifth of the building's terracotta surface. as well as all of the building's windows, by Turner Construction under a plan by the New York architectural firm Ehrenkrantz Group. Since terracotta had become rare in the 1970s, few manufacturers remained to supply replacement tiles, so the company replaced 26,000 of the tiles with concrete lookalikes; many of those tiles had to be custom-cut. The concrete was coated with a surface that was meant to be replaced at five-year intervals, a similar replacement cycle to the glaze on the terracotta blocks. Similarly, the original copper windows were replaced with aluminum frames which allowed them to be opened, whereas the originals were sealed in place. The company also removed some decorative flying buttresses near the tower's crown and refaced four tourelles in aluminum due to damage. The renovation was completed in 1982. When the work began it was expected to cost just $8 million, but the final cost was over $22 million. Much of the renovation was financed through an $11.4 million tax break from the New York City government. The same year the renovation was completed, the building's entrance to the City Hall subway station was closed due to fears over crime. A year later, in 1983, the Landmarks Preservation Commission revisited the building and granted landmark protection to its exterior and facade. The building was owned by the F. W. Woolworth Company (later Venator Group) until 1998. After struggling financially for years and with no need for a trophy office building, Venator Group began discussing a sale of the building in 1996. On April 28, 1998, the Venator Group announced plans to sell the building, and in June 1998, sold it to Steve Witkoff's Witkoff Group and to Lehman Brothers for $155 million. Along with the sale, the F. W. Woolworth Company shrunk its space in the building from eight floors to four; this was a sharp contrast to the 25 floors that the company had occupied at its peak. Witkoff also agreed to license the Woolworth name and invest $30 million in renovating the exterior and interior of the building. =Witkoff Group= The Woolworth Building, right, in 1985; the former World Trade Center can be seen at left After purchasing the building, the Witkoff Group rebranded it in an attempt to attract entertainment and technology companies. In April 2000, the Venator Group officially moved their headquarters out of the building to 112 West 34th Street. In October 2000, the company proposed a 2-story addition to the 29th- floor setbacks on the north and south sides of the tower, to be designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who were also leading the renovation of the building. However, the proposal was unanimously voted down by the Landmarks Preservation Commission. The company unveiled an ambitious plan in November 2000 that would have converted the top 27 floors of the building into 75 condominiums, including a 5-story penthouse. The plan also would have included a new residential lobby on Park Place, a 100-space garage, a 75-seat underground screening room, and a spa in the basement. The developers planned to spend $60 to $70 million on the conversion and to be ready for occupancy by August 2002. However, the Landmarks Preservation Commission opposed the plan because it would have required exterior changes to the roof. A version of the plan was eventually approved by the commission. Following the September 11 attacks, and the subsequent collapse of the nearby World Trade Center, the status of the plan was in doubt, and the proposal was later canceled. Prior to the September 11 attacks, the World Trade Center was often photographed in such a way that the Woolworth Building could be seen between the complex's twin towers. After the attacks occurred only a few blocks away, the Woolworth Building was without electricity, water and telephone service for a few weeks; its window was broken and a top turret was damaged due to falling rubble. Increased post-attack security restricted access to most of the ornate lobby, previously a tourist attraction. New York Times reporter David W. Dunlap wrote in 2006 that a security guard had asked him to leave within twelve seconds of entering the Woolworth Building. However, there was renewed interest in restoring public access to the Woolworth Building during planning for the building's centennial celebrations. The lobby reopened to public tours in 2014, when Woolworth Tours started accommodating groups for 30- to 90-minute tours. The tours were part of a partnership between Cass Gilbert's great- granddaughter, Helen Post Curry, and Witkoff's vice president for development, Roy A. Suskin. In June 2003, Credit Suisse First Boston provided $201 million in financing for the property spread across a $125.4 million senior loan, a $49.6 million junior interest and a $26 million mezzanine loan. In April 2005, Bank of America provided a $250 million commercial mortgage-backed security interest-only loan on the office portion of the building. At the time, the building was 96% occupied, appraised at $320 million, and generated almost $18 million a year in net operating income. By 2007, the concrete blocks on the Woolworth Building's facade had deteriorated because of neglect. A lack of regular re-surfacing had led to water and dirt absorption, which in turn stained the concrete blocks. Though terracotta's popularity had increased since the 1970s, Suskin had declined to say whether the facade would be modified, if at all. Around the same time, Witkoff planned to partner with Rubin Schron to create an ‚Äúoffice club‚Äù on the top 25 floors building to attract high-end tenants like hedge funds and private equity firms. The plan would have restored the 58th floor observatory as a private amenity for \\"office club\\" tenants, in addition to amenities such as a private dining room, meeting rooms, and a new dedicated lobby. The partners planned to complete the project by the end of 2008, but the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 derailed the plans, leaving the top floors gutted and vacant. =Residential conversion= On July 31, 2012, an investment group led by New York developer Alchemy Properties which included Adam Neumann and Joel Schreiber, bought the top 30 floors of the skyscraper for $68 million from the Witkoff Group and Cammeby's International. The firm planned to renovate the space into 33 luxury apartments and convert the penthouse into a five-level living space. The lower 28 floors are still owned by the Witkoff Group and Cammeby's International, who planned to maintain them as office space. The project was expected to cost approximately $150 million including the $68 million purchase price. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the changes to the building in October 2013. The renovation included many restorations and changes to the building's interior. Two of the elevator shafts only went to the 29th floor, allowing extra floor space for the residents above. A new private lobby was also built for residents and the coffered ceiling from F.W. Woolworth's personal 40th floor office was relocated to the entryway. The building's new interiors were designed by Thierry Despont and Eve Robinson with Miele appliances and custom cabinetry. Each unit also received space in a wine cellar, along with access to the restored private pool in the basement. The 29th floor was converted to an amenity floor named the \\"Gilbert Lounge\\" after the structure's architect, while the 30th floor hosts a fitness facility. In August 2014, the New York Attorney General's office approved Alchemy's plan to sell 34 condos at the newly branded Woolworth Tower Residences for a combined total of $443.7 million. The $110 million price tag for the building's penthouse unit is the highest asking price ever for an apartment in downtown Manhattan. If sold, the unit would surpass the record $50.9 million penthouse at Ralph Thomas Walker's Walker Tower, and even the $100.5 million record price for a Manhattan penthouse set by Michael Dell at Extell's One57 in 2014. After a soft launch in the fall of 2014, units at the building were officially listed for sale in summer 2015. Alchemy initially intended to leverage an in- house sales staff and hired a director from Corcoran Sunshine to lead the effort. However, the new sales director left at the end of 2015 for Extell Development Company amid rumors of slow sales at the project. Following his departure, the company hired Sotheby's International Realty to market the units. In June 2016, United Overseas Bank of Singapore provided a $220 million construction loan for the project. In 2015, The Blackstone Group provided a $320 million loan on the office portion of the building to refinance the maturing Bank of America loan from 2005. When the sale was first announced in 2012, the developers expected the building's conversion to be complete by 2015. However, construction of the conversion took longer than expected. Workers could not attach a construction hoist to the building's landmarked facade without damaging it, and they were prohibited from using the elevators due to both the active office tenants on the lower floors and the regular public tours of the landmarked lobby. As a result, the conversion was expected to be completed by February or March 2019, about six and a half years after Alchemy bought the property. By February 2019, only three of the building's 31 condos had been sold, since the developers had refused to discount prices, despite a glut of new luxury apartments in New York City. Tenants =Early tenants= Seen from the east At the building's completion, the F. W. Woolworth Company occupied only one and a half floors of the building. However, as the owner, the Woolworth Company profited from renting space out to others. The Woolworth Building was almost always fully occupied due to its central location in Lower Manhattan, as well as its direct connections to two subway stations. The Irving Trust Company occupied the first four floors upon the building's opening. It had a large banking room on the second floor accessible directly from a grand staircase in the lobby, vaults in the basement, offices on the third-floor mezzanine, and a board room on the fourth floor. In 1931, the company relocated their general, out-of-town, and foreign offices from the Woolworth Building after building their own headquarters at 1 Wall Street. Columbia Records was also one of the Woolworth Building's tenants at opening day, and housed a recording studio in the skyscraper. In 1917, Columbia made what are considered the first jazz recordings, by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, in this studio. Shortly after the building opened, it was used by several railroad companies. The Union Pacific Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad occupied the ground floor retail space to serve as ticket offices. Other railroad companies that leased office space included the Alton Railroad, on the 13th floor; the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad, on the 14th floor; the Canadian Pacific Railway, Great Northern Railway, and New York Central Railroad on the 15th floor; the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, on the 17th floor; the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, on the 19th floor; the Canadian Northern Railway; the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad; the Pennsylvania Railroad; the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway; the Kansas City Southern Railway; and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad. The inventor Nikola Tesla also occupied an office in the Woolworth Building starting in 1914; after a year, he was evicted because he could not pay his rent. Scientific American moved into the building in 1915 before departing for Midtown Manhattan in 1926. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America was present at the building's opening, occupying the southern half of the 18th floor after signing a lease in January 1913. Other early tenants included the American Hardware Manufacturers Association headquarters, the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, Colt's Manufacturing Company, Remington Arms, Simmons-Boardman Publishing headquarters, the Taft-Peirce Manufacturing Company, and the Hudson Motor Car Company. =Later 20th century= By the 1920s, the building also hosted Newport News Shipbuilding and Nestl√©. In the 1930s, prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey maintained his offices in the building while investigating racketeering and organized crime in Manhattan. His office took up the entire fourteenth floor and was heavily guarded. The regional headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board also moved into the building in 1937, shortly after its founding in 1935. During World War II, the Kellex Corporation, part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, was based here. During the early 1960s, public relations expert Howard J. Rubenstein opened an office in the building. In 1975, the city signed a lease for state judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg's offices in the Woolworth Building. =Higher education= The structure has a long association with higher education, housing a number of Fordham University schools in the early 20th century. In 1916, Fordham created \\"Fordham Downtown\\" at the Woolworth Building by moving the School of Sociology and Social Service and the School of Law to the building. The Fordham University Graduate School was founded on the building's 28th floor in the same year and a new Teachers‚Äô College quickly followed on the seventh floor. In September 1920, the Business School was also established on the seventh floor, originally as the School of Accounting. By 1929, the school's combined programs at the Woolworth Building had over 3,000 enrolled students. Between 1916 and 1943 the building was also home at various times to the Fordham College (Manhattan Division), a summer school, and the short-lived School of Irish Studies. In 1943, the Graduate School relocated to Keating Hall at Fordham's Rose Hill campus in Fordham, Bronx, and the rest of the schools moved to nearby 302 Broadway because of reduced attendance due to World War II. The New York University School of Professional Studies' Center for Global Affairs leased on the second, third, and fourth floors in 2002 from defunct dot-com startup FrontLine Capital Group. The American Institute of Graphic Arts also moved its headquarters in the Woolworth Building. =21st-century tenants= By the early 2000s, the Woolworth Building was home to numerous technology tenants. Digital advertising firm Xceed occupied across four floors as its headquarters, Organic, Inc. took , and advertising agency Fallon Worldwide used two floors. However, Xceed terminated its lease in April 2001 during the midst of the Dot- com bubble collapse in order to move to smaller offices in the Starrett‚ÄìLehigh Building. One month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's Northeast Regional Office at 7 World Trade Center was destroyed in the September 11 attacks, the Commission's 334 employees moved into across five floors of the Woolworth Building. The Commission left for a larger space in Brookfield Place less than four years later in 2005. The General Services Administration took over the Commission's space on November 1, 2005 and used it as offices for approximately 200 staff of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. Following the completion of renovations at the historic Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in late October 2017, both offices moved into newly vacated space in the nearby Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse. The New York City Police Department pension fund signed a lease for on the 19th and 25th floors in April 2002. The pension fund renewed their lease for another 20-year term in October 2010. Starbucks opened a location on the ground floor in the spring of 2003. In 2006, Levitz Furniture moved its headquarters to the 23rd floor of the building from Woodbury, Long Island after declaring bankruptcy a second time. The design firm Control Group Inc. also leased a whole floor of the Woolworth Building in 2006. , the Lawrence Group handles leasing at the Woolworth Building. In May 2013, SHoP Architects moved the company's headquarters to the building's entire 11th floor, occupying of space. In February 2016, the New York City Law Department leased the building's entire fifth floor for the Department's tort office. Joseph Altuzarra's namesake fashion brand, Altuzarra, signed on to occupy the 14th floor in June 2016. In November 2017, Thomas J. Watson's Watson Foundation signed a lease to relocate to the 27th floor of the building. In 2017, the New York Shipping Exchange moved into the 21st floor of the building. In May 2018, architecture and design firm CallisonRTKL signed a lease for the building's entire 16th floor. The Vera Institute of Justice left the building's 12th floor a few months later, moving into a larger space in Industry City, Brooklyn. Impact =In media= Woolworth Building June Night, 1916 lithograph by Rachael Robinson Elmer, National Gallery of Art The Woolworth Building has had a large impact in architectural spheres, and has been featured in many works of popular culture, including photographs, prints, films, and literature. Before beginning construction, Woolworth hired New York photographer Irving Underhill to document the construction of the building. These photographs were distributed to Woolworth's stores nationwide to generate enthusiasm for the project. During construction, Underhill, Wurts Brothers, and Tebbs-Hymans all took photographs to document the structure's progression. These photos were often taken from close-up views, or from far away to provide contrast against the surrounding structures. They were part of a media promotion for the Woolworth Building. The photos were criticized by both contemporary and modern figures as \\"'standard solutions' at best and 'architectural eye candy' at worst\\". However, it was largely effective: in a 2001 book about Cass Gilbert, Mary N. Woods writes that \\"the rich and varied afterlife of the Woolworth Building ... enhances [Gilbert's] accomplishment.\\" One of the earliest films to feature the skyscraper was the 1921 film Manhatta (1921), a short documentary film directed by painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. Since then, the building has made cameo appearances in several films: for instance, the 1929 film Applause. It was also the setting of several film climaxes, such as in Enchanted (2007), as well as used for the setting of major organizations, such as in Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them (2016). The Woolworth Building was also featured in the television show Ugly Betty as the ‚ÄòMeade Publications‚Äô building, a major location in the series. The Woolworth Building has also appeared in works of literature. In Langston Hughes's 1926 poem \\"Negro\\", the narrator had made mortar for the building. Additionally, in the novel Peak (2007), the protagonist is arrested for climbing the building. =Replicas= The Lincoln American Tower in Memphis, Tennessee, built in 1924, is a one-third-scale replica of the Woolworth Building.

(Ê†™Âºè‰ºöÁ§æ„É§„Ç™„Éè„É≥ Kabushiki gaisha Yaohan), or Yaohan (Japanese: „É§„Ç™„Éè„É≥ or ÂÖ´ÁôæÂçä; Chinese: ÂÖ´‰Ω∞‰º¥) was a Japanese retail group, founded in 1930 by Ryohei Wada (ÂíåÁî∞ ËâØÂπ≥ Wada Ry≈çhei) and his wife Katsu Wada (ÂíåÁî∞ „Ç´„ÉÑ Wada Katsu). Initially a single shop, it was expanded by their son Kazuo Wada into a major supermarket chain with most retail outlets located in Shizuoka prefecture, south of Tokyo. It was incorporated in 1948 and listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange. The store was far more established and notable outside Japan, due to restrictive laws in Japan that made it difficult to set up new businesses, such that by the time it opened its first store in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the company was already in a state of decline due to accumulated debts from over-expansion. Growth The Whampoa, a 110-meter-long shopping centre building that takes the form of a ship in Whampoa Garden, Hong Kong, housed a large Yaohan department store on its ground and basement levels from the 1980s to the late 1990s. Yaohan store in Little Tokyo, Alameda Street, Los Angeles, USA During the 1980s and 1990s, the Yaohan group expanded dramatically outside Japan, especially into Hong Kong (since 1984), China (since 1995) and the US. At its peak, it had 450 outlets in 16 countries, including 9 in Hong Kong, as well in S√£o Paulo, Sorocaba (inside highway bus depot), San Jos√©, Costa Rica, Los Angeles, Vancouver (Yaohan Centre), Honolulu, London, and San Jose, California. Yaohan's first American location, at Fresno, California, was opened in 1979 at Yaohan Plaza. Typical of large Japanese companies, new employees were required to go through induction training programs that, in the case of Yaohan, had a strong religious emphasis on the principles of Seicho-no-Ie. Employees also had to go through regular seminars on Seicho-no-Ie and were ultimately required to be members of Seicho- no-Ie. This was not without resistance from its employees. Although the company was less strict on seminar attendance and membership for employees of overseas branches, the same resistance persisted. =Hong Kong= The first Yaohan store was opened in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong in 1984. After that, Yaohan store grew quickly in Hong Kong and had opened nine stores, which include Tuen Mun Town Plaza, Whampoa Garden, Yuen Long, Ma On Shan, Tsuen Wan. All the stores were closed in 1997 due to the financial turmoil and the burst of the Japanese economy bubble. Then many stores were replaced by another Japanese department store chain, JUSCO (now called AEON). Yaohan is one of the listed companies in Hong Kong during 1986 to 1997. It has owned many companies, such as the Wonderful World of Whimsy, Millie, Santa Ana Bakery and some another fast-food restaurant. But many of them were closed later. =Macau= Yaohan store was established and opened in 1992 in Macau. It is the first and the only department store in Macau until now. It was renamed as New Yaohan after the bankruptcy of the original company, and the new company is operated by Yaohan International Company Limited. =Malaysia= The first Yaohan store was opened in The Mall, Kuala Lumpur in 1987. It was later followed by Centre Point, Kota Kinabalu, Plaza OUG at Taman OUG in Jalan Klang Lama, and KOMTAR, Penang. Later it opened in Terminal 1, Seremban in 1996 and Sunway Pyramid, Subang Jaya in September 1997. All former stores were replaced by Aktif Lifestyle Corporation Bhd. in January 1998 and later Parkson in 2004. =Singapore= Its first store to open in Singapore in 1974 at Plaza Singapura revolutionised the grocery shopping experience in Singapore, and it quickly became a household name. Other stores were also opened in Thomson Plaza (1979), Bukit Timah (1982), Jurong (1983), and Parkway Parade (1983).Siam Future : Seiyu Singapore posts first full-year net profit The Jurong store was closed in 1989, and a new store planned at the IMM Shopping Mall was due to open in 1990. The sixth store was supposed to open in Kovan Shopping Centre in 1993. When the last store to cease operations in 1997 exited Singapore from Thomson Plaza, its staff were visibly moved and some were in tears. Also in operation in Singapore since 1985 was the Yaohan Best chain (a joint venture with Best Denki), specializing in electronics, which first opened in Yaohan's store space. =Thailand= The first Yaohan store was opened in Thailand at Fortune Town, Ratchadaphisek Road, Bangkok in 1991. () Withdrew during the year 1997 =Indonesia= In 1992, Yaohan opened its first branch in Indonesia at Plaza Atrium, a shopping center in the Segitiga Senen superblock, Central Jakarta. Opening on 21 August 1992, the 3-storey store was 100% managed and owned by PT. Suryaraya Mantap Utama, being supported with a US$10 million investment from Yaohan International Company Limited, which also licensed branding, distribution, and basic training.YOEDHA, DHIA PREKASHA.

It has since been replaced by Matahari, a local department store chain. A few unrelated supermarkets under the name Macan Yaohan also opened since 1985 in Medan, although all locations had since closed in 2015. Decline Yaohan Centre in Richmond, BC When the company faced financial difficulties, it was split into two companies, one in Japan and with the overseas part headquartered in Hong Kong, in a bid to survive. The group was traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as Yaohan International Company Limited until 11 August 1998. Through a combination of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the stagnation of the Japanese retail market, however, the group declared bankruptcy with 161 billion yen of debts. It was the biggest postwar failure in Japan's retail sector at the time. The super-market chain asked for protection from creditors under Japan's Corporate Rehabilitation Law on 18 September 1997. Many outlets were closed. In March 2000, Yaohan in Japan was bought by √ÜON Group and changed its name to Maxvalu Tokai; most of the stores in Hong Kong were also overtaken by √ÜON and became JUSCO. Other stores in the US were bought by Mitsuwa, Maruwa, and Marukai, the latter two based in Los Angeles. Stores in Canada were bought by The President Group, a Taiwanese company. A former Yaohan department store in Macau is operating under the trading name New Yaohan (Êñ∞ÂÖ´‰Ω∞‰º¥), operated by Yaohan International Company Limited in Hong Kong which is owned by STDM (controlled by Stanley Ho) and no longer has a connection with the Wada family.

A UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, the island is about in area, and is reached by an 8-minute ferry ride from downtown Xiamen. Although only about 20,000 people live on the island, Gulangyu is a major domestic tourist destination, attracting more than 10 million visitors per year, and making it one of China's most visited tourist attractions. Gulangyu not only bans cars, but also bicycles. The only vehicles permitted are small electric buggies and electric government service vehicles. Visitors can reach Gulangyu by ferry from the ferry terminal in Xiamen. Local residents are allowed to use a shorter 5-minute ferry to/from the Lun Du Ferry Terminal. During the day (every 20 minutes, from 7:10 AM to 5:30 PM in Winter and Spring / from 7:10 AM to 6:30 PM in Summer and Autumn), tourists and non-locals take a 20-minute ferry ride from the Dongdu International Cruise Terminal to either San Qiu Tian Terminal or Nei Cuo Ao Terminal in Kulangsu Town. A ticket costs 35 CNY. After 6:00 PM, there is a more convenient ferry from Lundu Terminal 2, which drops off at San Qiu Tian Terminal in Kulangsu Town. That service runs all night, and also costs 35 CNY. Gulangyu Island is renowned for its beaches, winding lanes and rich architecture. The island is on China's list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a 5A tourist attraction by the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). It ranks at the top of the list of the ten most scenic areas in the province. Gulangyu covers an area of 1.91 square kilometres (0.74 sq mi), with a household population of 15,373. Administratively, the island constitutes the Gulangyu Subdistrict, part of Xiamen's Siming District. History Map including Gulangyu (labeled as KU- LANG HS√ú (KULANGSU) ) View of the International Settlement c. 1908 =The International Settlement= The Sikh police force For a time, Gulangyu had the peculiarity of having constituted the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the more celebrated International Settlement at Shanghai. Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China's loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China in May 1902.William C. Johnstone, International Relations: The Status of Foreign Concessions and Settlements in the Treaty Ports of China, The American Political Science Review, No. 5, October 1937, p. 943. Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to enjoy extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement. As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police. The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu. Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II. The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen. =People's Republic of China= After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003. In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River. Attractions Gulangyu Island Statue of Koxinga facing Xiamen Gulangyu Island Walking Map As a place of residence for Westerners during Xiamen's colonial past, Gulangyu is famous for its architecture and for hosting China's only piano museum, giving it the nickname of \\"Piano Island\\" or \\"The Town of Pianos\\" () or \\"The Island of Music\\" (). There are over 200 pianos on this island. The Chinese name also has musical roots, as ÈºìÊµ™ K√≥Õò-l≈çng which means drum waves so-called because of the sound generated by the ocean waves hitting the reefs. Â∂º s≈´ means \\"islet\\". In addition, there is a museum dedicated to Koxinga, H√°i-to√© S√®-k√†i () Marine World, a subtropical garden containing plants introduced by overseas Chinese, as well as Xiamen Museum, formerly the Eight Trigrams Tower (). The island of Gulangyu is a pedestrian- only destination, where the only vehicles on the islands are several fire trucks and electric tourist buggies. The narrow streets on the island, together with the architecture of various styles around the world, give the island a unique appearance. The site is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.

It is connected to the main island of Xiamen only by ferry. Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, thus providing an alternative to the frenetic Xiamen Island across the river, although the recent introduction of electric tourist buggies may be damaging the island's charm. Freight is pulled on wheeled wooden carts up the often steep lanes by strong teams of men.  Culture  The spread of Christianity in 1900s brought western music to the island. Churches and museums were built, and people enjoyed going to music halls to hear performances. Since then, the island's local cultural environment mingled with introduced foreign music and art, which is why the Gulangyu cultural scene differs from other parts of China.  Classical music  A number of China's most famous classical musicians come from Gulangyu, including the pianist Yin Chengzong, the violist Jing Yang, and the pianist Xu Feiping. Historically, Shu'an Zhou, Junji Lin, and Zuohuang Chen are other well-known classical musicians from the island. Gulangyu's piano ownership per capita ranks the first in nation, and by 2002, Gulangyu Island was given the name of \\"The Island of Music\\" by Chinese Musicians' Association. The piano exhibition halls and museums and overall artistic atmosphere attract many musicians domestically and internationally. The 580-seat Gulangyu Concert Hall is one of Fujian Province's most notable acoustic classical music venues. The classical violist Jing Yang is from Gulangyu, and also lives on the island.  Awards  In 2005, Gulangyu Island was named the most beautiful district of China by Chinese National Geography magazine. In May 2007, Xiamen Gulangyu Island was officially proved as the National 5A Tourist Attractions by the National Tourism Administration of China. On July 8, 2017, Gulangyu was listed as a World Heritage Site.

The Sunni Triangle is a densely populated region of Iraq to the north and west of Baghdad inhabited mostly by Sunni Muslim Arabs. The roughly triangular area's points are usually said to lie near Baghdad (the southeast point), Ramadi (the southwest point) and Tikrit (the north point). Each side is approximately 125 kilometers (80 miles) long. The area also contains the cities of Samarra and Fallujah. A 2003 CIA Factbook map which shows the area mostly inhabited by Sunni Muslim Arabs in light orange. The area was a center of strong support for former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's government; from the 1970s on, many government workers, politicians, and military leaders came from the area. Saddam was born just outside Tikrit. After the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the area became a focus of armed Sunni opposition to Coalition Provisional Authority rule. On December 13, 2003, Saddam Hussein was captured in a raid on the village of ad-Dawr about 15 km south of Tikrit. The term \\"Sunni triangle\\" was used intermittently from the 1970s among academic Iraq specialists, usually to differentiate it from Iraqi Kurdistan in the north and the Shia regions to the south. An early use in mainstream media is a San Francisco Chronicle article of September 14, 2002 in which former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter says: \\"We may be able to generate support for an invasion among some of the Shiites and some of the Kurds, but to get to Baghdad you must penetrate the Sunni Triangle.\\" However, it didn't come into widespread use until a New York Times article of June 10, 2003 popularised the term in a report on \\"a new U.S. effort to quell nascent armed resistance in Sunni Muslim-dominated areas north and west of Baghdad [in an] area known as the 'Sunni triangle'.\\" It became commonplace in reports on the US-led Multi-National Force ‚Äì Iraq's efforts to control the region. The lack of economic diversity within the region is a deterrent to Sunni separatism in Iraq as most of the oil reserves are in Kurdish and Shia regions, and the port cities of Basra and Umm Qasr are far away from the triangle. The \\"Sunni Triangle\\" is distinct from the Triangle of Death, a similarly Sunni area south of Baghdad which saw major combat activity in late 2004.

The scientific name Neofelis is a composite of the Greek word neo- (ŒΩŒµŒø-) meaning \\"new\\", and the Latin word feles meaning \\"cat\\", literally meaning \\"new cat\\".Perseus Digital Library. Greek Dictionary ŒΩŒµŒø Headword Search ResultPerseus Digital Library. Latin Dictionary feles Headword Search Result Taxonomic history The generic name Neofelis was first proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 as comprising two species; Neofelis macrocelis occurring in the Himalaya, Malacca, and Thailand, and Neofelis brachyurus occurring in the former Formosa.Gray, J.E. (1867). Notes on the skulls of the Cats. 5. Neofelis. Page 265‚Äì266 in: Proceedings of the Scientific Meetings of the Zoological Society of London for the year 1867. Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of Neofelis in 1917, but admitted only the single species Neofelis nebulosa with several subspecies and macrocelis as the type specimen.Pocock, R. I. (1917). \\"The classification of existing Felidae\\". The Annals and Magazine of Natural History: Including Zoology, Botany, and Geology, 8th ser. vol. 20 no. 119: 329‚Äì350. For almost 90 years, the classification of Neofelis as a monotypic genus was widely accepted. In 2006, Neofelis diardi was found to be distinct from its continental relative Neofelis nebulosa and classified as a separate species.  Characteristics  Formosan clouded leopard painted by Joseph Wolf in 1862. Gray described the genus Neofelis as having an elongate skull, a broad and rather produced face on the same plane as the forehead, a large and elongate nasal, a moderate orbit, a truncated lower jaw and very long conical upper and lower canine teeth with a sharp cutting hinder edge. This skull has resemblances to that of the fossil Smilodon, with very much elongated upper canines. Pocock described the skull of Neofelis as recalling in general features that of Panthera pardus, especially in the shortness and wide separation of the frontal and malar postorbital processes, relative proportion of mandibular teeth; but differing in the greater posterior width of the nasals, the thicker, more salient inferior edge of the orbit, and the mandible being greatly elevated anteriorly. The Sunda clouded leopard has longer upper canines and a narrower palate between them.  Distribution and habitat  Neofelis species range from Nepal and Sikkim eastward to south China and Hainan, southeastward to Myanmar, Annam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and Borneo. They are most closely associated with primary evergreen tropical rainforest, but make use of other types of habitat. Sightings have also been made in secondary and logged forest, as well as grassland and scrub. In the Himalayan foothills they have been recorded up to . = Distribution of species = Between 1821 and 1862, several felids have been described from Southeast Asia that are subordinated under Neofelis today: *Felis nebulosa was first described in 1821 by Edward Griffith based on a specimen brought from Canton in southern China. Populations range from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal through mainland Southeast Asia into China. *Felis diardi was first described in 1823 by Georges Cuvier based on a skin and a drawing received from Java. The Sunda clouded leopard is probably restricted to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. In Java only clouded leopard fossils were found. *Leopardus brachyurus was first described in 1862 by Robert Swinhoe based on two to three skins from Taiwan. Today the Formosan clouded leopard is considered a clouded leopard subspecies Neofelis nebulosa brachyurus. It is now considered to be extinct.  Threats  Deforestation is the foremost threat for both Neofelis species. They are also threatened by commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. Skins, claws and teeth are offered for decoration and clothing, bones and meat as substitute for tiger in traditional Asian medicines and tonics, and live animals for the pet trade. Few poaching incidents have been documented, but all range states are believed to have some degree of commercial poaching. In recent years, substantial domestic markets existed in Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam.Nowell, K. (2007). Asian big cat conservation and trade control in selected range States: evaluating implementation and effectiveness of CITES Recommendations. A TRAFFIC Report, June 2007  Conservation  Both Neofelis species are listed in CITES Appendix I and are protected over most of their range.

The original definition can be found in Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living (1st edition 1973, 2nd 1980):Maturana, Varela, 1980, p. 89. The term was introduced in 1972 by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self- maintaining chemistry of living cells. Since then the concept has been also applied to the fields of cognition, systems theory, architecture and sociology. Meaning Autopoiesis was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of living systems. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the biological cell. The eukaryotic cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as nucleic acids and proteins, and is organized into bounded structures such as the cell nucleus, various organelles, a cell membrane and cytoskeleton. These structures, based on an external flow of molecules and energy, produce the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components (not unlike a wave propagating through a medium). An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an allopoietic system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something other than itself (the factory). However, if the system is extended from the factory to include components in the factory's \\"environment\\", such as supply chains, plant / equipment, workers, dealerships, customers, contracts, competitors, cars, spare parts, and so on, then as a total viable system it could be considered to be autopoietic. Though others have often used the term as a synonym for self-organization, Maturana himself stated he would \\"[n]ever use the notion of self-organization ... Operationally it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing changes, the thing changes\\". Moreover, an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed, in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole. Autopoietic systems are \\"structurally coupled\\" with their medium, embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as sensory-motor coupling. This continuous dynamic is considered as a rudimentary form of knowledge or cognition and can be observed throughout life-forms. An application of the concept of autopoiesis to sociology can be found in Niklas Luhmann's Systems Theory, which was subsequently adapted by Bob Jessop in his studies of the capitalist state system. Marjatta Maula adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context. The theory of autopoiesis has also been applied in the context of legal systems by not only Niklas Luhmann, but also Gunther Teubner.For a discussion on the evolution and development of autopoietic legal systems, see, In the context of textual studies, Jerome McGann argues that texts are \\"autopoietic mechanisms operating as self-generating feedback systems that cannot be separated from those who manipulate and use them\\". Citing Maturana and Varela, he defines an autopoietic system as \\"a closed topological space that 'continuously generates and specifies its own organization through its operation as a system of production of its own components, and does this in an endless turnover of components, concluding that \\"Autopoietic systems are thus distinguished from allopoietic systems, which are Cartesian and which 'have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves. Coding and markup appear allopoietic\\", McGann argues, but are generative parts of the system they serve to maintain, and thus language and print or electronic technology are autopoietic systems. In his discussion of Hegel, the philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek argues, \\"Hegel is ‚Äì to use today's terms ‚Äì the ultimate thinker of autopoiesis, of the process of the emergence of necessary features out of chaotic contingency, the thinker of contingency's gradual self-organisation, of the gradual rise of order out of chaos.\\" Relation to complexity Autopoiesis can be defined as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment. Relation to cognition An extensive discussion of the connection of autopoiesis to cognition is provided by Thompson. The basic notion of autopoiesis as involving constructive interaction with the environment is extended to include cognition. Initially, Maturana defined cognition as behavior of an organism \\"with relevance to the maintenance of itself\\". However, computer models that are self-maintaining but non-cognitive have been devised, so some additional restrictions are needed, and the suggestion is that the maintenance process, to be cognitive, involves readjustment of the internal workings of the system in some metabolic process. On this basis it is claimed that autopoiesis is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cognition. Thompson (p. 127) takes the view that this distinction may or may not be fruitful, but what matters is that living systems involve autopoiesis and (if it is necessary to add this point) cognition as well. It can be noted that this definition of 'cognition' is restricted, and does not necessarily entail any awareness or consciousness by the living system. Relation to consciousness The connection of autopoiesis to cognition, or if necessary, of living systems to cognition, is an objective assessment ascertainable by observation of a living system. One question that arises is about the connection between cognition seen in this manner and consciousness. The separation of cognition and consciousness recognizes that the organism may be unaware of the substratum where decisions are made. What is the connection between these realms? Thompson refers to this issue as the \\"explanatory gap\\", and one aspect of it is the hard problem of consciousness, how and why we have qualia. A second question is whether autopoiesis can provide a bridge between these concepts. Thompson discusses this issue from the standpoint of enactivism. An autopoietic cell actively relates to its environment. Its sensory responses trigger motor behavior governed by autopoiesis, and this behavior (it is claimed) is a simplified version of a nervous system behavior. The further claim is that real-time interactions like this require attention, and an implication of attention is awareness. Criticism There are multiple criticisms of the use of the term in both its original context, as an attempt to define and explain the living, and its various expanded usages, such as applying it to self-organizing systems in general or social systems in particular. Critics have argued that the concept and its theory fail to define or explain living systems and that, because of the extreme language of self-referentiality it uses without any external reference, it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana's radical constructivist or solipsistic epistemology, or what Danilo Zolo has called instead a \\"desolate theology\\". An example is the assertion by Maturana and Varela that \\"We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist\\". The autopoietic model, said Rod Swenson, is \\"miraculously decoupled from the physical world by its progenitors ... (and thus) grounded on a solipsistic foundation that flies in the face of both common sense and scientific knowledge\\".

Career McClellan with President Bush as he announced his resignation as White House Press Secretary. McClellan graduated from Austin High School in 1986. He was a top ranked tennis player in high school and served as student council president. He later graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, where he was president of Sigma Phi Epsilon and a member of the tennis team in his early college years, with a B.A. in 1991.Scott McClellan - Profile at NNDB Retrieved 18.August 2013 He served as campaign manager for three of his mother's successful campaigns for statewide office. In addition, he worked on political grassroots efforts and was the Chief of Staff to a Texas State Senator.White House bio. McClellan waves farewell following his final press conference, May 5, 2006. Karen Hughes, then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush's communications director, hired McClellan to be Bush's deputy communications director. McClellan served as Bush's travelling press secretary during the 2000 Presidential election. McClellan became White House Deputy Press Secretary in 2001. McClellan replaced Ari Fleischer, who stepped down as White House Press Secretary on July 15, 2003. McClellan announced his resignation as Press Secretary on April 19, 2006 and was replaced with Tony Snow. Memoir and criticism of Bush administration McClellan criticized the Bush Administration in his 2008 memoir, What Happened. In the book, he accused Bush of \\"self-deception\\" and of maintaining a \\"permanent campaign approach\\" to governing rather than making the best choices. McClellan stopped short of saying that Bush purposely lied about his reasons for invading Iraq, writing that the administration was not \\"employing out-and-out deception\\" to make the case for war in 2002, though he did assert the administration relied on an aggressive \\"political propaganda campaign\\" to sell the Iraq War. His book was also critical of the press corps for being too accepting of the administration's perspective on the war and of Condoleezza Rice for being \\"too accommodating\\" and overly careful about protecting her own reputation. In a Washington Post article on June 1, 2008, McClellan said of Bush: \\"I still like and admire George W. Bush. I consider him a fundamentally decent person, and I do not believe he or his White House deliberately or consciously sought to deceive the American people.\\" Speaking frequently on the TV circuit, McClellan told Keith Olbermann in an interview on June 9, 2008, regarding the Iraq War planning: \\"I don't think there was a conspiracy theory there, some conspiracy to deliberately mislead. I don't want to imply a sinister intent. There might have been some individuals that knew more than others and tried to push things forward in a certain way, and that's something I can't speak to. I don't think that you had a bunch of people sitting around a room, planning and plotting in a sinister way. That's the point I make in the book. At the same time, whether or not it was sinister or not, it was very troubling that we went to war on this basis.\\" As a result of his assertions in his book, McClellan was invited to testify before the House Judiciary Committee. During the actual testimony McClellan said: \\"I do not think the president had any knowledge\\" [of the revelation of Valerie Plame Wilson's identity]; \\"In terms of the vice president, I do not know.\\" =Response to criticisms= The Bush administration responded through Press Secretary Dana Perino, who said, \\"Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House. We are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew.\\" Critics of McClellan's book included former White House staffers such as Karl Rove, Dan Bartlett, Ari Fleischer and Mary Matalin. Fleischer and Matalin have claimed that McClellan had not shared similar doubts during his tenure in the White House, and that if he had held such doubts then he ought not to have replaced Fleischer as Press Secretary. McClellan has responded by stating that he, like many other Americans, was inclined to give the administration the \\"benefit of the doubt\\" on the necessity of the Iraq War, and did not fully appreciate the circumstances until after leaving the \\"White House bubble\\". On May 28, 2008, The O'Reilly Factor host Bill O'Reilly presented a clip from an interview with Fleischer, who suggested that the book was heavily influenced by the publisher's editor. In a subsequent interview on The O'Reilly Factor days later, McClellan told O'Reilly that was not true. McClellan further testified under oath before the House Judiciary Committee that Fleischer's assertion was false. McClellan stated on MSNBC's Countdown with Keith Olbermann that \\"everything in the book is a clear reflection of my views and everything in the book is mine.\\" 2008 election cycle McClellan endorsed Barack Obama for president on CNN's D.L.

This is distinct from passive headphones which, if they reduce ambient sounds at all, use techniques such as soundproofing. Noise cancellation makes it possible to listen to audio content without raising the volume excessively. It can also help a passenger sleep in a noisy vehicle such as an airliner. In the aviation environment, noise-cancelling headphones increase the signal-to-noise ratio significantly more than passive noise attenuating headphones or no headphones, making hearing important information such as safety announcements easier. Noise-cancelling headphones can improve listening enough to completely offset the effect of a distracting concurrent activity.. Recognition and recall of audio information improved when 65 dB(A) background noise was blocked by noise-cancelling headphones, and performance was \\"no different\\" when listening with the headphones while at the same time working a mathematical puzzle, than while trying to listen to the same audio with neither puzzle nor headphones. Theory To cancel the lower-frequency portions of the noise, noise-cancelling headphones use active noise control or ANC. A microphone captures the targeted ambient sounds and a small amplifier generates sound waves that are exactly out of phase with the undesired sounds. When the sound pressure of the noise wave is high, the cancelling wave is low (and vice versa). The opposite sound waves collide and are eliminated or \\"cancelled\\". Cancellation focuses on constant droning sounds like road noise and is less effective on short/sharp sounds like voices or breaking glass. It also is ineffective in eliminating higher frequency noises like the sound of spraying. Noise-cancelling headphones often combine sound isolation with ANC to maximize the sound reduction across the frequency spectrum. Noise cancellation can also be used without sound isolation to make voices, etc. easier to hear. Noise cancellation to eliminate ambient noise is never passive because of the circuitry required, so references to passive noise cancellation actually are referring to products featuring sound isolation. The Bose QuietComfort headphones feature both passive noise isolation (big padded earcups) and active noise cancellation (ANC circuitry). Most noise-cancelling headsets in the consumer market generate the noise-cancelling waveform in real-time with analogue technology. In contrast, other active noise and vibration control products use soft real-time digital processing. To prevent higher-frequency noise from reaching the ear, most noise-cancelling headphones depend on sound isolation or soundproofing. Higher-frequency sound has a shorter wavelength, and cancelling this sound would require locating devices to detect and counteract it closer to the listener's eardrum than is currently technically feasible or would require digital algorithms that would complicate the headphone's electronics.Reinhard Lerch, Gerhard Sessler, Dietrich Wolf: Technische Akustik: Grundlagen und Anwendungen, Kapitel 14.7.3 Kopfh√∂rer ‚Äì H√∂rertypen, Verlag Springer (2008), , Seite 431 Noise-cancelling headphones specify the amount of noise they can cancel in terms of decibels. This number may be useful for comparing products but does not tell the whole story, as it does not specify noise reduction at various frequencies.  In aviation  By the 1950s, Dr. Lawrence Jerome Fogel created systems and submitted patents about active noise cancellation specifically in the field of aviation. This system was designed to reduce noise for the pilots in the cockpit area and help make their communication easier and protect hearing. Fogel was considered to be the inventor of active noise cancellation and he designed one of the first noise cancelling headphones systems. Later on, Willard Meeker designed an active noise control model that was applied to circumaural earmuffs for advanced hearing protection. Noise-cancelling aviation headsets are now commonly available. A number of airlines provide noise-cancelling headphones in their business and first class cabins. Noise cancelling is particularly effective against aircraft engine noise. In these cases, the headphones are about the same size as normal headphones. The electronics, located in the plane hand rest, take the sound from the microphone behind the headphone, invert it, and add it back into the audio signal, which reduces background noise.  As a sleeping aid  Over the last few years, the use of noise- cancellation headphones as sleeping aids has increased. Both passive isolating and active noise-cancellation headphones / ear plugs help to achieve a reduction of ambient sounds, which is particularly helpful for people suffering from insomnia or other sleeping disorders, for whom sounds such as cars honking and snoring impact their ability to sleep. For that reason, noise-cancelling sleep headphones and ear plugs are designed to cater to this segment of patients. Drawbacks Noise-cancelling headphones have the following drawbacks: *They typically cost more than regular headphones. *Active noise control requires power, usually supplied by a USB port or a battery that must occasionally be replaced or recharged. Without power, some models do not even function as regular headphones. *Any battery and additional electronics may increase the size and weight of the headphones compared to regular headphones. *The noise-cancelling circuitry may reduce audio quality and add high-frequency hiss, although reducing the noise may result in higher perceived audio quality.

Route 324 was a former alignment of US 322 that served the Bridgeport-Chester ferry between Bridgeport, New Jersey, and Chester, Pennsylvania. The ferry first ran on July 1, 1930, with US 322 being designated along the ferry and its access road in 1936 from Pennsylvania. The highway and ferry also shared the co-designation of State Highway Route S-44, a spur off State Highway Route 44 in Bridgeport. Route S-44 was decommissioned in the state highway renumbering while US 322 remained intact until the opening of the Commodore Barry Bridge in February 1974. The ferry made its last run at 8 p.m. on February 1, and closed down for good. US 322 was realigned onto the Commodore Barry Bridge while the former ferry alignment became Route 324\\\\.

Route 324 heads eastward along Old Ferry Road, a two-lane concrete roadway surrounded by trees and fields. The two-lane concrete highway remains such for a distance, paralleling US 322 to the south, passing a business. The route heads to the east, crossing south of a pond and intersecting with Springer Lane and a dirt road in Logan Township. The entire section west of Springer Lane is marked with a \\"Road Closed\\" sign, with minimal maintenance, multiple large potholes, and overgrown vegetation crowding the roadway. At Springer Lane, which is a former alignment of Route 44, the regularly maintained section of Route 324 begins. The road is now in an open area, crossing under power lines and intersecting with former alignments of roadway, overgrown with grass. A short distance from Springers Lane, the highway continues to the only other intersection along the route, which is for Island Road, a connector to U.S. Route 130\\\\. The highway, however, continues through the desolate portions of Logan Township along a power line. A short distance later, the route passes to the south of the only development along the highway, a boat marina and two homes. Route 324 continues as a two-lane concrete road eastward until reaching a cul-de-sac just short of the U.S. Route 130/U.S. Route 322 interchange in Logan Township, where the designation ends. History US 322 between the ferry and US 130/SHR 44 was State Highway Route S-44 until 1953 The ferry route that Route 324 serviced first made its crossings of the Delaware River on July 1, 1930, from Chester, Pennsylvania, to Bridgeport, New Jersey. The ferry service was run with two boats, Chester, a large boat with a capacity of 60 motor vehicles, and Bridgeport, a smaller boat with a capacity of 48. The ferry system was seen as an advantage across the Delaware, providing drivers a backup from the few bridges that existed along the river. In 1936, the Bridgeport‚ÄìChester Ferry was granted the alignment for the extension of U.S. Route 322 from Pennsylvania and into New Jersey. Along with the U.S. Route 322 designation, the New Jersey State Highway Department designated the alignment of Route 322 from the ferry to U.S. Route 130, then designated as State Highway Route 44, as State Highway Route S-44.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1939, compiled. The former site of the Chester‚ÄìBridgeport ferry in Bridgeport, as seen from the terminus of Route 324 Route 322 survived the state highway renumbering because of the fact that it was a U.S. Route. However, the co- designation on the ferry stretch, State Highway Route S-44 was decommissioned in favor of just one designation.Wikisource:1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering U.S. Route 322 remained on the ferry route for several years, and plans arose during the 1960s to construct a new bridge between the Delaware Memorial and Walt Whitman bridges. Construction began that year, and on February 1, 1974, the newly named Commodore Barry Bridge opened for traffic. At 8 p.m. that evening, the Bridgeport‚ÄìChester Ferry ran its final boat ride across the Delaware, and the service was closed down for good. The alignment of U.S. Route 322 was moved onto the Commodore Barry Bridge, while the former alignment was redesignated Route 324\\\\.

It is a bypass of Route 47 in Dennis Township, Cape May County and Maurice River Township, Cumberland County that is long and is completely county-maintained. Route 347 passes through dense woodland for most of its route as a two-lane undivided road. The road is a part of a major route linking the Philadelphia area with the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County. The route was created in the 1990s to replace Route 47 Alternate. It has been considered that Route 347 may be partially used for a potential future extension of Route 55, with improvements to the road planned. Route description Route 347's northern end at Route 47 in Maurice River Township Route 347 begins at an intersection with Route 47 in Dennis Township, Cape May County, heading to the northwest on a two-lane undivided road that is county- maintained. After passing a few residences, the road continues into dense woodland. The route passes by East Creek Pond before entering Maurice River Township in Cumberland County. After the county line, Route 347 intersects CR 550 Spur and forms a concurrency as it runs by West Creek Pond. Past the pond, CR 550 Spur splits from the road, which continues west-northwest. At the junction with CR 679, Route 347 turns to the northwest and comes to a crossroads with CR 550. The road remains on its northwest trajectory as it comes to the eastern terminus of CR 670. At this intersection, the northbound direction of Route 47 turns onto Route 347 from CR 670. Route 347 ends at the point where the ramp to southbound Route 47 splits from the road, which continues north as Route 47. Route 347, along with Route 47 and Route 55, constitutes a major route connecting the Philadelphia area to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County, with Route 347 serving as a bypass of a section of Route 47. The route is also part of a hurricane evacuation route for Cape May County in which contraflow lane reversal can be used for a quicker evacuation. History The beginning of Route 347 heading southbound at Route 47 in Maurice River TownshipWhat is now Route 347 was originally an unnumbered local road connecting to Route 47 at both ends. Route 347 was created in the 1990s, replacing what was originally designated as Route 47 Alternate. A third lane is currently being proposed along Route 347 in order to handle additional traffic at peak times in the summer season. Either a reversible lane or extra shoulder space is being considered for the additional lane. Originally, the route was to be widened to four total lanes. Auxiliary lanes are also planned to be built at the southern terminus with Route 47 in Dennis Township and the Route 47/CR 670 junction in Maurice River Township in order to alleviate traffic. The Route 347 corridor, along with a part of Route 47, is being considered for a southern expansion of Route 55 to the Garden State Parkway in Cape May County.

He founded Giordano, an Asian clothing retailer, Next Digital (formerly Next Media), a Hong Kong-listed media company, and the popular newspaper Apple Daily. He is one of the main contributors to the pro-democracy camp, especially to the Democratic Party. Although he is known as a Hong Kong political figure, he has been a UK national since 1996 A prominent critic of the PRC government, Lai was arrested on 10 August 2020 by the Hong Kong police on \\"charges of violating the territory's new national security law\\", an action which prompted widespread criticism. Early life Lai was born in Guangzhou, China in December 1948. At the age of 12, he entered Hong Kong as a stowaway on a boat. Upon his arrival, Lai began work as a child labourer in a garment factory for a wage of the equivalent of US$8 per month. Founding of Giordano Lai's factory work saw him rise to the position of factory manager. In 1975, Lai used his year-end bonus on Hong Kong stocks to raise cash and bought a bankrupt garment factory, Comitex, where he began producing sweaters. Customers included J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, and other U.S. retailers. By rewarding sellers with financial incentives in Hong Kong, he built the chain into an Asia-wide retailer. Giordano was said to have more than 8,000 employees in 2,400 shops in 30 countries. Lai has kept Comitex active as a shell company since he left the garment industry for media and politics in the 1990s. After his arrest under National Security Law on August 2020, Lai tried to sell his asset in Hong Kong, including the entire floor of Tai Ping Industrial Centre. The current owner of the property is Comitex Knitters Ltd. Comitex, along with other private companies controlled by Lai was reported to be the financial tools for his political activities and donations. Publications Lai pioneered a reader-centric philosophy with paparazzi journalism in Hong Kong based on publications such as USA Today and The Sun. His best-selling Next Magazine and Apple Daily newspaper, featured a mix of racy tabloid material and news items oriented to the mass market with plenty of colour and graphics that attracts a wide range of readers, some of whom are also critics of Lai and his ideology. = Hong Kong publications = Owing to the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Lai became an advocate of democracy and critic of the People's Republic of China government. He began publishing Next Magazine, which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting. He proceeded to found other magazines, including Sudden Weekly (ÂøΩÁÑ∂‰∏ÄÈÄ±), Eat & Travel Weekly (È£≤È£üÁî∑Â•≥), Trading Express/Auto Express (‰∫§ÊòìÈÄö/ÊêµËªäÂø´Á∑ö) and the youth-oriented Easy Finder (Â£πÊú¨‰æøÂà©). In 1995, as the Hong Kong handover approached, Lai founded Apple Daily, a newspaper start-up that he financed with $100 million of his own money. The newspaper's circulation rose to 400,000 copies by 1997, which was the territory's second largest among 60 other newspapers. According to Lai, he aspired to maintain freedom of speech in Hong Kong through Apple Daily. In addition to promoting democracy, Lai's publications often ruffled feathers of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government. In 2003, ahead of the record-breaking pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during July, the cover of Next Magazine featured a photo-montage of the territory's embattled chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa taking a pie in the face. The magazine urged readers to take to the streets while Apple Daily distributed stickers calling for Tung to resign. In 2006, Sudden Weekly and Next Magazine ranked first and second in circulation for Hong Kong's magazine market. Apple Daily became the No. 2 newspaper in Hong Kong. In 2020, Lai launched an English version of Apple Daily. However Next Digital, the list company, has struggled with huge financial deficit for years. The stock price has been hovering between HK$0.1 and HK$0.5, less than US$0.05 in the past five years (2015-2020). The cumulative losses in the past five years exceed HK$1.9 billion. = Taiwan publications = Lai launched Taiwanese editions of Next Magazine in 2001 and Apple Daily in 2003, taking on heavily established rivals who made considerable effort to thwart him. Rival publishers pressed advertisers to boycott and distributors not to undertake home delivery. His Taiwan offices were vandalised on numerous occasions. As the publications grew to have the largest readership in their category, the advertising boycotts ended. In October 2006, Lai launched Sharp Daily (Shuang Bao in Mandarin), a free daily newspaper targeting Taipei commuters. The company also launched Me! Magazine in Taiwan. In building Taiwan's most popular newspaper, Apple Daily, and magazine, Next Magazine, Lai's racy publications were described as having a great impact on the country's hitherto staid media culture. = Publication challenges = Lai's publications remained banned in China since their inception. The ban originated from Lai's 1994 newspaper column, where he told Premier of the PRC Li Peng, seen as a driving force behind the Tiananmen Square crackdown, to \\"drop dead\\". He also called the Communist Party of China \\"a monopoly that charges a premium for lousy service\\". China's government retaliated against Lai by starting a shut-down of Giordano shops, prompting him to sell out of the company in order to save it. In addition to having his publications banned in China, businesses had distanced themselves from placing advertisements in Apple Daily to avoid retaliation from the Chinese government. Lai had frequently faced hostility from the many Beijing-backed tycoons, including attempts to force supplier boycotts of his companies. Major Hong Kong property developers and top companies advertised only in competing publications not owned by Lai. He also faced a lengthy battle to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which Lai sidestepped through a reverse takeover. He managed to list the company in 1999 by acquiring Paramount Publishing Group in October of that year. Other companies During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, Lai started an Internet-based grocery retailer that offered home delivery services, adMart. The business expanded its product scope beyond groceries to include electronics and office supplies, but was shut down after losing between $100 and $150 million. Lai attributed this business failure to overconfidence and a lack of viable business strategy. In 2011, Next Media reportedly sold 70 per cent stake of Next Media's subsidiary Colored World Holdings (CWH, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands) to Sum Tat Ventures (STV, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands), a private company 100 per cent owned by Jimmy Lai. CWH was estimated to have net asset value of US$6.1 million. STV paid US$100 million in cash for 70 per cent stake of CWH. In 2013, STV paid another US$20 million for the remaining 30 per cent stake of CWH. CWH itself had its assets sold in 2011, and ceased operation in 2011. In total, STV paid US$120 million in cash for CWH. On Lai's Form 3B disclosure form, STV is listed as having the same correspondence address as Next Media in Hong Kong. Near the end of 2013, Lai spent approximately US$73 million (or NT$2.3 billion) to purchase a 2 per cent stake (~17 million shares) in Taiwanese electronics manufacturer HTC.  Activities in Myanmar In 2014, leaked documents showed Jimmy Lai paid former US deputy defence secretary and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz US$75,000 for his help with projects in Myanmar. Lai also reportedly remitted approximately US$213,000 to businessman Phone Win, with whom Lai's Hong Kong-registered Best Combo company reportedly collaborated on Yangon real estate projects. Political activity in Hong Kong Lai and Martin Lee at 1 July marches, 2013 Lai is a longtime champion of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. According to Lai, The Road to Serfdom by Friedrich Hayek inspired him to fight for freedom. His advocacy had been expressed through his business ventures, such as distributing Giordano t-shirts with portraits of student leaders. His high-profile support for the pro-democracy movements came under strong condemnation from the Chinese government. On 13 December 2014, Lai was one of the pro-democracy leaders arrested during the clearance of the Admiralty protest site of the Umbrella Movement. On the following day, Lai announced he would step down as head of Next Media \\"to spend more time with his family and further pursue his personal interests.\\" Lai had been the target of hostile attacks and disturbances, including the leaving of machetes, axes and threatening messages in his driveway. He had been rammed by a car, and his home was firebombed several times, most recently in 2019. Next Media spokesman Mark Simon condemned these attacks and stated, \\"This is a continual effort to intimidate the press in Hong Kong. This is raw and pure intimidation.\\" Some activists felt that the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong government, which have been Chinese-controlled since the handover in 1997, did not always follow up on these misconducts against Lai, and that culprits are rarely found. During the early hours of 12 January 2015, two masked men hurled petrol bombs at Lai's home on Kadoorie Avenue in Kowloon Tong. At the same time, a petrol bomb was thrown at the Next Media headquarters in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. The fires were extinguished by security guards. The perpetrators fled and two cars used in the attacks were found torched in Shek Kip Mei and Cheung Sha Wan. The crimes were denounced as an \\"attack on press freedom\\". On 28 February 2020, Lai was arrested for illegal assembly during his attendance in the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests, and for allegedly intimidating an Oriental Daily reporter after the reporter took photos of him in 2017. His case was scheduled to be heard at Eastern Law Court on 5 May. On 18 April 2020, Lai was among 15 high-profile democracy figures arrested in Hong Kong. According to a police statement, his arrest was based on suspicion of organising, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019. On 3 September 2020, Lai was found not guilty of the Oriental Daily criminal intimidation charge. National security law and arrest Next Digital offices, raided by police on 10 August 2020 On 30 June 2020, the Hong Kong national security law was enacted by China's parliament, by-passing the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Before the law was enacted, Lai called it \\"a death knell for Hong Kong\\" and alleged that it would destroy the territory's rule of law. On 10 August 2020, Lai was arrested at his home for alleged collusion with foreign forces (a crime under the new national security law) as well as fraud. Other Next Digital staff were also arrested, and police searched the home of both Lai and his son. Later in the morning, approximately 200 Hong Kong police officers raided the offices of Apple Daily in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate, seizing around 25 boxes of materials. After Lai was arrested, the stock price of Next Digital rose as high as 331 per cent on Tuesday. Bail was set at HK$300,000 (approx. US$38,705), with a surety of HK$200,000 (approx. US$25,803). Apple Daily said that more than 500,000 copies of its subsequent day's paper were printed, five times the usual number. The front page of Apple Daily showed an image of Mr Lai in handcuffs with the headline: \\"Apple Daily must fight on. The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, an agency of mainland China, welcomed the arrest and called for Lai to be severely punished. However, the day's events were widely viewed as an attack on the free press. The Hong Kong Journalists Association described the raid as \\"horrendous\\" and unprecedented in Hong Kong. The Democratic Party accused the government of trying to create a chilling effect in the Hong Kong media industry. Former governor Chris Patten called the events \\"the most outrageous assault yet\\" on Hong Kong's press. The head of the University of Hong Kong journalism department called the raid an \\"outrageous, shameful attack on press freedom\\". Other pro-democracy figures were arrested for national security crimes on the same day, including Agnes Chow, Wilson Li, and Andy Li, and at least four others.

It is an eastward extension into New Jersey of the longer Pennsylvania Route 413 (PA 413). The western terminus in the middle of the Burlington‚ÄìBristol Bridge crossing of the Delaware River at the New Jersey-Pennsylvania state border; the eastern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and County Route 543 (CR 543). Despite the east- west orientation, Route 413 runs north-south, but PA 413 is signed north- south. Prior to the 1953 renumbering, Route 413 was Route S25, a prefixed spur of Route 25. Route description Sign for Route 413 on the jughandle ramp from Route 130 northbound in Burlington Route 413 begins at the state line, midway along the Burlington-Bristol Bridge, as a continuation of PA 413\\\\. As the road descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans the width of the road though a toll is only collected for westbound traffic. The highway heads southward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. South of here, an oblong traffic circle, bisected by a grade crossing of NJ Transit's River Line light rail, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street. South of here, Route 413 continues as a divided highway with one lane in each direction passing through an area of commercial businesses. The road comes to another oblong traffic circle, with intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. One house and two businesses are located along the eastern edge of the circle. South of this circle, Route 413 ends at a complex intersection with US 130 (on which CR 543 runs concurrently), Taylor Avenue, Salem Road, and Mott Avenue. History In the 1927 renumbering of highways in New Jersey, US 130 was assigned as a part of New Jersey State Highway Route 25, which made up US 1 and US 9 as well. During that renumbering in 1927, Route 413 was originally New Jersey State Highway Route S-25, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 25. The highway remained intact along its alignment in Keim Road to the Burlington-Bristol Bridge until January 1, 1953.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department performed a second renumbering of state highways. State Highway Route 25, which had run at the southern terminus with Route 130, was decommissioned for the sole designation. Since State Highway Route 25 was decommissioned, State Highway Route S-25 would be orphaned and was decommissioned that day. The Highway Department renumbered S-25's alignment to Route 413, which continued as PA 413.

Subdivisions include Next Media Interactive. The corporation is known for introducing tabloid-style journalism into Hong Kong and Taiwan that set trends in both markets. Apple Daily was the first newspaper to use the massive graphics, bold headlines and full colour pages now common to all best-selling papers in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Starting from 20 October 2015, the English name of the company has been changed from Next Media Limited to Next Digital Limited.  Political position  Next Media publications are also known for highly sensationalised articles which attract a wide range of readers, including critics. Next Media has often taken a clear and sometimes proactive support for pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong. Some companies with ties to China never advertise in any papers or magazines owned by Next Media.  Controversy  The bold style of journalism seems to trigger constant troubles with the triads with incidents of criminal damages at the offices of Next Media. Apple Daily and its parent company Next Media are thought to be pioneer of paparazzi and yellow journalism in Hong Kong. A notable incident happened in 2006 when Gillian Chung, a member of singing group Twins, was shot changing clothes at the backstage by spy camera installed by a subsidiary magazine of Next Media. The case triggered debated over paparazzi acts in Hong Kong and regulation of paparazzi was considered.  Key people arrested  On the 10th August 2020, the founder of Next Digital which owns Apple Daily, Jimmy Lai was arrested by Hong Kong Police on early monday for alleged collusion with foreign powers according to executive, Mark Simon on Twitterhttps://twitter.com/HKMarkSimon/status/1292600033473228800 - Via Twitter - Revieved on 10/08/2020 Tweet states: \\"Jimmy Lai is being arrested for collusion with foreign powers at this time.\\".

Overview Hong Kong is home to many of Asia's biggest media entities and remains one of the world's largest film industries. The loose regulation over the establishment of a newspaper makes Hong Kong home to many international media such as the Asian Wall Street Journal and Far Eastern Economic Review, and publications with anti-Communist backgrounds such as The Epoch Times (which is funded by Falun Gong). It also once had numerous newspapers funded by Kuomintang of Taiwan but all of them were terminated due to poor financial performance. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong publishes Kung Kao Po, a weekly newspaper. Apple Daily and Oriental Daily News are the two best selling newspapers, according to AC Nielsen, accounting for more than 60% of readership. Both are known for their anti-Hong Kong government political positions, colourful presentations and sensational news reportage. Whereas Apple Daily is strongly regarded as pro-democracy, Oriental Daily is inclined to be pro-China government. Traditional PRC government-friendly journals, Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po, are owned by the Central Government Liaison Office. In December 2015, the South China Morning Post ‚Äì Hong Kong's newspaper of record ‚Äì was acquired by the Alibaba Group, with the declared aim of promoting an alternative pro-China narrative to international media. The freedom of press is protected by the Bill of Rights, in contrast to the rest of China where control over media is pervasive. However, this freedom has been in decline since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. According to the Reporters Without Borders, Hong Kong enjoyed \\"real press freedom\\" and ranked second in Asia after Japan in the Press Freedom Index, although it has been rapidly declining. Different views over topics sensitive in mainland China, such as the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule, and democracy are still dynamically discussed among the media. Many books banned in China, such as the memoir of Zhao Ziyang, a former CCP party leader who stepped down in 1989, continue to be published in Hong Kong. In 2002, Hong Kong had: *Daily newspapers: 52 **Chinese-language dailies: 27 **English-language dailies: 3 **English-language newspapers publishing 5 or 6 days a week: 6 **Bilingual dailies: 5 **Newspapers in other languages: 7 *Free-to-air commercial TV companies: 3 *Subscription TV licensees: 4 *Non- domestic television programme licensees: 12 *Government radio-television station: 1 *Commercial radio stations: 2 Law =Media authorities= Formerly, three statutory bodies regulated media in Hong Kong, with another statutory body acting as an independent broadcaster: *Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority (BA) regulates broadcasters in Hong Kong by licensing and penalties according to the Broadcasting Regulation. *Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) is responsible for monitoring television and radio broadcasting to secure proper standards. *Telecommunications Authority, (OFCA) the regulatory agency which applied held legislative power over antitrust, spectrum allocation and telecommunications legislation. *Radio Television Hong Kong operates as an independent government broadcaster with 7 radio channels and 3 television channels, whilst also producing programmes for public dissemination. In 2012, BA, OFCA and TELA were merged into one to form the new Communications Authority, which combined all the functions of its three predecessor organisations in one. Non-Governmental bodies: *Press Council was established in July 2000. The objective of the Council is to promote the professional and ethical standards of the newspaper industry, defend press freedom, and deal with public complaints against local newspapers. It is an independent organisation.Presscouncil.org.hk \\"Presscouncil .\\" Hong Kong Press Council. Retrieved on 5 May 2007. =Media regulation= Freedom of the press and publication are enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong's mini-constitution, and are also protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) under Article 39 of the Basic Law. There is no law called \\"media law\\" in Hong Kong. Instead, the media are governed by statutory laws. In brief, there are 31 Ordinances that are directly related to mass media. Six of which are highlighted below. *Registration of Local Newspapers Ordinance (Cap. 268), provides for the registration of local newspapers and news agencies and the licensing of newspaper distributors. *Books Registration Ordinance (Cap. 142) (Cap. 106), provides for the registration and preservation of copies of books first printed, produced or published in Hong Kong. *Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap. 106), makes better provision for the licensing and control of telecommunications, telecommunications services and telecommunications apparatus and equipment. *Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap. 390) controls and classifies articles which consist of or contain material that is obscene or indecent. Obscene Articles Tribunals are established to determine whether an article is obscene or indecent. *Broadcasting Authority Ordinance (Cap. 391), provides for the establishment and functions of a Broadcasting Authority. *Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap. 562), licenses companies to provide broadcasting services and regulate the provision of broadcasting services by licensees. The rest of the Ordinances are of less importance since they do not aim at regulating mass media, but some of their provisions do affect the operation of media organisations and also the freedom of press. The passing of Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO) in 1986 strengthened the protection of fundamental human rights like press freedom or freedom of speech. This has been reflected in the loosening of control over mass media. Laws that violate the principle of press freedom are gradually amended. For example, section 27 of Public Order Ordinance, which criminalised the publishing of false news, was repealed in 1989. Nonetheless, there are still concerns among the media sector that some existing laws may still undermine the freedom of the press and publication, e.g. Official Secrets Ordinance (Cap. 521) and Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245). Media Schema of media control by the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in Hong Kong =Television= Hong Kong has two broadcast television stations, ATV and TVB. The latter, launched in 1967, was the territory's first free-to-air commercial station, and is currently the predominant TV station in the territory. Paid cable and satellite television have also been widespread. The production of Hong Kong's soap drama, comedy series and variety shows have reached mass audiences throughout the Chinese- speaking world. Many international and pan-Asian broadcasters are based in Hong Kong, including News Corporation's STAR TV. Hong Kong's terrestrial commercial TV networks, Christian Broadcasting Network of Hong Kong, TVB and ATV, can also be seen in neighbouring Guangdong and Macau (via cable). However, ATV has seen a gradual decline in production quality and audience rating in recent years and faces financial difficulties. Its false report of death of Jiang Zemin severely damaged its credibility. On 1 April 2015, Hong Kong's Executive Council gave notice that ATV's terrestrial television licence would not be renewed and that it would instead end on 1 April 2016. RTHK and newcomer HKTVE (owned by Richard Li's PCCW which also owns the IPTV service Now TV) took over the frequencies of ATV since 2 April 2016. In May 2017, Fantastic Television started its free-to-air broadcast. =Radio= *Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) ‚Äì government-funded, operates seven networks in Cantonese, Mandarin and English *Commercial Radio (CR) ‚Äì operates CR1, CR2 networks in Cantonese and mediumwave (AM) English-language station AM 864 *Metro Radio Hong Kong (MRHK) ‚Äì operates Metro Showbiz, Metro Finance and English-language Metro Plus = Book publishers = Sino United Publishing, formed in 1988 through merger of some of the historic publishing agencies, is Hong Kong's largest integrated publishing group. It has an estimated 80% share of the book publishing market.Lam, Jeffie (8 March 2015). \\"Hong Kong book giant in censorship row after returning title\\" . South China Morning Post. It is Hong Kong's largest Chinese-language publishing group, has 51 retail outlets in the territory, and is wholly owned by Central Government Liaison Office, which also owns newspaper titles Ta Kung Pao and Wen Wei Po. =Newspapers= According to independent surveys conducted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, South China Morning Post and Ming Pao are the most trusted newspapers in Hong Kong. The Chinese language newspapers Headline Daily, Oriental Daily News, Apple Daily and Sun Daily have the highest shares in the Hong Kong newspaper market, while the Hong Kong Economic Times is the best-selling financial newspaper. The Standard, a free tabloid with a mass market strategy, is the most widely circulated English newspaper by a significant margin. Its rival, South China Morning Post, Hong Kong's newspaper of record, has the most paid subscribers among English-language papers in Hong Kong. Since its purchase by Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok's Kerry Media The South China Morning Post has gradually become pro-China, pro-establishment publication. It was announced on 11 December 2015 that Alibaba Group would acquire the South China Morning Post from Robert Kuok, who has owned it since 1993. Alibaba said that the acquisition was made out of the desire to improve China's image in light of the western bias of the journal. The latest to join the newspaper scene is HK01, which launched in March 2016. As a Hong Kong- based advocacy media, HK01 are dedicated to disrupting discussion with interactive multimedia storytelling through the Web, print and physical space. Readers can take advantage of its in-depth reporting and all-round analysis in current affairs, local stories and lifestyle features that will help them evolve into critical thinkers. =Magazines= =Public space media= *RoadShow *Newsline Express = Online media = Media organisations * FactWire ‚Äì a non-profit news agency * Next Media * Sing Tao News Corporation Limited * SCMP Group * Sino United Publishing - Hong Kong's largest Chinese publishing group, which has 51 retail outlets in the territory.  Media freedom  Although media freedom in Hong Kong is theoretically guaranteed by a bill of rights, the perceived freedom of the Hong Kong media according to the World Press Freedom Index ranks 61st out of 180 countries in 2014, having slid from 18th place in 2002. Concerns have been brought about by a number of factors and high-profile incidents affecting the media. Pundits and journalists alike have been alarmed at the erosion of journalists' ability to report the news in an objective manner. Journalists have complained about sensitive news stories critical of the government that they have been under undisguised pressure to change or soften. There has also been pressure on organisations including major financial institutions to pull advertising from newspapers that take a pro-democracy or anti-government stance, and the brazen attack on a respected newspaper editor; All told, the incidence of censorship, political pressure to self-censor and intimidation is increasing, according to PEN American Center and the International Federation of Journalists. The Hong Kong Journalists Association noted that there were at least 28 attacks on journalists covering the Umbrella Revolution. The aggressive moves made by publishing houses controlled by Sino United Publishing against independent publishers particularly since the 2014 protests, the unexplained disappearance in 2015 of four individuals linked to an independent publisher of sensitive books, as well as the acquisition of Hong Kong's newspaper of record by Alibaba Group all increased fears of political encroachment on press freedom by parties closely linked to the communist regime.Lam, Jeffie (8 March 2015). \\"Beijing 'behind new wave of anti-occupy books'\\". Publishing - South China Morning Post. Controversies =Credibility= Ethical studies have been conducted by four journalism groups (Hong Kong Journalists Association, Hong Kong News Executives' Association, Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, Hong Kong Press Photographers' Association). They could not deny the fact that the mass media were suffering decreasing respect of Hong Kong citizens. Journalism was no longer seen as a respectable profession. The public had little trust in newspapers. The news industry attributed this phenomenon to the citizens' complaints about the decreasing ethics of journalists. Stories were exaggerated often violating privacy. A study was conducted by Hong Kong Journalists Association in early 2007 to find that 58.4% of journalists in Hong Kong considered that the degree of freedom of speech had decreased since the handover in 1997. Furthermore, nearly 60% of the interviewed journalists also thought that more self-censorship had been practised then than 1997.HJKja. \\" HKja.\\" Article. Retrieved on 26 April 2007. Thirty percent of media workers participating in the survey admitted to having self-censored, and some forty percent knew of colleagues who had practised self-censorship. The chairman of the HKJA pointed out that after this self-censorship of media is related to political and economic pressures traceable linked to the Communist Party of China (CPC). She suggested that many media owners are representatives of the National People's Congress, have investments or eye investment opportunities in the mainland and are reluctant to jeopardise the political relationship. =Yellow journalism= On 19 October 1998, a woman killed her two young children by pushing them out of a window from a high-rise building and then jumped to kill herself. The husband Chan Kin Hong was widely reported to have little remorse on their death, saying he has \\"high libido\\" but his wife lost sexual drive after giving a birth to the latest baby and he had to visit prostitutes regularly. He also met another woman and planned to have his new life. He caused a significant public outcry. Some days later, Apple Daily published a front-page photograph showing Chan with two prostitutes soon after his family's deaths. It was later revealed that the newspaper had paid Chan to pose for the photograph and the newspaper subsequently published a front-page apology. This incident and other concerns over increasingly aggressive news coverage and paparazzi in the intensive media battles for readers and viewers began widespread public discussions regarding press practices and accompanying ethical concerns that continue to this day over issues of privacy, responsible reporting and journalistic standards.Michael Wong, \\"Lai in front-page apology for Apple's juicy widower stories\\" , The Standard, 11 November 1998 =National security= In 2003, the government attempted to implement the Article 23 of the Basic Law which prohibits crimes against national security and sedition. The National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 states that it is a legal offence for media to be seditious and disclose national secrets, but the vague definition led to concerns that it may become a political tool for accusing dissidents' voices, as has happened in Mainland China. The bill caused a significant public outrage and a mass demonstration of 500,000 people, forcing the government to withdraw the bill and several cabinet members to step down. =Capitalising on victims= Some nude photos of actress Carina Lau were distributed in East Magazine, and then Three Weekly in the span of a week. The photos were claimed to be taken in the early 90s when that actress was kidnapped. Though people from all social strata have shouted themselves hoarse to call on citizens to boycott the publications, many bought and read them even while condemning them for corrupting public morality. Those issues sold very well. Media ethics were raised as a hot topic; people investing in or working for \\"vile\\" publications were much criticised. As the public pressure grew, East Magazine finally ended publication. =Invasion of privacy= In August 2006, Gillian Chung of the local pop duo Twins filed a writ against Easyfinder Magazine for publishing photos of her changing backstage at a concert in Malaysia. This raised another media ethics and aggressive paparazzi concern. And again, the magazine sold well, printing two runs of the magazine, selling out twice. The Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority received 2875 complaints regarding the revealing photos and the incident was referred to the Obscene Articles Tribunal for further action. On 1 November 2006, Easy Finder lost its appeal against an obscenity ruling on the published article and pictures.HONG KONG: Twin photograph ruling upheld The appeal panel upheld the judgement, declaring the article \\"obscene\\", and saying it was a \\"calculated act of selling sexuality which is corrupting and revolting\\". = Violent assault on editor = Kevin Lau, who had been chief editor of the journal until January 2014, was attacked in the morning of 26 February 2014 as he was about to take breakfast at a restaurant in Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong. He was seriously injured in a targeted knife attack. Journalists and press of the world saw the attack as an attack on press freedom. Thousands of people, led by leading journalists, attended a rally to denounce violence and intimidation of the media.Siu, Beatrice (3 March 2014). \\"Pressing the point\\" . The Standard. = Siege of Apple Daily and attacks aimed at media owner = During the Umbrella revolution in 2014, anti-occupation protesters besieged the headquarters of Next Media, publisher of Apple Daily. They accused the paper of biased reporting.Qi Luo (14 October 2014). \\"Apple gets taste of own medicine\\" . The Standard. Masked men among the protesters prevented the loading of copies of Apple Daily as well as The New York Times onto delivery vans. Apple Daily sought a court injunction and a High Court judge issued a temporary order to prevent any blocking of the entrance. On 12 November, media tycoon Jimmy Lai was the target of an offal attack at the occupied Admiralty site by three men, who were detained by volunteer marshalls for the protest site. The offices of Next Media and the home of Jimmy Lai, who controls the group, were fire-bombed in mid January 2015.AFP (27 January 2015). Hong Kong media 'manipulated': report . China Post. = 2015 Policy address controversy = In the opening and concluding parts of his 2015 policy address, CY Leung attacked University of Hong Kong Students' Union publication, Undergrad, for allegedly advocating independence and self-determination for Hong Kong. He also criticised another HKU publication, from 2013, entitled Hong Kong Nationalism.Cheng, Kevin; Wong, Hilary (16 January 2015). \\"CY trades barbs with democrats over free speech\\" .

'Fallacies' in HKU magazine blasted. The Standard. The number two and number three government officials, Carrie Lam and John Tsang respectively, distanced themselves from Leung, suggesting that Leung's controversial criticism of the magazines was personal and written by Leung himself; Leung insisted it was a team effort. = Sino United returns controversy = In January 2015, following CY Leung's attack on a compilation book entitled Hong Kong Nationalism, Joint Publishing, Chongwa, and Commercial Press - all owned by Sino United Publishing - de-listed the title. Hong Kong media reported that Sino had published and was distributing at least five anti-Occupy titles, and its stores were displaying these prominently, whereas popular books on the Umbrella movement by pro-democracy authors had been banished from their shelves. In March 2015, Up Publications, a small independent publishing house, complained that it was suddenly and unexpectedly faced with a large number of returns from the three main subsidiaries of Sino. Twenty titles were affected by the returns, to the serious detriment to the finances of Up Publications; many of the titles returned were not politically themed. The publisher was allegedly told by a bookshop source that its stance in the 2014 occupation and its publishing of books supportive of the Umbrella Movement were responsible. Although no reason was given for the returns, political motives were suspected as two of the delisted books about the occupation were strong sellers at independent bookshops. = Booksellers disappearances = The disappearances of five Hong Kong people related to an independent publisher and bookstore in October to December 2015 precipitated an international outcry. The unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, and the violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. There is widespread suspicion that they are under detention in mainland China. = 2020 Appledaily Arrests Controversy = Following the promulgation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, Appledaily owner Jimmy Lai Chi Ying was arrested for alleged as part of an investigation into an online group that canvassed foreign countries to sanction Hong Kong. On the same day activist Chow Ting Agnes was arrest over NSL offences. The arrests are perceived as acts of suppression on the freedom of press in Hong Kong by the Chinese and HKSAR government.

The route runs along a former alignment of New Jersey Route 29 before the construction of the John Fitch Parkway in the 1960s. The route begins at Route 29 in the capital city of Trenton, running along Sanhican Road, River Road and West Upper Ferry Road into Ewing Township. The route serves primarily as a frontage road for Route 29. The northernmost portion of Route 175 is parallel to the Delaware and Raritan Canal until coming to an end at a merge with Route 29 in Ewing Township. Route 175 originates as alignment of Route 29, which followed local roads after the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. It remained Route 29 through the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering and was moved onto the John Fitch Parkway upon its completion in the 1960s. By 1969, the original alignment was designated as Route 175 and both roads have remained the same since. Route description Route 175 heading northbound through Ewing Township Route 175 begins at an off-ramp from New Jersey Route 29 and Aberfeldy Drive in the capital city of Trenton. Inside the city limits of Trenton, the route carries one-way traffic northbound and is maintained by the City of Trenton. The route heads northward, progressing through the northern residential districts on Sanhican Drive. The highway continues, paralleling Route 29 for a distance. At an intersection with Afton Avenue, the continuation of Abernethy Drive, Route 175 changes names from Sanhican Drive to River Road. The road becomes two-way, enters Ewing Township, and is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). The highway continues, intersecting with Mercer County Route 643 (Lower Ferry Road) in Ewing. A short distance later, Routes 175 and 29 pass under the West Trenton Railroad Bridge, which carries CSX's Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA's West Trenton Line, and head along the Delaware River, passing to the south of several high-end mansions. Route 175 itself passes to the south of condominium complexes, intersecting with the access road shortly afterward. Route 175 heading southbound (near West Trenton) at the intersection with County Route 634 A short distance later, Route 175 juts to the northeast near a commercial business, interchanging with Route 29. After the short interchange, the highway continues along the side of Route 29, intersecting with Wilburtha Road (formerly an intersection with New Jersey Route 39) in Ewing. Routes 175 and 29 continue northward, crossing through the woodlands north of Trenton, until Route 175 makes a bend to the northeast, intersecting with West Upper Ferry Road. The highway turns onto West Upper Ferry Road, heading to the northeast, crossing through a wealthy district in Ewing surrounded by woodlands. The route begins to enter fields, crossing over the Delaware and Raritan Canal on character-less bridge. After the bridge, Route 175 turns to the north onto River Road, while West Upper Ferry Road continues as Mercer County Route 634. Route 175 heads northward along the Delaware and Raritan Canal as River Road, passing through woodlands and residential homes. A short distance later, it intersects with State Police Drive, a road serving the New Jersey State Police headquarters. Continuing along the canal, Route 175 progresses northward, intersecting with Trooper Drive before crossing under Interstate 295 at Interchange 76. Route 175 continues for a short distance, becoming a divided highway just after the overpass. A short distance later, the highway comes to end as the right-of-way continues onto Route 29. History Intersection of Route 29, Route 175 and Lower Ferry Road in Ewing, with signage noting Route 175 as \\"River Road.\\" The West Trenton Railroad Bridge is in the background. Route 175 is an original alignment of Route 29 through Trenton and Ewing designated in the 1927 renumbering of state highways in New Jersey.State of New Jersey, Laws of 1927, Chapter 319. The original plan for a freeway along Route 29 started in the 1930s, with no progress until the 1950s, when construction began on John Fitch Parkway named after John Fitch. Construction of this alignment used up much of the available waterfront in Trenton, and by 1969, after Route 29 was realigned onto the new freeway, Route 175 was designated on the former alignment. Route 175 was designated as a No Passing Zone by NJDOT on September 14, 1982. The two highways (Route 175 and Route 29) have remained intact since.

The djed ( ìäΩ, Coptic j≈çt \\"pillar\\", anglicized /d í…õd/) is one of the more ancient and commonly found symbols in ancient Egyptian religion. It is a pillar-like symbol in Egyptian hieroglyphs representing stability. It is associated with the creator god Ptah and Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead. It is commonly understood to represent his spine. Myth In the Osiris myth, Osiris was killed by Set by being tricked into a coffin made to fit Osiris exactly. Set then had the coffin with the now deceased Osiris flung into the Nile. The coffin was carried by the Nile to the ocean and on to the city of Byblos in Lebanon. It ran aground and a sacred tree took root and rapidly grew around the coffin, enclosing the coffin within its trunk. The king of the land, intrigued by the tree's quick growth, ordered the tree cut down and installed as a pillar in his palace, unaware that the tree contained Osiris's body. Meanwhile, Isis searched for Osiris aided by Anubis, and came to know of Osiris's location in Byblos. Isis maneuvered herself into the favor of the king and queen and was granted a boon. She asked for the pillar in the palace hall, and upon being granted it, extracted the coffin from the pillar. She then consecrated the pillar, anointing it with myrrh and wrapping it in linen. This pillar came to be known as the pillar of djed. Origin and development Image:Seal ring Ptah the one with durable favours N2080 mp3h8731.jpgthumb200pxSeal ring featuring the inscription pt·∏• ·∏èd ·∏•zwt \\"Ptah, the one with durable favors\\" Hieroglyphs (read from right, top): [the creator god] Ptah (pt·∏•) [gives] enduring (djed) favors (i.e. libation offerings, expressed with the biliteral ·∏•z depicted triply for plural). The djed may originally have been a fertility cult related pillar made from reeds or sheaves or a totem from which sheaves of grain were suspended or grain was piled around. Erich Neumann remarks that the djed pillar is a tree fetish, which is significant considering that Egypt was primarily treeless. He indicates that the myth may represent the importance of the importation of trees by Egypt from Syria. The djed came to be associated with Seker, the falcon god of the Memphite Necropolis, then with Ptah, the Memphite patron god of craftsmen. Ptah was often referred to as \\"the noble djed\\", and carried a scepter that was a combination of the djed symbol and the ankh, the symbol of life. Ptah gradually came to be assimilated into Osiris. By the time of the New Kingdom, the djed was firmly associated with Osiris. In their 2004 book The Quick and the Dead: Biomedical Theory in Ancient Egypt, Andrew Hunt Gordon and Calvin W. Schwabe speculated that the ankh, djed, and was symbols have a biological basis derived from ancient cattle culture (linked to the Egyptian belief that semen was created in the spine), thus: * the ankh, symbol of life, thoracic vertebra of a bull (seen in cross section) * the djed, symbol of stability, base on sacrum of a bull's spine * the was-sceptre, symbol of power and dominion, a staff featuring the head and tail of the god Set, \\"great of strength\\" Hieroglyphic usage The djed hieroglyph was a pillar-like symbol that represented stability. It was also sometimes used to represent Osiris himself, often combined \\"with a pair of eyes between the crossbars and holding the crook and flail.\\" The djed hieroglyph is often found together with the tyet (also known as Isis knot) hieroglyph, which is translated as life or welfare. The djed and the tiet used together may depict the duality of life. The tyet hieroglyph may have become associated with Isis because of its frequent pairing with the djed. Ceremonial usage A scene on the west wall of the Osiris Hall at Abydos shows the raising of the Djed pillar. Limestone pyramidion. Curved sides, no hieroglyphic inscriptions. Relief showing arms of djed holding sun disc. Two adoring baboons. From Gurob, Faiyum. Dynasty XIX. Petrie Museum of Egyptian Archaeology, London The djed was an important part of the ceremony called \\"raising the djed\\", which was a part of the celebrations of the Sed festival, the Egyptian jubilee celebration. The act of raising the djed has been explained as representing Osiris's triumph over Seth. Ceremonies in Memphis are described where the pharaoh, with the help of the priests, raised a wooden djed column using ropes. The ceremony took place during the period when fields were sown and the year's agricultural season would begin, corresponding to the month of Koiak, the fourth month of the Season of the Inundation. This ceremony was a part of one of the more popular holidays and celebrations of the time, a larger festival dedicated to Osiris conducted from the 13th to 30th day of the Koiak. Celebrated as it was at that time of the year when the soil and climate were most suitable for agriculture, the festival and its ceremonies can be seen as an appeal to Osiris, who was the God of vegetation, to favor the growth of the seeds sown, paralleling his own resurrection and renewal after his murder by Seth. Further celebrations surrounding the raising of the djed are described in a relief in Amenhotep III's Luxor Temple. In the tomb in the temple, the scene shows the raising of the djed pillar taking place in the morning of Amenhotep III's third Sed festival, which took place in his thirty-seventh regnal year. The scene is described by Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes: Djed constructed of gilded inlay on wood with red, blue, and green glass. Walters Art Museum. There is also a scene depicted in the tomb to the right of the above scene which has not been well preserved. Hodel-Hoenes explains that it once showed the pharaoh, accompanied by his queen, using a rope to raise the djed pillar. Three men, probably priests of the temple of Memphis, help him in the process. A fourth priest was seen supporting the pillar. Various offerings were presented before the pillar below the ropes. The pharaoh and his queen are each accompanied by four pairs of young women resembling those of the sed-festival. Each of these women is rattling a Hathor sistrum, a musical instrument for percussion with a U-shaped handle and frame seen as resembling the face and horns of the cow goddess Hathor, while holding a menat, a protective amulet associated with Hathor, in the other hand. A line of hieroglyphs running just above the girls' heads in each row of women says, \\"Children of the king praising (or charming) the noble djed pillar.\\" Hodel-Hoenes interprets this as identifying the girls as the daughters of Amenhotep III. There are three additional reliefs below these two reliefs. They depict further ceremonies that accompany the erection of the djed pillar, especially games and dances. In one, food-bearers carrying edibles weave between men dancing with heavy steps. A line of singers on the far left seems to sing a short hymn to Ptah, the text of which is written alongside the line. Singing and dancing girls can be seen in the next relief, though Hodel-Hoenes comments on their seeming lack of grace, saying, \\"only the raised hands and the foot swinging in the air hint at the movements of a dance.\\" The relief also depicts men involved in a boxing match and a stick dance, sports and dances which can still be seen in Egypt today. The festival of the raising of the djed also involved reenactments conducted at Denderah, Edfu, Busiris, Memphis, and Philae. But the most elaborate and grand celebration occurred at Abydos, the cult center of Osiris. From around the end of the third millennium BC during the beginning of the Dynasty XII and perhaps as early as the Dynasty VI three hundred years earlier, reenactments of the Osiris myth ‚Äì the deception and murder of Osiris by Seth, the search for Osiris by Isis and Osiris' mummification, funeral and his resurrection were performed. From the late fourth century BC, a recitation of the Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys, a poem describing Isis and Nephthys' search for Osiris, was added to the ceremony on the 25th day of Koiak. At the Osiris Temple in Abydos, these re-enactments are described as involving hundreds of priests and priestesses in the roles of the gods and goddesses, with 34 reed boats carrying the gods, a sculpture of Osiris inside an elaborate chest, 365 ornamental lamps, incense, and dozens of djed amulets. Usage as amulets A djed amulet with the name of Ramesses IX of the Twentieth Dynasty inscribed upon it. The djed pillar was often used as amulets for the living and the dead. It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was supposed to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The Egyptian Book of the Dead lists a spell which when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy's neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be able to sit up. It was also painted onto coffins. Parallels in other cultures Parallels have also been drawn between the djed pillar and various items in other cultures. Sidney Smith in 1922, first suggested a parallel with the Assyrian \\"sacred tree\\" when he drew attention to the presence of the upper four bands of the djed pillar and the bands that are present in the center of the vertical portion of the tree. He also proposed a common origin between Osiris and the Assyrian god Assur with whom he said, the sacred tree might be associated. Cohen and Kangas suggest that the tree is probably associated with the Sumerian god of male fertility, Enki and that for both Osiris and Enki, an erect pole or polelike symbol stands beneath a celestial symbol. They also point out that the Assyrian king is depicted in proximity to the sacred tree, which is similar to the depiction of the pharaoh in the raising of the djed ceremony. Additionally, the sacred tree and the Assyrian winged disk, which are generally depicted separately, are combined in certain designs, similar to the djed pillar which is sometimes surmounted with a solar disk. Katherine Harper and Robert Brown also discuss a possible strong link between the djed column and the concept of kundalini in yoga.

The bombing of the boat had been designed to make the ship unsalvageable. The first smaller bomb bent the propeller shaft, making repair uneconomic. Pereira stayed inside the boat to get his camera and other pieces of equipment. The second, more powerful explosion, designed to sink the boat, caused a huge inrush of seawater that drowned Pereira. The Rainbow Warrior led a flotilla of yachts protesting against French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia and was about to depart Auckland for a campaign of legal demonstrations in international waters near the French military operational areas at Moruroa Atoll. The night of the bombing The Greenpeace flagship Rainbow Warrior lay moored at Auckland's Marsden Wharf on Wednesday, 10 July 1985. It had arrived in New Zealand from Vanuatu three days earlier ‚Äì a week after President Haruo Remeliik had been assassinated in Palau. Greenpeace campaigners were preparing the former North Sea fishing trawler for the environmental group's biggest-ever protest voyage to Mururoa, one which they hoped would alert the world over France's nuclear testing and radioactive poisoning of the oceans. On board, supporters celebrated the 29th birthday of Steve Sawyer, the American co-ordinator of the Pacific Peace Voyage. Unknown to the Greenpeace activists, French secret agents Dominique Prieur and Alain Mafart, had set off in an inflatable dinghy across the 2 km stretch of the harbour from Mechanics Bay. When they arrived, they both swam underwater with the bombs, clamp and rope to the stern of the Rainbow Warrior. Tonel attached the smaller, 10 kg bomb to the propeller shaft. Camurier fixed the clamp on to the keel and ran out a rope to pinpoint a spot to attach the larger bomb next to the engine room. The hull explosive were meant to sink the ship and the propeller mine was meant to cripple it. Both bombs were timed to explode in just over three hours, at 11.50 pm. Once the explosives were set, the Frenchmen headed back to their hidden Zodiac. The first blast ripped a hole the size of a garage door in the engine room. The force of the explosion was powerful enough to push a freighter that was moored on the other side of Marsden Wharf 5m sideways. The Rainbow Warrior rapidly sank until the keel touched the harbor floor and the shocked crew scrambled on to the wharf. But Pereira dashed down a narrow stairway to one of the stern cabins to rescue his expensive cameras. The second explosion probably stunned him and he drowned with his camera straps tangled around his legs. Fernando's daughter Marelle, who was aged eight at the time of his death, appealed in 1995 through the French newspaper Lib√©ration to anybody who was involved in the bombing operation to tell her fully what had happened. \\"Now I am 18, I am an adult and I think by now I have the right to know exactly what events transpired surrounding the explosion which cost my father his life\\", she wrote. She also travelled to New Zealand to interview former Prime Minister David Lange and Greenpeace campaigners who sailed on the Rainbow Warrior. Subsequent updates On the twentieth anniversary of the sinking, it was revealed that the French president Fran√ßois Mitterrand had personally authorized the bombing. Report Says Mitterrand Approved Sinking of Greenpeace Ship, \\"The New York Times\\", 10 July 2005 Admiral Pierre Lacoste made a statement saying Pereira's death weighed heavily on his conscience. Also on that anniversary, Television New Zealand sought to access a video record made at the preliminary hearing where the two agents pleaded guilty.

Direcci√≥n de Inteligencia Nacional () or DINA was the secret police of Chile during the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. The DINA has been referred to as Pinochet's Gestapo.Article Manuel Contreras, el jefe de la Gestapo de Pinochet in Spanish online newspaper El Pais on 08 August 2015, retrieved on 08 August 2015 Established in November 1973 as a Chilean Army intelligence unit headed by Colonel Manuel Contreras and vice-director Ra√∫l Iturriaga, the DINA was then separated from the army and made an independent administrative unit in June 1974 under the auspices of Decree 521. The DINA existed until 1977, after which it was renamed the Central Nacional de Informaciones () or CNI. In 2008, the Chilean Army presented a list of 1,097 DINA agents to Judge Alejandro Sol√≠s.Article Piden desafuero de diputado Rosauro Mart√≠nez por asesinato de tres miembros del MIR en 1981 in Chilean online newspaper El Mostrador on 23 May 2013, retrieved on 23 May 2013  DINA internal suppression and human rights violations  Under decree #521, the DINA had the power to detain any individual so long as there was a declared state of emergency. Such an administrative state characterized nearly the entire length of the Pinochet government. Torture and rape of detainees was common:  DINA censorship of media  As of September 11, 1973, the military dictatorship worked with DINA to censor channels, newspapers, and radio transmissions that supported the Popular Socialist Union and supporters. A decree by the Junta established that all public information would have to be inspected and revised by the Junta before airing, and a couple days later an \\"Office of Censorship\\" was created to supervise all media. A lot of newspapers received their work back scribbled out with red ink. Through coercion, murder, and kidnappings, television outlets masked the truth on the coup d'√©tat as a plan by the military of Chile. Various international cable news networks were banned by DINA to prevent the news of the forced coup d'√©tat by the military. Some international networks were convinced to lie by the Junta about social and political aspects of Chile. The censorship breached particular homes and public services, and on September 23, 1973, DINA sent policemen to register households and institutions. They searched subversive evidence such as books by Pablo Neruda, articles on social sciences, political science, human rights, and those who were rounded up and burned at the Plaza de Armas (Santiago).  Foreign involvement  The United States backed and supported the Fatherland and Liberty which funded and attempted the first coup of Allende's regime known as Tanquetazo. The CIA established links after the 1973 Chilean coup d'√©tat however ties were cut after The Assassination of Orlando Letelier which former CIA agent Michael Townley was directly tied with which eventually led to the disbanding of The DINA in 1977.  DINA foreign assassinations and operations The DINA was involved in Operation Condor, as well as Operation Colombo. In July 1976, two magazines in Argentina and Brazil appeared and published the names of 119 Chilean leftist opponents, claiming they had been killed in internal disputes unrelated to the Pinochet regime. Both magazines disappeared after this one and only issue. Judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia eventually asked Chilean justices to lift Pinochet's immunity in this case, called \\"Operation Colombo\\", having accumulated evidence that Pinochet had ordered the DINA to plant this disinformation, in order to cover up the \\"disappearance\\" and murder by the Chilean secret police of those 119 persons. In September 2005, Chile's Supreme Court ordered the lifting of Pinochet's general immunity from prosecutions, with respect to this case. =Assassinations of Carlos Prats and Orlando Letelier= The DINA worked with international agents, such as Michael Townley, who assassinated former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington DC in 1976, as well as General Carlos Prats in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1974. Michael Townley worked with Eugenio Berr√≠os on producing sarin gas in the 1970s, at a laboratory in a DINA-owned house in the district of Lo Curro, Santiago de Chile. Eugenio Berr√≠os, who was murdered in 1995, was also linked with drug traffickers and agents of the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).El coronel que le pena al ej√©rcito , La Naci√≥n, September 24, 2005  Accounts of daily life in Chile  Some writers and journalists that opposed this right-wing regime secretly interviewed people living under DINA. Writers such as Patricia Politzer interviewed people who suffered. Politzer writes about specific incidents in Chile. One of the accounts is about a mother of a leftist sympathizer who was a victim of forced disappearances in Chile. The mother has never heard nor received any update on her son's status, even after Pinochet was removed from power. Many of those who disappeared or were murdered were never identified and thousands of leftist sympathizers remain missing. These unsolved disappearances and kidnappings have left thousands searching for their relatives in Chile to this day. There was minimal compensation and children suffered greatly as well. In another interview, Politzer gives an account of a woman who was shot with other leftists and managed to survive. She explains that, had she died at the hands of DINA, her children would have been left behind with no one to look after them. These accounts reveal the lack of consideration of DINA and other agencies that answered to Pinochet. Children would be left behind as orphans. All these accounts in \\"Fear in Chile\\", by Patricia Politzer, vividly showed what life was like in Chile under Pinochet.  Replacement of DINA by the CNI  DINA was replaced by the CNI (Central Nacional de Informaciones) in 1977 and Contreras was replaced by general Odlanier Mena. By that time, DINA had reached its military goals: assassinate the Movimiento de Izquierda Revolucionaria (MIR) leadership and the main leaders of the Popular Unity, the coalition of the parties that had won the 1970 elections. The dissolution of the CNI occurred in 1990 during the Chilean transition to democracy. After the fall of Pinochet's regime, Contreras was prosecuted in Chile due to crimes against humanity while heading the DINA and sentenced to 12 years in prison for covert kidnappings, a crime that had not been amnestied. However, judge V√≠ctor Montiglio who had replaced judge Juan Guzm√°n Tapia gave amnesty to Contreras in 2005. Finally, on June 30, 2008, Contreras was sentenced to two life-sentences, one for the murder of Carlos Prats and one for the murder of his wife, Sof√≠a Cuthbert. He also received an additional 20-year sentence for illicit association.  Other activities  In an undated letter to Augusto Pinochet, Michael Townley advised him that Virgilio Paz Romero, an anti-Castro Cuban, was taking photographs of British prisons in Northern Ireland in 1975 as a DINA assignment. The photographs were to be used by the Chilean government at the United Nations in New York to discredit the United Kingdom and accuse it of human rights violations. However they arrived too late to be used, and were finally published in El Mercurio.Activities of Virgilio Paz in Northern Ireland during 1975, National Security Archive Beginning in late 2014, in response to a request by then Senate Armed Services Committee Chair Carl Levin, the William J. Perry Center for Hemispheric Defense Studies, a U.S. Department of Defense institution for defense and security studies in the Western Hemisphere, has been under investigation by the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General. Insider national security whistleblower complaints allege that the Center knowingly protected a WJPC professor who belonged to the DINA during the dictatorship of Captain General Pinochet, as well as the clandestine participation of Center officials in the 2009 Honduran coup, gross mismanagement, corruption, homophobia, racism, and sexism. \\"Reports that NDU hired foreign military officers with histories of involvement in human rights abuses, including torture and extra-judicial killings of civilians, are stunning, and they are repulsive,\\" said Sen.

Russell-Wood, Brazil, The colonial era\\" in Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture, vol. 1, p. 410. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996. sugar production (16th‚Äì18th centuries); and finally on gold and diamond mining (18th century). Slaves, especially those brought from Africa, provided most of the work force of the Brazilian export economy after a brief period of Indian slavery to cut brazilwood. In contrast to the neighboring Spanish possessions, which had several viceroyalties with jurisdiction initially over New Spain (Mexico) and Peru, and in the eighteenth century expanded to viceroyalties of Rio de la Plata and New Granada, the Portuguese colony of Brazil was settled mainly in the coastal area by the Portuguese and a large black slave population working sugar plantations and mines. The boom and bust economic cycles were linked to export products. Brazil's sugar age, with the development of plantation slavery, merchants serving as middle men between production sites, Brazilian ports, and Europe was undermined by the growth of the sugar industry in the Caribbean on islands that European powers seized from Spain. Gold and diamonds were discovered and mined in southern Brazil through the end of the colonial era. Brazilian cities were largely port cities and the colonial administrative capital was moved several times in response to the rise and fall of export products' importance. Unlike Spanish America, which fragmented into many republics upon independence, Brazil remained a single administrative unit under a monarch, giving rise to the largest country in Latin America. Just as European Spanish and Roman Catholicism were a core source of cohesion among Spain's vast and multi-ethnic territories, Brazilian society was united by the Portuguese language and Roman Catholic faith. As the only Lusophone polity in the Americas, the Portuguese language was particularly important to Brazilian identity. Initial European contact and early colonial history (1494‚Äì1530) Portugal pioneered the European charting of sea routes that were the first and only channels of interaction between all of the world's continents, thus beginning the process of globalization. In addition to the imperial and economic undertaking of discovery and colonization of lands distant from Europe, these years were filled with pronounced advancements in cartography, shipbuilding and navigational instruments, of which the Portuguese explorers took advantage.Source: Europe and the Age of Exploration  Thematic Essay  Heilbrunn Timeline of Art History  The Metropolitan Museum of Art In 1494, the two kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula divided the New World between them (in the Treaty of Tordesillas), and in 1500 navigator Pedro √Ålvares Cabral landed in what is now Brazil and laid claim to it in the name of King Manuel I of Portugal. The Portuguese identified brazilwood as a valuable red dye and an exploitable product, and attempted to force indigenous groups in Brazil to cut the trees. =The Age of Exploration= Portuguese seafarers in the early fifteenth century, as an extension of the Portuguese Reconquista, began to expand from a small area of the Iberian Peninsula, to seizing the Muslim fortress of Ceuta in North Africa. Its maritime exploration then proceeded down the coast of West Africa and across the Indian Ocean to the south Asian subcontinent, as well as the Atlantic islands off the coast of Africa on the way. They sought sources of gold, ivory, and African slaves, high value goods in the African trade. The Portuguese set up fortified trading \\"factories\\" (feitorias), whereby permanent, fairly small commercial settlements anchored trade in a region. The initial costs of setting up these commercial posts was borne by private investors, who in turn received hereditary titles and commercial advantages. From the Portuguese Crown's point of view, its realm was expanded with relatively little cost to itself.James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America: A History of Colonial Spanish America and Brazil. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp. 24-26. On the Atlantic islands of the Azores, Madeira, and SƒÅo Tom√©, the Portuguese began plantation production of sugarcane using forced labor, a precedent for Brazil's sugar production in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.Lockhart and Schwartz, Early Latin America, pp. 26-27. The Portuguese \\"discovery\\" of Brazil was preceded by a series of treaties between the kings of Portugal and Castile, following Portuguese sailings down the coast of Africa to India and the voyages to the Caribbean of the Genoese mariner sailing for Castile, Christopher Columbus. The most decisive of these treaties was the Treaty of Tordesillas, signed in 1494, which created the Tordesillas Meridian, dividing the world between the two kingdoms. All land discovered or to be discovered east of that meridian was to be the property of Portugal, and everything to the west of it went to Spain. The Tordesillas Meridian divided South America into two parts, leaving a large chunk of land to be exploited by the Spaniards. The Treaty of Tordesillas was arguably the most decisive event in all Brazilian history, since it determined that part of South America would be settled by Portugal instead of Spain. The present extent of Brazil's coastline is almost exactly that defined by the Treaty of Madrid, which was approved in 1750. Portuguese map by Lopo Homem (c. 1519) showing the coast of Brazil and natives extracting brazilwood, as well as Portuguese ships =Arrival and early exploitation= On April 22, 1500, during the reign of King Manuel I, a fleet led by navigator Pedro √Ålvares Cabral landed in Brazil and took possession of the land in the name of the king. Although it is debated whether previous Portuguese explorers had already been in Brazil, this date is widely and politically accepted as the day of the discovery of Brazil by Europeans. The place where √Ålvares Cabral arrived is now known as Porto Seguro (\\"safe harbor\\"), in Northeastern Brazil. Cabral was leading a large fleet of 13 ships and more than 1000 men following Vasco da Gama's way to India, around Africa. Cabral was able to safely enter and leave Brazil in ten days, despite having no means of communication with the indigenous people there, due to the experience Portuguese explorers, such as de Gama, had been amassing over the past few decades in interacting with foreign peoples. The Portuguese colonization, around 80 years earlier, of islands off of West Africa such as S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe, were the first examples of the Portuguese monarchy beginning to move from a crusading and looting-centric attitude, to a trade- centric attitude when approaching new lands. The latter attitude required communication and cooperation with indigenous people, thus, interpreters. This informed Cabral's actions in Brazil. As Cabral realized that no one in his convoy spoke the language of the indigenous people in Brazil, he took every effort to avoid violence and conflict and used music and humor as forms of communication. Just a few months before Cabral landed, Vicente Y√°√±ez Pinz√≥n came to the northeastern coast of Brazil and deployed many armed men ashore with no means of communicating with the indigenous people. One of his ships and captains was captured by indigenous people and eight of his men were killed. Cabral no doubt learned from this to treat communication with the utmost priority. Cabral left two degredados (criminal exiles) in Brazil to learn the native languages and to serve as interpreters in the future. The practice of leaving degredados in new lands to serve as interpreters in the future came straight from the colonization of the islands off of the West African coast 80 years before Cabral landed in Brazil. The brazilwood tree, which gives Brazil its name, has dark, valuable wood and provides red dye. After the voyage of √Ålvares Cabral, the Portuguese concentrated their efforts on the lucrative possessions in Africa and India and showed little interest in Brazil. Between 1500 and 1530, relatively few Portuguese expeditions came to the new land to chart the coast and to obtain brazilwood. In Europe, this wood was used to produce a valuable dye to give color to luxury textiles. To extract brazilwood from the tropical rainforest, the Portuguese and other Europeans relied on the work of the natives, who initially worked in exchange for European goods like mirrors, scissors, knives and axes.Alexander Marchant, From Barter to Slavery: The Economic Relations of Portuguese and Indians in the Settlement of Brazil, 1500-1580. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Press 1942. In this early stage of the colonization of Brazil, and also later, the Portuguese frequently relied on the help of Europeans who lived together with the indigenous people and knew their languages and culture. The most famous of these were the Portuguese Jo√£o Ramalho, who lived among the Guaianaz tribe near today's S√£o Paulo, and Diogo √Ålvares Correia, who acquired the name Caramuru, who lived among the Tupinamb√° natives near today's Salvador da Bahia. Over time, the Portuguese realized that some European countries, especially France, were also sending excursions to the land to extract brazilwood. Worried about foreign incursions and hoping to find mineral riches, the Portuguese crown decided to send large missions to take possession of the land and combat the French. In 1530, an expedition led by Martim Afonso de Sousa arrived in Brazil to patrol the entire coast, ban the French, and create the first colonial villages like S√£o Vicente on the coast. Structure of colonization Because Brazil was not home to complex civilizations like the Aztec and the Inca in Mexico and Peru, the Portuguese could not place themselves on an established social structure. This, coupled with the fact that tangible material wealth was not found until the 18th century, made the relationship between the Portuguese and the Brazilian colony very different from the relationship of the Spanish to their land in the Americas. For example, the Brazilian colony was at first thought of as a commercial asset that would facilitate trade between the Portuguese and India and not a place to be settled to develop a society. The social model of conquest in Brazil was one geared toward commerce and entrepreneurial ideals rather than conquest as was the case in the Spanish realm. As time progressed, the Portuguese crown found that having the colony serve as a trading post was not ideal for regulating land claims in the Americas, so they decided that the best way to keep control of their land was to settle it. Thus, the land was divided into fifteen private, hereditary captaincies, the most successful of which being Pernambuco and S√£o Vicente. Pernambuco succeeded by growing sugarcane. S√£o Vicente prospered by dealing in indigenous slaves. The other thirteen captaincies failed, leading the king to make colonization a royal effort rather than a private one. In 1549, Tom√© de Sousa sailed to Brazil to establish a central government. De Sousa brought along Jesuits, who set up missions, saved many natives from slavery, studied native languages, and converted many natives to Roman Catholicism. The Jesuits' work to pacify a hostile tribe helped the Portuguese expel the French from a colony they had established at present-day Rio de Janeiro. Portuguese map (1574) by Lu√≠s Teixeira, showing the location of the hereditary captaincies of Brazil =Captaincies= The first attempt to colonize Brazil followed the system of hereditary captaincies (Capitanias Heredit√°rias), which had previously been used successfully in the colonization of Madeira Island. These captaincies were granted by royal decree to private hands, namely to merchants, soldiers, sailors, and petty nobility, saving the Portuguese crown from the high costs of colonization. The Captaincies granted control over areas of land and all that resided upon it. Furthermore, the splitting of land highlights the economic importance a large amount of land would have for red-dye producing trees and sugar plantations. Thus, between 1534 and 1536 King John III divided the land into 15 captaincy colonies, which were given to those who wanted and had the means to administer and explore them. The captains were granted ample powers to administer and profit from their possessions. From the 15 original captaincies, only two, Pernambuco and S√£o Vicente, prospered. The failure of most captaincies was related to the resistance of the indigenous people, shipwrecks and internal disputes between the colonizers.. Failure can also be attributed to the Crown not having a strong administrative hold due to Brazil's reliance on its exportation economy. Pernambuco, the most successful captaincy, belonged to Duarte Coelho, who founded the city of Olinda in 1536. His captaincy prospered with sugarcane mills installed after 1542 producing sugar. Sugar was a very valuable good in Europe, and its production became the main Brazilian colonial produce for the next 150 years. The captaincy of S√£o Vicente, owned by Martim Afonso de Sousa, also produced sugar but its main economic activity was the traffic of indigenous slaves. =Governors General= With the failure of most captaincies and the menacing presence of French ships along the Brazilian coast, the government of King John III decided to turn the colonization of Brazil back into a royal enterprise. In 1549, a large fleet led by Tom√© de Sousa set sail to Brazil to establish a central government in the colony. Tom√© de Sousa, the first Governor-General of Brazil, brought detailed instructions, prepared by the King's aides, about how to administer and foster the development of the colony. His first act was the foundation of the capital city, Salvador da Bahia, in Northeastern Brazil, in today's state of Bahia. The city was built on a slope by a bay (Todos-os- Santos Bay) and was divided into an upper administrative area and a lower commercial area with a harbour. Tom√© de Sousa also visited the captaincies to repair the villages and reorganise their economies. In 1551, the Diocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia was established in the colony, with its seat in Salvador. Salvador today ‚Äì the architecture of the city's historic centre is typically Portuguese. The second Governor General, Duarte da Costa (1553‚Äì1557), faced conflicts with the indigenous people and severe disputes with other colonizers and the bishop. Wars against the natives around Salvador consumed much of his government. The fact that the first bishop of Brazil, Pero Fernandes Sardinha, was killed and eaten by the Caet√© natives after a shipwreck in 1556 illustrates how strained the situation was between the Portuguese and many indigenous tribes. The third Governor-General of Brazil was Mem de S√° (1557‚Äì1573). He was an efficient administrator who managed to defeat the indigenous people and, with the help of the Jesuits, expel the French (Huguenots and some previous Catholic settlers) from their colony of France Antarctique. As part of this process his nephew, Est√°cio de S√°, founded the city of Rio de Janeiro there in 1565. The huge size of Brazil led to the colony being divided in two after 1621 when King Philip II created the states of Brasil, with Salvador as capital, and Maranh√£o, with its capital in S√£o Lu√≠s. The state of Maranh√£o was still further divided in 1737 into the Maranh√£o e Piau√≠ and Gr√£o-Par√° e Rio Negro, with its capital in Bel√©m do Par√°. Each state had its own Governor. After 1640, the governors of Brazil coming from the high nobility started to use the title of Vice-rei (Viceroy). In 1763 the capital of the Estado do Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. In 1775 all Brazilian Estados (Brasil, Maranh√£o and Gr√£o-Par√°) were unified into the Viceroyalty of Brazil, with Rio de Janeiro as capital, and the title of the king's representative was officially changed to that of Viceroy of Brazil. As in Portugal, each colonial village and city had a city council (c√¢mara municipal), whose members were prominent figures of colonial society (land owners, merchants, slave traders). Colonial city councils were responsible for regulating commerce, public infrastructure, professional artisans, prisons etc. 17th century-Jesuit church in S√£o Pedro da Aldeia, near Rio de Janeiro =Jesuit missions= Tom√© de Sousa, first Governor General of Brazil, brought the first group of Jesuits to the colony.For a comprehensive history of the Jesuits in Brazil see Serafim Leite, S.J. Hist√≥ria de Companhia de Jesus no Brasil. 10 vols. Lisbon 1938-50. More than any other religious order, the Jesuits represented the spiritual side of the enterprise and were destined to play a central role in the colonial history of Brazil. The spreading of the Catholic faith was an important justification for the Portuguese conquests, and the Jesuits were officially supported by the King, who instructed Tom√© de Sousa to give them all the support needed to Christianise the indigenous people. The first Jesuits, guided by Father Manuel da N√≥brega and including prominent figures like Juan de Azpilcueta Navarro, Leonardo Nunes and later Jos√© de Anchieta, established the first Jesuit missions in Salvador and in S√£o Paulo dos Campos de Piratininga, the settlement that gave rise to the city of S√£o Paulo. N√≥brega and Anchieta were instrumental in the defeat of the French colonists of France Antarctique by managing to pacify the Tamoio natives, who had previously fought the Portuguese. The Jesuits took part in the foundation of the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1565. The success of the Jesuits in converting the indigenous people to Catholicism is linked to their capacity to understand the native culture, especially the language. The first grammar of the Tupi language was compiled by Jos√© de Anchieta and printed in Coimbra in 1595. The Jesuits often gathered the aborigines into communities of resettlement called aldeias, similar in intent to the reductions implemented by Francisco de Toledo in southern Peru during the 1560s. where the natives worked for the community and were evangelized. Founded in the aftermath of the campaign undertaken by Mem de S√° from 1557 to force the submission of Salvadoran natives, the aldeias marked the transition of Jesuit policy from conversion by persuasion alone to the acceptance of force as a means of organizing natives with a means to then evangelizing them.Alida Metcalf, \\"Go-betweens and the colonization of Brazil, 1500-1600\\". Austin: University of Texas Press (2005), 110-112 Nevertheless, these aldeias were unattractive to the natives due to the introduction of epidemic diseases to the communities, the forced settlement of aldeia natives elsewhere to labor, and raiding of the aldeias by colonists eager to steal laborers for themselves thus causing natives to flee the settlements.Mark Burkholder, Lyman Johnson. \\"Colonial Latin America\\". New York: Oxford University Press (2001), 124 The aldeia model would again be used, though also unsuccessfully, by the Governor of the capitania de S√£o Paulo Lu√≠s Ant√≥nio de Sousa Botelho Mour√£o in 1765 in order to encourage mestizos, natives, and mulattoes to abandon slash-and-burn agriculture and adopt a sedentary farming lifestyle.Warren Dean \\"With Broadax and Firebrand: The Destruction of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest\\". Berkeley: University of California Press (1997), 100 The Jesuits had frequent disputes with other colonists who wanted to enslave the natives, but also with the hierarchy of the Catholic Church itself. Following the creation of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of S√£o Salvador da Bahia by the Pope, Bishop Pero Fernandes Sardinha arrived in Bahia in 1552 and took issue with the Jesuit mission led by Manoel da N√≥brega. Sardinha opposed the Jesuits taking part in indigenous dances and playing indigenous instruments since he viewed these activities has had little effect on conversion. The use of interpreters at confession by the Jesuits was also railed against by Sardinha who opposed the appropriation of indigenous culture for evangelization.Alida Metcalf, \\"Go-betweens and the colonization of Brazil, 1500-1600\\". Austin: University of Texas Press (2005), 102-104 Sardinha also challenged the Jesuit prohibition on waging war against and enslaving the indigenous population, eventually forcing N√≥brega to leave Bahia for the Jesuit mission at S√£o Vicente in late 1552 to return only at the conclusion of the Sardinha's tenure.Kenneth Mills, William B. Taylor, and Sandra Lauderdale Graham, \\"Colonial Latin America: A Documentary History\\". Lanham, Md.: SR Books, (2004), 95. The action of the Jesuits saved many natives from slavery, but also disturbed their ancestral way of life and inadvertently helped spread infectious diseases against which the aborigines had no natural defenses. Slave labour and trade were essential for the economy of Brazil and other American colonies, and the Jesuits usually did not object to the enslavement of African people. =French incursions= The potential riches of tropical Brazil led the French, who did not recognize the Tordesillas Treaty that divided the world between the Spanish and the Portuguese, to attempt to colonize parts of Brazil. In 1555, the Nicolas Durand de Villegaignon founded a settlement within Guanabara Bay, in an island in front of today's Rio de Janeiro. The colony, named France Antarctique, led to conflict with Governor General Mem de S√°, who waged war against the colony in 1560. Est√°cio de S√°, nephew of the Governor, founded Rio de Janeiro in 1565 and managed to expel the last French settlers in 1567. Jesuit priests Manuel da N√≥brega and Jos√© de Anchieta were instrumental in the Portuguese victory by pacifying the natives who supported the French.Charles E. Nowell, \\"The French in Sixteenth-Century Brazil,\\" The Americas 5 (1949):381-93. Another French colony, France √âquinoxiale, was founded in 1612 in present-day S√£o Lu√≠s, in the North of Brazil. In 1614 the French were again expelled from S√£o Lu√≠s by the Portuguese. View of a sugar-producing farm (engenho) in colonial Pernambuco by Dutch painter Frans Post (17th century) The sugar age (1530‚Äì1700) Since the initial attempts to find gold and silver failed, the Portuguese colonists adopted an economy based on the production of agricultural goods that were to be exported to Europe. Tobacco and cotton and some other agricultural goods were produced, but sugar became by far the most important Brazilian colonial product until the early 18th century. The first sugarcane farms were established in the mid-16th century and were the key for the success of the captaincies of S√£o Vicente and Pernambuco, leading sugarcane plantations to quickly spread to other coastal areas in colonial Brazil. Initially, the Portuguese attempted to utilize Indian slaves for sugar cultivation, but shifted to the use of black African slave labor.Stuart B. Schwartz, \\"Indian Labor and New World Demands and Indian Response in Northeastern Brazil.\\" American Historical Review 83 (1978) 43-79. While the availability of Amerindians did decrease due to epidemics afflicting the coastal native population and the declaration of King Sebasti√£o I's 1570 law which proclaimed the liberty of Brazilian natives, the enslavement of indigenous people increased after 1570. A new slave trade emerged where indigenous people were brought from the sert√µes or ‚Äúinland wilderness frontiers‚Äù by mixed-race mameluco under the loophole in the 1570 law that they were captured in just wars against native groups who \\"customarily\\" attacked the Portuguese. By 1580, as many as 40 000 natives could have been taken from the interior to toil as slaves on Brazil's interior, and this enslavement of indigenous people continued right throughout the colonial period.Alida Metcalf, \\"Go-betweens and the colonization of Brazil, 1500-1600\\". Austin: University of Texas Press (2005), 181-190 Golden Baroque inner decoration of the Franciscan church of Salvador (first half of the 18th century) The period of sugar-based economy (1530 ‚Äì c. 1700) is known as the sugar age in Brazil.James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America, chapter 7. Brazil in the Sugar Age. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983. The development of the sugar complex occurred over time, with a variety of models.Stuart B. Schwartz, \\"Free Farmers in a Slave Economy: The Lavradores de Cana in Colonial Bahia,\\" in Dauril Alden, ed. Colonial Roots of Modern Brazil. Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press 1973, pp. 147-97. The dependencies of the farm included a casa-grande (big house) where the owner of the farm lived with his family, and the senzala, where the slaves were kept. A notable early study of this complex is by Brazilian sociologist Gilberto Freyre.Gilberto Freyre, The Masters and the Slaves: A Study in the Development of Brazilian Civilization. New York: English edition 1956; 1933 Portuguese original edition. This arrangement was depicted in engravings and paintings by Frans Post as a feature of an apparently harmonious society.See the articles by Ernst van den Boogaart and by Elmer Kolfin in The Slave in European Art: From Renaissance Trophy to Abolitionist Emblem, ed Elizabeth McGrath and Jean Michel Massing, London (The Warburg Institute) and Turin 2012. Initially, the Portuguese relied on Amerindian slaves to work on sugarcane harvesting and processing, but they soon began importing black African slaves though the enslavement of indigenous people continued. Portugal owned several commercial facilities in Western Africa, where slaves were bought from African merchants. These slaves were then sent by ship to Brazil, chained and in crowded conditions. Enslaved Africans were more desirable and practical because many came from sedentary, agriculture-based societies and did not require as much training in how to farm as did members of Amerindian societies, which tended to not be primarily agricultural. Africans were also less vulnerable to disease than were Amerindians. The fact that Africans had been removed from their homelands made it more difficult for them to flee. The idea of using enslaved Africans in colonial farms based on monoculture was also adopted by other European colonial powers when colonizing tropical regions of America (Spain in Cuba, France in Haiti, the Netherlands in the Dutch Antilles and England in Jamaica). Slave labor demands varied based on region and on the type of harvest crop. In the Bahia region, where sugar was the principle crop, conditions for enslaved peoples were extremely harsh. It was often cheaper for slaveowners to literally work enslaved peoples to death over the course of a few years and replace them with newly imported enslaved people. Areas where manioc, a subsistence crop, was cultivated also utilized high numbers of enslaved peoples. In these areas, 40 to 60 percent of the population was enslaved. These regions were characterized by fewer work demands and better living and working conditions for enslaved peoples as compared to labor conditions for enslaved populations in sugar regions. The Portuguese attempted to severely restrict colonial trade, meaning that Brazil was only allowed to export and import goods from Portugal and other Portuguese colonies. Brazil exported sugar, tobacco, cotton and native products and imported from Portugal wine, olive oil, textiles and luxury goods ‚Äì the latter imported by Portugal from other European countries. Africa played an essential role as the supplier of slaves, and Brazilian slave traders in Africa frequently exchanged cacha√ßa, a distilled spirit derived from sugarcane, and shells, for slaves. This comprised what is now known as the Triangular trade between Europe, Africa and the Americas during the colonial period. Merchants during the sugar age were crucial to the economic development of the colony, the link between the sugar production areas, coastal Portuguese cities, and Europe.Rae Flory and David Grant Smith, \\"Bahian Merchants and Planters in the Seventeenth and Early Eighteenth Centuries.\\" Hispanic American Historical Review 58(1978):571-94. Merchants in the early came from many nations, including Germans, Flemings, and Italians, but Portuguese merchants came to dominate the trade in Brazil. During the union of the Spanish and Portuguese crowns (1580-1640), to be active in Spanish America as well, especially trading African slaves.Lockhart and Schwartz, Early Latin America, p. 221. Even though Brazilian sugar was reputed as being of high quality, the industry faced a crisis during the 17th and 18th centuries when the Dutch and the French started producing sugar in the Antilles, located much closer to Europe, causing sugar prices to fall. =Cities and towns= View of Olinda, ca. 1660, Frans Post Brazil had coastal cities and towns, which have been considered far less important than colonial settlements in Spanish America, but like Spanish America, urban settlements were important as the sites of institutional life of church and state, as well as urban groups of merchants. Unlike many areas of Spanish America, there was no dense, sedentary indigenous population which had already created settlements, but cities and towns in Brazil were similar to those in Spanish Colonial Venezuela. Port cities allowed Portuguese trade goods to enter, including African slaves, and export goods of sugar and later gold and coffee to be exported to Portugal and beyond. Coastal cities of Olinda (founded 1537), Salvador da Bahia (1549), Santos (1545), Vit√≥ria (1551), and Rio de Janeiro (1565) were also vital in the defense against pirates. Only S√£o Paulo in Minas Gerais was an important inland city. Unlike the network of towns and cities that developed in most areas of Spanish America, the coastal cities and their hinterlands were oriented toward Portugal directly with little connection otherwise. With sugar as the major export commodity in the early period and the necessity to process cane into exportable refined sugar on- site, the sugar engenhos had resident artisans and barber-surgeons, and functioned in some ways as small towns. Also unlike most Spanish settlements, Brazilian cities and towns did not have a uniform lay-out of central plaza and a check board pattern of streets, often because the topography defeated such an orderly layout.James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, pp.227-231. =New Christians= Converted Jews, so-called New Christians, many of whom were merchants, played a role in colonial Brazil. Their \\"importance in the colonial may be one explanation why the Inquisition was not permanently established in Brazil during the Iberian Union.\\" New Christians were well integrated into institutional life, serving in civil as well as ecclesiastical offices. The relative lack of persecution and abundance of opportunity allowed them to have a significant place in society. With the Iberian Union (1580-1640), many migrated to Spanish America.James Lockhart and Stuart B. Schwartz, Early Latin America. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 226-7. =The Iberian Union (1580‚Äì1640)= Philip II and I of Spain and Portugal, inserting the coat of arms of Portugal over those of Castile and Le√≥n and Aragon In 1580, a succession crisis led to the union of Portugal and Spain being ruled by the Habsburg King Philip II. The unification of the crowns of the two Iberian kingdoms, known as the Iberian Union, lasted until 1640 when the Portuguese revolted. During the union the institutions of both kingdoms remained separate. For Portuguese merchants, many of whom were Christian converts from Judaism (\\"New Christians\\") or their descendants, the union of crowns presented commercial opportunities in the slave trade to Spanish America.Lockhart and Schwartz, Early Latin America, p. 225, p. 250.Arnold Wiznitzer, the Jews of Colonial Brazil. New York: 1960. The Netherlands (the Seventeen Provinces) obtained independence from Spain in 1581, leading Philip II to prohibit commerce with Dutch ships, including in Brazil. Since the Dutch had invested large sums in financing sugar production in the Brazilian Northeast and were important as shippers of sugar,Lockhart and Schwartz, Early Latin America, p. 250. a conflict began with Dutch privateers plundering the coast: they sacked Salvador in 1604, from which they removed large amounts of gold and silver before a joint Spanish-Portuguese fleet recaptured the town. =Dutch rule in northeastern Brazil, 1630‚Äì1654= From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more permanently in commercial Recife and aristocratic Olinda.C.R. Boxer, The Dutch in Brazil: 1624-1654. New York: Oxford University Press 1957. With the capture of Paraiba in 1635, the Dutch controlled a long stretch of the coast most accessible to Europe (Dutch Brazil), without, however, penetrating the interior. The large Dutch ships were unable to moor in the coastal inlets where lighter Portuguese shipping came and went. Ironically, the result of the Dutch capture of the sugar coast was a higher price of sugar in Amsterdam. During the Nieuw Holland episode, the colonists of the Dutch West India Company in Brazil were in a constant state of siege, in spite of the presence of the Count John Maurice of Nassau as governor (1637‚Äì1644) in Recife. Nassau invited scientific commissions to research the local flora and fauna, resulting in added knowledge of the territory. Moreover, he set up a city project for Recife and Olinda, which was partially accomplished. Remnants survive into the modern era. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch finally withdrew in 1654; the Portuguese paid off a war debt in payments of salt. Few Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remain. but Albert Eckhout's paintings of indigenous and black Brazilians, as well as his still lifes are important works of baroque art. =Slavery in Brazil= Unlike neighboring Spanish America, Brazil was a slave society from its outset. The African slave trade was inherent to the economic and social structure of the colony. Years before the North American slave trade got underway, more slaves had been brought to Brazil than would ever reach British North America. It can be estimated that around 35% of all Africans captured in the Atlantic slave trade were sent to Brazil. The slave trade in Brazil would continue for nearly two hundred years and last the longest of any country in the Americas. African slaves had a higher monetary value than indigenous slaves largely because many of them came from agricultural societies and thus were already familiar with the work needed to maintain the profitable sugar plantations of Brazil. Also, African slaves were already immune to several of the Old World diseases that killed many indigenous people and were less likely to flee, as compared to indigenous slaves, since their place of origin was so inaccessible. However, many African slaves did in fact flee and created their own communities of runaway slaves called quilombos, which often became established political and economic entities. =Runaway slave settlements= Albert Eckhout, African warrior at the time of Ganga Zumba and leader of the Palmares quilombo Work on the sugarcane plantations in Northeast Brazil and other areas relied heavily on slave labor, mostly of central African origin. These enslaved people worked to resist slavery in many ways. Some of the most common forms of resistance involved engaging in sluggishness and sabotage. Other ways these enslaved peoples resisted was by exacting violence upon themselves and their babies, often to the point of death, and by seeking revenge against their masters. Another type of resistance to slavery was flight and, with the dense vegetation of the tropics, runaway slaves fled in numbers and for slave owners, this was an \\"endemic problem.\\"James Lockhart and Stuart Schwartz, Early Latin America. New York: Cambridge University Press 1983, p. 220. The realities of being on a frontier that was policed in less than optimal ways fostered the successful escapes of enslaved people. Since the early 17th century there are indications of runaway slaves organizing themselves into settlements in the Brazilian hinterland. These settlements, called mocambos and quilombos, were usually small and relatively close to sugar fields, and attracted not only African slaves but also people of indigenous origin. Quilombos were often viewed by Portuguese colonists as ‚Äúparasitic,‚Äù relying upon theft of livestock and crops, ‚Äúextortion, and sporadic raiding‚Äù for sustenance.Schwartz, Stuart B.

While the reasons for fugitive settlement are varied, quilombos were rarely wholly self- sufficient and although inhabitants may have engaged in agricultural pursuits, they depended on a kind of parasitic economy where proximity to settled areas were usually prerequisites for their long-term success. Unlike the palenque in Spanish America or fugitive slave settlements in the British Caribbean, Brazilian officials rebuked any kind of agreements to standardize the quilombos out of the fear of drawing even more fugitive slaves to their communities.Stuart Schwartz. \\"Slaves, Peasants, and Rebels: Reconsidering Brazilian Slavery\\". Urbana: University of Illinois Press (1992), 108‚Äì112. The largest of the quilombos was the Quilombo dos Palmares, located in today's Alagoas state, which grew to many thousands during the disruption of Portuguese rule with the Dutch incursion.Lockhart and Schwartz, Early Latin America, pp. 220-21. Palmares was governed by leaders Ganga Zumba and his successor, Zumbi. The terminology for the settlements and leaders come directly from Angola, with quilombo an Angolan word for military villages of diverse settlers and the nganga a nzumbi \\"was the priest responsible for the spiritual defense of the community.\\" The Dutch and later the Portuguese attempted several times to conquer Palmares, until an army led by famed S√£o Paulo-born Domingos Jorge Velho managed to destroy the great quilombo and kill Zumbi in 1695. Brazilian feature film director Carlos Diegues made a film about Palmares called simply Quilombo. Of the many quilombos that once existed in Brazil, some have survived to this day as isolated rural communities. Portuguese colonists sought to destroy these fugitive communities because they threatened the economic and social order of the slave regime in Brazil.Schwartz, Stuart B. (1992). \\"Rethinking Palmares: Slave Resistance in Colonial Brazil\\". Slaves, peasants, and rebels : reconsidering Brazilian slavery. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 4. . OCLC 857899745.

There was a constant fear among colonists that enslaved peoples would revolt and resist slavery. Two settler objectives were to discourage enslaved peoples from trying to escape and to close down their options for escape. Strategies used by Portuguese colonists to prevent enslaved people from fleeing included apprehending escapees before they had the opportunity to band together.Schwartz, Stuart B.

Amerindians were sometimes utilized as ‚Äòslave catchers‚Äô or as part of a larger set of defenses against slave uprisings that had been orchestrated by cities and towns.Schwartz, Stuart B. (1992). \\"Rethinking Palmares: Slave Resistance in Colonial Brazil\\". Slaves, peasants, and rebels : reconsidering Brazilian slavery. Urbana: University of Illinois Press. p. 4. . OCLC 857899745. At the same time, some Amerindians resisted the colonizers‚Äô efforts to prevent uprisings by surreptitiously incorporating into their villages those who had escaped slavery. Many of the details surrounding the inner political and social structure of the quilombos remain a mystery, and the information available today is limited by the fact that it usually comes from colonial accounts of their destruction. We know more about the Quilombo dos Palmares because it was \\"the longest-lived and largest fugitive community\\" in Colonial Brazil. Like any polity, Palmares and other quilombos changed over time. Quilombos drew on both African and European influences, often emulating the realities of colonial society in Brazil. In Palmares, slavery, which also existed in Africa, continued. Quilombos, like plantations, were most likely composed of people from different African groups. Religious syncretism, combining African and Christian elements, was prevalent. The Bahian quilombo of Buraco de Tatu is described as a \\"well-organized\\" village in which people probably practiced monogamy and lived on rectangular-shaped houses that made up neat rows, emulating a plantation senzala. Quilombos were often well fortified, with swampy dikes and false roads leading to \\"covered traps\\" and \\"sharpened stakes,\\" like those used in Africa. The gender imbalance among African slaves was a result of the planters' preference for male labor, and men in quilombos not only raided for crops and goods, but for women; the women taken back to the quilombos were often black or mulatto. In Minas Gerais, the mining economy particularly favored the formation of quilombos. The skilled slaves that worked in mines were highly valuable to their owners, but, as long as they continued to cede their findings, they were often allowed freedom of movement within the mining districts. Slaves and freed blacks made up to three-fourths of the region's population, and runaways could easily hide among the \\"sea of coloreds.\\" The region's mountains and large tracts of unsettled land, provided potential hideouts. Civil unrest combined with other forms of resistance against the colonial government severely hindered the anti-quilombo efforts of slaveowners and local authorities. In fact, to the dismay of colonial authorities, slaves participated in these anti-government movements, often armed by their owners. As mentioned, indigenous people could be both allies and enemies of runaway slaves. From the late 1500s and as late as 1627, in southern Bahia, a \\"syncretic Messianic religion\\" called Santidade gained popularity among both indigenous people and runaway slaves, who joined forces and carried out raids in the region, even stealing slaves from Salvador. Inland expansion: the entradas and bandeiras Albert Eckhout Tapuias dancing, mid. 17th century Since the 16th century the exploration of the Brazilian inland was attempted several times, mostly to try to find mineral riches like the silver mines found in 1546 by the Spanish in Potos√≠ (now in Bolivia). Since no riches were initially found, colonisation was restricted to the coast where the climate and soil were suitable for sugarcane plantations. Key to understanding inland expansion in Brazil is understanding the colony's economic structure. Brazil was constructed as an export colony, and less so as a place for permanent European settlement. This led to a culture of extraction that was unsustainable in terms of land and labor uses. At sugar plantations in the north, land was worked exhaustively with no concern for ensuring its long-term productivity. As soon as the land was exhausted, plantation owners would simply abandon their plots, shifting the sugar frontier to new plots as the supply of land seemed endless to them. Economic incentives to increase profits drove this pattern of planting, while the abandoned lands rarely recovered. The expeditions to inland Brazil are divided into two types: the entradas and the bandeiras. The entradas were done in the name of the Portuguese crown and were financed by the colonial government. Its main objective was to find mineral riches, as well as to explore and chart unknown territory. The bandeiras, on the other hand, were private initiatives sponsored and carried out mostly by settlers of the S√£o Paulo region (the Paulistas). The expeditions of the bandeirantes, as these adventurers were called, were aimed at obtaining native slaves for trade and finding mineral riches. Banderia expeditions often consisted of a field officer, his slaves, a chaplain, a scribe, a mapmaker, white colonists, livestock, and medical professionals, among others. In several-month-long marches, such groups entered lands that were not yet occupied by colonizers by were doubtless part of the homelands of Amerindians. The Paulistas, who at the time were mostly of mixed Portuguese and native ancestry, knew all the old indigenous pathways (the ) through the Brazilian inland and were acclimated to the harsh conditions of these journeys.Richard M. Morse, ed. The Bandereintes: The Historical Role of the Brazilian Pathfinders. New York 1965. At the end of the 17th century, the bandeirantes expeditions discovered gold in central Brazil, in the region of Minas Gerais, which started a gold rush that led to a dramatic urban development of inland Brazil during the 18th century. Additionally, inland expeditions led to westward expansion of the frontiers of colonial Brazil, beyond the limits established by the Treaty of Tordesillas. = Racial mixing and cultural exchange along the frontier = When white fugitives fleeing tax collectors, military enlistment, and the law entered the backlands of Atlantic Forest, they formed racially-mixed settlements that became sites of \\"cultural and genetic exchange\\". Some tribes like the Caiapo managed to fend off the Europeans for years, while adopting Old World agricultural practices. However, the expansion of the mining frontier pushed many indigenous tribes off their land. An increasing number of them went to the aldeias to evade the threat of enslavement by colonists or conflicts with other indigenous groups. In 1755, in an attempt to transform this wandering population into a more productive, assimilated peasantry modeled on Europe's own peasants, the marquis of Pombal abolished the enslavement of natives and legal discrimination against the Europeans who married them, banning the use of the term caboclo, a pejorative used to refer to a mestizo or a detribalized indigenous person. Along the frontier, racial mixing between people of indigenous, European, and African ancestry resulted in various physical spaces for cultural interchange that historian Warren Dean has called the \\"caboclo frontier\\". Portuguese colonial authorities were characterized by their refusal to cooperate or negotiate with quilombos, seeing them as a threat to the social order (Schwartz 4), but caboclo settlements integrated the indigenous into what Darren describes as \\"neo-European customs [or an Africanized version of them]\\". Runaway slaves, forming quilombos or finding refuge in the backlands of the forest, came into contact with indigenous people and introduced them to the Portuguese language. Frontier army agent Guido Thomaz Marli√®re noted: \\"A fugitive black can accomplish more among the Indians than all the missionaries together...\\" One quilombo in specific, Piolho, was \\"officially tolerated\\" for its ability to pacify indigenous tribes. At the same time, colonial officials disapproved of unions between runaway black slaves and indigenous people. In 1771, when an indigenous captain-major of an aldeia married an African woman, he was dismissed from his position. The inhabitants of the caboclo frontier exchanged belief systems, musical traditions, remedies, fishing and hunting techniques, and other customs with each other. The Tupi language enriched Portuguese with new words for native flora and fauna, as well as for places. Africanisms, such as the Kimbundu word fub√† (maize meal) also became part of Brazilian Portuguese.  Black Irmandade of Bahia, Brazil  The Black Irmandade was the result of the blacks and mulattos beginning to create custom and culture. Although Blacks were considered of ‚Äúthe lowest rabble‚Äù, their agricultural skills and that they came from Europe along with the white Europeans gave them an upper hand in social ranking. These Afro-Portuguese blacks developed a complex culture that can best be highlighted through their celebrations and festivities that took place in Bahia, Brazil. In these festivities lies a combination of African beliefs and practices with not only a Christian impact but also the impact of living in a new land. The Irmandade put a large value on the extensiveness of one's burial as to die alone and ‚Äúanonymously‚Äù would be a representation of a poor person. The Irmandade of Bahia, Brazil, highlights the rising racial and cultural complexity that would take place between the native indigenous, African slaves, and white Europeans in the years to come.  Initial Findings of Gold (17th century)  While the first major gold deposits were found at the end of the 17th century, there is record of gold being found in the area of S√£o Vicente in the end of the 16th century. In the century or so between these initial sightings of gold and the first findings of major gold deposits, not much revenue was made, but two important modes of interacting with gold in Brazil came into place. Firstly, in the initial goldfields and smelting houses run by the Portuguese monarchy, the crown forced indigenous people into slave labor. Hundreds of thousands of people were shipped from Africa to be enslaved to work in mines by the end of the 17th century, but this process began with a couple hundred indigenous people enslaved into the gold industry at the first ventures for gold by the Crown in Brazil a century earlier. Secondly, people referred to as faiscadores or garimpeiros illegally prospected and mined for gold, dodging Portuguese taxes on precious metals. Prospectors illegally mining gold separate from the Portuguese crown was a problem for the monarchy for over a hundred years after the beginning of gold mining in Brazil. The gold cycle (18th century) View of Ouro Preto, one of the main Portuguese settlements founded during the gold rush of Minas Gerais. The town has preserved its colonial appearance to this day. The discovery of gold was met with great enthusiasm by Portugal, which had an economy in disarray following years of wars against Spain and the Netherlands. A gold rush quickly ensued, with people from other parts of the colony and Portugal flooding the region in the first half of the 18th century. The large portion of the Brazilian inland where gold was extracted became known as the Minas Gerais (General Mines). Gold mining in this area became the main economic activity of colonial Brazil during the 18th century. In Portugal, the gold was mainly used to pay for industrialized goods (textiles, weapons) obtained from countries like England and, especially during the reign of King John V, to build magnificent Baroque monuments like the Convent of Mafra. Apart from gold, diamond deposits were also found in 1729 around the village of Tijuco, now Diamantina. A famous figure in Brazilian history of this era was Xica da Silva, a slave woman who had a long-term relationship in Diamantina with a Portuguese official; the couple had thirteen children and she died a rich woman.J√∫nia Ferreira Furtado, Chica da Silva: A Brazilian Slave of the Eighteenth Century. New York: Cambridge University Press 2009. In the hilly landscape of Minas Gerais, gold was present in alluvial deposits around streams and was extracted using pans and other similar instruments that required little technology. Gold extraction was mostly done by slaves. The Gold industry brought hundreds of thousands of Africans to Brazil as slaves. The Portuguese Crown allowed particulars to extract the gold, requiring a fifth (20%) of the gold (the quinto) to be sent to the colonial government as tribute. To prevent smuggling and extract the quinto, in 1725 the government ordered all gold to be cast into bars in the Casas de Fundi√ß√£o (Casting Houses), and sent armies to the region to prevent disturbances and oversee the mining process. The Royal tribute was very unpopular in Minas Gerais, and gold was frequently hidden from colonial authorities. Eventually, the quinto contributed to rebellious movements like the Levante de Vila Rica, in 1720, and the Inconfid√™ncia Mineira, in 1789 (see below). National Archives of Brazil Some historians mention that the trade deficit of Portugal in relation to England while the Methuen Treaty was in force has also contributed to redirect much of the gold mined in Brazil during the 18th century to Britain. The Methuen Treaty was a trade treaty signed between England and Portugal, by which all woolen cloth imported from Britain would be tax-free in Portugal, whereas Portuguese wine exported to Britain would be taxed at one- third of the previous import tax on wines. Port wine became increasingly popular in Britain at that time, but cloth amounted to a larger share of the trade value than wines, hence Portugal eventually incurred in trade deficit with England. The large number of adventurers coming to the Minas Gerais led to the foundation of several settlements, the first of which was created in 1711: Vila Rica de Ouro Preto, Sabar√° and Mariana, followed by S√£o Jo√£o del Rei (1713), Serro, Caet√© (1714), Pitangui (1715) and S√£o Jos√© do Rio das Mortes (1717, now Tiradentes). In contrast to other regions of colonial Brazil, people coming to Minas Gerais settled mostly in villages instead of the countryside. In 1763, the capital of colonial Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro, which was located closer to the mining region and provided a harbor to ship the gold to Europe. According to the historian Maria Marc√≠lio, \\"In 1700 Portugal had a population of about two million people. During the eighteenth century, approximately 400,000 left for [the Portuguese colony of] Brazil, despite efforts by the crown to place severe restrictions on emigration.\\"Marc√≠lio, Maria Luiza. \\"The Population of Colonial Brazil.\\" The Cambridge History of Latin America. Edited by Leslie Bethell. Cambridge University Press, 1984. p. 47. (in English). . Gold production declined towards the end of the 18th century, beginning a period of relative stagnation of the Brazilian hinterland. =Colonization of the South= 18th century-S√£o Jos√© Fortress near left In an attempt to expand the borders of colonial Brazil and profit from the silver mines of Potos√≠, the Portuguese Overseas Council (the Conselho Ultramarino) ordered colonial governor Manuel Lobo to establish a settlement on the shore of the River Plate, in a region that legally belonged to Spain. In 1679, Manuel Lobo founded Colonia de Sacramento on the margin opposite to Buenos Aires. The fortified settlement quickly became an important point of illegal commerce between the Spanish and Portuguese colonies. Spain and Portugal fought over the enclave on several occasions (1681, 1704, 1735). In addition to Colonia de Sacramento, several settlements were established in Southern Brazil in the late 17th and 18th century, some with peasants from the Azores Islands. The towns founded in this period include Curitiba (1668), Florian√≥polis (1675), Rio Grande (1736), Porto Alegre (1742) and others, and helped keep southern Brazil firmly under Portuguese control. The conflicts over the Southern colonial frontiers led to the signing of the Treaty of Madrid (1750), in which Spain and Portugal agreed to a considerable Southwestward expansion of colonial Brazil. According to the treaty, Colonia de Sacramento was to be given to Spain in exchange for the territories of S√£o Miguel das Miss√µes, a region occupied by Jesuit missions dedicated to evangelizing the Guaran√≠ natives. Resistance by the Jesuits and the Guaran√≠ led to the Guaran√≠ War (1756), in which Portuguese and Spanish troops destroyed the Missions. Colonia de Sacramento kept changing hands until 1777, when it was definitively conquered by the colonial governor of Buenos Aires. Quartered body of Tiradentes, by Brazilian painter Pedro Am√©rico (1893) =Inconfid√™ncia Mineira= In 1788/89, Minas Gerais was the setting of the most important conspiracy against colonial authorities, the so-called Inconfid√™ncia Mineira, inspired by the ideals of the French liberal philosophers of the Age of Enlightenment and the successful American Revolution of 1776. The conspirators largely belonged to the white upper class of Minas Gerais.Kenneth P. Maxwell, Conflicts and Conspiracies: Brazil and Portugal, 1750-1808. New York: Cambridge University Press 1973. Many had studied in Europe, especially in the University of Coimbra, and some had large debts with the colonial government. In the context of declining gold production, the intention of the Portuguese government to impose the obligatory payment of all debts (the derrama) was a leading cause behind the conspiracy. The conspirators wanted to create a Republic in which the leader would be chosen through democratic elections. The capital would be S√£o Jo√£o del Rei, and Ouro Preto would become a university town. The structure of the society, including the right to property and the ownership of slaves, would be kept intact. The conspiracy was discovered by the Portuguese colonial government in 1789, before the planned military rebellion could take place. Eleven of the conspirators were exiled to Portuguese colonial possessions in Angola, but Joaquim Jos√© da Silva Xavier, nicknamed Tiradentes, was sentenced to death. Tiradentes was hanged in Rio de Janeiro in 1792, drawn and quartered, and his body parts displayed in several towns. He later became a symbol of the struggle for Brazilian independence and liberty from Portuguese rule. The Inconfid√™ncia Mineira was not the only rebellious movement in colonial Brazil against the Portuguese. Later, in 1798, there was the Inconfid√™ncia Baiana in Salvador. In this episode, which had more participation of common people, four people were hanged, and 41 were jailed. Members included slaves, middle-class people and even some landowners.  Colonial transformation of the Brazilian environment  Colonial practices destroyed much of the Brazilian forest. This was made possible in part by colonial conceptions of the natural world as a disposable collection of utilities with no inherent value. Mining practices significantly harmed the land. To facilitate the extraction of gold, in some regions large swaths of forest along hillsides were burned. (Dean, 95) 4,000 square kilometers of the Atlantic Forest region were denuded for mining, leaving the terrain ‚Äúbald and deserted.‚Äù (Dean, 97). This massive destruction of the natural environment was a consequence of the colonial culture of extraction and unsustainability. As the gold rush subsided, many Portuguese colonists abandoned mining for farming and animal husbandry. Farming practices extended inland expansion farther into the Brazilian forest. The colonists began to set in motion what became a nearly unstoppable trend with profound cumulative effects. The Portuguese colonists‚Äô decisions to pursue the economic strategy of agriculture and to adopt particular agricultural practices significantly transformed the Brazilian environment. The Portuguese colonists understood farming as a beneficial taming of the frontier, urging mestizos, mulattoes, and indigenes to abandon life in the wild forest and adopt agriculture. Colonial farming practices in the forest were unsustainable, greatly exploiting the land. Slash-and-burn practices were used liberally, and colonial responses to the presence of the ant genus Atta encouraged both large-scale abandonment of fields and extensive clearing of additional lands. Atta effectively resisted agriculture. In only a few years, the ants constructed elaborate and complex colonies that colonists found nearly impossible to destroy and that made hoeing and plowing extremely difficult. Instead of fighting the ants, colonists ceded their fields to the ants, created new fields through burning, then a few years later ceded their new fields to the ants. This environmental transformation contrasted sharply with Brazilian Amerindian land-management concepts and practices. Unlike in many areas of Central and South America, in Brazil Amerindians did not significantly disrupt and damage biotic communities. Amerindians maintained very small communities, and their total numbers were small. In addition, they prioritized the long-term agricultural productivity of the land, utilizing cultivation, hunting, and gathering practices that were sustainable. The introduction of European livestock‚Äîcattle, horses, and pigs‚Äîalso radically transformed the land. Indigenous flora in the interior of Brazil withered and died in the face of repeated trampling by cattle; the flora were replaced by grasses able to adapt to such abuse. Cattle also overgrazed fertile fields, killing vegetation that was able to survive extensive trampling. Scrubby noxious plants, some of which were poisonous, replaced this vegetation. Colonists responded to these unwanted plants by burning innumerable large pastures, a practice that killed countless small animals and greatly damaged soil nutrients. = Challenges to the sustainability and the growth of agriculture = The mining of gold and diamonds shaped the internal economy of agriculture. Although slash-and-burn agriculture was able to feed the mining region throughout the 1700s, deforestation and the degradation of the land in the long term, made farming increasingly difficult and forced farmers to look for grasses further away from these mining centers. As a result, by 1800, foodstuffs were carried on mule trains as far as 100 kilometers just to reach Ouro Preto. Although the colonial authorities encouraged the mining industry, like the Jesuits before them, they also noticed the negative effects of slash-and-burn agriculture. In 1765, Luis Antonio Souza Botelho became the governor of the captaincy of S√£o Paulo. He attempted to stop slash-and-burn agriculture through the imposition of a village social order. Botelho encouraged mestizos, mulattos, assimilated indigenous people, and Paulista farmers to take up the plow and use the manure of draft animals as fertilizer, but his reforms did not work for several reasons. Botelho's propositions did not appeal to farmers because farmers would have to work more hours without any guarantee or probability of actually increasing their harvest. The colonial land policy favored the elite, who could afford purchasing expensive land titles. Because these small-scale farmers were unable to attain land titles to make their fields their property, they were uninvested in sustainable farming practices. Botelho also saw slavery as a hindrance to the agricultural development of the region. Although his reforms were unsuccessful and he was not able to implement all of his ideas, Botelho did recognize that mercantilism and militarism impeded the growth of agriculture. Other impediments to the growth of agriculture, included the criminalization and vilification of the poor. Heavy taxes were expected in cash from poor farmers. While reimbursements could be delayed for years, when taxes were not paid, the family's young men were forced into military service. One governor in Minas Gerais noted with dismay that white settlers seemed to reject all forms of intensive manual labor in the hopes of increasing their chances at upward social mobility. Botelho, himself, \\"conscripted almost 5,000 men from an adult population that could not have numbered more than 35,000.\\" Unemployed men were designated as vadios or vagamundos and enlisted in the military or sent to the frontier along convicts. Some of the men managed to escape the authorities and found refuge in the Atlantic forest, where they became subsistence farmers or prospectors; these men would later come to form part of the \\"caboclo frontier.\\" The pests and plagues that invaded farmers' crops were a significant barrier to the growth of agriculture. Rodents, insects, and birds ate many crops, but the most pervasive pests were the leaf-cutting ants, or sa√∫va (in Tupi). These ants are difficult to eliminate as, even today, they are difficult to study because they work at night and live below the ground. Farmers at that time, were unsure on how to deal with sa√∫va, and unfortunately, resorted to countermeasures, like slash-and-burn, that only exacerbated the problem.  Cattle raising  As with agriculture, the mining economy shaped the cattle raising industry from its outset. Beef was eaten by miners and was \\"the preferred source of protein in the neo-European diet\\" of Colonial Brazil. Cattle raising spread from Sao Paulo to the Gaurapuava plains. Cattle were not particularly cared for. No fodder was provided, and even castrating and branding were often neglected. As a result, there was a severe mortality rate during the dry season, and it took several years for cattle to reach a sellable weight. Salt served as a poor dietary supplement for cattle, and this inadequate use, simply made salt-preserved meats and dairy products \\"unnecessarily expensive.\\" Catte suffered from intestinal parasites and ticks. In their attempts to escape pests and threats, they often moved into forest margins, disrupting their ecosystems. As mentioned, cattle raising changed the native landscape from palatable grasses to \\"scrubby, noxious\\" plants, but trying to eliminate them by burning only worked temporarily. In the long term, burning these grasses caused erosion, reduced soil permeability, and produced degraded, innutritious pasture prone to becoming hosting ticks and poisonous plant species. Cattle took longer to reach their weight, and by choosing the largest animals, herders only worsened the breed through \\"negative selective pressure.\\" Although they were edible and fire-resistant, the African grasses that eventually replaced native ones were not as nutritious because they were not planted in variety to provide a more balanced diet. Because of degraded grasslands, high mortality rate, slow growth, and low population, like agriculture, the cattle raising industry in Colonial Brazil was not very productive. In fact, hunter-gathers in this area could have attained more meat than the cattle breeders, who annually produced a maximum of \\"five kilograms of meat per hectare.\\" Thus, wasteful agricultural practices and irresponsible cattle raising methods not only led to the degradation of the native landscape; they also did little for the long-term economic development of the region. Historian Warren Dean acknowledges the effects that colonialism and capitalism had on the seemingly \\"useless\\" and \\"wasteful\\" exploitation of the Atlantic Forest, yet he also warns the reader against ascribing the whole blame on colonialism and capitalism. According to Dean, there is evidence to suggest colonists accepted \\"regal authority\\" only when it supported their interests and that \\"colonies were not necessarily condemned to [lower] levels of capital formation.\\" \\"Resistance to the demands of imperialism,\\" says Dean, can have as \\"forceful and determinant [of an effect on] the formation of states and nations as imperialism itself.\\" The Royal Court in Brazil (1808‚Äì1821) The Spanish and Portuguese empires in 1790Declaration of war made by Prince Regent John to Napoleon Bonaparte and all his vassals, 1808 Dimension of Brazil in 1821 with Kingdom of Portugal Brazil and Algarves (Source) National Library of Portugal (link \\"map\\") http://purl.pt/880/3/ - (general website) \\"link\\" http://www.bnportugal.gov.pt The Napoleonic invasion of the Iberian peninsula set off major changes there and in both Portugal's and Spain's overseas empires. In 1807 French troops of Napoleon Bonaparte invaded Britain's ally, Portugal. Prince Regent Jo√£o (future King Jo√£o VI), who had governed since 1792 on behalf of his mother, Queen Maria I, ordered the transfer of the Portuguese royal court to Brazil before he could be deposed by the invading army. In January 1808, Prince Jo√£o and his court arrived in Salvador, where he signed a commercial regulation that opened commerce between Brazil and friendly nations (Britain). This important law broke the colonial pact that, until then, allowed Brazil to maintain direct commercial relations with only Portugal.A.J.R. Russell-Wood, ed. From Colony to Nation: Essays on the Independence of Brazil. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press 1975.Jos√© Hon√≥rio Rodrigues. Independ√™ncia: Revolu√ßƒÅo e contra-revolu√ß√£o. Rio de Janeiro 1976. In March 1808, the court arrived in Rio de Janeiro. In 1815, during the Congress of Vienna, Prince Jo√£o created the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves (Reino Unido de Portugal, Brasil e Algarves), elevating Brazil to the rank of Portugal and increasing its administrative independence. In 1816, with the death of Queen Maria, Prince Jo√£o succeeded as monarch, and the ceremony of his acclamation was held in Rio de Janeiro in February 1818. Among the important measures taken by Prince Jo√£o in his years in Brazil were incentives to commerce and industry, the permission to print newspapers and books, the creation of two medicine schools, military academies, and the first Bank of Brazil (Banco do Brasil). In Rio de Janeiro he also created a powder factory, a Botanical Garden, an art academy (Escola Nacional de Belas Artes) and an opera house (Teatro S√£o Jo√£o). All these measures greatly advanced the independence of Brazil in relation to Portugal and made the later political separation between the two countries inevitable. The Pa√ßo Imperial, an 18th-century colonial palace located in Rio de Janeiro, used as a dispatch house by King Jo√£o VI of Portugal and later by his son, Emperor Pedro I of Brazil. Due to the absence of the King and the economic independence of Brazil, Portugal entered a severe crisis that obliged Jo√£o VI and the royal family to return to Portugal in 1821: a Liberal Revolution had broken out in Portugal in 1820, and the royal governors who ruled Portugal in the King's name had been replaced by a revolutionary Council of Regency formed to govern the European portion of the kingdom until the King's return. Indeed, the King's immediate return to Lisbon was one of the main demands of the Revolution. Under the revolutionary Council of Regency, a constituent assembly, known as the Portuguese Constitutional Courts (Cortes Constitucionais Portuguesas), was elected to abolish the absolute monarchy and replace it with a constitutional one. King Jo√£o VI, then, yielding to pressure, returned to Europe. Brazilian representatives were elected to join the deliberations of the Constitutional Cortes of the kingdom. The heir of Jo√£o VI, Prince Pedro, remained in Brazil. The Portuguese Cortes demanded that Brazil return to its former condition of colony and that the heir return to Portugal. Prince Pedro, influenced by the Rio de Janeiro Municipal Senate (Senado da C√¢mara), refused to return to Portugal in the famous Dia do Fico (January 9, 1822). Political independence came on September 7, 1822, and the prince was crowned emperor in Rio de Janeiro as Dom Pedro I, ending 322 years of dominance of Portugal over Brazil.

The separation is recognized by Portugal in 1825. The detailed history of the administrative changes in the administration of colonial Brazil is as follows: From 1534 (immediately after the start the Portuguese attempts to effectively colonize Brazil) until 1549, Brazil was divided by the Portuguese Crown in private and autonomous colonies known as hereditary captaincies (capitanias heredit√°rias), or captaincy colonies (col√≥nias capitanias). In 1549, Portuguese King John III abolished the system of private colonies, and the fifteen existing hereditary captaincies were incorporated into a single Crown colony, the Governorate General of Brazil. The individual captaincies, now under the administration of the Portuguese Crown (and no longer called colonies or hereditary captaincies, but simply captaincies of Brazil), continued to exist as provinces or districts within the colony until the end of the colonial era in 1815. The unified Governorate General of Brazil, with its capital city in Salvador, existed during three periods: from 1549 to 1572, from 1578 to 1607 and from 1613 to 1621. Between 1572 and 1578 and again between 1607 and 1613, the colony was split in two, and during those periods the Governorate General of Brazil did not exist, being replaced by two separate Governorates: the Governorate General of Bahia, in the North, with its seat in the city of Salvador, and the Governorate General of Rio de Janeiro, in the South, with its seat in the city of Rio de Janeiro. In 1621, an administrative reorganization took place, and the Governorate General of Brazil became known as the State of Brazil (Estado do Brasil), keeping Salvador as its capital city. With this administrative remodeling, the unity of the colony was once again interrupted, as a portion of territory in the northern part of modern Brazil became an autonomous colony, separate from the State of Brazil: the State of Maranh√£o, with its capital city in S√£o Luiz. In 1652, the State of Maranh√£o was extinguished, and its territory was briefly added to the State of Brazil, reunifying the colonial administration once more. However, in 1654, the territories of the former State of Maranh√£o were again separated from the State of Brazil, and the Captaincy of Gr√£o-Par√° was also split from Brazil. In this restructuring, the territories of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o, severed from Brazil, were united in a single State, initially named as State of Maranh√£o and Gr√£o-Par√°, having S√£o Luiz as its capital city. This newly created State incorporated territories recently acquired by the Portuguese west of the Tordesillas line. In 1751, the State of Maranh√£o and Gr√£o-Par√° was renamed as the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o, and its capital city as transferred from S√£o Luiz (in Maranh√£o) to Bel√©m (in the part of the State that was then known as Gr√£o-Par√°). In 1763, the capital city of the State of Brazil was transferred from Salvador to Rio de Janeiro. At the same time, the title of the King's representative heading the government of the State of Brazil was officially changed from Governor General to Viceroy (Governors coming from the high nobility had been using the title of Viceroy since about 1640). However, the name of Brazil was never changed to Viceroyalty of Brazil. That title, although sometimes used by modern writers, is not proper, as the colony continued to be titled State of Brazil. In 1772, in a short-lived territorial reorganization, the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Maranh√£o was split in two: the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Rio Negro (better known simply as the State of Gr√£o- Par√°), with the city of Bel√©m as its capital, and the State of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠ (better known simply as the State of Maranh√£o), with its seat in the city of S√£o Luiz. Thus from 1772 until another territorial reorganization in 1775 there were three distinct Portuguese States in South America: the State of Brazil, the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Rio Negro, and the State of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠. In 1775, in a final territorial reorganization, the colony was once again reunified: the State of Maranh√£o and Piau√≠ and the State of Gr√£o-Par√° and Rio Negro were both abolished, and their territories were incorporated into the territory of the State of Brazil. The State of Brazil was thus expanded; it became the sole Portuguese State in South America; and it now included in its territory the whole of the Portuguese possessions in the American Continent. Indeed, with the reorganization of 1775, for the first time since 1654, all the Portuguese territories in the New World were once again united under a single colonial government. Rio de Janeiro, that had become the capital of the State of Brazil in 1763, continued to be the capital, now of the unified colony. In 1808, the Portuguese Court was transferred to Brazil as direct consequence of the invasion of Portugal during the Napoleonic Wars. The office of Viceroy of Brazil ceased to exist upon the arrival of the Royal Family in Rio de Janeiro, since the Prince Regent, the future King Jonh VI, assumed personal control of the government of the colony, that became the provisional seat of the whole Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil ceased to be a colony, upon the elevation of the State of Brazil to the rank of a kingdom, the Kingdom of Brazil, and the simultaneous political union of that kingdom with the Kingdoms of Portugal and the Algarves, forming a single sovereign State, the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves. That political union would last until 1822 when Brazil declared its independence from the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves and became the Empire of Brazil, a sovereign nation in the territory of the former Kingdom of Brazil. The separation was recognized by Portugal with the signing of the 1825 Treaty of Rio de Janeiro. With the creation of the Kingdom of Brazil in 1815, the former captaincies of the State of Brazil became provinces within the new Kingdom, and after independence, they became the provinces of the Empire of Brazil.

He is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Andy Dufresne in the film The Shawshank Redemption (1994). His other roles include starring as Norville Barnes in The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Nuke LaLoosh in Bull Durham (1988), Jacob Singer in Jacob's Ladder (1990), Griffin Mill in The Player (1992), Dave Boyle in Mystic River (2003), for which he won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, and Harlan Ogilvy in War of the Worlds (2005). He also directed the films Bob Roberts (1992) and Dead Man Walking (1995), both of which were well received. He received an Academy Award nomination for Best Director for Dead Man Walking. For television, he played Secretary of State Walter Larson in the HBO comedy The Brink (2015), and in Here and Now (2018) portrayed Greg Boatwright.  Early life  Robbins was born in West Covina, California, and raised in New York City. His parents were Mary Cecelia (n√©e Bledsoe), a musicianhttps://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/tim-robbins-mother-musician- mary-179995 and Gilbert Lee Robbins, a singer, actor, and manager of The Gaslight Cafe. Robbins has two sisters, Adele and Gabrielle, and a brother, composer David Robbins. He was raised Catholic.: (Commentary with Tim Robbins saying; \\"Yes. We, we met. And I was raised a Catholic, so I have a whole other perception of nuns than, than the one that Sister Helen gave me.\\") He moved to Greenwich Village with his family at a young age, while his father pursued a career as a member of the folk music group, The Highwaymen. Robbins started performing in theater at age twelve and joined the drama club at Stuyvesant High School (Class of 1976). He spent two years at SUNY Plattsburgh and then returned to California to study at the UCLA Film School, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Drama in 1981.  Career  Robbins's acting career began at Theater for the New City, where he spent his teenage years in their Annual Summer Street Theater and also played the title role in a musical adaptation of Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry's The Little Prince. After graduation from college in 1981, Robbins founded the Actors' Gang, an experimental theater group, in Los Angeles with actor friends from his college softball team (including John Cusack). In 1982, he appeared as domestic terrorist Andrew Reinhardt in three episodes of the television program St. Elsewhere. In 1985, he guest-starred in the second episode of the television series Moonlighting, \\"Gunfight at the So-So Corral\\". He also took parts in films, such as the role of frat animal \\"Mother\\" in Fraternity Vacation (1985) and Lt Sam \\"Merlin\\" Wells in the fighter pilot film Top Gun (1986). He appeared on The Love Boat, as a young version of one of the characters in retrospection about the Second World War. His breakthrough role was as pitcher Ebby Calvin \\"Nuke\\" LaLoosh in the baseball film Bull Durham (1988), in which he co-starred with Susan Sarandon and Kevin Costner. Robbins' amoral film executive in Robert Altman's film The Player (1992) was described by Peter Travers in Rolling Stone as \\"a classic performance, mining every comic and lethal nuance in the role of his career\\". He won the Best Actor Award at Cannes. He made his directorial and screenwriting debut with Bob Roberts (also 1992), a mockumentary about a right-wing senatorial candidate. Todd McCarthy in Variety commented that the film is \\"both a stimulating social satire and, for thinking people, a depressing commentary on the devolution of the American political system\\". Robbins then starred alongside Morgan Freeman in The Shawshank Redemption (1994), which was based on Stephen King's novella. Robbins at Cannes, 2001 Robbins has written, produced, and directed several films with strong social content, such as the capital punishment saga Dead Man Walking (1995), starring Sarandon and Sean Penn. The film earned him an Oscar nomination for Best Director. According to Roger Ebert in early 1996: \\"With this film he leaps far beyond\\" Bob Roberts \\"and has made that rare thing, a film that is an exercise of philosophy. This is the kind of movie that spoils us for other films, because it reveals so starkly how most movies fall into conventional routine, and lull us with the reassurance that they will not look too hard, or probe too deeply, or make us think beyond the boundaries of what is comfortable\\". His next directorial effort was Depression-era musical Cradle Will Rock (1999). Robbins has also appeared in mainstream Hollywood thrillers, such as Arlington Road (also 1999) as a suspected terrorist and Antitrust (2001) as a malicious computer tycoon, and in comical films such as The Hudsucker Proxy (1994), Nothing to Lose (1997), and High Fidelity (2000). Robbins has also acted in and directed several Actors' Gang theater productions. Robbins won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar and the SAG Award for his work in Mystic River (2003), as a man traumatized from having been molested as a child. He followed his Oscar-win with roles as a temporarily blind man who is nursed to health by a psychologically wounded young woman in The Secret Life of Words (2005) and an apartheid torturer in Catch a Fire (2006). As of 2006, he was the tallest Academy Award-winning actor at . In early 2006, Robbins directed an adaptation of George Orwell's novel 1984, written by Michael Gene Sullivan of the Tony Award-winning San Francisco Mime Troupe. The production opened at Actors' Gang, at their new location at The Ivy Substation in Culver City, California. In addition to venues around the United States, it has played in Athens, Greece, the Melbourne International Festival in Australia and the Hong Kong Arts Festival. Robbins was soon considering a film adaptation. Robbins appeared in The Lucky Ones, with co- star Rachel McAdams as well as City of Ember (both 2008). Robbins next film role was as Senator Hammond, the disapproving father of the film's villain Hector Hammond, in the superhero film Green Lantern (2011). Robbins released the album Tim Robbins & The Rogues Gallery Band (2010), a collection of songs written over the course of 25 years that he ultimately took on a world tour. He was originally offered the chance to record an album in 1992 after the success of his film Bob Roberts, but he declined because he had \\"too much respect for the process\\", having seen his father work so hard as a musician, and because he felt he had nothing to say at the time. Robbins directed two episodes of the HBO series Treme. The series follows the interconnected lives of a group of New Orleanians in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. He helmed the episodes \\"Everything I Do Gonh Be Funky\\" in Season 2 (2011) and \\"Promised Land\\" in Season 3 (2012). Robbins became interested in the show while staying in New Orleans during the filming of Green Lantern. \\"I had the unique experience of watching Treme with locals. It resonated for me immediately, and it resonated for them as well, because they have seen their town get misinterpreted and represented in ridiculous ways,\\" he told The Times-Picayune in 2011. \\"Something about this show was different for them. I appreciated that. I loved the writing and the actors. I loved the environment it's set in. I watched the whole first season in New Orleans, and got in touch with David Simon and said, 'If you guys need a director next year, I'd be happy to do an episode.'\\"Walker, Dave (May 1, 2011). Tim Robbins immersed himself in New Orleans culture before directing Sunday's episode of 'Treme'. The Times- Picayune. Retrieved August 28, 2013. In 2013, he was a member of the jury at the 63rd Berlin International Film Festival.  Personal life  In 1986, Robbins entered into a relationship with actress Susan Sarandon, whom he met on the set of Bull Durham. They have one daughter: Eva Amurri (born March 15, 1985) from Sarandon's previous relationship with Italian director Franco Amurri, and two sons: John \\"Jack\\" Henry (born May 15, 1989) and Miles Robbins (born May 4, 1992). Sarandon, like Robbins, is a lapsed Catholic, and they share liberal political views. The end of Robbins' relationship with Sarandon was announced in late December 2009.Longtime couple Sarandon, Robbins have split msnbc. November 23, 2009 Robbins supported Ralph Nader's 2000 presidential campaign and appeared on stage in character as Bob Roberts during the \\"Nader Rocks the Garden\\" rally at Madison Square Garden.Bob Roberts at Madison Square Garden, Youtube.com In December 2007, Robbins campaigned for Senator John Edwards in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. He delivered a speech critical of Hillary Clinton and the DLC while introducing Bernie Sanders at a 2016 campaign stop. Robbins opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In 2003, a 15th anniversary celebration of Bull Durham at the National Baseball Hall of Fame was canceled by Hall of Fame President Dale Petroskey. Petroskey told Robbins that his stance helped to \\"undermine the U.S. position, which could put our troops in even more danger.\\" Durham co-star Kevin Costner defended Robbins and Sarandon: \\"I think Tim and Susan's courage is the type of courage that makes our democracy work. Pulling back this invite is against the whole principle about what we fight for and profess to be about.\\" Robbins is an avid baseball and ice hockey fan. He supports the New York Mets and the New York Rangers and frequently attends games. In 1995 Robbins did a series of promos for MSG Network advertising upcoming Rangers games, and has narrated a documentary on the 1969 Mets for SNY.

It is part of Oracle's Java Foundation Classes (JFC) - an API for providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for Java programs. Swing was developed to provide a more sophisticated set of GUI components than the earlier Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). Swing provides a look and feel that emulates the look and feel of several platforms, and also supports a pluggable look and feel that allows applications to have a look and feel unrelated to the underlying platform. It has more powerful and flexible components than AWT. In addition to familiar components such as buttons, check boxes and labels, Swing provides several advanced components such as tabbed panel, scroll panes, trees, tables, and lists. Unlike AWT components, Swing components are not implemented by platform-specific code. Instead, they are written entirely in Java and therefore are platform-independent. In December 2008, Sun Microsystems (Oracle's predecessor) released the CSS / FXML based framework that it intended to be the successor to Swing, called JavaFX. History The Internet Foundation Classes (IFC) were a graphics library for Java originally developed by Netscape Communications Corporation and first released on December 16, 1996. On April 2, 1997, Sun Microsystems and Netscape Communications Corporation announced their intention to incorporate IFC with other technologies to form the Java Foundation Classes. The \\"Java Foundation Classes\\" were later renamed \\"Swing.\\" Swing introduced a mechanism that allowed the look and feel of every component in an application to be altered without making substantial changes to the application code. The introduction of support for a pluggable look and feel allows Swing components to emulate the appearance of native components while still retaining the benefits of platform independence. Originally distributed as a separately downloadable library, Swing has been included as part of the Java Standard Edition since release 1.2. The Swing classes and components are contained in the package hierarchy. Development of Swing's successor, JavaFX, started in 2005, and it was officially introduced two years later at JavaOne 2007. JavaFX was open-sourced in 2011 and, in 2012, it became part of the Oracle JDK download. JavaFX is replacing Swing owing to several advantages, including being more lightweight, having CSS styling, sleek design controls, and the use of FXML and Scene Builder. In 2018, JavaFX was made a part of the OpenJDK under the OpenJFX project to increase the pace of its development. Members of the Java Client team that was responsible for Swing included Jeff Dinkins (manager), Georges Saab, Jim Graham, Rick Levenson, Tim Prinzing, Jonni Kanerva, Jeannette Hung, Tom Ball, and Amy Fowler (technical lead). Architecture Swing is a platform-independent, \\"model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller\\" GUI framework for Java, which follows a single-threaded programming model. Additionally, this framework provides a layer of abstraction between the code structure and graphic presentation of a Swing-based GUI. =Foundations= Swing is platform- independent because it is completely written in Java. Complete documentation for all Swing classes can be found in the Java API Guide for Version 6 or the Java Platform Standard Edition 8 API Specification for Version 8. Extensible Swing is a highly modular-based architecture, which allows for the \\"plugging\\" of various custom implementations of specified framework interfaces: Users can provide their own custom implementation(s) of these components to override the default implementations using Java's inheritance mechanism via . Swing is a component-based framework, whose components are all ultimately derived from the class. Swing objects asynchronously fire events, have bound properties, and respond to a documented set of methods specific to the component. Swing components are JavaBeans components, compliant with the JavaBeans specification. Configurable Swing's heavy reliance on runtime mechanisms and indirect composition patterns allows it to respond at run time to fundamental changes in its settings. For example, a Swing-based application is capable of hot swapping its user-interface during runtime. Furthermore, users can provide their own look and feel implementation, which allows for uniform changes in the look and feel of existing Swing applications without any programmatic change to the application code. ; Lightweight UI: Swing's high level of flexibility is reflected in its inherent ability to override the native host operating system (OS)'s GUI controls for displaying itself. Swing \\"paints\\" its controls using the Java 2D APIs, rather than calling a native user interface toolkit. Thus, a Swing component does not have a corresponding native OS GUI component, and is free to render itself in any way that is possible with the underlying graphics GUIs. However, at its core, every Swing component relies on an AWT container, since (Swing's) extends (AWT's) Container. This allows Swing to plug into the host OS's GUI management framework, including the crucial device/screen mappings and user interactions, such as key presses or mouse movements. Swing simply \\"transposes\\" its own (OS- agnostic) semantics over the underlying (OS-specific) components. So, for example, every Swing component paints its rendition on the graphic device in response to a call to component.paint(), which is defined in (AWT) Container. But unlike AWT components, which delegated the painting to their OS-native \\"heavyweight\\" widget, Swing components are responsible for their own rendering. This transposition and decoupling is not merely visual, and extends to Swing's management and application of its own OS-independent semantics for events fired within its component containment hierarchies. Generally speaking, the Swing architecture delegates the task of mapping the various flavors of OS GUI semantics onto a simple, but generalized, pattern to the AWT container. Building on that generalized platform, it establishes its own rich and complex GUI semantics in the form of the model. Loosely coupled and MVC The Swing library makes heavy use of the model‚Äìview‚Äìcontroller software design pattern, which conceptually decouples the data being viewed from the user interface controls through which it is viewed. Because of this, most Swing components have associated models (which are specified in terms of Java interfaces), and the programmers can use various default implementations or provide their own. The framework provides default implementations of model interfaces for all of its concrete components. The typical use of the Swing framework does not require the creation of custom models, as the framework provides a set of default implementations that are transparently, by default, associated with the corresponding child class in the Swing library. In general, only complex components, such as tables, trees and sometimes lists, may require the custom model implementations around the application-specific data structures. To get a good sense of the potential that the Swing architecture makes possible, consider the hypothetical situation where custom models for tables and lists are wrappers over DAO and/or EJB services. Typically, Swing component model objects are responsible for providing a concise interface defining events fired, and accessible properties for the (conceptual) data model for use by the associated JComponent. Given that the overall MVC pattern is a loosely coupled collaborative object relationship pattern, the model provides the programmatic means for attaching event listeners to the data model object. Typically, these events are model centric (ex: a \\"row inserted\\" event in a table model) and are mapped by the JComponent specialization into a meaningful event for the GUI component. For example, the has a model called that describes an interface for how a table would access tabular data. A default implementation of this operates on a two-dimensional array. The view component of a Swing JComponent is the object used to graphically represent the conceptual GUI control. A distinction of Swing, as a GUI framework, is in its reliance on programmatically rendered GUI controls (as opposed to the use of the native host OS's GUI controls). Prior to Java 6 Update 10, this distinction was a source of complications when mixing AWT controls, which use native controls, with Swing controls in a GUI (see Mixing AWT and Swing components). Finally, in terms of visual composition and management, Swing favors relative layouts (which specify the positional relationships between components) as opposed to absolute layouts (which specify the exact location and size of components). This bias towards \\"fluid\\"' visual ordering is due to its origins in the applet operating environment that framed the design and development of the original Java GUI toolkit. (Conceptually, this view of the layout management is quite similar to that which informs the rendering of HTML content in browsers, and addresses the same set of concerns that motivated the former.) =Relationship to AWT= AWT and Swing class hierarchy Since early versions of Java, a portion of the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) has provided platform-independent APIs for user interface components. In AWT, each component is rendered and controlled by a native peer component specific to the underlying windowing system. By contrast, Swing components are often described as lightweight because they do not require allocation of native resources in the operating system's windowing toolkit. The AWT components are referred to as heavyweight components. Much of the Swing API is generally a complementary extension of the AWT rather than a direct replacement. In fact, every Swing lightweight interface ultimately exists within an AWT heavyweight component because all of the top-level components in Swing (, , , and ) extend an AWT top-level container. Prior to Java 6 Update 10, the use of both lightweight and heavyweight components within the same window was generally discouraged due to Z-order incompatibilities. However, later versions of Java have fixed these issues, and both Swing and AWT components can now be used in one GUI without Z-order issues. The core rendering functionality used by Swing to draw its lightweight components is provided by Java 2D, another part of JFC. =Relationship to SWT= The Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) is a competing toolkit originally developed by IBM and now maintained by the Eclipse community. SWT's implementation has more in common with the heavyweight components of AWT. This confers benefits such as more accurate fidelity with the underlying native windowing toolkit, at the cost of an increased exposure to the native platform in the programming model. There has been significant debate and speculation about the performance of SWT versus Swing; some hinted that SWT's heavy dependence on JNI would make it slower when the GUI component and Java need to communicate data, but faster at rendering when the data model has been loaded into the GUI, but this has not been confirmed either way. A fairly thorough set of benchmarks in 2005 concluded that neither Swing nor SWT clearly outperformed the other in the general case. Examples =Hello World= This example Swing application creates a single window with \\"Hello, world!\\" inside: // Hello.java (Java SE 5) import javax.swing.*; public class Hello extends JFrame { public Hello() { super(\\"hello\\"); this.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); this.add(new JLabel(\\"Hello, world!\\")); this.pack(); this.setVisible(true); } public static void main(final String[] args) { new Hello(); } } The first \`import\`' includes all the public classes and interfaces from the ' package. The \`Hello\` class \`extends\` the ' class; the \`JFrame\` class implements a window with a title bar and a close control. The \`'Hello()\` constructor initializes the frame by first calling the superclass constructor, passing the parameter \`\\"hello\\"\`, which is used as the window's title. It then calls the ' method inherited from \`JFrame\` to set the default operation when the close control on the title bar is selected to ' this causes the \`JFrame\` to be disposed of when the frame is closed (as opposed to merely hidden), which allows the Java virtual machine to exit and the program to terminate. Next, a ' is created for the string \\"Hello, world!\\" and the ' method inherited from the superclass is called to add the label to the frame. The ' method inherited from the superclass is called to size the window and lay out its contents. The \`main()\` method is called by the Java virtual machine when the program starts. It instantiates a new \`Hello\` frame and causes it to be displayed by calling the ' method inherited from the superclass with the boolean parameter \`true\`. Once the frame is displayed, exiting the \`main\` method does not cause the program to terminate because the AWT event dispatching thread remains active until all of the Swing top-level windows have been disposed. =Window with Button= The basic example code running on Windows 7 The following is a rather simple Swing-based program. It displays a window (a ) containing a label and a button. import java.awt.FlowLayout; import javax.swing.JButton; import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JLabel; import javax.swing.WindowConstants; import javax.swing.SwingUtilities; public class SwingExample implements Runnable { @Override public void run() { // Create the window JFrame f = new JFrame(\\"Hello, !\\"); // Sets the behavior for when the window is closed f.setDefaultCloseOperation(WindowConstants.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); // Add a layout manager so that the button is not placed on top of the label f.setLayout(new FlowLayout()); // Add a label and a button f.add(new JLabel(\\"Hello, world!\\")); f.add(new JButton(\\"Press me!\\")); // Arrange the components inside the window f.pack(); // By default, the window is not visible. Make it visible. f.setVisible(true); } public static void main(String[] args) { SwingExample se = new SwingExample(); // Schedules the application to be run at the correct time in the event queue. SwingUtilities.invokeLater(se); } } Notice how all instantiation and handling of Swing components are done by creating an instance of the class, which implements the Runnable interface. This is then run on the Event Dispatch Thread by use of the method ), created in the main method (see Swing and thread safety). Although Swing code can be run without using this technique (for instance, by not implementing Runnable and moving all commands from the run method to the main method), it is considered to be good form, as Swing is not thread-safe, meaning that invoking resources from multiple threads can result in thread interference and memory consistency errors.http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/uiswing/concurrency/dispatch.html The Event Dispatch Thread =Another example= In this example let javax.swing.JFrame be super class and add our own widget(s) to it (in this case, a JButton). import javax.swing.JFrame; import javax.swing.JButton; import javax.swing.JOptionPane; import javax.swing.SwingUtilities; import java.awt.event.ActionListener; import java.awt.event.ActionEvent; public class Sample extends JFrame { private final JButton b = new JButton(); public Sample() { super(); this.setTitle(\\"HelloApp\\"); this.getContentPane().setLayout(null); this.setBounds(100, 100, 180, 140); this.add(makeButton()); this.setVisible(true); this.setDefaultCloseOperation(EXIT_ON_CLOSE); } private JButton makeButton() { b.setText(\\"Click me!\\"); b.setBounds(40, 40, 100, 30); b.addActionListener(new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent e) { JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(b, \\"Hello World!\\"); } }); return b; } public static void main(String[] args) { // Swing calls must be run by the event dispatching thread. SwingUtilities.invokeAndWait(() -> new Sample()); } } The layout is set to null using the method since JFrame uses java.awt.BorderLayout as its default layout-manager. With BorderLayout anything which is added to the container is placed in the center and stretched to accommodate any other widgets. Of course, most real world GUI applications would prefer to use a layout-manager instead of placing everything on absolute co-ordinates.

It is located about east of the city of Borgholm on the island √ñland. K√∂pingsvik is known as a tourist center, offering large and modern camping sites. Nearby are the historic sites of Borgholm Castle and Halltorps Estate. K√∂ping (historically) was an important Viking Age port of what is today's Sweden, covering an area of approximately , almost four times larger than the similar site on the island of Bj√∂rk√∂ near Stockholm. K√∂ping was in operation from the 7th to the 13th century. It was also an important center of early Christianity in Sweden. Remains of an unfinished, massive 12th century church long have been excavated as well as the largest collection of the so-called eskilstunakistor, 75 pieces. During the last ten years there have been several small excavations which have confirmed the earlier findings and the importance of the site. Note that these findings are almost unknown to public in Sweden and the ruling view is that little site on Bj√∂rk√∂ is Sweden's \\"oldest town\\". K√∂ping faded away around 1200, and Kalmar took over as the most important harbour town in south-eastern Sweden. K√∂ping is claimed by some amateur historians and historians as a possible alternative to Bj√∂rk√∂ for the location of the old viking village Birka in Sv√≠√ûj√≥√∞ (the ancient name for Sweden). Birka is mentioned in Vita Ansgari and the work of Adam of Bremen. He states that Birka is situated directly north of Jomsborg and directly opposite to Kurland and at the same distance between them. This theory has not been widely accepted.

The word comes from the Italian caff√® e latte , caffelatte or caffellatte , which means \\"coffee & milk\\". The word is also sometimes spelled latt√© or latt√® in English with different kinds of accent marks, which can be a hyperforeignism or a deliberate attempt to indicate that the word is not pronounced according to the rules of English orthography. In northern Europe and Scandinavia, the term caf√© au lait has traditionally been used for the combination of espresso and milk. In France, caf√© latte is mostly known from the original Italian name of the drink (caff√® latte or caffelatte); a combination of espresso and steamed milk equivalent to a \\"latte\\" is in French called grand cr√®me and in German Milchkaffee or (in Austria) Wiener Melange. Variants include the chocolate-flavored mocha or replacing the coffee with another drink base such as masala chai (spiced Indian tea), mate, matcha, turmeric or rooibos; other types of milk, such as soy milk or almond milk, are also used. Origin and history Latte art Coffee and milk have been part of European cuisine since the 17th century. Caff√® e latte, Milchkaffee, caf√© au lait and caf√© con leche are domestic terms of traditional ways of drinking coffee, usually as part of breakfast in the home. Public caf√©s in Europe and the US seem to have no mention of the terms until the 20th century, although Kapuziner is mentioned in Austrian coffee houses in Vienna and Trieste in the 2nd half of 1700s as \\"coffee with cream, spices and sugar\\" (being the origin of the Italian cappuccino). According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the term caff√® e latte was first used in English in 1867 by William Dean Howells in his essay \\"Italian Journeys\\". Kenneth Davids maintains that \\"...breakfast drinks of this kind have existed in Europe for generations, but the (commercial) caff√® version of this drink is an American invention\\". The French term caf√© au lait was used in caf√©s in several countries in western continental Europe from 1900 onward, while the French themselves started using the term caf√© cr√®me for coffee with milk or cream. The Austrian-Hungarian empire (Central Europe) had its own terminology for the coffees being served in coffee houses, while in German homes it was still called Milchkaffee. The Italians used the term caff√® latte domestically, but it is not known from caf√©s like Florian in Venice or any other coffee houses or places where coffee was served publicly. Even when the Italian espresso bar culture bloomed in the years after WW2 both in Italy, and in cities like Vienna and London, espresso and cappuccino are the terms, latte is missing on coffee menus. In Italian latte () means \\"milk\\"‚Äîso ordering a \\"latte\\" in Italy will get the customer a glass of milk.. In Spanish the phrase caf√© con leche (coffee with milk) is used, which is by default served in a medium or large cup whereas the similar cortado (coffee with less milk) is served in a small cup. In English-speaking countries latte is shorthand for caffelatte or caffellatte (from caff√® e latte, \\"coffee and milk\\"), which is similar to the French caf√© au lait, the Spanish caf√© con leche, the Catalan caf√® amb llet or the Portuguese gal√£o. The Caffe Mediterraneum in Berkeley, California claims Lino Meiorin, one of its early owners, \\"invented\\" and \\"made the latte a standard drink\\" in the 1950s. The latte was popularized in Seattle, Washington in the early 1980s. and spread more widely in the early 1990s.. In northern Europe and Scandinavia, a similar \\"trend\\" started in the early 1980s as caf√© au lait became popular again, prepared with espresso and steamed milk. Caff√® latte started replacing this term around 1996‚Äì97, but both names exist side by side, more often more similar than different in preparation. Spelling variations Coffee menus worldwide use a number of spelling variations for words to indicate coffee and milk, often using incorrect accents or a combination of French and Italian terms. Italian is caffellatte (the standard form; caffelatte is a Northern Italian variation), contracted from caff√® latte (with a grave accent over the e), while French is caf√© au lait (with an acute accent); Spanish is caf√© con leche and Portuguese is caf√© com leite. Variants such as caf√© latte, caf√© latt√© and caf√© latt√® are commonly seen in English. A slang name for a caff√® latte is a 'lartay', although this spelling is considered informal and, in many places, impolite and disrespectful to Italian culture. Current use In Italy, caff√® latte is almost always prepared at home, for breakfast only. The coffee is brewed with a stovetop moka pot and poured into a cup containing heated milk. (Unlike the 'international' latte drink, the milk in the Italian original is generally not foamed, and sugar is added by the drinker, if at all). Outside Italy, a caff√® latte is typically prepared in a glass or cup with one standard shot of espresso (either single, , or double, ) and filled with steamed milk, with a layer of foamed milk approximately thick on the top. In the US, a latte is often heavily sweetened, with 3% or even more sugar. A cup of latte with lunch at Merewether Beach, Australia The drink is related to a cappuccino, the difference being that a cappuccino consists of espresso and steamed milk with a thick layer of milk foam. A variant found in Australia and New Zealand similar to the latte is the flat white, which is served in a smaller ceramic cup with the micro-foamed milk. In the United States this beverage is sometimes referred to as a wet cappuccino. Iced latte In the United States, an iced latte is usually espresso and chilled milk poured over ice. Unlike a hot latte, it does not usually contain steamed milk or foam. Iced lattes often have sugar or flavoring syrups added, though purists prefer them to consist simply of coffee and milk; they are always served blended with ice. The espresso can be pre-chilled (sometimes as a mixture of espresso and milk) or frozen in advance to avoid warming up the drink. Caff√® latte vs. latte macchiato A glass of latte macchiato A caff√® latte differs from a latte macchiato. In a latte macchiato, espresso is added to milk, rather than the reverse, and caff√® lattes have a stronger coffee flavour. The latte macchiato is milk steamed to microfoam, served in a glass with a half shot of espresso poured gently through the foamy top layer, creating a layered drink with a \\"macchia\\" (literally: \\"a stain\\")‚Äîa spot‚Äîof espresso on the top. As with a caff√® macchiato, which is espresso with a spot of milk atop, indicating there is a hint of milk underneath the espresso foam, a latte macchiato is the opposite, to indicate there is espresso in the milk. The use of the term 'macchiato' has been widened to include a huge array of beverages and ice creams. In some countries (such as Germany), latte macchiato is the preferred term. The word \\"macchiato\\" itself is Italian for \\"stained\\" which refers to creating a coffee or milk \\"stain\\" in the drink. Although the term macchiato has been used to describe various types of espresso drinks, a caff√® macchiato is 3/4 espresso and 1/4 steamed milk. A caff√® macchiato is about and is usually served in a demitasse. Although a traditional macchiato is small, there are still ways to pour art into the crema of drink. The only difference between pouring latte art and macchiato art is that for a macchiato, the milk has to be poured faster and through a much smaller stream. Serving styles A cup of latte made with matcha, called green tea latte, is a popular variation of latte found in East Asian countries. *In some establishments, lattes are served in a glass on a saucer with a napkin to hold the (sometimes hot) glass. *A latte is sometimes served in a bowl; in Europe, particularly Scandinavia, this is referred to as a caf√© au lait. *Increasingly common in the United States and Europe, latte art has led to the stylization of coffee making, and the creation of which is now a popular art form. Created by pouring steaming, and mostly frothed, milk into the coffee, that liquid is introduced into the beverage in such a way that patterns are distinguishable on the top of coffee. Popular patterns can include hearts, flowers, trees and other forms of simplistic representations of images and objects. *Iced latte is often served unstirred so that coffee appears to \\"float\\" on top of white milk in a glass cup. *A variation of the iced latte, known as the \\"bootleg latte\\", \\"ghetto latte\\", or \\"poor man's latte\\",Charles Leroux. 2006. The bootleg latte: Would you make one? October 5. Chicago Tribune. is an iced espresso ordered in a larger than normal cup filled up with free milk from the condiment station. The drink has spawned debate at coffee shops where an iced espresso is considerably cheaper than an iced latte. *In South Asia, East Asia and North America, local variants of teas have been combined with steamed or frothed milk to create \\"tea latte\\".

Soy milk latte with latte art Politics Calling people \\"latte drinkers\\" pejoratively has become a common political attack in some Western cultures. The popularity of espresso drinking in large cities, especially among more affluent urban populations, has caused some to consider it elitist behavior. In the United States, conservative political commentators have been known to call their opponents \\"latte-drinking liberal elites.\\".., In Canadian politics, latte drinking is used to portray people as out-of-touch intellectuals and the antithesis of the Tim Hortons coffee drinker that is considered representative of an ordinary Canadian... In Scandinavian politics, the term \\"the caff√® latte segment\\" is used to describe elitist voters. According to a 2018 study, 16% of liberals in the United States prefer lattes, whereas 9% of conservatives and 11% of moderates do. The overwhelming majority of people, whether they are liberal, conservative or moderate, express a preference for regular brewed coffee.

In the 1960s and 1970s, he was vocalist of Free and Bad Company. After stints in two lesser-known bands in the 1980s and early 1990s, The Firm and The Law, he became a solo artist. He has more recently toured and recorded with Queen. A poll in Rolling Stone magazine ranked him number 55 on its list of the \\"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\\". In 2011 Rodgers received the British Academy's Ivor Novello Award for Outstanding Contribution to British Music. Rodgers has been cited as a significant influence on a number of notable rock singers. In 1991, John Mellencamp called Rodgers \\"the best rock singer ever\\". Freddie Mercury in particular liked Rodgers and his aggressive style. Early career Paul Bernard Rodgers was born in Middlesbrough, England. He played bass for a band named The Roadrunners. Colin Bradley originally had the lead vocal slot, but convinced Rodgers to sing and front the band as he was primarily interested in playing rhythm guitar and his oldest brother Joe (who managed the band) supported the idea. Just before leaving Middlesbrough for the London music scene, the band changed its name to The Wildflowers. Other members of this band were Micky Moody (later of Whitesnake) and Bruce Thomas (later of Elvis Costello and The Attractions). Free Rodgers joined in 1968 as singer/songwriter for bluesy rockers Free. In 1970, they shot up the international radio charts with \\"All Right Now\\", which Rodgers wrote with the group's bassist Andy Fraser. It was a number one hit in more than 20 territories and acknowledged by ASCAP in 1990 for having received over a million radio plays in the US. For a short time, Free were alongside Led Zeppelin as among the highest grossing British acts, though Free's status was not sustained. Free released four albums with a combination of blues, ballads and rock that were Top Five successes in the UK. When in 2000, the song \\"All Right Now\\" achieved the mark of two million radio plays in the UK, an award was given to Rodgers as one of the two writers. After the first break-up of Free in the spring of 1971, Rodgers briefly formed a three-piece band called Peace. Alongside bassist Stewart McDonald and drummer Mick Underwood, Rodgers played guitar and sang lead vocals. Peace supported Mott the Hoople's UK tour in 1971, but broke up when Free reformed at the start of 1972. Two songs by Peace were eventually included on the fifth disc of the 2000 Free compilation Songs of Yesterday, along with a song that Rodgers recorded with the Maytals. A bootleg has circulated of a 22 December 1971 appearance by Peace on the BBC's Top Gear program. 1970s: Bad Company Rodgers formed his next band, Bad Company, with Mick Ralphs, former guitarist of Mott the Hoople. The lineup also included Rodgers' bandmate from Free, drummer Simon Kirke, and Boz Burrell, former vocalist and bassist of King Crimson. Rodgers said he and Ralphs were still trying to come up with a name for the band, \\"and I just said 'Bad Company', and there was this scuffling noise and he said, 'Shit, I dropped the phone‚Äîthat's it! Bad Company was the first act signed to Led Zeppelin's new record label, Swan Song. They toured from 1973 to 1982, and had several hits such as \\"Feel Like Makin' Love\\", \\"Can't Get Enough\\", \\"Shooting Star\\", \\"Bad Company\\", and \\"Run with the Pack\\". Rodgers played instruments on several tracks: \\"Bad Company\\" and \\"Run With The Pack\\" featured him on piano; \\"Rock and Roll Fantasy\\" on guitar; and on the ballad \\"Seagull\\" Rodgers played all of the instruments. Bad Company earned six platinum albums until Rodgers left in 1982, stating that he wanted to spend time with his young family. It was revealed in April 2011 that after Jim Morrison's death in 1971, the rest of The Doors wanted Rodgers to replace him. Robbie Krieger flew to England to personally offer him the job. However, Rodgers has said that he was off the grid in a very rural area at the time, and the moment passed. In late 1973, Rodgers was asked to become the singer of Deep Purple when Ian Gillan had left the band. He rejected their offer in order to start Bad Company. 1980s: Solo career and The Firm In October 1983, Rodgers released his first solo LP Cut Loose. He composed all of the music and played all of the instruments. The album reached number 135 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart. When his friend Jimmy Page started to come around to his house, guitar in hand and Led Zeppelin at an end, the duo's first live pairing was on the US ARMS (Action Research into Multiple Sclerosis) Tour, which had first been mooted by Eric Clapton and, besides Rodgers and Page, would include Jeff Beck, Joe Cocker, Steve Winwood and others. The inspiration behind ARMS had been former Small Faces/Faces member Ronnie Lane's own struggle with M.S. This led to Rodgers and Page's further teaming in the group The Firm, which resulted in two albums and two tours. Despite being panned by critics, The Firm's two albums, The Firm and Mean Business, achieved moderate sales success and produced the radio hits \\"Radioactive\\", \\"Satisfaction Guaranteed\\", and, in the UK, \\"All The King's Horses\\". During this same period, a series of albums were produced called Willie and the Poor Boys. Rodgers and Page were briefly part of this and recorded \\"These Arms of Mine\\", an Otis Redding tune. This recording also became a video promoting the CD. 1990s: The Law and solo career The Law, Rodgers' 1991 musical venture with former The Who and Faces drummer Kenney Jones, produced Billboard's number one AOR chart hit \\"Laying Down the Law\\" written by Rodgers, but the album peaked at number 126 on the Billboard 200 chart. A second album can be found on the bootleg market, which is often referred to as The Law II. It is believed that this collection of songs were leftovers from the first album. Rodgers acknowledged the influence of Jimi Hendrix by collaborating with Steve Vai, Hendrix's Band of Gypsys (Buddy Miles and Billy Cox) and the London Metropolitan Orchestra and recorded the track \\"Bold As Love\\", on the Hendrix tribute album In From The Storm. Then Rodgers teamed with Journey guitarist Neal Schon and released The Hendrix Set, a live 5-track CD, recorded in 1993 with Rodgers' interpretations of Hendrix songs. A Canadian and US tour followed. His Grammy-nominated solo CD, Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters was released in 1993. Rodgers wrote the title track and was backed by guitarists Brian May, Gary Moore, David Gilmour, Jeff Beck, Steve Miller, Buddy Guy, Richie Sambora, Brian Setzer, Slash, Neal Schon and Trevor Rabin. For Woodstock's 25th anniversary in 1994, Rodgers pulled together drummer Jason Bonham, bassist Andy Fraser (from Free), guitarists Slash and Schon at the last moment to perform as the Paul Rodgers Rock and Blues Revue. In 1995 he formed a new band consisting of Jaz Lochrie on bass, Jimmy Copley on drums and Geoff Whitehorn on guitar. The band (The Paul Rodgers Band) toured extensively in Europe, US and in the UK until 1998 and released three albums ‚Äì Now, Now and Live and Electric. Now charted internationally in the Top 40.

McMahon and Johnny Carson began their association in their first TV series, the ABC game show Who Do You Trust?, running from 1957 to 1962. McMahon then made his famous thirty-year mark as Carson's sidekick, announcer and second banana on NBC's The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson from 1962 to 1992. He also hosted the original Star Search from 1983 to 1995, co-hosted TV's Bloopers & Practical Jokes with Dick Clark from 1982 to 1998 and also presented sweepstakes for the direct marketing company American Family Publishers (not, as is commonly believed, its main rival Publishers Clearing House)., Publishers Clearing House official blog, by Dave Sayer, March 15, 2009.

Prior to the US entry into World War II, both the Army and Navy required pilot candidates to attend at least two years of college. McMahon studied at Boston College from 1940 to 1941. On The Howard Stern Show in 2001, he stated that after Pearl Harbor was attacked, the college requirement remained in effect and he still had to finish his two years of college before applying for Marine Corps flight training. After completing the college requirement, McMahon began his primary flight training in Dallas. This was followed by fighter training in Pensacola, where he also earned his carrier landing qualifications. He was a Marine Corps flight instructor in F4U Corsairs for two years, finally being ordered to the Pacific fleet in 1945. However, his orders were canceled after the atomic bomb attacks on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, forcing Japan's unconditional surrender. As an officer in the reserves, McMahon was recalled to active duty during the Korean War. He flew an OE-1 (the original Marine designation for the unarmed single-engine Cessna O-1 Bird Dog) spotter plane, serving as an artillery spotter for Marine batteries and a forward controller for Navy and Marine fighter bombers. He flew a total of 85 combat missions, earning six Air Medals. After the war, he stayed with the Marines as a reserve officer, retiring in 1966 as a colonel.

He describes what happened when the pair first met, the whole meeting being \\"about as exciting as watching a traffic light change\\".Ed McMahon Obituary. For almost 30 years, McMahon introduced the show with a drawn-out \\"Heeere's Johnny!\\" His booming voice and constant laughter alongside the \\"King of Late Night\\" earned McMahon the nickname the \\"Human Laugh Track\\" and \\"Toymaker to the King\\". As part of the introductory patter to The Tonight Show, McMahon would state his name out loud, pronouncing it as , but neither long-time cohort Carson nor anyone else who interviewed him ever seemed to pick up on that subtlety, usually pronouncing his name . Aside from his co-hosting duties, it also fell upon McMahon during the early years of Carson's tenure (when the show ran 105 minutes) to host the first fifteen minutes of Tonight, which did not air nationally. McMahon also served as guest host on at least one occasion, substituting for Carson during a week of programs that aired between July 29 and August 2, 1963, and again for two nights in October 1963. McMahon served as a counter to the notoriously shy Carson. Nonetheless, McMahon once told an interviewer that after his many decades as an emcee, he would still get \\"butterflies\\" in his stomach every time he would walk onto a stage and would use that nervousness as a source of energy. His famous opening line, \\"Heeere's Johnny!\\", was used in the 1980 horror film The Shining by the character Jack Torrance (played by Jack Nicholson) as he goes after his wife and child with an axe. He did in-program commercials for many sponsors of The Tonight Show, most notably Budweiser beer and Alpo dog food, and also did commercials for them that ran on other programs. =Star Search= McMahon was also host of the successful weekly syndicated series Star Search, which began in 1983 and helped launch the careers of numerous actors, singers, choreographers and comedians.

McMahon and Dick Clark hosted the television series (and later special broadcasts of) TV's Bloopers and Practical Jokes on NBC from 1982 to 1993. In 1967, McMahon had a role in the film The Incident and appeared as Santa Claus on The Mitzi Gaynor Christmas Show. From 1965 to 1969, McMahon served as \\"communicator\\" (host) of the Saturday afternoon segment of Monitor, the weekend news, features and entertainment magazine on the NBC Radio Network. The 1955 movie Dementia, which has music without dialogue, was released as Daughter of Horror in 1970. The newer version, which had a voice over by McMahon, still has music without dialogue, but with an added narration read by him. McMahon had a supporting role in the original Fun with Dick and Jane in 1977. He then played himself in \\"Remote Control Man\\", a season one episode of Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories. In 2004, McMahon became the announcer and co-host of Alf's Hit Talk Show on TV Land.

Additionally, he also appeared in the feature documentary film, Pitch People, the first motion picture to take an in-depth look at the history and evolution of pitching products to the public. In the early 2000s, McMahon made a series of Neighborhood Watch public service announcements parodying the surprise appearances to contest winners that he was supposedly known for. (In fact, it is not clear whether the company McMahon fronted, American Family Publishers, regularly performed such unannounced visits, as opposed to Publishers Clearing House and its oft-promoted \\"prize patrol\\".) Towards the end of the decade, McMahon took on other endorsement roles, playing a rapper for a FreeCreditReport.com commercial and in a Cash4Gold commercial alongside MC Hammer. McMahon was also the spokesman for Pride Mobility, a leading power wheelchair and scooter manufacturer. His final film appearance was in the independent John Hughes themed rom-com Jelly as Mr. Closure alongside actress Natasha Lyonne. Mostly in the 1980s through the 1990s, McMahon was the spokesperson for Colonial Penn Life Insurance Company. Personal life =Marriage and children= McMahon married Alyce Ferrell on July 5, 1945, while he was serving as a flight instructor in the Marines.

McMahon was also sued by Citibank for $180,000. McMahon appeared on Larry King Live on June 5, 2008, with his wife to talk about this situation. In the interview, McMahon's wife Pam said that people assumed that the McMahons had a lot of money because of his celebrity status. Pamela McMahon also commented that they do not have \\"millions\\" of dollars.Ed McMahon explains his mortgage mess, CNN.com, June 6, 2008. On July 30, 2008, McMahon's financial status suffered another blow. McMahon failed to pay divorce attorney Norman Solovay $275,168, according to a lawsuit filed in the Manhattan federal court. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, had hired Solovay to represent Linda Schmerge, his daughter from another relationship, in a \\"matrimonial matter\\", said Solovay's lawyer, Michael Shanker. On August 14, 2008, real estate mogul Donald Trump announced that he would purchase McMahon's home from Countrywide Financial and lease it to McMahon, so the home would not be foreclosed. McMahon agreed instead to a deal with a private buyer for his hilltop home, said Howard Bragman, McMahon's former spokesman. Bragman declined to name the buyer or the selling price, but he said it was not Trump. In early September, after the second buyer's offer fell through, Trump renewed his offer to purchase the home. =Health problems= On April 20, 2002, McMahon sued his insurance company for more than $20 million, alleging that he was sickened by toxic mold that spread through his Beverly Hills house after contractors failed to properly clean up water damage from a broken pipe. McMahon and his wife, Pamela, became ill from the mold, as did members of their household staff, according to the Los Angeles County Superior Court suit. The McMahons blamed the mold for the death of the family dog, Muffin. Their suit, one of many in recent years over toxic mold, was filed against American Equity Insurance Co., a pair of insurance adjusters, and several environmental cleanup contractors. It sought monetary damages for alleged breach of contract, negligence, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. On March 21, 2003, the long legal battle ended with McMahon being awarded $7.2 million from several companies who were negligent for allowing toxic mold into his home, sickening him and his wife and killing their dog. McMahon was injured in 2007 in a fall and, in March 2008, it was announced he was recovering from a broken neck and two subsequent surgeries. He later sued Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and two doctors claiming fraud, battery, elder abuse, and emotional distress, and accused them of discharging him with a broken neck after his fall and botching two later neck surgeries. On February 27, 2009, it was reported that McMahon had been in an undisclosed Los Angeles hospital (later confirmed as Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center) for almost a month. He was listed in serious condition and was in the intensive care unit. His publicist told reporters that he was admitted for pneumonia at the time, but could not confirm nor deny reports that McMahon had been diagnosed with bone cancer.Ed McMahon ill with pneumonia, uk.reuters.com; accessed January 16, 2015. =Death= McMahon died on June 23, 2009, shortly after midnight at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles, California.

He obtained market, coinage and toll rights for the city of Bremen in 888 from Emperor Arnulf of Carinthia and thus considerably improved the financial state of the archbishopric. In 884 he personally led a Frisian army against the Vikings and, after the victorious Battle of Norditi was able to drive them permanently out of East Frisia. Rimbert is revered as a saint particularly in Frisia. His feast day is 4 February. After Ansgar, epithetised the Apostle of the North, Rimbert is revered as the Second Apostle of the North, besides the missionary Sigfrid of Sweden.

They disbanded in 1973; lead singer Paul Rodgers went on to become the frontman of the band Bad Company, which also featured his Free bandmate Simon Kirke on drums. Lead guitarist Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler in 1975, but died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 25 in 1976. Bassist Andy Fraser formed Sharks. Free became renowned for their live shows and non-stop touring. However, their studio albums did not sell very well until their third, Fire and Water, featured the massive hit \\"All Right Now\\". The song helped secure them a place at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, where they played to 600,000 people. In the early 1970s Free became one of the biggest-selling British blues rock groups; by the time they disbanded, they had sold more than 20 million albums around the world and had played more than 700 arena and festival concerts. \\"All Right Now\\" remains a rock staple, and has been entered in ASCAP's \\"One Million\\" airplay singles club. Rolling Stone has referred to the band as \\"British hard rock pioneers\\". The magazine ranked Rodgers No. 55 in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Singers of All Time\\", while Kossoff was ranked No. 51 in its list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\". Free were signed to Island Records in the UK and A&M; Records in North America. Free with Steve Winwood, Amsterdam, July 1970)  History  = Formation, early years and breakthrough = Most remarkable about the birth of Free was the youth of the band members who came together to rehearse and play their first gig on the evening of 19 April 1968 at the Nag's Head pub, which was at the junction of York Road and Plough Road in Battersea, London. Bass player Andy Fraser was 15 years old, lead guitarist Paul Kossoff was 17, and both lead singer Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke were 18. By November of that year, having been given the name Free by Alexis Korner, they had recorded their first album, titled Tons of Sobs, for Island Records and, although it was not released until the following year, the album documents their first six months together and contains studio renditions of much of their early live set. To promote their forthcoming debut album they also opened some gigs at the end of 1968 for The Who, who played a short theatre tour with Arthur Brown. Paul Kossoff and Simon Kirke first became friends in the R&B; band Black Cat Bones, but they wanted to move on. Paul Kossoff saw vocalist Paul Rodgers singing with the band Brown Sugar while visiting the Fickle Pickle, an R&B; club in London's Finsbury Park. He was immediately impressed and asked if he could jam with Rodgers onstage. Along with Kirke, they began the search for a fourth member. Alexis Korner recommended Andy Fraser to the band; at the age of 15, Fraser had already been playing with John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers. Korner also provided the name \\"Free\\" to the newly formed band. Unlike their previous albums, Tons of Sobs and Free, their album Fire and Water, released in 1970, was a huge success largely due to its hit single \\"All Right Now\\", which reached No. 1 on the UK rock music charts, No. 2 on the UK singles chart and No. 4 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart. The album reached No. 2 in the UK charts and No. 17 on the U.S charts, making it the most successful Free album. \\"All Right Now\\" became a No. 1 hit in over 20 territories and was recognised by ASCAP in 1990 for garnering 1,000,000 plus radio plays in the US by late 1989. In 2000 an award was given to Paul Rodgers by the British Music Industry when \\"All Right Now\\" passed 2,000,000 radio plays in the UK. Highway was their fourth studio album, recorded extremely quickly in September 1970. Highway performed poorly in the charts, reaching No. 41 in the UK and No. 190 in the US. = First break-up, reformation, and final break-up = The band disbanded in 1971 because of differences between Fraser and Rodgers, who felt he was not being listened to. This led to the release of the live album called Free Live!. In early 1972 the band set aside their differences and reformed in an effort to save Kossoff from his growing drug addiction, and released Free at Last in June of the same year. Fraser left the band in mid-1972, frustrated by Kossoff's unreliability at being able to perform at shows or even at showing up. The remaining members recruited Japanese bass player Tetsu Yamauchi and keyboardist John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick, who had worked with Kossoff and Kirke during Free's initial split, recording Kossoff, Kirke, Tetsu and Rabbit and recorded what would be Free's final album, Heartbreaker. Kossoff was replaced by ex-Osibisa guitarist Wendell Richardson for a USA tour in 1973, but shortly thereafter Free disbanded for good. Rodgers and Kirke went on to form Bad Company, Fraser formed Sharks and later the Andy Fraser Band, and Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler. = After Free = With Kossoff in better health again in late 1975, he was delighted that ex-colleagues Rodgers and Kirke asked him to join them on stage for two nights. A British tour was set to begin on 25 April 1976 with Back Street Crawler headlining with Bad Company in support of Back Street Crawler's second album, but again Kossoff's drug addictions contributed to a drastic decline in the guitarist's health. On a flight from Los Angeles to New York City on 19 March 1976, Paul Kossoff died from a pulmonary embolism at the age of 25. After parting with Bad Company in 1982, Rodgers went on to explore the heavy blues stylings of Free again in his solo career during the 1980s and 1990s, and in the bands The Firm and The Law. Subsequently he teamed up as vocalist with two of the three remaining members of Queen (Brian May and Roger Taylor). In September 2008, Queen + Paul Rodgers released their first studio album The Cosmos Rocks. Rodgers also performed Free and Bad Company songs whilst on tour with Queen, in addition to the traditional Queen songs and new cuts from their most recently released album. Rodgers and Kirke toured again with Bad Company from 2012 to 2016. Andy Fraser died on 16 March 2015. In 2017, Paul Rodgers embarked on a Free Spirit UK Tour in May 2017 to celebrate the music of Free by performing songs strictly from the Free catalogue. In 2019 Bad Company reformed to tour in support of the first leg on Lynyrd Skynyrd‚Äôs Last Of The Street Survivors Tour.

Originally a vocalist and guitarist, Burrell is best known for his bass playing and work with King Crimson and Bad Company. He died of a heart attack in Spain on 21 September 2006, aged 60. Career =Early years= Raymond Burrell was born on 1 August 1946 in Holbeach, Lincolnshire. As a teen in the 1950s, he began playing rhythm guitar for the Tea Time 4, a group formed with his school pal Bernie Rudd. They both acquired a passion for jazz and enjoyed acts such as Mose Allison, John Coltrane, and Charlie Mingus. The group had several personnel changes and moved to London in 1965 at the suggestion of manager, Jack Barrie. With the addition of Ian McLagan on keyboard and a name change to Boz People, the group secured a contract with EMI's Columbia label. Burrell's style leaned more towards jazz, whereas McLagan was into Booker T, four singles being recorded and backing band slots with Kenny Lynch and Elkie Brooks. However, with little commercial success McLagan soon left to join The Small Faces. Burrell next enjoyed a short stint in the soul band, Feel For Soul, back in Norwich from 1966 until the following year. In late 1965, Burrell was briefly considered to replace Roger Daltrey in The Who. In 1968 Burrell recorded a cover of Bob Dylan's \\"Down in the Flood\\" released as a single simply as 'Boz'. He was joined by organist Jon Lord, guitarist Ritchie Blackmore and drummer Ian Paice, who formed Deep Purple at the same time, and bassist Chas Hodges, later of Chas and Dave fame. Burrell later appeared on Centipede's 1971 recording Septober Energy. =King Crimson= In 1971 Burrell joined King Crimson as the new vocalist, having met Robert Fripp while both were performing with Centipede. After a last minute let down from new bassist Rick Kemp, Boz (who had only limited guitar-playing ability) was installed as the band's bass player with Fripp and Ian Wallace teaching him to play rather than start the search again. The band toured and recorded the band's fourth studio album, Islands (1971), a warmer sounding release and the band's only string ensemble experimentation. Tensions began socially on tour and creatively with the direction of the group's latest effort. This led to lyricist Peter Sinfield being ousted following the band's next tour. During rehearsals in early 1972 the band fell apart with all members leaving due to creative restrictions imposed by Fripp as a \\"quality control\\" measure. The band members were convinced to rejoin and fulfil their touring commitments for that year with the intention of disbanding thereafter. Recordings from this subsequent tour exist as the live compilation, Earthbound (1972), and as a large part of the box set Sailors' Tales (1970‚Äì1972) (2017), which contains studio and live recordings spanning Burrell's entire tenure in the band. Although relations improved between both parties leading to an offer from the musicians to continue on in the band, Fripp had already moved on and declined to participate. In 1973 Burrell, Wallace and Mel Collins reunited with Sinfield for his solo effort, Still. They also went on to form Snape with Collective Consciousness Society's Alexis Korner and Peter Thorup, who had been on tour with King Crimson in the states the previous year, releasing the studio album, Accidentally Born in New Orleans, and a live album, Live on Tour in Germany. In 1974 Burrell featured with Chapman Whitney Streetwalkers along with other members of Family and King Crimson. =Bad Company= Burrell was a founding member of the supergroup Bad Company, formed in 1973 along with ex- Mott the Hoople guitarist Mick Ralphs and two former members of Free: vocalist Paul Rodgers and drummer Simon Kirke. The band debuted with the self-titled Bad Company in 1974 which eventually went Platinum, as did the 1975 follow-up, Straight Shooter and 1976's Run with the Pack. 1977's Burnin' Sky proved less successful, but the group's fifth release in 1979, Desolation Angels, saw the band once again return to platinum status. Rough Diamonds, the final studio album featuring the original members, released in 1982, was the worst-selling album in this incarnation and the band soon after split. Using the name Bad Company, Ralphs and Kirke continued to play together, but it was not until 1998 that Burrell rejoined his bandmates along with Rodgers for a reunion tour, recording four new songs and releasing the compilation The 'Original' Bad Co. Anthology. Burrell left the band in 1999 along with Ralphs. =Later work= In January 1981, Burrell joined Roger Chapman again for his solo band, The Shortlist, leaving in 1983. He returned in May 1987 but left again the following year in June. In 1982 Burrell contributed to Jon Lord's solo album, Before I Forget, on the track \\"Hollywood Rock and Roll\\" and in 1984 he joined the short lived Nightfly. In the 1990s Burrell worked with such acts as Alvin Lee for his Best of British Blues tour of 1996 and Ruby Turner. During this period his main creative outlet was with the Scottish blues singer Tam White. Their collaboration developed into a trio known as The Shoe String Band and a big band the Celtic Groove Connection. White was present at Burrell's apartment in Spain when Burrell suddenly died of a heart attack during rehearsals, on 21 September 2006.

The practice is popular in Cantonese-speaking regions, including Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also carried out in other regions worldwide where there are overseas Chinese communities. Yum cha generally involves small portions of steamed, pan-fried, and deep-fried dim sum dishes served in bamboo steamers, which are designed to be eaten communally and washed down with hot tea. People often go to yum cha in large groups for family gatherings and celebrations.  Description  Lin Heung Teahouse serves traditional dim sum in Central, Hong Kong Yum cha (; lit. \\"drink tea\\"), also known as going for dim sum (Cantonese: È£üÈªûÂøÉ), is the Cantonese tradition of brunch involving Chinese tea and dim sum. The practice is popular in Cantonese-speaking regions such as Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, and Macau. It is also carried out in other regions worldwide where there are overseas Chinese communities, like Vietnam, Australia and the United States. Yum cha generally involves small portions of steamed, pan-fried, and deep-fried dim sum dishes served in bamboo steamers, which are designed to be eaten communally and washed down with hot tea. Traditionally, the elderly gather to eat dim sum after morning exercises. Many have yum cha with family during weekends and holiday gatherings. Overhead view of yum cha at Dim Sum City in Hong Kong  Etymology  Yum cha in the Cantonese language, both literary and vernacular, literally means \\"drink tea\\". \\"È£≤\\" means \\"to drink\\", and \\"Ëå∂\\" means \\"tea\\". In Cantonese, yum cha refers to having a meal with dim sum dishes. Dim sum is the English word based on a Cantonese pronunciation of ÈªûÂøÉ. In colloquial Mandarin dialects and Standard Vernacular Chinese based on one form of colloquial Mandarin, this character () is often used to mean È£≤ for the verb \\"drink\\". In the Chinese language, ÈªûÂøÉ refers to a variety of foods, including European-style cakes and pastries, and has no equivalent in English. In the English language, dim sum refers to the small-dish appetizers and desserts. In Australia, the term \\"yum cha\\" is specifically used to describe Cantonese restaurants serving dim sum from pushable carts, rather than √† la carte. alt= Service An introductory video on yum cha and dim sum Traditionally, yum cha is practiced in the morning or early afternoon, hence the terms chow cha (, \\"morning tea\\") or ha ng cha (, \\"afternoon tea\\") when appropriate. The former is also known as yum zou cha (), which literally means \\"drinking morning tea\\". Some restaurants now offer dim sum during dinner hours and even late at night, though most venues still generally reserve the serving of dim sum for breakfast and lunch periods. The combination of morning tea, afternoon tea, evening tea, lunch and dinner is known as sam cha leung fan (, \\"three tea, two meal\\"). The history of the tradition can be traced back to the period of Xianfeng Emperor, who first referred to establishments serving tea as yi li guan (, \\"1 cent house\\"). These offered a place for people to gossip, which became known as cha waa (, \\"tea talk\\"). These tea houses grew to become their own type of restaurant and the visits became known as yum cha. alt= The traditional methods of serving dim sum include using trays strung around servers' necks or using push carts. The teoi ce (, \\"push-cart\\") method of serving dim sum, dates back to the early 1960s and includes dim sum items cooked in advance, placed into steamer baskets, and brought out on push carts into the dining area. Employees call out the items they are serving, customers notify the server about the items they would like to order, and the server places the desired items on the table. The general yum cha atmosphere is a loud, festive one due to the servers calling out the dishes and the groups of diners having conversations. Many dim sum restaurants now use a paper-based √† la carte ordering system. This method provides fresh, cooked-to-order dim sum while managing the real estate and resource constraints involved with push cart service. Tea cup, tea pot, and bill card. The cost of a meal was traditionally calculated by the number, size and type of dishes left on the patron's table at the end. In modern yum cha restaurants, servers mark orders by stamping a card or marking a bill card on the table. Servers in some restaurants use distinctive stamps to track sales statistics for each server. Customs and etiquette alt= The customs associated with the tea served at yum cha include: * Selecting the type of tea to be served immediately after being seated by the server. * Pouring tea for others before filling one's own tea cup as a sign of politeness. * Filling tea cups to about 80% because of the Chinese proverb „Äå„Äç, which is translated literally as \\"it is fraud for the guest if the tea cup is full, but it is a sign of respect when it is alcohol.\\" * Tapping the table with two (occasionally one) fingers of the same hand in a gesture known is as 'finger kowtow' that is a gesture of gratitude after receiving tea. This gesture can be traced to the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty, who used to travel incognito. While visiting the Jiangnan region, he once went into a teahouse with his companions. In order to maintain his anonymity, he took his turn at pouring tea. His companions wanted to kowtow, but to do so would have revealed the identity of the emperor. Finally, one of them tapped three fingers on the table (one finger representing their bowed head and the other two representing their prostrate arms). * Flipping open the lid (of hinged metal tea pots) or offset the tea pot cover (on ceramic tea pots) to signal an empty tea pot. Servers will then refill the pot. * Following a traditional practice of washing the utensils with the first round of tea. A basin is available for disposing of the rinse tea. The taste of the first round of tea is considered not the finest yet, and will be richer afterwards.China Times(15 December 2014). \\"È¶ôÊ∏Ø„ÄåÈ£≤Ëå∂Á¶ÆÂÑÄ„Äç ÂÖàÁÜ±Ëå∂ÂÖàÊ¥óÁ¢óÊ¥óÁ≠∑Â≠ê\\" [Video file]. Retrieved from https://tube.chinatimes.com/20141215004427-261402 For the diners, some typical customs include: * Selecting the tables closest to the kitchen because the dim sum carts exit from there and the diners closest to the kitchen have first choice of the fresh dishes. * Ordering desert dishes on the dim sum carts at any time since there is not a set sequence for the meal. * Feeling comfortable with declining dishes being offered by servers pushing the dim sum carts, regardless of the reasons (dietary, food preference, budgetary, or other reasons). Lazy susan at yum cha lunch in Hong Kong with dim sum and lunch dishes While eating, some of the manners include: * Spinning the lazy susan such that the oldest person at the table has the opportunity to have the first serving when the meal starts or when an additional dish is served, as a show of respect. The lazy susan should not be spun when someone is taking food from a dish. * Refraining from standing chopsticks straight up vertically, such as in rice or buns, due to the resemblance of incense offerings for the deceased. * Offering dining companions the final serving when there is one last piece or final serving remaining on a dish. * Insisting on paying the bill as it is common to treat one another to meals . Lin Heung Teahouse  Status and future  Yum cha continues in both traditional and modern forms, including restaurants serving both traditional and modern fusion dim sum. Modern dim sum can include dishes like abalone siu mai and barbecued wagyu beef bun. Dim sum chefs for yum cha continue to be trained at leading culinary institutes. One restaurant in Hong Kong creates social media-friendly dishes by preparing dumplings and buns shaped to resemble animals. Whether traditional or modern-day, yum cha is to be shared with friends and loved ones.

Career Ralphs began his career as a teenager, playing with blues-rock band the Buddies. He released a single with that group in 1964 before joining the Mod Doc Thomas Group in 1966. After an eponymous Italian album debut, the band changed its name twice, first to Silence in 1968 and then, in 1969, to Mott the Hoople. Ralphs remained with Mott until 1973. In 1973, he founded Bad Company along with vocalist Paul Rodgers from Free. The band's debut album in 1974 included the Ralphs'-penned hit \\"Can't Get Enough\\", for which Ralphs tuned his guitar in the open-C tuning C-G-C-G-C-E, stating, \\"It never really sounds right in standard tuning. It needs the open C to have that ring.\\" The debut album reached number one in the United States. Ralphs continued to record and tour with Bad Company until the original band folded in 1982. In 1984 he toured with Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour on Gilmour's About Face tour, although he did not play on the album. In 1985, he released a solo album, Take This, which included Free's and Bad Company's drummer Simon Kirke.rockdetector.com He teamed up with future Bad Company guitarist Dave Colwell for a limited four-run live support of the album, which also featured drummer Chris Slade of Manfred Mann's Earth Band and keyboard player Lindsay Bridgewater, who performed with Ozzy Osbourne. He did one performance with a band called Cold Turkey. Bad Company reformed with different line-ups between 1986 and 1998. But after a reunion tour with the original foursome in 1999, Ralphs announced that he was giving up touring, something he was never comfortable with in either band, since he has an extreme fear of flying. Ralphs second solo album It's All Good, an instrumental, came out in 2001. Two years later his That's Life ‚Äì Can't Get Enough album was released, including a demo version of \\"Can't Get Enough\\". In 2004, he once again teamed up with former Mott colleague Ian Hunter, playing second lead guitar (along with Andy York) on Hunter's UK tour. Ralphs performed at Hunter's 2005 concert at the London Astoria, with Ralphs performing a guitar solo to \\"All the Way from Memphis\\". Ralphs performing with Mott the Hoople at a reunion gig, Hammersmith Apollo, October 2009 On 2 July 2008, it was announced that the original line-up of Bad Company (minus Boz Burrell who died in September 2006) would do a one-off gig at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Hollywood, Florida on 8 August 2008. According to Paul Rodgers, they did this gig to 'protect the legacy they have built and cement the rights to the trademark Bad Company for touring'. Mott the Hoople, including Ralphs, reunited for two shows at the Blake Theatre in Monmouth close to Rockfield Studios where they rehearsed before playing five concerts at the Hammersmith Apollo in London, during September and October 2009. All five of the original members participated in the reunion with Martin Chambers assisting on drums. In 2011, Ralphs formed The Mick Ralphs Blues Band with musicians he met while guesting at a jam session at the Nag's Head pub in High Wycombe: Stuart Son Maxwell, harmonica/vocals; Jim Maving, guitar; Sam Kelly, drums; Dickey Baldwin, bass. The band's website stated that Ralphs is seeking to explore his blues and soul roots, playing covers of classic blues and R&B; songs. The band made its debut as Mick Ralphs and Co at Jagz Club in Ascot, Berkshire in June 2011, changing the name to the Mick Ralphs Blues Band soon afterwards. More dates were announced for late 2011 and early 2012. In 2012, Bad Company performed a short run of European festival dates. In 2013 and 2014, Bad Company and Lynyrd Skynyrd jointly toured throughout the United States and Canada, initially commemorating the 40th anniversary of Skynyrd's first album release and Bad Company's formation. In 2016, Bad Company announced a US tour with Joe Walsh. Mick Ralphs initially announced that he would not be participating in this tour and that Rich Robinson of the Black Crowes would be standing in for him. In June 2016, the group announced a U.K. arena tour with special guests Richie Sambora and Orianthi culminating in a show at London's O2 Arena on 29 October. Mick Ralphs rejoined the band for the duration of the tour. Following the band's concluding performance in London, it was reported that Ralphs had been hospitalized, having suffered a stroke.

He was the commander of the Braunschweiger J√§ger, a regiment of soldiers from the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel that was among the German units hired by the British during the American War of Independence. He then commanded all German soldiers in the Saratoga Campaign.  Biography  = Early career = Friedrich Adolf was born in Lauterbach, Hesse, into the Riedesel family of Hessian Uradel barons, the second son of Johann Wilhelm Riedesel, Freiherr zu Eisenbach (1705-1782) and Sophia von Borcke (1705-1769). His birth on June 3, 1738 and early education both took place in Lauterbach. The title of \\"Freiherr\\" (Baron) was carried by all men of his lineage who reached majority. His parents disagreed about his education; his mother wanted him prepared for a religious career, while his father sought a legal education and diplomatic service. Either of these was a proper career for a younger son. Bowing to his father's wishes, when 15 years old, he left for the study of law at the University of Marburg.Stone, 2 Riedesel was an indifferent student, but spent time watching the Landgrave of Hesse's troops drill. An officer who had seen his interest befriended him, and later tricked him into enlisting. He was told that his father had consented to his enlistment, so at 17 he joined the Marburg battalion, only to have his allowance cut off when his angry father learned of it. The two were later reconciled, and Ensign Riedesel was granted an allowance from his father to help meet his expenses.Stone, 3 =Seven Years War= Ensign Riedesel's first assignment was near London. Riedesel knew no French nor English, but learned both while in England, and made friends with several English officers that he would later meet in the Americas. The unit was recalled to the Holy Roman Empire in 1756, for what would become the Seven Years' War.Lowell, 118 Friedrich was attached to the personal staff of Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and distinguished himself at the Battle of Minden in 1759. Riedesel also gained the attention of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, and by 1761, he was in command of two Brunswicker regiments as their Colonel. In August 1762, he was wounded in battle against the French, and sent back to Minden to recover. There he was cared for by the von Massow family and nursed by their daughter Charlotte. In December the couple wed at Paderborn and settled in Brunswick's capital city of Wolfenb√ºttel, where they lived quietly for several years. During these years, Riedesel commuted to Brunswick, where he was adjutant to the duke. He also fathered three daughters: Gustava (1771-1805), Frederica (1774-1854), and Caroline (1776-1861). =American War of Independence= Friedrich Adolf Riedesel, ca 1790 When the American Revolution broke out in 1775, the British government found itself in need of trained troops to suppress the rebellion. The rulers of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel came from the Bevern line of the House of Brunswick-L√ºneburg, while the British throne was occupied by the Hanover line of the same family. In 1776, Duke Charles I signed a treaty with George III of the United Kingdom to provide 4,000 foot soldiers and 350 heavy dragoons for British service. On 18 March, they sailed from Stade with the newly promoted Major General Riedesel as their commander. After a stop over in England, they arrived in Quebec City on 1 June. They supported the final expulsion from Canada of the American forces during the invasion of Canada. They were then distributed for the winter through various posts in Canada. General Riedesel was put in command of all GermanRiedesel's soldiers are mistakenly referred to as \\"Hessians\\" by some Americans, but were correctly identified as Brunswickers by their contemporaries. and American Indian forces during the Saratoga campaign of 1777. His letters to the Duke of Brunswick reveal discontent with British Generals Burgoyne and Howe. One example of Riedesel's disagreements with Burgoyne came after his victory at the Battle of Hubbardton, when rebels under Seth Warner gathered to attack loyalists under Philip Skene at Castle Town, Vermont. General Riedesel had promised protection to the loyalists, and wanted to attack the rebels at once. Burgoyne stalled, however, and ordered Riedesel to continue his advance instead of stopping to fight Warner's militia.Ketchum, 235-237 General Riedesel warned the Duke of Brunswick that even if the campaign went well, they could not hope to be back to Germany in 1778.Eelking, 271-272 During the campaign, Riedesel showed an ability to adapt to combat in the American wilderness. He issued new orders to his army to attack in open order from cover of trees, and when forced to fight in the open, to close order and immediately charge with the bayonet.Eelking, 272-273 Riedesel‚Äôs wife, Frederika Charlotte, became herself a relevant actor. She traveled to Canada with her infant daughters to be with her husband on the campaign. Her Letters and Journals Relating to the War of the American Revolution and the Capture of the German Troops at Saratoga is an important resource for knowledge of the campaign and its key personalities. Her harrowing account of her experiences in what is now known as the Marshall House where her husband had sent her to seek shelter during the closing days of the siege at Saratoga is one of the vivid episodes of the American Revolution. Riedesel and his wife were captured when General John Burgoyne surrendered after the Battle of Saratoga in 1777. He was imprisoned with the Convention Army in Charlottesville, Virginia at the Albemarle Barracks. They transferred to New York, where General Riedesel spent a year on parole, before being exchanged for American General William Thompson.Baroness von Riedesel from the PBS series Liberty!. Website accessed 9 July 2010. The Baron commanded troops on Long Island in Winter 1780-81. In 1781, Quebec governor Frederick Haldimand named Riedesel officer in charge of the Sorel District, where he and his family stayed until his departure from North America at the end of Summer 1784. According to Charlotte's diary Stone and local lore, the Riedesels introduced the custom of an illuminated Christmas tree in North America while in Sorel in 1781. Christmas Tree at Sorel. Website accessed 14 December 2019. A detailed account of Riedesel's work in Sorel and along the Richelieu River can be found in the Haldimand Collection in the National Archives of Canada (mainly in the series 136 to 139). = Return to Europe = General Riedesel returned to Europe in late 1783, sailing first to England. He led the remainder of his Brunswick troops to a review by Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick, who had become the ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenb√ºttel in 1780, while his army was being held captive in the United States. Riedesel was promoted to Lieutenant-General in 1787, and given command of the Brunswick troops in the southern provinces of Holland.http://www.revwar75.com/crown/bio.htm#riedesel He retired in 1793, but was named Commandant of the city of Braunschweig. He met John Quincy Adams in 1797, and \\"made many enquiries about America, and in particular after General Schuyler.\\" General Riedesel died at Braunschweig in 1800. = Family = General Riedesel and Charlotte had the following children, some born in North America:Von Gal√©ra, 410ffPrivate documents of the Riedesel zu Eisenbach * Hermann (1767-1767) * Philippine (1770-1771) * Auguste (1771-1805); married Count Heinrich von Reuss * Friederike (1774-1854); married Count Friedrich Wilhelm von Reden * Caroline (1776-1861); never married * Amerika (1780-1856); married Count Ernst von Bernsdorff * Canada (1782-1783) * Georg Karl (1785-1854); married Caroline Riedesel * Charlotte (1787-1848); married Wilhelm von Sch√∂ning Name Beginning with the publication of the couple's letters from the American Revolution arranged by one of his sons-in-law (von Reu√ü), the General came to be referred to as \\"von Riedesel\\" in American scholarly and popular writing.

The patent from Emperor Leopold I in 1680 which raised them to the status of Barons (Freiherren) did not designate them as \\"von.\\" In the initial volume of the authorized history of the family (1923), the author E.

The complete text is preserved in the 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus, where it appears immediately after the New Testament and before the Shepherd of Hermas. For several centuries it was one of the \\"antilegomena\\" writings that some Christians looked on as sacred scripture, while others excluded them. Eusebius of Caesarea classified it as such. It is mentioned in a perhaps third-century list in the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus and in the later Stichometry of Nicephorus appended to the ninth-century Chronography of Nikephoros I of Constantinople. Some early Fathers of the Church ascribed it to the Barnabas who is mentioned in the Acts of the Apostles, but it is now generally attributed to an otherwise unknown early Christian teacher, perhaps of the same name. It is distinct from the Gospel of Barnabas.  Manuscript tradition  The Codex Sinaiticus contains the Epistle of Barnabas under the heading ŒíŒëŒ°ŒùŒëŒíŒë ŒïŒ†ŒôŒ£Œ§ŒüŒõŒó. beginning at Quire 91, folio 2r, col. 2.Reproduction of Codex Sinaiticus with GO TO (Barnabas) The 4th-century Codex Sinaiticus (S), discovered by Constantin von Tischendorf in 1859 and published by him in 1862, contains a complete text of the Epistle placed after the canonical New Testament and followed by the Shepherd of Hermas. The 11th-century Codex Hierosolymitanus (H), which also includes the Didache, the two Epistles of Clement and the longer version of the Letters of Ignatius of Antioch, is another witness to the full text. It was discovered by Philotheos Bryennios at Constantinople in 1873 and published by him in 1875. Adolf Hilgenfeld used it for his 1877 edition of the Epistle of Barnabas. A family of 10 or 11 manuscripts dependent on the 11th-century Codex Vaticanus graecus 859 (G) contain chapters 5:7b‚àí21:9 placed as a continuation of a truncated text of Polycarp's letter to the Philippians (1:1‚Äì9:2). An old Latin version (L), perhaps of no later than the end of the 4th century, that is preserved in a single 9th-century manuscript (St Petersburg, Q.v.I.39) gives the first 17 chapters (without the Two Ways section of chapters 18 to 21) This is a fairly literal rendering in general, but is sometimes significantly shorter than the Greek text. S and H generally agree on readings. G often agrees with L against S and H. A small papyrus fragment (PSI 757) of the third or fourth century has the first 6 verses of chapter 9, and there are a few fragments in Syriac of chapters 1, 19,20. The writings of Clement of Alexandria give a few brief quotations, as to a smaller extent do Origen, Didymus the Blind and Jerome.James Carleton Paget, \\"The Epistle of Barnabas\\" in Paul Foster (editor), The Writings of the Apostolic Fathers (Bloomsbury 2007), p. 73James N.

Meade, The Biblical Canon Lists from Early Christianity: Texts and Analysis (Oxford University Press 2017), p. 107 Eusebius (260/265 ‚Äì 339/340), excluded it from \\"the accepted books\\", classifying it as among the \\"rejected\\" or \\"spurious\\" (ŒΩœåŒ∏ŒøŒπ) writings, while also applying to it, as to many others, the term \\"the disputed books\\", but not the description \\"the disputed writings, which are nevertheless recognized by many\\", a class composed of the Epistle of James, the Second Epistle of Peter, and the Second and the Third Epistle of John. As for the Book of Revelation, Eusebius says it was rejected by some but by others placed among the accepted books.Eusebius of Caesarea ‚Äî On The Canon of the New Testament In the sixth-century Codex Claromontanus a list, dating from the third or fourth century, of Old Testament and New Testament books mentions, with an indication of doubtful or disputed canonicity, the Epistle of Barnabas along with the Pastor of Hermas, the Acts of Paul and the Apocalypse of Peter.Catalogue inserted in Codex ClaromontanusStichometric list in Codex Claromontanus (about A.D. 400) The Stichometry of Nicephorus, a later list of uncertain date appended to the Chronography of the early 9th century Nikephoros I of Constantinople, puts the Epistle of Barnabas among its four \\"disputed\\" New Testament works ‚Äî along with the Book of Revelation, the Revelation of Peter and the Gospel of the Hebrews ‚Äî but not among its seven \\"New Testament apocrypha\\".The Stichometery of Nicephorus (9th century?)Erwin Preuschen, Analecta (1893), pp. 157‚àí158  Date of composition  In 16.3‚Äì4, the Epistle of Barnabas reads: As commonly interpreted, this passage places the Epistle after the destruction of the Second Temple in AD 70. It also places the Epistle before the Bar Kochba Revolt of AD 132, after which there could have been no hope that the Romans would help to rebuild the temple. The document must therefore come from the period between the two Jewish revolts. Attempts at identifying a more precise date are conjectures.\\"Epistle of Barnabas 16.1-5\\" in Judaism and Rome The Encyclop√¶dia Britannica puts the latest possible date at AD 130. and for the actual date of composition gives \\"circa AD 100\\".\\"Types of Biblical Hermeneutics\\" in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Its 1911 edition opted strongly for \\"the reign of Vespasian (AD 70-79)\\", shortly after the Catholic Encyclopedia had preferred AD 130‚àí131 in an article by Paulin Ladeuze,Paulin Ladeuze, \\"Epistle of Barnabas\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) and AD 96‚àí98 in an article by John Bertram Peterson.John Bertram Peterson, \\"The Apostolic Fathers\\" in The Catholic Encyclopedia (New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907) On a more precise dating within the limits associated with the Jerusalem temple there is thus an \\"absence of scholarly consensus\\".James N.

On the contrary, what Barnabas presents here is from 'the school of the evangelists'. This demonstrates how the early Christian communities paid special attention to the exploration of Scripture in order to understand and tell the suffering of Jesus. Barnabas still represents the initial stages of the process that is continued in the Gospel of Peter, later in Matthew, and is completed in Justin Martyr.\\"Helmut Koester, Introduction to the New Testament (Walter de Gruyter 1995), vol. 2, p. 281; original: Helmut K√∂ster, Einf√ºhrung in das Neue Testament im Rahmen der Religionsgeschichte und Kulturgeschichte der hellenistischen und r√∂mischen Zeit (Walter de Gruyter 1980), p. 716 An opposing view is enunciated by Everett Ferguson: \\"The language of rebuilding the temple in 16.3‚Äì5 refers to the spiritual temple of the heart of Gentile believers (any allusion to a physical temple in Jerusalem is doubtful).\\" On the date of composition he says: \\"The Epistle of Barnabas is usually dated to 130‚àí135, although an earlier date in the late 70s has had its champions, and 96‚àí98 is a possibility.\\"Everett Ferguson, Encyclopedia of Early Christianity (Routledge 2013), p. 168  Provenance  The place of origin is generally taken to be Alexandria in Egypt. It is first attested there (by Clement of Alexandria). Its allegorical style points to Alexandria. Barnabas 9:6 mentions idol-worshipping priests as circumcised, a practice in use in Egypt. However, some scholars have suggested an origin in Syria or Asia Minor.Johannes Quasten, Patrology (Christian Classics) vol. 1, p. 89Aune (2003), p. 72 Treat comments on the provenance of the Epistle of Barnabas:Jay Curry Treat in The Anchor Bible Dictionary (1992) v. 1, p. 613  Contents  The Epistle of Barnabas has the form not so much of a letter (it lacks indication of identity of sender and addressees) as of a treatise. In this, it is like the Epistle to the Hebrews, which Tertullian ascribed to the apostle BarnabasF.F.

Chapters 1‚àí17 give a Christ-centred interpretation of the Old Testament, which it says should be understood spiritually, not in line with the literal meaning of its rules on sacrifice (chapter 2: the sacrifice God wants is that of a contrite heart), fasting (3: the fasting God wants is from injustice), circumcision (9), diet (10: rules that really prohibit behaviour such as praying to God only when in need, like swine crying out when hungry but ignoring their master when full, or being predatory like eagle, falcon, kite and crow, etc.; and that command to chew by meditating the cud of the word of the Lord and to divide the hoof by looking for the holy world to come while walking in this world), sabbath (15), and the temple (16). The passion and death of Jesus at the hands of the Jews, it says, is foreshadowed in the properly understood rituals of the scapegoat (7) and the red heifer (8) and in the posture assumed by Moses in extending his arms (according to the Greek Septuagint text known to the author of the Epistle) in the form of the execution cross, while Joshua, whose name in Greek is ·º∏Œ∑œÉŒø·ø¶œÇ (Jesus), fought against Amalek (12). The last four chapters, 18‚àí21, are a version of The Two Ways teaching that appears also in chapters 1‚àí5 of the Didache.James N.

Rhodes, \\"Barnabas, Epistle of\\" in New Catholic Encyclopedia As viewed by Andrew Louth, the author \\"is simply concerned to show that the Old Testament Scriptures are Christian Scriptures and that the spiritual meaning is their real meaning\\".Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987), \\"real meaning\\" As viewed by Bart D. Ehrman, the Epistle of Barnabas is \\"more anti-Jewish than anything that did make it into the New Testament\\". = Midrash and gematria = According to David Dawson, \\"the Jewish mind-set of Barnabas, evident in its choice of images and examples, is unmistakable\\". He says that the work's two-part structure, with a distinct second part beginning with chapter 18, and its exegetical method \\"provide the most striking evidence of its Jewish perspective. It is presented as a talmud or didachƒì ('teaching') divided into haggadah and halakhah. It uses Philonic allegorical techniques to interpret fragments of Septuagint passages, in the manner of the midrashim. Finally, it applies biblical texts to its own contemporary historical situation in a manner reminiscent of the pesher technique found at Qumran.\\"David Dawson, Allegorical Readers and Cultural Revision in Ancient Alexandria (University of California Press 1991), p. 175 The creative interpretation of Bible texts, that is most typically found in rabbinic literature and is known as midrash, appears also in the New Testament and other early Christian works, where it is utilized with the prior assumption that the whole of the Bible relates to Christ.Miguel P√©rez Fern√°ndez, \\"Midrash and the New Testament\\" in Reimund Bieringer (editor), \\"The New Testament and Rabbinic Literature\\" (BRILL 2010), p. 367 James L. Bailey judges as correct the classification as midrash of the frequent use by the evangelists of texts from the Hebrew Bible,James L. Bailey, Literary Forms in the New Testament: A Handbook (Westminster John Knox Press 1992), p. 157 and Daniel Boyarin applies this in particular to the Prologue (1:1‚àí18) of the Gospel of John.Daniel Boyarin, \\"Logos, A Jewish Word: John's Prologue as Midrash\\" in Amy-Jill Levine, Marc Zvi Brettler (editor) The Jewish Annotated New Testament (Oxford University Press 2017), pp. 688‚Äì691 Other instances of New Testament allegorical interpretations of the Old Testament scriptures as foreshadowing Jesus are , and .\\"The Epistle of Barnabas: An Early Example of Allegorical Interpretation of the Old Testament\\" (Northern Kentucky University) Other examples of midrash-like exegesis are found in the accounts of the temptation of Christ in Matthew and Luke,Birger Gerhardsson, The Testing of God's Son: (Matt. 4:1-11 & PAR), An Analysis of an Early Christian Midrash (Wipf and Stock 2009), p. 11 and of circumstances surrounding the birth of Jesus. Midrashic presentation of a writer's own views on the basis of the sacred texts was subject to well-established rules but some scholars, due to their failure to recognize the meaning and use of midrash, have evaluated pejoratively the use of scripture by such as Matthew.George Wesley Buchanan, The Gospel of Matthew (Wipf and Stock 2006), p. 26 Similar negative judgments have been expressed on the abundant use of midrashTim Hegedus, \\"Midrash and the Letter of Barnabas\\" in Biblical Theology Bulletin: Journal of Bible and Culture, volume 38, issue 1 (2007), pp. 20-26Robert A. Kraft, The Epistle of Barnabas: Its quotations and their sources (Harvard University 1961) in the Epistle of Barnabas. In 1867, Alexander Roberts and James Donaldson, in their Ante-Nicene Christian Library, disparaged the Epistle for what it called \\"the absurd and trifling interpretations of Scripture which it suggests\\".\\"The Epistle of Barnabas\\" in Ante-Nicene Christian Library, vol. I (T&T; Clark, Edinburgh 1867) The Epistle of Barnabas also employs another technique of ancient Jewish exegesis, that of gematria, the ascription of religious significance to the numerical value of letters. When applied to letters of the Greek alphabet, it is also called isopsephia. A well-known New Testament instance of its use is in the Book of Revelation, \\"Let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666\\", which is often interpreted as referring to the name \\"Nero Caesar\\" written in Hebrew characters.Larry W. Hurtado, The Earliest Christian Artifacts: Manuscripts and Christian Origins (Eerdmans 2006) The interpretation of Genesis 17:23‚Äì27 in Barnabas 9:7‚Äì8 is considered \\"a classic example\\" of allegorical or midrashic interpretation:Roy B. Zuck, Basic Bible Interpretation: A Practical Guide to Discovering Biblical Truth (David C. Cook 2002), p. 33William W. Klein, Craig L. Blomberg, Robert L. Hubbard, Jr. (editors), Introduction to Biblical Interpretation (Zondervan 2017) \\"In reading the story of Abraham circumcising his household, his eye fell on the figure 318 which appeared in the scroll as Œ§ŒôŒó. Now ŒôŒó was a familiar contraction of the sacred name of Jesus, and is so written in the Alexandrian papyri of the period; and the letter Œ§ looked like the cross.\\"Philip Carrington, The Early Christian Church: Volume 1, The First Christian Church (Cambridge University Press 2011), p. 491 The same gematria was adopted by Clement of Alexandria and by several other Church Fathers: William Barclay notes that, because the letter T is shaped exactly like the crux commissa and because the Greek letter T represented the number 300, \\"wherever the fathers came across the number 300 in the Old Testament they took it to be a mystical prefiguring of the cross of Christ\\".William Barclay, The Apostles' Creed (Westminster John Knox Press, 1998), p. 79 Philip Carrington says: \\"Barnabas can be artificial, irritating, and censorious; but it would not be fair to judge him by his less fortunate expositions. His interpretation of the unclean beasts and fishes was in line with the thought of his time, being found in the Letter of Aristeas, for instance. His numerology was also a fashionable mode of thought, though the modern scholar is often impatient with it.\\" Robert A. Kraft states that some of the materials used by the final editor \\"certainly antedate the year 70, and are in some sense 'timeless' traditions of Hellenistic Judaism (e.g., the food law allegories of ch. 10, the Two Ways). It is with such materials that much of the importance of the epistle for our understanding of early Christianity and its late-Jewish heritage rests.\\"Robert A. Kraft, The Apostolic Fathers, vol. 3: Barnabas and the Didache The author's style was not a personal foible: in his time it was accepted procedure in general use, although no longer in favour today. Andrew Louth says: \\"Barnabas seems strange to modern ears: allegory is out of fashion and there is little else in the epistle. But the fashion that outlaws allegory is quite recent, and fashions change.\\"Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987) = Gnosis = In its first chapter, the Epistle states that its intention is that the \\"sons and daughters\\" to whom it is addressed should have, along with their faith, perfect knowledge.Chapter 1:5 The knowledge (in Greek, Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ, gnosis) that the first part (chapters 1‚àí17) aims to impart is \\"an essentially practical Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ, somewhat mystical in character, which seeks to make known the deeper sense of scripture\\". The first part, of an exclusively exegetical character, provides a spiritual interpretation of scripture.James Carleton Paget, The Epistle of Barnabas: Outlook and Background (Mohr Siebeck 1994), pp. 46‚àí47Richard Patrick Crosland Hanson, Allegory and Event: A Study of the Sources and Significance of Origen's Interpretation of Scripture (Westminster John Knox Press 2002), p. 97Maxwell Staniforth, Andrew Louth, Early Christian Writings: The Apostolic Fathers (Penguin UK 1987), \\"gnosis\\" The second part opens with a declaration (chapter 18:1) that it is turning to \\"another knowledge\\" (Œ≥ŒΩ·ø∂œÉŒπœÇ). This second gnosis is \\"the knowledge of the will of God, the art of enumerating and specifying his commandments, and applying them to various situations\\", a halakhic, as opposed to an exegetical, gnosis.Birger A. Pearson, \\"Earliest Christianity in Egypt\\" in James E. Goehring, Janet A. Timbie (editors), The World of Early Egyptian Christianity (CUA Press 2007), p. 102 The gnosis of the Epistle of Barnabas by no means links it with Gnosticism. On the contrary, it shows \\"an implicit anti-Gnostic stance\\": \\"Barnabas's gnosis can be seen as a precursor of the gnosis of Clement of Alexandria, who distinguished the 'true' gnosis from the 'knowledge falsely so-called' espoused by heretics\\". = Scriptural quotations = Contrary to the views of Helmut Koester and Jay Curry Treat, cited above in relation to the date of composition of the Epistle, the authors of The Comprehensive New Testament say the Epistle of Barnabas quotes from the New Testament gospels twice (4:14, 5:9).Clontz, T.E. and J., \\"The Comprehensive New Testament\\", Cornerstone Publications (2008), On the other hand, the Epistle abundantly cites the Old Testament in the Septuagint version, including therefore the deuterocanonical books. The Old Testament material appears as allusions and paraphrases as well as explicit quotations. However, the work in no way distinguishes its quotations from sacred scripture from its quotations from other works, some of which are now unknown. Thus it is not clear whether material in the Epistle that, though not an exact quotation, resembles 1 Enoch (4:3; 16:5) or 4 Esdras (12:1) attributes to the supposed sources exactly the same status as books now considered canonical. Besides, the Epistle sometimes presents as quotations what are rather free paraphrases, while at other times it gives identifiable phrases without any introductory phrase to indicate that it is quoting.Reidar Hvalvik, The Struggle for Scripture and Covenant: The Purpose of the Epistle of Barnabas and Jewish-Christian Competition in the Second Century (Mohr Siebeck 1996), p. 333  Notes   External links  * * Greek text of Epistle of Barnabas * Early Christian Writings: Epistle of Barnabas; e-texts of translations and introductions * Biblicalaudio Letter of Barnabas 2012 Translation & Audio Version *The Epistle of Barnabas: Its Quotations and Their Sources Robert A.

The stencil is both the resulting image or pattern and the intermediate object; the context in which stencil is used makes clear which meaning is intended. In practice, the (object) stencil is usually a thin sheet of material, such as paper, plastic, wood or metal, with letters or a design cut from it, used to produce the letters or design on an underlying surface by applying pigment through the cut-out holes in the material. The key advantage of a stencil is that it can be reused to repeatedly and rapidly produce the same letters or design. Although aerosol or painting stencils can be made for one-time use, typically they are made with the intention of being reused. To be reusable, they must remain intact after a design is produced and the stencil is removed from the work surface. With some designs, this is done by connecting stencil islands (sections of material that are inside cut-out \\"holes\\" in the stencil) to other parts of the stencil with bridges (narrow sections of material that are not cut out). Stencil technique in visual art is also referred to as pochoir. A related technique (which has found applicability in some surrealist compositions) is aerography, in which spray-painting is done around a three- dimensional object to create a negative of the object instead of a positive of a stencil design. This technique was used in cave paintings dating to 10,000 BC, where human hands were used in painting handprint outlines among paintings of animals and other objects. The artist sprayed pigment around his hand by using a hollow bone, blown by mouth to direct a stream of pigment. Screen printing also uses a stencil process, as does mimeography. The masters from which mimeographed pages are printed are often called \\"stencils\\". Stencils can be made with one or many colour layers using different techniques, with most stencils designed to be applied as solid colours. During screen printing and mimeography, the images for stenciling are broken down into color layers. Multiple layers of stencils are used on the same surface to produce multi- colored images. History Writing an Arabic phrase by stencil and cinnamon powder on Iranian dessert, Sholezard. Prehistoric hand stencils, Cueva de las Manos in Argentina Hand stencils, made by blowing pigment over a hand held against a wall, are found from over 35,000 years ago in Asia and Europe, and later prehistoric dates in other continents. \\"The minimum age for (the outline of the hand) is 39,900 years old, which makes it the oldest hand stencil in the world,\\" said Dr Aubert. \\"Next to it is, and this is one of the oldest figurative depictions in the world, if not the oldest one,\\" he told BBC News. There are also paintings in the caves that are around 27,000 years old, which means that the inhabitants were painting for at least 13,000 years.\\" Abstract: \\"... minimum ages of 40.8 thousand years for a red disk, 37.3 thousand years for a hand stencil, and 35.6 thousand years for a claviform-like symbol\\". After that stenciling has been used as a historic painting technique on all kinds of materials. Stencils may have been used to color cloth for a very long time; the technique probably reached its peak of sophistication in Katazome and other techniques used on silks for clothes during the Edo period in Japan. In Europe, from about 1450 they were commonly used to color old master prints printed in black and white, usually woodcuts.Mayor, Hyatt A., Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 51, 65, 80, This was especially the case with playing-cards, which continued to be colored by stencil long after most other subjects for prints were left in black and white.Mayor, Hyatt A., Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, no. 15, Stencils were used for mass publications, as the type did not have to be hand-written. Book illustration Stencils were popular as a method of book illustration, and for that purpose, the technique was at its height of popularity in France during the 1920s when Andr√© Marty, Jean Saud√© and many other studios in Paris specialized in the technique. Low wages contributed to the popularity of the highly labor-intensive process.Jan Juffermans (2003). Kees van Dongen: The Graphic Work Lund Humphries Publishers, When stencils are used in this way they are often called \\"pochoir\\". In the pochoir process, a print with the outlines of the design was produced, and a series of stencils were used through which areas of color were applied by hand to the page. To produce detail, a collotype could be produced which the colors were then stenciled over.David Pankow (1997). Tempting the palette. Pochoir was frequently used to create prints of intense color and is most often associated with Art Nouveau and Art Deco design.The University of Cincinnati The Art of the Pochoir Book, University of CincinnatiSmithsonian Institution Vibrant Visions, Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum Library Aerosol stencils \\"Happy 1984\\" ‚Äî Stencil graffiti found on the Berlin Wall in 2005. The object depicted is a DualShock video game controller. Stencil used for identification (drum case at The Allman Brothers Museum) Aerosol stencils have many practical applications and the stencil concept is used frequently in industrial, commercial, artistic, residential and recreational settings, as well as by the military, government and infrastructure management. A template is used to create an outline of the image. Stencils templates can be made from any material which will hold its form, ranging from plain paper, cardboard, plastic sheets, metals, and wood. =Official use= Stencils are frequently used by official organizations, including the military, utility companies, and governments, to quickly and clearly label objects, vehicles, and locations. Stencils for an official application can be customized, or purchased as individual letters, numbers, and symbols. This allows the user to arrange words, phrases and other labels from one set of templates, unique to the item being labeled. When objects are labeled using a single template alphabet, it makes it easier to identify their affiliation or source. =Stencil graffiti= Stencils have also become popular for graffiti, since stencil art using spray-paint can be produced quickly and easily. These qualities are important for graffiti artists where graffiti is illegal or quasi-legal, depending on the city and stenciling surface. The extensive lettering possible with stencils makes it especially attractive to political artists. For example, the anarcho-punk band Crass used stencils of anti-war, anarchist, feminist and anti-consumerist messages in a long-term graffiti campaign around the London Underground system and on advertising billboards. There has been a semi-recent trend in making multi-layered stencils with different shades of grey for each layer creating a more detailed stenciled image.Crass Discography (Christ's Reality Asylum) Retrieved on November 11, 2007. Also well known for their use of stencil art is Blek le Rat and Jef aerosol from France, British artist Banksy, New York artist, world traveling artist Tavar Zawacki f.k.a. 'ABOVE', Shepard Fairey's OBEY, and Pirate & Acid from Hollywood, California. Home stenciling  A common tradition for stencils is in home decorating and arts & crafts. Home decor stencils are an important part of the DIY (Do It Yourself) industry. There are prefabricated stencil templates available for home decoration projects from hardware stores, arts & crafts stores and through the internet. Stencils are usually applied in the home with a paint or roller brush along wall borders and as trim. They can also be applied with a painted sponge for a textured effect. Stencil templates can be purchased or constructed individually. Typically they are constructed of flexible plastics, including acetate, mylar, and vinyl. Stencils can be used as children's toys. Military stenciling Stencils have been used in the military across most nations for many years and continue to be used today. They are used to mark up equipment, vehicles, rations, signposts, helmets, etc. One use of military stencils was the application of playing card designs to USA Airborne helmets during World War Two as a method to identify regimental units. Silk screening Silk screening is a type of printing on paper or textiles, in which an ink is embedded in the cloth. The ink is controlled through the use of a stencil, which is placed directly over the paper or textile. This process can only handle one color of ink at a time. Therefore, multi-colored designs must be silk screened several times, with each interval taking time to dry. Micro- and nanostencil Stencils are also used in micro- and nanotechnology, as miniature shadow masks through which material can be deposited, etched or ions implanted onto a substrate. These stencils are usually made out of thin (100-500 nm) low-stress SiN in which apertures are defined by various lithographic techniques (e. g. electron beam, photolithography). Stencil lithography has unique advantages compared to other patterning techniques: it does not require spinning of a uniform layer of resist (therefore patterns can be created on 3D topographies) and it does not involve any heat or chemical treatment of the substrate (like baking, developing and removing the resist). Thus it allows a wide range of substrates (e.g. flexible, surface-treated) and materials (e. g. organics) to be used. Other stencil forms =Screen printing= A stencil technique is employed in screen printing which uses a tightly woven mesh screen coated in a thin layer of emulsion to reproduce the original image. As the stencil is attached to the screen, a contiguous template is not necessary. =Airbrushing= A stencil used in airbrushing called a frisket is pressed directly on the artwork. It can be used control or contain overspray, create sharp or complex shapes, but is not designed to be used more than once. =Wall stencils= Wall stencils - to decorate walls and ceilings or create your own repeat for an overall modern wall pattern effect. =Rock art= One form of pictograph found in ancient and traditional rock paintings is created by the hand first being placed against the panel, with dry paint then being blown onto it through a tube, in a process that is akin to air-brush or spray-painting. The resulting image is a negative print of the hand, and is sometimes described as a \\"stencil\\" in Australian archaeology. Miniature rock art of the stencilled variety at a rock shelter known as Yilbilinji, in the Limmen National Park in the Northern Territory, is one of only three known examples of such art. Usually stencilled art is life-size, using body parts as the stencil, but the 17 images of designs of human figures, boomerangs, animals such as crabs and long-necked turtles, wavy lines and geometric shapes are very rare. Found in 2017 by archaeologists, the only other recorded examples are at Nielson's Creek in New South Wales and at Kisar Island in Indonesia. It is thought that the designs may have been created by stencils fashioned out of beeswax.

The 93 species are divided into 11 genera. The woodshrikes (Tephrodornis) were often considered to be in this family but are now placed in their own family, Vangidae, along with the philentomas and the flycatcher-shrikes. Another genus, Chlamydochaera, which has one species, the black-breasted fruithunter, was often placed in this family but has now been shown to be a thrush (Turdidae). Taxonomy Cuckooshrikes are not closely related to either the cuckoos or to the shrikes; the name probably comes from the grey colour of many of the cuckooshrikes. Some of the species also bear a superficial resemblance to cuckoos, and have a similar undulating flight. The grey colouration has led to one of their other names, the greybird. In some parts of the world they have also been known as caterpillar-birds, a name derived from their diet. Although unsuspected earlier, DNA studies have suggested they may be related to the Old World orioles (Oriolidae), although they differ strongly in some morphological characteristics (such as skull morphology and the arrangements of feathers on the wing). A molecular phylogenetic study of the Campephegadae published in 2010 found that the speciose genus Coracina was non-monophyletic. In the resulting reorganization to create monophyletic genera five genera were resurrected. A large group of species previously assigned to Coracina was moved to Edolisoma and a group of Asian and Indian Ocean cuckooshrikes was moved to Lalage. The African cuckooshrikes were moved to Ceblepyris, and three species were placed in monotypic genera: McGregor's cuckooshrike was moved to Malindangia, the pygmy cuckooshrike was moved to Celebesica and the blue cuckooshrike was moved to Cyanograucalus. Description Overall the cuckooshrikes are medium to small arboreal birds, generally long and slender. The smallest species is the small minivet at and , while the largest is the south Melanesian cuckooshrike at and .National Geographic Complete Birds of the World by Jonathan Alderfer. National Geographic (2009), . They are predominantly greyish with white and black, although the minivets are brightly coloured in red, yellow and black, and the blue cuckooshrike of central Africa is all-over glossy blue. The four cuckooshrikes in the genus Campephaga exhibit sexual dimorphism, with males that have glossy black plumage and bright red or yellow wattles, the females having more subdued olive-green plumage. Habitat Of the 93 species of cuckooshrike, the majority are forest birds. Some species are restricted to primary forest, like the New Caledonian cuckooshrike, others are able to use more disturbed forest. Around eleven species use much more open habitat, one Australian species, the ground cuckooshrike being found in open plains and scrubland with few trees. Behaviour Nesting ground cuckooshrike The 'true' cuckooshrikes are usually found singly, in pairs, and in small family groups, whereas the minivets, flycatcher-shrikes and wood-shrikes more frequently form small flocks. There is a considerable amount of variation within the family as a whole with regards to calls, some call very infrequently and some, principally the minivets, are extremely vocal. These are mainly insectivorous, and will take large hairy caterpillars. They have also been recorded eating small vertebrates, and some fruit, seeds and other plant matter. Information about the breeding of this family is incomplete, with many species having never been studied. In all the species studied the cuckooshrikes are territorial; in species that do not migrate these territories are maintained year-round. Cuckooshrikes are monogamous, with the pair bonds apparently lasting throughout the year. Only one instance of non-monogamous breeding has been recorded, an instance of polygyny in white-winged trillers in Australia, where one male aided two females in raising their young. Several species of cuckooshrike exhibit cooperative breeding. About four blotchy white, green or blue eggs are laid in a cup nest in a tree. Incubation is about two weeks. List of genera The family contains 93 species divided in 11 genera: * Pericrocotus ‚Äì minivets (15 species) * Ceblepyris ‚Äì cuckooshrikes (5 species) * Coracina ‚Äì cuckooshrikes (22 species) * Campephaga ‚Äì cuckooshrikes (4 species) * Lobotos ‚Äì wattled cuckooshrikes (2 species) * Campochaera ‚Äì golden cuckooshrike * Malindangia ‚Äì McGregor's cuckooshrike * Edolisoma ‚Äì cuckooshrikes and cicadabirds (22 species) * Celebesica ‚Äì pygmy cuckooshrike * Cyanograucalus ‚Äì blue cuckooshrike * Lalage ‚Äì trillers and cuckooshrikes (19 species) References *del Hoyo.

Tallemant des Reaux, Historiettes de la princesse de Conti, et du mar√©chal de Bassompierre (Paris, 1854‚Äì1860). In 1614, he assisted Marie de' Medici, now queen mother, in her struggle against the nobles, but upon her failure in 1617 remained loyal to the young king Louis XIII and assisted the royalists when they routed Marie's supporters at Les Ponts-de-C√© in 1620. His services during the Huguenot rising of 1621‚Äì22 won for him the dignity of marshal of France. He was with the army of the king during the siege of La Rochelle in 1628, and in 1629 distinguished himself in the campaign against the Huguenot rebels of Languedoc, especially at the Siege of Privas. In 1615 Bassompierre had purchased from Henri, duc de Rohan, the coveted position of colonel-general of the Swiss and Grisons; on this account he was sent to raise troops in Switzerland when Louis XIII marched against Savoy in 1629, and after a short campaign in Italy his military career ended. As a diplomat, his career was a failure. In 1621, he went to Madrid as envoy extraordinary to arrange the dispute concerning the seizure of the Valtelline forts by Spain, and signed the fruitless Treaty of Madrid. In 1625, he was sent into Switzerland on an equally futile mission, and in 1626 to London to secure the retention of the Catholic ecclesiastics and attendants of Henrietta Maria, wife of King Charles I of England. The personal influence of Henry IV had deterred Bassompierre from a marriage with Charlotte de Montmorency, daughter of the constable Montmorency, afterwards princesse de Cond√©, and between 1614 and 1630 he was secretly married to Louise Marguerite, widow of Fran√ßois, prince de Conti, and through her became implicated in the plot to overthrow Richelieu on the \\"Day of the Dupes\\" (1630). His share was only a slight one, but his wife was an intimate friend of Marie de' Medici, and her hostility to the cardinal aroused his suspicions. By Richelieu's orders, Bassompierre was arrested at Senlis on February 25, 1631, and put into the Bastille, where he remained until after Richelieu's death in 1643. On his release his offices were restored to him, and he passed most of his time at the castle of Tilli√®res in Normandy, until his death. He left a son, Fran√ßois de la Tour, by the princesse de Conti (Louise Marguerite de Lorraine), and an illegitimate son, Louis de Bassompierre, afterwards Bishop of Saintes. His M√©moires, which are an important source for the history of his time, were first published at Cologne in 1665. He also left an incomplete account of his embassies to Spain, Switzerland and England (Cologne, 1668) and a number of discourses upon various subjects. During his embassy to Charles I of England in 1626, Bassompierre was entertained by the Master of the Ceremonies Sir Lewes Lewkenor, who escorted him to a play, 'Lucnar came to bring me a very rich present from the king, of four diamonds set in a lozenge, and a great stone at the end; and the same evening sent again to fetch me to hear an excellent English play.'Memoirs of the Marshal de Bassompierre, 1819, John Wilson Croker. p.107 References Category:1579 births Category:1646 deaths Category:People from Meurthe-et-Moselle Category:Marshals of France Category:Recipients of the Order of the Holy Spirit Category:French courtiers Category:16th-century French people Category:17th-century French people Category:Prisoners of the Bastille ","title":"Fran√ßois de Bassompierre"},{"id":"269671","text":"Seven ships of the Royal Navy have borne the name HMS Bristol, after the English port city of Bristol: * was a 48-gun ship launched in 1653, completely rebuilt in 1693, captured by the French in April 1709, recaptured two weeks later and sunk. * was a 54-gun fourth rate launched in 1711.

Wet nurses are employed if the mother dies, or if she is unable or elects not to nurse the child herself. Wet-nursed children may be known as \\"milk-siblings\\", and in some cultures the families are linked by a special relationship of milk kinship. Mothers who nurse each other's babies are engaging in a reciprocal act known as cross-nursing or co-nursing. Wetnursing existed in cultures around the world until the invention of reliable formula milk in the 20th century.  Reasons  A wet nurse can help when a mother is unable or unwilling to feed her baby. Before the development of infant formula in the 20th century, wet-nursing could save the baby's life. There are many reasons why a mother is unable to produce sufficient breast milk, or in some cases to lactate at all. Reasons include the serious or chronic illness of the mother and her treatment which creates a temporary difficulty to nursing. Additionally, a mother's taking drugs (prescription or recreational) may necessitate a wet nurse if a drug in any way changes the content of the mother's milk. There was a greater need for wetnurses when the rates of infant abandonment, and maternal death during and shortly after childbirth, were high.O'Reilly, Andrea, \\"Wet Nursing,\\" Encyclopedia of Motherhood (2010): 1271 There was a concurrent availability of lactating women whose own babies had died, also not uncommon. Some women choose not to breastfeed for social reasons. Many of these women were found to be of the upper class. For them, breastfeeding was considered unfashionable, in the sense that it not only prevented these women from being able to wear the fashionable clothing of their time but it was also thought to ruin their figures.Emily E. Stevens, Thelma E. Patrick and Rita Pickler, \\"A History of Infant Feeding,\\" Journal of Perinatal Education (Spring 2009): 32-39. (accessed February 10, 2016). Mothers also lacked the support of their husbands to breastfeed their children, since hiring a wet nurse was less expensive than having to hire someone else to help run the family business and/or take care of the family household duties in their place. Some women chose to hire wet nurses purely to escape from the confining and time-consuming chore of breastfeeding.O'Reilly, Andrea, \\"Wet Nursing,\\" Encyclopedia of Motherhood (2010): 1271. Wet nurses have also been used when a mother cannot produce sufficient breast milk, i.e., the mother feels incapable of adequately nursing her child, especially following multiple births.  Eliciting milk  Statuette of a parclose representing a woman who presses her breast to collect milk in a bowl. ‚Äì Stalls (16th century) of the (11th century) ‚Äì Walcourt (Belgium). A woman can only act as a wet-nurse if she is lactating (producing milk). It was once believed that a wet-nurse must have recently undergone childbirth. This is not necessarily the case, as regular breast suckling can elicit lactation via a neural reflex of prolactin production and secretion.E. Goljan, Pathology, 2nd ed. Mosby Elsevier, Rapid Review Series. Some adoptive mothers have been able to establish lactation using a breast pump so that they could feed an adopted infant.Wilson-Clay, Barbara (1996). \\"Induced Lactation\\". The American Surrogacy Center. Dr Gabrielle PalmerLecturer in Human Nutrition at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine and author of The Politics of Breastfeeding states:  Historical and cultural practices  A Russian wet nurse, c. 1913 Wet nursing is an ancient practice, common to many cultures. It has been linked to social class, where monarchies, the aristocracy, nobility or upper classes had their children wet-nursed for the benefit of the child's health, and sometimes in the hope of becoming pregnant again quickly. Exclusive breastfeeding inhibits ovulation in some women (Lactational amenorrhea). Poor women, especially those who suffered the stigma of giving birth to an illegitimate child, sometimes had to give their baby up temporarily to a wet nurse, or permanently to another family. The woman herself might in turn become wet nurse to a wealthier family, while using part of her wages to pay her own child's wet nurse. From Roman times and into the present day, philosophers and thinkers alike have held the view that the important emotional bond between mother and child is threatened by the presence of a wet nurse.O'Reilly, Andrea, \\"Wet Nursing,\\" Encyclopedia of Motherhood (2010): 1273. = Mythology = Many cultures feature stories, historical or mythological, involving superhuman, supernatural, human and in some instances animal wet-nurses. The Bible refers to Deborah, a nurse to Rebekah wife of Isaac and mother of Jacob (Israel) and Esau, who appears to have lived as a member of the household all her days. (Genesis 35:8.) Midrashic commentaries on the Torah hold that the Egyptian princess Bithiah (Pharaoh's wife Asiya in the Islamic Hadith and Qur'an) attempted to wet-nurse Moses, but he would take only his biological mother's milk. () In Greek mythology, Eurycleia is the wet-nurse of Odysseus. In Roman mythology, Caieta was the wet-nurse of Aeneas. In Burmese mythology, Myaukhpet Shinma is the nat (spirit) representation of the wet nurse of King Tabinshwehti. In Hawaiian mythology, Nuakea is a beneficent goddess of lactation;Native planters in old Hawaii: their life, lore, and environment by Edward Smith Craighill Handy, Elizabeth Green Handy, Mary Kawena Pukui. her name became the title for a royal wetnurse, according to David Malo.Hawaiian antiquities (Moolelo Hawaii) by David Malo =Ancient Rome= A funerary stele (akin to a gravestone) erected by Roman citizen Lucius Nutrius Gallus in the 2nd half of 1st century AD for himself, his wetnurse, and other members of his family and household In ancient Rome, well-to-do households would have had wet-nurses (Latin nutrices, singular nutrix) among their slaves and freedwomen,Keith R. Bradley, \\"Wet- Nursing at Rome: A Study in Social Relations,\\" in The Family in Ancient Rome (Cornell University Press, 1986), p. 213. but some Roman women were wet-nurses by profession, and the Digest of Roman law even refers to a wage dispute for wet-nursing services (nutricia).Bradley, \\"Wet-Nursing at Rome,\\" p. 214. The landmark known as the Columna Lactaria (\\"Milk Column\\") may have been a place where wet-nurses could be hired.Suzanne Dixon, Childhood, Class and Kin in the Roman World (Routledge, 2001), p. 62; Bradley, \\"Wet-Nursing at Rome,\\" p. 214. It was considered admirable for upperclass women to breastfeed their own children, but unusual and old-fashioned in the Imperial era.Bradley, \\"Wet- Nursing at Rome,\\" p. 201. Even women of the working classes or slaves might have their babies nursed,Bradley, \\"Wet-Nursing at Rome,\\" pp. 201‚Äì202 et passim, especially p. 210. and the Roman-era Greek gynecologist Soranus offers detailed advice on how to choose a wet-nurse.Soranus of Ephesus, Gynaecology 2.19.24‚Äì5. Inscriptions such as religious dedications and epitaphs indicate that a nutrix would be proud of her profession.Celia E. Schultz, Women's Religious Activity in the Roman Republic (University of North Carolina Press, 2006), p. 54; Bradley, \\"Wet-Nursing at Rome,\\" p. 202ff. One even records a nutritor lactaneus, a male \\"milk nurse\\" who presumably used a bottle.Evidence for bottle-feeding among the Romans is very slim, and the nutritor may have simply been a nursemaid; Bradley, \\"Wet-Nursing at Rome,\\" p. 214. Greek nurses were preferred,Soranus, Gynaecology 2.44. and the Romans believed that a baby who had a Greek nutrix could imbibe the language and grow up speaking Greek as fluently as Latin.Richard Tames, Ancient Roman Children (Heineman, 2003), p. 11. The importance of the wet nurse to ancient Roman culture is indicated by the founding myth of Romulus and Remus, who were abandoned as infants but nursed by the she-wolf, as portrayed in the famous Capitoline Wolf bronze sculpture. The goddess Rumina was invoked among other birth and child development deities to promote the flow of breast milk. India By the 1500s, a wealthy mother who did not use a wet nurse was worthy of remark in India. The child was not \\"put out\\" of the household, rather, the wet nurse was included within it. The imperial wet nurses of the Mughal court were given honours in the Turco-Mongol tradition.DƒÄYASORANƒÄGAS OF IMPERIAL MUGHAL. Balkrishan Shivram. Proceedings of the Indian History Congress Vol. 74 (2013), pp. 258-268. Published by: Indian History Congress. https://www.jstor.org/stable/44158824 =United Kingdom= Catherine Willoughby, formerly Duchess of Suffolk, and her later husband Richard Bertie, are forced into exile, taking their baby and wetnurse Wet nursing used to be commonplace in the United Kingdom. Working-class women both provided and received wet nursing services. Taking care of babies was a well-paid, respectable and popular job for many working-class women. In the 18th-century, a woman would earn more money as a wet nurse than her husband could as a labourer. Up until the 19th century, most wet-nursed infants were sent far from their families to live with their new caregiver for up to the first three years of their life.Wolf, Jacqueline H, \\"Wet Nursing\\", Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society (2004). As many as 80% of wet- nursed babies who lived like this died during infancy. During the Victorian era, women took in babies for money, and nursed them themselves or fed them with whatever was cheapest. This was known as baby-farming; poor care sometimes resulted in high infant death rates. The wet nurse at this period was most likely a single woman who previously had given birth to an illegitimate child.Acton, W., \\"Unmarried Wet Nurses\\", Lancet Vol. 1 (1859): 175. There were two types of wet nurses by this time: those on poor relief, who struggled to provide sufficiently for themselves or their charges, and the professionals, who were well paid and respected. Upper-class women tended to hire wet nurses to work within their own homes, as part of a large household of servants. Wet nurses also worked at foundling hospitals, establishments for abandoned children. Her own child would likely be sent away, normally brought up by the bottle rather than being breastfed. Valerie Fildes, author of Breasts, Bottle and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding, argues that \\"In effect, wealthy parents frequently 'bought' the life of their infant for the life of another.\\"Valerie A. Fildes, Breasts, Bottles, and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1986: 193. Wet nursing decreased in popularity during the mid-19th century, as medical journalists wrote about its previously undocumented dangers. Fildes argued that \\"Britain has been lumped together with the rest of Europe in any discussion of the qualities, terms of employment and conditions of the wet nurse, and particularly the abuses of which she was supposedly guilty.\\"Valerie A. Fildes, Breasts, Bottles, and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1986: 152. C. H. F. Routh, a medical journalist writing in the late 1850s listed the evils of wet-nursing, such as the abandonment of the wetnurses' own children, higher infant mortality, and an increased physical and moral risk to a nursed child.Routh, C. H. F., \\"On the Mortality of Infants in Foundling Institutions, and Generally, As Influenced By the Absence of Breast-Milk\\". British Medical Journal 1 (6 February 1858): 105. While this argument was not founded in any sort of proof, the emotional arguments of medical researchers, coupled with the protests of other critics, slowly increased public knowledge; the practice declined, replaced by maternal breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.Valerie A. Fildes, Breasts, Bottles, and Babies: A History of Infant Feeding, Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 1986: 243. =France= The bureau of wet nurses in Paris Wet nursing was reported in France in the time of Louis XIV, the mid 17th century. In 18th century France, approximately 90% of infants were wet nursed, mostly sent away to live with their wet nurses.O'Reilly, Andrea, \\"Wet Nursing\\", Encyclopaedia of Motherhood (2010): 1271. In Paris in 1780, only 1000 of the 21,000 babies born that year were nursed by their own mother. The high demand for wet nurses coincided with the low wages and high rent prices of this era, which forced many women to have to work soon after childbirth. This meant that many mothers had to send their infants away to be breastfed and cared for by wet nurses even poorer than themselves. With the high demand for wet nurses, the price to hire one increased as the standard of care decreased. This led to many infant deaths. In response, rather than nursing their own children, upper-class women turned to hiring wet nurses to come live with them instead. In entering into their employers home to care for their charges, these wet nurses had to leave their own infants to be nursed and cared for by women far worse off than themselves, and who likely lived at a relatively far distance away. The Bureau of Wet Nurses was created in Paris, 1769, to serve two main purposes; it supplied parents with wet nurses, as well as helped lessen the neglect of charges by controlling monthly salary payments to wet nurses. In order to become a wet nurse, women had to meet a few qualifications including a good physical body with a good moral character, they were often judged on their age, their health, the number of children they had, as well as their breast shape, breast size, breast texture, nipple shape and nipple size, since all these aspects were believed to affect the quality of a woman's milk.Paula S. Fass (ed.), \\"Wet Nursing\\", Encyclopedia of Children and Childhood in History and Society (2004): 884‚Äì887. In 1874, the French government introduced the Roussel Law, which \\"mandated that every infant placed with a paid guardian outside the parents' home be registered with the state so that the French government is able to monitor how many children are placed with wet nurses and how many wet nursed children have died\\". Wet nurses were often hired to work in hospitals so that they could nurse premature babies, babies who were ill, or babies who had been abandoned. During the 18th and 19th centuries, congenital syphilis was a common cause of infant mortality in France.Sherwood, Joan, Infection of the Innocents: Wet Nurses, Infants, and Syphilis in France, 1780-1900. McGill-Queen's University Press (2010). The Vaugirard hospital in Paris began to use mercury as a treatment for syphilis; however, it could not be safely administered to infants. In 1780, began the process of giving mercury to wet nurses who could then transmit the treatment to the infants with syphilis through their milk in the act of breastfeeding. The practice of wetnursing was still widespread during World War I, according to the American Red Cross. Working-class women would leave their babies with wetnurses so they could get jobs in factories. =United States= Enslaved black woman wet- nursing White infant British colonists brought the practice of wet nursing with them to North America. Since the arrangement of sending infants away to live with wet nurses was the cause of so many infant deaths, by the 19th century, Americans adopted the practice of having wet nurses live with the employers in order to nurse and care for their charges. This practice had the effect of increasing the death rate for wet nurses' own babies. Many employers would have only kept a wet nurse for a few months at a time since it was believed that the quality of a woman's breast milk would lessen over time. Since there were no official records kept pertaining to wet nurses or wet nursed children in the United States, historians lack the knowledge of precisely how many infants were wet-nursed, for how long they were wet-nursed, whether they lived at home or else where while they wet-nursed, as well as how many wet-nursed babies lived or died.Golden, Janet, A Social History of Wet Nursing in America: From Breast to Bottle, Cambridge University Press (1996) The only evidence which exists pertaining to wet-nursing in the United States is found in the help wanted ads of newspapers, through complaints about wet nurses in magazines, and through medical journals which acted as employment agencies for wet-nurses. In the Southern United States, it was common practice for enslaved black women to be forced to be wet nurses to their owners' children. In some instances, the enslaved child and the white child would be raised together in their younger years.O'Reilly, Andrea, \\"Wet Nursing\\", Encyclopaedia of Motherhood (2010): 1271 (Sometimes both babies would be fathered by the same man, the slave-owner; see Children of the plantation.) Visual representations of wet-nursing practices in enslaved communities are most prevalent in representations of the Mammy archetype caricature.Thompson, Barbara, ed. \\"The Body of a Myth: Embodying the Black Mammy Figure in Visual Culture\\". In Black Womanhood: Images, Icons, and Ideologies of the African Body. Hanover, New Hampshire: Hood Museum of Art, Dartmouth College, 2008. Images such as the one in this section represent both a historically accurate practice of enslaved black women wet-nursing their owner's white children as well as sometimes an exaggerated racist caricaturization of a stereotype of enslaved black women as \\"Mammy\\" characters. Relationships \\"Visite Chez la Nourrice\\" (\\"Visit to the Wetnurse\\") by Victor Adam An infant who has been living with a wet-nurse being taken away from its foster-parents by its natural mother. By √âtienne Aubry Sometimes the infant is placed in the home of the wetnurse for several months, as was the case for Jane Austen and her siblings. The Papyrus Oxyrhynchus 91, a receipt from 187 AD, attests to the ancient nature of this practice. Sometimes the wetnurse came to live with the infant's family, filling a position between the monthly nurse (for the immediate post-partum period) and the nanny. In some cultures the wetnurse is simply hired as any other employee. In others, however, she has a special relationship with the family, which may incur kinship rights. In Vietnamese family structure, for example, the wetnurse is known as Nh≈© m·∫´u, m·∫´u meaning \\"mother\\". Islam has a highly codified system of milk kinship known as rada. George III of the United Kingdom, born two months premature, had a wet nurse whom he so valued all his life that her daughter was appointed laundress to the Royal Household, \\"a sinecure place of great emolument\\". Current attitudes in Western countries In contemporary affluent Western societies such as the United States, the act of nursing a baby other than one's own often provokes cultural discomfort. When a mother is unable to nurse her own infant, an acceptable mediated substitute is expressed milk (or especially colostrum) which is donated to milk banks, analogous to blood banks, and processed there by being screened, pasteurized, and usually frozen. Infant formula is also widely available, which its makers claim can be a reliable source of infant nutrition when prepared properly. Dr Rhonda Shaw notes that Western objections to wet-nurses are cultural: In addition, the legacy of wet- nursing for African-American women is inherently linked to slavery, and the physical, emotional, and mental abuse that enslaved African-American women endured. While other populations in the United States may be more open to wet- nursing, the cultural attitude within African-American communities towards wet-nursing remains one deeply affected by the generational trauma of wet- nursing during slavery.Lutenbacher, Melanie, Sharon Karp, and Elizabeth Moore. \\"Reflections of Black Women Who Choose to Breastfeed: Influences, Challenges, and Supports\\". Maternal & Child Health Journal 20, no. 2 (February 2016): 231‚Äì239. For some Americans, the subject of wet-nursing is becoming increasingly open for discussion. During a UNICEF goodwill trip to Sierra Leone in 2008, Mexican actress Salma Hayek decided to breast-feed a local infant in front of the accompanying film crew. The sick one-week-old baby had been born the same day but a year later than her daughter, who had not yet been weaned. Hayek later discussed on camera an anecdote of her Mexican great- grandmother spontaneously breast-feeding a hungry baby in a village. Current situation elsewhere Wet nurses are still common in many developing countries, although the practice poses a risk of infections such as HIV. In China, Indonesia, and the Philippines, a wet-nurse may be employed in addition to a nanny as a mark of aristocracy, wealth, and high status. Following the 2008 Chinese milk scandal, in which contaminated infant formula poisoned thousands of babies, the salaries of wet-nurses there increased dramatically. The use of a wet-nurse is seen as a status symbol in some parts of modern China. Additionally, a woman who is difficult to get pregnant may wet-nurse and rear a relative (especially a poorer one's) new-born as a mancing (Javanese language for \\"lure\\"). Notable wetnurses Royal wetnurses are more likely than most to reach the historical record. In Ancient Egypt, Maia was the wetnurse of King Tutankhamun.N. Reeves: Akhenaten, Egypt's False Prophet, London 2001, , p. 180 Sitre In, the nurse of Hatshepsut,Eric H. Cline, David B. O'Connor, Thutmose III: A New Biography, University of Michigan Press 2006, p.98 was not a member of the royal family, but received the honour of a burial in the royal necropolis in the Valley of the Kings in tomb KV60. Her coffin has the inscription wr ≈°dt nfrw nswt In, meaning Great Royal Wet Nurse In. Lady Kasuga was the wet nurse of the third Tokugawa sh≈çgun Iemitsu. Lu Lingxuan was a lady in waiting who served as wetnurse to the emperor Gao Wei; she became exceedingly powerful during his reign, and was often criticized by historians for her corruption and treachery. Chinese emperors honoured the Nurse Empress Dowager. Dai Anga was the wetnurse of the Mughal Emperor, Shah Jahan. Shin Myo Myat was the mother of King Bayinnaung of Toungoo Dynasty of Burma (Myanmar), and the wetnurse of King Tabinshwehti. In England, Hodierna of St Albans was the mother of Alexander Neckam and wet nurse of Richard I of England, and Mrs. Pack was a wet nurse to William, Duke of Gloucester (1689‚Äì1700). Genevi√®ve Poitrine was a wet nurse of the Dauphin of France, Louis Joseph, son of King Louis XVI of France and Queen Marie Antoinette. Poitrine was accused of transmitting tuberculosis to the Dauphin, and triggering his infant death when aged seven.Arnaud Delalande. Le C≈ìur du Roi : R√©volution 1 (The Heart of the King), Grasset, 2017, . Some non-royal wetnurses have been written about. Halimah bint Abi Dhuayb was the foster- mother and wetnurse of the Islamic prophet Muhammad. Petronella Muns was, with her employer, the first Western woman to visit Japan. Naomi Baumslag, author of Milk, Money and Madness, described the legendary capacity of Judith Waterford: \\"In 1831, on her 81st birthday, she could still produce breast milk. In her prime she unfailingly produced two quarts (four pints or 1.9 litres) of breast milk a day.\\"  See also  * Drinking culture * Human‚Äìanimal breastfeeding * Roman Charity, works of art based on the story of a daughter feeding her dying father.

Biography Born at La Rochelle, he belonged to a wealthy middle-class Huguenot family; the name des R√©aux was derived from a small property he purchased in 1650. When he was about eighteen, he was sent to Italy with his brother Fran√ßois, abb√© Tallemant. On his return to Paris, Tallemant took his degrees in civil law and Canon law, and his father obtained for him the position of conseiller au parlement. Disliking his profession, he decided to seek an alternative income by marriage with his cousin Elisabeth de Rambouillet. His half-brother had married a d'Angennes, and this connection secured for Tallemant an introduction to the H√¥tel de Rambouillet. Madame de Rambouillet was no admirer of King Louis XIII, and she gratified Tallemant's curiosity with stories of the reigns of Henry IV and Louis XIII that were of real historical value. The society of the H√¥tel de Rambouillet opened a field for his acute and somewhat malicious observation. In the Historiettes he gives finished portraits of Vincent Voiture, Jean Louis Guez de Balzac, Malherbe, Jean Chapelain, Valentin Conrart and many others; Blaise Pascal and Jean de la Fontaine appear in his work; and he chronicles the scandals of which Ninon de l'Enclos and Ang√©lique Paulet were centres. The Historiettes are invaluable for the literary history of the time. It has been said that the malicious intention of Tallemant's work may be partly attributed to his bourgeois extraction and that the slights he received are avenged in his pages, but independent testimony has established the substantial correctness of his statements. In 1685 he converted to Catholicism. It seems that the change was not entirely disinterested, for Tallemant, who had suffered considerable pecuniary losses, soon after received a pension of 2,000 livres. He died in Paris. Works Des R√©aux was a poet and contributed to the Guirlande de Julie, but it is by his Historiettes that he is remembered. The work remained in manuscript until it was edited in 1834-6 by MM. de Ch√¢teaugiron, Jules Taschereau and Louis Monmerqu√©, with a notice on Tallemant by Monmerqu√©. A third edition (6 vols. 1872) contains a notice by Paulin Paris. Tallemant had begun M√©moires pour la r√©gence d'Anne d'Autriche, but the manuscript has not been found.

Fictional character biography =Origins= Colfer has said that he based Artemis on his younger brother Donal, who as a child was \\"a mischievous mastermind who could get out of any trouble he got into.\\" A childhood picture of his brother in his first communion suit caused Colfer to think of how much Colfer's brother resembled \\"a little James Bond villain\\" and \\"how funny...a twelve-year-old James Bond villain\\" would be, inspiring Colfer's creation of Artemis.Eoin Colfer interview on NBC's The Today Show on MSN Video (HTML) Retrieved 2 August 2008. Colfer planned for Artemis to have been called Archimedes but changed the name due to an interest in using a \\"classic Greek name\\" and trepidation that \\"people would think [the series] was about [the historical figure] Archimedes\\". Artemis is a notable choice for a name because while it is traditionally a female name, it \\"was [historically] sometimes‚Ä¶ given to boys as a kind of honorific if their fathers were great hunters\\", though the male equivalent of the name is usually spelled as Artimus instead of Artemis.\\"Artimus name meaning.\\" SheKnows Retrieved March 6, 2018 Fowl was derived from the Irish name Fowler as a play on words to convey the characterisation that Artemis was a nasty or foul individual at the beginning of the series. The character additionally takes the place of Hans Gruber in Colfer's description of the first book of the series as \\"Die Hard with fairies\\".Karen Springen. \\"Keeping Swashbuckling Alive.\\" Newsweek January 10, 2008, Page 2. Retrieved June 16, 2009. =Plot= Prior to the events of the first book, Artemis's father, Artemis Fowl I, imperils the family fortune by investing \\"a huge chunk of the Fowl fortune in establishing new shipping lanes\\" to Russia, following the breakdown of Communism there. The Russian Mafia retaliates by sinking a shipping vessel Artemis I was travelling on, the Fowl Star, leading to his disappearance, the loss of a substantial amount of the Fowl fortune, and the mental breakdown of his wife Angeline Fowl, Artemis's mother.Eoin Colfer (2001). Artemis Fowl. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books pp. 28‚Äì29, 19. . In Artemis Fowl, which is set two years after those events, the 12-year-old Artemis decides to regain the Fowl fortune by following leads on the Internet that refer to an underground world of fairies collectively called the People. Artemis manages to blackmail a member of the People into giving him what they call \\"the Book\\" which is like their Bible, holding all their secrets, customs, rules, and history. This leads him to ransom Lower Elements Police (LEP) Captain Holly Short for a portion of the People's gold. Artemis and Holly agree to a deal whereby Holly retains half the ransom fee, while Artemis gets one wish from Holly and gets to keep the other half of the gold. After recovering Holly, the LEP attempt to permanently eliminate Artemis by setting off a biological weapon, but are thwarted when Artemis discovers a way around their attack (something not even the People had been able to develop). In the sequel, The Arctic Incident, the 13-year-old Artemis learns that his father was only injured in the attack on his shipping vessel, and is being held hostage by the Russian Mafia. Artemis barters with the People to receive their aid in rescuing his father in exchange for assisting them in solving the mystery of who was behind a goblin rebellion. It is later revealed that Opal Koboi, a pixie criminal mastermind, and ex-LEP officer Briar Cudgeon are behind the plot. Their plan is thwarted, ending in Cudgeon's death and Koboi's arrest, and Artemis successfully recovers his father.Eoin Colfer (2002). Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 5, 8, 43, 68‚Äì69, 149‚Äì151, 253‚Äì254, 270. . In the third book, The Eternity Code, Artemis (in what he considers to be his last criminal act before his father recovers from his injuries) creates the C Cube, a mini super-computer based on the People's technology that is decades ahead of human technology. He plans to make a deal with Chicago technology businessman Jon Spiro over the Cube, but Spiro double-crosses Artemis, steals the Cube, and wounds Domovoi Butler in the process. Along with Holly Short and Foaly, Artemis succeeds in healing Butler and ensuring that Spiro does not discover the existence of the People through use of the C Cube. The C Cube is recovered, with the help of Foaly, Holly, Juliet (Butler's sister), and Mulch. But to gain the help of Foaly, Holly, and their Fairy technology, Artemis has to agree to Butler's, Juliet's and his own memories being wiped by the People, to avoid future misadventures. This happens at the end of the book.Eoin Colfer (2003). Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 2, 10‚Äì13, 18‚Äì19, 44, 70‚Äì71, 91‚Äì92, 271, 302‚Äì304. . In the fourth book, The Opal Deception, Opal Koboi, who had been lying in an institution in a faked catatonic state, escapes with the help of pixie twins Mervall and Descant Brill, and begins plotting revenge against Julius Root, Holly Short, Foaly, and Artemis. Opal frames Holly for the murder of Julius Root and nearly terminates the now 14-year-old Artemis and Butler with a biological weapon. Holly rescues Artemis after being injured while escaping Opal's weapon. But Opal still seeks revenge on Holly and Artemis, so she traps them in an abandoned amusement park (comprising copies of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World plus four extra monuments determined by the People) with only hungry trolls for company. Meanwhile, Mulch Diggums has helped Butler regain his memories and together they save Holly and Artemis in the nick of time and also return Artemis's memory. With help from Artemis, Butler, and Mulch, Holly prevents Opal from achieving her goal to uncover the Fairy People to humans.Eoin Colfer (2005). Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 4, 20‚Äì21, 26, 88, 92, 103‚Äì106, 311‚Äì312, 331. . In the fifth book, The Lost Colony, Artemis works with the People to recover a young kidnapped demon imp from the 12-year-old child prodigy Minerva Paradizo. The team succeed in finding and rescuing the imp-warlock, but Artemis and Holly Short must then work to restore the imp's home, a floating island lost in a space and time Limbo, which threatens to breach its way onto Earth. In the process, several significant changes occur within the characters' lives. Artemis receives a small amount of magical power during the trip to Limbo, and swaps an eye with Holly on the return trip. The pair finds that they have been transported nearly three years into their future. Finally, Artemis learns that in the ensuing time he has become the older brother to twins, Beckett and Myles Fowl.Eoin Colfer (2006). Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 125‚Äì128, 224‚Äì227, 373, 375, 384. . In the sixth book, The Time Paradox, Artemis' mother Angeline Fowl becomes gravely ill with a rare fairy disease called Spelltropy. Artemis attempts to cure her with his remaining magic, but it only serves to worsen her condition. The only cure for Spelltropy is found in the brain fluid of the Silky Sifaka Lemur, the last of which Artemis sold in a business deal when he was ten years old, resulting in the extinction of the species. To get Holly to help him, Artemis falsely accuses her of exposing his mother to magic, which led to her developing the disease. Holly believes Artemis and, ridden with guilt, accompanies him to the past to rescue the last lemur from his younger self. After several misadventures, Artemis recovers the lemur but learns that his mother's illness was a ruse plotted by Opal Koboi, who wanted the lemur's brain fluid to increase her own magical powers. Artemis ruins Opal's plans by bringing his ten-year-old self into the present and fooling Opal, saving his mother in the process. Opal flees, but returns again as Artemis appears to take the lemur and fly off the manor's grounds in his Cessna. She chases him, following the thermal read of the lemur and slowly destroying the plane until it crashes on the shoreline. At the crash site, the two stand off until she discovers that the lemur is actually only a decoy, fitted with a thermal read to trick Opal. Before she can further injure Artemis, he shoots the boulder she's on, and it is shown that it was in fact the shell of a kraken she stood on, built up with gases that exploded with the pressure of Artemis's shot. The LEP team later informs Artemis that Opal's body was not recovered from the rubble. As a result of Opal meddling with her mind, Angeline Fowl learns of Artemis' contact with the People, and she asks Artemis to tell her the truth. Artemis' 10-year-old self has his mind wiped by N¬∫1, but retains a brief memory of the existence of fairies,Eoin Colfer(2006). Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 125‚Äì128, 224‚Äì227, 373, 375, 384. . which spurs him to research them, ultimately leading to the events of the first book. In the seventh book, The Atlantis Complex, Artemis contracts a mental disease called Atlantis Complex disease, similar to OCD, and now has an alter- ego named Orion, who is in love with Holly Short, and has a strange fascination with bivouacking. Due to the disease, Artemis finds himself obsessed with the number 5 and fearing the number 4 (which in Chinese sounds like the word for death). The disease worsens throughout the novel, leading to his distrust of close friends. A neutrino shock from Holly Short frees Artemis' alter-ego Orion but he comes back after being knocked out by a buzz baton blow from Holly. He later undergoes Atlantis Complex Disease treatment by the fairies, curing him and restoring his former self. In the eighth book, The Last Guardian, Artemis must save humankind by stopping the crazed pixie Opal Koboi. Opal kills her younger self (who followed Artemis and Holly to the present in the sixth book) to gain enough black magic to open a magical gate, which has been under the Fowl Manor for a millennium, and so release the Berserkers (ancient fairy warriors). Then Artemis must fight his brothers, who have been taken over by the Berserker souls. He sacrifices himself at the conclusion of the book to trigger an ancient spell that disperses Opal and her various fairy spirits, but since his spirit was human (apart from some traces of fairy magic from Holly's borrowed eye), his essence endures at the location of the spell long enough for Holly and Foaly to clone a new body for him and transfer his soul into it. Although the process leaves him with missing memories, the book ends with Butler, Holly and Foaly immediately beginning work to restore them. In The Fowl Twins‚Äîthe first of a series of novels focusing on Artemis's younger twin brothers Beckett and Myles‚Äîit is mentioned that Artemis is currently six months into a five-year mission to Mars in a wind-up rocket he built in the family barn. He is accompanied by Butler, but has left his younger brothers Beckett and Myles under the 'guardianship' of NANNI, an artificial intelligence he created, whose voice and mannerisms were based on Holly Short. Holly herself has now been promoted to Commodore and appears at the end of the novel, the narrative observing that a combined grin and grimace is a traditional expression for anyone who spends prolonged time with the Fowls.  Characterization  = Family history = Artemis Fowl II is the son of Artemis Fowl I and Angeline Fowl. He is a brother to younger twins Beckett and Myles Fowl.Eoin Colfer (2008). Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 2. . As shown in the fifth and seventh book, Artemis' birthday is 1 September. The Fowls are a family of \\"legendary criminals\\" whose history dates back to at least the Norman Conquest that have amassed a fortune through both legitimate and illegitimate means. Working alongside the Fowls is the Butler family, a centuries-old line of trained bodyguards that form lifelong affiliations with members of the Fowl family.Eoin Colfer (2001). Artemis Fowl. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 15, 28. . The family motto is Aurum Est Potestas, (Gold is Power), which is written in Latin.Eoin Colfer (2003). Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 82. . Artemis Fowl I underwent reform following his kidnapping and has joined Angeline Fowl in her humanitarian and environmentalist efforts.Eoin Colfer (2008). Artemis Fowl: The Time Paradox. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 65. . = Physical appearance = Artemis is described as having pale skin, deep blue eyes, ruggedly handsome, premature wrinkling near the eyes, and raven black hair.Eoin Colfer (2001). Artemis Fowl. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 3, 71, 196. . He is said to resemble his father. As of his adventures in The Lost Colony, Artemis has exchanged one eye with Holly Short as a result of a botched re-materialization and now possesses one blue eye and one hazel eye, and a time travel in The Time Paradox aged him to his chronological age of 18 but then back again upon his return to his own time. A similar re-materialization resulted in the swapping of the index and second fingers on his left hand.Eoin Colfer (2006). Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 16, 300, 365. . His smile is called vampire-like, and he maintains manicured hands.Eoin Colfer (2002). Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 118. . Artemis has a slight build and is not physically fit.Eoin Colfer (2005). Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 185, 214. . He often wears Armani suits.Eoin Colfer (2003). Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 185. . It is also mentioned by himself that his first suit was a Zegna custom made as worn by Holly in The Time Paradox. As of The Last Guardian, Artemis has reverted to his image as it was at the start of the series due to being placed in a new body grown by Foaly when he lost his during Opal's attempt to dominate the world and wipe out the human race. He now possesses two blue eyes and all fingers are back in their original place. It is noted, however, that Artemis has the physical appearance of a boy just over the age of 15 and now also has six toes on one foot, shortly to be removed. = Personality = Colfer describes Artemis' personality at the beginning of the series as being difficult. A description of the twelve-year-old Artemis in The Artemis Fowl Files finds that \\"he may isolate himself completely from anyone wishing to be his friend and, ultimately, from his family too\\". However, Artemis also reveals in the same text that Butler is his best friend.Eoin Colfer (2004). The Artemis Fowl Files. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 85, 99. . Artemis later acknowledges his father, Holly, and Butler as figures of respect following the events of Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident.Eoin Colfer (2002). Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 277. . Following Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code, Holly Short and Foaly both express regret at Artemis' mindwipe.Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 303. . As the series progresses, Holly describes him as a friend. Artemis then acknowledges that he considers Holly, Julius Root, and Mulch Diggums to be friends as well. Artemis realizes that his adventures and new friendships have changed him for the better. Foaly later acknowledges Artemis as a friend of the People. Artemis admits feeling conflicted about wanting to be a criminal but also wanting to be a normal teen.Eoin Colfer (2005). Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 209, 233‚Äì234,253, 327, 332. . Ultimately, Artemis uses his abilities to help the People because he feels that he owes them for the past trouble he has caused, and he misses the challenges that their problems present.Eoin Colfer (2006). Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony. Artemis Fowl. Hyperion Books. pp. 95‚Äì96. . On the other hand, his 'alternate personality' (Orion) is almost the opposite. He is childish and possibly over-familiar, addressing Foaly as the 'noble steed' and treating Holly as his 'fair maiden'. His use of language is also very different, speaking as if he is a knight in a fantastical dragon-slaying story. Artemis hates lollipops, as well as other desserts. The intention of Artemis' development has been to explore the development of a \\"boy [that] becomes a young man and learns that avarice is not as important as family.\\" Colfer has noted that once Artemis \\"gets completely good, that's it\\" for his criminal ways. = Relationships = During The Lost Colony, Artemis meets a girl called Minerva Paradizo, another child prodigy aware of the existence of magic, and develops an apparent attraction to her, but this relationship is not fully explored before Artemis and Holly are transferred to the Lost Colony, where they remain for about three years, limiting Artemis's potential interest in getting back in contact with her. She is not mentioned in any of the other books. Artemis may have a possible romantic relationship with Holly Short. Though they start out as fierce enemies, they gradually learn to respect each other, and then to like each other. By the end of the fourth book they are good friends, and in the last book is described as having \\"tremendous affection for his fierce and beautiful best friend.\\" In The Time Paradox, the two kiss and seem to take pleasure in it, although Holly was suffering from somewhat disturbed hormones due to the time travel disrupting her body's chemistry. Also, in The Atlantis Complex, Artemis's alter ego, Orion, confesses his love to Holly and tries to woo her, although she is unnerved by his advances. In the last book, Artemis and Holly are in a crisis and Artemis finally realizes his affection for Holly and kisses her on the forehead which seems to be solely for romantic reasons, however, it is later revealed that this was also for the practical reason of allowing Foaly to have access to Artemis' DNA sample to create a clone and revive him. By the time of The Fowl Twins, Artemis has created an artificial intelligence named NANNI (Nano Artificial Neural Network Intelligence system) in Holly's image, who views the pair as her parents, while regularly communicating with Holly while on his mission to Mars alongside Butler. He obviously cares deeply for his mother, father, and brothers, and where they are concerned, acts much like a young boy who just wants to be taken care of by his parents. He also cares about Domovoi Butler very much, and has an ongoing rivalry with Foaly over who is more brilliant. He also has a pseudo-friendship with Mulch, and it is Mulch who eventually delivers the disk that helps him restore his memory after the events of The Eternity Code. Many details of Artemis's personal life are left open ended. As is stated in the first book, \\"[those questions] can only be answered by one person. And he delights in not talking.\\" = Aliases = Artemis also uses pseudonyms to hide his identity. Some names include a play on words, such as Dr. F. Roy Dean Schlippe (Freudian slip), Emmesey Squire (E=mc2), Dr. C. Niall DeMencha (senile dementia), and Sir E. Brum (cerebrum).Eoin Colfer (2002). Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident. Artemis Fowl.

Domovoi Butler usually adapts to the new identities by assuming the role of the father or guardian, including Constantin Bashkir and Colonel Xavier Lee.

He is also able to shoot Holly under circumstances which Holly (under the influence of a rune) claims Artemis would not.

He also considers his collection of Impressionist art to be the only material asset worth travelling in a time stream for. Artemis's exact cash worth is uncertain, but he is known to have stolen approximately $15 million worth of gold from the fairy ransom fund, in the original novel. In the third book, after Jon Spiro's attempt on his life, Artemis retaliated by completely draining his accounts. He donated the bulk of the money to Amnesty International, but chose to keep ten percent of it (about $300 million) for himself.

The series has received positive critical reception and generated huge sales. It has also originated graphic novel adaptations. A film adaptation based on the first novel was in the process of development by Disney since 2016, which was eventually released on the Disney+ streaming service on 12 June 2020. Series overview In the first book, Artemis Fowl, twelve-year-old genius Artemis Fowl. He and Butler, his servant, kidnap Holly Short, a Fairy and a captain of the Lower Elements Police Reconnaissance force (LEPRecon). He holds her for a ransom of gold to exploit the magical Fairy People and restore his family's fortune. In the sequel, Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident, he reluctantly allies with the People to rescue his father from the Russian mafia. The series introduces Artemis as a villain and the Fairies' enemy, but as the series progresses, Artemis's character develops and changes; as an antihero, he assists the People in resolving conflicts with worldwide ramifications. The original series concluded with Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian. =Main series= Artemis Fowl Artemis Fowl is the first book in the Artemis Fowl series. It follows the adventures of Artemis Fowl, a 12-year-old criminal mastermind, as he kidnaps a fairy for a large ransom of gold with the help of his bodyguard, Domovoi Butler, and his younger sister, Juliet Butler, to restore the Fowl family fortune. After multiple attempts by the Lower Elements Police (LEP) fairy police, including sending a criminal dwarf called Mulch Diggums, it concludes with Artemis finally releasing Holly Short, the elf fairy, whom he kidnapped, and having his mother cured of madness (in exchange for half of the gold that he had stolen from the fairies). Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident Artemis Fowl and the Arctic Incident is the second book of the series. It follows the rescue of Artemis's father Artemis Fowl I from the Russian Mafia, alongside the battle against the B'wa Kell goblin gang who have allied themselves with maniacal, evil genius Opal Koboi and officer Briar Cudgeon helping her out. Holly Short, an LEP captain; Julius Root, the LEP commander; and Foaly, a centaur and the main technology supervisor for the LEP, make an agreement with Artemis (after initially suspecting him to have orchestrated the events) to help them stop the goblin rebellion, with the help of Mulch Diggums half-way through. In the end, to fulfill their part of the agreement, they help Artemis find his father, who had been missing for 2 years. Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code Artemis Fowl and the Eternity Code covers Jon Spiro's theft of the fictional C Cube and its recovery. Jon Spiro is an American businessman, who has his bodyguard kill Butler and steals Artemis's C Cube, which is a handheld supercomputer that he made from stolen fairy technology. Butler, after dying (and being put into a fish freezer in an emergency attempt at cryonic preservation), is resurrected by the elf Holly Short. Mulch Diggums (under the pseudonym Mo Digence) is hired alongside Loafers McGuire by Spiro to kidnap Artemis to access the C Cube, which is encrypted by an Eternity Code only Artemis knows how to decrypt. Holly agrees to help, but with the condition that Artemis and his allies are to be mind-wiped. With the help of the dwarf and Butler's sister, Juliet, they raid Spiro Needle, the building housing Spiro's company, and retrieve the C Cube again. It ends with the fairies and Foaly mind-wiping the three humans, and Artemis gives Mulch Diggums a (supposed) medallion that Holly gave to Artemis in The Arctic Incident, while secretly being a disk that will bring back his memories of the fairies. Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception The fourth book, Artemis Fowl and the Opal Deception, covers power-hungry and insane pixie Opal Koboi's second attempt at world domination, after her first unfruitful attempt in the second novel. Koboi uses magic to persuade Giovanni Zito, a fictional environmentalist, to send a probe into the ground, which could lead to the uncovering of the fairy world, thrusting the fairy city of Haven into human clutches. In the process of stopping her, Commander Root is killed and the mind-wiped Artemis and Butler are saved from her bio-bomb. The two have their memories restored from the medallion, and Mulch, Artemis, Holly, and Butler stop Opal Koboi. Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony Artemis Fowl and the Lost Colony involves bringing the demon island Hydras back from \\"Limbo\\" with the help of N¬∞1, a powerful demon warlock. Artemis, Butler, Holly, Mulch, and Foaly reunite after Artemis encounters a demon from the island Hydras, and Holly and Mulch capture the pixie fish smuggler Doodah Day. Foaly tells them after the Battle of Taillte, the war for land against fairy and human, the demon fairy family sent themselves out of time on the island Hydras, and that on their island their time can be anything on ours. The time spell is crumbling, and demons are appearing on earth without warning. If the humans discover the demons, they will inevitably uncover the rest of the fairies. Artemis and his now friends go after the demon N¬∞1, who finds out that he is actually a demon warlock, and has extremely dangerous powers. N¬∞1 is kidnapped by child prodigy Minerva Paradizo, whom they encounter multiple times when trying to stop her research. Minerva intends to present N¬∞1 to humans to win the Nobel Prize. She eventually lets go of her project and joins them after Billy Kong, her security guard, \\"opens the Trojan Horse\\", also known as revealing the traitors he planted at the Paradise Chateau. Artemis, Holly, N¬∞1, and Qwan, a demon warlock that N¬∞1 frees from a gargoyle spell that turned him into stone, travel through time and space to Hydras, which Artemis had planned to get rid of with the live bomb Billy Kong had given Holly to annihilate the demons in Hydras, due to his belief that his brother was killed by a gang of demons. In Hydras, the pack leader Leon Abbot (N'Zall) and his army of demons fight Artemis and his friends. They knock Leon unconscious and create a bomb explosion powerful enough for them to use its energy ‚Äì converting it into magic, using Holly, N¬∞1, Qwan, and Leon Abbot's magic (which he gained from fusing with Qweffor, an apprentice warlock) and Artemis' stolen magic to send the island back to earth, where 3 years have passed because of the time spell. Artemis and Minerva are now noted to be very close in age. The book ends with Holly finding out that Mulch has recruited Doodah Day, and Artemis finds out that he is the brother of toddlers. Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox The sixth book of the series, Artemis Fowl and the Time Paradox, was released in the United Kingdom on 7 August 2008 and in the United States on 15 July 2008. Artemis's mother, Angeline Fowl, becomes ill with Spelltropy, and the only cure lies in the brain fluids of the silky sifaka lemur, the last of which Artemis sold to a group named the Extinctionists when he was 10 to procure money to fund the expedition to search for his father. N¬∞1 sends Artemis and Holly to the past, where Artemis must battle his former self to recover the last silky sakai lemur before the younger Artemis kills it in a business transaction with Damon Kronsky, the leader of the Extinctionists. Things get more complicated when Opal Koboi is revealed to be controlling the Extinctionists, feeding on the fluids of many extremely rare animals, to grant her special abilities and extraordinary prowess in certain fields. The chase finally leads to the two Artemises reaching an agreement, whereupon they are teleported to the future. Near to the ending, Opal is revealed to have possessed Angeline Fowl. Artemis Fowl and the Atlantis Complex Artemis contracts Atlantis Complex, a fairy condition resembling a combination of obsessive-compulsive disorder, extreme paranoia, and multiple personality disorder ‚Äì becoming the alter ego of Fowl, Orion, when the latter strikes. The story follows Turnball Root, the criminal brother of Julius Root, breaking out of jail and sending probes to destroy his enemies, including Artemis, his fairy friends, and Butler, whom Artemis sent away due to paranoia being one of the symptoms of Atlantis Complex. After Butler, Artemis, and his fairy friends reunite, along with being saved by Mulch Diggums from a gang of dwarfs sent by Turnball, they hunt down Turnball, tracking him with a computer orb connected to the probes that Artemis found underwater, along with being attacked by a giant, squid-like creature, and find out that Turnball has kidnapped demon warlock N¬∞1 to force him to reverse the aging of Turnball's wife, Leonor. In the end, Leonor and Turnball are killed in an explosion of a shuttle Leonor drives, to fulfill her last wish ‚Äì to fly once again ‚Äì and Artemis is sent to a fairy clinic to be cured of Atlantis Complex. Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian The final book of the original series, Artemis Fowl and the Last Guardian, was released on 10 July 2012. Opal Koboi opens the Berserker's Gate, a portal located on the Fowl Estate, in which dwell the spirits of fairy soldiers, the last victims of the Battle of Taillte, the final blow in the war that sent the Fairy People underground. Artemis, after his last session of being cured of Atlantis Complex, rushes to stop her along with Holly and Butler. They fail, and Opal opens the first gate, which releases the spirits of the warriors who begin to possess other people and animals around them, including corpses, animals, Juliet Butler, and Artemis's toddler brothers, Myles and Beckett. After escaping Opal and the possessed beings, they are helped by Mulch Diggums, and they attempt to stop Opal from opening the second gate, which destroys every human on the surface. While doing so, they (reluctantly) battle Artemis's possessed toddler brother Myles, who reveals to them Opal's plan after the fairy warrior spirit left his body. While they fight, Opal has also sent a dangerous fake present to Foaly's wife to make him suffer. Her plan fails because Caballine masters martial arts and Foaly comes to save her from goblins that Opal sent as well. Artemis and his friends fail to destroy the second gate with a laser he created, and Mulch saves them from possessed pirate corpses by riding the oldest troll in the world and knocking out most of them, causing the spirits of fairy warriors to leave their bodies to the afterlife. They then enter Fowl Manor where Artemis decides to sacrifice himself in order to stop Opal from opening the second gate. Foaly sends the clone of Opal that she created in the 4th book, and using her hand he is able to make the clone close the gates since the magic recognizes the clone's DNA as Opal's. Everyone in that area, including the spirits, immediately go to heaven, excluding Artemis, whose humanity and sheer willpower enables him to stay on Earth. Six months later, with the saliva that Artemis produced when he kissed Holly, they extract his DNA and make a clone of Artemis Fowl, which is then taken to the now overgrown gate. Artemis's spirit then takes control of the clone and he is alive once more. = The Fowl Twins = The series has been followed by a spin-off book series, called The Fowl Twins, which is centered around the characters of Myles and Beckett Fowl, Artemis Fowl's brothers. * The Fowl Twins is the first book in the series, and was released on 5 November 2019. * Deny All Charges will be the second book in the series, and is set to be released on 20 October 2020. = Other works = Artemis Fowl: The Seventh Dwarf is a short story written for World Book Day set between the first and second books.

The audiobooks were narrated by Nathaniel Parker. Adrian Dunbar and Enn Reitel narrated certain versions from different audiobook companies. Characters =Artemis Fowl= Artemis Fowl II uses his intelligence to build his family fortune through crime. This stems from his family, who have been criminals for generations. Artemis is cold, cynical, and often outright ruthless in his manipulation of people for his own ends. Following his father's presumed death at the hands of the Russian Mafia, and his mother's subsequent descent into madness, Artemis stopped attending his boarding school, assumed control of the Fowl criminal empire, and embarked on a crime spree to restore the family fortune and fund Arctic expeditions to rescue his father. His investigation into the supernatural eventually leads him into contact with the People in the first book. Due to a strict upbringing, and a lack of any intellectual equals to ground him, Artemis is socially awkward, his best friend and bodyguard Butler being one of the few individuals whom Artemis trusts. He is very pale with raven-black hair and blue eyes. In The Lost Colony, Holly Short and he switch eyes, leaving him with one blue eye and one hazel eye. Artemis is famed for his intelligence; he claims to have the \\"highest IQ tested in Europe\\", but is also known for a lack of coordination and athletic ability. Throughout the series, he learns profound morals from the Fairy People and becomes more compassionate and trustworthy, but still maintains much of his intelligence. Because of the time travel in The Lost Colony, his legal age is older than his real age. =Butler= Butler is the Fowl family's loyal manservant and Artemis's bodyguard, and accompanies him around the world on his adventures. He is the third-most skilled martial artist on the planet (the first is a monk on a Pacific Island and the second is his uncle), a formidable marksman and firearms expert, and has immense experience of the criminal underworld, often providing help to Artemis through his many contacts. His first name is Domovoi. He also has a little sister, Juliet, who appears in some of the books. Butler is rendered clinically dead temporarily in The Eternity Code, but is rescued by the ingenuity of his principal and the healing powers of Holly Short. Butler's favored weapon is a treasured Sig Sauer P226 pistol chambered in 9mm Parabellum, but often must resort to other fairy weaponry for his tasks. Due to his healing in The Eternity Code, his body is older than he actually is. =Holly Short= Holly is a determined, forthright elf and the only female captain of LEPrecon, the reconnaissance division of the LEP. Holly is three feet tall and slender, with nut-brown skin and auburn hair. In the first book, she is kidnapped by Artemis and held for ransom, but over the course of the series they slowly become friends. She helped Artemis save the world on numerous occasions, and is one of Artemis's few friends. Holly holds a disregard for the rules and orders given to her. She is also one of the best pilots in LEPrecon. =Foaly= Foaly is a centaur, technical genius, and computer geek. He works for the LEP, the fairy authorities, and is in charge of preventing humankind from discovering the fairy civilization. His intelligence makes him paranoiac, which causes him to wear a foil hat to \\"protect him from human mind-probing technology\\". He designs most of the weaponry, wings, and other technical gadgets that the LEP use, such as the 'Iris Cam'. His sarcasm and talkative nature often annoy LEP officers, though his greatest pleasure outside of his engineering is aggravating the notoriously bad-tempered Commander Root. He 'hitches' or marries a centaur named Caballine in The Lost Colony while Captain Short and Artemis are in Limbo, and apparently has foals. He has a rivalry with Opal Koboi, which she sporadically mentions throughout her dialogue. =Opal Koboi= Opal is a deranged, paranoid genius pixie whose dream is world domination and the destruction of the LEP. A prodigy, she built Koboi Laboratories, a technology company, which she used to crush her father's company out of spite. Opal is featured in several of the Artemis Fowl books as the main antagonist. She detests Foaly, as he won a science competition in college over her, and she believes the judges chose Foaly instead just because he was male. However, she became Artemis' archenemy after he and Holly foiled her plans numerous times. In The Opal Deception, she creates a clone of herself to escape imprisonment, later killing Julius Root rather violently with a bomb, and framing Holly Short. In the past, it is revealed that she harvested a silky silfaka lemur's brain fluid as one of the steps to achieving world domination. She later kills her past self created in The Time Paradox, creating a paradox. Opal is later killed by Oro Shaydova, the leader of fairy soldiers killed in the battle of Taillte. =Mulch Diggums= Mulch is a kleptomaniac, criminal dwarf who has been involved in crime for four centuries. When considered with the average dwarf lifespan, he is not that old. He once was a mining dwarf, but later decided that stealing from Mud Men (humans) suited him much better. Because he has stolen from Mud Men, Mulch no longer has the significant magic powers of the usual fairy, but he has retained the gift of tongues, and has even shown his ability to speak 'American dog' in The Arctic Incident. He insists that humans were stealing from fairy-kind and the earth and that he is simply taking them back or repossessing the items. In the early books, he assisted the LEP against Artemis Fowl, although later, he sides with Artemis Fowl. Eventually, when the fairies and Artemis are on stable ground, he joins forces with the Fairy People on many adventures, acting as an LEP helper at the beginning of The Time Paradox. =Julius Root= Julius Root commanded the LEPrecon and was in charge of all activities related to the tracking of those who leave fairy civilization, to prevent them making contact with humans. Known for his ruddy face (hence his nickname, \\"Beetroot\\") and extremely short temper, he led the LEPrecon on missions until Koboi killed him with an explosive in The Opal Deception and framed Holly Short. He usually despised Holly's disregard for rules and orders. However, Root also seems to have been a lot like Holly Short when he was younger; a book states that Holly Short had recently beat the speed record that had been set 80 years prior by Julius Root. Julius Root hates when Foaly called him by his first name. Julius Root also had a brother, Turnball Root, the main antagonist in The Atlantis Complex. =Briar Cudgeon= A minor antagonist in the first novel, Cudgeon was an ex-LEP lieutenant who was humiliated by Commander Julius Root and had the misfortune of having a terrible-looking face, the result of illegal mind-boosting liquid colliding with sedative Julius Root used to put him to sleep in the first novel. Looking for revenge, Cudgeon teams up with Opal Koboi in The Arctic Incident. Their plan suddenly goes wrong when LEP technical consultant Foaly inserts a video in Koboi Laboratories to expose to Briar Cudgeon's treacherous confessions to Foaly. Enraged by this, Opal attacks Cudgeon, and in the struggle, they smash into a pipeline containing reignited plasma, which violently fries Cudgeon to death, and gruesomely incapacitates Opal. Themes Colfer has said in interviews that the series is about Artemis growing up. Themes of greed, trust, and the difference between good and evil are also present in the books. Colfer wanted to end the series with a simple choice between being kind without reward or being unkind for a reward. Critical reception Colfer summed up the first book as \\"Die Hard with fairies.\\" Critics call the series \\"the new Harry Potter,\\" although Colfer stated in 2001 that he disagreed. Kate Kellaway of The Observer called the first book \\"a smart, amusing one-off. It flashes with hi-tech invention ‚Äì as if Colfer were as much an inspired boffin as a writer\\". Time magazine said of the book, \\"Artemis Fowl is pacy, playful, and very funny, an inventive mix of myth and modernity, magic and crime\\", while The New York Times Book Review said that \\"Colfer has done enormously, explosively well\\" in writing a book that could be accurately described as \\"Die Hard with fairies\\". The Guardian gave a favorable review to The Atlantis Complex, the seventh book in the series, but noted \\"it is also clearly a prelude to the grand finale.\\" The Last Guardian, the eighth and final novel of the series, received favorable reviews from Kirkus Reviews, Entertainment Weekly, and The Irish Times, also winning the 2012 Irish Book Award in the \\"Irish Children's Book ‚Äì Senior\\" category. In 2010 Artemis Fowl was selected by readers as the favorite Puffin Books title of all time, which Colfer described as his \\"proudest professional moment.\\" Film adaptation In 2001 plans were announced for a film adaptation of the series. Miramax Films was named as purchasing the film rights with Lawrence Guterman signed to direct. In 2003 Colfer stated that a screenplay had been finalized and that casting was due to start the same year but expressed skepticism over whether or not this would come to pass, though Colfer revealed the film was in pre-production. The film remained in development and was assumed to be in development hell until 2011, when it was reported that Jim Sheridan was interested in directing the movie, with Saoirse Ronan attached to portray Holly Short. In July 2013, Walt Disney Pictures announced that an Artemis Fowl film covering the events of the first and second novels of the series would be produced by Disney and The Weinstein Company, with the screenplay by Michael Goldenberg. Robert De Niro and Jane Rosenthal signed onto the project as executive producers. On 1 September 2015, Variety reported that Kenneth Branagh had been hired to direct the film for Disney, with Irish playwright Conor McPherson as screenwriter and Judy Hofflund as an executive producer. Eoin Colfer confirmed this in a video to Artemis Fowl Confidential, and spoke with RTE Radio 1 about meeting Branagh several times to discuss this prior to the announcement. On 12 September 2017, Disney announced that the film adaptation would be released on 9 August 2019. It was also announced to be based on the first two books in the series. It was announced on 11 October 2017 that Disney immediately removed Harvey Weinstein as the producer of the film as well as terminating its production with The Weinstein Company following a sexual misconduct controversy involving Weinstein. On 20 December 2017, it was announced that Irish newcomer Ferdia Shaw had been cast as Artemis Fowl II, alongside Judi Dench as Commander Root, Josh Gad as Mulch Diggums, Lara McDonnell as Captain Holly Short, and Nonso Anozie as Butler. Principal photography began in March 2018 with filming in England, Northern Ireland, and Ho Chi Minh City. On 7 May 2019, the film's originally scheduled release date of 9 August 2019 was delayed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures to 29 May 2020, as part of a change to their release schedule, while Colin Farrell was announced to be portraying Artemis Fowl I. The film was pulled completely on 3 April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and instead debuted on Disney+, 12 June 2020. Upon the film's release, the film was criticised for the removal of the character arcs of both Artemis Fowl II and Holly Short from the book series in the film, with Fowl switched from antagonist to protagonist, and Short being relegated from protagonist to supporting character. McDonnell's casting was also criticised as whitewashing due to Short being physically described in the book series as having nut-brown skin of a coffee complexion. The casting of Nonso Anozie as Butler was also criticised for several reasons: that the character is described as Eurasian who can pass as Japanese and Russian in the book series, and that the character's physical description of terrifying anyone in his presence, combined with his backstory of his family having served the Fowl family for centuries and Anozie's casting, embodies several stereotypes of African Americans, in particular the \\"scary black man\\" and \\"black servant\\" tropes. Terms and slangs In the books, several terms and fairy slang are used. = Mud People = This term (also Mud Men, Mud Boy, Mud Girl, Mud Maid, Mud Woman, Mud Wench, etc.) is used to refer to humans. Fairies already had advanced technology when humans first existed. According to the fairies, humans first crawled in mud, hence the term Mud People. = The People = The People (also known as fairies) are a group of creatures that include Centaurs, Demons, Dwarves, Elves, Gnomes, Goblin, Pixies, Jumbo Pixies, Sprites, and Water Sprites. = D'Arvit = D'Arvit is a curse word in the fictional language of Gnommish. It appeared in the first book. The word was said to have no need to be translated, as it would be censored anyway. Readers have translated D'Arvit as the expletive 'shit', though the original word itself is more widely accepted. Its usage in the books suggests a similar meaning, expressing extreme frustration or anger.

Life Born in Rome, she was the daughter and heiress of Jean de Vivonne, marquis of Pisani, and Giulia Savelli, who belonged to a noble Roman family. She was married at the age of twelve to Charles d'Angennes, vidame du Mans, and in 1612, marquis de Rambouillet. They had seven children, two sons and five daughters.G. Lenotre, Le Ch√¢teau de Rambouillet, six si√®cles d'histoire, chapter: Les Pr√©cieuses, Deno√´l, Paris, 1984, p. 19. The young, beautiful and witty marquise found the coarseness and intrigues of the French court little to her taste and, in 1620, she began to gather around her the circle that gave its renown to her salon. She and her husband had taken residence in Paris at the H√¥tel Pisani, later renamed H√¥tel de Rambouillet, and which she restored between 1618 and 1620. It was situated rue Saint-Thomas-du-Louvre, between the Louvre and the Tuileries.Map of Paris by N. de Fer, dated 1705, on which the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre, which disappeared in the mid-19th century, can be seen between the Louvre and the Tuileries: :fr:Fichier:Plan de Paris 1705 BNF07710700.png The former H√¥tel de Rambouillet, which belonged to the d'Angennes family, was located rue Saint-Honor√© and was sold in 1602 by her father-in-law, Nicolas d'Angennes. In 1624, it was bought by Cardinal Richelieu who had it demolished, and who built on its site his Palais Cardinal, future Palais Royal. Madame de Rambouillet arranged the former H√¥tel Pisani for the purpose of receiving her guests, and devised suites of small rooms where guests could move around and find more privacy than in the large reception rooms. She received her visitors in the chambre bleue, a salon painted in blue and with blue heavy brocade wall hangings.Tallemant des R√©aux Historiettes, chapter Madame de Rambouillet, \\"M√©moires\\" reviewed by MM. Monmerqu√© & Paulin, (3rd edition), published by J. Techener, Libraire, Paris, 1862, tome 2, p. 262.Inventaires de l'h√¥tel de Rambouillet √† Paris en 1652, 1666 et 1671, du ch√¢teau de Rambouillet en 1666 et des ch√¢teaux d'Angoul√™me et de Montauriser en 1671, publi√©s par Charles Sauz√©, Magistrat, pour la Soci√©t√© arch√©ologique de Rambouillet, avec une Pr√©face de F. Lorin, Secr√©taire de cette Soci√©t√©, N¬∞ XX de ses Publications, Tours, Imprimerie Deslis Fr√®res, 6 rue Gambetta, 1894, p. 39 The H√¥tel de Rambouillet maintained its importance as a literary salon until the mid-17th century: the beginning of its decline was in 1645, year of the marriage of Julie and of the death of the 30-year-old marquis de Pisani, son of the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet; it continued in 1648, which saw the beginning of the Fronde and the death of Vincent Voiture, l'√¢me du rond (\\"the soul of the circle\\"), and was accelerated in 1652, at the death of the marquis de Rambouillet. Almost all major personages of the French aristocracy and literature of the time frequented it, and its reputation was at its height in the second quarter of the century. Occasionally, in spring and summer, the marquis and marquise de Rambouillet would entertain the habitu√©s of their Parisian residence in the ch√¢teau de Rambouillet and its beautiful park.Tallemant des R√©aux, p. 265G. Lenotre, pp. 24-25. Her success as a literary hostess (the term salonni√®re did not appear before the 19th century) has many explanations. Her natural abilities had been carefully trained. The marquise had a genuine kindness and a lack of prejudice that enabled her to entertain princes and princesses of the blood royal and literary men with the same grace, whilst among her intimate friends was the beautiful actress Ang√©lique Paulet. The respect paid to ability in the salon effected a great advancement in the position of French men of letters. Moreover, the almost uniform excellence of the memoirs and letters of 17th century French men and women may be traced largely to the development of conversation as a fine art at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet, and the consequent establishment of a standard of clear and adequate expression. Mme de Rambouillet was known as the \\"incomparable Arth√©nice\\", the name being an anagram for \\"Catherine\\", devised by Fran√ßois de Malherbe and Racan. Among the more noteworthy episodes in the history of the H√¥tel de Rambouillet are the literary quarrel between the Uranistes and the Jobelins - respective partisans of two famous sonnets, the Sonnet d'Uranie, by Vincent Voiture, and the Sonnet de Job, by Isaac de Benserade - and the composition by almost all the great poets of the day of the Guirlande de Julie, a collection of forty-one madrigals, each on the theme of a flower, offered in 1641 to Julie d'Angennes by Charles de Sainte Maure, who had been wooing her for ten years when he conceived the idea of the handsome manuscript, but whom she kept waiting four more years. Julie herself, the H√¥tel de Rambouillet Princesse Julie, was responsible for a good deal of the preciosity for which the Pr√©cieuses were later ridiculed by Moli√®re. The Pr√©cieuses, who are usually associated with Moli√®re's avowed caricatures and with the extravagances of Mlle de Scud√©ry, but a name Madame de S√©vign√© herself was proud to bear, insisted on a ceremonious gallantry from their suitors and friends, though it seems from the account given by Tallemant des R√©aux that mild practical jokes took place at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet. They especially favoured an elaborate and quintessenced kind of colloquial and literary expression, imitated from Giambattista Marini and Lu√≠s de G√≥ngora y Argote, then fashionable throughout Europe. Moli√®re's immortal Pr√©cieuses ridicules was no doubt directly levelled not at the H√¥tel de Rambouillet itself, but at the numerous coteries which in the course of years had sprung up in imitation of it. The satire affected the originators as well as the imitators, the former more closely perhaps than they perceived. The H√¥tel de Rambouillet remained in existence until the death of its hostess, although the troubles of the Fronde diminished its influence. The chief original authorities respecting Madame de Rambouillet and her set are Tallemant des R√©aux in his Historiettes, and Antoine Baudeau de Somaize in his Grand Dictionnaire des Pr√©cieuses (1660). 1705 Map of Paris by N. de Fer, showing the rue Saint-Thomas du Louvre between the Louvre and the Tuileries.

The film, a romantic comedy, was filmed on location in Ireland over the next three weeks by the participants on the Filmbase/Staffordshire University MSc in Digital Feature Film Production. The film premiered at the 26th Galway Film Fleadh on 11 July 2014. The film is an eco friendly production. John Gormley, the former Green Party Minister, has been appointed as a Green Production Manager for the production, with a view to minimising the carbon footprint and environmental impact of the film. On 1 September 2015, Variety reported that Kenneth Branagh had been hired to direct Artemis Fowl for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures, with Irish playwright Conor McPherson as screenwriter and Judy Hofflund and Branagh as producers. Colfer confirmed this in a video to Artemis Fowl Confidential, and spoke with RTE Radio 1 about meeting Branagh several times to discuss the film prior to the announcement. The film was originally scheduled for release on August 9, 2019, but on May 7, 2019, it was delayed to May 29, 2020. The film was pulled on April 3, 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and debuted on Disney+ on June 12, 2020 instead of a theatrical release, to overwhelmingly negative reviews. =Theatre= Colfer wrote an extended monologue for the Wexford Arts Centre in 2015, before expanding the piece into a full play.https://www.irishexaminer.com/lifestyle/artsfilmtv/theatre-review-my- real-life-at-theatre-royal-waterford-411264.html My Real Life was originally performed across Ireland and the UK throughout 2016 and 2017, before coming to the Edinburgh Festival Fringe in 2017.

The only entirely postgraduate art and design university in the United Kingdom. It offers postgraduate degrees in art and design to students from over 60 countries. History The Darwin Building in Kensington Gore The RCA was founded in Somerset House in 1837 as the Government School of Design or Metropolitan School of Design. Richard Burchett became head of the school in 1852. In 1853 it was expanded and moved to Marlborough House, and then, in 1853 or 1857, to South Kensington, on the same site as the South Kensington Museum. It was renamed the Normal Training School of Art in 1857 and the National Art Training School in 1863. During the later 19th century it was primarily a teacher training college; pupils during this period included George Clausen, Christopher Dresser, Luke Fildes, Kate Greenaway and Gertrude Jekyll. In 1896 or 1897 the school received the name Royal College of Art, and the emphasis of teaching there shifted to the practice of art and design. Teaching of graphic design, industrial design and product design began in the mid-twentieth century. The school expanded further in the 1960s, and in 1967 it received a Royal Charter which gave it the status of an independent university with the power to grant its own degrees. In July 2020, the Royal College of Art launched its first-ever online graduate exhibition, RCA2020. Campuses The RCA has three campuses, in South Kensington, Battersea and White City. The Darwin Building in Kensington Gore dates from the 1960s and is a Grade II listed building. It was designed by a team of RCA staff members, H. T. Cadbury-Brown, Hugh Casson and Robert Goodden. In 1991 the sculpture department moved to a converted factory across the river Thames in Battersea. In the early 2000s the college conceived a substantial second campus being created on the site, with a minibus service linking it to Kensington. Thus, after a successful redevelopment of the premises by Wright & Wright (budget ¬£4.3m, floor area 2,500 sq m), the present Sculpture Building opened in January 2009. A masterplan was commissioned by Haworth Tompkins and phase 1 of their three-phase design was completed with the opening of the Sackler Building on 19 November 2009, to house the painting department. Its name commemorates a major gift by The Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. Entrance from Jay Mews The Dyson Building, named in honour of James Dyson, whose educational charity donated ¬£5m to the development, was opened on 24 September 2012. It is the home for printmaking and photography, and contains an innovation wing where start-up designers can launch their businesses. The Woo Building was opened on 30 September 2015, completing the Battersea project. It is named in honour of Sir Po-Shing and Lady Helen Woo, who have funded scholarships at the RCA since the 1990s. It accommodates the Ceramics & Glass and Jewellery & Metal programmes. The building's anodised aluminium gates were designed by alumnus Max Lamb. Courses The RCA offers a Graduate Diploma pre-masters conversion programme, MA, MRes, MPhil and PhD degrees in twenty-eight subject areas, divided into four schools: architecture, arts & humanities, communication, and design. The history of design programme is in collaboration with the Victoria and Albert Museum; there are two double MA/MSc programmes with Imperial College London. In addition to formal qualifications the RCA also offers Summer school and Executive education courses throughout the year. English for academic purposes (EAP) courses are offered to applicants who need to improve their academic English ability to meet the College's entry requirements. In early 2019, the RCA announced the launch of its new GenerationRCA programme. GenerationRCA -among other initiatives- will also \\"inject science disciplines into the mix of creative disciplines traditionally on offer.\\" The new programmes will include Environmental Architecture and Digital Direction; with future programmes centred on nano and soft robotics, computer science, and machine learning, material science and the circular economy. Rankings In 2020, the RCA was placed first in the art and design subject area in the QS World University Rankings published by Quacquarelli Symonds for the sixth year in a row, with an overall score of 98.9/100. In August 2015 it was ranked first on a list of master's courses in fashion by Business of Fashion, a fashion website. In April 2011 the RCA was ranked first on a list of UK graduate art schools compiled by Modern Painters magazine from a survey of professionals in the art world. In the Research Assessment Exercise of December 2008, 40% of the research output of the school received the highest (4* or \\"world-leading\\") assessment, the third-highest rating in the art and design subject area; over all subject areas only about fifty institutions received a higher rating. Alumni The Royal College of Art and its predecessor schools have numerous notable alumni in many fields. Among those who studied in the predecessor schools in the nineteenth century were Sir George Clausen, Christopher Dresser, Sir Luke Fildes, Kate Greenaway, Gertrude Jekyll and Edwin Lutyens. Alumni from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries include the sculptors Barbara Hepworth and Henry Moore, painters Frank Auerbach, David Hockney, Bridget Riley, Sir Peter Blake and Charles Tunnicliffe, artists Jake and Dinos Chapman, Tracey Emin and R. B. Kitaj, fashion designers Ossie Clark and Zandra Rhodes, industrial designers James Dyson and David Mellor, film directors Tony and Ridley Scott, writer Travis Jeppesen, designers Thomas Heatherwick and Sir David Adjaye, prominent member of the suffragette movement Sylvia Pankhurst, the musician Ian Dury and the actor Alan Rickman.

It provides military engineering and other technical support to the British Armed Forces and is headed by the Chief Royal Engineer. The Regimental Headquarters and the Royal School of Military Engineering are in Chatham in Kent, England. The corps is divided into several regiments, barracked at various places in the United Kingdom and around the world. History Royal Engineers recruitment posterCorps of Royal Engineers Cypher The Royal Engineers trace their origins back to the military engineers brought to England by William the Conqueror, specifically Bishop Gundulf of Rochester Cathedral, and claim over 900 years of unbroken service to the crown. Engineers have always served in the armies of the Crown; however, the origins of the modern corps, along with those of the Royal Artillery, lie in the Board of Ordnance established in the 15th century. In Woolwich in 1716, the Board formed the Royal Regiment of Artillery and established a Corps of Engineers, consisting entirely of commissioned officers. The manual work was done by the Artificer Companies, made up of contracted civilian artisans and labourers. In 1772, a Soldier Artificer Company was established for service in Gibraltar, the first instance of non- commissioned military engineers. In 1787, the Corps of Engineers was granted the Royal prefix, and adopted its current name; in the same year, a Corps of Royal Military Artificers was formed, consisting of non-commissioned officers and privates, to be led by the Royal Engineers. Ten years later, the Gibraltar company (which had remained separate) was absorbed, and in 1812 the unit's name was changed to the Corps of Royal Sappers and Miners. The Corps has no battle honours. In 1832, the regimental motto, Ubique & Quo Fas Et Gloria Ducunt (\\"Everywhere\\" & \\"Where Right And Glory Lead\\"; in Latin fas implies \\"sacred duty\\") was granted. The motto signified that the Corps had seen action in all the major conflicts of the British Army and almost all of the minor ones as well.British Army Website: Corps of Royal Engineers Badges and Emblems Anon (1916) Regimental Nicknames and Traditions of the British Army. 5th Ed. London: Gale and Polden Ltd. p. 36 In 1855, the Board of Ordnance was abolished, and authority over the Royal Engineers, Royal Sappers and Miners and Royal Artillery was transferred to the Commander-in-Chief of the Forces, thus uniting them with the rest of the Army. The following year, the Royal Engineers and Royal Sappers and Miners became a unified corps as the Corps of Royal Engineers, and their headquarters were moved from the Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, to Chatham, Kent. The re-organisation of the British military that began in the mid-Nineteenth Century and stretched over several decades included the reconstitution of the Militia, the raising of the Volunteer Force, and the ever-closer organisation of the part-time forces with the regular army.War Office Circular, 12 May 1859, published in The Times, 13 May. The old Militia had been an infantry force, other than the occasional employment of Militiamen to man artillery defences and other roles on an emergency basis. This changed in 1861, with the conversion of some units to artillery roles. Militia and Volunteer Engineering companies were also created, beginning with the conversion of the militia of Anglesey and Monmouthshire to engineers in 1877. The Militia and Volunteer Force engineers supported the regular Royal Engineers in a variety of roles, including operating the boats required to tend the submarine mine defences that protected harbours in Britain and its empire. These included a submarine mining militia company that was authorised for Bermuda in 1892, but never raised, and the Bermuda Volunteer Engineers that wore Royal Engineers uniforms and replaced the regular Royal Engineers companies withdrawn from the Bermuda Garrison in 1928.Army Notes. Royal United Services Institution Journal, Volume 73, Issue 490, 1928UK Parliament house of commons debate: ARMY ESTIMATES, 1928. 8 March 1928. vol 214 cc1261-310 1261 The various part-time reserve forces were amalgamated into the Territorial Force in 1908,Tony Mason and Eliza Ried, Sport and the Military: The British Armed Forces 1880‚Äì1960 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press) p.39 which was retitled the Territorial Army after the First World War, and the Army Reserve in 2014. In 1911 the Corps formed its Air Battalion, the first flying unit of the British Armed Forces. The Air Battalion was the forerunner of the Royal Flying Corps and Royal Air Force. The First World War saw a rapid transformation of the Royal Engineers as new technologies became ever more important in the conduct of warfare and engineers undertook an increasing range of roles. In the front line they designed and built fortifications, operated poison gas equipment, repaired guns and heavy equipment, and conducted underground warfare beneath enemy trenches. Support roles included the construction, maintenance and operation railways, bridges, water supply and inland waterways, as well as telephone, wireless and other communications. As demands on the Corps increased, its manpower was expanded from a total (including reserves) of about 25,000 in August 1914, to 315,000 in 1918. In 1915, in response to German mining of British trenches under the then static siege conditions of the First World War, the corps formed its own tunnelling companies. Manned by experienced coal miners from across the country, they operated with great success until 1917, when after the fixed positions broke, they built deep dugouts such as the Vampire dugout to protect troops from heavy shelling. Before the Second World War, Royal Engineers recruits were required to be at least 5 feet 4 inches tall (5 feet 2 inches for the Mounted Branch). They initially enlisted for six years with the colours and a further six years with the reserve or four years and eight years. Unlike most corps and regiments, in which the upper age limit was 25, men could enlist in the Royal Engineers up to 35 years of age. They trained at the Royal Engineers Depot in Chatham or the Royal Engineer Mounted Depot at Aldershot.War Office, His Majesty's Army, 1938 During the 1980s, the Royal Engineers formed the vital component of at least three Engineer Brigades: 12 Engineer Brigade (Airfield Damage Repair); 29th Engineer Brigade; and 30th Engineer Brigade.Isby and Kamps, Armies of NATO's Central Front. After the Falklands War, 37 (FI) Engineer Regiment was active from August 1982 until 14 March 1985.RE Journal, Vol 99, No. 3, p.141 Regimental museum The Royal Engineers Museum is in Gillingham in Kent. Significant constructions Britain having acquired an Empire, it fell to the Royal Engineers to conduct some of the most significant \\"civil\\" engineering schemes around the world. Some examples of great works of the era of empire can be found in A. J. Smithers's book Honourable Conquests. =British Columbia= The Royal Engineers, Columbia Detachment, commanded by Richard Clement Moody, was responsible for the foundation and settlement of British Columbia as the Colony of British Columbia. =Royal Albert Hall= The Royal Albert Hall, designed by Captain Francis Fowke RE The Royal Albert Hall is one of the UK's most treasured and distinctive buildings, recognisable the world over. Since its opening by Queen Victoria in 1871, the world's leading artists from every kind of performance genre have appeared on its stage. Each year it hosts more than 350 performances including classical concerts, rock and pop, ballet and opera, tennis, award ceremonies, school and community events, charity performances and lavish banquets. The Hall was designed by Captain Francis Fowke and Major-General Henry Y. D. Scott of the Royal Engineers and built by Lucas Brothers. The designers were heavily influenced by ancient amphitheatres, but had also been exposed to the ideas of Gottfried Semper while he was working at the Victoria and Albert Museum. =Indian infrastructure= Much of the British colonial era infrastructure of India, of which elements survive today, was created by engineers of the three presidencies' armies and the Royal Engineers. Lieutenant (later General Sir) Arthur Thomas Cotton (1803‚Äì99), Madras Engineers, was responsible for the design and construction of the great irrigation works on the river Cauvery, which watered the rice crops of Tanjore and Trichinopoly districts in the late 1820s. In 1838 he designed and built sea defences for Vizagapatam. He masterminded the Godavery Delta project where of land were irrigated and of land to the port of Cocanada was made navigable in the 1840s. Such regard for his lasting legacy was shown when in 1983, the Indian Government erected a statue in his memory at Dowleswaram. Other irrigation and canal projects included the Ganges Canal, where Colonel Sir Colin Scott-Moncrieff (1836‚Äì1916) acted as the Chief Engineer and made modifications to the original work. Among other engineers trained in India, Scott-Moncrieff went on to become Under Secretary of State Public Works, Egypt where he restored the Nile barrage and irrigation works of Lower Egypt. =Rideau Canal= The construction of the Rideau Canal was proposed shortly after the War of 1812, when there remained a persistent threat of attack by the United States on the British colony of Upper Canada. The initial purpose of the Rideau Canal was military, as it was intended to provide a secure supply and communications route between Montreal and the British naval base in Kingston, Ontario. Westward from Montreal, travel would proceed along the Ottawa River to Bytown (now Ottawa), then southwest via the canal to Kingston and out into Lake Ontario. The objective was to bypass the stretch of the St. Lawrence River bordering New York State, a route which would have left British supply ships vulnerable to attack or a blockade of the St. Lawrence. The construction of the canal was supervised by Lieutenant-Colonel John By of the Royal Engineers. In 2007 it was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site recognizing it as a work of human creative genius. The Rideau Canal was recognized as the best preserved example of a slack water canal in North America demonstrating the use of European slackwater technology in North America on a large scale. Lt. Denison was one of the junior Royal Engineers who worked under Lt. Colonel John By, RE on the Rideau Canal in Upper Canada (1826‚Äì1832). Of note, Denison carried out experiments under the direction of Lt. Col. By to determine the strength, for construction purposes of the old growth timber in the vicinity of Bytown. His findings were published by the Institution of Civil Engineers in England who bestowed upon him the prestigious Telford Medal. =Dover's Western Heights= Drop Redoubt. The Western Heights of Dover are one of the most impressive fortifications in Britain. They comprise a series of forts, strong points and ditches, designed to protect the United Kingdom from invasion. They were created to augment the existing defences and protect the key port of Dover from both seaward and landward attack. First given earthworks in 1779 against the planned invasion that year, the high ground west of Dover, England, now called Dover Western Heights, was properly fortified in 1804 when Lieutenant- Colonel William Twiss was instructed to modernise the existing defences. This was part of a huge programme of fortification in response to Napoleon's planned invasion of the United Kingdom. To assist with the movement of troops between Dover Castle and the town defences Twiss made his case for building the Grand Shaft in the cliff: > \\"... the new barracks. ... are little more than 300 yards horizontally from > the beach. ... and about above high-water mark, but in order to communicate > with them from the centre of town, on horseback the distance is nearly a > mile and a half and to walk it about three-quarters of a mile, and all the > roads unavoidably pass over ground more than above the barracks, besides the > footpaths are so steep and chalky that a number of accidents will > unavoidably happen during the wet weather and more especially after floods. > I am therefore induced to recommend the construction of a shaft, with a > triple staircase ... the chief objective of which is the convenience and > safety of troops ... and may eventually be useful in sending reinforcements > to troops or in affording them a secure retreat.\\" Twiss's plan was approved and building went ahead. The shaft was to be in diameter, deep with a gallery connecting the bottom of the shaft to Snargate Street, and all for under an estimated ¬£4000. The plan entailed building two brick-lined shafts, one inside the other. In the outer would be built a triple staircase, the inner acting as a light well with \\"windows\\" cut in its outer wall to illuminate the staircases. Apparently, by March 1805 only of the connecting gallery was left to dig and it is probable that the project was completed by 1807. =Pentonville Prison= Pentonville Prison designed by Capt Joshua Jebb RE Two Acts of Parliament allowed for the building of Pentonville Prison for the detention of convicts sentenced to imprisonment or awaiting transportation. Construction started on 10 April 1840 and was completed in 1842. The cost was ¬£84,186 12s 2d. Captain (later Major General Sir) Joshua Jebb designed Pentonville Prison, introducing new concepts such as single cells with good heating, ventilation and sanitation. =Boundary Commissions= Although mapping by what became the Ordnance Survey was born out of military necessity it was soon realised that accurate maps could be also used for civil purposes. The lessons learnt from this first boundary commission were put to good use around the world where members of the Corps have determined boundaries on behalf of the British as well as foreign governments; some notable boundary commissions include: *1839 ‚Äì Canada-United States *1858 ‚Äì Canada-United States (Captain (later General Sir) John Hawkins RE) *1856 and 1857 ‚Äì Russo-Turkish (Lieutenant Colonel (later Sir) Edward Stanton RE) *1857 ‚Äì Russo-Turkish (Colonel (later Field Marshal Sir) Lintorn Simmons RE) *1878 ‚Äì Bulgarian *1880 ‚Äì Gr√¶co-Turkish (Major (later Major General Sir) John Ardagh RE) *1884 ‚Äì Russo-Afghan (Captain (later Colonel Sir) Thomas Holdich RE) *1894 ‚Äì India-Afghanistan (Captain (later Colonel Sir) Thomas Holdich RE) *1902 ‚Äì Chile-Argentine (Colonel Sir Delme Radcliffe RE) *1911 ‚Äì Peru-Bolivia (Major A. J. Woodroffe RE) Much of this work continues to this day. The reform of the voting franchise brought about by the Reform Act (1832), demanded that boundary commissions were set up. Lieutenants Dawson and Thomas Drummond (1797‚Äì1839), Royal Engineers, were employed to gather the statistical information upon which the Bill was founded, as well as determining the boundaries and districts of boroughs. It was said that the fate of numerous boroughs fell victim to the heliostat and the Drummond light, the instrument that Drummond invented whilst surveying in Ireland. =Abney Level= An Abney level is an instrument used in surveying which consists of a fixed sighting tube, a movable spirit level that is connected to a pointing arm, and a protractor scale. The Abney level is an easy to use, relatively inexpensive, and when used correctly an accurate surveying tool. The Abney level was invented by Sir William de Wiveleslie Abney (1843‚Äì1920) who was a Royal Engineer, an English astronomer and chemist best known for his pioneering of colour photography and colour vision. Abney invented this instrument under the employment of the Royal School of Military Engineering in Chatham, England, in the 1870s. =H.M. Dockyards= In 1873, Captain Henry Brandreth RE was appointed Director of the Department of Architecture and Civil Engineering, later the Admiralty Works Department. Following this appointment many Royal Engineer officers superintended engineering works at Royal Navy Dockyards in various parts of the world, including the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda. 1848 Woodcut of HMD Bermuda, Ireland Island, Bermuda. Chatham Dockyard Slip 7 at Chatham Dockyard, designed by Col. G. Greene RE Slip 3 at Chatham Dockyard, designed and built by the Corps Chatham, being the home of the Corps, meant that the Royal Engineers and the Dockyard had a close relationship since Captain Brandreth's appointment. At the Chatham Dockyard, Captain Thomas Mould RE designed the iron roof trusses for the covered slips, 4, 5 and 6. Slip 7 was designed by Colonel Godfrey Greene RE on his move to the Corps from the Bengal Sappers & Miners. In 1886 Major Henry Pilkington RE was appointed Superintendent of Engineering at the Dockyard, moving on to Director of Engineering at the Admiralty in 1890 and Engineer-in-Chief of Naval Loan Works, where he was responsible for the extension of all major Dockyards at home and abroad. Trades ME ‚Äì Fabricator in Iraq AVRE in Canada All members of the Royal Engineers are trained combat engineers and all sappers (privates) and non-commissioned officers also have another trade.

The Royal School of Military Engineering (RSME) is the British Army's Centre of Excellence for Military Engineering, Explosive Ordnance Disposal (EOD), and counter terrorist search training. Located on several sites in Chatham, Kent, Camberley in Surrey and Bicester in Oxfordshire the Royal School of Military Engineering offers training facilities for the full range of Royal Engineer skills. The RSME was founded by Major (later General Sir) Charles Pasley, as the Royal Engineer Establishment in 1812.Corps History Part 6 Royal Engineers Museum It was renamed the School of Military Engineering in 1868 and granted the \\"Royal\\" prefix in 1962.Corps History Part 17 Royal Engineers Museum * Royal School of Military Engineering ** Combat Engineer School *** 3 Royal School of Military Engineering Regiment, in Minley: **** 55 Training Squadron **** 57 Training Squadron **** 63 Headquarters and Training Support Squadron *** Communication Information Systems Wing ** Construction Engineer School *** 1 Royal School of Military Engineering Regiment, in Chatham: **** 24 Training Squadron **** 36 Training Squadron **** Boat Operations **** Hackett Troop (Plant) *** Civil Engineering Wing *** Electrical and Mechanical Wing ** Royal Engineers Warfare Wing (Founded in 2011 and split between Brompton Barracks, Chatham and Gibraltar Barracks at Minley in Hampshire, this is the product of the amalgamation between Command Wing, where Command and Tactics were taught and Battlefield Engineering Wing, where combat engineering training was facilitated.) *** United Kingdom Mine Information and Training Centre ** Defence Explosive Munitions and Search School (formally Defence EOD School and the National Search Centre) * 28 Training Squadron, Army Training Regiment * Diving Training Unit (Army), (DTU(A)) * Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers (The band are part of the Corps of Army Music, but wear the uniform of the Royal Engineers) Corps' Ensign Camp Gate Flag of the Royal Engineers Royal Engineers' Ensign The Royal Engineers, Ports Section, operated harbours and ports for the army and used mainly specialised vessels such as tugs and dredgers.

Rochester Cathedral from the West Bishop Gundulf, a monk from the Abbey of Bec in Normandy came to England in 1070 as Archbishop Lafranc's assistant at Canterbury. His talent for architecture had been spotted by King William I and was put to good use in Rochester, where he was sent as bishop in 1077. Almost immediately the King appointed him to supervise the construction of the White Tower, now part of the Tower of London in 1078. Under William Rufus he also undertook building work on Rochester Castle. Having served three kings of England and earning \\"the favour of them all\\", Gundulf is accepted as the first \\"King's Engineer\\". Corps Band Musicians from the Band of the Corps of Royal Engineers during a Medals Parade for 32 Engineer Regiment. The Band of the Corps of the Royal Engineers is the official military band of the RE. The RE Symphony Orchestra was founded in 1880. It was recognised by Queen Victoria seven year later, with her command that they perform at Buckingham Palace for a banquet on the occasion of her Diamond Jubilee. In 1916-1917, the band toured France and Belgium, giving over one hundred and fifty concerts in a journey of 1800 miles. The band continued its tour of Europe following the cessation of hostilities. In 1936, the band performed at the funeral of George V and played the following year for the Coronation of George VI in 1937. The band appeared at the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II in 1953, and has since been called on to play at state occasions, military tattoos and military parades. It has notably performed during the opening ceremonies of the Channel Tunnel and the Queen Elizabeth II Bridge. The band is today one of the premier bands in the Corps of Army Music. The Institution of Royal Engineers The Ravelin Building at the Royal School of Military Engineering, Chatham, is now home to the Institution and the Corps Museum. The Institution of Royal Engineers, the professional institution of the Corps of Royal Engineers, was established in 1875 and in 1923 it was granted its Royal Charter by King George V. The Institution is collocated with the Royal Engineers Museum, within the grounds of the Royal School of Military Engineering at Brompton in Chatham, Kent. The History of the Corps of Royal Engineers is currently in its 12th volume. The first two volumes were written by Major General Whitworth Porter and published in 1889. The Sapper is published by the Royal Engineers Central Charitable Trust and is a bi-monthly magazine for all ranks. The Royal Engineers' Association The Royal Engineers Association was formed to promote and support the Corps among members of the Association in the following ways: *By fostering esprit de corps and a spirit of comradeship and service. *By maintaining an awareness of Corps traditions. *By acting as a link between serving and retired members of the Corps. *To provide financial and other assistance to serving and former members of the Corps, their wives, widows and dependants who are in need through poverty. *To make grants, within Association guidelines, to the Army Benevolent Fund and to other charities which further the objectives of the Association.

The Royal Engineers' Yacht Club, which dates back to 1812, promotes the skill of watermanship in the Royal Engineers. =Royal Engineers Amateur Football Club= The club was founded in 1863, under the leadership of Major Francis Marindin. Sir Frederick Wall, who was the secretary of The Football Association 1895‚Äì1934, stated in his memoirs that the \\"combination game\\" was first used by the Royal Engineers A.F.C. in the early 1870s.Cox, Richard (2002) The Encyclopaedia of British Football, Routledge, United KingdomHistory of Football Wall states that the \\"Sappers moved in unison\\" and showed the \\"advantages of combination over the old style of individualism\\". FA Cup Merriman, Ord, Marindin, Addison, Mitchell; Front: Hoskyns, Renny- Tailyour, Creswell, Goodwyn, Barker, Rich. The Engineers played in the first-ever FA Cup Final in 1872, losing 1‚Äì0 at Kennington Oval on 16 March 1872, to regular rivals Wanderers. They also lost the 1874 FA Cup Final, to Oxford University A.F.C.. Their greatest triumph was the 1874‚Äì75 FA Cup. In the final against Old Etonians, they drew 1‚Äì1 with a goal from Renny-Tailyour and went on to win the replay 2‚Äì0 with two further goals from Renny-Tailyour. Their last FA Cup Final appearance came in 1878, again losing to the Wanderers. They last participated in 1882‚Äì83 FA Cup, losing 6‚Äì2 in the fourth round to Old Carthusians F.C.. The Engineers' Depot Battalion won the FA Amateur Cup in 1908.History Section ‚Äì Welfare and Sports On 7 November 2012, the Royal Engineers played against the Wanderers in a remake of the 1872 FA Cup Final at The Oval. Unlike the actual final, the Engineers won, and by a large margin, 7‚Äì1 being the final score. =Rugby= The Army were represented in the very first international by two members of the Royal Engineers, both playing for England, Lieutenant Charles Arthur Crompton RE and Lieutenant Charles Sherrard RE.Army Players and International Representation (1871 onwards) Successor units Several units have been formed from the Royal Engineers. *The Air Battalion Royal Engineers (formed 1911) was the precursor of the Royal Flying Corps (formed 1912) which evolved into the Royal Air Force in 1918. *The Telegraph Troop, founded in 1870, became the Telegraph Battalion Royal Engineers who then became the Royal Engineers Signals Service, which in turn became the independent Royal Corps of Signals in 1920. *The Royal Engineers were responsible for railway and inland waterway transport, port operations and movement control until 1965, when these functions were transferred to the new Royal Corps of Transport. (See also Railway Operating Division.) The Royal Corps of Transport merged into the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993. *In 1913, the Army Post Office Corps (formed in 1882) and the Royal Engineers Telegraph Reserve (formed in 1884) amalgamated to form the Royal Engineers (Postal Section) Special Reserve. This later became the Defence Postal and Courier Service and remained part of the RE until the formation of the Royal Logistic Corps in 1993 ‚Äì see (British Forces Post Office). *When the Corps of Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (REME) was created in 1942, it was formed from personnel previously in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps, the Royal Army Service Corps, Royal Signals and Royal Engineers. After the war, the responsibilities of REME were increased in stages so that, by 1968, it had taken over responsibility for the maintenance of all Royal Engineers equipment, except construction equipment.

CDPs have been used in each decennial census since 1980 as the counterparts of incorporated places, such as self-governing cities, towns, and villages, for the purposes of gathering and correlating statistical data. CDPs are populated areas that generally include one officially designated but currently unincorporated community, for which the CDP is named, plus surrounding inhabited countryside of varying dimensions and, occasionally, other, smaller unincorporated communities as well. CDPs include small rural communities, colonias located along the Mexico‚ÄìUnited States border, and unincorporated resort and retirement communities and their environs. The boundaries of a CDP have no legal status and may not always correspond with the local understanding of the area or community with the same name. However, criteria established for the 2010 Census require that a CDP name \\"be one that is recognized and used in daily communication by the residents of the community\\" (not \\"a name developed solely for planning or other purposes\\") and recommend that a CDP's boundaries be mapped based on the geographic extent associated with inhabitants' regular use of the named place. The Census Bureau states that census-designated places are not considered incorporated places and that it includes only census- designated places in its city population list for Hawaii because that state has no incorporated cities. In addition, census city lists from 2007 included Arlington County, Virginia's CDP in the list with the incorporated places, but since 2010, only the Urban Honolulu CDP, Hawaii, representing the historic core of Honolulu, Hawaii, is shown in the city and town estimates. History The Census Bureau reported data for some unincorporated places as early as the first census, the 1790 Census (for example, Louisville, Kentucky, which was not legally incorporated in Kentucky until 1828), though usage continued to develop through the 1890 Census, in which, the Census mixed unincorporated places with incorporated places in its products with \\"town\\" or \\"village\\" as its label. This made it confusing to determine which of the \\"towns\\" were or were not incorporated.\\"Chapter 9 ‚Äì Places\\" in Geographic Areas Reference Manual (GARM), United States Census Bureau. Accessed November 19, 2016. The 1900 through 1930 Censuses did not report data for unincorporated places. For the 1940 Census, the Census Bureau compiled a separate report of unofficial, unincorporated communities of 500 or more people. The Census Bureau officially defined this category as \\"unincorporated places\\" in the 1950 Census and used that term through the 1970 Census. For the 1950 Census, these types of places were identified only outside \\"urbanized areas\\". In 1960, the Census Bureau also identified unincorporated places inside urbanized areas (except in New England, whose political geography is based on the New England town, and is distinctly different from other areas of the U.S.), but with a population of at least 10,000. For the 1970 Census, the population threshold for \\"unincorporated places\\" in urbanized areas was reduced to 5,000. For the 1980 Census, the designation was changed to \\"census designated places\\" and the designation was made available for places inside urbanized areas in New England. For the 1990 Census, the population threshold for CDPs in urbanized areas was reduced to 2,500. From 1950 through 1990, the Census Bureau specified other population requirements for unincorporated places or CDPs in Alaska, Puerto Rico, island areas, and Native American reservations. Minimum population criteria for CDPs were dropped with the 2000 Census.U.S. Bureau of the Census, Census Designated Place (CDP) Program for the 2010 Census ‚Äî Proposed Criteria, 72 Federal Register 17326-17329, April 6, 2007. The Census Bureau's Participant Statistical Areas Program (PSAP) allows designated participants to review and suggest modifications to the boundaries for CDPs. The PSAP was to be offered to county and municipal planning agencies during 2008. Effects of designation and examples The boundaries of such places may be defined in cooperation with local or tribal officials, but are not fixed, and do not affect the status of local government or incorporation; the territories thus defined are strictly statistical entities. CDP boundaries may change from one census to the next to reflect changes in settlement patterns. Further, as statistical entities, the boundaries of the CDP may not correspond with local understanding of the area with the same name. Recognized communities may be divided into two or more CDPs while on the other hand, two or more communities may be combined into one CDP. A CDP may also cover the unincorporated part of a named community where the rest lies within an incorporated place. By defining an area as a CDP, that locality then appears in the same category of census data as incorporated places. This distinguishes CDPs from other census classifications, such as minor civil divisions (MCDs), which are in a separate category. The population and demographics of the CDP are included in the data of county subdivisions containing the CDP. Generally, a CDP shall not be defined within the boundaries of what the Census Bureau regards to be an incorporated city, village or borough. However, the Census Bureau considers some towns in New England states, New Jersey and New York as well as townships in some other states as MCDs, even though they are incorporated municipalities in those states. In such states, CDPs may be defined within such towns or spanning the boundaries of multiple towns. Purpose of designation There are a number of reasons for the CDP designation: * The area may be more urban than its surroundings, having a concentration of population with a definite residential nucleus, such as Whitmore Lake, Michigan; Hershey, Pennsylvania; and The Villages, Florida (the latter CDP covering only a portion of the overall community). * A formerly incorporated place may disincorporate or be partly annexed by a neighboring town, but the former town or a part of it may still be reported by the census as a CDP by meeting criteria for a CDP. Examples are the former village of Covedale (village in Ohio), compared with Covedale (CDP), Ohio, or the recently disincorporated village of Seneca Falls (CDP), New York. * The area may contain an easily recognizable institution, usually occupying a large land area, with an identity distinct from the surrounding community. This could apply to some college campuses and large military bases (or parts of a military base) that are not within the limits of any existing community, such as Notre Dame, Indiana, Stanford, California (which houses the Stanford University campus), Fort Campbell North, Kentucky, and Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri. * In other cases, the boundary of an incorporated place may bisect a recognized community. An example of this is Bostonia, California, which straddles the city limits of El Cajon. The USGS places the nucleus of Bostonia within El Cajon. The Bostonia CDP covers the greater El Cajon area in unincorporated San Diego County that is generally north of that part of Bostonia within El Cajon. * In some states, a CDP may be defined within an incorporated municipality that (for the purposes of the census) is regarded as a minor civil division. For example, all towns in New England are incorporated municipalities, but may also include both rural and urban areas. CDPs may be defined to describe urbanized areas within such municipalities, as in the case of North Amherst, Massachusetts. * Hawaii is the only state that has no incorporated places recognized by the U.S. Census Bureau below the county level. All data for places in Hawaii reported by the census are CDPs. * Few CDPs represent an aggregation of several nearby communities, for example Shorewood-Tower Hills-Harbert, Michigan, or Egypt Lake-Leto, Florida. However, the Census Bureau has discontinued this method for most CDPs during the 2010 Census. * In rare cases, a CDP was also defined for the urbanized area surrounding an incorporated municipality, but which is outside the municipal boundaries, for example, Greater Galesburg, Michigan, or Greater Upper Marlboro, Maryland. This practice was discontinued in 2010. * In some states, the Census Bureau designates entire minor civil divisions (MCD) with an urban or suburban character as CDPs (for example West Bloomfield Township, Michigan, or Reading, Massachusetts). Such designations are used in states where the MCDs function with strong governmental authority and provide services equivalent to an incorporated municipality (New England, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin). MCDs appear in a separate category in census data from places (i.e., incorporated places and CDPs); however, when MCDs strongly resemble incorporated places, CDPs coterminous with the MCDs are defined so that such places appear in both categories of census data.

In a Spanish era when purity of Christian lineage (limpieza de sangre) was needed to gain access to education or official appointments, he adopted the surname of his mother, Leonor de G√≥ngora.Asociaci√≥n Cultural Nueva Acr√≥polis en Gand√≠a. G√ìNGORA Y GARIBALDI His uncle, Don Franscisco, a prebendary of C√≥rdoba Cathedral, renounced his post in favor of his nephew, who took deacon's orders in 1586.Arthur Terry, An Anthology of Spanish Poetry 1500‚Äì1700. Part II (Pergamon Press, 1968), 19. As a canon associated with this Cathedral, Luis de G√≥ngora traveled on diverse commissions to Navarre, Andalusia and Castile. The cities that he visited included Madrid, Salamanca, Granada, Ja√©n, and Toledo. Around 1605, he was ordained priest, and afterwards lived at Valladolid and Madrid. While his circle of admirers grew, patrons were grudging in their admiration. Ultimately, in 1617 through the influence of the Duke of Lerma, he was appointed honorary chaplain to King Philip III of Spain, but did not enjoy the honor long. He maintained a long feud with Francisco de Quevedo, who matched him in talent and wit. Both poets composed many bitter, satirical pieces attacking one other, with Quevedo criticizing G√≥ngora's penchant for flattery, his large nose, and his passion for gambling. Quevedo even accused his enemy of sodomy, which was a capital crime in 17th century Spain. In his \\"Contra el mismo (G√≥ngora)\\", Quevedo writes of G√≥ngora: No altar, garito s√≠; poco cristiano, / mucho tah√∫r, no cl√©rigo, s√≠ arp√≠a.\\"There's no altar, but there's a gambling den; not much of a Christian, / but he's very much a cardsharp, not a cleric, definitely a harpy.\\" G√≥ngora's nose, the subject of Quevedo's \\"A una nariz\\", begins with the lines: √ârase un hombre a una nariz pegado, / √©rase una nariz superlativa, / √©rase una nariz say√≥n y escriba, / √©rase un peje espada muy barbado.. Translation: \\"Once there was a man stuck to a nose, / it was a nose more marvellous than weird, / it was a nearly living web of tubes, / it was a swordfish with an awful beard.\\" This angry feud came to a nasty end for G√≥ngora when Quevedo bought the house he lived in for the only purpose of ejecting him from it. In 1626 a severe illness, which seriously impaired the poet's memory, forced him to return to C√≥rdoba, where he died the next year. By then he was broke from trying to obtain positions and win lawsuits for all his relatives. An edition of his poems was published almost immediately after his death by Juan L√≥pez de Vicu√±a; the frequently reprinted edition by Hozes did not appear until 1633. The collection consists of numerous sonnets, odes, ballads, songs for guitar, and of some larger poems, such as the Soledades and the F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea) (1612), the two landmark works of the highly refined style called \\"culteranismo\\" or \\"Gongorismo\\". Miguel de Cervantes, in his Viaje del Parnaso, catalogued the good and bad poets of his time. He considered G√≥ngora to be one of the good ones. Vel√°zquez painted his portrait. Numerous documents, lawsuits and satires of his rival Quevedo paint a picture of a man jovial, sociable, and talkative, who loved card-playing and bullfights. His bishop accused him of rarely attending choir, and of praying less than fervently when he did go. G√≥ngora's passion for card-playing ultimately contributed to his ruin.Bartolom√© Bennassar, The Spanish Character: Attitudes and Mentalities from the Sixteenth to the Nineteenth Century (Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1979), 167. Frequent allusions and metaphors associated with card-playing in G√≥ngora's poetry reveal that cards formed part of his daily life. He was often reproached for activities beneath the dignity of a churchman. Style Culteranismo existed in stark contrast with conceptismo, another movement of the Baroque period which is characterized by a witty style, games with words, simple vocabulary, and conveying multiple meanings in as few words as possible. The best-known representative of Spanish conceptismo, Francisco de Quevedo, had an ongoing feud with Luis de G√≥ngora in which each criticized the other's writing and personal life. The word culteranismo blends culto (\\"cultivated\\") and luteranismo (\\"Lutheranism\\") and was coined by its opponents to present it as a heresy of \\"true\\" poetry. The movement aimed to use as many words as possible to convey little meaning or to conceal meaning. \\"G√≥ngora's poetry is inclusive rather than exclusive\\", one scholar has written, \\"willing to create and incorporate the new, literally in the form of neologisms.\\"Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press,1993), 197. G√≥ngora's signature. G√≥ngora had a penchant for highly Latinate and Greek neologisms, which his opponents mocked. Quevedo lampooned his rival by writing a sonnet, \\"Aguja de navegar cultos,\\" which listed words from G√≥ngora's lexicon: \\"He would like to be a culto poet in just one day, / must the following jargon learn: / Fulgores, arrogar, joven, presiente / candor, construye, m√©trica, armon√≠a...\\"Quoted in D√°maso Alonso, La lengua po√©tica de G√≥ngora (Madrid: Revista de Filolog√≠a Espa√±ola, 1950), 114. Quevedo actually mocked G√≥ngora's style in several sonnets, including \\"Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo.\\"CVC. Las s√°tiras de Quevedo. El soneto de Quevedo: ¬´Sulquivagante, pretensor de Estolo¬ª: ensayo de interpretaci√≥n This anti-Gongorist sonnet mocks the unintelligibility of culteranismo and its widespread use of flowery neologisms, including sulquivagante (he who plies the seas; to travel without a clear destination); speluncas (\\"caves\\"); surculos (sprouts, scions). He was also the first to write poems imitating the speech of blacks.Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press, 1993), 197. G√≥ngora also had a penchant for apparent breaks in syntactical flow, as he overturned the limitations of syntax, making the hyperbaton the most prominent feature of his poetry.Roberto Gonz√°lez Echevarr√≠a, Celestina's Brood: Continuities of the Baroque in Spanish and Latin American Literature (Duke University Press,1993), 197. He has been called a man of \\"unquestioned genius and almost limitless culture, an initiator who enriched his language with the vast power, beauty, and scope of a mighty pen.\\"John Armstrong Crow, The Epic of Latin America (University of California Press, 1992), 300. As far away as Peru, he received the praise of Juan de Espinosa Medrano (ca. 1629‚Äì1688), who wrote a piece defending G√≥ngora's poetry from criticism called Apolog√©tico en favor de Don Luis de G√≥ngora, Pr√≠ncipe de los poetas lyricos de Espa√±a: contra Manuel de Faria y Sousa, Cavallero portugu√©s (1662).Biografia de Juan de Espinosa Medrano As D√°maso Alonso has pointed out, Gongora's contribution to the Spanish language should not be underestimated, as he picked up what were in his time obscure or little-used words and used them in his poetry again and again, thereby reviving or popularizing them. Many of these words are quite common today, such as adolescente, asunto, brillante, construir, eclipse, emular, erigir, fragmento, frustrar, joven, meta, and porci√≥n.D√°maso Alonso, La lengua po√©tica de G√≥ngora (Madrid: Revista de Filolog√≠a Espa√±ola, 1950), 112.  Works  Title page of the Chacon Manuscript. G√≥ngora's poems are usually grouped into two blocks, corresponding more or less to two successive poetic stages. His F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea (Fable of Polyphemus and Galatea) and his Soledades (1613) are his best-known compositions and the most studied.Personas que escriben bonito The F√°bula is written in royal octaves (octavas reales) and his Soledades is written in a variety of metres and strophes, but principally in stanzas and silvas interspersed with choruses.Personas que escriben bonito G√≥ngora's F√°bula de Polifemo y Galatea (1612) narrates a mythological episode described in Ovid's Metamorphoses: the love of Polyphemus, one of the Cyclopes, for the nymph Galatea, who rejects him. In the poem's end, Acis, enamored with Galatea, is turned into a river.Personas que escriben bonito G√≥ngora's F√°bula de P√≠ramo y Tisbe (Fable of Pyramus and Thisbe) (1618) is a complex poem that mocks gossiping and avaricious women. G√≥ngora also wrote sonnets concerning various subjects of an amatory, satirical, moral, philosophical, religious, controversial, laudatory, and funereal nature. As well as the usual topics (carpe diem etc.) the sonnets include autobiographical elements, describing, for example, the increasing decrepitude and advancing age of the author. In addition, G√≥ngora composed one of his most ambitions works, El Paneg√≠rico al Duque de Lerma (1617), a poem in 79 royal octaves. Cervantes, after reading \\"El Paneg√≠rico\\", said: \\"the [work] I most esteem from those I've read of his.\\"http://www.upf.edu/todogongora/_pdf/Ponce_Cxrdenas_El_Panegxrico_al_duque_de_Lerma_Trascendencia_de_un_modelo_gongorino.pdf He also wrote plays, which include La destrucci√≥n de Troya, Las firmezas de Isabela, and the unfinished Doctor Carlino.Personas que escriben bonito Although G√≥ngora did not publish his works (he had attempted to do so in 1623), manuscript copies were circulated and compiled in cancioneros (songbooks), and anthologies published with or without his permission. In 1627, Juan Lopez Vicu√±a published Verse Works of the Spanish Homer, which is also considered very trustworthy and important in establishing the G√≥ngora's corpus of work. Vicu√±a's work was appropriated by the Spanish Inquisition and was later surpassed by an edition by Gonzalo de Hozes in 1633. G√≥ngora and the Generation of '27 The Generation of '27 took its name from the year 1927 in which the tricentennial of G√≥ngora's death, ignored by official academic circles, was celebrated with recitals, avant-garde happenings, and an ambitious plan to publish a new critical edition of his work, as well as books and articles on aspects of his work that had not been fully researched.C√©sar Augusto Salgado, From Modernism to Neobaroque: Joyce and Lezama Lima (2001, Bucknell University Press), 37. The Generation of '27 was the first to attempt to self-consciously revive baroque literature. D√°maso Alonso wrote that G√≥ngora's complex language conveyed meaning in that it created a world of pure beauty. Alonso explored his work exhaustively and called G√≥ngora a \\"mystic of words.\\"Personas que escriben bonito Alonso dispelled the notion that G√≥ngora had two separate styles ‚Äì\\"simple\\" and \\"difficult\\" poems- that were also divided chronologically between his early and later years. He argued that G√≥ngora's more complex poems built on stylistic devices that had been created in G√≥ngora's early career as a poet. He also argued that the apparent simplicity of some of G√≥ngora's early poems is often deceptive.Arthur Terry, An Anthology of Spanish Poetry 1500‚Äì1700. Part II (Pergamon Press, 1968), 20. Rafael Alberti added his own Soledad tercera (Par√°frasis incompleta).Argos 16/ Ensayo/ Guadalupe Mercado In 1961, Alberti declared, \\"I am a visual poet, like all of the poets from Andalusia, from G√≥ngora to Garc√≠a Lorca.\\"Quoted in C.B. Morris, This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920‚Äì1936 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 87. Lorca presented a lecture called \\"La imagen po√©tica en don Lu√≠s de G√≥ngora\\" at the Ateneo in Seville in 1927.Garcia Lorca, Federico ‚Äì CanalSocial ‚Äì Enciclopedia GER In this lecture, Lorca paid Jean Epstein the compliment of comparing the film director with G√≥ngora as an authority on images.C.B. Morris, This Loving Darkness: The Cinema and Spanish Writers 1920‚Äì1936 (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1980), 47. References in fiction and philosophy The philosopher Baruch Spinoza proposed in his Ethics (1677) that a man can die before his body stops moving. As an example he mentioned \\"a Spanish poet who suffered an illness; though he recovered, he was left so oblivious to his past life that he did not believe the tales and tragedies he had written were his own\\".Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569 (scholium to proposition 39 of part 4) The historian Carl Gebhardt wrote that \\"this was probably G√≥ngora, whose works Spinoza possessed, and who lost his memory a year before his death\\".Spinoza (1677/1985), p. 569, footnote 22 The narrator of the Captain Alatriste series, a friend of Francisco de Quevedo within the stories, illustrates G√≥ngora's feuding with Quevedo, both by quoting poetry from each as well as describing Quevedo's attitude toward G√≥ngora through the course of the story. Excerpts of poetry from one against the other are included within the story itself and poetry from each is included at the back of some of the books. Lawrence Durrell in his novel Clea (1960), part of The Alexandria Quartet, includes a passage from the journal of his fictional novelist Pursewarden: \\"Why should the artist always be trying to saturate the world with his own anguish‚Ä¶emotional Gongorism!\\" In Giannina Braschi's bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998) contemporary Latin American poets have a heated debate about G√≥ngora's and Quevedo's role in defining the Spanish empire through their works. The musical group Dead Can Dance used an English translation of G√≥ngora's Da bienes Fortuna as the lyrics for the song \\"Fortune Presents Gifts Not According to the Book\\" on their 1990 album Aion. In the second of the five parts of Roberto Bola√±o's novel 2666 (published posthumously in 2004), \\"The Part about Amalfitano\\", one of the characters (the poet, whose name is never explicitly stated) quotes a verse from G√≥ngora: Ande yo caliente y r√≠ase la gente.

Karl August Varnhagen von Ense (21 February 1785 in D√ºsseldorf ‚Äì 10 October 1858 in Berlin) was a German biographer, diplomat and soldier. Life and career He was born in D√ºsseldorf, the younger brother of Rosa Maria Varnhagen, a noted poet, writer, and educator. He studied medicine in Berlin, but most of his time was spent examining philosophy and literature, which he later studied more thoroughly at Halle and T√ºbingen. He began his literary career in 1804 working along with Adelbert von Chamisso on his Berliner Musenalmanach. In 1809, he joined the main Austrian army under Archduke Charles, serving in IR47 Vogelsang at the Battle of Wagram, where he was wounded on the first day, 5th July. Von Ense ‚Äò‚ÄôDie Schlacht Von Deutsch-Wagram am 5. und 6. July 1809‚Äô‚Äô (Vienna) (1909) He was then made adjutant to Prince Bentheim, whom he accompanied to Paris, where he continued his studies. In 1812, he entered the Prussian civil service in Berlin but soon left to enter the Russian service as captain. He served in Tettenborn's corps as adjutant to Tettenborn on trips to Hamburg and Paris. He recorded his experiences in Geschichte der Hamburger Ereignisse (History of the events in Hamburg; London, 1813) and Geschichte der Kriegsz√ºge Tettenborns (History of Tettenborn's Campaigns, 1814). He worked as a tutor and butler in the homes of several families of the wealthy Jewish bourgeoisie. This allowed him to learn from an early age young characters in his time, some already famous, such as: Adelbert von Chamisso, Justinus Kerner, Friedrich de la Motte Fouqu√©, Ludwig Uhland and many other poets of romanticism. He accompanied Prince Hardenberg to the Congress of Vienna in 1814, and between 1815 and 1819 he served as Prussian Minister-Resident at Carlsruhe. After 1819, he resided chiefly in Berlin, bearing the title ‚ÄúGeheimer Legationsrat.‚Äù He had no fixed official appointment but was often employed in important political business. He carried on an extensive correspondence with Alexander von Humboldt, and two volumes of Humboldt's letters to him have been published.Letters of Alexander von Humboldt to Varnhagen von Ense.

He possessed a remarkable ability to group facts together and to bring out their essential significance. His style is distinguished for its strength, grace and purity. Among his principal works are: *Goethe in den Zeugnissen der Mitlebenden (1824) *Biographische Denkm√§ler (5 vols., 1824‚Äì30; 3rd ed., 1872) *Biographies of General von Seydlitz (1834), Field-Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Bl√ºcher, victor over Napoleon at Waterloo, Sophia Charlotte, Queen of Prussia (1837), Field-Marshal Schwerin (1841), Field-Marshal Keith (1844), and General B√ºlow von Dennewitz (1853) His Denkw√ºrdigkeiten und vermischte Schriften appeared in nine volumes in 1843-59, the last two volumes appearing after his death. His niece, Ludmilla Assing, between 1860 and 1867, edited several volumes of his correspondence with eminent men and his Tageb√ºcher (14 vols., 1861‚Äì70). Bl√§tter aus der preussischen Geschichte appeared in five volumes (1868‚Äì69); his correspondence with his wife, Rahel, appeared in six volumes in 1874‚Äì75; and that with Carlyle in 1892. His selected writings appeared in 19 volumes in 1871-76. Family In 1814, he married saloniste Rahel Levin after she converted from Judaism to Christianity. Varnhagen was devotedly attached to her and found in her sympathy and encouragement. She was one of the chief sources of his inspiration as a writer. He never fully recovered from the shock of her death in 1833, but he published memorial volumes containing selections from her papers: Rahel, ein Buch des Andenkens f√ºr ihre Freunde (Rahel, a memorial book for her friends, 3 vols., 1834) and Galerie von Bildnissen aus Rahels Umgang (A gallery of portraits from Rahel's circle, 2 vols., 1836).

As a propellant, it is described in specification MIL-PRF-27404. MMH is a hydrazine derivative that was once used in the orbital maneuvering system (OMS) and reaction control system (RCS) engines of NASA's Space Shuttle, which used MMH and MON-3 (a mixture of nitrogen tetroxide with approximately 3% nitric oxide). This chemical is toxic and carcinogenic in small amounts, but it is easily stored in orbit providing moderate performance for very low fuel tank system weight. MMH and its chemical relative unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine (UDMH) have a key advantage that they are stable enough to be used in regeneratively cooled rocket engines.

Early life Born in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, he was the son of William Dudman Killam and Arabella Hunter (Belle) Cann. Business ventures As a young banker with the Union Bank of Halifax, Killam became close friends with John F. Stairs and Max Aitken (Lord Beaverbrook) who put Killam in charge of his Royal Securities. In 1919, Killam bought out Aitken and took full control of the company. Killam's business dealings primarily involved the financing of large pulp and paper and hydro-electric projects throughout Canada and Latin America. Killam was believed to be the richest man in Canada at the time. One of his larger projects in his native province was the creation of the Mersey Paper Company Ltd. and its related electrical generating stations and shipping fleet. In 1922 he married Dorothy Brooks Johnston. Notwithstanding his prodigious financial accomplishments, Killam was a very reserved man who eschewed publicity and was virtually unknown outside a small circle of close acquaintances. Killam died in 1955 at his Quebec fishing lodge. By then he was considered to be the richest man in Canada. In 1927 Killam acquired The Mail and Empire and was later sold in 1936.http://www.biographi.ca/en/bio/riordon_charles_alfred_16E.html Philanthropy Having no children, Killam and his wife devoted the greater part of their wealth to higher education in Canada. The Killam Trusts, established in the will of Mrs. Killam, are held by five Canadian universities: the University of British Columbia, University of Alberta, University of Calgary, Dalhousie University and McGill University. The current market value of the Killam endowment is approximately CAD$400 million and it is used to fund scientific research and artistic ventures across Canada. Dalhousie University in Halifax benefited the most, having received a $30 million bequest from Dorothy Killam's estate in 1965 ($214 million in 2011 when adjusted for inflation), representing 32% of her fortune. The Killam Memorial Library constructed between 1966 and 1971 at a cost of $7.3 million ($52 million in 2011) was designed by architect Leslie R. Fairn and remains an enduring legacy to this day. Money from the Killam estate also went to establish Izaak Walton Killam Hospital for Children in Halifax and the Montreal Neurological Institute in Montreal.

They are yellow rodent-like creatures (large-eared pika) with powerful electrical abilities. In most vocalized appearances, including the anime and certain video games, they are primarily voiced by Ikue ≈åtani. A Pikachu also appears as part of the main cast in the live-action animated film Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu, played in CGI and voiced by Ryan Reynolds. The Pikachu design was conceived by Atsuko Nishida and finalized by Ken Sugimori. Pikachu first appeared in Pok√©mon Red and Green in Japan, and later in the first internationally released Pok√©mon video games, Pok√©mon Red and Blue, for the original Game Boy. Pikachu are one of the most well-known varieties of Pok√©mon, largely because Pikachu is a central character (starter Pok√©mon of Ash) in the Pok√©mon anime series. Pikachu is a major character of the Pok√©mon franchise as well as its mascot, and has become an icon of Japanese pop culture in recent years and one of the major mascots for Nintendo. Concept and design Pikachu as depicted in promotional artwork for Pok√©mon Red and Blue, its first appearance Developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo, the Pok√©mon series began in Japan in 1996, and features several species of creatures called \\"Pok√©mon\\" that players, called \\"trainers\\", are encouraged to capture, train, and use to battle other players' Pok√©mon or interact with the game's world. Pikachu was one of several different Pok√©mon designs conceived by Game Freak's character development team. Artist Atsuko Nishida is credited as the main person behind Pikachu's design, which was later finalized by artist Ken Sugimori. According to series producer Satoshi Tajiri, the name is derived from a combination of two Japanese sounds: pika, a sound an electric spark makes, and chu, a sound a mouse makes. Despite its name's origins, however, Nishida based Pikachu's generation 1 design, especially its cheeks, on squirrels.https://kotaku.com/pikachu-wasnt-based-on-a-mouse-but-a- squirrel-1825738117 Developer Junichi Masuda noted Pikachu's name as one of the most difficult to create, due to an effort to make it appealing to both Japanese and American audiences. Standing tall, Pikachu were the first \\"Electric-type\\" Pok√©mon created, their design intended to revolve around the concept of electricity. They appear as Pika-like creatures that have short, yellow fur with brown markings covering their backs and parts of their lightning bolt-shaped tails. They have black-tipped, pointed ears and red circular pouches on their cheeks, which can spark with electricity.Pok√©dex: It lives in forests with others. It stores electricity in the pouches on its cheeks. In Pok√©mon Diamond and Pearl, gender differences were introduced; a female Pikachu now has an indent at the end of its tail, giving it a heart- shaped appearance. They attack primarily by projecting electricity from their bodies at their targets. Within the context of the franchise, a Pikachu can transform, or \\"evolve,\\" into a Raichu when exposed to a \\"Thunderstone.\\" In later titles an evolutionary predecessor was introduced named \\"Pichu\\", which evolves into a Pikachu after establishing a close friendship with its trainer. Initially both Pikachu and the Pok√©mon Clefairy were chosen to be lead characters for the franchise merchandising, with the latter as the primary mascot to make the early comic book series more \\"engaging\\". However, with the production of the animated series, Pikachu was chosen as the primary mascot, in an attempt to appeal to female viewers and their mothers, and because it was believed that Pikachu presented the image of a recognizable intimate pet to children. Its color was also a deciding factor, as yellow is a primary color and easier for children to recognize from a distance, and with consideration to the fact that the only other competing yellow mascot at the time was Winnie-the-Pooh. Though Tajiri acknowledged that the character was relatively popular with both boys and girls, the idea of Pikachu as the mascot was not his own, with the company responsible for the production of the animated series OLM, Inc. giving the suggestion to utilize Pikachu's potential to Game Freak, and stated he felt the human aspect of the series was overlooked by Japanese children who embraced Pikachu by itself more readily. Pikachu was originally going to have a second evolution called Gorochu, which was intended to be the evolved form of Raichu. Appearances =In video games= Red in Pok√©mon Yellow. In the video games, Pikachu is a Pok√©mon which has appeared in all of the games, except Black and White, without having to trade. The game Pok√©mon Yellow features a Pikachu as the only available Starter Pok√©mon. Based on the Pikachu from the Pok√©mon anime, it refuses to stay in its Pok√© Ball, and instead follows the main character around on screen. The trainer can speak to it and it displays different reactions depending on how it is treated. Pok√©mon Yellow followed the anime series closely, with Pikachu as a central character. Pok√©mon Let's Go, which is based heavily on Yellow, has Pikachu as a starter in one of its two versions, with the latter version using Eevee instead. In Pok√©mon Emerald, Pikachu and its evolutionary family gained Volt Tackle as a signature move, learned by the Pichu hatched from an Egg made by a Pikachu or Raichu holding a Light Ball. It can also be learned by Pikachu directly through events and tutors. An event from April 1 to May 5, 2010 allowed players of Pok√©mon HeartGold and SoulSilver to access a route on the Pok√©walker which solely contained Pikachu which knew attacks that they were not normally compatible with, Surf and Fly. Both of these attacks can be used outside battles as travel aids. Seven \\"Cap\\" forms of Pikachu, wearing caps belonging to anime protagonist Ash Ketchum across different seasons, were released across Pok√©mon Sun and Moon as well as their Ultra versions. These games also released two Z-Crystals exclusive to Pikachu: Pikanium Z, which upgrades Volt Tackle into Catastropika, and Pikashunium Z, which upgrades Thunderbolt into 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt when held by a Cap form of Pikachu. Aside from the main series, Pikachu stars in Hey You, Pikachu! for the Nintendo 64.Hey You, Pikachu! Nintendo.com'.' Retrieved July 17, 2006. The player interacts with Pikachu through a microphone, issuing commands to play various mini-games and act out situations. The game Pok√©mon Channel follows a similar premise of interacting with the Pikachu, though without the microphone. Pikachu appear in almost all levels of Pok√©mon Snap, a game where the player takes pictures of Pok√©mon for a score.

Detective Pikachu features a talking Pikachu who becomes a detective and helps to solve mysteries. =In anime= Ash receiving his Pikachu in the first episode of the Pok√©mon anime, Pok√©mon - I Choose You!. The Pok√©mon anime series and films feature the adventures of Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu, traveling through the various regions of the Pok√©mon universe. They are accompanied by a group of alternating friends, including Misty, Brock, Tracey, May, Max, Dawn, Iris, Cilan, Bonnie, Serena, Clemont, Lillie, Kiawe, Mallow, Lana, Sophocles, and Goh. In the first episode, Ash Ketchum, a young boy from Pallet Town, turns 10 years old and is ready to acquire his first Pok√©mon. Hopeful to become a Pok√©mon Master, the night before he receives his starter Pok√©mon (either Squirtle, Charmander or Bulbasaur) he has a dream where he is catching a Pok√©mon and actually, while sleeping, physically breaks his alarm clock. Ash quickly runs to Professor Oak's lab, where he finds out all the starter Pok√©mon have been given away. Professor Oak tells Ash there is one more Pok√©mon, a male Pikachu. At first, Pikachu largely ignores Ash's requests, shocking him frequently and refusing to be confined to the conventional method of Pok√©mon transportation, a Pok√© Ball. However, Ash puts himself in danger to defend Pikachu from a flock of wild Spearow, then rushes the electric mouse to a Pok√©mon Center. Through these demonstrations of respect and unconditional commitment to Pok√©mon, Pikachu warms up to Ash, and their friendship is formed. However, he still refuses to go into his Pok√© Ball. Soon after, Pikachu shows great power that sets him apart from other Pok√©mon, and other Pikachu, which causes Team Rocket to constantly attempt to capture him in order to win favor from their boss, Giovanni. Only once had Ash almost released Pikachu, and that was in the episode \\"Pikachu's Goodbye\\", because Ash thought Pikachu would be happier living in a colony of wild Pikachu, but Pikachu chose him instead. Other wild and trained Pikachu appear throughout the series, often interacting with Ash and his Pikachu. The most notable among these is Ritchie's Pikachu, Sparky. Like most other Pok√©mon, Pikachu communicates only by saying syllables of his own name. He is voiced by Ikue ≈åtani in all versions of the anime. In Pok√©mon Live!, the musical stage show adapted from the anime, Pikachu was played by Jennifer Risser, but still remained voiced by Ikue ≈åtani. =In film= A specific Pikachu character, Detective Pikachu, is voiced by Ryan Reynolds in the 2019 film Pok√©mon Detective Pikachu. In the Japanese version, Ikue ≈åtani provided the character's voice just like in the anime. =In other Pok√©mon media= Pikachu is one of the main Pok√©mon used in many of the Pok√©mon manga series. In Pok√©mon Adventures, main characters Red and Yellow both train Pikachu, which create an egg that Gold hatches into a Pichu. Other series, including Magical Pok√©mon Journey and Getto Da Ze also feature Pikachu while other manga series, such as Electric Tale of Pikachu, and Ash & Pikachu, feature the most well known Pikachu belonging to Ketchum in the anime series.\\"Animerica Interview Toshihiro Ono.\\" VIZ Media.

(2006), The Forgotten Expedition, 1804-1805: The Louisiana Purchase Journals of Dunbar and Hunter, Editors' Introduction, p. xi Roughly contemporaneous with the Lewis and Clark Expedition, it was led by United States Army Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, Jr. who was promoted to captain during the trip. It was the first official American effort to explore the western Great Plains and the Rocky Mountains in present-day Colorado. Pike contacted several Native American tribes during his travels and informed them of the new US rule over the territory. The expedition documented the United States' discovery of Pikes Peak. After splitting up his men, Pike led the larger contingent to find the headwaters of the Red River. A smaller group returned safely to the US Army fort in St. Louis, Missouri before winter set in. Pike's company made several errors and ended up in Spanish territory in present-day Southern Colorado, where the Americans built a fort to survive the winter. Captured by the Spanish and taken into Mexico in February, their travels through present-day New Mexico, Mexico, and Texas provided Pike with important data about Spanish military strength and civilian populations. Although he and most of his men were released because the nations were not at war, some of his soldiers were held in Mexican prisons for years, despite US objections. In 1810, Pike published an account of his expeditions, which was so popular that it was translated into French, German, and Dutch for publication in Europe. Exploration Historical marker at the site of the Pawnee village visited by Pike in what is now Nebraska On June 24, 1806, General James Wilkinson, commander of the Western Department, ordered Lieutenant Zebulon Pike, then age 27, to lead an expedition to the western and southern areas of the Louisiana Purchase to map the terrain, contact the Native American peoples, and to find the headwaters of the Red River.Hart; Hulbert, p. 57 Pike left Fort Bellefontaine near St. Louis, Missouri on July 15 with a detachment of 20 soldiers and 50 Osage hostages, freed for return to their people. The expedition followed the Missouri River and the Osage River to the Osage Nation village at the present-day border of Kansas and Missouri. On August 15, Pike returned the hostages and parleyed with the natives.Hart; Hulbert, pp. 86‚Äì88 Striking northwest, the group made for the Pawnee territory on the Republican River in southern Nebraska. At the Pawnee village on September 29, Pike met with the Pawnee tribal council. He announced the new protectorship of the United States government over the territory.Hart; Hulbert, pp. 114‚Äì115 He instructed the Pawnee to remove a Spanish flag from their village and to fly the American flag instead. The expeditionary force turned south and struck out across the prairie for the Arkansas River. After reaching it on October 14, the party split in two. One group was led by Lieutenant James Biddle Wilkinson, son of the General.Terrell, John U. (1968). Zebulon Pike: The Life and Times of an Adventurer, Weybright and Talley. p. 75 They traveled downstream along the length of the Arkansas to its mouth and back up the Mississippi, safely returning to St. Louis. Pike led the other, larger group upstream, to the west, toward the headwaters of the Arkansas. Upon traversing the Great Plains, Pike wrote, \\"This vast plains of the western hemisphere may become in time as celebrated as the sandy deserts of Africa; for I saw in my route, in various places, tracts of many leagues where the wind had thrown up the sand in all the fanciful form of the ocean's rolling wave, and on which not a speck of vegetable matter existed.\\"Hollon, p. 111 When Stephen Long led an expedition to the area in 1820, he labeled the area on his map as the \\"Great American Desert.\\" =Pike in Colorado= Photograph of a portion of a Colorado wayside marker located where the Medano Pass Primitive Road (CR 599) joins Rt 69, just south of Westcliffe: \\"1806-07 Lt. Zebulon Pike Southwestern Expedition\\", showing a map of routes taken by Pike's group On November 15, Pike recorded the first sight of the distant mountain he called \\"Grand Peak\\".Hart; Hulbert, p. 138 It has since been called Pikes Peak in his honor. Pike tried to climb the peak, hoping to get a view of the surrounding area to record on maps, the 14,000-foot summit. Pike's group ascended a lesser summit nearby‚Äîlikely Mount Miller, which was named for Theodore Miller, one of the soldiers who accompanied Pike.Hart; Hulbert, p. 144 With winter threatening, Pike pressed onward up the Arkansas, and on December 7 the party reached Royal Gorge, a spectacular canyon on the Arkansas at the base of the Rocky Mountains. Pike next intended to travel to the headwaters of the Red River and head downstream to the Mississippi and relative safety in the lowlands. But, the company had gotten confused in its bearings, and they made several blundering steps trying to find the river. They were not equipped for a mountain expedition, nor for hard winter weather. Heading north, the party found the South Fork of the Platte River and, following it upstream, came to what they thought were the headwaters of the Red. Turning back downstream, they returned to the point at which they had left the Arkansas originally. They had executed a large loop, taking weeks of precious travel time. Hungry, cold, and exhausted, the party headed south over the mountains. Several men were left behind as they dropped from fatigue, but Pike doggedly pressed on. By January 30, he and the ten men still with him came to the Rio Grande at a point near Alamosa in present-day southern Colorado and then part of the Spanish empire. Pike mistook the Rio Grande for the Red River he had been seeking. Here, he built a fort and attempted to collect the rest of his men, who were strewn across miles of mountains behind him. Capture A reconstruction of Pike's Stockade in what is now Colorado On February 26, in the night Pike and his remaining men were captured at their fort by Spanish soldiers from nearby Santa Fe. Arresting the party as spies, the Spanish collected the rest of his men who had been scattered in the mountains, and marched them all south. The Spanish took them through Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and El Paso to Los Coabos, the state capital of Chihuahua.Buescher, John. \\"Trailing Lewis and Clark.\\" Teachinghistory.org. Accessed July 12, 2011. Along the way, Pike's party was treated with respect and celebrated by the Mexican locals, and Pike made careful notes of the military strength and civilian population. Chihuahua's Governor Salcedo released Pike and most of his men, as they were military officers of a neighboring country, with whom Spain was not at war. He ordered the repatriation of Pike, but held some of the soldiers of his party in jail in Mexico for years. The Spanish military escorted Pike and some of his party back north, through San Antonio, Texas, arriving at the border with Louisiana at Natchitoches on July 1, 1807. The Spanish formally complained to the United States Department of State about the military expedition in its territory, but the government maintained that the party had been one of exploration only. Pike's capture by the Spanish and travels through New Mexico, northern Mexico, and Texas, gave him more information about Spanish power than his expedition could have done.

It is situated in the northern area of Southsea bordering Fratton, and lies close to Fratton railway station on the A2047. History The current site was originally purchased by the Portsmouth School Board in May 1890 for ¬£3000, at the time the area was known as \\"The Wilderness\\" due to the lack of development activity. On the site were several buildings in a heavy state of disrepair, among the buildings were Howard's Cottage reputedly the oldest building in Portsmouth and home to the ghost of Lady Temple. The construction of the school cost ¬£9,704 and took two years, the buildings were completed in May 1892. Later extensions of the school site led it to cover the site of an old priory and a farm called Priory Farm. In 1905 it was decided that the Francis Avenue School for girls should move to a building next to the boys school. This school, which cost ¬£25,000 to build, was opened on 4 November 1907. During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 5th Southern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. During the 1920s the school became heavily over-crowded and an extension to the girls school was competed in 1934. Portsmouth was considered a high-risk target during the Second World War and the girls school moved to Salisbury. On 10 January 1941, German bombing led to the destruction of the boys school and the extension at the girls school. The boys moved to the St Ronan's Road School, with the old boys school being left as a bombed out wreck for the next twenty years. In 1946 the girls school became the Portsmouth Southern Grammar School for Girls. The Southern Grammar School for Boys was on Eastern Road and went on to be part of Portsmouth College. In the late 1950s the boys school was demolished and replaced with a gymnasium for the girls school. A lecture theatre was completed in the 1960s. In 1974 the boys school returned to the site, this time merging with the girls school to form Priory comprehensive school. The school became a specialist sports college with the opening of the Priory Tennis Centre in 2006 and it became an academy, sponsored by the Bohunt Education Trust, in September 2014. Admissions Stewart Vaughan is the Headteacher at the school. Priory school is an academy and part of the Bohunt Education Trust.

Life and career  Gottschalk was born in New Orleans to an Ashkenazi Jewish businessman from London (Edward Gottschalk) and a French Creole mother (Aim√©e Marie Brusl√©). He had six brothers and sisters, five of whom were half-siblings by his father's biracial mistress.Starr, S. Frederick, 1995. Bamboula! The life and times of Louis Moreau Gottschalk. Oxford, NY, pp. 22 et seq. His family lived for a time in a tiny cottage at Royal and Esplanade in the Vieux Carr√©. Louis later moved in with relatives at 518 Conti Street; his maternal grandmother Brusl√© and his nurse Sally had both been born in Saint-Domingue (known later as Haiti). He was therefore exposed to a variety of musical traditions, and played the piano from an early age. He was soon recognized as a prodigy by the New Orleans bourgeois establishment, making his informal public debut in 1840 at the new St. Charles Hotel. Only two years later, at the age of 13, Gottschalk left the United States and sailed to Europe, as he and his father realized a classical training was required to fulfill his musical ambitions. The Paris Conservatoire, however, rejected his application without hearing him, on the grounds of his nationality; Pierre Zimmerman, head of the piano faculty, commented that \\"America is a country of steam engines\\". Gottschalk eventually gained access to the musical establishment through family friends but the importance of early compositions like Bamboula (Danse Des N√®gres) and La Savane cannot be overstated as they established him as a genuinely American composer, and not a mere copycat of the European written tradition, a major artistic statement as they carried a legacy of slave music in a romantic music context, and as such they were also precursors of jazz. They still stand as the first musical examples of Louisiana Creole musical culture. After a concert at the Salle Pleyel, Fr√©d√©ric Chopin remarked: \\"Give me your hand, my child; I predict that you will become the king of pianists.\\" Franz Liszt and Charles-Valentin Alkan, too, recognised Gottschalk's extreme talent. After Gottschalk returned to the United States in 1853, he traveled extensively; a sojourn in Cuba during 1854 was the beginning of a series of trips to Central and South America. Gottschalk also traveled to Puerto Rico after his Havana debut and at the start of his West Indian period. He was quite taken with the music he heard on the island, so much so that he composed a work, probably in 1857, entitled Souvenir de Porto Rico; Marche des gibaros, Op. 31 (RO250). \\"Gibaros\\" refers to the j√≠baros, or Puerto Rican peasantry, and is an antiquated way of writing this name. The theme of the composition is a march tune which may be based on a Puerto Rican folk song form.Louis Moreau Gottschalk Piano Music. Edward Gold, piano (B√∂sendorfer). Liner notes by Edward Gold. The Musical Heritage Society Inc. MHS 1629. At the conclusion of that tour, he rested in New Jersey then returned to New York City. There he continued to rest and took on a very young Venezuelan student, Teresa Carre√±o. Gottschalk rarely took on students and was skeptical of prodigies, but Carre√±o was an exception and he was determined that she succeed. With his busy schedule, Gottschalk was only able to give her a handful of lessons, yet she would remember him fondly and performed his music for the rest of her days. A year after meeting Gottschalk, she performed for Abraham Lincoln and would go on to become a renowned concert pianist earning the nickname \\"Valkyrie of the Piano\\". In late 1855 and early 1856 Gottschalk made connections with several notable figures of the New York art world, including the sculptor Erastus Dow Palmer, composer and musician George William Warren and Hudson River School landscape painter Frederic Edwin Church.. Like Gottschalk, Church had traveled extensively in Latin America (primarily Ecuador and Colombia) and produced a series of large-scale canvases of South American subject. Gottschalk dedicated a Mazurka po√©tique to Church, who gave Gottschalk a small (now unidentified) landscape painting. Gottschalk also possibly collaborated with Warren on his 1863 The Andes, Marche di Bravoura, a solo piano piece inspired by Church's large-scale South American painting of 1859, The Heart of the Andes.. By the 1860s, Gottschalk had established himself as the best known pianist in the New World. Although born and reared in New Orleans, he was a supporter of the Union cause during the American Civil War. He returned to his native city only occasionally for concerts, but he always introduced himself as a New Orleans native. He composed the tarantella, Grande Tarantelle, Op. 67, subtitled C√©l√®bre Tarentelle, during 1858-64. In May 1865, he was mentioned in a San Francisco newspaper as having \\"travelled 95,000 miles by rail and given 1,000 concerts\\". However, he was forced to leave the United States later that year because of a scandalous affair with a student at the Oakland Female Seminary in Oakland, California. He never returned to the United States. Gottschalk chose to travel to South America, where he continued to give frequent concerts. During one of these concerts, at the Teatro Lyrico Fluminense in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on November 24, 1869, he collapsed from having contracted yellow fever. Just before his collapse, he had finished playing his romantic piece Morte! (translated from Brazilian Portuguese as \\"Death\\"), although the actual collapse occurred just as he started to play his celebrated piece Tremolo. Gottschalk never recovered from the collapse. Three weeks later, on December 18, 1869, at the age of 40, he died at his hotel in Tijuca, Rio de Janeiro, probably from an overdose of quinine. (According to an essay by Jeremy Nicholas for the booklet accompanying the recording \\"Gottschalk Piano Music\\" performed by Philip Martin on the Hyperion label, \\"He died ... of empyema, the result of a ruptured abscess in the abdomen.\\") In 1870, his remains were returned to the United States and were interred at the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York.Wilson, Scott. Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.: 2 (Kindle Locations 18177‚Äì18178). McFarland & Company, Inc., Publishers. Kindle Edition. His burial spot was originally marked by a magnificent marble monument, topped by an \\"Angel of Music\\" statue, which was irreparably damaged by vandals in 1959. In October 2012, after nearly fifteen years of fund raising by the Green-Wood Cemetery, a new \\"Angel of Music\\" statue, created by sculptors Giancarlo Biagi and Jill Burkee to replace the damaged one, was unveiled.  Works  Louis Moreau Gottschalk pictured on an 1864 Publication of The Dying Poet for piano Gottschalk's music was very popular during his lifetime and his earliest compositions created a sensation in Europe. Early pieces like Bamboula, La Savane, Le Bananier and Le Mancenillier were based on Gottschalk's memories of the music he heard during his youth in Louisiana and are widely regarded as the earliest existing pieces of creole music culture. In this context, some of Gottschalk's work, such as the 13-minute opera Escenas campestres, retains a wonderfully innocent sweetness and charm. Gottschalk also utilized the Bamboula theme as a melody in his Symphony No. 1: A Night in the Tropics. Many of his compositions were destroyed after his death, or are lost. Recordings Various pianists later recorded his piano music. The first important recordings of his orchestral music, including the symphony A Night in the Tropics, were made for Vanguard Records by Maurice Abravanel and the Utah Symphony Orchestra. Vox Records issued a multi-disc collection of his music, which was later reissued on CD. This included world premiere recordings of the original orchestrations of both symphonies and other works, which were conducted by Igor Buketoff and Samuel Adler. More recently, Philip Martin has recorded most of the extant piano music for Hyperion Records. In popular culture Author Howard Breslin wrote a historical novel about Gottschalk titled Concert Grand in 1963. An interesting version of Gottschalk's famous composition Bamboula with added lyrics was recorded in April 1934 by trumpet player Abel Beauregard's dance band, the Orchestre Cr√©ole Matou from the French Caribbean Guadeloupe island.Bamboula by Abel Beauregard's Orchestre Cr√©ole Matou is included on Biguine, Anthologie de la tradition musicale antillaise (1930-1954) Volume 4 (Fr√©meaux et Associ√©s). It is actually the first recording in existence of this composition, as the first 'classical piano' recordings of Gottschalk's works were made in 1956 by American pianist Eugene List.The first classical piano recording of Bamboula (Danse Des N√®gres) can be found on the Slavery in America 1914-1972 set with booklet notes by musicologist Bruno Blum.

A Perfect Circle has released four studio albums, the first three during the early 2000s: Mer de Noms, their debut album in 2000, and followed up by Thirteenth Step in 2003; then in 2004, Emotive‚Äîan album of radically re-worked cover songs. Shortly after Emotives release, the band went on hiatus; Keenan returned to Tool and started up solo work under the band name Puscifer. and Howerdel released a solo album, Keep Telling Myself It's Alright, under the moniker Ashes Divide. Band activity was sporadic in the following years; the band reformed in 2010, and played live shows on and off between 2010 and 2013, but fell into inactivity after the release of their greatest hits album, Three Sixty, and a live album box set, A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo in late 2013. The band reformed in 2017 to record a fourth album, Eat the Elephant, which was released on April 20, 2018. Prone to downtime due to Keenan's other musical commitments, the band has featured a variety of musicians throughout alternating periods of activity and inactivity, and has changed line-ups on each album, leaving Keenan and Howerdel the only constant members. The original incarnation of the band included Paz Lenchantin on bass, Troy Van Leeuwen on guitar, and Josh Freese on drums. Primus drummer Tim Alexander had briefly stood in as a drummer prior to Freese in the band's initial live shows; however, this was prior to releasing any material. Band collaborator and producer Danny Lohner and Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White were also members for a short period in the early 2000s. The band's current lineup features Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha, bassist Matt McJunkins, and drummer Jeff Friedl, the latter two also being contributors to the related Puscifer and Ashes Divide projects. Despite the varied cast and numerous lineup changes, the stylistic content of A Perfect Circle's songs has remained consistent with Howerdel as music composer, and Keenan writing lyrics and vocal melodies. The band's studio albums have been generally well received critically and commercially, with their first three studio albums selling 4 million copies collectively as of 2005. History =Formation and Mer de Noms (1999‚Äì2000)= A Perfect Circle logo A Perfect Circle was originally conceived by Billy Howerdel, a former guitar technician for Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins, Fishbone and Tool. Howerdel met singer Maynard James Keenan in 1992, when Tool was opening for Fishbone, and the two became friends. Three years later, Keenan offered Howerdel, who was looking for lodging, a room in his North Hollywood home. This provided Howerdel the opportunity to play demos of his music for Keenan. Pleased with what he heard, Keenan remarked, \\"I can hear myself singing [those songs].\\" Howerdel originally wanted Cocteau Twins lead singer Elizabeth Fraser to be A Perfect Circle's vocalist, but she was unavailable. Howerdel agreed that Keenan would be a good fit, and A Perfect Circle was formed a short time later. The two rounded out the band's initial lineup with bassist and violinist Paz Lenchantin, former Failure guitarist Troy Van Leeuwen, and Primus drummer Tim Alexander. The band played their first show at LA's Viper Club Reception in August 1999, followed by a larger-scale, more widely publicized show at the Coachella Festival that October. While initially in talks to release the album on Volcano Records ‚Äì Tool's record label ‚Äì Keenan stated that they instead chose to go with Virgin Records, who Keenan felt better understood that Keenan meant for the band to be an equally important band to Tool, not a minor side project. After the initial shows and securing a record deal, the band entered the studio to begin work on their first album. Alexander was soon replaced with Josh Freese, who previously worked with Howerdel on the Guns N' Roses album Chinese Democracy, with Alexander's only studio contribution being drums on the album version of the song \\"The Hollow\\". The band's debut album, Mer de Noms (French for \\"Sea of Names\\"), was released on May 23, 2000. The album was well received commercially and critically. It debuted at number four on the Billboard 200, selling 188,000 copies in its first week and making it the highest selling debut album for a rock band. Mer de Noms was later certified platinum by the RIAA, indicating 1 million copies sold, on October 31, 2000. The release earned the band the \\"Best Debut Album\\" award from the California Music Awards. In the album review by Rolling Stone, Pat Blashill wrote that Keenan \\"added an almost operatic angst to Howerdel's songs\\" and concluded that \\"A Perfect Circle sound like a desperate dream of what rock used to be. Maybe that's the point.\\"Blashill, Pat (June 8, 2000). Mer de Noms Album Review. Rolling Stone. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. AllMusic's review expressed that \\"there's little question that the addicting combination of Keenan's aching voice and Howerdel's accomplished songs and production skills made for one of 2000's best splashes in whatever was left of 'modern rock'.\\"Raggett, Ned. [ Review: Mer de Noms]. AllMusic. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. Promotions began shortly after recording for the album was finished. Initially, they served as the opening act for Nine Inch Nails on the 2000 Fragility v2.0 tour, but subsequently embarked on a number of headlining tours all over the world, touring for around eight months straight. As Keenan was well known through his other band, he would often wear long wigs on his otherwise bald head when performing, to distinguish himself from his Tool persona. The album produced three singles as well: \\"Judith\\", \\"3 Libras\\", and \\"The Hollow\\". All three performed well commercially; peaking at fourth, twelfth, and fourteenth on the Billboard Mainstream Rock chart respectively. =Thirteenth Step (2001‚Äì2003)= Activity began slowing down for the band by late 2000, with Keenan returning to Tool to finish the recording of what would be their next album, Lateralus. Keenan returned to A Perfect Circle to tour from January to March 2001, until returning to Tool again for the rest of 2001 to release and tour in support of Lateralus. Initial plans were for Howerdel to collaborate long-distance on writing new A Perfect Circle material with Keenan while he toured with Tool, by sending ideas back and forth to one another, though Keenan found it too difficult to balance both, eventually lessening his role while he focused on Tool. Efforts continued through mid-2002, with Howerdel primarily focusing on writing new material while sporadically working with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese. By June 2002, Van Leeuwen estimated that about 80% of the instrumental material was completed while they waited for Keenan's return. However, lineup changes and disagreements on the album's direction would lead to the album not being released for over a year. Both Lenchantin and Van Leeuwen had been working on solo material during the band's downtime, and then moved on to join other bands. Lenchantin would leave to join Billy Corgan's new start-up band Zwan in April 2002, while Van Leeuwen began touring Queens of the Stone Age shortly after. Ex-Marilyn Manson bassist Jeordie White, formerly known as Twiggy Ramirez, replaced Lenchantin on bass in January 2003. Shortly after, Van Leeuwen permanently left the band, and long-time band collaborator Danny Lohner filled in temporarily as the second guitarist for wrapping up the album. Keenan rejoined the sessions in early 2003, and the music began taking a different direction with the new lineup and Keenan's influence. Beyond the new personnel, the dynamic had changed: With Mer de Noms, Howerdel had already written and finalized all of the music, with Keenan just contributing the lyrics and vocals. This time around, Keenan was more active in vetoing or altering musical ideas, determined to make something different than just another hard rock album, in fear of it being redundant. Sessions became tense, with Howerdel preferring the heavier compositions written while waiting for Keenan to return to the band, and sometimes taking offense to Keenan's suggested mellower rearrangements. White would play the role of a mediator between the two; being newer to the band helped him provide an outsider's perspective, helping them to find a common ground. The band released their second album, Thirteenth Step, on September 16, 2003. The album debuted even higher than Mer de Noms, charting at number 2 in its opening week and selling over 233,000 copies. The album, and its accompanying new sound, fared well critically as well. The AllMusic review praised the band's new sound, describing it as \\"moodier, tenser, and more atmospheric (if that is possible) recording than its predecessor ... The wide dynamic swathes that were so prominent on the band's debut are all but absent here. The squalling guitars have taken a backseat to carefully crafted melodies where atmospherics are maximized and pulled taut over the listener. While not a radical departure from Mer de Noms, there is a real progression here.... Lyrically, musically, sonically, the Thirteenth Step is proof positive that mainstream rock has plenty of life and vision left in it.\\" Touring in support of the album started in the U.S. in July 2003, and ran through the end of the year, with a brief European leg of the tour extending out to Europe with the Deftones in September. Lohner, who could not commit to touring on a full-time permanent basis, was replaced by former The Smashing Pumpkins guitarist James Iha. In January 2004, the group left the country to play shows in Europe, Australia, New Zealand and Japan. They headed back to the U.S. in March and wrapped up touring in June, totaling to about a year straight of touring. Meanwhile, three singles were released from the album: \\"Weak and Powerless\\", \\"The Outsider\\" and \\"Blue\\". \\"Weak and Powerless\\" managed to top the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks and Mainstream Rock Songs, while \\"The Outsider\\" later peaked in the top 5 of both as well. \\"Weak and Powerless\\" and \\"The Outsider\\" were also the band's only songs to have substantial cross-over success, charting on the Billboard Hot 100 all-format chart, at 61 and 79 respectively. =Emotive (2004)= After wrapping up the touring in support of Thirteenth Step in the first half of 2004, the band had announced it planned to enter a long hiatus while Keenan returned to Tool and Howerdel pursued a solo career. In July 2004, Keenan performed at Serj Tankian's (System of a Down) and Tom Morello's (Rage Against the Machine) Axis of Justice concert ‚Äì an event for musicians to advocate for political and social causes. At the performance, Keenan announced that A Perfect Circle would be releasing a collection of political cover songs. During the beginning of the touring cycle for Thirteenth Step, Howerdel and Keenan discussed potential ideas for a third studio album. An early idea was to record an album of cover songs, though they were initially hesitant, feeling they needed a meaningful reason to warrant doing it. Keenan, who had been very critical of President George W. Bush during the touring cycle, proposed tying the concept together as a political-themed covers album, with Howerdel, while generally apolitical publicly, felt was worth pursuing in their post-September 11th attacks political and social climate. The two put their plans on hold temporarily and decided to move forward on the project as the band's third studio album. Keenan emphasized that, despite his personal feelings on Bush, the album was less of an \\"anti-Bush\\" album, and more of a \\"anti-political apathy\\" ‚Äì encouraging people to research things and become more involved. The band rushed to complete the album in time to release it prior to the 2004 U.S. Presidential Elections in November, just barely a year after their prior release. Recording sessions ran from late June to early September. The sessions, largely the work of Howerdel, Keenan, and Freese, contained contributions from past and present members of the band, including Lenchantin, Lohner, White, and Iha.Emotive album liner notes Keenan, aware of the time constraints and Howerdel's future intentions on doing solo albums, also encouraged Howerdel to contribute lead vocals to about a third of the album. A wide variety of different songs were chosen to be recorded, from Marvin Gaye's \\"What's Going On\\" to Led Zeppelin's \\"When the Levee Breaks\\". Most songs were radical reinterpretations of the original, sometimes unrecognizable compared to the originals. Howerdel explained that it was done on purpose, to make the song's their own, and conceded that he, as of 2010, still had not even once ever heard the original version of Crucifix's \\"Annihilation\\", another song re-recorded for the album. He also stated that some songs had started as original A Perfect Circle songs musically, until the band decided to use the lyrics of other songs over the compositions, in turn converting them into cover songs. The band's third album, Emotive, was released on November 2, 2004 ‚Äì the actual U.S Presidential Election Day. However, the album received a much more polarizing reception than the prior two albums, with some critics and fans not appreciating the band's move into more political content, or the radical liberties they had taken with the album's cover versions. Others accused the band of rushing out a third album in order to fulfill the band's three album contractual obligation to Virgin Records, a claim refuted as false by Howerdel. The album still managed to receive a generally positive reception from critics. Sales were similarly positive, but less so than prior albums. The position debuted at number 2 on the Billboard 200 charts, selling 142,000 copies in its first week ‚Äì matching Thirteenth Step's peak chart placement, but selling almost 90,000 copies less. The album was certified Gold by the RIAA, indicating 500,000 units sold. The band did not tour in support of the release, instead entering a hiatus shortly after its completion. Two singles were released in support of the album, the first of which was a somber cover of John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" The second single, \\"Passive\\", was one of just two original songs on the album, tracing back to writing sessions for Trent Reznor's unreleased Tapeworm project. In the late 1990s, Reznor started the project for songs that did not fit Nine Inch Nails, which eventually grew into a collaborative project with a number of other musicians. One track, \\"Vacant\\", featured contributions from Keenan and Lohner in 1999, but with the project hitting development hell due to creative and legal hurdles of many of the participants in the early 2000s, A Perfect Circle began playing the track at live shows. With the project being shelved completely by 2004, Keenan decided to rework the track as \\"Passive\\" for Emotive. Additionally, two weeks after the release of the album release, on November 16, 2004, the band released the CD/DVD compilation set entitled Amotion. The DVD part contained the music videos for band six singles; while the CD is composed entirely of remixes of the singles from Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step. =Hiatus and other projects (2005‚Äì2009)= The band entered a hiatus in January 2005, with members turning to their own separate projects. Keenan rejoined Tool to record what would be 2006's 10,000 Days, Howerdel began pursuing a solo career, and the rest joined various other touring or sessions recording roles. The band's fate remained uncertain in the following years. It was referred to as \\"hiatus or done until further notice\\" by Howerdel in October 2005, on \\"life-support\\" by Keenan in April 2006, and \\"done for now\\" by Howerdel in May 2006. Towards the end of 2007, Keenan spoke more optimistically about the band reforming someday, but felt that it would probably be in a more limited capacity ‚Äì for a tour or a new single release, not another full-length studio album. Keenan explained: During the time, Howerdel continued to work on projects with various past A Perfect Circle members. In 2005, he wrote and composed the soundtrack to Jak X: Combat Racing, collaborating with Van Leeuwen, Lenchantin, and Freese on a number of tracks. Howerdel continued to work on recording a solo album from 2005 through 2007; the sessions were difficult, so he eventually began collaborating with past A Perfect Circle members, including Lohner as a producer, Freese as a drummer, and Lenchantin as a co-writer for a track. The material was eventually released under the name Ashes Divide on the album Keep Telling Myself It's Alright in early 2008. Meanwhile, Keenan had moved on from working with Tool, and started up a solo-project of sorts on his own, called Puscifer, of which he began releasing studio albums for in 2007. Despite both projects going, both Keenan and Howerdel released statements in 2008 that the band was not dead. =Reformation, touring, compilation releases (2010‚Äì2016)= As early as December 2008, Keenan had mentioned that he and Howerdel had passively and separately been writing new material for A Perfect Circle,(December 9, 2008). \\"New Music From A PERFECT CIRCLE On The Way? \\". blabbermouth.net. Retrieved on 2008-12-12. although the band would officially remain in hiatus and largely out of the view of the public through mid-2010. The turning point was an unexpected collaboration between Keenan and Howerdel; Keenan was scheduled to perform a rendition of \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" with Queen guitarist Brian May in June at E3 2010, but May had to cancel at the last minute. In need of a guitarist, and knowing Howerdel was in the area, Keenan reached out, and had Howerdel play guitar for the performance at the last minute. Despite little time to prepare, the performance was a success, and afterwards, both felt more compelled to perform together again. In September, the band officially announced the end of their hiatus, indicating they would again return to live performances. Keenan, Howerdel, Freese, and Iha all returned to their respective roles, though, with Lenchantin and White unavailable, the band recruited Matt McJunkins, touring bassist for Ashes Divide and Puscifer, to join as bassist. The performances, running through the end of 2010, included traveling to five separate cities for three nights of shows in each city, with each night containing a complete, in-order performance of one of each of their three albums ‚Äì Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive ‚Äì notably being the first time most of the material from the latter had ever been performed live. Throughout the year the band would discuss the prospect of new material, but with uncertainty. Keenan continued to insist that logistics and industry trends made recording another full album unlikely, and that single one-off songs would be more likely. Howerdel noted that he had been writing material and presenting rough demos to Keenan since 2008, but that much of the material was in a state of flux, some being accepted by Keenan as potential A Perfect Circle material, while other being rejected by Keenan, and/or saved by Howerdel for a prospective Ashes Divide release in the future.Cogill, Kevin (September 24, 2010). \\"Reconnecting with A Perfect Circle\\". antiquiet.com. Retrieved on November 21, 2010. The band continued their live performances into 2011, including a North American tour that spanned May through August. Notable events included Rock on the Range, Edgefest, Bluesfest, Kanrocksas Music Festival, Lollapalooza, a performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre. Freese, who had already committed to drumming for Weezer during the same time-frame, was only able to perform at the opening show, and was replaced by Jeff Friedl for the remainder of the shows, who, like McJunkins, had previously worked with both Ashes divide and Puscifer. Keenan and Howerdel continued to allude to recording new music, but continued to state that the process was slow, the logistics of money and availability made it difficult, and that a full album was still unlikely, in favor of single songs instead. Only one new song, \\"By and Down\\", was performed at the shows. By the end of the year, Keenan revealed that none of the material was ready for release, and that moving into 2012, he and Howerdel were moving back into their respective other projects ‚Äì Puscifer and Ashes Divide. The band was inactive over the course of 2012, outside of a single live show in December. However, just prior to the show, in October 2012, Freese announced he would be permanently leaving the band, with Friedl becoming his permanent replacement. The band played a few live shows in early 2013, including Soundwave Music Festival in Australia and Lollapalooza Chile, though Keenan reported that they had still yet to complete any new tracks due to their other commitments. Later in the year, the band announced two separate compilation releases for November 2013. The first, a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, containing one new studio recording, \\"By and Down\\", and the second, a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and Echo. The box set contained four CDs of live music: one for each of their three entire-album performances of Mer de Noms, Thirteenth Step, and Emotive done in 2010, collectively dubbed Trifecta, and a recording of their 2011 performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, dubbed Stone and Echo. The set also came with DVD video recording of the 2011 Stone and Echo performance. In promoting the releases, Howerdel commented on future releases once again, stating that he felt they had \\"75% of the foundation of [the next] A Perfect Circle record ready\\", though he conceded that they were still without Keenan's lyrics or vocal melodies, and could still change depending on Keenan's reaction to the material. He also conceded that they still disagreed on the release medium; Keenan preferred smaller releases, while Howerdel preferred the format of a full album. Shortly after, the band again fell into a few years of public inactivity, with little occurring outside of Howerdel's 2015 commentary reiterating his commitment to the band, and Keenan's early 2016 commentary reiterating he still hoped to return to the band. =Eat the Elephant (2017‚Äìpresent)= A Perfect Circle performing at alt=A group of musicians performing on stage in front of a crowd. The band became active again in 2017, with the announcement that they would reform to embark on a North American tour in April and May 2017, with the intention of using the live performances of new material as motivation to finish recording the album, similar to how they had embarked on their first 1999 tour to inspire the completion of Mer de Noms. In March, the band announced they had signed a new record contract ‚Äì their first in thirteen years ‚Äì to release a fourth full-length studio album through BMG Rights Management. Howerdel initially gave a tentative timeframe of between November 2017 to early 2018 for the new album, while Keenan stated that the album wouldn't be out in 2017. A second North American tour began in October, and runs through December 2017. The band continued to debut new songs during the tours, including the tracks \\"Feathers\\" and \\"Hourglass\\". The band's fourth studio album, Eat the Elephant, was released on April 20, 2018. Four singles were released in advance of the album; \\"The Doomed\\" in October 2017, \\"Disillusioned\\" in January 2018, \\"TalkTalk\\" in February 2018 and \\"So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish\\" in April 2018. The album marks the first time the band opted to work with an outside music producer: Dave Sardy. Sardy helped Keenan and Howerdel find common ground in musical ideas in the recording process, helping them find a path to move forward in finishing the album. The band toured extensively in 2018 in support of the album, including performances at Rock on the Range and Coachella. In June 2018, the band extended their touring with a new North American leg towards the end of the year, and released a 2D hologram video for the song \\"The Contrarian\\".https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/watch-a-perfect-circles- creepy-the-contrarian-video-w521359 Iha was unavailable to perform in the April through July performances due to his commitment to the Smashing Pumpkin's 2018 reunion, and was temporarily replaced for the live performances by Greg Edwards of Failure, though Iha still remains a member of the band. Howerdel noted that he would like to see the band keep active beyond the Eat the Elephant album cycle, but that future activity, as it had historically been, is dependent on Keenan's limited availability and commitments to his other projects. When asked about if there would be further albums, in June 2018, Keenan responded \\"Yeah, there should be\\".https://www.eonmusic.co.uk/a-perfect-circle-maynard-james-keenan-eonmusic- interview-june-2018.html Howerdel was optimistic in November 2018 as well, agreeing that the band ‚Äúwill move forward for sure‚Äù.http://loudwire.com/a-perfect-circle-billy-howerdel-band-future-we-will- move-forward-for-sure/ Musical style, influences and legacy The band's music has been described as a number of different genres, though despite the sound changes and lineup changes, the writing process has remained the same for the band; Howerdel primarily writes the band's instrumental music, while Keenan contributes the lyrics and vocal melodies. Keenan, already very well known for his work with fronting the band Tool through the 1990s, always strove to keep the sound of two bands different: Howerdel has similarly described A Perfect Circle as a more emotional, vulnerable, and feminine approach to music than Tool. He has cited among his influences, several albums that had a strong effect on his way of playing: Adam Ant's Kings of the Wild Frontier, for its \\"weird hybrid of pirate music and American Indian influence\\", Siouxsie and the Banshees' Tinderbox as \\"one of the spookiest records I've ever heard\\" and for its \\"dense atmosphere\\", Ozzy Osbourne's Diary of a Madman as \\"Randy Rhoads has been a huge influence for me, especially when I was starting out\\" and finally the Cure's Pornography, which he described as \\"another spooky atmospheric record\\" and \\"one of the scariest albums I've ever heard\\". Tracy Frey of AllMusic described the band's sound as \\"an extension of the alt-metal-fused-with-art rock style popularized by Tool in the early to mid-'90s. While similar to Tool in intensity and melancholy, A Perfect Circle is less dark and more melodic, with a theatrical, ambient quality that incorporates occasional strings and unusual instrumentation. While Keenan referred to the band first album, Mer de Noms, as more of a hard rock album, for subsequent albums, out of fear of redundancy, he often pushed for a more mellow, atmospheric sound, something he and Howerdel did not always see eye to eye on, creating a sound noted to be similar to merging heavy rock music with Disintegration-era The Cure music. In general, common genre classifications applied to labeling the band's music include alternative rock, alternative metal, hard rock, art rock, art metal, progressive rock and progressive metal. The band has also been lumped in with the nu metal genre, a label that is cited due to the band's rise to fame coinciding with the genre's movement towards more melodic heavy material similar to A Perfect Circle's sound, and its use was contested by many publications. Both A Perfect Circle and Tool have been widely hailed as major influences on modern rock. In a 2015 retrospective, VH1 noted that, \\"at some point sounding like Tool became a subgenre of rock. Although that is a little misleading as many of these bands were actually ripping off A Perfect Circle, because of its easier-to-grasp melody and simpler rhythms.\\" Reviewers from outlets such as AllMusic and Rolling Stone cited Mer de Noms and Thirteenth Step as rare examples of relevance and quality in contemporary rock music. Online music magazine musicOMH asserted the band had \\"literally defined alternative rock as we know it.\\" Band members Current members * Maynard James Keenan ‚Äì lead vocals (1999‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äìpresent) * Billy Howerdel ‚Äì lead guitar, keyboards, backing vocals, bass (studio only) (1999‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äìpresent) * James Iha ‚Äì rhythm guitar, keyboards (2003‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äìpresent) * Matt McJunkins ‚Äì bass, backing vocals (2010‚Äìpresent) * Jeff Friedl ‚Äì drums (2011‚Äìpresent) Touring members * Greg Edwards ‚Äì rhythm guitar, keyboards (2018‚Äìpresent) Former members * Troy Van Leeuwen ‚Äì rhythm guitar (1999‚Äì2002) * Tim Alexander ‚Äì drums (1999) * Josh Freese ‚Äì drums (1999‚Äì2004, 2010‚Äì2011) * Danny Lohner ‚Äì rhythm guitar (2003, 2004) * Paz Lenchantin ‚Äì bass, strings, backing vocals (1999‚Äì2002, 2004) * Jeordie White ‚Äì bass (2003‚Äì2004) =Timeline= Discography * Mer de Noms (2000) * Thirteenth Step (2003) * Emotive (2004) * Eat the Elephant (2018) References External links * Category:1999 establishments in California Category:Alternative metal supergroups Category:Alternative rock groups from California Category:American alternative metal musical groups Category:Art rock musical groups Category:Articles which contain graphical timelines Category:Hard rock musical groups from California Category:EMI Records artists Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:Musical groups disestablished in 2004 Category:Musical groups reestablished in 2010 Category:Musical quintets Category:Nu metal musical groups from California Category:Progressive rock musical groups from California Category:Virgin Records artists ","title":"A Perfect Circle"},{"id":"269860","text":"Carl William Mays (November 12, 1891 - April 4, 1971) was an American baseball pitcher who played 15 seasons in Major League Baseball from 1915 to 1929. During his career, he won over 200 games, 27 in 1921 alone, and was a member of four World Series-champion teams. Mays is also remembered for throwing the pitch that fatally injured Ray Chapman of the Cleveland Indians on August 16, 1920. Chapman became the only Major League player to die as a direct result of an on-field injury.Carl Mays: My Pitch That Killed Chapman Was A Strike! by Phyllis Propert, Baseball Digest, July 1957, Vol. 16, No. 6, \\"The Death of Ray Chapman\\", The New York Times, August 17, 1920 Playing career According to his World War I draft card, Carl William Mays was born November 12, 1891, in Atterson, Kentucky, one of five sons born to Callie Louisa Mays and William Henry Mays. His father was a Methodist minister, and was responsible for his strict religious upbringing. When Mays was 12, his father died and his mother moved the family to Kingfisher, Oklahoma, to live near her sister-in-law. Mays internalized his grief, settling into a surly persona with few if any close friends. His best personal support group was a couple named Pierce and Genevieve Mays, who were relatives, and served as a surrogate uncle and aunt.Deveney, Sean. The Original Curse (McGraw-Hill, 2010), pp. 146‚Äì157. As a professional baseball player, he had few friends in the baseball world. In part because of his strict Methodist upbringing, Mays refused to pitch on Sundays, as did legendary pitcher Christy Mathewson. Mays quit high school before graduating and began to earn a living as a baseball player on semi-pro teams in Oklahoma, Kansas, and Utah. In 1912, he entered the minor leagues as a member of the Boise, Idaho, team in the Class D Western Tri-State League. After a season in Boise, in 1913 Mays played one season for the Portland, Oregon, team in the Class A Northwest League. In 1914, Mays was drafted by the Triple-A International League's Providence Grays. The Grays were an affiliate of the Detroit Tigers, and the Tigers sold his contract to the Boston Red Sox. In one version of the story, Mays learned his underhand style of pitching from Dizzy Dismukes, a pitcher in Negro league baseball. In another, he was taught the technique by Joe McGinnity when McGinnity coached the Tacoma team during Mays's stint with Portland. Mays was nicknamed \\"Sub\\", a reference to his submarine pitching motion, and he was known to throw a spitball. The pitch was legal at the time of the Chapman incident, but Chapman's death was partly responsible for its ban in Major League Baseball. Mays was also known for a habit of throwing inside to any batter who hugged the plate; despite a stellar win/loss record, he was typically among the American League leaders in hit batsmen. Mays was also regarded as an exceptional fielder, and was capable enough with the bat that he was often used as a pinch-hitter. Mays in a batting stance at the Polo Grounds some time during 1919-1922\\\\. In his rookie season of 1915, Mays appeared in 34 games for the Red Sox. Used mostly in relief, he won 6 games and lost 5. During the regular season, Mays was involved in a heated confrontation with Ty Cobb of the Tigers. Mays threw near Cobb each time he came to bat. In the eighth inning, after another close pitch, Cobb threw his bat in Mays' direction, calling him a \\"no good son of a bitch\\". Mays responded by calling Cobb a \\"yellow dog\\". After order was restored, Mays hit Cobb directly on the wrist. The Tigers won the game 6‚Äì1 and the incident cemented Mays' reputation as a head hunter. The Red Sox won that year's World Series by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies in five games, but Mays did not play. In 1916, Mays appeared in 44 games, and started 24. 18 of his starts were complete games, and he posted a record of 18 wins and 13 losses, with an earned run average of 2.39. In the 1916 World Series, Mays was the losing pitcher in Game 3, but the Red Sox defeated the Brooklyn Robins 4 games to 1. In 1917, The Red Sox posted a second place finish. Mays pitched in 35 games, and his record was 22 wins and 9 losses, with an ERA of 1.74. Mays went 22‚Äì13 in the 1918 season, with an ERA of 2.21. The Red Sox returned to the World Series, and defeated the Chicago Cubs in 6 games. Mays was the winning pitcher in games 3 and 6, both by scores of 2‚Äì1. Mays married for the first time shortly after the end of the 1918 season. After a brief honeymoon in Missouri, he departed by train from his home in Mansfield for St. Louis as the leader of a group of 18 men who had enlisted in the United States Army for World War I. They were sworn in on November 6, five days before the Armistice that ended that war. Influenza broke out while Mays was stationed at Washington University in St. Louis as a member of the Student Army Training Corps's vocational training unit, and several individuals from his train trip died during the outbreak. The Armistice ended the need to expand the Army, and Mays was discharged in time to begin the 1919 baseball season. Though he was by now established as one of the game's premier pitchers, Mays began the 1919 season with a record of five wins and eleven losses. His slow start resulted in the Red Sox trading him to the New York Yankees that July. Mays went 9‚Äì3 after the trade, resulting in a combined 1919 record of 14‚Äì14. Mays regained his form in 1920. The Yankees finished in third place, but posted a record of 95 wins and 59 losses, only three games out of first place. Mays went 26‚Äì11, including 26 complete games. Death of Ray Chapman The Yankees were trailing the Indians when Ray Chapman came to the plate in the fifth inning on August 16, 1920. Mays was pursuing his 100th career win that day. Chapman had a sacrifice bunt in the first inning and popped up to Yankee first baseman Wally Pipp in the third. Angered that Chapman was crowding the plate, Mays let loose with a high fastball that he claimed was in the strike zone but that Chapman apparently never saw. The impact of the ball striking Chapman in the head was so loud that Mays, thinking it had hit Chapman's bat and was in play, caught the ball as it bounced onto the field and threw it to Pipp at first base. Chapman, trying to take his base after the hit by pitch, fell to the ground twice and was unable to get up. Cleveland teammate Tris Speaker raced from the on deck circle to check on Chapman. He was joined by several players from the Indians and Yankees. Mays, however, never left the mound. Chapman was taken to a hospital, where surgeons operated and discovered a skull fracture. He initially seemed to rally after the surgery but died early in the morning on the following day. Mays stayed in the game and continued to pitch until being replaced in the ninth inning. Cleveland won the game 4‚Äì3. The New York District Attorney determined that the incident was an accident, and no charges were filed.Ron Elliot, Historic Kentucky People and Places, Ray Chapman's Last Time at Bat, Courtesy of Carl Mays, accessed January 31, 2013 In an interview three months after Chapman's death, Mays expressed regret for the outcome, but stated that he did not feel any guilt because he had not hit Chapman on purpose. Mays received the wrath of many opposing players, who believed he blamed Chapman. Ty Cobb was the most vocal critic, suggesting that someone should give Mays a taste of his own medicine by hitting Mays with a pitch the same way Mays hit Chapman. Later career Mays enjoyed his best season in 1921, when he led the American League in wins (27), innings pitched (336.2), games pitched (49), and winning percentage (.750). However, that same season Mays, pitching then for the Yankees, played in a World Series that others later accused him of helping to throw, bringing back memories of the Black Sox scandal from just two years prior. These rumors were never proven, but they persisted long enough that, combined with an already negative reputation among other players both from the Chapman incident and from having a personality that few found agreeable, he was never elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame despite having lifetime statistics comparable to some other pitchers who were.\\"Tragic Pitch Recalled By Carl Mays\\", by Jack Murphy, Baseball Digest, May 1971, Vol. 30, No. 5, In a 15-year career with the Boston Red Sox, New York Yankees, Cincinnati Reds, and New York Giants, Mays compiled a 207‚Äì126 record with 29 shutouts, 862 strikeouts and a 2.92 earned run average when the league average was 3.48. He won twenty or more games five times. He was also noted for his skills with a bat, hitting five home runs, recording 110 runs batted in, and sporting a lifetime .268 batting average--an unusually high mark for a pitcher. Mays is the only Red Sox pitcher to toss two nine-inning complete game victories on the same day, as he bested the Philadelphia Athletics 12‚Äì0 and 4‚Äì1 on August 30, 1918. Those wins put the Red Sox one step from clinching the league championship, as they led Cleveland by 3 1/2 games with 4 remaining to play. Later years After his playing career, Mays was the owner and operator of a baseball school in Oregon; among his most notable attendees was Johnny Pesky. Mays also worked as a scout for the Cleveland Indians, Milwaukee and Atlanta Braves, and Kansas City Royals. In addition, his stepson, Jerry Bartow, coached baseball at Hoover High School in San Diego, and each spring Mays made the trip from Oregon to volunteer as a mentor and assistant coach. In an interview, Mays said he especially enjoyed working with young pitchers, but that he regarded his most important task as teaching members of the team how to play the game safely. He died in El Cajon, California, and is buried in River View Cemetery, Portland, Oregon (Sec. 13, Lot 49, Sp. 7). His distant cousin, Joe Mays, was a Major League pitcher from 1999 to 2006. Family After the 1918 World Series, Mays married Marjorie Fredricka Madden, a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music whom he had met during his rookie season. They were the parents of two children, Carl Jr. (1925‚Äì2017) and Elizabeth (Betty). He was survived by his second wife, Esther Ugstead (1907‚Äì1990). Legacy In August 2008, Mays was one of the 10 former players who began their careers before 1943 to be considered by the Veterans Committee for induction into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. He was named on only about 25 percent of the ballots, so he was not selected for induction. Further reading The book The Pitch That Killed, by Mike Sowell, is a history of the Chapman-Mays events. The historical novel, The Curse of Carl Mays, by Howard Camerik, also recounts the history of the incident. The children's book, Ray and Me by Dan Gutman, tells of Joe Stoshack and his journey to save Ray's life from Mays' \\"killer\\" pitch. The book 1921: The Yankees, the Giants, and the Battle for Baseball Supremacy in New York by Lyle Spatz, Steve Steinberg, Charles C. Alexander, takes a look at how Mays had social problems with his teammates and how that actually led him to be sold to the Yankees from the Red Sox.

Today there are organizations, called schools, in over 30 countries which are attended by more than 150,000 people each year. Outward Bound International is a non-profit membership and licensing organisation for the international network of Outward Bound schools. The Outward Bound Trust is an educational charity established in 1946 to operate the schools in the United Kingdom. Separate organizations operate the schools in each of the other countries in which Outward Bound operates. Outward Bound helped to shape the U.S. Peace Corps and numerous other outdoor adventure programs. Its aim is to foster the personal growth and social skills of participants by using challenging expeditions in the outdoors. History The first Outward Bound school was opened in Aberdyfi, Wales in 1941 by Lawrence Holt and Kurt Hahn with financial support from the Blue Funnel Line shipping company.Outward Bound International (2004). Birth of Outward Bound . Retrieved 9 December 2007. The name Outward Bound was derived from the nautical term for a ship leaving safe harbour for the open sea. Outward Bound grew out of Hahn's work in the development of the Gordonstoun school and what is now known as the Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Outward Bound's founding mission was to improve the survival chances of young seamen after their ships were torpedoed in the mid-Atlantic. James Martin Hogan served as warden for the first year of the school.Outward Bound Wales, Aberdyfi. Retrieved 29 August 2008. This mission was established and then expanded by Capt. J. F. 'Freddy' Fuller who took over the leadership of the Aberdyfi school in 1942 and served the Outward Bound movement as senior warden until 1971.James, David, (1957) \\"Outward Bound\\" Routledge and Kegan Paul, London. Fuller had been seconded from the Blue Funnel Line following wartime experience during the Battle of the Atlantic of surviving two successive torpedo attacks and commanding an open lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for thirty-five days without losing a single member of the crew. An educational charity, named The Outward Bound Trust, was established in 1946 to operate the school. A second school followed in England at Eskdale Green in 1950. The first Outward Bound program for women was held in 1951. During the next decade, several other schools opened around the United Kingdom. A school in Lumut, Malaysia opened in 1954, the first outside the United Kingdom. Outward Bound Australia was founded in 1956. The first Outward Bound USA course was run in 1961 for the Peace Corps, which it helped to shape. Outward Bound New Zealand was founded in 1962 and Outward Bound Singapore established in 1967. From the inception of Outward Bound, community service was an integral part of the program, especially in the areas of sea and mountain rescues and this remains an important part of the training for both staff and students. During the period 1941 to 1965 in the United Kingdom, the philosophy of the schools evolved from ‚Äòcharacter‚Äêtraining‚Äô to ‚Äòpersonal growth‚Äô and ‚Äòself‚Äêdiscovery‚Äô. Aberdyfi remains the organisation's \\"nerve-centre\\" in the United Kingdom. Over the course of a summer in 2010, 7-8,000 students attended courses at the Aberdyfi centre and more than a million young people have attended Outward Bound courses in the UK since 1941. Outward Bound International was founded as a non-profit organization in 2004 to license the use of the brand name 'Outward Bound' and to provide support for the international network of schools. Today there are organizations, called schools, in more than 30 countries with 250 wilderness and urban locations around the world which are attended by more than 150,000 people each year. Separate organizations operate the schools in each of the other countries in which Outward Bound operates. Name Blue Peter nautical flag indicates that a vessel is \\"outward bound\\". Outward Bound schools use and raise this flag to symbolise the journey starting for OB students at the start of a programme. The name Outward Bound derives from a nautical expression that refers to the moment a ship leaves the harbour. This is signified by Outward Bound's use of the nautical flag, the Blue Peter (a white square inside a blue square). JF Fuller adapted the Outward Bound motto, \\"To Serve, To Strive and not To Yield,\\" from the poem \\"Ulysses\\" by Alfred Lord Tennyson: ... Come, my friends. Tis not too late to seek a newer world. Though much is taken, much abides; and though We are not now that strength which in old days Moved earth and heaven, that which we are, we are -- One equal temper of heroic hearts, Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield. Current Since its founding in the middle of the last century, Outward Bound has encouraged individuals to test their physical and emotional limits in challenging outdoor adventure programs. The experiences are a means of building inner strength and a heightened awareness of human interdependence.Outward Bound USA: Crew not Passengers, Josh Miner and Joe Boldt (Seattle: The Mountaineer Books, 2002) Outward Bound operates more than 30 schools in various countries and reports serving over 250,000 students each year. The Compass Rose serves as the logo for almost all the schools around the world.  Course specifics  An Outward Bound excursion at Lake Superior Provincial Park, Ontario, Canada Outward Bound courses follow a kind of recipe or formula, termed the Outward Bound Process Model which is well described by Walsh and Golins (1976) as:Walsh, V., & Golins, G. L. (1976). The exploration of the Outward Bound process. Denver, CO: Colorado Outward Bound School. # Taking a ready, motivated learner # into a prescribed, unfamiliar physical environment, # along with a small group of people # who are faced with a series of incremental, inter-related problem-solving tasks # which creates in the individual a state of dissonance requiring adaptive coping and # leads to a sense of mastery or competence when equilibrium is managed. # The cumulative effect of these experiences leads to a reorganisation of the self-conceptions and information the learner holds about him/herself. # The learner will then continue to be positively oriented to further learning and development experiences (transfer). In a typical class, participants are divided into small patrols (or groups) under the guidance of one or more instructors. The first few days, often at a base camp, are spent training for the outdoor education activities that the course will contain and in the philosophy of Outward Bound. After initial confidence-building challenges, the group heads off on an expedition. As the group develops the capacity to do so, the instructors ask the group to make its own decisions.

Critical reception Reception to the book was mostly positive, with critics applauding its style, ambition, and riskiness; the New York Times described it as \\"the stuff of several books crammed into one long, dense narrative about contemporary urban America\\". Negative criticism focused on a perceived lack of focus, and an attempt to interweave too many plot threads‚Äîthe Los Angeles Times noted that \\"Franzen writes beautifully for the most part, though sometimes to excess\\".

The book describes the characters of Trainspotting ten years after the events of the earlier book, as their paths cross again, this time with the pornography business as the backdrop rather than heroin use (although numerous drugs, particularly cocaine are mentioned throughout). A number of characters from Glue make an appearance as well. This sequel picks up ideas of the film adaptation of Trainspotting. One example is the fact that \\"Spud\\" has received his share of the drug money, which is shown in the film, but only alluded to in the book. Plot summary The novel is divided into three sections, each of which comprises chapters with different narrators. Unlike Trainspotting which had more narrational diversity, Porno is reduced to just five narrators: Sick Boy, Renton, Spud, Begbie and Nikki. Another difference from the format of Trainspotting is that each character has a defined chapter heading depending on what chapter it is. For instance, Sick Boy's chapters all begin with \\"Scam...\\" and then a number in front of a \\"#\\". Renton's all begin with \\"Whores of Amsterdam Pt...\\" Spud's chapters are just narrative, Begbie's are in capitals, and Nikki's are quotes from the chapter, for example \\"...A SIMON DAVID WILLIAMSON PRODUCTION...\\". Each narrator is associated with a distinctive prose style. Renton, Sick Boy, and Nikki's chapters are written almost entirely in \\"standard\\" English while Begbie and Spud's chapters are in Scots. For example, in Chapter 25, Spud narrates, \\"So ah'm downcast git intae the library, thinkin tae masel\\" (\\"So I'm downcast when I get into the library thinking to myself\\"). He also repeats certain words when talking such as \\"catboy\\" or \\"cat\\", \\"likes\\" or \\"likesay\\", and \\"ken?\\" Begbie often swears a lot during his chapters. Sick Boy's returning grandiose nature is featured in imagined interviews with John Gibson of the Evening News and Alex McLeish. =Section 1: Stag= Simon 'Sick Boy' Williamson leaves the London crack scene and returns to Leith when he comes into ownership of his aunt's pub. Convinced that the area is destined to become a social and cultural hub, Simon decides to focus his energy into making the pub an upper class establishment. Nikki Fuller-Smith is a university student who works part-time in a massage parlour. Rab, a university acquaintance, introduces her to his friend Terry Lawson and his underground, home-made pornography operation. The scene interests Nikki. Danny 'Spud' Murphy has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. His relationship with his partner Alison is estranged and Spud feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his life insurance policy and contemplates suicide. Meanwhile, in Amsterdam, Mark Renton is co-owner of a successful nightclub. One night, a DJ from his hometown (Carl Ewart from Welsh's previous novel Glue) plays at one of his clubs and recognises him. When Sick Boy learns of Terry's operation, he offers the use of the upstairs bar to shoot some scenes. During their first meeting, the group begins planning to shoot a full length adult film. The first section concludes with \\"OOTSIDE\\", a chapter noting the release into society of Francis Begbie. =Section 2: Porno= While in prison, Begbie received anonymous packages of gay porn sent from Sick Boy. He was determined to find the culprit upon his release. While accompanying an old friend on a debt collection errand, he meets Kate and begins a relationship with her. When Alison begins working at Sick Boy's pub and Sick Boy deliberately attempts to end her relationship with Spud, the friendship between Spud and Sick Boy is over. During one heated argument, Spud reveals that he received his share of the money from Renton. He also unveils his recent ambition, to write a history of Leith. Begbie visits Sick Boy's pub. As the two converse, Sick Boy considers the merciless trait of opportunity and threat accompanying Begbie's release. Soon after, Terry, Rab and several other friends arrive and begin discussing their upcoming road trip to Amsterdam, a bachelor celebration for Rab. Sick Boy is initially reluctant to attend but changes his mind after Carl, a DJ, mentions that Renton works at a club there. =Section 3: Exhibition= Sick Boy's \\"Porno\\" shoot becomes a slow demolition of his so- called mates. Spud ends their friendship when Sick Boy tells him he was using him for the purpose of a scam, Nikki becomes disillusioned with him after realising that he really has no loving side and really is the cold-hearted, deceitful man that she tried desperately to ignore. Begbie grows tired of Sick Boy being 'smarmy', although Begbie becomes angry with everyone in due course. Spud tries to provoke Begbie into killing him so his wife Alison will profit from his life insurance. As Begbie is angrily beating Spud, Alison and the couple's young son burst in, stopping them. Spud is severely injured, but his last narration implies that he can see life getting better. The biggest departure Sick Boy has from his life is Renton. After promising to meet Sick Boy in Cannes, Renton instead goes to Zurich to empty their joint account and then start a new life in San Francisco. This deception is the biggest blow to Sick Boy as he obviously treasured their unconventional friendship and cannot believe he was tricked by Renton again. Begbie later discovers Renton while visiting Leith and is hit by a car while running across the road to assault him. While Renton would have expected to feel happy by this he is heartbroken and comforts Begbie while he is taken to hospital. It is indicated that as Begbie slips into a coma he may have forgiven Renton. After learning that Begbie has fallen into a coma, Renton flees the country with Nikki and Diane, as well as Sick Boy's ¬£60,000 made from a financial fraud. The book ends with Begbie suddenly coming awake as Sick Boy confesses everything in hope that Begbie will resume his bloodthirsty hunt for Renton. Main characters *Simon David \\"Sick Boy\\" Williamson - hurt by a string of failed business ventures, decides to make a porn film. A heavy cocaine user. Still furious about being ripped off by Renton in the previous novel. In the years since Trainspotting he had a son with a woman who is now his ex-wife. He has also lost some of the charm and physical attractiveness he previously possessed. *Mark \\"Rents\\" Renton - kicked heroin and owns a successful nightclub in Amsterdam. Agrees to finance Sick Boy's porn film in exchange for a share of the profits, despite a mutual lack of trust and love. Has got into shape and learned martial arts in anticipation and fear of an eventual meeting with Begbie. *Nikki Fuller-Smith - an English 25-year old university student and film studies major who moonlights performing minor sexual favours at a sauna/massage parlour. Has body image problems (she occasionally vomits after meals) and is attracted to Sick Boy. She decides to help Sick Boy with his film by starring in it. *Terry Lawson - a self-centred womanizer, his sexual exploits find him involved in the local dogging / amateur pornography scene, into which Rab introduces Nikki, becoming the star of Seven Rides. *Rab Birrell - brother of Billy Birrell and a college mate of Nikki also on her Film Studies course - and fuels the idea of exploiting the girls from Terry's pub, and Nikki's knowledge of film and pornography. *Danny \\"Spud\\" Murphy - after receiving his share of the drug money he has been regularly attending group sessions in an attempt to kick his drug habit. Is in an estranged relationship with Alison (a character who was in an on / off relationship with Sick Boy in Trainspotting) and feels like he has become a burden on her. He considers his life insurance policy and contemplates suicide. *Rab \\"Second Prize\\" McLaughlin - a reformed alcoholic, the fifth of the gang robbed by Renton at the end of Trainspotting (though not in the film). Has turned to religion in an attempt to curb his alcoholism and distance himself from his former friends. *Francis \\"Franco\\" Begbie ‚Äìa violent psychopath who seeks his former friends after being recently released from prison. He ends up murdering the sex offender Chizzie, effectively destroying the plans of all the characters, though he sees his own actions as heroic. Major themes Welsh picks up upon ways in which Edinburgh has changed. Film adaptation Danny Boyle stated his wish to make a sequel to Trainspotting based on Porno which takes place nine years later. He was reportedly waiting until the original actors themselves age visibly enough to portray the same characters, ravaged by time; Boyle joked that the natural vanity of actors would make it a long wait. On 10 September 2009, Robert Carlyle revealed that Boyle was \\"edging closer\\" to making Porno. Carlyle, who played Begbie in the film, said he would \\"jump through hoops of fire backwards\\" for the filmmaker and would \\"do Porno tomorrow for nothing.\\" Ewan McGregor, who played anti-hero Renton, expressed his reluctance to do a sequel saying it would be a \\"terrible shame\\". Boyle and McGregor had not worked together since 1997's A Life Less Ordinary, when McGregor was passed over in favour of Leonardo DiCaprio for the lead role in Boyle's big screen adaptation of Alex Garland's novel, The Beach. In 2013, McGregor noted that he was \\"ready to work\\" on the film with Boyle after reconciling. In 2013 Boyle said that any sequel to Trainspotting would be loosely based on Porno. On 6 May 2014, Welsh confirmed that he had spent a week with Boyle, Andrew Macdonald and the creative team behind Trainspotting to discuss the sequel. Welsh stated that the meeting was in order to \\"explore the story and script ideas. We're not interested in doing something that will trash the legacy of Trainspotting... we want to do something that's very fresh and contemporary.\\" On 17 November 2014, Welsh revealed that McGregor and Boyle had resolved their differences and had held meetings about the film, saying \\"I know Danny and Ewan are back in touch with each other again. There are others in the cast who‚Äôve had a rocky road, but now also reconciled. With the Trainspotting sequel the attention is going to be even more intense this time round because the first was such a great movie - and Danny‚Äôs such a colossus now. We‚Äôre all protective of the Trainspotting legacy and we want to make a film that adds to that legacy and doesn‚Äôt take away from it.\\" Filming on a sequel to Trainspotting began in May 2016, with all the major cast members reprising their roles and Danny Boyle directing. It was released on 27 January 2017. Release details *2002, UK. Jonathan Cape. Hardback. First edition. *2003, UK. Vintage Press. Paperback *2002, USA. W. W. Norton. Hardback. *2002, USA. W. W.

Encyclop√¶dia Britannica or c.1280‚Äì1360), better known by his courtesy name Guanzhong (Mandarin pronunciation: ), was a Chinese writer who lived during the Ming Dynasty. He was also known by his pseudonym Huhai Sanren (). Luo was attributed with writing Romance of the Three Kingdoms and editing Water Margin, the first two of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. Identity Luo Guanzhong Memorial, in Dongping County, ShandongThe location and date of Luo's birth are controversial. One possibility was that he was from Taiyuan, and lived in the late Yuan Dynasty and early Ming Dynasty by the record of his contemporary, the playwright Jia Zhongming (Ë≥à‰ª≤Êòé), who said that he had met him in 1364. Another possibility was that he was born in Dongyuan, the province of Shandong, in about 1280 ‚Äì 1360. Literary historians suggest other possibilities for his home, also including Hangzhou and Jiangnan. According to Meng Fanren (Â≠üÁπÅ‰ªÅ), Luo can be identified in the pedigree of the Luo family, and Taiyuan is most likely his hometown. But, his name is not in this pedigree, and some people believe that pedigree of the Luo Family can't prove that Luo is the author of Three Kingdoms. Some people doubt that If Luo came from Taiyuan, why he had intimate knowledge of people life in Shandong, and he had taken all his time and energy to write them not those people in Taiyuan, Shanxi. Some people believe that the source of Taiyuan statement, which was written by Jia Zhongming (Ë≥à‰ª≤Êòé), is most likely wrong in handwritten copy. According to the recent research, there were two Luo Guanzhong (ÈôàËæΩÔºåChen Liao), one is Drama artist who came from Taiyuan, another is author of Three Kingdoms who came from Dongping. Recent research has suggested that his date of birth was between 1315‚Äì1318.Ouyang Jian, referenced in Roberts 1991, pg. 938 But other sources state it was nearer to 1330. Works The stories forming the bulk of Romance of the Three Kingdoms and Water Margin are thought to have been developed by many independent storytellers. Shi Nai'an is thought to be the first to assemble Water Margin into a unified work, and Luo subsequently brought it to the current form of 100 chapters. Luo is usually considered the author of Romance of the Three Kingdoms. The Three Sui Quash the Demons' Revolt (Âπ≥Â¶ñÂÇ≥) is a shenmo fantasy story attributed to Luo with 20 chapters, developed from the original pieces of storytelling based on a rebellion at the end of the Northern Song Dynasty, and later expanded by Feng Menglong (È¶ÆÂ§¢Èæç) into 40 chapters.

He is sometimes known as \\"the man in the white suit\\". Background Bell is the son of author-farmer Adrian Bell, compiler of the first ever Times crossword. He is the brother of literary translator Anthea Bell (who died in 2018)The Guardian, obituary, 18 October, 2018 and the uncle of Oliver Kamm, now a Times leader writer who served as his political adviser during his term as a Member of Parliament (MP). He was educated at The Leys School in Cambridge and King's College, Cambridge, where he achieved a first-class honours degree in English. He served on the committee of Cambridge University Liberal Club, including a term as Publicity Officer. He failed to obtain a commission during his two- year national service and served out his time as an acting corporal in the Suffolk Regiment, serving in Cyprus during the emergency. BBC correspondent Martin Bell joined the BBC as a reporter in Norwich in 1962, aged 24, following his graduation. He moved to London three years later, beginning a distinguished career as a foreign affairs correspondent with his first assignment in Ghana. Over the next thirty years, he covered eleven conflicts and reported from eighty countries, making his name with reports from wars and conflicts in Vietnam, the Middle East, Nigeria, Angola, and in Northern Ireland (during the \\"Troubles\\"). His roles at the BBC included diplomatic correspondent (1977‚Äì78), chief Washington correspondent (1978‚Äì89), and Berlin correspondent (1989‚Äì94). He won the Royal Television Society's Reporter of the Year award in 1977 and 1993, and was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1992. That same year, while covering the war in Bosnia, Bell was seriously wounded by shrapnel while recording a report in Sarajevo. He remained an official BBC correspondent, although from the mid-1990s he filed relatively few reports, and became disillusioned with the corporation. He was unimpressed by the BBC's introduction of a 24-hour news channel (BBC News 24) and what he described as the increasing \\"Murdochisation\\" of BBC News. Independent politician In 1997, twenty-four days before that year's British general election, Martin Bell announced that he was leaving the BBC to stand as an independent candidate in the Tatton constituency in Cheshire. Tatton was one of the safest Conservative seats in the country, where the sitting Conservative Member of Parliament, Neil Hamilton, was embroiled in \\"sleaze\\" allegations. The Labour and Liberal Democrat parties withdrew their candidates in Bell's favour in a plan masterminded by Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair's press secretary.Campbell, Alastair, The Blair Years, Random House, London, 2007 Hamilton was trounced, and Bell was elected an MP with a majority of 11,077 votes ‚Äì overturning a Conservative majority of over 22,000 ‚Äì and thus became the first successful independent parliamentary candidate since 1951. He did not often speak in the House of Commons, and when he did it was mostly on matters of British policy in the former Yugoslavia and the Third World. Although Bell voted with the Labour government of Tony Blair on many issues, he voted with the Conservatives in opposing the repeal of Section 28 in 2000 and he also voted against the banning of fox hunting. In November 1997 Bell was cheered from the Conservative benches when he asked Blair about the Bernie Ecclestone affair, \\"Does the Prime Minister agree that the perception of wrongdoing can be as damaging to public confidence as the wrongdoing itself? Have we slain one dragon only to have another take its place, with a red rose in its mouth?\\" As part of his election platform Bell had stated that he would only serve for one term, his specific purpose being to oppose Neil Hamilton. Bell said that the only thing which could make him change his mind would be Hamilton being re- selected by the Tatton Conservative Party as a candidate for the next general election. However, George Osborne (a future Chancellor of the Exchequer) was selected in March 1999 as Conservative Party candidate for Tatton. Hamilton lost his libel case against Mohamed Al-Fayed in December 1999, ending any prospect of him making an immediate political comeback. Though he regretted making the pledge of saying he would only serve for one term, Bell stuck to his promise. In 2001, Bell stood as an independent candidate against another Conservative MP Eric Pickles in the \\"safe\\" Essex constituency of Brentwood and Ongar, where there were accusations that the local Conservative Association had been infiltrated by a Pentecostal church. In this election, Labour and the Liberal Democrats did not stand aside for him. Bell came second and reduced the Conservative majority from 9,690 to 2,821. Having garnered nearly 32% of the votes and second place, Bell announced his retirement from politics, saying that \\"winning one and losing one is not a bad record for an amateur\\". The Channel 4 drama Mr White Goes to Westminster was loosely based on Bell's political career. Post-political life Bell addresses a Frontline Club forum in 2007. Bell was appointed UNICEF UK Ambassador for Humanitarian Emergencies in 2001, to work to improve the plight of children affected by conflict and natural disaster. He made a brief return to television news in 2003 when he provided analysis of the Iraq invasion for ITN's Channel Five News. He compiled films from the daily video footage and drew on his experience to comment upon this material. Bell reversed his previous decision and stood for the European Parliament in the June 2004 elections, but was ultimately unsuccessful as an independent candidate in the East of England region, winning only 6.2% of the vote. Before the 2005 general election he became affiliated with the Independent Network to help promote independent candidates (its most prominent candidate being Reg Keys who fought against prime minister Tony Blair in the Sedgefield constituency). In April 2006, Scottish National Party MP Angus MacNeil asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate whether any law had been broken in the Cash for Peerages scandal. Bell wrote jointly with MacNeil to Prime Minister Tony Blair calling for all appointments to the House of Lords to be suspended. In May 2009, he came out in support of the Green Party in the weeks before the 2009 European Parliament election, supporting the Green Party's 'Clean Campaigning' pledge in the wake of the scandal over MPs' expenses. On 21 May 2009, he appeared on the special live edition of BBC's Question Time which was held in Salisbury in the midst of the political scandal surrounding MPs' expenses. He announced that he was considering standing against a third Conservative MP, Sir Nicholas Winterton, the MP for Macclesfield, at the 2010 general election, but following Winterton's announcement that he was not going to seek re-election, did not do so. He indicated that he might stand against Hazel Blears in Salford (the first sitting MP of a party other than the Conservative Party against whom he expressed an interest in standing) although in the end he did not stand in any constituency. In November 2018, Bell fell at Gatwick Airport and required major maxillo-facial surgery at St George's Hospital to rebuild his face. He praised surgeon Helen Witherow, saying \\"this lady is an absolutely brilliant surgeon, and I think sometimes the NHS can use a bit of good publicity\\".

This machine revolutionized the art of printing.  Life and career  Mergenthaler was born into a German family Hachtel, Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. He was the third son of a school teacher, Johann Georg Mergenthaler, from Hohenacker near the city of Waiblingen.. He was apprenticed to a watchmaker in Bietigheim before emigrating to the United States in 1872 to work with his cousin August Hahl in Washington, D.C. Mergenthaler eventually moved with Hahl's shop to Baltimore, Maryland. In 1878, Mergenthaler became a naturalized citizen of the United States. In 1881, Mergenthaler became Hahl's business partner.Tsaniou, Styliani. \\"Ottmar Mergenthaler.\\" In Immigrant Entrepreneurship: German-American Business Biographies, 1720 to the Present, vol. 3, edited by Giles R. Hoyt. German Historical Institute. Last modified 26 July 2013. = Invention of the Linotype = In 1876, Mergenthaler was approached by James O. Clephane and his associate Charles T. Moore, who sought a quicker way of publishing legal briefs. By 1884 he conceived the idea of assembling metallic letter molds, called matrices, and casting molten metal into them, all within a single machine.The World Book Encyclopedia, 1972 edition. His first attempt proved the idea feasible, and a new company was formed. Always improving his invention, Mergenthaler further developed his idea of an independent matrix machine. In July 1886, the first commercially used Linotype was installed in the printing office of the New York Tribune. Here it was immediately used on the daily paper and a large book. The book, the first ever composed with the new Linotype method, was titled, The Tribune Book of Open-Air Sports. Produced by his Mergenthaler Linotype Company, the machine remained a mainstay of the publishing industry until the 1980s. = Death = Mergenthaler died of tuberculosis in Baltimore in 1899.  Legacy  An operational Linotype machine is on display at the Baltimore Museum of Industry, in the museum's print shop. Baltimore's vocational high school, Mergenthaler Vocational Technical Senior High School, which opened in 1953, is named after him, although it is commonly referred to simply as \\"MERVO\\". Mergenthaler Hall on the Homewood Campus of the Johns Hopkins University was constructed in 1940‚Äì41 with donations by Eugene and Mrs. Ottmar Mergenthaler, son and widow of Ottmar Mergenthaler.

Designer Danielle Bunten Berry (credited as Dan Bunten) took advantage of the four joystick ports of the Atari 400 and 800 to allow four-player simultaneous play. M.U.L.E. was one of the first five games published in 1983 by new company Electronic Arts, alongside Pinball Construction Set, Archon: The Light and the Dark, Worms?, and Hard Hat Mack. Primarily a turn-based strategy game, it incorporates real- time elements where players complete directly as well as aspects that simulate economics. The game was ported to the Commodore 64, Nintendo Entertainment System, and IBM PC (as a self-booting disk). Japanese versions also exist for the PC-8801, Sharp X1, and MSX 2 computers. Like the subsequent models of the Atari 8-bit family, none of these systems allow four players with separate joysticks. The Commodore 64 version lets four players share joysticks, with two players using the keyboard during action portions.  Gameplay  A Multiple Use Labor Element, the eponymous M.U.L.E. Set on the fictional planet Irata (Atari backwards), the game is an exercise in supply and demand economics involving competition among four players, with computer opponents automatically filling in for any missing players. Players choose the race of their colonist, which has advantages and disadvantages that can be paired to their respective strategies. To win, players not only compete against each other to amass the largest amount of wealth, but must also cooperate for the survival of the colony. Central to the game is the acquisition and use of Multiple Use Labor Elements, or M.U.L.E.s, to develop and harvest resources from the player's real estate. Depending on how it is outfitted, a M.U.L.E. can be configured to harvest Energy, Food, Smithore (from which M.U.L.E.s are constructed), and Crystite (a valuable mineral available only at the \\"Tournament\\" level). Players must balance supply and demand of these elements, buying what they need and selling what they don't. Players may exploit or create shortages by refusing to sell to other players or to the \\"store,\\" which raises the price of the resource on the following turns. Scheming between players is encouraged by allowing collusion, which initiates a mode allowing a private transaction. Crystite is the one commodity that is not influenced by supply and demand considerations, being deemed to be sold off-world, so the strategy with this resource is somewhat different; a player may attempt to maximize production without fear of having too much supply for the demand. Each resource is required to do certain things on each turn. For instance, if a player is short on Food, there is less time to take one's turn. If a player is short on Energy, some land plots won't produce any output, while a shortage of Smithore raises the price of M.U.L.E.s and prevents the store from manufacturing new M.U.L.E.s. Players must deal with periodic random events such as runaway M.U.L.E.s, sunspot activity, theft by space pirates, and meteorites, with potentially destructive and beneficial effects. Favorable random events never happen to the player currently in first place, while unfavorable events never happen to the player in last place. Similarly, when two players want to buy a resource at the same price, the player in the losing position automatically wins. Players also can hunt the mountain wampus for a cash reward.  Development  According to Jim Rushing (one of the four original partners in Ozark Softscape), M.U.L.E. was initially called Planet Pioneers during development. It was intended to be similar to Cartels & Cutthroats, with more graphics, better playability, and a focus on multiplayer. The real-time auction element came largely from lead designer Danielle Bunten's Wheeler Dealers. The board game Monopoly was used as a model for the game because of its encouragement of social interaction and for several of the game's elements: the acquisition and development of land as a primary task, a production advantage for grouped plots, different species (√† la the different player tokens), and random events similar to \\"Chance\\" cards. Additional game features such as claim jumping, loans, and crystite depletion were discarded for adding complexity without enhancing gameplay. The setting was inspired by Robert A. Heinlein's Time Enough for Love, wherein galactic colonization is in the style of the American Old West: A few pioneers with drive and primitive tools. The M.U.L.E. itself is based on the idea of the genetically modified animal in Heinlein's novel and given the appearance of a Star Wars Imperial Walker. Another Heinlein novel, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, provided the decision to not have any government or external authority. In the game's original designs, land was sold by auction, but this caused a feedback loop in which the wealthiest player had the most land and thus made the most money; thus, the developers created the \\"land authority\\" that gives each player a free plot of land each turn. Ozark Softscape developed the game for the Atari 8-bit family first because of its policy of developing for the most advanced computers then porting them to other platforms, removing or altering features such as sprites as necessary. Bunten stated that Ozark did not port the game to the Apple II because \\"M.U.L.E. can't be done for an Apple\\". The IBM PC port of M.U.L.E was developed by K-Byte Software, an affiliate of Electronic Arts, and published by IBM as part of their venture into the home market with the IBM PCjr, but it sold poorly due to being released in 1985 after the latter had been discontinued (although the game did not have any actual PCjr support).  Reception  M.U.L.E. only sold 30,000 copies but was lauded by reviewers. Computer Gaming World described it as a \\"fascinating and very enjoyable game which comes to its very best point with four human players\\". Minor criticisms included too-weak computer opponents and the lack of a save feature. Softline called M.U.L.E. \\"what computer games should be like. It's a game, and it's a learning experience. It's also stimulating, fun, frustrating, thought provoking, fun, addictive, and fun\\". The magazine praised it as offering \\"valuable lessons\\" on economic topics, noting that \\"Most of them are learned the hard way\\", and concluded that \\"The game feels good\\" and \\"virtually flawless\\" because of the human-computer and human-human competition. Allen Doum reviewed the game for Computer Gaming World, and stated that \\"A great deal of thought was obviously put into the \\"human engineering\\". The auctions, in particular, give a player the choice to buy or sell, to set the price of an item and even collude with other players entirely by using the joystick, while the on-screen display clearly shows the effects of these decisions. All in all, a superior game.\\" John J. Anderson wrote in Creative Computing, \\"I should also mention that there is no shooting to be found anywhere in the game. How positively refreshing ... Mule belongs on every Atari software shelf in the world: in every home and every school, near every Atari.\\" Scott Mace of InfoWorld called M.U.L.E. unusual in the ease with which it allows multiplayer interaction through a single game computer console. He wrote that it would have \\"incredible lasting power, just like the best of the board games\\" and stated \\"I learned more about the economics of the marketplace from M.U.L.E. than I ever did in college\\". Leo Laporte of Hi-Res also said that he learned more economics from the game than during college. He predicted that M.U.L.E. \\"may revitalize the [video game] industry. It ought to make them rich anyway\\", praised its theme as \\"most captivating musical come-on I've ever heard\\", and concluded \\"If you ask me, M.U.L.E. is the perfect game.\\" Reporting in BYTE that his children loved it, Jerry Pournelle described M.U.L.E. as \\"a cross between Hammurabi, Diplomacy, and an arcade game, with lots of strategic decisions‚Äîprovided that you're skillful enough with a joystick to implement what you've decided to do\\". Another reviewer wrote in the magazine that \\"it is impossible to adequately describe all the interaction and economically realistic subtleties of M.U.L.E.\\", concluding that it was \\"an intriguing way to illustrate some of the triumphs and perils of free enterprise\\". Orson Scott Card in Compute! in 1983 gave M.U.L.E. and two other EA games, Archon: The Light and the Dark and Worms?, complimentary reviews, writing that \\"they are original; they do what they set out to do very, very well; they allow the player to take part in the creativity; they do things that only computers can do\\". The magazine listed the game in May 1988 as one of \\"Our Favorite Games\\", stating that it \\"requires a sense of strategy as well as proficiency at joystick maneuvers\\". Steven A. List reviewed M.U.L.E. in Space Gamer No. 70. He commented that \\"M.U.L.E. is simply a great game, a tour de force in programming and design, good family entertainment, educational and exciting. If you don't have a computer and disk drive, it may be worth the investment just to be able to play this.\\" The Addison-Wesley Book of Atari Software 1984 gave the game an overall A rating, stating that it \\"combines some of the best features of Monopoly with economic simulation games like [Hammurabi]\\" while teaching \\"valuable lessons in economies in a fun way\\". The book noted that \\"when several people play, the game becomes involved and interactive\\". Two of Zzap!64s reviewers stated in 1985 that M.U.L.E. was \\"an excellent trading game\\" and \\"recommended for both novice and skilled\\", while the third complained that he \\"found little [excitement] ... nothing to keep me interested\\". In 1984 M.U.L.E. was awarded \\"1984 Best Multi-Player Video Game/Computer Game\\" at the 5th annual Arkie Awards where judges described it as \\"a unique blend of boardgame strategy and computer-game pacing\\" and noted that \\"since its release, 'M.U.L.E.' has gained an intense cult following\\". Softline readers named the game the third most-popular Atari program of 1983. With a score of 7.44 out of 10, in 1988 M.U.L.E. was among the first members of the Computer Gaming World Hall of Fame, honoring those games rated highly over time by readers. In 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games the magazine gave the title five of five stars, calling it \\"An all-time computer classic, this was one of the only games ever devised that was playable and entertaining for four humans. Economics made fun! ... it still holds up well over all these years and, by itself, provides justification for holding onto the 8-bit Atari\\". In 1996, the magazine named M.U.L.E. as #3 on its Best Games of All Time list. It was named #5 of the \\"Ten Greatest PC Games Ever\\" by PC World in 2009. M.U.L.E. was listed as the 19th most important video game of all time by 1UP.com. Chris Crawford said of the game that considering the platform the team had to deal with, M.U.L.E. was \\"the greatest game design ever done.\\"  Legacy  =Influence= Shigeru Miyamoto cited M.U.L.E. as an influence on the Pikmin series.http://www.4gamer.net/games/168/G016837/20130712087/index_2.html Will Wright dedicated his game The Sims to the memory of Bunten. The M.U.L.E. theme song was included in Wright's later game, Spore, as an Easter egg in the space level. An ability in Starcraft II allows Terran players to \\"call down\\" multiple robotic workers called M.U.L.E.s. A board game adaptation, M.U.L.E. The Board Game, was released in 2015.https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/182619/mule-board-game Unofficial clones are Subtrade, Traders, and Space HoRSE. =Enhanced versions= In 2005, a netplay component was integrated into the Atari800WinPlus emulator enabling the original game to be played over the Internet. Computer Gaming World printed in April 1994 that EA \\"was working on a videogame version of the game, but the design was terminated because of creative differences between the publisher and the designer\\". The magazine reported a rumor in May 1994 that a \\"Genesis version has been completed, but EA is debating over its release\\", and then in August 1994 that Bunten had decided against remaking the game because EA \\"wanted me to put in guns and bombs\\". An editorial asked the company to \\"give us M.U.L.E. with Smithore and Crystite as its creator intended\\". Bunten was working on an Internet version of M.U.L.E. until her death in 1998. An online, licensed remake called Planet M.U.L.E. was released in 2009. The game is free for download for major platforms. Comma 8 Studios later acquired the mobile M.U.L.E. license and released M.U.L.E. Returns for iOS in November 2013. The source code to M.U.L.E., believed lost, was found in 2020 in the possession of Julian Eggebrecht. He had pitched an enhanced 16-bit version of the game.

When renal blood flow is reduced, juxtaglomerular cells in the kidneys convert the precursor prorenin (already present in the blood) into renin and secrete it directly into circulation. Plasma renin then carries out the conversion of angiotensinogen, released by the liver, to angiotensin I. Angiotensin I is subsequently converted to angiotensin II by the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) found on the surface of vascular endothelial cells, predominantly those of the lungs. Angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictive peptide that causes blood vessels to narrow, resulting in increased blood pressure. Angiotensin II also stimulates the secretion of the hormone aldosterone from the adrenal cortex. Aldosterone causes the renal tubules to increase the reabsorption of sodium which in consequence causes the reabsorption of water into the blood, while at the same time causing the excretion of potassium (to maintain electrolyte balance). This increases the volume of extracellular fluid in the body, which also increases blood pressure. If the RAS is abnormally active, blood pressure will be too high. There are several types of drugs which includes ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and renin inhibitors that interrupt different steps in this system to improve blood pressure. These drugs are one of the primary ways to control high blood pressure, heart failure, kidney failure, and harmful effects of diabetes. Renin activates the renin‚Äìangiotensin system by cleaving angiotensinogen, produced by the liver, to yield angiotensin I, which is further converted into angiotensin II by ACE, the angiotensin‚Äìconverting enzyme primarily within the capillaries of the lungs. Activation Further information: Autoregulation RAAS schematic The system can be activated when there is a loss of blood volume or a drop in blood pressure (such as in hemorrhage or dehydration). This loss of pressure is interpreted by baroreceptors in the carotid sinus. It can also be activated by a decrease in the filtrate sodium chloride (NaCl) concentration or a decreased filtrate flow rate that will stimulate the macula densa to signal the juxtaglomerular cells to release renin. # If the perfusion of the juxtaglomerular apparatus in the kidney's macula densa decreases, then the juxtaglomerular cells (granular cells, modified pericytes in the glomerular capillary) release the enzyme renin. # Renin cleaves a decapeptide from angiotensinogen, a globular protein. The decapeptide is known as angiotensin I. # Angiotensin I is then converted to an octapeptide, angiotensin II by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which is thought to be found mainly in endothelial cells of the capillaries throughout the body, within the lungs and the epithelial cells of the kidneys. One study in 1992 found ACE in all blood vessel endothelial cells. # Angiotensin II is the major bioactive product of the renin‚Äìangiotensin system, binding to receptors on intraglomerular mesangial cells, causing these cells to contract along with the blood vessels surrounding them and causing the release of aldosterone from the zona glomerulosa in the adrenal cortex. Angiotensin II acts as an endocrine, autocrine/paracrine, and intracrine hormone. Cardiovascular effects Further reading: Angiotensin effects and Aldosterone function Renal hormone regulation schematic Angiotensin I may have some minor activity, but angiotensin II is the major bio-active product. Angiotensin II has a variety of effects on the body: *Throughout the body, angiotensin II is a potent vasoconstrictor of arterioles. *In the kidneys, angiotensin II constricts glomerular arterioles, having a greater effect on efferent arterioles than afferent. As with most other capillary beds in the body, the constriction of afferent arterioles increases the arteriolar resistance, raising systemic arterial blood pressure and decreasing the blood flow. However, the kidneys must continue to filter enough blood despite this drop in blood flow, necessitating mechanisms to keep glomerular blood pressure up. To do this, angiotensin II constricts efferent arterioles, which forces blood to build up in the glomerulus, increasing glomerular pressure. The glomerular filtration rate (GFR) is thus maintained, and blood filtration can continue despite lowered overall kidney blood flow. Because the filtration fraction, which is the ratio of the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) to the renal plasma flow (RPF), has increased, there is less plasma fluid in the downstream peritubular capillaries. This in turn leads to a decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure (due to unfiltered plasma proteins) in the peritubular capillaries. The effect of decreased hydrostatic pressure and increased oncotic pressure in the peritubular capillaries will facilitate increased reabsorption of tubular fluid. *Angiotensin II decreases medullary blood flow through the vasa recta. This decreases the washout of NaCl and urea in the kidney medullary space. Thus, higher concentrations of NaCl and urea in the medulla facilitate increased absorption of tubular fluid. Furthermore, increased reabsorption of fluid into the medulla will increase passive reabsorption of sodium along the thick ascending limb of the Loop of Henle. * Angiotensin II stimulates / exchangers located on the apical membranes (faces the tubular lumen) of cells in the proximal tubule and thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle in addition to channels in the collecting ducts. This will ultimately lead to increased sodium reabsorption. * Angiotensin II stimulates the hypertrophy of renal tubule cells, leading to further sodium reabsorption. *In the adrenal cortex, angiotensin II acts to cause the release of aldosterone. Aldosterone acts on the tubules (e.g., the distal convoluted tubules and the cortical collecting ducts) in the kidneys, causing them to reabsorb more sodium and water from the urine. This increases blood volume and, therefore, increases blood pressure. In exchange for the reabsorbing of sodium to blood, potassium is secreted into the tubules, becomes part of urine and is excreted. *Angiotensin II causes the release of anti-diuretic hormone (ADH), also called vasopressin ‚Äì ADH is made in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary gland. As its name suggests, it also exhibits vaso-constrictive properties, but its main course of action is to stimulate reabsorption of water in the kidneys. ADH also acts on the central nervous system to increase an individual's appetite for salt, and to stimulate the sensation of thirst. These effects directly act together to increase blood pressure and are opposed by atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP). Local renin‚Äìangiotensin systems Locally expressed renin‚Äìangiotensin systems have been found in a number of tissues, including the kidneys, adrenal glands, the heart, vasculature and nervous system, and have a variety of functions, including local cardiovascular regulation, in association or independently of the systemic renin‚Äìangiotensin system, as well as non- cardiovascular functions. Outside the kidneys, renin is predominantly picked up from the circulation but may be secreted locally in some tissues; its precursor prorenin is highly expressed in tissues and more than half of circulating prorenin is of extrarenal origin, but its physiological role besides serving as precursor to renin is still unclear. Outside the liver, angiotensinogen is picked up from the circulation or expressed locally in some tissues; with renin they form angiotensin I, and locally expressed angiotensin-converting enzyme, chymase or other enzymes can transform it into angiotensin II. This process can be intracellular or interstitial. In the adrenal glands, it is likely involved in the paracrine regulation of aldosterone secretion; in the heart and vasculature, it may be involved in remodeling or vascular tone; and in the brain, where it is largely independent of the circulatory RAS, it may be involved in local blood pressure regulation. In addition, both the central and peripheral nervous systems can use angiotensin for sympathetic neurotransmission. Other places of expression include the reproductive system, the skin and digestive organs. Medications aimed at the systemic system may affect the expression of those local systems, beneficially or adversely. Fetal renin‚Äìangiotensin system In the fetus, the renin‚Äìangiotensin system is predominantly a sodium-losing system, as angiotensin II has little or no effect on aldosterone levels. Renin levels are high in the fetus, while angiotensin II levels are significantly lower; this is due to the limited pulmonary blood flow, preventing ACE (found predominantly in the pulmonary circulation) from having its maximum effect. Clinical significance Flowchart showing the clinical effects of RAAS activity and the sites of action of ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers. * ACE inhibitors of angiotensin-converting enzyme are often used to reduce the formation of the more potent angiotensin II. Captopril is an example of an ACE inhibitor. ACE cleaves a number of other peptides, and in this capacity is an important regulator of the kinin‚Äìkallikrein system, as such blocking ACE can lead to side effects. * Angiotensin II receptor antagonists, also known as angiotensin receptor blockers, can be used to prevent angiotensin II from acting on its receptors. * Direct renin inhibitors can also be used for hypertension.Presentation on Direct Renin Inhibitors as Antihypertensive Drugs The drugs that inhibit renin are aliskiren and the investigational remikiren. * Vaccines against angiotensin II, for example CYT006-AngQb, have been investigated.

The American paddlefish is often referred to as a primitive fish or a relict species because it retains some morphological characteristics of its early ancestors, including a skeleton that is almost entirely cartilaginous and a paddle-shaped rostrum (snout) that extends nearly one-third their body length. It has been referred to as a freshwater shark because of its heterocercal tail or caudal fin resembling that of sharks. The American paddlefish is a highly derived fish because it has evolved with adaptations such as filter feeding. Its rostrum and cranium are covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors for locating swarms of zooplankton, which is their primary food source. American paddlefish are native to the Mississippi River basin and once moved freely under the relatively natural, unaltered conditions that existed prior to the early 1900s. Paddlefish commonly inhabited large, free-flowing rivers, braided channels, backwaters, and oxbow lakes throughout the Mississippi River drainage basin, and adjacent Gulf drainages. Their peripheral range extended into the Great Lakes, with occurrences in Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada until about 90 years ago. American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically primarily because of overfishing, habitat destruction, and pollution. Poaching has also been a contributing factor to their decline and will continue to be as long as the demand for caviar remains strong. Naturally occurring American paddlefish populations have been extirpated from most of their peripheral range, as well as from New York, Maryland, Virginia, and Pennsylvania. The current range of American paddlefish has been reduced to the Mississippi and Missouri River tributaries and Mobile Bay drainage basin. They are currently found in twenty-two states in the U.S., and those populations are protected under state, federal and international laws. Taxonomy, etymology and evolution An American paddlefish in a large aquarium tank American paddlefish are closely related to sturgeons in the order Acipenseriformes, an order of basal ray-finned fishes that includes sturgeon and paddlefish, several species of which are now extinct. Paddlefish have a long fossil record which dates their first appearance approximately 125 million years ago. Fossils of a second extinct species, P. tuberculata, which dates back approximately 60million years ago, were found in the Lower Paleocene Tullock Formation in Montana. In 1797, French naturalist Bernard Germain de Lac√©p√®de established the genus Polyodon for paddlefish, which today includes a single extant species, Polyodon spathula. Lac√©p√®de disagreed with Pierre Joseph Bonnaterre's description in Tableau encyclop√©dique et m√©thodique (1788), which suggested paddlefish were a species of shark. Lac√©p√®de noted, \\"The country and habits of this fish are still unknown.\\" When Lac√©p√®de established the binomial, Polydon feuille, he was unaware the species had already been named in 1772 by taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum who described paddlefish as Squalus spathula. As a result of Lac√©p√®de's inadvertent double naming, Polyodon spathula became the preferred scientific name of American paddlefish, and Squalus spathula became the synonym as one of two names applied to the group. Walbaum, 1792, is recognized and cited as the authority. The family Polyodontidae comprises five described species: three extinct species from western North America, one recently extinct species from China (the Chinese paddlefish, Psephurus gladius), and one extant species, the American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula), native to the Mississippi River Basin in the United States, American paddlefish are the only living species in the genus Polyodon. They are often referred to as primitive fish, or relict species, because of morphological characteristics they retain from some of their early ancestors as evidenced in the fossil record which dates them back to the Late Cretaceous, 70 to 75million years ago. Some of their primitive characteristics include a skeleton composed primarily of cartilage, and a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, although they are not closely related. Fossil paddlefishes with recognizable rostrums date from the Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene periods 65million years ago. An elongated rostrum is a morphological characteristic of Polyodontidae, but only the genus Polyodon (P. spathula and the extinct P. tuberculata) have characteristics adapted specifically for filter feeding, including the jaw, gill arches, and cranium. The gill rakers of American paddlefish are composed of extensive comb-like filaments believed to have inspired the etymology of the genus name, Polyodon, a Greek compound word meaning \\"many toothed\\". Adult American paddlefish are actually toothless, although numerous small teeth less than were found in a juvenile paddlefish measuring . Spathula references the elongated, paddle-shaped snout or rostrum. Compared to Chinese paddlefish and fossil genera, American paddlefish (and by extension, a fossil relative, P. tuberculata) are considered to be a highly derived species because of their novel adaptations. The Chinese paddlefish was recently declared extinct. The primary reasons for their decline are similar to those of American paddlefish and include overfishing, the construction of dams, and destruction of habitat. Unlike the planktivorous American paddlefish, Chinese paddlefish were strong swimmers, grew larger, and are opportunistic piscivores that feed on small fishes and crustaceans. Some distinct morphological differences of Chinese paddlefish include a narrower, sword-like rostrum, and a protrusible mouth. They also have fewer, thicker gill rakers than American paddlefish. The last confirmed sighting of a live Chinese paddlefish was made on the Yangtzee River on January 24, 2003. From 2006 to 2008, scientists conducted surveys in an effort to locate the fish. They used several boats, deployed 4762 setlines, 111 anchored setlines and 950 drift nets covering on the upper Yangtze River, most of which lies within the protected area of the Upper Yangtze National Nature Reserve. They did not catch a single fish. They also used hydroacoustic equipment to monitor active sound in water (sonar), but were unable to confirm the presence of paddlefish. Description General morphology of the American paddlefish Paddlefish ram suspension-feeding zooplankton in aquarium American paddlefish are among the largest and longest-lived freshwater fishes in North America. They have a shark-like body, average in length, weigh , and can live in excess of thirty years. For most populations the median age is five to eight years and the maximum age is fourteen to eighteen years. The age of American paddlefish is best determined by dentary studies, a process which usually occurs on fish harvested during snagging season, a popular sport fishing activity in certain parts of the U.S. The dentary is removed from the lower jawbone, cleaned of any remaining soft tissue, and cross-sectioned to expose the annual rings. The dentary rings are counted in much the same way a tree is aged. Dentary studies suggest that some individuals can live 60 years or longer, and that females typically live longer and grow larger than males. American paddlefish are smooth-skinned and almost entirely cartilaginous. Their eyes are small and directed laterally. They have a large, tapering operculum flap, a large mouth, and a flat, paddle-shaped rostrum that measures approximately one-third of their body length. During the initial stages of development from embryo to hatchling, American paddlefish have no rostrum. It begins to form shortly after hatching. The rostrum is an extension of the cranium, not of the upper and lower jaws or olfactory system as with the long snouts of other fish. Other distinguishing characteristics include a deeply forked heterocercal caudal fin and dull coloration, often with mottling, ranging from bluish gray to black dorsally grading to a whitish underbelly. Feeding ecology and physiology Scientists began to debate the function of the American paddlefish's rostrum when the species was described in the late 1700s. They had once believed it was used to excavate bottom substrate or functioned as a balancing mechanism and navigational aid. However, laboratory experiments in 1993 that utilized advanced technology in the field of electron microscopy have established conclusively that the rostrum of American paddlefish is covered with tens of thousands of sensory receptors. These receptors are morphologically similar to the ampullae of Lorenzini of sharks and rays, and are indeed passive ampullary-type electroreceptors used by American paddlefish to detect plankton. Clusters of electroreceptors also cover the head and operculum flaps. The diet of the American paddlefish consists primarily of zooplankton. Their electroreceptors can detect weak electrical fields that signal not only the presence of zooplankton, but also the individual feeding and swimming movements of zooplankton appendages. When a swarm of zooplankton is detected, the paddlefish swims forward continuously with its mouth wide open, forcing water over the gill rakers to filter out prey. Such feeding behavior is considered ram suspension-feeding. Further research has indicated that the electroreceptor of the paddlefish may serve as a navigational aid for obstacle avoidance. American paddlefish have small undeveloped eyes that are directed laterally. Unlike most fishes, American paddlefish hardly respond to overhead shadows or changes in illumination. Electroreception appears to have largely replaced vision as a primary sensory modality, which indicates a reliance on electroreceptors for detecting prey. However, the rostrum is not their only means of food detection. Some reports suggest a damaged rostrum would render American paddlefish less capable of foraging efficiently to maintain good health, but laboratory experiments and field research indicate otherwise. As well as electroreceptors on the rostrum, American paddlefish have sensory pores covering nearly half of the skin surface extending from the rostrum to the top of the head down to the tips of the operculum flaps. Studies have indicated that American paddlefish with damaged or abbreviated rostrums are still able to forage and maintain good health. Reproduction and life cycle Development of paddlefish from embryo to larval stage right American paddlefish are long-lived, sexually late maturing pelagic fish. Females do not begin spawning until they are seven to ten years old, some as late as sixteen to eighteen years old. Females do not spawn every year, rather they spawn every second or third year. Males spawn more frequently, usually every year or every other year beginning around age seven, some as late as nine or ten years of age. American paddlefish begin their upstream spawning migration sometime during early spring; some begin in late fall. They spawn on silt-free gravel bars that would otherwise be exposed to air or covered by very shallow water were it not for the rises in the river from snow melt and annual spring rains that cause flooding. Although availability of preferred spawning habitat is essential, there are three precise environmental events that must occur before American paddlefish will spawn. The water temperature must be from ; the lengthened photoperiod which occurs in spring triggers biological and behavioral processes that are dependent on increasing day length; and there must be a proper rise and flow in the river before a successful spawn can occur. Historically, American paddlefish did not spawn every year because the precise environmental events occurred just once every 4 or 5 years. American paddlefish are broadcast spawners, also referred to as mass spawners or synchronous spawners. Gravid females release their eggs into the water over bare rocks or gravel at the same time males release their sperm. Fertilization occurs externally. The eggs become sticky after they are released into the water and will attach to the bottom substrate. Incubation varies depending on water temperature, but in water the eggs will hatch into larval fish in about seven days. After hatching, the larval fish drift downstream into areas of low flow velocity where they forage on zooplankton. Young American paddlefish are poor swimmers which makes them susceptible to predation. Therefore, rapid first-year growth is important to their survival. Fry can grow about per week, and by late July the fingerlings are around long. Their rate of growth is variable and highly dependent on food abundance. Higher growth rates occur in areas where food is not limited. The feeding behavior of fingerlings is quite different from that of older juveniles and adults. They capture individual plankton one by one, which requires detection and location of individual Daphnia on approach, followed by an intercept maneuver to capture the selected prey. By late September fingerlings have developed into juveniles, and are around long. After the 1st year their growth rate slows and is highly variable. Studies indicate that by age 5 their growth rate averages around per year depending on the abundance of food and other environmental influences. As revealed in a paper published in July 2020, eggs from three Russian sturgeons were crossbred with American paddlefish using sperm from four male paddlefish, resulting in successful hybrids called sturddlefish, a portmanteau of the two names. The resulting offspring had a survival rate of 62% to 74% and on average reached after a year of growth. This is the first time such fish from different genera and families successfully were crossbred. Habitat and distribution Map of the United States showing distribution of paddlefish American paddlefish are highly mobile and well adapted to living in rivers. They inhabit many types of riverine habitats throughout much of the Mississippi Valley and adjacent Gulf slope drainages. They occur most frequently in deeper, low current areas such as side channels, oxbows, backwater lakes, bayous, and tailwaters below dams. They have been observed to move more than in a river system. American paddlefish are endemic to the Mississippi River Basin, historically occurring from the Missouri and Yellowstone rivers in the northwest to the Ohio and Allegheny rivers of the northeast; the headwaters of the Mississippi River south to its mouth, from the San Jacinto River in the southwest to the Tombigbee and Alabama rivers of the southeast. They were extirpated from New York, Maryland and Pennsylvania, as well as from much of their peripheral range in the Great Lakes region, including Lake Huron and Lake Helen in Canada. In 1991, Pennsylvania implemented a reintroduction program utilizing hatchery-reared American paddlefish in an effort to establish self-sustaining populations in the upper Ohio and lower Allegheny rivers. In 1998, New York initiated a stocking program upstream in the Allegheny Reservoir above Kinzua Dam, and a second stocking in 2006 in Conewango Creek, a relatively unaltered section of their historic range. Reports of free ranging adults captured by gill nets have since been documented in Pennsylvania and New York, but there is no evidence of natural reproduction. They are currently found in 22 states in the US, and are protected under state and federal laws. There are 13 states that allow commercial or sport fishing for American paddlefish. Human interaction =Propagation and culture= Caesarean-section surgery to extract roe, fertilize, and incubate. Blind Pony Hatchery in Missouri, 1995 The artificial propagation of American paddlefish began with the efforts of the Missouri Department of Conservation during the early 1960s, and focused primarily on maintenance of the sport fishery. However, it was the growing importance of American paddlefish for their meat and roe that became the catalyst for further development of culture techniques for aquaculture in the United States. Artificial propagation requires broodstock which, because of the late sexual maturation of American paddlefish, are initially obtained from the wild and brought into a hatchery environment. The fish are injected with LH-RH hormone to stimulate spawning. The number of eggs a female may produce depends on the size of the fish and can range anywhere from 70,000‚Äì300,000 eggs. Unlike most teleosts, the oviduct branches of American paddlefish and sturgeons are not directly attached to the ovaries; rather, they open dorsally into the body cavity. To determine the status of progression toward maturation, ova staging is performed. The process begins with a minor procedure that involves a small abdominal incision from which to extract a few sample oocytes. The oocytes are boiled in water for a few minutes until the yolk is hardened, and then they are cut in half to expose the nucleus. The exposed nucleus is examined under a microscope to determine stage of maturity. Once maturation is confirmed, one of three procedures is used to extract the eggs from a female paddlefish. The three procedures are (1) the traditional hand-stripping method, considered to be time-consuming and laborious; (2) Caesarean section, a relatively quick surgical method of extracting eggs through a abdominal incision; considered faster than hand stripping, suturing can be time-consuming and the incision may result in muscular stress and poor suture retention which lowers survival rate; and (3) MIST, (minimally invasive surgical technique) which is the fastest of the three procedures because it requires less handling of the fish and eliminates the need for suturing. A small internal incision is made in the dorsal area of the oviduct, which allows direct stripping of eggs from the body cavity through the gonopore bypassing the oviductal funnels. A spermiating male indicates successful production of mature spermatozoa which results in the release of large volumes of milt over the course of three to four days. Milt is collected by inserting a short plastic tube with syringe attached into the urogenital opening of the male and applying light suction with the syringe to draw the milt. The collected milt is diluted in water just prior to adding it to the eggs and the combination is gently stirred for about a minute to achieve fertilization. Fertilized eggs are adhesive and demersal, therefore if incubation is to take place in a flow-through hatching jar, the eggs must be treated to prevent clumping. Incubation usually takes anywhere from five to twelve days. =Global commercial market= right Advancements in biotechnology have created a global commercial market for the polyculture of American paddlefish. In 1970, American paddlefish were stocked in several rivers in Europe and Asia. Introduction began when five thousand hatched larvae from Missouri hatcheries in the United States were exported to the former USSR for aquacultural utilization. Reproduction was successful in 1988 and 1989, and resulted in the exportation of juveniles to Romania and Hungary. American paddlefish are now being raised in Ukraine, Germany, Austria, the Czech Republic, and the Plovdiv and Vidin regions in Bulgaria. In May 2006, specimens of different sizes and weights were caught by professional fisherman near Prahovo in the Serbian part of the Danube River. In 1988, fertilized American paddlefish eggs and larvae from Missouri hatcheries were first introduced into China. Since that time, China imports approximately 4.5million fertilized eggs and larvae every year from hatcheries in Russia and the United States. Some American paddlefish are polycultured in carp ponds and sold to restaurants while others are cultured for brood stock and caviar production. China has also exported American paddlefish to Cuba, where they are farmed for caviar production. =Sport fishing= American paddlefish are a popular sport fish where their populations are sufficient to allow such activity. Areas where there are no self-sustaining populations rely on state and federal restocking programs to maintain a viable fishery. A 2009 report includes the following states as allowing American paddlefish sport fishing per their respective state and federal regulations: Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Mississippi, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Dakota and Tennessee. Since American paddlefish are filter- feeders, they will not take bait or lures, and must be caught by snagging. The official state record in Kansas is a American paddlefish snagged in 2004; Montana, a American paddlefish snagged in 1973; and in North Dakota, a American paddlefish snagged in 2010. The largest American paddlefish on record was captured in West Okoboji Lake, Iowa in 1916 by a spear fisherman, and measured long, and weighed an estimated . Population declines Angler landing a large paddlefish =Overfishing and habitat destruction= American paddlefish populations have declined dramatically, primarily as a result of overfishing and habitat destruction. In 2004 they were listed as Vulnerable (VU A3de ver 3.1) on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. They are currently proposed for listing as VU 3de throughout their range as the result of a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service assessment. The assessment concluded that \\"an overall population size reduction of at least 30% may occur within the next 10 years or three generations due to actual or potential levels of exploitation and the effects of introduced taxa, pollutants, competitors or parasites.\\" American paddlefish are filter-feeding pelagic fish that require large, free-flowing rivers with braided channels, backwater areas, oxbow lakes that are rich in zooplankton, and gravel bars for spawning. Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals. Channelization and groynes or wing dykes have caused the narrowing of rivers and altered flow, destroying crucial spawning and nursery habitat. As a result, most impounded populations are not self-sustaining and must be stocked to maintain a viable sport fishery. =Zebra mussels= Zebra mussel infestations in the Mississippi River, Great Lakes and other Midwest rivers are also negatively affecting American paddlefish populations. Zebra mussels are an invasive species well adapted for explosive population growth as a result of high rates of fecundity and recruitment. As filter feeders, zebra mussels rely on plankton and can filter significant amounts of phytoplankton and zooplankton from the water, altering the availability of an important food source for paddlefish and native unionidae. A few days after the fertilization of zebra mussel eggs, a microscopic larva emerges called a veliger. During this initial stage of development, which usually lasts a few weeks, veligers are able to swim freely in the water column with other microscopic animals comprising zooplankton. Veligers are poor swimmers, making them susceptible to predation by any animal that feeds on zooplankton. However, natural predation of zebra mussels at any stage of development has not made a significant contribution to the long-term reduction of zebra mussel populations. =Poaching= Poaching has been a contributing factor to declining populations of American paddlefish in the states where they are commercially exploited, particularly while the demand for caviar remains strong. Since the 1980s, a trade embargo on Iran restricted imports of the highly sought after and most expensive beluga caviar from the Caspian Sea, limiting U.S. sources of caviar. The most sought after caviar is produced by sturgeons in the Northern Caspian Sea, but overfishing and poaching have exhausted the supply. American sturgeon and paddlefish populations were targeted as likely substitutes. The roe of American paddlefish can be processed into caviar similar in taste, color, size and texture to sevruga sturgeon caviar from the Caspian Sea. Several cases of mislabeled American paddlefish roe sold as Caspian Sea caviar have been prosecuted by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS). State and federal regulations restricting the harvest of American paddlefish populations in the wild, and the illegal trafficking of their roe are strictly enforced. Related violations such as the illegal transport of American paddlefish roe have resulted in convictions with substantial fines and prison sentences. Paddlefish are also protected under CITES, (Convention on the International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora).

At maturity, the species measured an average length of , making it one of the largest species of primarily freshwater fishes. It was the only species in the genus Psephurus and one of two living species in the paddlefish family (Polyodontidae), the other being the American paddlefish (Polyodon spathula). It was an anadromous species, meaning that it spent part of its adult life at sea, while migrating upriver to spawn. Unlike its close relative, the Chinese paddlefish was largely piscivorous, and mainly preyed on small to medium-sized fish. Fishing of the Chinese paddlefish goes back centuries, with annual harvest reaching 25 tons by the 1970s. Since the 1990s, the species was officially listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as critically endangered, and has not been seen alive since 2003. A 2019 paper from the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute reported their extinction, suggesting that they had gone extinct sometime between 2005 and 2010, but had been functionally extinct since 1993. It was unanimously agreed to be extinct by the Species Survival Commission Sturgeon Specialist Group of the IUCN on the 15th of September 2019. It was stated that the IUCN Red List status would not be updated until June 2020, but has not been updated as of October 2020. The main cause of decline was the construction of the Gezhouba and Three Gorges dams, causing population fragmentation and blocking the anadromous spawning migration. Overfishing also played a significant role. Description thumb The Chinese paddlefish had a white underbelly, and its back and head were grey, while extremities including the rostrum and the fins were pinkish red in colour. It had a pronounced white ridge along the sides of its body which extended from the middle of the body to the caudal fin. Its dorsal and anal fins were situated considerably far back on the body. The titular paddle was wedge-shaped with a triangular profile and was not flattened, as opposed to the rectangular, flattened profile of the American paddlefish's equivalent. The paddle was narrow and pointed, and could reach one third of total body length. Its eyes are small and round. The teeth were noted to be small, and the jaw to be protrusible, unlike the American paddlefish. The tail fin was heterocercal, with a well developed caudal lobe. Like other members of Acipenseriformes the skeleton was cartilaginous and the body was smooth and largely lacking in scales, except for small scales in the caudal peduncle and caudal fin. They reached sexual maturity at a weight of around , usually by the time they were age seven or eight, with a typical body length of . Anecdotal reports indicate the Chinese paddlefish could reach in length and weigh up to , or even several thousand pounds. Limited research has been conducted on the species maximum size and weight as a result of its endangered status and lack of sightings over the years. A more generally accepted maximum size is in weight and in length. Taxonomy Scientific drawing of Psephurus galdius from 1868 =Taxonomic history= The species was first named as a species of Polyodon by Eduard von Martens in 1862.√úber einen neuen Polyodon aus dem Yantsekiang und √ºber die sogenannten Glaspolypen. Monatsberichte der K√∂niglichen Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften zu Berlin 1861 (pt. 1) (for 2 May 1861): 476-479. It was placed into a separate, monotypic genus by Albert G√ºnther in 1873.G√ºnther, A. 1873: Report on a collection of fishes from China. Annals and Magazine of Natural History (Series 4) 12 (69): 239‚Äì250 The species was also given a different name, Polyodon angustifolium by Johann Jakob Kaup also in 1862,Kaup, J.J. 1862: Eine neue Art von Spatularia. Archiv f√ºr Naturgeschichte 28 (1): 278‚Äì281 but this is considered a junior synonym of P. gladius. =Etymology= In Chinese this paddlefish is also called \\"elephant fish\\" (Ë±°È≠ö; xi√†ngy√∫) because its snout vaguely resembles an elephant trunk. It is recorded sometimes in Classical Chinese as wƒõi-fish (ÈÆ™). More poetically, it is sometimes referred to as the \\"Giant Panda of the Rivers\\", not because of any physical resemblance to a giant panda, but because of its rarity and protected status. The origin of its binomial name comes from the Greek words pseph (pebble) and phoreus (bearer of), which when combined, also shares the meaning of the Greek word psepharos (gloomy/cloudy one). Distribution, habitat and ecology A specimen of Psephurus gladius exhibited in the Museum of Hydrobiological Sciences of left The Chinese paddlefish was native to the Yangtze (Chang Jiang) River basin and its estuary at the East China Sea. Historically it was also recorded in Yellow River basin (which is connected to the Yangtze by the Grand Canal) and its estuary at the Yellow Sea. alt= Chinese paddlefish spent part of their life in the lower section of the Yangtze, including the brackish water of its estuary, but migrated up river and into major tributaries to spawn, which occurred in Spring, from mid-March to early April. They primarily inhabited the large rivers, but sometimes travelled into large lakes. Due to their anadromous nature, mature individuals were found in coastal waters of the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea, occasionally spring tides would bring individuals into the lower reaches of the Qiantang and Yangjian rivers. left These fishes were largely solitary, and occupied the lower-mid layers of the water column. They were noted for being strong swimmers. Unlike its relative the American paddlefish, which is planktivorous, the Chinese paddlefish was primarily piscivorous, primarily feeding on small to medium-sized fishes like anchovies (Coilia), cyprinids (Coreius, Rhinogobio) and gobiids (Gobius) as well as bagrids and bothids, shrimp and crab were also eaten. Research suggests that the American paddlefish uses electroreceptors located on the rostrum to detect prey. Presumably, the Chinese paddlefish possessed similar abilities, though little research had been conducted on it due to its rarity. Conservation status The Chinese paddlefish has been listed as a first-level protected animal of the People's Republic of China since 1983 and on CITES Appendix II since 1998. The species was last sighted alive in 2003, and there was one anecdotal report of a dead specimen in 2007 but it was not until 2019 that the species was reported in a published study as extinct. Wei Qiwei with the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, and co-author of a 2019 study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment reported the Chinese paddlefish extinct. However, their official status will not be updated by the IUCN until June 2020. The primary cause of its extinction was overfishing and the loss of critical habitat. Schooling young were easily caught by traditional fishing methods, therefore reducing sustainability of viable populations. Dams, notably the Gezhouba Dam and Three Gorges Dam, landlocked and divided populations, and prevented spawning migration. 17th-century depiction The last records of Chinese paddlefish in the Yellow River basin and its estuary date back to the 1960s, although declines were realized between the 13th and 19th centuries. Declines were significant throughout its primary range in the Yangtze basin, but annual captures of 25 tonnes continued in 1970s. The species was still being found in small numbers in the 1980s (for example, 32 were caught in 1985) and young were seen as recently as 1995. Since 2000, there have only been two confirmed sightings of the fish alive, both from the Yangtze basin: The first was a , female caught at Nanjing in 2002 and the second a , 160-kilogram (352 lb) female accidentally caught at Yibin, Sichuan on January 24, 2003 by fisherman Liu Longhua (ÂàòÈæôÂçé); the former died despite attempts to save it and the latter was radio-tagged and released, but the tag stopped working after only 12 hours. During a search conducted in the Yangtze basin from 2006‚Äì2008, a research team from the Chinese Academy of Fisheries Science in Jingzhou failed to catch any paddlefish, but two probable specimens were recorded with hydroacoustic signals.Zhang; Wei1, Q.W.; Du, H.; Shen, L.; Li, Y.H.; and Zhao, Y. (2009). Is there evidence that the Chinese paddlefish (Psephurus gladius) still survives in the upper Yangtze River? Concerns inferred from hydroacoustic and capture surveys, 2006‚Äì2008. Journal of Applied Ichthyology 25(s2): 95-99. DOI: 10.1111/j.1439-0426.2009.01268.x. Although very small numbers might survive, many scientists now consider the Chinese paddlefish to be extinct. A 2019 study reaffirmed the species as likely extinct following extensive capture surveys of the Yangtze between 2017 and 2018 that did not report any live specimens of the paddlefish. The paper estimated that the species went extinct between 2005 and 2010, and became functionally extinct by 1993. The study found the species' extinction to have been primarily caused by overfishing and habitat fragmentation, with one of the main contributors being the construction of the Gezhouba Dam in 1981. The paper thus recommended the reclassification of the species as Extinct by the IUCN. Prof. Wei Qiwei (Âç±Ëµ∑‰ºü) with the Yangtze River Fisheries Research Institute, and a co-author of a 2019 study published in the journal Science of the Total Environment, reported the extinction of the Chinese paddlefish on CCTV. However, their official Red List status will not be updated by the IUCN until June 2020.

It is a fairly close-knit community, with a rather liberal citizenry. The farther west one goes along the valley, the more forested the land becomes. The valley is bisected roughly east-to-west by Sir Francis Drake Boulevard; a number of streets in the towns along this road were constructed on the former right-of- way of the Northwestern Pacific Railroad. The valley has numerous hiking/biking trails. Most of the residents reside on the south, shadier, side of the valley. The San Geronimo Valley derives its name from the San Geronimo Ranch, established by Adolph Mailliard and Ann Eliza Ward in 1868, where they bred thoroughbred horses, including the famous stallion Monday, who sired most of the race horses in California. The San Geronimo Valley Community Center The Valley is part of the Lagunitas School District, unique in that it operates two alternative elementary programs and a traditional middle school program on two connected campuses with one superintendent, one principal, and one school board. Each elementary program (Open Classroom, Montessori-inspired) has its own unique philosophy and pedagogical methods, all working within the framework of the California professional and academic standards. Each program involves parent participation to some degree. The main businesses in the Valley are the Papermill Saloon in Forest Knolls, Arti Cafe, Woodacre Market and Deli, and the Lagunitas Grocery, though there are numerous others. Woodacre is home to Spirit Rock Meditation Center, dedicated to the teachings of Buddha and VipasannƒÅ mediation; Dickson Ranch, and the Marin County Fire Department headquarters. San Geronimo Valley also comprises the greater part of the Lagunitas Watershed, in which some of the last remaining coho salmon spawn. The San Geronimo Valley Community Center, attached to the school district, is a hub for community events and hosts the local food bank.

The program was designed and developed by Nigel Pearce whilst working for the monitor manufacturer Microvitec.  History  A predecessor of Creator was written for the Alhambra Theatre, Bradford in 1991. It was written in Turbo Pascal for DOS and ran on touchscreen driven PCs housed in interactive booths within the theatre foyer. The application allowed visitors to browse the program for forthcoming shows, to book seats using a visual seating plan and to look for restaurants in the locality. It was developed by Brian Lumb of Visual Solutions (Saltaire), who along with Nigel Pearce helped to implement the working solution. Much of the coding logic within the application was based upon the research by Pearce for his BSc thesis: 'Point of Information Systems' undertaken at Sheffield Hallamshire University in 1992. When Visual Solutions dissolved in 1992, Lumb brought the \\"touch interactive software: concept to Microvitec where Pearce evolved the application into a Windows based version using a mixture of the programming languages Visual Basic and C. This software became the product known as Creator. Version 1 was released in late 1993 followed by Creator Professional in 1994.David Bradwell, \\"How To Develop your own multimedia software\\", Article, What PC, Issue 74, September 1995Mike Magee, \\"From Here to Multimedia\\", Feature, Practical PC, Volume 4, Issue 6, June 1995Paul Stevens, \\"Do It Yourself Multimedia', Article, PC Plus, Issue 106, August 1995John Taylor, \\"DIY Multimedia', Feature, CD-ROM User, Issue 10, May 1995Simon Williams, \\"Creator\\", Windows Pro Choice Feature, CD-ROM Today, Issue 16, August 1995 Creator was distributed by Cosmi UK between 1994-1995. In 1995, Plymouth County Council adopted Creator as its general point of information system across the city and was implemented using a network of touch screen driven PCs connected via modems. The satellite systems received updates from the central control server on a daily basis. In 1996 Microvitec were suffering significantly in the sector and the rights to the Creator application were sold to newly formed interactive whiteboard manufacturer Promethean after Mike Lawton (the then Promethean MD) saw Creator demonstrated at Ceebit in the same year. Pearce joined Promethean at the same time. Promethean continued to maintain the Creator product and to support the user base until mid-1999. In 1997 the Creator codebase was used as the starting point for the Promethean application PandA, later Activstudio and Activprimary  Description  Creator used a \\"book and page\\" system. The \\"book\\" was a Creator file containing one or more pages where each page comprised a set of objects such as text, images and video. Each object could have up to two programmable actions which when clicked upon could link the user to another page in the book, change the appearance of another object on the page or play a video or sound file (amongst other actions). The program implemented the feature whereby each object on the page could be made to replicate itself in a defined grid formation. Additionally each object could contain a list of content references such as text strings, images or external file references which would then be automatically displayed inside the replicated objects within the grid. This feature provided the user with the ability to create interactive menus and scrollable data lists. The application could run either unattended in \\"slide show\\" mode or be driven interactively via touch screen, mouse and/or keyboard. Creator included database searching techniques via SQL queries on the book data. The program also utilised numerous page transitions and hi- resolution, true colour graphics to attract its target audience. The Creator Server extension allowed for a system administrator to update book and page content on any client machine across a LAN or to remote machines via modem dial up.

It is operated by the clapper loader. Other names include clapper, clapboard, cue card, clacker, slate, slate board, slapperboard, sync slate, time slate, sticks, board, smart slate, dumb slate and sound marker. When sound and picture are out of synchronization, there is a lip flap occurring. History Clapperboard c. 1953 In the silent era the principal requirement of film stock identification during a day's shoot was the slate. The clapper as two sticks hinged together was invented by F. W. Thring (father of actor Frank Thring), who was head of Efftee Studios in Melbourne, Australia. The clapboard with both the sticks and slate together was a refinement of Leon M. Leon (1903‚Äì1998) a pioneer sound engineer. The release of Aretha Franklin's 1972 concert film Amazing Grace was delayed for 46 years due to young Academy Award nominated director Sydney Pollack forgetting to use clapperboards, making the film impossible to edit until the advent of non-linear editing. Function The clapperboard combines a 'chalkboard slate' or acrylic board with 'filmsticks' or 'clappersticks'. The slate displays the name of the production, the scene and \\"take\\" about to be performed, and similar information; a camera assistant holds the clapperboard so the slate is in view of the cameras with the Filmsticks already open, speaks out information for the benefit of the audio recording, then claps the filmsticks shut. The shutting of the filmsticks is easily identified on the visual track, and the sharp \\"clap\\" noise is easily identified on the separate audio track. The two tracks can later be precisely synchronised by matching the sound and movement. Since each take is identified on both the visual and audio tracks, segments of film are easily matched with segments of audio. Construction A traditional wooden slate clapperboard. Traditional clapperboards consisted of a wooden slate with a hinged filmstick attached to its top. Modern clapperboards generally use a pair of wooden sticks atop either a whiteboard or a translucent acrylic glass slate (the latter being easily legible via the light coming through it from the scene about to be shot). The filmsticks traditionally have diagonally interleaved lines of black and white to ensure a clear visual of the clap in most lighting conditions. In recent years sticks with calibrated color stripes have become available. Digislates are simply clapperboards with inbuilt electronic boxes displaying SMPTE time code. The timecode displayed on the clapperboard will have been jam synced with the internal clock of the camera so it's easy for an editor to pull the timecode metadata from the video file and sound clip and synchronise them together. However, electronic timecode can drift throughout a shoot day so the Filmsticks on the clapperboard still need to be closed together in order to ensure there's a way of manually synchronising the footage and audio if matching the digital timecode fails. Operation A clapperboard in use The slate typically includes the date, the production title, the name of the director, the name of the director of photography (DoP) and the scene information ‚Äî which follows two popular systems: # American: scene number, camera angle and take number; e.g. scene 24, C, take 3; # European: slate number, take number (with the letter of the camera shooting the slate if using multiple-camera setup); e.g. slate 256, take 3C. Often, the European system will also include the scene number; however, a separate continuity sheet that maps the slate number to the scene number, camera angle and take number may be used if the scene number is not included on the slate. This is generally not as great a concern with short films, however. A verbal identification of the numbers, known either as \\"voice slate\\" or \\"announcement\\", occurs after sound has reached speed. At the same time or shortly thereafter, the camera will start running, and the clapperboard is then filmed briefly at the start of the 'take' and the filmsticks are clapped sharply as soon as the camera has reached sync speed. Specific procedures vary depending on the nature of the production (documentary, television, feature, commercial, etc.), and the dominant camera assisting regional conventions. A clapper board is generally used to identify all takes on a production, even takes that do not require synchronization, such as MOS takes, which have no sound. When a slate is used to mark an MOS take, the slate is held half open, with a hand blocking the sticks, or closed, with a hand over the sticks. =Operator= The clapper loader (or 2nd AC) is generally responsible for the maintenance and operation of the clapperboard, while the script supervisor is responsible for determining which system will be used and what numbers a given take should have. While these are usually fairly obvious once a system has been agreed upon, the script supervisor is usually considered the final arbiter in the event of an unclear situation. =Alternatives= Sometimes a \\"tail slate\\" or end slate is filmed at the end of a take, during which the clapperboard is held upside-down. This is done when the slate was not captured at the start of the take due to the camera being set up for the shot in such a way that the board cannot be captured, for example when a specific focus or frame is set up and cannot be altered until the take is complete. Tail slates are also commonly used when the director makes the decision that clapping a slate at the beginning of the scene would be distracting to the actor, such as when filming a highly emotional performance.

He was born into a noble family, but the political and economic difficulties faced by the island as a colony of the Spanish Empire during the Latin American wars of independence meant that his household was poor. Cofres√≠ worked at sea from an early age which familiarized him with the region's geography, but it provided only a modest salary, and he eventually decided to abandon the sailor's life and became a pirate. He had previous links to land-based criminal activities, but the reason for Cofres√≠'s change of vocation is unknown; historians speculate that he may have worked as a privateer aboard El Scipi√≥n, a ship owned by one of his cousins. At the height of his career, Cofres√≠ evaded capture by vessels from Spain, Gran Colombia, the United Kingdom, Denmark, France, and the United States. He commanded several small-draft vessels, the best known a fast six-gun sloop named Anne, and he had a preference for speed and maneuverability over firepower. He manned them with small, rotating crews which most contemporaneous documents numbered at 10 to 20. He preferred to outrun his pursuers, but his flotilla engaged the West Indies Squadron twice, attacking the schooners USS Grampus and USS Beagle. Most crew members were recruited locally, although men occasionally joined them from the other Antilles, Central America, and Europe. He never confessed to murder, but he reportedly boasted about his crimes, and 300 to 400 people died as a result of his pillaging, mostly foreigners. Cofres√≠ proved too much for local authorities, who accepted international help to capture the pirate; Spain created an alliance with the West Indies Squadron and the Danish government of Saint Thomas. On March 5, 1825, the alliance set a trap which forced Anne into a naval battle. After 45 minutes, Cofres√≠ abandoned his ship and escaped overland; he was recognized by a resident who ambushed and injured him. Cofres√≠ was captured and imprisoned, making a last unsuccessful attempt to escape by trying to bribe an official with part of a hidden stash. The pirates were sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico, where a brief military tribunal found them guilty and sentenced them to death. On March 29, 1825, Cofres√≠ and most of his crew were executed by firing squad. He inspired stories and myths after his death, most emphasizing a Robin Hood-like \\"steal from the rich, give to the poor\\" philosophy which became associated with him. This portrayal has grown into legend, commonly accepted as fact in Puerto Rico and throughout the West Indies. Some of these claim that Cofres√≠ became part of the Puerto Rican independence movement and other secessionist initiatives, including Sim√≥n Bol√≠var's campaign against Spain. Historical and mythical accounts of his life have inspired songs, poems, plays, books, and films. In Puerto Rico, caves, beaches, and other alleged hideouts or locations of buried treasure have been named after Cofres√≠, and a resort town is named for him near Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic. Early years =Lineage= The Kupferschein family's coat of arms (1549). In 1945, historian Enrique Ram√≠rez Brau speculated that Cofres√≠ may have had Jewish ancestry. A theory, held by David Cuesta and historian Ursula Acosta (a member of the Puerto Rican Genealogy Society), held that the name Kupferstein (\\"copper stone\\") may have been chosen by his family when the 18th-century European Jewish population adopted surnames. The theory was later discarded when their research uncovered a complete family tree prepared by Cofres√≠'s cousin, Luigi de Jenner, indicating that their name was spelled Kupferschein (not Kupferstein). Originally from Prague, Cofres√≠ paternal patriarch Cristoforo Kupferschein received a recognition and coat of arms from Ferdinand I of Austria in December 1549 and eventually moved to Trieste. His last name was probably adapted from the town of Kufstein. After its arrival, the family became one of Trieste's early settlers. Cristoforo's son Felice was recognized as a noble in 1620, becoming Edler von Kupferschein. The family gained prestige and became one of the city's wealthiest, with the next generation receiving the best possible education and marrying into other influential families. Cofres√≠'s grandfather, Giovanni Giuseppe Stanislao de Kupferschein, held several offices in the police, military and municipal administration. According to Acosta, Cofres√≠'s father Francesco Giuseppe Fortunato von Kupferschein received a lateinschule education and left at age 19 for Frankfurt (probably in search of a university or legal practice). In Frankfurt he mingled with influential figures such as Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, returning to Trieste two years later. As a cosmopolitan, mercantile city Trieste was a probable hub of illicit trade, and Francesco was forced to leave after he killed Josephus Steffani on July 31, 1778. Although Steffani's death is commonly attributed to a duel, given their acquaintanceship (both worked at a criminal court) it may have been related to illegal activity. Francesco's name and those of four sailors soon became linked to the murder. Convicted in absentia, the fugitive remained in touch with his family. Francesco went to Barcelona, reportedly learning Spanish there. By 1784 he had settled in Cabo Rojo, Puerto Rico, a harbor town recently separated from the municipality of San Germ√°n and made the seat of an eponymous municipality, where he was accepted by the local aristocracy with the Spanish honorific Don (\\"of noble origin\\"). Francesco's name was Hispanicized to Francisco Jos√© Cofres√≠ (his third given name was not), which was easier for his neighbors to pronounce. Since he was linked to illegal commerce in his homeland, he probably relocated to Cabo Rojo for strategic reasons; its harbor was far from San Juan, the capital. Francisco soon met Mar√≠a Germana Ram√≠rez de Arellano y Segarra, and they married. His wife was born to Clemente Ram√≠rez de Arellano y del Toro y Qui√±ones Rivera, a noble and first cousin of town founder Nicol√°s Ram√≠rez de Arellano y Mart√≠nez de Matos. Her paternal family, descended from the Jimena royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Navarre and the first royal house of the Kingdom of Arag√≥n (said house was established by a Jimena prince), owned a significant amount of land in Cabo Rojo. After their marriage the couple settled in El Tujao (or El Tujado), near the coast. Francisco's father Giovanni died in 1789, and a petition pardoning him for Steffani's murder a decade before was granted two years later (enabling him to return to Trieste). However, no evidence exists that Francisco ever returned to the city. =Penniless nobleman and marauder= The Latin American wars of independence had repercussions in Puerto Rico; due to widespread privateering and other naval warfare, maritime commerce suffered heavily. Cabo Rojo was among the municipalities affected most, with its ports at a virtual standstill. African slaves took to the sea in an attempt at freedom; merchants were assessed higher taxes and harassed by foreigners. Under these conditions, Cofres√≠ was born to Francisco and Mar√≠a Germana. The youngest of four children, he had one sister (Juana) and two brothers (Juan Francisco and Juan Ignacio). Cofres√≠ was baptized into the Catholic Church by Jos√© de Roxas, the first priest in Cabo Rojo, when he was fifteen days old. Mar√≠a died when Cofres√≠ was four years old, and an aunt assumed his upbringing. Francisco then began a relationship with Mar√≠a Sanabria, the mother of his last child Juli√°n. A don by birth, Cofres√≠'s education was above average; since there is no evidence of a school in Cabo Rojo at that time, Francisco may have educated his children or hired a tutor. The Cofres√≠s, raised in a multicultural environment, probably knew Dutch and Italian. In November 1814 Francisco died, leaving a modest estate; Roberto was probably homeless, with no income. On January 14, 1815, three months after his father's death, Cofres√≠ married Juana Creitoff in San Miguel Arc√°ngel parish, Cabo Rojo. Contemporary documents are unclear about her birthplace; although it is also listed as Cura√ßao, she was probably born in Cabo Rojo to Dutch parents. After their marriage, the couple moved to a residence bought for 50 pesos by Creitoff's father, Geraldo. Months later Cofres√≠'s father in-law lost his humble home in a fire, plunging the family into debt. Three years after his marriage Cofres√≠ owned no property and lived with his mother-in-law, Anna Cordelia. He established ties with residents of San Germ√°n, including his brothers-in-law: the wealthy merchant Don Jacobo Ufret and Don Manuel Ufret. The couple struggled to begin a family of their own, conceiving two sons (Juan and Francisco Mat√≠as) who died soon after birth. Although he belonged to a prestigious family, Cofres√≠ was not wealthy. In 1818 he paid 17 maraved√≠s in taxes, spending most of his time at sea and earning a low wage. According to historian Walter Cardona Bonet, Cofres√≠ probably worked in a number of fishing corrals in Boquer√≥n Bay. The corrals belonged to the aristocrat Crist√≥bal Pab√≥n D√°vila, a friend of municipal port captain Jos√© Mendoza. This connection is believed to have later protected Cofres√≠, since Mendoza was godfather to several of his brother Juan Francisco's children. The following year he first appeared on a government registry as a sailor, and there is no evidence linking him to any other jobs in Cabo Rojo. Although Cofres√≠'s brothers were maritime merchants and sailed a boat, Avispa, he probably worked as an able fisherman. On December 28, 1819 Cofres√≠ was registered on Ramona, ferrying goods between the southern municipalities. In addition, her frequent voyages to the Mona Passage and Cofres√≠'s recognition by local residents indicate that he occasionally accompanied Avispa That year, Cofres√≠ and Juana lived in Barrio del Pueblo and paid higher taxes than the previous year: five reales. Political changes in Spain affected Puerto Rico's stability during the first two decades of the 19th century. Europeans and refugees from the American colonies began arriving after the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815, changing the archipelago's economic and political environments. With strategic acquisitions, the new arrivals triggered a rise in prices. Food distribution was inefficient, particularly in non-agricultural areas. Unmotivated and desperate, the local population drifted toward crime and dissipation. By 1816, governor Salvador Mel√©ndez Bruna shifted responsibility for law enforcement from the Captaincy General of Puerto Rico to the mayors. Driven by hunger and poverty, highway robbers continued to roam southern and central Puerto Rico. In 1817 wealthy San Germ√°n residents requested help with the criminals, who were invading houses and shops. The following year, Mel√©ndez established a high-security prison at El Arsenal in San Juan. During the next few years, the governor transferred repeat offenders to San Juan. Cabo Rojo, with its high crime rate, also dealt with civil strife, inefficient law enforcement and corrupt officials. While he was still a don, Cofres√≠ led a criminal gang in San Germ√°n which stole cattle, food and crops. He was linked to an organization operating near the Hormigueros barrio since at least 1818 and to another nobleman, Juan Geraldo Bey. Among Cofres√≠'s associates were Juan de los Reyes, Jos√© Cartagena and Francisco Ramos, and the criminals continued to thrive in 1820. The situation worsened with the arrival of unauthorized street vendors from nearby municipalities, who were soon robbed. A series of storms and droughts drove residents away from Cabo Rojo, worsening the already-poor economy; authorities retrained the unemployed and underemployed as night watchmen. The regional harvest was destroyed by a September 28, 1820 hurricane, triggering the region's largest crime wave to date. Newly appointed Puerto Rican governor Gonzalo Ar√≥stegui Herrera immediately ordered Lieutenant Antonio Ord√≥√±ez to round up as many criminals as possible. On November 22, 1820, a group of fifteen men from Cabo Rojo participated in the highway robbery of Francisco de Rivera, Nicol√°s Vald√©s and Francisco Lamboy on the outskirts of Yauco. Cofres√≠ is believed to have been involved in this incident because of its timing and the criminals' link to an area headed by his friend, Crist√≥bal Pab√≥n D√°vila. The incident sparked an uproar in towns throughout the region, and convinced the governor that the authorities were conspiring with the criminals. Among measures taken by Ar√≥stegui were a mayoral election in Cabo Rojo (Juan Evangelista Ram√≠rez de Arellano, one of Cofres√≠'s relatives, was elected) and an investigation of the former mayor. The incoming mayor was ordered to control crime in the region, an unrealistic demand with the resources at his disposal. Bernardo Pab√≥n Davila, a friend of Cofres√≠ and relative of Crist√≥bal, was assigned to prosecute the Yauco incident. Bernardo reportedly protected the accused and argued against pursuing the case, saying that according to \\"private confidences\\" they were fleeing to the United States. Other initiatives to capture highway robbers in Cabo Rojo were more successful, resulting in over a dozen arrests; among them was the nobleman Bey, who was charged with murder. Known as \\"El Holand√©s\\", Bey testified that Cofres√≠ led a criminal gang. Cofres√≠'s primary collaborators were the Ram√≠rez de Arellano family, who prevented his capture as Cabo Rojo's founding family with high positions in politics and law enforcement. The central government issued wanted posters for Cofres√≠, and in July 1821 he and the rest of his gang were captured; Bey escaped, becoming a fugitive. Cofres√≠ and his men were tried in San Germ√°n's courthouse, where their connection to several crimes was proven. On August 17, 1821 (while Cofres√≠ was in prison) Juana gave birth to their only daughter, Bernardina. Due to his noble status, Cofres√≠ probably received a pass for the birth and took the opportunity to escape; in alternative theories, he broke out or was released on parole. While Cofres√≠ was a fugitive, Bernardo Pab√≥n Davila was Bernardina's godfather and Fel√≠cita Asencio her godmother. On December 4, 1821, a wanted poster was circulated by San Germ√°n mayor Pascacio Cardona. There is little documentation of Cofres√≠'s whereabouts in 1822. Historians have suggested that he exploited his upper- class connections to remain concealed; the Ram√≠rez de Arellano family held most regional public offices, and their influence extended beyond the region. Other wealthy families, including the Beys, had similarly protected their relatives and Cofres√≠ may have hidden in plain sight due to the inertia of Cabo Rojo authorities. When he became a wanted man, he moved Juana and Anna to her brothers' houses and would visit in secret; Juana also visited him at his headquarters in the rural ward of Pedernales in Cabo Rojo. It is unknown how far Cofres√≠ traveled during this time, but he had associates on the east coast and may have taken advantage of eastern migration from Cabo Rojo. Although he may have been captured and imprisoned in San Juan, he does not appear in contemporary records. However, Cofres√≠'s associates Juan \\"El Indio\\" de los Reyes, Francisco Ramos and Jos√© \\"Pepe\\" Cartagena were released only months before his recorded reappearance. \\"Last of the West India pirates\\" =Establishing a reputation= By 1823 Cofres√≠ was probably on the crew of the corsair barquentine El Scipi√≥n, captained by Jos√© Ram√≥n Torres and managed by his cousin (the first mayor of Mayag√ºez, Jos√© Mar√≠a Ram√≠rez de Arellano). Historians agree, since several of his friends and family members benefited from the sale of stolen goods. Cofres√≠ may have joined to evade the authorities, honing skills he would use later in life. El Scipi√≥n employed questionable tactics later associated with the pirate, such as flying the flag of Gran Colombia so other ships would lower their guard (as she did in capturing the British frigate Aurora and the American brigantine Otter). The capture of Otter led to a court order requiring restitution, affecting the crew. At this time, Cofres√≠ turned to piracy. Although the reasons behind his decision are unclear, several theories have been proposed by researchers. In Or√≠genes portorrique√±os Ram√≠rez Brau speculates that Cofres√≠'s time aboard El Scipi√≥n, or seeing a family member become a privateer, may have influenced his decision to become a pirate after the crew's pay was threatened by the lawsuit. According to Acosta, a lack of work for privateers ultimately pushed Cofres√≠ into piracy. The timing of this decision was crucial in establishing him as the dominant Caribbean pirate of the era. Cofres√≠ began his new career in early 1823, filling a role vacant in the Spanish Main since the death of Jean Lafitte, and was the last major target of West Indies anti-piracy operations. While piracy was heavily monitored and most pirates were rarely successful, Cofres√≠ was confirmed to have plundered at least eight vessels and has been credited with over 70 captures. Unlike his predecessors, Cofres√≠ is not known to have imposed a pirate code on his crew; his leadership was enhanced by an audacious personality, a trait acknowledged even by his pursuers. According to 19th-century reports he had a rule of engagement that when a vessel was captured, only those willing to join his crew were permitted to live. Cofres√≠'s influence extended to a large number of civil informants and associates, forming a network which took 14 years after his death to fully dismantle. The earliest document linked to Cofres√≠'s modus operandi is a letter dated July 5, 1823, from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico which was published in the St. Thomas Gazette. The letter reported that a brigantine, loaded with coffee and West Indian indigo from La Guaira, was boarded by pirates on June 12. The hijackers ordered the ship brought to Isla de Mona (incorrectly anglicized as \\"Monkey Island\\"), a small island in the eponymous passage between Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, where its captain and crew were ordered to unload the cargo. After this was done, the pirates reportedly killed the sailors and sank the brigantine. Both of Cofres√≠'s brothers were soon involved in his operation, helping him move plunder and deal with captured ships. Juan Francisco was able to gather information about maritime traffic in his work at the port, presumably forwarding it to his brother. The pirates communicated with their cohorts through coastal signs, and their associates on land warned them of danger; the system was probably used to identify loaded vessels as well. According to Puerto Rican historian Aurelio Ti√≥, Cofres√≠ shared his loot with the needy (especially family members and close friends) and was considered the Puerto Rican equivalent of Robin Hood.Puerto Rican Folkloric Dance, Retrieved April 2, 2008 Acosta disagrees, saying that any acts of generosity were probably opportunistic. Cardona Bonet's research suggests that Cofres√≠ organized improvised markets in Cabo Rojo, where plunder would be informally sold; according to this theory, merchant families would buy goods for resale to the public. The process was facilitated by local collaborators, such as French smuggler Juan Bautista Buy√©. On October 28, 1823, months after the El Scipi√≥n case was settled, Cofres√≠ attacked a ship registered to the harbor of Patillas and robbed the small fishing boat of 800 pesos in cash. Cofres√≠ attacked with other members of his gang and that of another pirate, Manuel Lamparo, who was connected to British pirate Samuel McMorren (also known as Juan Bron). That week he also led the capture of John, an American schooner. Out of Newburyport and captained by Daniel Knight, on its way to Mayag√ºez the ship was intercepted by a ten-ton schooner armed with a swivel gun near Desecheo Island. Cofres√≠'s group, consisting of seven pirates armed with sabers and muskets, stole $1,000 in cash, tobacco, tar and other provisions and the vessel's square rig and mainsail. Cofres√≠ ordered the crew to head for Santo Domingo, threatening to kill everyone aboard if they were seen at any Puerto Rican port. Despite the threat, Knight went to Mayag√ºez and reported the incident. Map of the area where Cofres√≠ and his men usually operated: Puerto Rico, Mona, Vieques (Crab Island), Culebra, Saona, Hispaniola and Saint Thomas It was soon established that some of the pirates were from Cabo Rojo, since they disembarked there. Undercover agents were sent to the town to track them, and new mayor Juan Font y Soler requested resources to deal with a larger group which was out of control. Links between the pirates and local sympathizers made arresting them difficult. The central government, frustrated with Cabo Rojo's inefficiency, demanded the pirates' capture and western Puerto Rico military commander Jos√© Rivas was ordered to exert pressure on local authorities. Although Cofres√≠ was tracked to the beach in Pe√±ones, near his brothers' homes in Guaniquilla, the operation only recovered the Johns sails, meat, flour, cheese, lard, butter and candles; the pirates escaped aboard a schooner. A detachment caught Juan Jos√© Mateu and charged him with conspiracy; his confession linked Cofres√≠ to the two hijackings. Cofres√≠'s sudden success was an oddity, nearly a century after the end of the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint governmental efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofres√≠ to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often there. This base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola. In November a number of sailors aboard El Scipi√≥n took advantage of her officers' shore leave and mutinied, seizing control of the ship. The vessel, repurposed as a pirate ship, began operating in the Mona Passage and was later seen at Mayag√ºez before disappearing from the record. Cofres√≠ was linked to El Scipi√≥n by pirate Jaime M√°rquez, who admitted under police questioning on Saint Thomas that boatswain Manuel Reyes Paz was a Cofres√≠ associate. The confession hints that the ship was captured by Hispaniola authorities. Cofres√≠ is recorded in eastern Hispaniola (then part of the unified Republic of Haiti, modern-day Dominican Republic), where his crew reportedly rested off Puerto Plata province. On one excursion, the pirates were intercepted by Spanish patrol boats off the coast of Saman√° Province. With no apparent escape route, Cofres√≠ is said to have ordered the vessel's sinking and it sailed into Bah√≠a de Saman√° before coming to rest near the town of Punta Gorda. This created a diversion, allowing him and his crew to escape in skiffs they rowed to shore and adjacent wetlands (where the larger Spanish ships could not follow). The remains of the ship, reportedly full of plunder, have not been found. In an article in the May 9, 1936 issue of Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Eugenio Astol described an 1823 incident between Cofres√≠ and Puerto Rican physician and politician Pedro Ger√≥nimo Goyco. The 15-year-old Goyco traveled alone on a schooner to a Santo Domingo school for his secondary education. In mid-voyage, Cofres√≠ intercepted the ship and the pirates boarded it. Cofres√≠ assembled the passengers, asking their names and those of their parents. When he learned that Goyco was among them, the pirate ordered a change of course; they landed on a beach near Mayag√ºez, where Goyco was freed. Cofres√≠ explained that he knew Goyco's father, an immigrant from Herceg Novi named Ger√≥nimo Goicovich who had settled in Mayag√ºez. Goyco returned home safely, later attempting the voyage again. The elder Goicovich had favored members of Cofres√≠'s family, despite their association with a pirate. Goyco grew up to become a militant abolitionist, similar to Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis. Cofres√≠'s actions quickly gained the attention of the Anglo-American nations, who called him \\"Cofrecinas\\" (a mistranslated, onomatopoeic variant of his last name). Commercial agent and ambassador to the United States Judah Lord wrote to John Quincy Adams (then United States Secretary of State) describing the El Scipi√≥n situation and the capture of John. Adams relayed the information to Commodore David Porter, leader of the anti-piracy West Indies Squadron, who sent several ships to Puerto Rico. On November 27 Cofres√≠ sailed from his base on Mona with two sloops (armed with pivot gun cannons) and assaulted another American ship, the brigantine William Henry. The Salem Gazette reported that the following month a schooner sailed from Santo Domingo to Saona, capturing 18 pirates (including Manuel Reyes Paz) and a \\"considerable quantity\\" of leather, coffee, indigo and cash. =International manhunt= Cofres√≠'s victims were locals and foreigners, and the region was economically destabilized. When he boarded Spanish vessels he usually targeted immigrants brought by the royal decree of 1815, ignoring his fellow criollos. The situation was complicated by several factors, most of them geopolitical. The Spanish Empire had lost most of its possessions in the New World, and her last two territories (Puerto Rico and Cuba) faced economic problems and political unrest. To undermine the commerce of former colonies, Spain stopped issuing letters of marque; this left sailors unemployed, and they gravitated towards Cofres√≠ and piracy. On the diplomatic front, the pirates assaulted foreign ships while flying the Flag of Spain (angering nations who had reached an agreement about the return of ships captured by corsairs and compensation for losses). Aware that the problem had developed international overtones, Spanish-appointed governor of Puerto Rico Lt. Gen. Miguel Luciano de la Torre y Pando (1822‚Äì1837) made Cofres√≠'s capture a priority. By December 1823 other nations joined the effort to combat Cofres√≠, sending warships to the Mona Passage. Gran Colombia sent two corvettes, Bocay√° and Bol√≠var, under the command of former privateer and Jean Lafitte associate Renato Beluche. The British assigned the brig-sloop to the region after the William Henry incident. On January 23, 1824, de la Torre implemented anti-piracy measures in response to Spanish losses and political pressure from the United States, ordering that pirates be tried in a military tribunal with the defendants considered enemy combatants. De la Torre ordered the pursuit of pirates, bandits, and those aiding them, issuing medals, certificates and bounties in gold and silver as rewards. Manuel Lamparo was captured on Puerto Rico's east coast, and some of his crew joined Cofres√≠ and other fugitives. United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard ordered David Porter to assign ships to the Mona Passage, and the commodore sent the schooner and the brigantine . The ships were to investigate the zone, gathering information at Saint Barth√©lemy and St. Thomas with the goal of destroying the base at Mona. Although Porter warned that the pirates were reportedly well-armed and -supplied, he said the crews would probably not find plunder at the base because of the proximity of eastern Puerto Rican ports. On February 8, 1824, the Spark arrived at Mona, conducted reconnaissance and landed. A suspicious schooner was seen, but captain John T. Newton decided not to chase her. The crew found a small settlement with an empty hut and other buildings, a chest of medicine, sails, books, an anchor and documents from William Henry. Newton ordered the base and a large canoe found in the vicinity destroyed, and reported his findings to the Secretary of the Navy. According to another report, the ship sent was the USS Beagle; in this account, several pirates eluded the Beagles crew. Undeterred, Cofres√≠ quickly resettled on Mona. Attacks on two brigantines were reported by Renato Beluche on February 12, 1824, and published in El Colombiano several days later. The first was Boniton, captained by Alexander Murdock, which sailed with a load of cocoa from Trinidad and was intercepted en route to Gibraltar. The second, Bonne Sophie, sailed from Havre de Grace under the command of a man named Chevanche with dry goods bound for Martinique. In both cases, the sailors were beaten and imprisoned and the ships plundered. The ships were part of a convoy escorted by the Bol√≠var off Puerto Real, Cabo Rojo, and Cofres√≠ captained a ship identified by Beluche as a pailebot (a small schooner). Although Bol√≠var could not capture her, her crew described the vessel as painted black, armed with a rotating cannon and having a crew of twenty unidentified Puerto Rican men. Cofres√≠ was presumably leading the vessels to dock at Pedernales, where Mendoza and his brother could facilitate the distribution of loot with the aid of official inertia. From there, other associates usually used Boquer√≥n Bay for transportation and ensured that the loot reached stores in Cabo Rojo and nearby towns. In this region Cofres√≠'s influence extended to government and the military, with the Ram√≠rez de Arellano family involved in the smuggling and sale of his loot. On land the loot, hidden in sacks and barrels, was brought to Mayag√ºez, Hormigueros or San Germ√°n for distribution. When Beluche returned to Colombia, he published an article critical of the situation in the press. La Gaceta de Puerto Rico countered, accusing him of stealing Bonne Sophie and connecting him to the pirates. On February 16, 1824, de la Torre mandated a more-aggressive pursuit and prosecution of pirates. In March the governor ordered a search for the schooner Caballo Blanco, reportedly used in the boarding of Boniton and Bonne Sophie and similar attacks. In private communication with Mayag√ºez military commander Jos√© Rivas, he asked Rivas to find someone trustworthy who could launch a mission to capture \\"the so-called Cofresin\\" and to notify him personally of the pirate's arrest. Authorizing the use of force, the governor described Cofres√≠ as \\"one of the evil ones that I am pursuing\\" and acknowledged that the pirate was protected by Cabo Rojo authorities. The mayor was unable (or unwilling) to cooperate, despite orders from de la Torre. Rivas tracked Cofres√≠ to his house twice, but found it empty. When the captain lost contact with the pirate and his wife, he was also unable to communicate with the mayor. A similar search was undertaken in San Germ√°n, whose mayor reported to de la Torre on March 12, 1824. Martinique governor Fran√ßois-Xavier Donzelot wrote to de la Torre on March 22, concerned about the capture of Bonne Sophie and the impact of piracy on maritime commerce. This brought France into the search for Cofres√≠; on March 23 de la Torre authorized France to patrol the Puerto Rican coast and commissioned a frigate, Flora. The mission was led by a military commander named Mallet, who was ordered to the west coast and pursue the pirates \\"until he [was] able to trap and destroy them\\". Although Flora arrived three days after the operation's approval, the attempt was unsuccessful. Rivas then assigned Joaqu√≠n Arroyo, a retired Pedernales militiaman, to monitor activity near Cofres√≠'s house. 1824 wanted poster, offering a bounty in gold and silver for Cofres√≠'s capture In April 1824, Rinc√≥n mayor Pedro Garc√≠a authorized the sale of a vessel owned by Juan Bautista de Salas to Pedro Ram√≠rez. Ram√≠rez, who may have been a member of the Ram√≠rez de Arellano family, lived in Pedernales and was a neighbor of Cofres√≠'s brothers and Cristobal Pab√≥n Davila. On April 30, shortly after acquiring the ship, Ram√≠rez sold it to Cofres√≠ (who used it as a pirate flagship). The irregularity of the transactions was quickly noticed, prompting an investigation of Garc√≠a. The scandal weakened his already-frail authority, and Mat√≠as Conchuela intervened as the governor's representative. De la Torre asked the mayor of A√±asco, Thom√°s de la Concha, to retrieve the records and verify their accuracy. The investigation, led by public prosecutor Jos√© Madrazo of the Regimiento de Granada's Military Anti-Piracy Commission, concluded with Bautista's imprisonment and sanctions for Garc√≠a. Several members of the Ram√≠rez de Arellano family were prosecuted, including the former mayors of A√±asco and Mayag√ºez (Manuel and Jos√© Mar√≠a), T√≥mas and Antonio. Others with the same last name but unclear parentage, such as Juan Lorenzo Ramirez, were also linked to Cofres√≠. A number of unsuccessful searches were carried out in Cabo Rojo by an urban militia led by Captain Carlos de Espada, and additional searches were made in San Germ√°n. On May 23, 1824, the Mayag√ºez military commander prepared two vessels and sent them to Pedernales in response to reported sightings of Cofres√≠. Rivas and the military captain of Mayag√ºez, Cayetano Castillo y Picado, boarded a ship commanded by Sergeant Sebasti√°n Baus√°. Sailor Pedro Alac√°n, best known as the grandfather of Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances and a neighbor of Cofres√≠, was captain of the second schooner. The expedition failed, only finding a military deserter named Manuel Fern√°ndez de C√≥rdova. Also known as Manuel Navarro, Fern√°ndez was connected to Cofres√≠ through Lucas Branstan (a merchant from Trieste who was involved in Bonne Sophie incident). In the meantime, the pirates fled toward southern Puerto Rico. Poorly supplied after his hasty retreat, Cofres√≠ docked at Jobos Bay on June 2, 1824; about a dozen pirates invaded the hacienda of Francisco Antonio Ortiz, stealing his cattle. The group then broke into a second estate, owned by Jacinto Texidor, stole plantains and resupplied their ship. It is now believed that Juan Jos√© Mateu gave the pirates refuge in one of his haciendas, near Jobos Bay. The next day the news reached Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes, who quickly contacted the military and requested operations by land and sea. He was told that there were not enough weapons in the municipality for a mission of that scale. Brenes then requested supplies from Patillas, which rushed him twenty guns. However, the pirates fled the municipality and traveled west. On June 9, 1824, Cofres√≠ led an assault on the schooner San Jos√© y Las Animas off the coast of Tallaboa in Pe√±uelas. The ship was en route between Saint Thomas and Guayanilla with over 6,000 pesos' worth of dry goods for F√©lix and Miguel Mattei, who were aboard. The Mattei brothers are now thought to have been anti-establishment smugglers related to Henri La Fayette Villaume Ducoudray Holstein and the Ducoudray Holstein Expedition. The schooner, owned by Santos Lucca, sailed with captain Francisco Ocasio and a crew of four. Frequently used to transport cargo throughout the southern region and Saint Thomas, she made several trips to Cabo Rojo. When Cofres√≠ began the chase, Ocasio headed landward; the brothers abandoned ship and swam ashore, from where they watched the ship's plundering. Portugu√©s was second-in-command during the boarding of San Jos√© y las Animas, and Joaqu√≠n \\"El Campechano\\" Hern√°ndez was a crew member. The pirates took most of the merchandise, leaving goods valued at 418 pesos, three reales and 26 maravedi. Governor Miguel de la Torre was visiting nearby municipalities at the time, which occupied the authorities. Cargo from San Jos√© y Las Animas (clothing belonging to the brothers and a painting) was later found at Cabo Rojo. Days later, a sloop and a small boat commanded by Luis S√°nchez and Francisco Guilfuchi left Guayama in search of Cofres√≠. Unable to find him, they returned on June 19, 1824. Patillas and Guayama enacted measures, monitored by the governor, which were intended to prevent further visits. De la Torre continued his tour of the municipalities, ordering Rivas to focus on the Cabo Rojo area when he reached Mayag√ºez. The task was given to Lieutenant Antonio Madrona, leader of the Mayag√ºez garrison. Madrona assembled troops and left for Cabo Rojo, launching an operation on June 17 which ended with the arrest of pirate Eustaquio Ventura de Luciano at the home of Juan Francisco. The troops came close to capturing a second associate, Joaqu√≠n \\"El Maracaybero\\" G√≥mez. Madrona then began a surprise attack at Pedernales, finding Cofres√≠ and several associates (including Juan Bey, his brother Ignacio and his brother-in-law Juan Francisco Creitoff). The pirates' only option was to flee on foot. The Cofres√≠ brothers escaped, but Creitoff and Bey were captured and tried in San Germ√°n. Troops later visited Creitoff's house, where they found Cofres√≠'s wife and mother-in-law. Under questioning, the women confirmed the brothers' identities. The authorities continued searching the homes of those involved and those of their families, where they found quantities of plunder hidden and prepared for sale. Madrona also found burned loot on a nearby hill. Juan Francisco Cofres√≠, Ventura de Luciano and Creitoff were sent to San Juan with other suspected associates. Of this group the pirate's brother, Luis de R√≠o and Juan Bautista Buy√© were prosecuted as accomplices instead of pirates. Ignacio was later arrested and also charged as an accomplice. The Mattei brothers filed a claim against shopkeeper Francisco Betances that some of his merchandise was cargo from San Jos√© y Las Animas. In response to a tip, Jos√© Mendoza and Rivas organized an expedition to Mona. On June 22, 1824, Pedro Alac√°n assembled a party of eight volunteers (among them Joaqu√≠n Arroyo, possibly Mendoza's source). He loaned a small sailboat he co- owned (Avispa, once used by Cofres√≠'s brothers) to Jos√© P√©rez Mendoza and Antonio Gueyh. There were eight volunteers, The locally coordinated operation intended to ambush and apprehend Cofres√≠ in his hideout. The expedition left the coast of Cabo Rojo with Action Stations in place. Despite unfavorable sea conditions, the party arrived at their destination. However, as soon as they disembarked Avispa was lost. Although most of the pirates were captured without incident, Cofres√≠'s second in-command Juan Portugu√©s was shot to death in the back and dismembered by crewmember Lorenzo Camareno. Among the captives was a man identified as Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, but Cofres√≠ was not with his crew. Five days later, they returned to Cabo Rojo on a ship confiscated from the pirates with weapons, three prisoners and Portugu√©s' head and right hand (probably for identification when claiming the bounty). Rivas contacted de la Torre, informing him of further measures to track the pirates. The governor publicized the expedition, writing an account which was published in the government newspaper La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico on July 9, 1824. Alac√°n was honored by the Spanish government, receiving the ship recovered from the pirates as compensation for the loss of the Avispa. Mendoza and the crew were also honored. Cofres√≠ reportedly escaped in one of his ships with \\"Campechano\\" Hern√°ndez, resuming his attacks soon after the ambush. Shortly after the Mona expedition, Ponce mayor Jos√© Ort√≠z de la Renta began his own search for Cofres√≠. On June 30, 1824, the schooner Uni√≥n left with 42 sailors commanded by captain Francisco Francheschi. After three days, the search was abandoned and the ship returned to Ponce. The governor enacted more measures to capture the pirates, including the commission of gunboats. De la Torre ordered the destruction of any hut or abandoned ship which might aid Cofres√≠ in his escape attempts, an initiative carried out on the coasts of several municipalities. Again acting on the basis of information obtained by interrogation, the authorities tracked the pirates during the first week of July. Although Jos√© \\"Pepe\\" Cartagena (a local mulatto) and Juan Geraldo Bey were found in Cabo Rojo and San Germ√°n respectively, Cofres√≠ avoided the troops. On July 6, 1824, Cartagena resisted arrest and was killed in a shootout, with the developments again featured in La Gaceta del Gobierno de Puerto Rico. During the next few weeks, a joint initiative by Rivas and the west coast mayors led to the arrest of Cofres√≠ associates Gregorio del Rosario, Miguel Hern√°ndez, Felipe Carnero, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez, G√≥mez, Roberto Francisco Reifles, Sebasti√°n Gallardo, Francisco Ramos, Jos√© Vicente and a slave of Juan Nicol√°s Bey (Juan Geraldo's father) known as Pablo. However, the pirate again evaded the net. In his confession, Pablo testified that Juan Geraldo Bey was an accomplice of Cofres√≠. Sebasti√°n Gallardo was captured on July 13, 1824, and tried as a collaborator. The defendants were transported to San Juan, where they were prosecuted by Madrazo in a military tribunal overseen by the governor. The trial was plagued by irregularities, including G√≥mez' allegation that the public attorney had accepted a bribe of 300 pesos from Juan Francisco. During the searches, the pirates stole a \\"sturdy, copper- plated boat\\" from Cabo Rojo and escaped. The ship was originally stolen in San Juan by Gregorio Pereza and Francisco P√©rez (both arrested during the search for Caballo Blanco) and given to Cofres√≠. When the news became public, mayor Jos√© Mar√≠a Hurtado asked local residents for help. On August 5, 1824, Antonio de Irizarry found the boat at Punta Arenas, a cape in the Joyuda barrio. The mayor quickly organized his troops, reaching the location on horseback. Aboard the ship they found three rifles, three guns, a carbine, a cannon, ammunition and supplies. After an unsuccessful search of nearby woods, the mayor sailed the craft to Pedernales and turned it over to Mendoza. A group left behind continued the search, but did not find anyone. Assuming that the pirates had fled inland, Hurtado alerted his colleagues in the region about the find. The mayor resumed the search, but abandoned it due to a rainstorm and poor directions. Peraza, P√©rez, Jos√© Rivas del Mar, Jos√© Mar√≠a Correa and Jos√© Antonio Martinez were later arrested, but Cofres√≠ remained free. On August 5, 1824, the pirate and a skeleton crew captured the sloop Mar√≠a off the coast of Guayama as she completed a run between Guayanilla and Ponce under the command of Juan Camino. After boarding the ship they decided not to plunder her, since a larger craft was sailing towards them. The pirates fled west, intercepting a second sloop (La Voladora) off Morillos. Cofres√≠ did not plunder her either, instead requesting information from captain Rafael Mola. That month a ship commanded by the pirates stalked the port of Fajardo, taking advantage of the lack of gunboats capable of pursuing their shallow-draft vessels. Shortly afterwards, the United States ordered captain Charles Boarman of the USS Weasel to monitor the western waters of Puerto Rico as part of an international force. The schooner located a sloop commanded by the pirates off Culebra, but it fled to Vieques and ran inland into dense vegetation; Boarman could only recover the ship. The Danish sloop Jordenxiold was intercepted off Isla Palominos on September 3, 1824, as she completed a voyage from Saint Thomas to Fajardo; the pirates stole goods and cash from the passengers. The incident attracted the attention of the Danish government, which commissioned the Santa Cruz (a 16-gun brigantine commanded by Michael Klariman) to monitor the areas off Vieques and Culebra. On September 8‚Äì9 a hurricane, Nuestra Se√±ora de la Monserrate, struck southern Puerto Rico and passed directly over the Mona Passage. Cofres√≠ and his crew were caught in the storm, which drove their ship towards Hispaniola. According to historian Enrique Ram√≠rez Brau, an expedition weeks later by Fajardo commander Ram√≥n Aboy to search Vieques, Culebra and the Windward Islands for pirates was actually after Cofres√≠. The operation used the schooner Aurora (owned by Nicol√°s M√°rquez) and Flor de Mayo, owned by Jos√© Mar√≠a Marujo. After weeks of searching, the team failed to locate anything of interest. Continuing to drift, Cofres√≠ and his crew were captured after his ship reached Santo Domingo. Sentenced to six years in prison, they were sent to a keep named Torre del Homenaje. Cofres√≠ and his men escaped, were recaptured and again imprisoned. The group escaped again, breaking the locks on their cell doors and climbing down the prison walls on a stormy night on a rope made from their clothing. With Cofres√≠ were two other inmates: a man known as Portalat√≠n and Manuel Reyes Paz, former boatswain of El Scipi√≥n. After reaching the province of San Pedro de Macor√≠s, the pirates bought a ship. They sailed from Hispaniola in late September to Naguabo, where Portalat√≠n disembarked. From there they went to the island of Vieques, where they set up another hideout and regrouped. =Challenge to the West Indies Squadron= By October 1824 piracy in the region was dramatically reduced, with Cofres√≠ the remaining target of concern. However, that month Peraza, P√©rez, Hern√°dez, Gallardo, Jos√© Rodr√≠guez and Ramos escaped from jail. Three former members of Lamparo's crew‚Äîa man of African descent named Bibi√°n Hern√°ndez Morales, Antonio del Castillo and Juan Manuel de Fuentes Rodr√≠guez‚Äîalso broke out. They were joined by Juan Manuel \\"Venado\\" de Fuentes Rodr√≠guez, Ignacio Cabrera, Miguel de la Cruz, Damasio Arroyo, Miguel \\"El Rasgado\\" de la Rosa and Juan Reyes. Those traveling east met with Cofres√≠, who welcomed them on his crew; the pirate was in Naguabo looking for recruits after his return from Hispaniola. Hern√°ndez Morales, an experienced knife fighter, was second-in-command of the new crew. At the height of their success, they had a flotilla of three sloops and a schooner. The group avoided capture by hiding in Ceiba, Fajardo, Naguabo, Jobos Bay and Vieques, and when Cofres√≠ sailed the east coast he reportedly flew the flag of Gran Colombia. On October 24, Hern√°ndez Morales led a group of six pirates in the robbery of Cabot, Bailey & Company in Saint Thomas, making off with US$5,000. On October 26 the USS Beagle, commanded by Charles T. Platt, navigated by John Low and carrying shopkeeper George Bedford (with a list of plundered goods, which were reportedly near Naguabo) left Saint Thomas. Platt sailed to Vieques, following a tip about a pirate sloop. Beagle opened fire, interrupting the capture of a sloop from Saint Croix, but the pirates docked at Punta Arenas in Vieques and fled inland; one, identified as Juan Felis, was captured after a shootout. When Platt disembarked in Fajardo to contact Juan Campos, a local associate of Bedford, the authorities accused him of piracy and detained him. The officer was later freed, but the pirates escaped. Commodore Porter's reaction to what was later known as the Fajardo Affair led to a diplomatic crisis which threatened war between Spain and the United States; Campos was later found to be involved in the distribution of loot. With more ships, Cofres√≠'s activity near Culebra and Vieques peaked by November 1824. The international force reacted by sending more warships to patrol the zone; France provided the Gazelle, a brigantine, and the frigate Constancia. After the Fajardo incident the United States increased its flotilla in the region, with the USS Beagle joined by the schooners and in addition to the previously-commissioned Santa Cruz and Scout. Despite unprecedented monitoring, Cofres√≠ grew bolder. John D. Sloat, captain of Grampus, received intelligence placing the pirates in a schooner out of Cabo Rojo. On the evening of January 25, 1825 Cofres√≠ sailed a sloop towards Grampus, which was patrolling the west coast. In position, the pirate commanded his crew (armed with sabers and muskets) to open fire and ordered the schooner to stop. When Sloat gave the order to counterattack, Cofres√≠ sailed into the night. Although a skiff and cutters from Grampus were sent after the pirates, they failed to find them after a two-hour search. The pirates sailed east and docked at Quebrada de las Palmas, a river in Naguabo. From there, Cofres√≠, Hern√°ndez Morales, Juan Francisco \\"Ceniza\\" Pizarro and De los Reyes crossed the mangroves and vegetation to the Quebrada barrio in Fajardo. Joined by a fugitive, Juan Pedro Espinoza, the group robbed the house of Juan Becerril and hid in a house in the nearby R√≠o Abajo barrio. Two days later Cofres√≠ again led his flotilla out to sea and targeted San Vicente, a Spanish sloop making its way back from Saint Thomas. Cofres√≠ attacked with two sloops, ordering his crew to fire muskets and blunderbusses. Sustaining heavy damage, San Vicente finally escaped because she was near port. On February 10, 1825, Cofres√≠ plundered the sloop Neptune. The merchant ship, with a cargo of fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune was owned by Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofres√≠ began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the eight to ten pirates (including Cofres√≠). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofres√≠ sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship. Guayama mayor Francisco Brenes doubled his patrol. Salovi was soon arrested, and informed on his shipmates. Hern√°ndez Morales led another sloop, intercepting Beagle off Vieques. After a battle, the pirate sloop was captured and Hern√°ndez Morales was transported to St. Thomas for trial. After being sentenced to death, he escaped from prison and disappeared for years. According to a St. Thomas resident, on February 12, 1825 the pirates retaliated by setting fire to a town on the island. That week, Neptune captured a Danish schooner belonging to W. Furniss (a company based in Saint Thomas) off the Ponce coast with a load of imported merchandise. After the assault, Cofres√≠ and his crew abandoned the ship at sea. Later seen floating with broken masts, it was presumed lost. Some time later Cofres√≠ and his crew boarded another ship owned by the company near Guayama, again plundering and abandoning her. Like its predecessor, it was seen near Caja de Muertos (Dead Man's Chest) before disappearing. Evading Beagle, Cofres√≠ returned to Jobos Bay; on February 15, 1825, the pirates arrived in Fajardo. Three days later John Low picked up a six-gun sloop, Anne (commonly known by her Spanish name Ana or La Ana), which he had ordered from boat-builder Toribio Centeno and registered in St. Thomas. Centeno sailed the sloop to Fajardo, where he received permission to dock at Quebrada de Palmas in Naguabo. As its new owner Low accompanied him, remaining aboard while cargo was loaded. That night Cofres√≠ led a group of eight pirates, stealthily boarded the ship and forced the crew to jump overboard; during the capture, Cofres√≠ reportedly picked $20 from Low's pocket. Despite having to \\"walk the plank\\", Low's crew survived and reported the assault to the governor of Saint Thomas. Low probably attracted the pirates' attention by docking near one of their hideouts; his work on the Beagle rankled, and they were hungry for revenge after the capture of Hern√°ndez Morales. Low met Centeno at his hacienda, where he told the Spaniard about the incident and later filed a formal complaint in Fajardo. Afterwards, he and his crew sailed to Saint Thomas. Although another account suggests that Cofres√≠ bought Anne from Centeno for twice Low's price, legal documents verify that the builder was paid by Low. Days later, Cofres√≠ led his pirates to the Humacao shipyard and they stole a cannon from a gunboat (ordered by Miguel de la Torre to pursue the pirates) which was under construction. The crew armed themselves with weapons found on the ships they boarded. After the hijacking, Cofres√≠ adopted Anne as his flagship. Although she is popularly believed to have been renamed El Mosquito, all official documents use her formal name. Anne was quickly used to intercept a merchant off the coast of Vieques who was completing a voyage from Saint Croix to Puerto Rico. Like others before it, the fate of the captured ship and its crew is unknown. The Spanish countered with an expedition from the port of Patillas. Captain Sebasti√°n Quevedo commanded a small boat, Esperanza, to find the pirates but was unsuccessful after several days at sea. At the same time, de la Torre pressured the regional military commanders to take action against the pirates and undercover agents monitored maritime traffic in most coastal towns. The pirates docked Anne in Jobos Bay before sunset, a pattern reported by the local militia to southern region commander Tom√°s de Renovales. At this time the pirates sailed Anne towards Pe√±uelas, where the ship was recognized. Cofres√≠'s last capture was on March 5, 1825, when he commanded the hijacking of a boat owned by Vicente Antoneti in Salinas. Capture and trial Early 20th-century illustration of the capture of Cofres√≠'s flagship, the sloop Anne (right) By the spring of 1825, the flotilla led by Anne was the last substantial pirate threat in the Caribbean. The incursion which finally ended Cofres√≠'s operation began serendipitously. When Low arrived at his home base in Saint Thomas with news of Annes hijacking, a Puerto Rican ship reported a recent sighting. Sloat requested three international sloops (with Spanish and Danish papers) from the Danish governor, collaborating with Pastoriza and Pierety. All four of Cofres√≠'s victims left port shortly after the authorization on March 4; the task force was made up of Grampus, San Jos√© y Las Animas, an unidentified vessel belonging to Pierety and a third sloop staffed by volunteers from a Colombian frigate. After sighting Anne while they negotiated the involvement of the Spanish government in Puerto Rico, the task force decided to split up. San Jos√© y Las Animas found Cofres√≠ the next day, and mounted a surprise attack. The sailors aboard hid while Cofres√≠, recognizing the ship as a local merchant vessel, gave the order to attack it. When Anne was within range, the crew of San Jos√© y las Animas opened fire. Startled, the pirates countered with cannon and musket fire while attempting to outrun the sloop. Unable to shake off San Jos√© y las Animas and having lost two members of his crew, Cofres√≠ grounded Anne and fled inland. Although a third pirate fell during the landing, most scattered throughout rural Guayama and adjacent areas. Cofres√≠, injured, was accompanied by two crew members. Half his crew was captured shortly afterwards, but the captain remained at large until the following day. At midnight a local trooper, Juan C√°ndido Garay, and two other members of the Puerto Rican militia spotted Cofres√≠. The trio ambushed the pirate, who was hit by blunderbuss fire while he was fleeing. Despite his injury, Cofres√≠ fought back with a knife until he was subdued by militia machetes. After their capture, the pirates were held at a prison in Guayama before their transfer to San Juan. Cofres√≠ met with mayor Francisco Brenes, offering him 4,000 pieces of eight (which he claimed to possess) in exchange for his freedom. Although a key component of modern myth, this is the only historical reference to Cofres√≠'s hiding any treasure. Brenes declined the bribe. Cofres√≠ and his crew remained in Castillo San Felipe del Morro in San Juan for the rest of their lives. On March 21, 1825, the pirate's reputed servant (known only as Carlos) was arrested in Guayama. =Military prosecution= Cofres√≠ received a council of war trial, with no possibility of a civil trial. The only right granted the pirates was to choose their lawyers; the arguments the attorneys could make were limited, and their role was a formality. Jos√© Madrazo was again the prosecutor. The case was hurried‚Äîan oddity, since other cases as serious (or more so) sometimes took months or years. Cofres√≠ was reportedly tried as an insurgent corsair (and listed as such in a subsequent explanatory action in Spain), in accordance with measures enacted by governor Miguel de la Torre the year before. It is thought that the reason for the irregularities was that the Spanish government was under international scrutiny, with several neutral countries filing complaints about pirate and privateer attacks in Puerto Rican waters; there was additional pressure due to the start of David Porter's court-martial in the United States for invading the municipality of Fajardo. The ministry rushed the Cofres√≠ trial, denying him and his crew defense witnesses or testimony (required by trial protocol). The trial was based on the pirates' confessions, with their legitimacy or circumstances not established. Fort San Felipe del Morro The other pirates on trial were Manuel Aponte Monteverde of A√±asco; Vicente del Valle Carbajal of Punta Espada (or Santo Domingo, depending on the report); Vicente Xim√©nes of Cuman√°; Antonio Delgado of Humacao; Victoriano Salda√±a of Juncos; Agust√≠n de Soto of San Germ√°n; Carlos D√≠az of Trinidad de Barlovento; Carlos Torres of Fajardo; Juan Manuel Fuentes of Havana, and Jos√© Rodr√≠guez of Cura√ßao. Torres stood out as an African and Cofres√≠'s slave. Among the few sentenced for piracy who were not executed, his sentence was to be sold at public auction with his price earmarked for trial costs. Cofres√≠ confessed to capturing a French sloop in Vieques; a Danish schooner; a sailing ship from St. Thomas; a brigatine and a schooner from eastern Hispaniola; a sloop with a load of cattle in Boca del Infierno; a ship from which he stole 800 pieces of eight in Patillas, and an American schooner with a cargo worth 8,000 pieces of eight (abandoned and burned in Punta de Pe√±ones). Under pressure, he was adamant that he was unaware of the current whereabouts of the vessels or their crews and that he had never killed anyone; his testimony was corroborated by the other pirates. However, according to a letter sent to Hezekiah Niles' Weekly Register Cofres√≠ admitted off the record that he had killed nearly 400 people (but no Puerto Ricans). The pirate also confessed that he burned the cargo of an American vessel to throw off the authorities. The defendants' social status and association with criminal (or outlaw) elements dictated the course of events. Captain Jos√© Madrazo served as judge and prosecutor of the one-day trial. Governor Miguel de la Torre may have influenced the process, negotiating with Madrazo beforehand. On July 14, 1825, U.S. Congressman Samuel Smith accused Secretary of State Henry Clay of pressuring the Spanish governor to execute the pirates. Death and legacy On the morning of March 29, 1825, a firing squad was assembled to carry out the sentence handed down to the pirates. The public execution, which had a large number of spectators, was supervised by the Regimiento de Infanter√≠a de Granada between eight and nine a.m. Catholic priests were present to hear confessions and offer comfort. As the pirates prayed, they were shot before the silent crowd. Although San Felipe del Morro is the accepted execution site, Alejandro Tapia y Rivera (whose father was a member of the Regimiento de Granada) places their execution near Convento Dominico in the Baluarte de Santo Domingo (part of present-day Old San Juan). According to historian Enrique Ram√≠rez Brau, in a final act of defiance Cofres√≠ refused to have his eyes covered after he was tied to a chair and he was blindfolded by soldiers. Richard Wheeler said that the pirate said that after killing three or four hundred people, it would be strange if he was not accustomed to death. Cofres√≠ supposedly said he had \\"killed four hundred persons with his own hands but never to his knowledge had he killed a native of Puerto Rico.\\" Cofres√≠'s last words were reportedly, \\"I have killed hundreds with my own hands, and I know how to die. Fire!\\" These earrings, worn by Cofres√≠, are on display at the National Museum of American History. According to several of the pirates' death certificates, they were buried on the shore next to the Santa Mar√≠a Magdalena de Pazzis Cemetery. Hern√°ndez Morales and several of his associates received the same treatment. Cofres√≠ and his men were buried behind the cemetery, on what is now a lush green hill overlooking the cemetery wall. Contrary to local lore, they were not buried in Old San Juan Cemetery (Cementerio Antiguo de San Juan); their execution as criminals made them ineligible for burial in the Catholic cemetery. A letter from Sloat to United States Secretary of the Navy Samuel L. Southard implied that at least some of the pirates were intended to be \\"beheaded and quartered, and their parts sent to all the small ports around the island to be exhibited\\". Spanish authorities continued to arrest Cofres√≠ associates until 1839. At this time defendants were required to pay trial expenses, and Cofres√≠'s family was charged 643 pieces of eight, two reales and 12 maraved√≠. Contemporary documents suggest that Juana Creitoff, with little or no support from Cofres√≠'s brothers and sisters, was left with the debt. His brothers distanced themselves from the trial and their brother's legacy, and Juan Francisco left Cabo Rojo for Humacao. Juan Ignacio also evidently disassociated himself from Creitoff and her daughter, and one of Juan Ignacio's granddaughters ignored Bernardina and her descendants. Due to Cofres√≠'s squandering of his treasure, his only asset the Spanish government could seize was Carlos. Appraised at 200 pesos, he was sold to Juan Saint Just for 133 pesos. After the auction costs were paid, only 108 pesos and 2 reales were left; the remainder was paid by F√©lix and Miguel Mattei after they made a deal with the authorities giving them the cargo of the San Jos√© y las Animas in return for future accountability. Juana Creitoff died a year later. Bernardina later married a Venezuelan immigrant, Estanislao Asencio Vel√°zquez, continuing Cofres√≠'s blood lineage in Cabo Rojo to this day. She had seven children: Jos√© Lucas, Mar√≠a Esterlina, Antonio Salvador, Antonio Luciano, Pablo, Mar√≠a Encarnaci√≥n and Juan Bernardino. One of Cofres√≠'s most notable descendants was Ana Gonz√°lez, better known by her married name Ana G. M√©ndez. Cofres√≠'s great-granddaughter, M√©ndez was directly descended from the Cabo Rojo bloodline through her mother Ana Gonz√°lez Cofres√≠. Known for her interest in education, she was the first member of her branch of the Cofres√≠ family to earn a high-school diploma and university degree. A teacher, M√©ndez founded the Puerto Rico High School of Commerce during the 1940s (when most women did not complete their education). By the turn of the 21st century her initiative had evolved into the Ana G. M√©ndez University System, the largest group of private universities in Puerto Rico. Other branches of the Cofres√≠ family include Juan Francisco's descendants in Ponce, and Juan Ignacio's lineage persists in the western region. Internationally, the Kupferschein family remains in Trieste. Another family member was Severo Colberg Ram√≠rez, speaker of the House of Representatives of Puerto Rico during the 1980s. Colberg made efforts to popularize Cofres√≠, particularly the heroic legends which followed his death. He was related to the pirate through his sister Juana, who married Germ√°n Colberg. After Cofres√≠'s death, items associated with him have been preserved or placed on display. His birth certificate is at San Miguel Arc√°ngel Church with those of other notable figures, including Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances and Salvador Brau. Earrings said to have been worn by Cofres√≠ were owned by Ynocencia Ram√≠rez de Arellano, a maternal cousin. Her great-great-grandson, collector Teodoro Vidal Santoni, gave them to the National Museum of American History in 1997 and the institution displayed them in a section devoted to Spanish colonial history. Locally, documents are preserved in the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture's General Archive of Puerto Rico, the Ateneo Puertorrique√±o, the University of Puerto Rico's General Library and Historic Investigation Department and the Catholic Church's Parochial Archives. Outside Puerto Rico, records can be found at the National Archives Building and the General Archive of the Indies. However, official documents relating to Cofres√≠'s trial and execution have been lost. Modern view Modern portrayal of Cofres√≠, standing on the deck of a ship and preparing for battle Few aspects of Cofres√≠'s life and relationships have avoided the romanticism surrounding pirates in popular culture. During his life, attempts by Spanish authorities to portray him as a menacing figure by emphasizing his role as \\"pirate lord\\" and nicknaming him the \\"terror of the seas\\" planted him in the collective consciousness. This, combined with his boldness, transformed Cofres√≠ into a swashbuckler differing from late-19th-century fictional accounts of pirates. The legends are inconsistent in their depiction of historical facts, often contradicting each other. Cofres√≠'s race, economic background, personality and loyalties are among variable aspects of these stories. However, the widespread use of these myths in the media has resulted in their general acceptance as fact. The myths and legends surrounding Cofres√≠ fall into two categories: those portraying him as a generous thief or anti- hero and those describing him as overwhelmingly evil. A subcategory represents him as an adventurer, world traveler or womanizer. Reports by historians such as Ti√≥ of the pirate sharing his loot with the needy have evolved into a detailed mythology. These apologetics attempt to justify his piracy, blaming it on poverty, revenge or a desire to restore his family's honor, and portray Cofres√≠ as a class hero defying official inequality and corruption. He is said to have been a protector and benefactor of children, women and the elderly, with some accounts describing him as a rebel hero and supporter of independence from imperial power. Legends describing Cofres√≠ as malevolent generally link him to supernatural elements acquired through witchcraft, mysticism or a deal with the Devil. This horror fiction emphasizes his ruthlessness while alive or his unwillingness to remain dead. Cofres√≠'s ghost has a fiery aura or extraordinary powers of manifestation, defending the locations of his hidden treasure or roaming aimlessly. Cofres√≠ has been vilified by merchants. Legends portraying him as benign figure are more prevalent near Cabo Rojo; in other areas of Puerto Rico, they focus on his treasure and depict him as a cutthroat. Most of the hidden-treasure stories have a moral counseling against greed; those trying to find the plunder are killed, dragged to Davy Jones' Locker or attacked by the ghost of Cofres√≠ or a member of his crew. Rumors about the locations of hidden treasure flourish, with dozens of coves, beaches and buildings linked to pirates in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola. The 20th century revived interest in Cofres√≠'s piracy as a tourist attraction, with municipalities in Puerto Rico highlighting their historical connection to the pirates. By the second half of the century, beaches and sports teams (especially in his native Cabo Rojo, which features a monument in his honor) were named for him; in the Dominican Republic, a resort town was named after the pirate. Cofres√≠'s name has been commercialized, with a number of products and businesses adopting it and its associated legends. Puerto Rico's first flag carrier seaplane was named for him. Several attempts have been made to portray Cofres√≠'s life on film, based on legend. Coplas, songs and plays have been adapted from the oral tradition, and formal studies of the historical Cofres√≠ and the legends surrounding him have appeared in book form. Historians Cardona Bonet, Acosta, Salvador Brau, Ram√≥n Ibern Fleytas, Antonio S. Pedreira, Bienvenido Camacho, Isabel Cuch√≠ Coll, Fernando G√©igel Sabat, Ram√≠rez Brau and Cayetano Coll y Toste have published the results of their research. Others inspired by the pirate include poets Ces√°reo Rosa Nieves and the brothers Luis and Gustavo Pal√©s Matos. Educators Juan Bernardo Huyke and Robert Fern√°ndez Valledor have also published on Cofres√≠. In mainstream media Cofres√≠ has recently been discussed in the newspapers El Mundo, El Imparcial, El Nuevo D√≠a, Primera Hora, El Peri√≥dico de Catalunya, Die Tageszeitung, Tribuna do Norte and The New York Times, and the magazines Puerto Rico Ilustrado, Fiat Lux and Proceedings have published articles on the pirate.

Original caption: \\"His laboratory is his ballpoint pen.\\" Julian Seymour Schwinger (; February 12, 1918 ‚Äì July 16, 1994) was a Nobel Prize winning American theoretical physicist. He is best known for his work on quantum electrodynamics (QED), in particular for developing a relativistically invariant perturbation theory, and for renormalizing QED to one loop order. Schwinger was a physics professor at several universities. Schwinger is recognized as one of the greatest physicists of the twentieth century, responsible for much of modern quantum field theory, including a variational approach, and the equations of motion for quantum fields. He developed the first electroweak model, and the first example of confinement in 1+1 dimensions. He is responsible for the theory of multiple neutrinos, Schwinger terms, and the theory of the spin-3/2 field. Biography Julian Seymour Schwinger was born in New York City, to Ashkenazi Jewish parents, Belle (n√©e Rosenfeld) and Benjamin Schwinger, a garment manufacturer, who had emigrated from Poland to the United States. Both his father and his mother's parents were prosperous clothing manufacturers, although the family business declined after the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The family followed the Orthodox Jewish tradition. Schwinger attended the Townsend Harris High School and then the City College of New York as an undergraduate before transferring to Columbia University, where he received his B.A. in 1936 and his PhD (overseen by Isidor Isaac Rabi) in 1939 at the age of 21. He worked at the University of California, Berkeley (under J. Robert Oppenheimer), and was later appointed to a position at Purdue University. =Career= After having worked with Oppenheimer, Schwinger's first regular academic appointment was at Purdue University in 1941. While on leave from Purdue, he worked at the MIT Radiation Laboratory instead of at the Los Alamos National Laboratory during World War II. He provided theoretical support for the development of radar. After the war, Schwinger left Purdue for Harvard University, where he taught from 1945 to 1974. In 1966 he became the Eugene Higgins professor of physics at Harvard. Schwinger developed an affinity for Green's functions from his radar work, and he used these methods to formulate quantum field theory in terms of local Green's functions in a relativistically invariant way. This allowed him to calculate unambiguously the first corrections to the electron magnetic moment in quantum electrodynamics. Earlier non-covariant work had arrived at infinite answers, but the extra symmetry in his methods allowed Schwinger to isolate the correct finite corrections. Schwinger developed renormalization, formulating quantum electrodynamics unambiguously to one-loop order. In the same era, he introduced non-perturbative methods into quantum field theory, by calculating the rate at which electron‚Äìpositron pairs are created by tunneling in an electric field, a process now known as the \\"Schwinger effect.\\" This effect could not be seen in any finite order in perturbation theory. Schwinger's foundational work on quantum field theory constructed the modern framework of field correlation functions and their equations of motion. His approach started with a quantum action and allowed bosons and fermions to be treated equally for the first time, using a differential form of Grassman integration. He gave elegant proofs for the spin-statistics theorem and the CPT theorem, and noted that the field algebra led to anomalous Schwinger terms in various classical identities, because of short distance singularities. These were foundational results in field theory, instrumental for the proper understanding of anomalies. In other notable early work, Rarita and Schwinger formulated the abstract Pauli and Fierz theory of the spin-3/2 field in a concrete form, as a vector of Dirac spinors, Rarita‚ÄìSchwinger equation. In order for the spin-3/2 field to interact consistently, some form of supersymmetry is required, and Schwinger later regretted that he had not followed up on this work far enough to discover supersymmetry. Schwinger discovered that neutrinos come in multiple varieties, one for the electron and one for the muon. Nowadays there are known to be three light neutrinos; the third is the partner of the tau lepton. In the 1960s, Schwinger formulated and analyzed what is now known as the Schwinger model, quantum electrodynamics in one space and one time dimension, the first example of a confining theory. He was also the first to suggest an electroweak gauge theory, an SU(2) gauge group spontaneously broken to electromagnetic U(1) at long distances. This was extended by his student Sheldon Glashow into the accepted pattern of electroweak unification. He attempted to formulate a theory of quantum electrodynamics with point magnetic monopoles, a program which met with limited success because monopoles are strongly interacting when the quantum of charge is small. Having supervised 73 doctoral dissertations, Schwinger is known as one of the most prolific graduate advisors in physics. Four of his students won Nobel prizes: Roy Glauber, Benjamin Roy Mottelson, Sheldon Glashow and Walter Kohn (in chemistry). Schwinger had a mixed relationship with his colleagues, because he always pursued independent research, different from mainstream fashion. In particular, Schwinger developed the source theory,Schwinger, J.S. Particles, Sources, and Fields. Vol. 1 (1970) , Vol. 2 (1973) , Reading, MA: Addison-Wesley a phenomenological theory for the physics of elementary particles, which is a predecessor of the modern effective field theory. It treats quantum fields as long-distance phenomena and uses auxiliary 'sources' that resemble currents in classical field theories. The source theory is a mathematically consistent field theory with clearly derived phenomenological results. The criticisms by his Harvard colleagues led Schwinger to leave the faculty in 1972 for UCLA. It is a story widely told that Steven Weinberg, who inherited Schwinger's paneled office in Lyman Laboratory, there found a pair of old shoes, with the implied message, \\"think you can fill these?\\" At UCLA, and for the rest of his career, Schwinger continued to develop the source theory and its various applications. After 1989 Schwinger took a keen interest in the non-mainstream research of cold fusion. He wrote eight theory papers about it. He resigned from the American Physical Society after their refusal to publish his papers., Also He felt that cold fusion research was being suppressed and academic freedom violated. He wrote, \\"The pressure for conformity is enormous. I have experienced it in editors' rejection of submitted papers, based on venomous criticism of anonymous referees. The replacement of impartial reviewing by censorship will be the death of science.\\" In his last publications, Schwinger proposed a theory of sonoluminescence as a long-distance quantum radiative phenomenon associated not with atoms, but with fast-moving surfaces in the collapsing bubble, where there are discontinuities in the dielectric constant. The mechanism of sonoluminescence now supported by experiments focuses on superheated gas inside the bubble as the source of the light. Schwinger was jointly awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1965 for his work on quantum electrodynamics (QED), along with Richard Feynman and Shin'ichir≈ç Tomonaga. Schwinger's awards and honors were numerous even before his Nobel win. They include the first Albert Einstein Award (1951), the U.S. National Medal of Science (1964), honorary D.Sc. degrees from Purdue University (1961) and Harvard University (1962), and the Nature of Light Award of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences (1949). In 1987, Schwinger received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. =Schwinger and Feynman= As a famous physicist, Schwinger was often compared to another legendary physicist of his generation, Richard Feynman. Schwinger was more formally inclined and favored symbolic manipulations in quantum field theory. He worked with local field operators, and found relations between them, and he felt that physicists should understand the algebra of local fields, no matter how paradoxical it was. By contrast, Feynman was more intuitive, believing that the physics could be extracted entirely from the Feynman diagrams, which gave a particle picture. Schwinger commented on Feynman diagrams in the following way, Schwinger disliked Feynman diagrams because he felt that they made the student focus on the particles and forget about local fields, which in his view inhibited understanding. He went so far as to ban them altogether from his class, although he understood them perfectly well. The true difference is however deeper, and it was expressed by Schwinger in the following passage, Despite sharing the Nobel Prize, Schwinger and Feynman had a different approach to quantum electrodynamics and to quantum field theory in general. Feynman used a regulator, while Schwinger was able to formally renormalize to one loop without an explicit regulator. Schwinger believed in the formalism of local fields, while Feynman had faith in the particle paths. They followed each other's work closely, and each respected the other. On Feynman's death, Schwinger described him as =Death= The headstone of Julian Schwinger at Mt. Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, MA. Schwinger died of pancreatic cancer. He is buried at Mount Auburn Cemetery; \\\\frac{\\\\alpha}{2\\\\pi}, where \\\\alpha is the fine structure constant, is engraved above his name on his tombstone. These symbols refer to his calculation of the correction (\\"anomalous\\") to the magnetic moment of the electron.

In philately, a mixed franking is an occurrence of postage stamps of more than one country or issuing entity on a single cover ‚Äî or the occurrence of postage stamps of more than one currency of a country or issuing identity on a single cover. Since nearly all countries of the world have agreed to deliver each other's mail, it is unusual to need more than the stamps of the originating country; valid mixed frankings are uncommon and valued by collectors. Before the advent of the Universal Postal Union in 1874, sending international mail was quite an adventure; it might be necessary to affix the stamps of the destination country in addition to those of the origin, and in the worst cases, possibly for several other countries along the way. Sometimes the letter was held until the recipient brought stamps, they were affixed and cancelled, and the result handed to the recipient. Since this only happened during the first few decades of stamp usage, and only for the few letters that were sent great distances, very few covers have survived. For some combinations, only single examples have survived, and command spectacular prices among collectors. Another form of mixed franking occurs in transitional periods, either as a way to help the public use up the stamps of a defunct government, or involuntarily as a propaganda tool. An example of involuntary mixed franking is when Germany took over Austria in the Anschluss in 1938; during the several months while Austrian stamps were still accepted, Austrians sending mail to Germany were required to include a German stamp on the envelope. Sometimes illegitimate mixed frankings occur when a postal user adds another country's stamps to an envelope just for fun. Many countries' postal regulation require clerks to refuse to handle these, even if the correct postage of the country is present, because they slow down the sorting process, but such covers can still get through the system.

During an 18-year career in Major League Baseball (MLB) (‚Äì), he played as an outfielder, catcher, and first baseman for the Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies, and Colorado Rockies; Murphy is best noted for his many years with the Braves. His entire MLB career was spent in the National League (NL), during which time he won consecutive Most Valuable Player (MVP) awards (‚Äì), the Silver Slugger Award for four straight years (1982‚Äì), and the Gold Glove Award for five straight years (1982‚Äì). Murphy is a member of the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame, Georgia Sports Hall of Fame, and World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame. Early life Dale Murphy was born in Portland, Oregon, on March 12, 1956 to parents Charles and Betty. He had a sister, Sue. Murphy played American Legion Baseball and attended Woodrow Wilson High School. Baseball =Playing career= In 1976, Murphy began his major league career with a nineteen-game stint catching with the Atlanta Braves. He appeared in only eighteen games the following season. In 1978, Murphy played first base mostly; at the plate he had a .226 batting average, though he also showed hints of his future power by hitting 23 home runs. Murphy switched to the outfield in 1980, a move that would help initiate a decade of highly productive play in the National League. Beginning in left field, he soon switched to center field, the position at which he would find his greatest success. By 1982, the most decorated year of Murphy's career, the former catcher had transformed himself into an All-Star MVP outfielder who appeared in each of Atlanta's 162 games. His turnaround as a fielder was equally stark. In 1978, Murphy led all National League first basemen in errors. In 1982, spending time at each of the three outfield positions, he won his first of five consecutive Gold Gloves, as well as the first MVP award by a Brave since Hank Aaron, in 1957 with what were then the Milwaukee Braves. Playing in the decade before the Braves began their dominance of the National League East, Murphy also made his only postseason appearance in 1982. Although he performed well, the eventual World Series-champion St. Louis Cardinals eliminated the Braves in the 1982 National League Championship Series. The league's most valuable player failed to translate his regular season preeminence into October success, hitting safely only three times and scoring one run. Murphy rebounded from the postseason sweep with another MVP award in 1983. This time period ultimately proved the high-water era of Murphy's career. Each year during the four season span from 1982 to 1986 he won a Gold Glove, appeared in the All-Star Game, and placed in the top ten in MVP voting. Murphy circa 1984 In 1988, however, despite being voted to what would be his final All-Star appearance, Murphy's production began an inexorable slide downward. Murphy saw his batting average free-fall from .295 in 1987 to .226 in 1988. Only once more, in 1991, would Murphy bat above .250. Once a consistent source of power at the plate, he never again hit 25 home runs or more in a season. During his 15th season with the Braves, Murphy was traded to the Philadelphia Phillies on August 3, 1990. Murphy's time with the Phillies was mostly uneventful. A degenerative, arthritic condition in his left knee limited Murphy to only 18 games in the 1992 season with the Phillies, although he did hit two home runs in that time to bring his career total to 398. He was released by the Phillies at the end of 1993 Spring Training and, on the same day, signed a Minor League contract with the Colorado Rockies for their inaugural season. He was used mostly as a pinch hitter. After going 0-for-3 with a strikeout in the Rockies' 8-0 road loss to the Los Angeles Dodgers on May 21, 1993 (a rare start and, even more rare, only the fourth time all season he was in a game from the first pitch to the final out), Murphy did not play in the next 4 games. On the morning of May 27, 1993, while the Rockies were in Houston to begin a series with the Astros, he suddenly announced his retirement from baseball at age 37. He explained the Rockies were needing to make a 25-man roster move and informed him ahead of time he was going to be released. The team gave him the chance to retire instead of being released, which he did. He cited \\"many reasons\\" for retiring instead of trying to catch on with another team, but ultimately knew his performance had degraded due to injuries. Murphy finished at 398 career home runs, failing to homer for the Rockies in 49 plate appearances and reach the 400-homer milestone. At the time of his retirement, he was 27th on the all-time home run list and 4th among active players, two behind Andre Dawson of the Boston Red Sox. =Career summary and honors= Murphy finished his career with 398 home runs, 1,266 RBI, and a .265 lifetime batting average. His MVP awards in 1982 and 1983 make him one of only four outfielders in MLB history with consecutive MVP years; at the time, he was the youngest to have accomplished the feat. His many honors include seven All-Star appearances, five Gold Gloves, and four Silver Sluggers. Murphy led the National League in home runs and runs batted in (RBI) twice; he also led the major leagues in home runs and RBI over the 10-year span from 1981 to 1990. One of the most productive and decorated players of the 1980s, Murphy led the National League in games, at bats, runs, hits, extra base hits, RBIs, runs created, total bases, and plate appearances during the decade. He also accomplished a 30‚Äì30 (30 home runs with 30 stolen bases) season in 1983. Murphy played in 740 consecutive games, at the time the 11th longest such streak in baseball history. His jersey number (\\"3\\") was retired by the Atlanta Braves on June 13, 1994, in his honor as opposed to that of even Babe Ruth, who wore Boston Braves number 3 during the partial season with which his career concluded. Murphy was inducted into both the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame and the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 1997.http://oregonsportshall.org/?page_id=56http://georgiasportshalloffame.com/site/our- inductees/ =Public persona= Murphy's clean-living habits off the diamond were frequently noted in the media. A devout member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Murphy did not drink alcoholic beverages, would not allow women to be photographed embracing him, and paid his teammates' dinner checks as long as alcoholic beverages were not on the tab. He also refused to give television interviews unless he was fully dressed. Murphy had been introduced to the LDS Church early in his career by teammate Barry Bonnell. For several years the Atlanta Constitution ran a weekly column, wherein Murphy responded to young fans' questions and letters. In 1987 he shared Sports Illustrated magazine's \\"Sportsmen and Sportswomen of the Year\\" award with seven others, characterized as \\"Athletes Who Care\\", for his work with numerous charities, including the Make-a-Wish Foundation, the Georgia March of Dimes and the American Heart Association. One of his more memorable incidents was reminiscent of a scene from the classic black-and-white baseball film The Pride of the Yankees: > Before a home game against San Francisco on June 12, 1983, Murphy visited in > the stands with Elizabeth Smith, a six-year-old girl who had lost both hands > and a leg when she stepped on a live power line. After Murphy gave her a cap > and a T shirt, her nurse innocently asked if he could hit a home run for > Elizabeth. \\"I didn't know what to say, so I just sort of mumbled 'Well, > O.K.,' \\" says Murphy. That day he hit two homers and drove in all the > Braves' runs in a 3‚Äì2 victory. He was ultimately granted several honors because of his integrity, character, and sportsmanship, including the Lou Gehrig Memorial Award (1985), \\"Sportsman of the Year\\" (1987), Roberto Clemente Award (1988), Bart Giamatti Community Service Award (1991), and World Sports Humanitarian Hall of Fame (1991 induction). =Hall of Fame candidacy= Despite his reputation as a star five-tool player superstar and multiple MVP awards, Murphy did not get elected to the Hall of Fame. He first appeared on the writers' ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1999, the earliest possible year of consideration. He has failed to gain election, joining Barry Bonds, late New York Yankees outfielder Roger Maris and recently eligibile Juan Gonz√°lez as the only Hall of Fame- eligible recipients of multiple MVP awards not in the Hall. His failed candidacy has drawn particular notice due to his reputation as a clean-living player whose career was immediately followed by baseball's scandal-plagued \\"steroids era\\". Baseball writer Rob Neyer feels that the former MVP's candidacy has been hurt by a career that \\"got a late start and suffered an early end.\\" Stuart Miller, baseball writer for The New York Times, also notes the \\"sharp decline\\" in production that plagued Murphy after the age of 31 in arguing, \\"Players who were great for a short time do not receive much [Hall of Fame] recognition.\\" Finding \\"one of baseball's best players in the 1980s\\" to be \\"undervalued\\", Miller nonetheless writes that the Brave great \\"is typically considered a 'close but no' guy.\\" Bill James, father of sabermetrics, says of Murphy, \\"It certainly wouldn't offend me to have him in the Hall of Fame. I just wouldn't advocate it.\\" James's \\"current metric for Hall induction was 300 Win Shares (a complex mathematical equation weighing what players contribute to their team's victories)....\\" Murphy stands at 253 Win Shares. James ranks eight Hall of Famers below Murphy. However, others contend, \\"Murphy's incredible nine-year run in Atlanta was every bit as good as anyone else during his era,\\" with many pointing out the fact that he was a rare bright spot of many miserable Braves teams in the 1980s. Neyer notes that the explosion of power during the steroids-fueled era that began after Murphy's retirement may have caused Murphy's numbers to pale in comparison for many voters. Some have argued that Murphy's reputation for clean living may encourage voters to \\"look more favorably on what Murphy did without using performance-enhancing drugs.\\" (Murphy weighed in on the steroids issue in asserting that career home run leader Barry Bonds \\"without a doubt\\" used performance-enhancing drugs. ) Sports Illustrated's Joe Posnanski has endorsed Murphy as an \\"emotional pick . . . a larger-than-life character who signed every autograph, spoke up for every charity and played brilliant baseball every day for mostly doomed teams.\\" The Baseball Project, a supergroup composed of Peter Buck, Mike Mills, Scott McCaughey, Steve Wynn and Linda Pitmon, wrote the song ‚ÄúTo The Veterans Committee‚Äù advocating his election and praising him for meeting the voting criteria: ability, integrity, sportsmanship, character, and contributions to the team(s) on which the player played. Nonetheless, though he continued to earn the requisite 5% to remain on the ballot, Murphy averaged only 13.6% over the first twelve years of voting. (Election to the hall requires 75%.) In the first decade of his eligibility, he \\"peaked at 23% in 2000 and fell to 11.5% in 2009.\\" Moreover, as writers may only vote for ten players each year, some have argued that the candidacy of stars from the 1980s‚Äîsuch as Murphy, pitcher Jack Morris, and outfielder Tim Raines‚Äîwill become imperiled as a wave of more recently retired players with more statistically impressive credentials becomes eligible in the 2010s. Noting his low vote totals, Murphy has said, \\"Since I'm not that close [to election] ... I don't think about it that much.\\" On January 9, 2013, his 15th and final appearance on the Hall of Fame ballot, Murphy secured 18.9% of the vote, falling well short of the 75% necessary to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame on the BBWAA ballot. Since Murphy's removal from the BBWAA ballot, his Hall of Fame candidacy has been considered twice by the Modern Era Baseball Committee, in 2018 and 2020. Post-baseball life From 1997 to 2000, Murphy served as president of the Massachusetts Boston Mission of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. In 2005, Murphy started a non-profit organization called the iWontCheat Foundation to promote ethical behavior, and deter steroid use and cheating in youth athletics. Since 2008 all players from the participating teams at the Little League World Series wear the \\"I WON'T CHEAT!\\" embroidered patch above the Little League Baseball logo on the left sleeve of their jerseys. In 2008, he was appointed to the National Advisory Board for the national children's charity, Operation Kids. Murphy serves as a national advisor to ASCEND: A Humanitarian Alliance. Murphy is a long time supporter of Operation Smile and also currently serves on the organization's Board of Governors. During the 2012 MLB season, Murphy was a part of the Atlanta Braves TV broadcasting crew and participated in the telecast of at least 14 games. He was the first-base coach for the USA team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic. In 2017 he opened a restaurant, Murph's, in Atlanta near Truist Park, where the Braves have played since the 2017 season. He lives in Alpine, Utah. Author Murphy has written three books. The first, The Scouting Report on Professional Athletics, elaborates details of the professional athlete's lifestyle. Murphy discusses balancing career and family, working with agents, managing business affairs, serving one's community, and preparing for retirement. In his second book, an autobiography titled Murph, he talked about his religious faith. He discussed the struggles of his early baseball career and how he overcame problems. In 2007 Murphy wrote his third book, The Scouting Report for Youth Athletics, in response to what he saw as the increase in negative behavior in youth sports resulting from poor examples set by professional athletes. Included with each book is a 50-page insert which includes contributions from, among others, Peyton Manning, Dwyane Wade, Tom Glavine, and Danica Patrick. In a question-and- answer format, they discuss the lessons they learned from youth sports and how they apply the lessons today. There is also a physician-penned section about illegal performance-enhancing drug use in sports. Personal life Murphy and his wife, Nancy, have eight children: sons Chad, Travis, Shawn, Tyson, Taylor, Jake, and McKay and daughter Madison.

Rotary International is an international service organization whose stated purpose is to bring together business and professional leaders in order to provide humanitarian service and to advance goodwill and peace around the world. It is a non-political and non- religious organization open to all. There are over 35,000 member clubs worldwide, with a membership of 1.2 million individuals, known as Rotarians.  History  Rotary monument in Feira de Santana, Brazil. = The first years of the Rotary Club = The first Rotary Club was formed when attorney Paul P. Harris called together a meeting of three business acquaintances in downtown Chicago, United States, at Harris's friend Gustave Loehr's office in the Unity Building on Dearborn Street on February 23, 1905. and In addition to Harris and Loehr (a mining engineer and freemason\\"Gus Loehr\\", Rotary International.), Silvester Schiele (a coal merchant), and Hiram E. Shorey (a tailor) were the other two who attended this first meeting. The members chose the name Rotary because initially they rotated subsequent weekly club meetings to each other's offices, although within a year, the Chicago club became so large it became necessary to adopt the now-common practice of a regular meeting place. The next four Rotary Clubs were organized in cities in the western United States, beginning with San Francisco, then Oakland, Seattle, and Los Angeles. The National Association of Rotary Clubs in America was formed in 1910. On November 3, 1910, a Rotary club began meeting in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, the beginning of the organisation's internationality. On 22 February 1911, the first meeting of the Rotary Club Dublin was held in Dublin, Ireland. This was the first club established outside of North America. In April 1912, Rotary chartered the Winnipeg club marking the first establishment of an American- style service club outside the United States. To reflect the addition of a club outside of the United States, the name was changed to the International Association of Rotary Clubs in 1912. In August 1912, the Rotary Club of London received its charter from the Association, marking the first acknowledged Rotary club outside North America. It later became known that the Dublin club in Ireland was organized before the London club, but the Dublin club did not receive its charter until after the London club was chartered. During World War I, Rotary in Britain increased from 9 to 22 clubs, and other early clubs in other nations included those in Cuba in 1916, Philippines in 1919 and India in 1920. In 1922, the name was changed to Rotary International. From 1923 to 1928, Rotary's office and headquarters were located on E 20th Street (now E Cullerton Street) in the Atwell Building (designed by famed Chicago architect, Alfred S. Alschuler). During this same time, the monthly magazine The Rotarian was published mere floors below by Atwell Printing and Binding Company. By 1925, Rotary had grown to 200 clubs with more than 20,000 members. During the 1930s there was an expanding conflict in Asia between Japan and China and the fear of a confrontation between Japan and the United States. In hopes of helping resolve these issues, a leading Japanese international statesman Prince Iyesato Tokugawa was chosen as the Honorary Keynote Speaker at Rotary's Silver (25th) Anniversary Convention/Celebration held in 1930 in Chicago. Prince Tokugawa held the influential position of president of Japan's upper house of congress the Diet for 30 years. Tokugawa promoted democratic principles and international goodwill. It was only after his passing in 1940 that Japanese militants were able to push Japan into joining the Axis Powers in WWII. =World War II era in Europe= Rotary Clubs in Spain ceased to operate shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish Civil War. Clubs were disbanded across Europe as follows: * Netherlands (1923) * Finland (1926) * Austria (1938) * Italy (1939) * Czechoslovakia (1940) * Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Yugoslavia and Luxembourg (1941) * Hungary (1941/1942) Rotary International has worked with the UN since the UN started in 1945. At that time Rotary was involved in 65 countries. The two organizations shared ideals around promoting peace. Rotary received consultative status at the UN in 1946‚Äì47. During the Third Reich, Rotary Clubs were grouped with Freemasonry as secret societies associated with Jews and banned Nazi officials from joining them. This was reversed in July 1933 after appeals but the club was forced to ban all Jews from membership. This led to several non-Jews quitting in solidarity. In order to survive the members tried to show their loyalty to the Nazi leadership, inviting government officials and high standing businesspeople like Hermann Schlosser who was a business manager for Degesch which supplied Zyklon B for use at Auschwitz-Birkenau. After 1945, the Rotary club tried to control the damage by preventing members such as Hans Globke and Wolfgang A. Wick from being appointed presidents. =From 1945 onward= U.S. stamp commemorating Rotary International's 50th anniversary in 1955 Rotary clubs in Eastern Europe and other communist-regime nations were disbanded by 1945‚Äì46, but new Rotary clubs were organized in many other countries, and by the time of the national independence movements in Africa and Asia, the new nations already had Rotary clubs. After the relaxation of government control of community groups in Russia and former Soviet satellite nations, Rotarians were welcomed as club organizers, and clubs were formed in those countries, beginning with the Moscow club in 1990. In 1985, Rotary launched its PolioPlus program to immunize all of the world's children against polio. As of 2011, Rotary had contributed more than 900 million US dollars to the cause, resulting in the immunization of nearly two billion children worldwide. , Rotary had more than 1.2 million members in over 32,000 clubs among 200 countries and geographical areas, making it the most widespread by branches and second largest service club by membership, behind Lions Clubs International. The number of Rotarians has slightly declined in recent years: Between 2002 and 2006, they went from 1,245,000 to 1,223,000 members. North America accounts for 450,000 members, Asia for 300,000, Europe for 250,000, Latin America for 100,000, Oceania for 100,000 and Africa for 30,000. =Rotary International Presidents 2001‚Äìpresent= * Richard D.

Rotarians are members of their clubs. The clubs are chartered by the global organization Rotary International (RI) headquartered in Evanston, Illinois. For administrative purposes, the more than 32,000 clubs worldwide are grouped into 529 districts, and the districts into 34 zones. = Rotary Clubs = Durham, England. The Rotary Club is the basic unit of Rotary activity, and each club determines its own membership. Clubs originally were limited to a single club per city, municipality, or town, but Rotary International has encouraged the formation of one or more additional clubs in the largest cities when practical. Most clubs meet weekly, usually at a mealtime on a weekday in a regular location, when Rotarians can discuss club business and hear from guest speakers. Each club also conducts various service projects within its local community, and participates in special projects involving other clubs in the local district, and occasionally a special project in a \\"sister club\\" in another nation. Most clubs also hold social events at least quarterly and in some cases more often. Each club elects its own president and officers among its active members for a one-year term. The clubs enjoy considerable autonomy within the framework of the standard constitution and the constitution and bylaws of Rotary International. The governing body of the club is the Club Board (sometimes called Club Council), consisting of the club president (who serves as the Board chairman), a president-elect, club secretary, club treasurer, and several Club Board directors, including the immediate past president and the President Elect. The president usually appoints the directors to serve as chairs of the major club committees, including those responsible for club service, vocational service, community service, youth service, and international service. Rotarians may attend any Rotary club around the world at one of their weekly meetings. = Rotaract Clubs = Rotaract: It is an organization of young adults (university age and young professionals) who take action through community and international service, learn leadership skills, and participate in professional development. Rotaract clubs are either community or university based. \\"Rotaract\\" stands for \\"Rotary in Action\\", and its motto is \\"Service Above Self\\". Rotaract began as a program of Rotary International, and its first club was founded in 1968 by Charlotte North Rotary Club, located in Charlotte, North Carolina. In 2019, Rotaract went from being a program of Rotary International to being a membership type of Rotary International, elevating its status to resemble that of Rotary clubs. As of 1 July 2020, Rotaract clubs can exist on their own, or may be sponsored by Rotary and/or Rotaract clubs. This makes them true \\"partners in service\\" and key members of the family of Rotary. A Rotaract club may, but is not required to, establish upper age limits, provided that the club (in accordance with its bylaws) obtain the concurrence of its members and the sponsor club(s) (if sponsored). = District level = Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones. The zone director is nominated by the clubs in the zone and elected by the convention for the terms of two consecutive years. A district governor, who is an officer of Rotary International and represents the RI board of directors in the field, leads his/her respective Rotary district. Each governor is nominated by the clubs of his/her district, and elected by all the clubs meeting in the annual RI District Convention held each year. The district governor appoints assistant governors from among the Rotarians of the district to assist in the management of Rotary activity and multi-club projects in the district. = Zone level = Approximately 15 Rotary districts form a zone. A zone director, who serves as a member of the RI board of directors, heads two zones. The zone director is nominated by the clubs in the zone and elected by the convention for the terms of two consecutive years. = Rotary International = Rotary International Headquarters in Evanston, Illinois, United States. Rotary International is governed by a board of directors composed of the international president, the president-elect, the general secretary, and 17 zone directors. The nomination and the election of each president is handled in the one- to three-year period before he or she takes office, and is based on requirements including geographical balance among Rotary zones and previous service as a district governor and board member. The international board meets quarterly to establish policies and make recommendations to the overall governing bodies, the RI Convention and the RI Council on Legislation. ;General Secretary/ CEO Rotary International has a general secretary, who also acts as chief operating officer and leads the Rotary Foundation. The current holder of the post is John Hewko. Membership According to its constitutions (\\"Charters\\"), Rotary defines itself as a non-partisan, non-sectarian organization. It is open to business and professional leaders aged 18 and upwards, with no regard to economic status. One can contact a Rotary club to inquire about membership and it was a traditional method that a person can join a Rotary club only if invited; there is the ability to join without an invitation but it is recommended to attend a meeting to ensure a suitable fit to the club. Some clubs, though not all, have exclusivist membership criteria: reputation and business or professional leadership may be a specific evaluation criterion for issuing invitations to join, and representation from a specific profession or business may be limited to a percentage of a specific club's membership. = Active membership = Active membership is by invitation from a current Rotarian, to professionals or businesspersons working in diverse areas of endeavour. Each club may limit up to ten percent of its membership representing each business or profession in the area it serves. The goal of the clubs is to promote service to the community they work in, as well as to the wider world. Many projects are organised for the local community by a single club, but some are organised globally. = Honorary membership = A sign showing where the local Rotary Club meets, San Marcos, Texas, United States Honorary membership is given by election of a Rotary Club to people who have distinguished themselves by meritorious service in the furtherance of Rotary ideals. Honorary membership is conferred only in exceptional cases. Honorary members are exempt from the payment of admission fees and dues. They have no voting privileges and are not eligible to hold any office in their club. Honorary membership is time limited and terminates automatically at the end of the term, usually one year. It may be extended for an additional period or may also be revoked at any time. Examples of honorary members are heads of state or former heads of state, scientists, members of the military, and other famous figures. = Female membership = From 1905 until the 1980s, women were not allowed membership in Rotary clubs, although Rotarian spouses, including Paul Harris's wife Jean, were often members of the similar \\"Inner Wheel\\" club. Women did play some roles, and Jean Thomson Harris made numerous speeches. Dale Carnegie's biographer Carlos Roberto Bacila describes that in 1955 when women were not permitted to attend Rotary meetings, the Brooklyn Rotary Club made an exception and finally allowed Marilyn Burke, Carnegie's secretary, to accompany him in a lecture inside the Rotary. In 1963, it was noted that the Rotary practice of involving wives in club activities had helped to break down female seclusion in some countries.Bird, John. \\"The Wonderful, Wide, Backslapping World Of Rotary.\\" Saturday Evening Post, 2/9/1963, Vol. 236, Issue 5 Clubs such as Rotary were predated by women's service organisations, which started in the United States as early as 1790. The first Irish clubs discussed admitting women as members in 1912, but the proposal foundered over issues of social class. Gender equity in Rotary moved beyond the theoretical question when in 1976, the Rotary Club of Duarte, California, admitted three women as members. After the club refused to remove the women from membership, Rotary International revoked the club's charter in 1978. The Duarte club filed suit in the California courts, claiming that Rotary Clubs are business establishments subject to regulation under California's Unruh Civil Rights Act, which bans discrimination based on race, gender, religion or ethnic origin. Rotary International then appealed the decision to the U.S. Supreme Court. The RI attorney argued that \\"... [the decision] threatens to force us to take in everyone, like a motel\\". The Duarte Club was not alone in opposing RI leadership; the Seattle-International District club unanimously voted to admit women in 1986. The United States Supreme Court, on 4 May 1987, confirmed the Californian decision supporting women, in the case Board of Directors, Rotary International v. Rotary Club of Duarte. Rotary International then removed the gender requirements from its requirements for club charters, and most clubs in most countries have opted to include women as members of Rotary Clubs. The first female club president to be elected was Sylvia Whitlock of the Rotary Club of Duarte, California in 1987. By 2007, there was a female trustee of Rotary's charitable wing The Rotary Foundation while female district governors and club presidents were common. Women Rotarians in 1950s costume at the Rotary Club of Sonoma Valley's annual fundraiser in 2015 Women currently account for 22% of international Rotary membership.Rotary International Online Member Data 12 June 2017 In 2013, Anne L. Matthews, a Rotarian from South Carolina, began her term as the first female vice- president of Rotary International. Also in 2013, Nan McCreadie was appointed as the first female president of Rotary International in Great Britain and Ireland (RIBI).Lake, Howard. \\"Nan McCreadie to become Rotary's first female president.\\" UK Fundraising. 25 June 2013. http://www.fundraising.co.uk/news/2013/06/25/nan-mccreadie-become- rotary039s-first-female-president#sthash.KfC2sc6p.dpuf The first woman to join Rotary in Ghana, West Africa was Hilda Danquah (Rotary Club of Cape Coast) in 1992. The first woman president in Ghana was Dr. Naana Agyeman-Mensah in 2001 (Rotary Club of Accra-Airport). Up until 2013, there has been 46 women presidents in the 30 Rotary clubs in Ghana. In 2013, Stella Dongo from Zimbabwe was appointed District Governor for District 9210 (Zimbabwe/Zambia/Malawi/Northern-Mozambique) for the Rotary year 2013‚Äì14 making her the first female District Governor in the region. She had previously held the offices of Assistant Governor (2006‚Äì08), District Administrator (2008‚Äì09) and President of The Rotary Club of Highlands (2005‚Äì06). She was also Zimbabwe's Country Coordinator (2009‚Äì10). Stella, who is a Master PRLS 5 Graduate has been recognised and awarded various District awards including Most Able President for year 2005‚Äì06 and Assistant Governor of the year 2006‚Äì07 and a Paul Harris Fellow. The change of the second Rotarian motto in 2004, from \\"He profits most who serves best\\" to \\"They profit most who serve best\\", 99 years after its foundation, illustrates the move to general acceptance of women members in Rotary. = Racial and sexual orientation diversity = The first Rotary Clubs in Asia were in Manila in the Philippines and Shanghai in China, each in July 1919. Rotary's office in Illinois immediately began encouraging the Rotary Club of Shanghai to recruit Chinese members \\"believing that when a considerable number of the native business and professional men have been so honoured, the Shanghai Club will begin to realize its period of greatest success.\\" As part of considering the application of a Club to be chartered in Kolkata (then Calcutta), India in January 1920 and Tokyo, Japan in October 1920, Rotary formally considered the issue of racial restriction in membership and determined that the organization could not allow racial restrictions to the organization's growth. In Rotary's legislative deliberations in June 1921, it was formally determined that racial restrictions would not be permitted. Non-racialism was included in the terms of the standard constitution in 1922 and required to be adopted by all member Clubs. Rotary and other service clubs in the last decade of the 20th century became open to gay members.Quittner, Jeremy. \\"Join the Club.\\" Advocate, 4/16/2002, Issue 861 Affiliates Rotary Clubs sponsor a number of affiliated clubs that promote the goals of Rotary in their community. = Inner Wheel Clubs = Inner Wheel is an international organization founded in 1924 to unite wives and daughters of Rotarians. Inner Wheel Clubs exist in over 103 countries. Like Rotary, Inner Wheel is divided into local clubs and districts. Female spouses of Rotary members are traditionally called \\"Rotary Annes\\".  Programs and Activities of Rotary International  Rotary International monument in Tigre, Argentina. Rotary concentrates on seven areas: promoting peace, improving health through disease prevention and treatment, improving the health of mothers and children, water and sanitation, education, economic development, and supporting the environment. = PolioPlus = The most notable current global project, PolioPlus, is contributing to the global eradication of polio. Sergio Mulitsch di Palmenberg (1923‚Äì1987), Governor of RI District 204 (1984‚Äì1985), founder of the RC of Treviglio and Pianura Bergamasca (Italy), was the man who inspired and promoted the RI PolioPlus vaccination campaign.Forward, David C. A Century of Service: The Story of Rotary International. Published by Rotary International. Evanston, IL: 2009. First edition 2003. . Mulitsch made it possible shipping the first 500,000 doses of antipolio vaccine to the Philippines at the beginning of 1980.Franco Pellaschiar, \\"Corrispondenza, atti, attestati e stralci di documenti sull'impegno di Sergio Mulitsch per l'Operazione PolioPlus\\". In Realt√† Nuova, anno LXVII, n. 3, Milano, 2003. This project later gave rise to the NGO \\"Nuovi Spazi al Servire\\" co-ordinated by Luciano Ravaglia (RC Forl√¨, Italy).Luciano Ravaglia, \\"L'eredit√† di Sergio Mulitsh: \\"Nuovi spazi al servire\\", l'Istituto Ong fra rotariani italiani\\". In Realt√† Nuova, anno LXVII, n. 3, Milano, 2003. Since beginning the project in 1985, Rotarians have contributed over US$850 million and hundreds of thousands of volunteer-hours, leading to the inoculation of more than two billion of the world's children. Inspired by Rotary's commitment, the World Health Organization (WHO) passed a resolution in 1988 to eradicate polio by 2000. Now a partner in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) with WHO, UNICEF and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Rotary is recognized by the United Nations as the key private partner in the eradication effort. Elito \\"AmangPintor\\" Circa In 2008, Rotary received a $100 million challenge grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Rotary committed to raising $100 million. In January 2009, Bill Gates announced a second challenge grant of $255 million. Rotary again committed to raising another $100 million. In total, Rotary will raise $200 million by 30 June 2012. Together, the Gates Foundation and Rotary have committed $555 million toward the eradication of polio. At the time of the second challenge grant, Bill Gates said: There has been some limited criticism concerning the program for polio eradication. There are some reservations regarding the adaptation capabilities of the virus in some of the oral vaccines, which have been reported to cause infection in populations with low vaccination coverage. As stated by Vaccine Alliance, however, in spite of the limited risk of polio vaccination, it would neither be prudent nor practicable to cease the vaccination program until there is strong evidence that \\"all wild poliovirus transmission [has been] stopped\\". In a 2006 speech at the Rotary International Convention, held at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Bruce Cohick stated that polio in all its known wild forms would be eliminated by late 2008, provided efforts in Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India all proceed with their current momentum. As of October 2012, Nigeria, Afghanistan, and Pakistan still had wild polio, but it had been eliminated in India. In 2014, polio survivor and Rotarian Ramesh Ferris met with the Dalai Lama to discuss the Global Polio Eradication Initiative. The meeting went viral via a selfie taken by Ferris with the Dalai Lama.Kotecha, Nisha. \\"Best Selfie Ever.\\" Good News Shared. http://goodnewsshared.com/best-selfie-ever = Interact = Interact is Rotary International's service club for young people ages 12 to 18. Interact clubs are sponsored by Rotary clubs (and may be co-sponsored by Rotaract clubs), which provide support and guidance, but they are self- governing and self-supporting. Club membership varies greatly. Clubs can be single gender or mixed, large or small. They can draw from the student body of a single school or from two or more schools in the same community, and welcome home-schooled students. Each year, Interact clubs complete at least two community service projects, one of which furthers international understanding and goodwill. Through these efforts, Interactors develop a network of friendships with local and overseas clubs and learn the importance of * Developing leadership skills and personal integrity * Demonstrating helpfulness and respect for others * Understanding the value of individual responsibility and hard work * Advancing international understanding and goodwill As one of the most significant and fastest-growing programs of Rotary service, with more than 15,000 clubs in more than 145 countries and geographical areas, Interact has become a worldwide phenomenon. Almost 340,000 young people are involved in Interact. Interact stands for ‚ÄúInternational Action‚Äù. = RYLA = RYLA, or Rotary Youth Leadership Awards, is a leadership program for young people aged 14 to 30. The Rotary Youth Leadership Awards program offers Rotarians an opportunity to personally participate in developing qualities of leadership, good citizenship, and personal and professional development in the young people of their communities. RYLA program content and format can be customized to target limited age groups in order to address varying needs and interests within the community. = Rotary Community Corps = The Rotary Community Corps (RCC) is a volunteer organization with an estimated 157,000 non-Rotarian men and women in over 6,800 communities in 78 countries. =Exchanges and scholarships= Some of Rotary's most visible programs include Rotary Youth Exchange (RYE), a student exchange program for students in secondary education. The Rotary Foundation's oldest program, Ambassadorial Scholarships ended in 2013. In July 2009 the Rotary Foundation ended funding for the Cultural and Multi-Year Ambassadorial Scholarships as well as Rotary Grants for University Teachers. Rotary Fellowships, paid by the foundation launched in honor of Paul Harris in 1947, specialize in providing graduate fellowships around the world, usually in countries other than their own in order to provide international exposure and experience to the recipient. Recently, a new program was established known as the Rotary peace and Conflict Resolution program which provides funds for two years of graduate study in one of eight universities around the world. Rotary is naming about 75 of these scholars each year. The applications for these scholarships are found on line but each application must be endorsed by a local Rotary Club. Children and other close relatives of Rotarians are not eligible. Adults up to the age of 30 may participate in New Generations Service Exchange for up to six months and may be organized for individuals or groups. The minimum age of the participants shall be the age of majority in the host country, but not be younger than age 18. New Generations Service Exchanges must have a strong humanitarian or vocational service component. = Rotary Peace Centers = Starting in 2002, The Rotary Foundation partnered with eight universities around the world to create the Rotary Centers for International Studies in peace and conflict resolution. The universities included International Christian University (Japan), University of Queensland (Australia), Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris (Sciences Po) (France), University of Bradford (UK), Universidad del Salvador (Argentina), University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (US), Duke University (US), and University of California, Berkeley (US) Since then, the Rotary Foundation's Board of Trustees has dropped its association with the Center in France at the Paris Institute of Political Studies, the Center in Argentina at the Universidad del Salvador, and the Center in the US at the University of California. In 2006, a new Rotary Peace Center at Chulalongkorn University (Thailand) began offering a three-month professional development program in peace and conflict studies for mid-level and upper-level professionals. In 2011, the Rotary Peace Center at Uppsala University (Sweden) was established and began offering a two-year master's program in peace and conflict studies. Up to 100 Rotary Peace Fellows are selected annually to earn either a professional development certificate in peace and conflict studies or a master's degree in a range of disciplines related to peace and security. Each Rotary Peace Center offers a unique curriculum and field-based learning opportunities that examine peace and conflict theory through a variety of different frameworks. The first class graduated in 2004. As with many such university programs in \\"peace and conflict studies\\", questions have been raised concerning political bias and controversial grants. The average grant was about $75,000 per fellow for the two-year program and $12,000 per fellow for the three-month certificate program. =Literacy programs= Rotary clubs worldwide place a focus on increasing literacy. Such importance has been placed on literacy that Rotary International has created a \\"Rotary Literacy Month\\" that takes place during the month of March.\\"Rotary Literacy Month: One of the 3 Rs under test.\\" Rotary Times. 29 March 2007. http://rotarytimes1280.typepad.com/rotary_times/2007/03/rotary_literacy.html Access date 17 June 2012. Rotary clubs also aim to conduct many literacy events during the week of September 8, which is International Literacy Day. Some Rotary clubs raise funds for schools and other literacy organizations. Many clubs take part in a reading program called \\"Rotary Readers\\", in which a Rotary member spends time in a classroom with a designated student, and reads one-on-one with them. Some Rotary clubs participate in book donations, both locally and internationally. As well as participating in book donations and literacy events, there are educational titles written about Rotary Clubs and members, such as Rotary Clubs Help People, Carol is a Rotarian by Rotarian and children's book author Bruce Larkin and \\"Rhoda's Rescue\\" by Maine author Barbara Walsh in conjunction with Rotary Club of Waterville, Maine's Rhoda Reads early literacy program.  Publications  Rotary International publishes an official monthly magazine named The Rotarian in English (first published in 1911 as The National Rotarian). From April 1923 to August 1928, \\"The Rotarian\\" was managed and printed from the same building - the Atwell Building - as Rotary's office and headquarters; the building was designed for Atwell Printing and Binding Company by famed Chicago architect, Alfred S. Alschuler. Other periodicals are independently produced in more than 20 different major languages and distributed in 130 countries.

It was acquired by MGM Grand, Inc. in 2000, forming MGM Mirage (now MGM Resorts International). History Golden Nugget Companies Inc. was formed by Steve Wynn in 1973. The company was created after Wynn acquired majority control of the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas, Nevada. In 1980, the company opened the Golden Nugget Atlantic City in New Jersey but in 1987, Wynn's and the company's interest in Atlantic City did not last very long due to frustration with state gaming regulators. The property was sold to Bally's Entertainment, and eventually became Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino. In 1989, the company acquired the Nevada Club casino in Laughlin, Nevada, and re-branded it as the Golden Nugget Laughlin. =The Mirage and Treasure Island (1990s)= Wynn's first major Strip casino was The Mirage, which was the first time Wynn was personally involved with the design and construction of a casino. Wynn's first major casino on the Las Vegas Strip was The Mirage, which opened in November 1989. It was the first time Wynn was involved with the design and construction of a casino, and he financed the $630 million project largely with high-yield bonds issued by Michael Milken. The resort's high cost and emphasis on luxury meant that it was considered high risk at the time, though the project ended up being enormously lucrative. The hotel, with its erupting volcano and South Seas theme, ignited a $12 billion building boom on the Strip. Its construction is also considered noteworthy in that Wynn had set a new standard for Vegas resorts, and when it opened The Mirage was the first casino to use security cameras full-time on all table games.Arnold M. Knightly (February 25, 2007), Blink and you'll miss him, Las Vegas Review-Journal, Page 1E. Known for its entertainment, the hotel became the exclusive venue for the Siegfried & Roy show in 1990, and in 1993 the hotel hosted the Cirque du Soleil show Nouvelle Exp√©rience. Afterwards Wynn decided to invite Cirque to create Myst√®re for the soon-to-be-built Treasure Island resort next door. Following the completion of The Mirage in 1989 Steve Wynn changed the name of the company to Mirage Resorts, Inc. Much of the financing for the Mirage was obtained in cooperation with Michael Milken. After the Mirage, Wynn built the Treasure Island Hotel and Casino, which he opened in the Mirage's old parking lot in 1993, and overall cost $450 million. Intended to be family-friendly, the resort featured pools in front of the casino enacted the Battle of Buccaneer Bay with two full-scaled ships, the pirate ship 'Hispaniola' and the British Royal Navy frigate 'HMS Britannia,' while the inside featured romantic tropical theming. The establishment was the home of the first permanent Cirque du Soleil show in Las Vegas, and the show went on to be voted nine times as the best production show in the city by the Las Vegas Review-Journal reader's poll.LVRJ Readers' Poll In 1994, Gold Strike Resorts announced a partnership with Mirage Resorts to build a $250-million casino targeted at budget- conscious visitors, on part of the site of the demolished Dunes on the Las Vegas Strip. It ultimately opened in 1996, following Gold Strike's merger with Circus Circus Enterprises as Monte Carlo Resort and Casino and was built as a joint venture between Mirage Resorts and Circus Circus Enterprises, and cost US$344 million to build. The resort sits on , occupied by the Dunes Hotel golf course until its demolition in October 1993. In 1995, the company proposed to build the Le Jardin hotel-casino in the marina area if the state of New Jersey built a road that connected to the hotel-casino. The company had also agreed to allow Circus Circus Enterprises and Boyd Gaming to build casinos on the site, but later reneged on the agreement. While the road, called the Atlantic City-Brigantine Connector, was eventually built, Le Jardin was cancelled after the company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which later built the Borgata, in a joint venture with Boyd Gaming, on the site.The Tale of MGM Grand Atlantic City, Borgata and Le JardinWhen Atlantic City projects had to be big, so were the ideas ... and the failures The Press of Atlantic City May 14, 2010 Mirage Reshuffles Deal in Mega-Resort Plan Ocala Star-Banner January 21, 1998 Boardwalk Hotel and Casino was later acquired by Mirage Resorts in 1997. =Bellagio and Beau Rivage debuts (1998‚Äì1999)= Bellagio, which at the time was the most expensive hotel in the world. Like Wynn's previous resorts, the Bellagio features an extensive water show on the Strip. In October 1998, Wynn opened the even more opulent Bellagio, a $1.6 billion resort considered among the world‚Äôs most spectacular hotels. The architect was Jon Jerde of The Jerde Partnerships, and construction was handled by Mirage Resorts, Inc. When built, the Bellagio was the most expensive hotel in the world. In front of the hotel are the Fountains of Bellagio‚Äîshooting fountains choreographed to music that ‚Äúdance‚Äù on the hotel‚Äôs 8.5 acre man-made lake‚Äîwhich are now considered Las Vegas landmarks. The Bellagio is credited with starting a new spree of luxurious developments in Las Vegas. Among these developments include The Venetian, Mandalay Bay, and Paris Las Vegas. Wynn brought Mirage Resorts‚Äô style to Biloxi, Mississippi in 1999, where he oversaw development of the 1,835-room Beau Rivage. Themed to blend Mediterranean beauty with Southern hospitality, the resort was part of a building boom that established Biloxi as a regional tourism center along the Mississippi Gulf Coast. Beau Rivage was originally the name Wynn wanted to give the Bellagio, though he had decided on Bellagio after vacationing in the Italian region of the same name. Beau Rivage opened as the largest hotel-casino to be built outside Nevada. The casino was initially located on a series of floating barges as required by local law confining all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time of the resort's construction. The hotel, restaurants, and associated facilities were constructed on land.Beau Rivage's Website The company was acquired in 2000 by MGM Grand Inc., which then changed its name to MGM Mirage, for $6.4 billion, including $2 billion in assumed debt, after an initial all-cash offer of $17 per share and a final offer of $21 per share. The company was majority owned by Wynn.

An example of such a seal is sometimes found within an axle's bearing to help prevent the leakage of the oil lubricating the bearing. A labyrinth seal may be composed of many grooves that press tightly inside another axle, or inside a hole, so that the fluid has to pass through a long and difficult path to escape. Sometimes screw threads exist on the outer and inner portion. These interlock, to produce the long characteristic path which slows leakage. For labyrinth seals on a rotating shaft, a very small clearance must exist between the tips of the labyrinth threads and the running surface. The \\"teeth\\" of the labyrinth seal may be on the rotating shaft (Teeth On Rotor - TOR) or on the stator (TOS), or both, in an interlocking configuration.Thermoplastic Labyrinth Seals for Centrifugal Compressors; Proceedings of the Thirty-Third Turbomachinery Symposium Labyrinth seals on rotating shafts provide non-contact sealing action by controlling the passage of fluid through a variety of chambers by centrifugal motion, as well as by the formation of controlled fluid vortices. At higher speeds, centrifugal motion forces the liquid towards the outside and therefore away from any passages. Similarly, if the labyrinth chambers are correctly designed, any liquid that has escaped the main chamber becomes entrapped in a labyrinth chamber, where it is forced into a vortex-like motion. This acts to prevent its escape, and also acts to repel any other fluid. Because these labyrinth seals are non-contact, they do not wear out. Many gas turbine engines, having high rotational speeds, use labyrinth seals due to their lack of friction and long life. Because liquid-filled labyrinth seals still generate heat due to the viscosity of the seal oil, and because seal oil can contaminate the process fluids, modern high-performance gas turbines use dry gas seals which use spring-loaded rings with an inert gas in between the faces of the rings to provide the seal. This creates even lower friction and provides a liquid-free seal. However, such engines often have detectable oil leakage into the compression chamber. Indeed, many gas turbine engine seals leak by design. Labyrinth seals are also found on pistons, which use them to store oil and seal against high pressure during compression and power strokes, as well as on other non-rotating shafts. In these applications, it is the long and difficult path and the formation of controlled fluid vortices plus some limited contact-sealing action that creates the seal.

Viriconium is a series of novels and stories written by M. John Harrison between 1971 and 1984, set in and around the fictional city of the same name. In the first novel in the series, the city of Viriconium exists in a future Earth littered with the technological detritus of millennia (partly inspired by Jack Vance's Dying Earth series, Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast series\\"A Storm of Wings\\" in David Pringle, Modern Fantasy: The 100 Best Novels, Grafton Books, 1988 (pp. 201-203). and the poems of T. S. Eliot). However, variations of the city appear throughout the series (most frequently as Uriconium and Vriko), in an attempt by Harrison to subvert the concept of thoroughly-mapped secondary worlds featured in certain works of fantasy, particularly those by J. R. R. Tolkien and his host of successors.\\"What It Might Be Like To Live In Viriconium,\\" by M. John Harrison Both universal and in particular, the city has a shifting topography and history, and is sometimes known by names such as 'Uroconium' (though there does not seem to be any association with the old Roman town of Viroconium). The Pastel City The first Viriconium novel, The Pastel City (1971), presents a civilization in decline where medieval social patterns clash with advanced technology and superscience energy weapons that the citizens of the city know how to use but have forgotten how to engineer. Harrison's leading character, Lord tegeus-Cromis, fancies himself a better poet than swordsman; yet he leads the battle to save Viriconium, the Pastel City, from the brain- stealing automatons known as the geteit chemosit from Earth's past. The decadence Harrison describes is reminiscent of Michael Moorcock's vision of the far future in The End of All Songs. David Pringle wrote of the novel: \\"This is a sword-and-sorcery tale, yet it borders on sf by virtue of its distant future setting and the conceit that most of the 'magic' is in fact ancient, little-understood science. Despite its obvious debts to Jack Vance and Michael Moorcock, it's a very moody and stylish entertainment.David Pringle, The Ultimate Guide to Science Fiction. Grafton, 1990, p. 67 Reviewing the novel for Delap's F & SF, Michael Bishop opined that \\"my own gut feeling is that M. John Harrison is wasting his time and his gift with this sort of material\\" but that \\"if you like elegantly crafted, elegantly written sword and sorcery, this book is all you could ask for.\\" Delap's F & Sf (Jan 1977), p. 21. A Storm of Wings The more complex second novel of the Viriconium sequence, which is also borderline sf, is A Storm of Wings (1980). It is set eighty years later than The Pastel City and stylistically it is far denser and more elaborate than the first novel. Fay Glass and Alstath Fulthor of the Reborn Men, awoken from their long sleep, try to alert the powers of Viriconium that the northern highlands are overrun by insectile armies. A race of intelligent insects is invading Earth as human interest in survival wanes. Fay brings the severed head of an invading locust-like giant insect to show the extent of the disaster. The story is told through both human and alien points of view and perceptions. The main characters are a resurrected man, an assassin, a magician, a madwoman, and Tomb, the Iron Dwarf. Harrison depicts the workings of civilization on the verge of collapse and the heroic efforts of individuals to help it sustain itself a little longer. In Viriconium The novel In Viriconium (1982) (US title: The Floating Gods) was nominated for the Guardian Fiction Prize during 1982. Savoy Books catalogs referred to it as \\"Pre-raphaelite sword and sorcery\\". It is a moody portrait of Viriconium beset by a mysterious plague. As artist Audsley King slowly dies from the plague, her friend Ashlyme tries to save her. It is a desperate, misconceived enterprise which draws Ashlyme into unwilling alliance with the sinister dwarf The Grand Cairo, and which goes bizarrely wrong. Yet out of the shambles comes the clue to lifting the plague, which symbolises a paralysis of will. Where the previous books in the series held some sword and sorcery elements, In Viriconium goes beyond black humour into a coma of despair. The novel parodies Arthurian motifs. The novel is divided into sections named after cards of an imaginary Tarot. Resonances in the text include the art of Aubrey Beardsley, post-Impressionist art, Mervyn Peake and Wyndham Lewis. Short stories The short fiction of the Viriconium sequence replays the attrition of the novels; finally, in \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\" (later retitled \\"A Young Man's Journey to London\\"), Viriconium has become little more than a dream. Harrison has frequently used the Tarot as a motif in his work, as in Viriconium Nights (which is divided into sections named after cards of an imaginary Tarot) and in his story The Horse of Iron (and How We Can Know It and Be Changed by It Forever). The collection Viriconium Nights consists of various stories (the number varies depending whether one considers the Ace 1984 edition or the Gollancz 1985 edition). All are vignettes of night life in the Pastel City. In \\"The Lamia and Lord Cromis\\", tegeus-Cromis (who recurs in \\"Lords of Misrule\\" and is the protagonist of The Pastel City), a dwarf, and a man named Dissolution Kahn travel to a poisonous bog to destroy a dangerous Lamia. The mission ends in confusion and despair. In the story \\"Viriconium Knights\\", the elderly swordsman Osgerby Practal is defeated in a duel by Ignace Retz, an unpopular servant of the Queen. Retz uses a power knife, a relic of previous times when high technology was used, but which is now ill understood; the badly-functioning power knife gives off floating motes which harm the wielder. (In this, Harrison invents his own variant of Moorcock's soul-draining magic swords in the Elric stories). The Queen is the grotesque Mammy Vooley, whose \\"body was like a long ivory pole about which they had draped the faded purple gown of her predecessor. On it was supported a very small head which looked as if had been partly scalped, partly burned, and partly starved to death in a cage suspended above the Gabelline Gate. One of her eyes was missing. She sat on an old carved wooden throne with iron wheels, in the middle of a tall limewashed room that had five windows.\\"M. John Harrison, Viriconium, London: Millennium, 2000, p. 9 Retz has ambitions to seek treasure in the broad wastes south and west of Viriconium, and petitions the Queen to allow him to keep the power knife so he may defend himself against his enemies. When she refuses, he uses the knife to cut off her hand, and flees, hunted through the city by various factions of \\"aristocratic thugs\\" such as the Locust Clan and the Yellow Paper Men. Taking refuge in the house of an old man who shows him a strange tapestry, he beholds various visions of himself, seemingly at different periods in the city's history, before trying to steal a metal eagle from the old man's room. The metal eagle comes to life, attacking him, and Retz barely escapes. Later, he finds himself on a wasteland where some men are trying to bury a body with a fish-mask on its head. Retz steals the clothes and mask from the body and continues on his way. In \\"The Luck in the Head\\", in the Artists' Quarter, the poet Ardwick Crome has been having a recurring dream about a ceremony called \\"the Luck in the Head.\\" He wants these disturbing dreams to stop, so he goes looking for one of the women in the dream. \\"Strange Great Sins\\" is the story of the weak and silly man Baladine Prinsep, who becomes enamored with the ballet dancer Vera Ghillera and wastes away. The story is told at one remove through the memories of his nephew, an unnamed sin-eater, and through those of his mother and of the singer Madame de Maupassant. In this story the motif of the Mari Lwyd is central. This story looks at the city of Viriconium from the perspective of outsiders who know that those who go there either are, or will become, decadent and self-absorbed. In \\"The Dancer From the Dance\\" the ballerina Vera Ghillera from \\"Strange Great Sins\\" visits Allman's Heath where strange things are afoot. \\"A Young Man's Journey to Viriconium\\", set in our world, explains that Viriconium is a real place and tells you exactly how to get there, in case you want to go. The doorway is a mirror in a bathroom in a caf√© in England. \\"Lords of Misrule\\", narrated in the first person by Harrison's continuing character Lord Cromis, deals with Cromis's visit to a country house where the Yule Greave, formerly a fighter with the Feverfew Anschluss faction of Viriconium, and his wife, live with their young servant Ringmer. An unidentified enemy is gradually encroaching on the country lands and Cromis appears to be surveying their progress. During his visit, he is shown one of the ancient and highly decorated Mari - a version of the Mari Lwyd - used by the people in the 'mast horse ceremony', which Ringmer's father used to operate. The graphic novel The Luck in the Head adapts the short story of that name and is illustrated by Ian Miller. Works * The Pastel City (novel, 1971). * A Storm of Wings (novel, 1980).

Initially a schoolteacher and a jazz enthusiast, he played trumpet in The Mighty Joe Young Jazz Men and the 1960s pop group The Alan Price Set before joining BBC Radio 1 in 1967, where he was John Peel's producer from 1969 to 1991. Biography Walters was born in Long Eaton, near Nottingham. He read Fine Arts at Durham University, where he worked under Victor Pasmore and as a student had his paintings exhibited alongside the works of David Hockney. He then taught at a comprehensive in Kenton, Newcastle-upon-Tyne, wrote a jazz column for the Newcastle Journal, gave evening classes in jazz history, played the trumpet with local bands and met Alan Price, then organist with the Animals. When Price quit to form his own group, Walters was recruited. He featured on five of the Alan Price Set's British hits, and played the Albert Hall and the Paris Olympia. Walters joined the fledgling BBC Radio 1 in 1967 as a staff producer. He soon linked up with DJ John Peel and became his producer, starting in 1969. As a producer for Peel, he turned down the Sex Pistols for a \\"Peel session\\" when, drawing on his experience as a schoolteacher, he said Johnny Rotten \\"didn't look like the kind of boy you would trust to give out the scissors\\". He reportedly regretted this decision later, but was responsible for getting The Smiths their first session after witnessing an early concert. He was also responsible for The Fall's first session, a group which would later become Peel's favourite. Walters and Peel became close friends, with Walters being Peel's best man when he married his wife Sheila, and Peel requesting Walters play Roy Harper's \\"When an Old Cricketer Leaves the Crease\\" as his on-air memorial song if Peel were to pass before Walters. Walters also produced Vivian Stanshall's first foray into radio, both by overseeing Stanshall's Rawlinson End Radio Flashes when Stanshall stood in for a vacationing John Peel, and Stanshall's Sir Henry at Rawlinson End. He presented the long-running Radio 1 arts magazine Walters' Weekly, as well as Loose Ends and Idle thoughts, and was heard reviewing the music papers on the Janice Long show in the 1980s. In the 1990s, he was a reporter on the BBC's current affairs magazine Here and Now. Walters died suddenly on 30 July 2001, from a heart attack, at the age of 62. He was survived by his wife, Helen.

More generally, \\\\kappa is called n-ineffable (for a positive integer n) if for every f : [\\\\kappa]^n\\\\to \\\\\\\\{0,1\\\\\\\\} there is a stationary subset of \\\\kappa on which f is n-homogeneous (takes the same value for all unordered n-tuples drawn from the subset).

In the earliest days, ship captains arriving in port with stampless mail would advertise in the local newspaper names of those having mail and for them to come collect and pay for it, if not already paid for by the sender. Postal delivery in the United States was a matter of haphazard local organization until after the Revolutionary War, when eventually a national postal system was established. Stampless letters, paid for by the receiver, and private postal systems, were gradually phased out after the introduction of adhesive postage stamps, first issued by the U.S. government post office July 1, 1847, in the denominations of five and ten cents, with the use of stamps made mandatory in 1855. The issue and use of adhesive postage stamps continued during the 19th century primarily for first class mail. Each of these stamps generally bore the face or bust of an American president or another historically important statesman. However, once the Post Office realized during the 1890s that it could increase revenues by selling stamps as \\"collectibles,\\" it began issuing commemorative stamps, first in connection with important national expositions, later for the anniversaries of significant American historical events. Continued technological innovation subsequently prompted the introduction of special stamps, such as those for use with airmail, zeppelin mail, registered mail, certified mail, and so on. Postage due stamps were issued for some time and were pasted by the post office to letters having insufficient postage with the postage due to be paid to the postal carrier at the receiving address. Today, stamps issued by the post office are self-adhesive, and no longer require that the stamps be \\"licked\\" to activate the glue on their back. In many cases, post office clerks now use Postal Value Indicators (PVI), which are computer labels, instead of stamps. Where for a century-and-a-half or so, stamps were almost invariably denominated with their values (5 cent, 10 cent, etc.) the United States post office now sells non-denominated \\"forever\\" stamps for use on first-class and international mail.\\"Forever Stamps Fact Sheet\\" United States Postal Service These stamps are still valid even if there is a rate increase. However, for other uses, adhesive stamps with denomination indicators are still available and sold. Early postal history Postal services began in the first half of the 17th century serving the first American colonies; today, the United States Postal Service is a large government organization providing a wide range of services across the United States and its territories abroad. B. Free Franklin Post Office in Philadelphia In the American colonies, informal independently run postal routes began in Boston as early as 1639, with Boston to New York City service starting in 1672. Officially sanctioned mail service began in 1692 when King William III granted to an English nobleman a delivery \\"patent\\" that included the exclusive right to establish and collect a formal postal tax on official documents of all kinds. (Years later, taxation implemented through the mandatory purchase of stamps was an issue that helped to spark the American Revolution.) The tax was repealed a year later, and very few were ever actually used in the thirteen colonies, but they saw service in Canada and the British Caribbean islands. In the years leading up to the American Revolution mail routes among the colonies existed along the few roads between Boston, New York and Philadelphia. In the middle 18th century, individuals like Benjamin Franklin and William Goddard were the colonial postmasters who managed the mails then and were the general architects of a postal system that started out as an alternative to the Crown Post (the colonial mail system then) which was now becoming more distrusted as the American Revolution drew near. The postal system that Franklin and Goddard forged out of the American Revolution became the standard for the new U.S. Post Office and is a system whose basic designs are still used in the United States Postal Service today. Post offices and postmarks Visualizing US expansion through post offices, 1700 to 1900. In 1775, when Benjamin Franklin was appointed the first Postmaster General, the U.S. Post Office was born. So important was the Postmaster General that in 1829 this position was included among those in the President's Cabinet. As America began to grow and new towns and villages began to appear, so too did the Post Office along with them. The dates and postmarks generated from these places often has provided the historian with a window into a given time and place in question. Each postmark is uniquely distinctive with its own name of state and town, in addition to its distinctive date. Post Offices that existed along railroad lines and at various military posts have their own special historical aspect. Mail and postmarks generated from prisoner of war camps during the Civil War, or from aboard naval ships, each with a U.S. Post Office aboard, can and have offered amazing insights into United States history and are avidly sought after by historians and collectors alike. Between 1874 and 1976 post offices were categorized from first to fourth classes based on the amount of revenue they generated, with first being the highest.

Before the introduction of stamps, it was the recipient of mail‚Äînot the sender‚Äîwho generally paid the cost of postage, giving the fee directly to the postman on delivery. The task of collecting money for letter after letter greatly slowed the postman on his route. Moreover, the addressee would at times refuse a piece of mail, which then had to be taken back to the Post Office (post office budgets always allowed for an appreciable volume of unpaid-for mail). Only occasionally did a sender pay delivery costs in advance, an arrangement that usually required a personal visit to the Post Office. To be sure, postmasters allowed some citizens to run charge accounts for their delivered and prepaid mail, but bookkeeping on these constituted another inefficiency.History of Stamps The American Philatelic Society. Stamps.orgTiffany, John K. \\"History of the Postage Stamps of the United States of America\\". St. Louis: C.H. Mekeel, Philatelic Publishers (1887). pp. 13-18 Postage stamps revolutionized this process, leading to universal prepayment; but a precondition for their issue by a nation was the establishment of standardized rates for delivery throughout the country. If postal fees were to remain (as they were in many lands) a patchwork of many different jurisdictional rates, the use of stamps would only produce limited gains in efficiency, for postal clerks would still have to spend time calculating the rates on many letters: only then would senders know how much postage to put on them.Tiffany 1887 pp. 23-26 Provisional issue stamps New York Postmaster's Provisional, 1845 Provisional stamp from Providence, Rhode Island. The introduction of postage stamps in the UK in May 1840 was received with great interest in the United States (and around the world). Later that year, Daniel Webster rose in the U.S. Senate to recommend that the recent English postal reforms‚Äîstandardized rates and the use of postage stamps‚Äîbe adopted in America.Mekeel's & Stamps Magazine, Vol. 200 Issue 25, p. 21 : \\"Daniel Webster, the Father of U.S. Stamps,\\" by Ralph A. Barry (reprinted from \\"Stamps Magazine,\\" June 19, 1937) It would be private enterprise, however, that brought stamps to the U. S. On February 1, 1842 a new carrier service called \\"City Despatch Post\\" began operations in New York City, introducing the first adhesive postage stamp ever produced in the western hemisphere, which it required its clients to use for all mail. This stamp was a 3¬¢ issue bearing a rather amateurish drawing of George Washington, printed from line engraved plates in sheets of 42 images. The company had been founded by Henry Thomas Windsor, a London merchant who at the time was living in Hoboken, New Jersey. Alexander M. Greig was advertised as the post's \\"agent,\\" and as a result, historians and philatelists have tended to refer to the firm simply as \\"Greig's City Despatch Post,\\" making no mention of Windsor. Stampuoso.com In another innovation, the company placed mail-collection boxes around the city for the convenience of its customers. A few months after its founding, the City Despatch Post was sold to the U.S. Government, which renamed it the \\"United States City Despatch Post.\\" The government began operation of this local post on August 16, 1842, under an Act of Congress of some years earlier that authorized local delivery. Greig, retained by the Post Office to run the service, kept the firm's original Washington stamp in use, but soon had its lettering altered to reflect the name change. In its revised form, this issue accordingly became the first postage stamp produced under the auspices of a government in the western hemisphere. An Act of Congress of March 3, 1845 (effective July 1, 1845), established uniform (and mostly reduced) postal rates throughout the nation, with a uniform rate of five cents for distances under 300 miles (500 km) and ten cents for distances between 300 and 3000 miles.Chap. XLIII 5 Stat. 732 from \\"A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875\\" . Library of Congress, Law Library of Congress. Retrieved 2012-03-22. However, Congress did not authorize the production of stamps for nationwide use until 1847; still, postmasters realized that standard rates now made it feasible to produce and sell \\"provisional\\" issues for prepayment of uniform postal fees, and printed these in bulk. Such provisionals included both prepaid envelopes and stamps, mostly of crude design, the New York Postmaster's Provisional being the only one of quality comparable to later stamps. The provisional issues of Baltimore were notable for the reproduced signature of the city's postmaster--James M. Buchanan (1803-1876), a cousin to President James Buchanan. All provisional issues are rare, some inordinately so: at a Siegel Gallery auction in New York in March 2012, an example of the Millbury provisional fetched $400,000, while copies of the Alexandria and Annapolis provisionals each sold for $550,000. Eleven cities printed provisional stamps in 1845 and 1846: Provisional stamp issued in St. Louis, Missouri * Alexandria, Virginia (\\"ALEXANDRIA POST OFFICE\\" in circle) * Annapolis, Maryland (eagle in circle) * Baltimore, Maryland (James Buchanan signature) * Boscawen, New Hampshire (\\"PAID / 5 / CENTS\\") * Brattleboro, Vermont (shaded box with postmaster initials inside) * Lockport, New York (\\"LOCKPORT N.Y.\\" in oval) * Millbury, Massachusetts (woodcut of George Washington) * New Haven, Connecticut (\\"POST OFFICE\\" in box, P.M. signature) * New York, New York (\\"POST OFFICE\\" over Washington portrait) * Providence, Rhode Island (\\"POST OFFICE / PROV. R.I.\\" in shaded box) * St. Louis, Missouri (St. Louis Bears, Missouri coat of arms) (See also:A Gallery of U. S. Postmasters' Provisional Stamps, 1845-47.) The 1845 Congressional act did, in fact, raise the rate on one significant class of mail: the so-called \\"drop letter\\"‚Äîi. e., a letter delivered from the same post office that collected it. Previously one cent, the drop letter rate became two cents. First national postage stamps Benjamin Franklin ‚Äî George WashingtonThe First U.S. Postage Stamps, issued 1847. The first stamp issues were authorized by an act of Congress and approved on March 3, 1847. The earliest known use of the Franklin 5¬¢ is July 7, 1847, while the earliest known use of the Washington 10¬¢ is July 2, 1847. Remaining in postal circulation for only a few years, these issues were declared invalid for postage on July 1, 1851.Scotts Specialized Catalogue of United States Stamps Congress finally provided for the issuance of stamps by passing an act on March 3, 1847, and the Postmaster- General immediately let a contract to the New York City engraving firm of Rawdon, Wright, Hatch, and Edson.Chap. LXIII. 9 Stat. 188 from \\"A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875\\". Library of Congress, Law Library of Congress. Retrieved 2012-03-22. The first stamp issue of the U.S. was offered for sale on July 1, 1847, in New York City, with Boston receiving stamps the following day and other cities thereafter. They consisted of an engraved 5-cent red brown stamp depicting Benjamin Franklin (the first postmaster of the U.S.), and a 10-cent value in black with George Washington. Like all U.S. stamps until 1857, they were imperforate. The 5-cent stamp paid for a letter weighing less than 1/2 ounce and traveling up to 300 miles, the 10-cent stamp for deliveries to locations greater than 300 miles, or, twice the weight deliverable for the 5-cent stamp. Each stamp was hand engraved in what is believed to be steel, and laid out in sheets of 200 stamps. The 5-cent stamp is often found today with very poor impressions because the type of ink used contained small pieces of quartz that wore down the steel plates used to print the stamp. On the other hand, most 10-cent stamps are of strong impressions. A fresh and brilliantly printed 5-cent stamp is prized by collectors. The use of stamps was optional: letters could still be sent requiring payment of postage on delivery. Indeed, the post office did not issue any 2-cent value for prepaying drop letters in 1847, and these continued to be handled as they had been. Nevertheless, many Americans took up using stamps; about 3,700,000 of the 5¬¢ and about 865,000 of the 10¬¢ were sold, and enough of those have survived to ensure a ready supply for collectors, although the demand is such that a very fine 5¬¢ sells for around $300 as of 2019, and the 10¬¢ in very fine condition sells for around $1,000 in used form. Unused stamps are much scarcer, fetching around $3,000 and $20,000 respectively, if in very fine condition. One can pay as little as 5 to 10 percent of these figures if the stamps are in poor condition. The post office had become so efficient by 1851 that Congress was able to reduce the common rate to three cents (which remained unchanged for over thirty years), necessitating a new issue of stamps. Moreover, the common rate now applied to letters carried up to 3000 miles. This rate, however, only applied to prepaid mail: a letter sent without a stamp still cost the recipient five cents‚Äîclear evidence that Congress envisioned making stamp use mandatory in the future (it did so in 1855). The 1-cent drop-letter rate was also restored, and Post Office plans did not at first include a stamp for it; later, however, an essay for a 6-cent Franklin double-weight stamp was converted into a drop-letter value. Along with this 1¬¢ stamp, the post office initially issued only two additional denominations in the series of 1851: 3¬¢ and 12¬¢, the three stamps going on sale that July and August. Since the 1847 stamps no longer conformed to any postal rate, they were declared invalid after short period during which the public could exchange old stamps for new ones. Ironically, however, within a few years the Post Office found that stamps in the old denominations were needed after all, and so, added a 10¬¢ value to the series in 1855, followed by a 5¬¢ stamp the following year. The full series included a 1¬¢ profile of Franklin in blue, a 3¬¢ profile of Washington in red brown, a 5¬¢ portrait of Thomas Jefferson, and portraits of Washington for 10¬¢ green and 12¬¢ black values. The 1¬¢ stamp achieved notoriety, at least among philatelists, because production problems (the stamp design was too tall for the space provided) led to a welter of plate modifications done in piecemeal fashion, and there are no fewer than seven major varieties, ranging in price from $100 to $200,000 (the latter for the only stamp of the 200 images on the first plate that displays the design's top and bottom ornamentation complete). Sharp-eyed collectors periodically find the rare types going unrecognized.

These higher denominations, especially the 90c value, were available for such a short time (a little over a year) that they had virtually no chance of being used. The 90c stamp used is a very rare item, and so frequently forged that authorities counsel collectors to shun cancelled copies that lack expert certification. In February 1861, a congressional act directed that \\"cards, blank or printed. . .shall also be deemed mailable matter, and charged with postage at the rate of one cent an ounce.\\" Private companies soon began issuing post cards, printed with a rectangle in the top right corner where the stamp was to be affixed. (The Post Office would not produce pre-stamped \\"postal cards\\" for another dozen years.) The issue was declared invalid for postage in May 1861, as the Confederate States had supplies of them. Therefore, stamps used after that date usually have the marking \\"OLD STAMPS/NOT RECOGNIZED\\" on the cover. Issues of the Civil War era Benjamin Franklin. Issue of 1861 thumbrightuprightThomas Jefferson. Issue of 1861 The \\"Black Jack\\" Issue of 1863 The outbreak of the American Civil War threw the postal system into turmoil. On April 13, 1861, (the day after the firing on Fort Sumter) John H. Reagan, postmaster-general of the Confederate States of America, ordered local postmasters to return their U.S. stamps to Washington D.C. (although it is unlikely that many did so), while in May the Union decided to withdraw and invalidate all existing U.S. stamps, and to issue new stamps. Confederate post offices were left without legitimate stamps for several months, and while many reverted to the old system of cash payment at the post office, over 100 post offices across the South came up with their own provisional issues. Many of these are quite rare, with only single examples surviving of some types. Eventually the Confederate government issued its own stamps; see stamps and postal history of the Confederate States. In the North, the new stamp designs became available in August, and old stamps were accepted in exchange, with different deadlines for replacement set for different regions of the country, first ranging from September 10 to November 1, later modified to November 1 to January 1, 1862. The whole process was very confusing to the public, and there are number of covers from 1862 and later with 1857 stamps and bearing the marking \\"OLD STAMPS NOT RECOGNIZED\\". The 1861 stamps had in common the letters \\"U S\\" in their design. To make them differentiable from the older stamps at a glance, all were required to have their values expressed in Arabic numerals (in the previous series, Arabic numerals had appeared only on the 30¬¢ stamp). The original issue included all the denominations offered in the previous series: 1¬¢, 3¬¢, 5¬¢, 10¬¢, 12¬¢, 24¬¢, 30¬¢ and 90¬¢ stamps. Numerals apart, several of these are superficially similar to their earlier counterparts‚Äîparticularly because Franklin, Washington and Jefferson still appear on the same denominations as previously. Differences in the design of the frames are more readily apparent. A 2¬¢ stamp in black featuring Andrew Jackson was issued in 1863 and is now known to collectors as the \\"Black Jack\\". A black 15¬¢ stamp depicting the recently assassinated Abraham Lincoln was issued in 1866, and is generally considered part of the same series. While it was not officially described as such, and the 15¬¢ value was chosen to cover newly established fee for registered letters, many philatelists consider this to be the first memorial stamp ever issued. The war greatly increased the amount of mail in the North; ultimately about 1,750,000,000 copies of the 3¬¢ stamp were printed, and a great many have survived to the present day, typically selling for 2-3 dollars apiece. Most are rose-colored; pink versions are much rarer and quite expensive, especially the \\"pigeon blood pink\\", which goes for $3,000 and up. The stamps of the 1861 series, unlike those of the two previous issues, remained valid for postage after they had been superseded‚Äîas has every subsequent United States stamp. =Pony Express= Pony Express mail In 1860, the U.S. Post Office incorporated the services of the Pony Express to get mail to and from San Francisco, an important undertaking with the outbreak of the Civil War, as a communication link between Union forces and San Francisco and the West Coast was badly needed. The Pony Express Trail from St. Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, was 1,840 miles long. Upon arrival in Sacramento, the U.S. mail was placed on a steamer and continued down the Sacramento River to San Francisco for a total of 1,966 miles. The Pony Express was a short-lived enterprise, remaining in operation for only 18 months. Consequently, there is little surviving Pony Express mail today, only 250 examples known in existence. =Encased postage stamps= 145px Widespread hoarding of coins during the Civil War created a shortage, prompting the use of stamps for currency. To be sure, the fragility of stamps made them unsuitable for hand- to-hand circulation, and to solve this problem, John Gault invented the encased postage stamp in 1862. A normal U. S. stamp was wrapped around a circular cardboard disc and then placed inside a coin-like circular brass jacket. A transparent mica window in the jacket allowed the face of the stamp to be seen. All eight denominations available in 1861‚Äì62, ranging from 1 cent to 90 cents, were offered in encased versions. Raised lettering on the metal backs of the jackets often advertised the goods or services of business firms; these included the Aerated Bread Company; Ayers Sarsaparilla and Cathartic Pills; Burnett's Cocoaine; Sands Ale; Drake's Plantation Bitters; Buhl & Co. Hats and Furs; Lord & Taylor; Tremont House, Chicago; Joseph L. Bates Fancy Goods; White the Hatter, New York City; and Ellis McAlpin & Co. Dry Goods, Cincinnati. (See also: Fractional currency.) Grills grill on an 1869 issue During the 1860s, the postal authorities became concerned about postage stamp reuse. While there is little evidence that this occurred frequently, many post offices had never received any canceling devices. Instead, they improvised a canceling process by scribbling on the stamp with an ink pen (\\"pen cancellation\\"), or whittling designs in pieces of cork, sometimes very creatively (\\"fancy cancels\\"), to mark the stamps. However, since poor-quality ink could be washed from the stamp, this method would only have been moderately successful. A number of inventors patented various ideas to attempt to solve the problem. The Post Office eventually adopted the grill, a device consisting of a pattern of tiny pyramidal bumps that would emboss the stamp, breaking up the fibers so that the ink would soak in more deeply, and thus be difficult to clean off. While the patent survives (No. 70,147), much of the actual process of grilling was not well documented, and there has been considerable research trying to recreate what happened and when. Study of the stamps shows that there were eleven types of grill in use, distinguished by size and shape (philatelists have labeled them with letters A-J and Z), and that the practice started some time in 1867 and was gradually abandoned after 1871. A number of grilled stamps are among the great rarities of US philately. The United States 1¬¢ Z grill was long thought to be the rarest of all U.S. stamps, with only two known to exist. In 1961, however, it was discovered that the 15¬¢ stamp of the same series also existed in a Z grill version; this stamp is just as rare as the 1¬¢, for only two examples of the 15¬¢ Z grill are known. Rarer still may be the 30¬¢ stamp with the I Grill, the existence of which was discovered only recently: as of October 2011, only one copy is known.Outstanding United States Stamps, Sale 1014, October 12‚Äì14, 2011, p. 81 1869 Declaration of Independence Horse & rider, Pony Express In 1868, the Post Office contracted with the National Bank Note Company to produce new stamps with a variety of designs. These came out in 1869, and were notable for the variety of their subjects; the 2¬¢ depicted a Pony Express rider, the 3¬¢ a locomotive, the 12¬¢ the steamship Adriatic, the 15¬¢ the landing of Christopher Columbus, and the 24¬¢ the signing of the Declaration of Independence. Other innovations in what has become known as the 1869 Pictorial Issue included the first use of two-color printing on U.S. stamps, and as a consequence the first invert errors. Although popular with collectors today, the unconventional stamps were not very popular among a population who was accustomed to postage that bore classic portrayals of Washington, Franklin and other forefathers. Consequently, the Post Office recalled all remaining stocks after one year. Bank Notes Washington American Bank Note 1883 issue Oliver Hazard Perry National Bank Note 1870 issue The postage stamps issued in the 1870s and 1880s are collectively known as the \\"Bank Notes\\" because they were produced by the National Bank Note Company, the Continental Bank Note Company, then the American Bank Note Company. After the 1869 fiasco with pictorial stamp issues, the new Postmaster-General decided to base a series of stamps on the \\"heads, in profile, of distinguished deceased Americans\\" using \\"marble busts of acknowledged excellence\\" as models. George Washington was returned to the normal-letter-rate stamp: he had played that role in the issues of 1851 and 1861 and would continue to do so in every subsequent definitive set until the Presidential Series of 1938. But the large banknotes did not represent a total retreat to past practices, for the range of celebrated Americans was widened beyond Franklin and various presidents to include notables such as Henry Clay and Oliver Hazard Perry. Moreover, while images of statesmen had provided the only pictorial content of pre-1869 issues, the large banknotes did not entirely exclude other representative images. Two denominations of the series accompanied their portraits with iconographic images appropriate to the statesmen they honored: rifles, a cannon and cannonballs appeared in the bottom corners of the 24-cent issue devoted to General Winfield Scott, while the 90-cent stamp framed Admiral Oliver Perry within a nautically hitched oval of rope and included anchors in the bottom corners of its design. National first printed these, then in 1873 Continental received the contract‚Äîand the plates that National used. Continental added secret marks to the plates of the lower values, distinguishing them from the previous issues. The American Bank Note Company acquired Continental in 1879 and took over the contract, printing similar designs on softer papers and with some color changes. Major redesigning, however, came only in 1890, when the American Bank Note Company issued a new series in which stamp-size was reduced by about 10% (the so- called \\"Small Bank Notes\\"). In 1873, the Post Office began producing a pre- stamped post card. One side was printed with a Liberty-head one-cent stamp design, along with the words \\"United States Postal Card\\" and three blank lines provided for the mailing address. Six years later, it introduced a series of seven Postage Due stamps in denominations ranging from 1¬¢ to 50¬¢, all printed in the same brownish-red color and conforming to the same uniform and highly utilitarian design, with their denominations rendered in numerals much larger than those found on definitive stamps. The design remained unchanged until 1894, and only four different postage due designs have appeared to date. In 1883, the first-class letter rate was reduced from 3¬¢ to 2¬¢, prompting a redesign of the existing 3¬¢ green Washington stamp, which now became a 2¬¢ brown issue. =Special Delivery= First Special Delivery stamp, 1885 In 1885 the Post Office established a Special Delivery service, issuing a ten-cent stamp depicting a running messenger, along with the wording \\"secures immediate delivery at a special delivery office.\\" Initially, only 555 such offices existed but the following year all U. S. Post Offices were obliged to provide the service‚Äîan extension not, however, reflected on the Special Delivery stamp until 1888, when the words \\"at any post office\\" appeared on its reprint. (On stamps of future years, the messenger would be provided the technological enhancements of a bicycle [1902] a motorcycle [1922] and a truck [1925]. Although the last new U.S. Special Delivery stamp appeared issued in 1971, the service was continued until 1997, by which time it had largely been supplanted by Priority Mail delivery, introduced in 1989.) The 1885 Special Delivery issue was the first U.S. postage stamp designed in the double-width format. Eight years later, this shape would be chosen for the Columbian Exposition commemoratives, as it offered appropriate space for historical tableaux. The double-width layout would subsequently be employed in many United States Commemoratives. Columbian Issue Issue of 1893 The World Columbian Exposition of 1893 commemorated the 400th anniversary of the landing of Christopher Columbus in the Americas. The Post Office got in on the act, issuing a series of 16 stamps depicting Columbus and episodes in his career, ranging in value from 1¬¢ to $5 (a princely sum in those days). They are often considered the first commemorative stamps issued by any country. The stamps were interesting and attractive, designed to appeal to not only postage stamps collectors but to historians, artists and of course the general public who bought them in record numbers because of the fanfare of the Columbian Exposition of the World's Fair of 1892 in Chicago, Illinois. They were quite successful (a great contrast to the pictorials of 1869), with lines spilling out of the nation's post offices to buy the stamps. They are prized by collectors today with the $5 denomination, for example, selling for between $1,500 to $12,500 or more, depending upon the condition of the stamp being sold. Another release in connection with the Columbian series was a reprint of the 1888 Special Delivery stamp, now colored orange (reportedly, to prevent postal clerks from confusing it with the 1¬¢ Columbian). After sales of the series ceased, the Special Delivery stamp reappeared in its original blue. Bureau issues Also during 1893, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing competed for the postage stamp printing contract, and won it on the first try. For the postage issues of the 1894 series, the Bureau took over the plates of the 1890 small banknote series but modified them by adding triangles to the upper corners of the designs. Three new designs were needed, because the Post Office elected to add $1, $2 and $5 stamps to the series (previously, the top value of any definitive issue had been 90¬¢). On many of the 1894 stamps, perforations are of notably poor quality, but the Bureau would soon make technical improvements. In 1895 counterfeits of the 2¬¢ value were discovered, which prompted the BEP to begin printing stamps on watermarked paper for the first time in U.S. postal history. The watermarks imbedded the logo U S P S into the paper in double-lined letters. The Bureau's definitive issues of the 1890s consisted of 13 different denominations ranging from 1 cent to 5 dollars, and may be differentiated by the presence or absence of this watermark, which would appear on all U. S. Postage stamps between 1895 and 1910. The final issue of 1898 altered the colors of many denominations to bring the series into conformity with the recommendations of the Universal Postal Union (an international body charged with facilitating the course of transnational mail). The aim was to ensure that in all its member nations, stamps for given classes of mail would appear in the same colors. Accordingly, U.S. 1¬¢ stamps (postcards) were now green and 5¬¢ stamps (international mail) were now blue, while 2¬¢ stamps remained red. (As a result, it was also necessary to replace the blue and green on higher values with other colors.) U.S. postage continued to reflect this color-coding quite strictly until the mid-1930s, continuing also in the invariable use of purple for 3¬¢ stamps. Start of the 20th century Trans Mississippi Issue, 1898-1c In 1898, the Trans-Mississippi Exposition opened in Omaha, Nebraska, and the Post Office was ready with the Trans-Mississippi Issue. The nine stamps were originally to be two-toned, with black vignettes surrounded by colored frames, but the BEP, its resources overtaxed by the needs of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, simplified the printing process, issuing the stamps in single colors. They were received favorably, though with less excitement than the Columbians; but like the Columbians, they are today prized by collectors, and many consider the $1 \\"Western Cattle in Storm\\" the most attractive of all U.S. stamps. Pan-American Issue, 1901-2c Collectors, still smarting from the expense of the Columbian stamps, objected that inclusion of $1 and $2 issues in the Trans-Mississippi series presented them with an undue financial hardship.Lester G. Brookman, The Nineteenth Century Postage Stamps of the United States (Lindquist, 1947). Accordingly, the next stamp series commemorating a prominent exposition, the Pan-American Exposition held in Buffalo, New York in 1901, was considerably less costly, consisting of only six stamps ranging from in value 1¬¢ to 10¬¢. The result, paradoxically, was a substantial increase in Post Office profits; for, while the higher valued Columbians and Trans-Mississippis had sold only about 20,000 copies apiece, the public bought well over five million of every Pan-American denomination.Scott R. Trepel, Rarity Revealed: The Benjamin K. Miller Collection (Smithsonian National Postal Museum and The New York Public Library, 2006) In the Pan-American series the Post Office realized the plan for two-toned stamps that it had been obliged to abandon during the production of the Trans-Mississippi issue. Upside-down placement of some sheets during the two-stage printing process resulted in the so-called Pan-American invert errors on rare copies of the 1¬¢, 2¬¢ and 4¬¢ stamps. Definitive issues of 1902‚Äì1903 The definitive stamps issued by the U.S. Post Office in 1902‚Äì1903 were markedly different in their overall designs from the regular definitive stamps released over the previous several decades. Among the prominent departures from tradition in these designs was that the names of the subjects were printed out, along with their years of birth and death. (Printed names and birth and death dates are more typically a feature of Commemorative stamps.) Unlike any definitive stamps ever issued before, the 1902‚Äì03 issues also had ornate sculptural frame work redolent of Beaux-Arts architecture about the portrait, often including allegorical figures of different sorts, with several different types of print used to denote the country, denominations and names of the subjects. This series of postage stamps were the first definitive issues to be entirely designed and printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, and their Baroque revival style is much akin to that of the Pan-American commemoratives the Bureau had issued in 1901. There are fourteen denominations ranging from 1-cent to 5-dollars. The 2-cent George Washington stamp appeared with two different designs (the original version was poorly received) while each of the other values has its own individual design. This was the first U.S. definitive series to include the image of a woman: Martha Washington, who appeared on the 8-cent stamp. File:Franklin2 1903-1c.jpgFranklin File:Abraham Lincoln 1903 Issue-5c.jpgLincoln File:Benjamin Harrison 1903 Issue-13c.jpgHarrison File:John Marshall 1903 issue-$5.jpgMarshall Commemorative issues, 1904‚Äì1907 In these years, the postal service continued to produce commemorative sets in conjunction with important national expositions. The Louisiana Purchase Exposition in St. Louis, Missouri in 1904 prompted a set of five stamps, while a trio of stamps commemorated the Jamestown Exposition, held in Norfolk, Virginia in 1907. Washington-Franklin era 1908 saw the beginning of the long-running Washington-Franklin series of stamps. Although there were only two central images, a profile of Washington and one of Franklin, many subtle variants appeared over the years; for the Post Office experimented with half-a-dozen different perforation sizes, two kinds of watermarking, three printing methods, and large numbers of values, all adding to several hundred distinct types identified by collectors. Some are quite rare, but many are extremely common; this was the era of the postcard craze, and almost every antique shop in the U.S. will have some postcards with green 1¬¢ or red 2¬¢ stamps from this series. In 1910 the Post Office began phasing out the double-lined watermark, replacing it by the same U S P S logo in smaller single-line letters. Watermarks were discontinued entirely in 1916. {  Washington issue of 1912  Washington issue of 1917  Franklin issue of 1915  Franklin (The Big Bens) issue of 1918 } Toward the beginning of the Washington-Franklin era, in 1909, the Post Office issued its first individual commemorative stamps‚Äîthree single 2¬¢ issues honoring, respectively, the Lincoln Centennial, the Alaska-Yukon Exposition, and the tercentennial/centennial Hudson-Fulton Celebration in New York. A four-stamp series commemorating the Panama‚ÄìPacific International Exposition in San Francisco, California appeared in 1913, but no further commemoratives were issued until after World War I. The Lincoln Centennial's portrait format distinguished it from all other commemoratives released between 1893 and 1926, which were produced exclusively in landscape format. (The next U. S. commemorative in portrait orientation would be the Vermont Sesquicentennial issue of 1927, and many have appeared since.) Parcel Post Stamp Issued in 1912, this was the first time in history an airplane appeared on a postage stamp. It was also in 1913, in January, that the Post Office introduced domestic parcel post service (a belated development, given that international parcel post service between the United States and other countries began in 1887). A series of twelve Parcel Post stamps intended for this service had already been released in December 1912, ranging in denomination from 1¬¢ to $1. All were printed in red and designed in the wide Columbian format. The eight lowest values illustrated aspects of mail handling and delivery, while higher denominations depicted such industries as Manufacturing, Dairying and Fruit Growing. Five green Parcel Post Postage Due stamps appeared concurrently. It soon became obvious that none of these stamps was needed: parcel postage could easily be paid by definitive or commemorative issues, and normal postage due stamps were sufficient for parcels. When original stocks ran out, no reprints appeared, nor were replacements for either group ever contemplated. However, one denomination introduced in the Parcel Post series‚Äî20¬¢--had proved useful, and the Post Office added this value to the Washington-Franklin issues in 1914, along with a 30¬¢ stamp. On November 3, 1917, the normal letter rate was raised from 2¬¢ to 3¬¢ in support of the war effort. The rate hike was reflected in the first postwar commemorative‚Äîa 3¬¢ \\"victory\\" stamp released on March 3, 1919 (not until July 1 would postal fees return to peacetime levels). Only once before (with the Lincoln Memorial issue of 1909) had the Post Office issued a commemorative stamp unconnected to an important national exposition; and the appearance of the Pilgrim Tercentenary series in 1920 confirmed that a new policy was developing: the Post Office would no longer need the pretext of significant patriotic trade fairs to issue commemoratives: they could now freely produce stamps commemorating the anniversaries of any notable historical figures, organizations or events. The 1920s and 1930s 1923 Freedom, $5, blue and red The stamps of the 1920s were dominated by the Series of 1922, the first new design of definitive stamps to appear in a generation. The lower values mostly depicted various presidents, with the 5c particularly intended as a memorial of the recently deceased Theodore Roosevelt, while the higher values included an \\"American Indian\\" (Hollow Horn Bear), the Statue of Liberty, Golden Gate (without the bridge, which had yet to be built), Niagara Falls, a bison, the Lincoln Memorial and so forth. Higher values of the series (from 17¬¢ through $5) were differentiated from the cheaper stamps by being designed in horizontal (landscape) rather than vertical format, an idea carried over from the \\"big Bens\\" of the Washington-Franklin series. Regular Issues 1922‚Äì1925 Stamp printing was switching from a flat plate press to a rotary press while these stamps were in use, and most come in two perforations as a result; 11 for flat plate, and 11x10.5 for rotary. In 1929, theft problems in the Midwest led to the Kansas-Nebraska overprints on the regular stamps. (See also: Fourth Bureau issue). From 1924 on, commemorative stamps appeared every year. The 1920s saw a number of 150th anniversaries connected with the American Revolutionary War, and a number of stamps were issued in connection with those. These included the first U.S. souvenir sheet, for the Battle of White Plains sesquicentennial, and the first overprint, reading \\"MOLLY / PITCHER\\", the heroine of the Battle of Monmouth. Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926‚Äì1932 =Two Cent Red Sesquicentennial issues of 1926‚Äì1932= During this period, the U.S. Post Office issued more than a dozen 'Two Cent Reds' commemorating the 150th anniversaries of Battles and Events that occurred during the American Revolution. The first among these was the Liberty Bell 150th Anniversary Issue of 1926, designed by Clair Aubrey Huston, and engraved by J.Eissler & E.M.Hall, two among America's most renowned master engravers. The 'Two Cent Reds' were among the last stamps used to carry a letter for 2 cents, the rate changing to 3 cents on July 6, 1932. The rate remained the same for 26 years until it finally changed to 4 cents in 1958. =Graf Zeppelin stamps= Graf Zeppelin The German zeppelins were of much interest during this period, and in 1930 the Department issued special stamps to be used on the Pan-American flight of Graf Zeppelin. Although the Graf Zeppelin stamps are today highly prized by collectors as masterpieces of the engraver's art, in 1930 the recent stock market crash meant that few were able to afford these stamps (the $4.55 value for the set represented a week's food allowance for a family of four). Less than 10 percent of the 1,000,000 of each denomination issued were sold and the remainders were incinerated (the stamps were only available for sale to the public from April 19, 1930, to June 30, 1930). It is estimated that less than 8 percent of the stamps produced survive today and they remain the smallest U.S. issue of the 20th century (only 229,260 of these stamps were ever purchased, and only 61,296 of the $2.60 stamp were sold). In 1932, a set of 12 stamps was issued to celebrate the George Washington's 200th birthday 1932 Washington Bicentennial. For the 2¬¢ value, which satisfied the normal letter rate, the most familiar Gilbert Stuart image of Washington had been chosen. After postal rates rose that July, this 2¬¢ red Washington was redesigned as a 3¬¢ stamp and issued in the purple color that now became ubiquitous among U.S. commemoratives. =The New Deal Era= In 1933, Franklin D. Roosevelt became President. He was notable not only as an avid collector in his own right (with a collection estimated at around 1 million stamps), but also for taking an interest in the stamp issues of the Department, working closely with Postmaster James Farley, the former Democratic Party Committee Chairman. Many designs of the 1930s were inspired or altered according to Roosevelt's advice. In 2009‚Äì10, the National Postal Museum exhibited six Roosevelt sketches that were developed into stamp issues: the 6-cent eagle airmail stamp and five miscellaneous commemoratives, which honored the Byrd Antarctic Expedition, the Mothers of America, Susan B. Anthony, Virginia Dare and the Northwest Territories' rise to statehood. A steady stream of commemoratives appeared during these years, including a striking 1934 issue of ten stamps presenting iconic vistas of ten National Parks‚Äîa set that has remained widely beloved. (In a memorable sequence from Philip Roth's novel The Plot Against America, the young protagonist dreams that his National Parks stamps, the pride and joy of his collection, have become disfigured with swastika overprints.) Choosing an orange color for the 2¬¢ Grand Canyon tableau instead of the standard 2¬¢ carmine red, the Post Office departed from U. P. U. color-coding for the first time. National Parks Issue 1936 Souvenir sheet reproducing four recent three-cent commemoratives With a philatelist in the White House, the Post Office catered to collectors as never before, issuing seven separate souvenir sheets between 1933 and 1937. In one case, a collectors' series had to be produced as the result of a miscalculation. Around 1935, Postmaster Farley removed sheets of the National Parks set from stock before they had been gummed or perforated, giving these and unfinished examples of ten other issues to President Roosevelt and Interior Secretary Harold Ickes (also a philatelist) as curiosities for their collections. When word of these gifts got out, public outcries arose. Some accused Farley of a corrupt scheme to enrich Roosevelt and Ickes by creating valuable rarities for them at taxpayer expense. Stamp aficionados, in turn, demanded that these curiosities be sold to the public so that ordinary collectors could acquire them, and Farley duly issued them in bulk. This series of special printings soon became known as \\"Farley's Follies.\\" As the decade progressed, the purples used for 3¬¢ issues, although still ostensibly conforming to the traditional purple, displayed an increasingly wide variety of hues, and one 1940 issue, a 3¬¢ stamp commemorating the Pony Express, dispensed with purple entirely, appearing in a rust brown earth tone more suitable to the image of a horse and rider departing from a western rural post office. =Presidential Issue of 1938= Presidential issue of 1938 The famous Presidential Issue, known as \\"Prexies\\" for short, came out in 1938. The series featured all 29 U.S. presidents through Calvin Coolidge, each of whom appeared in profile as a small sculptural bust. Values of 50¬¢ and lower were mono- colored; on the $1, $2, and $5 stamps the presidents' images were printed in black on white, surrounded by colored lettering and ornamentation. Up through the 22¬¢ Cleveland stamp, the denomination assigned to each president corresponds to his position in the presidential roster: thus the first president, Washington, is on the 1¬¢ value, the seventeenth, Andrew Johnson, is on the 17¬¢ value, etc. Additional stamps depict Franklin (¬Ω¬¢), Martha Washington (1¬Ω¬¢), and the White House (4¬Ω¬¢). Many of the values were included merely to place the presidents in proper numerical order and did not necessarily correspond to a postal rate; and one of the (difficult) games for Prexie collectors is to find a cover with, for instance, a single 16¬¢ stamp that pays a combination of rate and fees valid during the Prexies' period of usage. Many such covers remain to be discovered; some sellers on eBay have been surprised to discover an ordinary-seeming cover bid up to several hundred dollars because it was one of the sought-after solo usages. The Presidential issue remained in distribution for many years. Not until 1954 did the Post Office begin replacing its values with the stamps of a new definitive issue, the Liberty series. Famous Americans Series of 1940 In 1940, the U.S. Post Office issued a set of 35 stamps, issued over the course of approximately ten months, commemorating America's famous Authors, Poets, Educators, Scientists, Composers, Artists and Inventors. The Educators included Booker T. Washington, who now became the first African-American to be honored on a U.S. stamp. This series of Postage issues was printed by the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. These stamps were larger in size than normal definitive issues, with only 280 stamp images contained on the printing plate (400 images was standard for the Presidential series). Notable also is the red-violet color chosen for the 3¬¢ stamps, a brighter hue than the traditional purple.

B. Morse - Cyrus Hall McCormick - Elias Howe - Alexander Graham Bell World War II Scott # 905 During World War II, production of new U. S. 3¬¢ commemorative stamps all but ceased. Among the three issues that appeared in 1942 was the celebrated Win the War stamp, which enjoyed enormously wide use, owing partly to patriotism and partly to the relative unavailability of alternatives. It presents an art deco eagle posed in a \\"V\\" shape for victory surrounded by 13 stars. The eagle is grasping arrows, but has no olive branch. A notable commemorative set did, indeed, appear in 1943‚Äì44, but its stamps, all valued at 5 cents, were not competitive with the Win the War issue. This was the Overrun Countries series (known to collectors as the Flag set), produced as a tribute to the thirteen nations that had been occupied by the Axis Powers. The thirteen stamps present full color images of the national flags of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Norway, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Austria, Denmark, and Korea, with the names of the respective countries written beneath. To the left of each flag appears the image of the phoenix, which symbolizes the renewal of life, and to its right appears a kneeling female figure with arms raised, breaking the shackles of servitude. Overrun Countries stamps The stamps with flags of European countries were released at intervals from June to December 1943, while the Korea flag stamp was released in November 1944.The Postal Service Guide to U.S. Stamps, 27th edition, 2000 (), p. 128. These stamps were priced at 5 cents, although the standard cost for a first class stamp was 3 cents. These stamps were intended for use on V-mail, a means whereby mail intended for military personnel overseas was delivered with certainty. The service persons overseas used the same method for writing letters home, and the same process was used to reconstruct their letters, except that their postage was free. The two-cent surcharge on the V-mail letters helped pay for the additional expense of this method of delivery. Because of the elaborate process necessary for the full-color printing, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing contracted with a private firm, the American Bank Note Company, to produce the series - the first U. S. stamps to be printed by a private company since 1893. Uniquely among U. S. issues, the sheets lack the plate numbers usually printed on the selvage surrounding the stamps. In the places where the numbers normally appear on each sheet, the name of the country is substituted, engraved in capital letters. Post-World War II The post-World War II stamp program followed a consistent pattern for many years: a steady stream of commemorative issues sold as single stamps at the first-class letter rate. While the majority of these were designed in the double-width format, an appreciable number issued in honor of individuals conformed instead to the format, size, general design style and red-violet hue used in the 1940 Famous Americans series. George W. Carver, 1948 The Postal Service had become increasingly lax about employing purple for 3¬¢ stamps, and after the war, departures from that color in double-width commemoratives veritably became the rule rather than the exception (although U. P. U. colors and purple for 3¬¢ stamps would continue to be used in the definitive issues of the next decades). Beginning in 1948, Congressional Representatives and Senators began to push the Post Office for stamps proposed by constituents, leading to a relative flood of stamps honoring obscure persons and organizations. Stamp issue did not again become well regulated until the formation of the Citizens' Stamp Advisory Committee (CSAC) in 1957. 5¬¢ George Washington Regular Issue, 1962 The Liberty issue of 1954, deep in the Cold War, took a much more political slant than previous issues. The common first-class stamp was a 3¬¢ Statue of Liberty in purple, and included the inscription \\"In God We Trust\\", the first explicit religious reference on a U.S. stamp (ten days before the issue of the 3¬¢ Liberty stamp, the words \\"under God\\" had been inserted into the Pledge of Allegiance). The Statue of Liberty appeared on two additional higher values as well, 8¬¢ and 11¬¢, both of which were printed in two colors. The other stamps in the series included liberty-related statesmen and landmarks, such as Patrick Henry and Bunker Hill, although other subjects, (Benjamin Harrison, for example) seem unrelated to the basic theme. Gustaf Mannerheim, 1961 In 1957, the American Flag was featured on a U. S. stamp for the first time. The Post Office had long avoided this image, fearing accusations that, in issuing stamps on which they would be defacing the flag by cancellation marks, they would be both committing and fomenting desecration. However, protests against this initial flag issue were muted, and the flag has remained a perennially popular U. S. stamp subject ever since. The 3¬¢ rate for first-class had been unchanged since 1932, but by 1958 there were no more efficiency gains to keep the lid on prices, and the rate went to 4¬¢, beginning a steady series of rate increases that reached 49¬¢ as of January 26, 2014. The Prominent Americans series superseded the \\"Liberties\\" in the 1960s and proved the last definitive issue to conform to the Universal Postal Union color code. In the 1970s, they were replaced by the Americana series, in which colors became purely a matter of designer preference. 1973 \\"Love\\" stamp In 1971, the Post Office was reorganized in accordance with the Postal Reorganization Act of 1970, becoming the United States Postal Service (USPS). (2) (3) However, it is still heavily regulated, with, for instance, the CSAC continuing to decide which commemorative stamps to issue. In January 1973, the USPS began to issue \\"Love\\" stamps for use on Valentine's Day and other special occasions such as weddings, birthdays, anniversaries and letters to loved ones. The first such issue was an 8 cents stamp that the Postal Service initially titled \\"Special Stamp for Someone Special\\". The stamp was based on a pop art image that Robert Indiana had designed during the 1960s (see \\"Love\\" sculpture).(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) The 1973 issue had a printing production of 320 million stamps. Air Mail 1918 6c was the same design as the notable 24-cent Inverted Jenny variety of this series Airmail in the United States Post Office emerged in three stages beginning with the 'pioneer period'Scott's US Stamp Catalog, Air Post Stamps where there were many unofficial flights carrying the mail prior to 1918, the year the US Post Office assumed delivery of all Air Mail. The US Post office began contracting out to the private sector to carry the mail (Contract Air Mail, CAM) on February 15, 1926. In 1934, all US Air Mail was carried by the U.S. Army for six months, after which the contract system resumed. Abraham Lincoln postage issues In 1866, about a year after Abraham Lincoln's assassination, the U.S. Post Office issued its first postage stamp honoring the fallen President. The Post Office stated that the release took place on June 17. Some sources, however, believe that the stamp was introduced on April 14, the one-year anniversary of Lincoln's death, and one notable expert made an (unverifiable) claim that the stamp first saw use on April 15. In any case, it is considered by some as America's first commemorative stamp. From that point on Lincoln's portrait appeared on a variety of U.S. postage stamps and today exists on more than a dozen issues. Lincoln is also honored on commemorative stamps issued by Costa Rica and Nicaragua. With the exceptions of George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, Lincoln appears on US Postage more than any other famous American. File:Abraham Lincoln 1866 Issue-15c.jpgThe 1st Lincoln postage stamp issue of 1866 File:Abraham Lincoln 1890 Issue-4c.jpgIssue of 1890 File:Abraham Lincoln 1903 Issue-5c.jpgIssue of 1903 File:Lincoln 1938 Issue-16c.jpgIssue of 1938 Modern U.S. stamps The first self-adhesive stamp was a 10 cent stamp from the Christmas issue of 1974. It was not considered successful, and the surviving stamps, though not rare, are all gradually becoming discolored due to the adhesive used. Self-adhesives were not issued again until 1989, gradually becoming so popular that , only a handful of types are offered with the traditional gum (now affectionately called \\"manual stamps\\" by postal employees). The increasing frequency of postal rate increases from the 1970s on, and the necessity to wait for these to be approved by Congress, made it problematic for the Postal Service to provide stamps matching the increased costs in a timely manner. Until it was known, for example, whether the new first-class rate would be 16c or, instead, 15c, no denominated stamp could be printed. The Postal Service found a way to bypass this problem in 1978. Preparatory to that year's increase, an orange colored stamp with a simple eagle design appeared bearing the denomination \\"A\\" instead of a number; and the public was informed that this stamp would satisfy the new first-class rate, whatever it turned out to be. Subsequent rate increases resulted in B, C and D stamps, which bore the same eagle design but were printed, respectively, in purple, buff-brown and blue-green. When it came time for an E stamp in 1987, the Postal Service commissioned a more elaborate design: a color picture of the globe as seen from space (E for Earth). Rises since have prompted F for Flower, G for Old Glory and H for Hat stamps, all appropriately illustrated. The F stamp in 1991 was accompanied by an undenominated \\"make-up\\" stamp with no pictorial design beyond a frame, which enclosed the words \\"This U. S. stamp, along with 25c of additional U. S. postage, is equivalent to the 'F' stamp rate.\\" The Great Americans series and the Transportation coils began appearing in 1980 and 1981, respectively. The transportation coils were used steadily for some 20 years, while Great Americans was replaced by the Distinguished Americans series, which began in 2000. The increasing use of email and other technologies during the 1990s led to a decline in the amount of first-class mail, while bulk mail increased. A large variety of commemorative stamps continue to appear, but more of them just go to collectors, while the stamps of the average person's daily mail are non- denominated types issued specifically for businesses. The first US postage stamp to incorporate microprinting as a security feature was the American Wildflower Series introduced by The United States Postal Service in 1992. It was also the first commemorative stamp to be wholly produced by offset lithography. The USPS has since issued other stamps with more complex microprinting incorporated along with dates, words, and abbreviations such as USPS and even entire stamp designs composed of microprint letters. In 2005, after 111 years of producing American postage stamps, the Bureau of Engraving and Printing ended its involvement with the postal service. On April 12, 2007, the Forever stamp went on sale for 41 cents, and is good for mailing one-ounce First-Class letters anytime in the future‚Äîregardless of price changes. In 2011, the Post Office began issuing all new stamps for First-Class postage‚Äîboth definitives and commemoratives‚Äîas Forever stamps: denominations were no longer included on them. Beginning in 2015, the Post Office made all other stamps Forever stamps-Postcard, Additional Ounce, Two Ounce, Three Ounce, and Non-Machinable Surcharge, and these types of stamps now have their use printed on them instead of a number. On February 25, 2010, the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled 2-1 that Frank Gaylord, sculptor of a portion of the Korean War Veterans Memorial, was entitled to compensation when an image of that sculpture was used on a 37 cent postage stamp because he had not signed away his intellectual property rights to the sculpture when it was erected. The appeals court rejected arguments that the photo was transformative. In 2006 sculptor Frank Gaylord enlisted Fish & Richardson to make a pro bono claim that the Postal Service had violated his Intellectual property rights to the sculpture and thus should have been compensated. The Postal Service argued that Gaylord was not the sole sculptor (saying he had received advice from federal sources‚Äîwho recommended that the uniforms appear more in the wind) and also that the sculpture was actually architecture. Gaylord won all of his arguments in the lower court except for one: the court ruled the photo was fair use and thus he was not entitled to compensation. Gaylord appealed and won the case on appeal. In 2011, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord $5,000. On appeal, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit vacated the order and remanded the case back to the US Court of Federal Claims and in September 2013, the US Court of Federal Claims awarded Gaylord more than $600,000 in damages.US Court of Federal Claims award Later in the 2010s, automated stamp and bank automatic teller machines began dispensing thinner stamps. The thin stamps were to make it easier for automated stamp machines to dispense and to make the stamps more environmentally friendly. On January 26, 2014, the postal service raised the price of First-class postage stamps to 49 cents. Rates for other mail, including postcards and packages, also increased. Starting in 2005, the USPS offered customers the ability to design and purchase custom stamps, which were offered through third-party providers, like Stamps.com and Zazzle. The USPS prohibited certain types of images (such as alcohol, tobacco, gambling, weapons, controlled substances, political content, religious content, violent content, or sexual content) from being used on the custom stamps. The rules generated some controversy by uneven enforcement of the rules against the use of purportedly religious and political imagery. This eventually lead to two lawsuits, Zukerman v. United States Postal Serv. and Fletcher v. United States Postal Serv. On June 9, 2020 the District of Columbia Circuit ruled in Zukerman v. United States Postal Serv. that the content rules didn't meet the \\"objective, workable standards\\" test established in Minnesota Voters Alliance v. Mansky. One week later, the USPS discontinued the custom stamp program. =New stamps= Twelve criteria for new stamps and postal stationery include that \\"events of historical significance shall be considered for commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years.\\" For many years, these included the restriction that \\"no postal item will be issued sooner than five years after the individual's death,\\" with an exception provided for stamps memorializing recently deceased U.S. Presidents. In September 2011, however, the postal service announced that, in an attempt to increase flagging revenues, stamps would soon offer images of celebrated living persons, chosen by the Committee in response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and social networks on the Internet. The revised criterion reads: \\"The Postal Service will honor living men and women who have made extraordinary contributions to American society and culture.\\" On June 14, 2008, in Washington, DC, the Postal Service issued the first set of 10 designs in the 42‚Äìcent Flags of Our Nation stamps. The stamps were designed by Howard E. Paine of Delaplane, Virginia. Five subsequent sets of ten stamps each had appeared by August 16, 2012, bringing the total of stamp designs to sixty. Sets nos. 3 and 4 were denominated 44-cents, while the final two sets appeared as Forever stamps. In August 2014, former Postmaster General Benjamin F. Bailar complained that the USPS was \\"prostituting\\" its stamps by focusing on stamps centered on popular culture, not cultural icons. He claims that this is a move aimed at making up for the USPS' revenue shortage at the expense of the values of the stamp program.

The corpus callosum is only found in placental mammals. It spans part of the longitudinal fissure, connecting the left and right cerebral hemispheres, enabling communication between them. It is the largest white matter structure in the human brain, about ten centimetres in length and consisting of 200-300 million axonal projections. A number of separate nerve tracts, classed as subregions of the corpus callosum, connect different parts of the hemispheres. The main ones are known as the genu, the rostrum, the trunk or body, and the splenium. Structure MRI of corpus callosum and its named parts Corpus callosum The corpus callosum forms the floor of the longitudinal fissure that separates the two cerebral hemispheres. Part of the corpus callosum forms the roof of the lateral ventricles. The corpus callosum has four main parts; individual nerve tracts that connect different parts of the hemispheres. These are the rostrum, the genu, the trunk or body, and the splenium. A narrowed part between the trunk and the splenium is known as the isthmus. Fibres from the trunk and the splenium known together as the tapetum form the roof of each lateral ventricle. The front part of the corpus callosum, towards the frontal lobes is called the genu (\\"knee\\"). The genu curves downward and backward in front of the septum pellucidum, diminishing greatly in thickness. The lower much thinner part is the rostrum and is connected below with the lamina terminalis, which stretches from the interventricular foramina to the recess at the base of the optic stalk. The rostrum is named for its resemblance to a bird's beak. The end part of the corpus callosum, towards the cerebellum, is called the splenium. This is the thickest part, and overlaps the tela choroidea of the third ventricle and the midbrain, and ends in a thick, convex, free border. Splenium translates as bandage in Greek. The trunk of the corpus callosum lies between the splenium and the genu. The callosal sulcus separates the corpus callosum from the cingulate gyrus. = Relations = On either side of the corpus callosum, the fibers radiate in the white matter and pass to the various parts of the cerebral cortex; those curving forward from the genu into the frontal lobes constitute the forceps minor (also forceps anterior) and those curving backward from the splenium into the occipital lobes, the forceps major (also forceps posterior). Between these two parts is the main body of the fibers which constitute the tapetum and extend laterally on either side into the temporal lobe, and cover in the central part of the lateral ventricle. The tapetum and anterior commissure share the function of connecting left and right temporal lobes. The anterior cerebral arteries are in contact with the under surface of the rostrum, they arch over the front of the genu and are carried along the trunk, supplying the front four-fifths of the corpus callosum. = Neuronal fibers = right The size, amount of myelination, and density of the fibers in the subregions relate to the functions of the brain regions they connect. Myelination is the process of coating neurons with myelin, which helps the transfer of information between neurons. The process is believed to occur until an individual's thirties with peak growth in the first decade of one‚Äôs life. Thinner, lightly myelinated fibers are slower conducting and they connect the association and prefrontal areas. Thicker and fast-conducting fibers connect the visual and motor areas. The tractogram pictured, shows the nerve tracts from six segments of the corpus callosum, providing linking of the cortical regions between the cerebral hemispheres. Those of the genu are shown in coral, of the premotor ‚Äì green, of the sensory-motor ‚Äì purple, of the parietal ‚Äì pink, of the temporal ‚Äì yellow, and of the splenium ‚Äì blue. Thinner axons in the genu connect the prefrontal cortex between the two halves of the brain; these fibers arise from a fork-like bundle of fibers from the tapetum, the forceps minor. Thicker axons in the trunk of the corpus callosum, interconnect areas of the motor cortex, with proportionately more of the corpus callosum dedicated to supplementary motor regions including Broca's area. The splenium, communicates somatosensory information between the two halves of the parietal lobe and the visual cortex at the occipital lobe, these are the fibers of the forceps major. In a study of five- to eighteen-year-olds there was found to be a positive correlation between age and callosal thickness. = Variation between sexes = The corpus callosum and its relation to sex has been a subject of debate in the scientific and lay communities for over a century. Initial research in the early 20th century claimed the corpus to be different in size between men and women. That research was in turn questioned, and ultimately gave way to more advanced imaging techniques that appeared to refute earlier correlations. However, advanced analytical techniques of computational neuroanatomy developed in the 1990s showed that sex differences were clear but confined to certain parts of the corpus callosum, and that they correlated with cognitive performance in certain tests. An MRI study found that the midsagittal corpus callosum cross-sectional area is, after controlling for brain size, on average, proportionately larger in females. Using diffusion tensor sequences on MRI machines, the rate at which molecules diffuse in and out of a specific area of tissue, anisotropy can be measured and used as an indirect measurement of anatomical connection strength. These sequences have found consistent sex differences in human corpus callosal shape and microstructure. Analysis by shape and size has also been used to study specific three-dimensional mathematical relationships with MRIs, and have found consistent and statistically significant differences across sexes. Specific algorithms have found significant differences between the two sexes in over 70% of cases in one review.  Correlates of size with handedness  One study reported that the front portion of the human corpus callosum was 0.75 cm2 or 11% larger in left-handed and ambidextrous people than right- handed people. This difference was evident in the anterior and posterior regions of the corpus callosum, but not in the splenium. However, this has been challenged and others have instead suggested that the degree of handedness negatively correlates with the size of the corpus callosum, meaning that individuals who are capable of using both hands with dexterity would have the largest corpus callosum and vice versa for either left or right hand. Clinical significance =Epilepsy= Electroencephalography is used to find the source of electrical activity causing a seizure as part of the surgical evaluation for a corpus callosotomy. The symptoms of refractory (difficult to treat) epilepsy can be reduced by cutting through the corpus callosum in an operation known as a corpus callosotomy. This is usually reserved for cases in which complex or grand mal seizures are produced by an epileptogenic focus on one side of the brain, causing an interhemispheric electrical storm. The diagnostic work up for this procedure involves an electroencephalogram, MRI, PET scan, and evaluation by a specialized neurologist, neurosurgeon, psychiatrist, and neuroradiologist before surgery can be considered. =Failure to develop= The formation of the corpus callosum begins with the first midline crossing of pioneer axons around week 12 in the prenatal development of the human, or day 15 in the embryogenesis of the mouse. Agenesis of the corpus callosum (ACC) is a rare congenital disorder that is one of the most common brain malformations observed in human beings, in which the corpus callosum is partially or completely absent. ACC is usually diagnosed within the first two years of life, and may manifest as a severe syndrome in infancy or childhood, as a milder condition in young adults, or as an asymptomatic incidental finding. Initial symptoms of ACC usually include seizures, which may be followed by feeding problems and delays in holding the head erect, sitting, standing, and walking. Other possible symptoms may include impairments in mental and physical development, hand-eye coordination, and visual and auditory memory. Hydrocephaly may also occur. In mild cases, symptoms such as seizures, repetitive speech, or headaches may not appear for years. Some syndromes that are often associated with ACC are Aicardi syndrome, Andermann syndrome, Shapiro syndrome, and acrocallosal syndrome. ACC is usually not fatal. Treatment usually involves management of symptoms, such as hydrocephaly and seizures, if they occur. Although many children with the disorder lead normal lives and have average intelligence, careful neuropsychological testing reveals subtle differences in higher cortical function compared to individuals of the same age and education without ACC. Children with ACC accompanied by developmental delay and/or seizure disorders should be screened for metabolic disorders. In addition to agenesis of the corpus callosum, similar conditions are hypogenesis (partial formation), dysgenesis (malformation), and hypoplasia (underdevelopment, including too thin). Other studies have also linked possible correlations between corpus callosum malformation and autism spectrum disorders. Kim Peek, a savant and the inspiration behind the movie Rain Man, was found with agenesis of the corpus callosum, as part of FG syndrome. =Other disease= Anterior corpus callosum lesions may result in akinetic mutism or anomic aphasia. See also: *Alien hand syndrome *Dyslexia without agraphia (seen with damage to splenium of corpus callosum) *Marchiafava‚ÄìBignami disease a degenerative disease characterised by loss of myelin and necrosis of the corpus callosum *Multiple sclerosis with the Dawson's fingers sign *Reversible splenial lesion syndrome ‚Äì a rare encephalopathy of unknown origin with a transient lesion in the splenium, mostly associated with infectious diseases *Septo-optic dysplasia (de Morsier syndrome) *Split-brain *Susac's syndrome characterised by lesions as small holes in the corpus callosum History The first study of the corpus with relation to gender was by R. B. Bean, a Philadelphia anatomist, who suggested in 1906 that \\"exceptional size of the corpus callosum may mean exceptional intellectual activity\\" and that there were measurable differences between men and women. Perhaps reflecting the political climate of the times, he went on to claim differences in the size of the callosum across different races. His research was ultimately refuted by Franklin Mall, the director of his own laboratory. Of more mainstream impact was a 1982 Science article by Holloway and Utamsing that suggested sex difference in human brain morphology, which related to differences in cognitive ability. Time published an article in 1992 that suggested that, because the corpus is \\"often wider in the brains of women than in those of men, it may allow for greater cross-talk between the hemispheres--possibly the basis for women‚Äôs intuition.\\" As cited by Bishop and Wahlsten. Later publications in the psychology literature have raised doubt as to whether the anatomic size of the corpus is actually different. A meta- analysis of 49 studies since 1980 found that, contrary to de Lacoste-Utamsing and Holloway, no sex difference could be found in the size of the corpus callosum, whether or not account was taken of larger male brain size. A study in 2006 using thin slice MRI showed no difference in thickness of the corpus when accounting for the size of the subject. Other animals The corpus callosum is found only in placental mammals, while it is absent in monotremes and marsupials, as well as other vertebrates such as birds, reptiles, amphibians and fish.Sarnat, Harvey B., and Paolo Curatolo (2007). Malformations of the Nervous System: Handbook of Clinical Neurology, p. 68 (Other groups do have other brain structures that allow for communication between the two hemispheres, such as the anterior commissure, which serves as the primary mode of interhemispheric communication in marsupials,Ashwell, Ken (2010). The Neurobiology of Australian Marsupials: Brain Evolution in the Other Mammalian Radiation, p. 50Armati, Patricia J., Chris R. Dickman, and Ian D. Hume (2006). Marsupials, p. 175 and which carries all the commissural fibers arising from the neocortex (also known as the neopallium), whereas in placental mammals, the anterior commissure carries only some of these fibers.Butler, Ann B., and William Hodos (2005). Comparative Vertebrate Neuroanatomy: Evolution and Adaptation, p. 361) In primates, the speed of nerve transmission depends on its degree of myelination, or lipid coating. This is reflected by the diameter of the nerve axon. In most primates, axonal diameter increases in proportion to brain size to compensate for the increased distance to travel for neural impulse transmission. This allows the brain to coordinate sensory and motor impulses. However, the scaling of overall brain size and increased myelination have not occurred between chimpanzees and humans. This has resulted in the human corpus callosum's requiring double the time for interhemispheric communication as a macaque's.

Francesco Maria Guazzo, aka Guaccio, aka Guaccius (1570 Francesco Maria Guazzo, Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani - Volume 60 (2003)‚Äì16??) was an Italian priest. Is most well known for the writing the Compendium Maleficarum (Book of Witches). He was a member of one of the oldest of the Catholic Ambrosian orders. These religious brotherhoods had appeared at various times since the 14th Century in and around the city of Milan and were quite plentiful, but the only one to attain more than simply local importance was the ‚ÄòFratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus‚Äô sometimes known as 'The Brethren of the Grove'. Before 1441 there were various monasteries that were canonically recognized under the name ‚ÄòFratres Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus‚Äô but there was little link between them. However, in 1441 Pope Eugene IV merged them into one congregation called ‚ÄòCongregatio Sancti Ambrosii ad Nemus‚Äô of which Francesco Maria Guazzo was a member under the papacy of Pope Sixtus V and Pope Paul V. Guazzo had firsthand experience of the practice and profession of witchcraft and bewitchment and was widely travelled and highly regarded in the field of possessions and demonology and the cures thereof. During his life he is credited with performing several exorcisms including to members of several ducal and princely families, notably the bewitched Cardinal Charles of Lorraine and his relative, Eric, Bishop of Verdun. On another occasion Guazzo was called to D√ºsseldorf in order to exorcise the mad John William, Duke of J√ºlich-Cleves-Berg (1562‚Äì1609). Guazzo first diagnosed possession, but after five months of unsuccessful attempts at spiritual healing and in the summer of 1604, the diagnosis was changed to bewitchment as the cause of the poor Duke‚Äôs mental illness. Guazzo had been sent to D√ºsseldorf by Duke Charles III of Lorraine (a family with which he had a long running association, having exorcised the Cardinal, Charles of Lorraine) on behalf of his daughter Antoinette (1569‚Äì1610), Duke Johann Wilhelm‚Äôs wife. It was these direct experiences that inspired Guazzo to write his Compendium Maleficarum which was published in 1608 and was widely regarded among his contemporaries as the authoritative manuscript on Witchcraft. Within his text, Guazzo discusses witches‚Äô pacts with the devil, detailed descriptions of witches‚Äô powers and poisons and also prepared his classification of the demons based on a previous work by Michael Psellus. In this work, Guazzo was greatly influenced by Duke Charles III of Lorraine‚Äôs leading lawyer and demonologist, Nicholas Remy (Remy produced one of the most important early works on demonology and witchcraft in 1595, Daemonolatreiae libri tres, and claimed to have sentenced to death over 900 people during witch trials between 1582‚Äì1592).

Origin  According to one legend, the shedim are descendants of serpents, or of demons in the form of serpents, alluding to the serpent in Eden as related in Genesis. According to one common view, they are the offsprings of Lilith, from her union with Adam or other men. Another legend said that God had started making them, intending for them to be humans, but did not complete their creation because He was resting during the Sabbath. Even after the Sabbath, He left them how they were to show that when the Sabbath comes, all work must be viewed as complete.Maureen Bloom. Jewish Mysticism and Magic: An Anthropological Perspective.

Supposedly, sinful people sacrificed their daughters to the shedim, but it is unclear if the sacrifice consisted in the murdering of the victims or in the sexual satisfaction of the demons. There are many things that one is admonished not to do in order to avoid invoking shedim, such as whistling or even saying the word \\"shedim\\". Judah ben Samuel of Regensburg wrote in his will and testament that one should not seal up windows completely because it traps shedim in the house. The shedim are not always seen as malicious creatures and are also considered to be helpful to humans. They are said to be even able to live according to the Torah, like Asmodeus.Raphael Patai Encyclopedia of Jewish Folklore and Traditions Routledge 2015  Appearance  Shedim are said to have had the feet and claws of a rooster.Marc Carlson, Notes on a demonic pantheon To see if the shedim were present in some place, ashes were thrown to the ground or floor, and then their footsteps became visible. Shedim can shapeshift and assume a human form. The talmud tells of Asmodeus assuming King Solomon's form and ruling in his place for some time. However, he was never seen barefoot because he could not disguise his feet. In the Zohar: > The Shekhinah hid Esther from Ahasuerus and gave him a Shedah instead while > she returned to Mordechai's arms. [...] This is why a man must speak with > his wife before he mates with her, because she might have been exchanged > with a female demon.

Analytical solutions without a theory An empirical relationship is supported by confirmatory data irrespective of theoretical basis such as first principles. Sometimes theoretical explanations for what were initially empirical relationships are found, in which case the relationships are no longer considered empirical. An example was the Rydberg formula to predict the wavelengths of hydrogen spectral lines. Proposed in 1876, it perfectly predicted the wavelengths of the Lyman series, but lacked a theoretical basis until Niels Bohr produced his Bohr model of the atom in 1925.McMullin, Ernan (1968), ‚ÄúWhat Do Physical Models Tell Us?‚Äù, in B. van Rootselaar and J.

On occasion, what was thought to be an empirical factor is later deemed to be a fundamental physical constant. Approximations Some empirical relationships are merely approximations, often equivalent to the first few terms of the Taylor series of the analytical solution describing the phenomenon. Other relationships only hold under certain specific conditions, reducing them to special cases of more general relationship. Some approximations, in particular phenomenological models, may even contradict theory; they are employed because they are more mathematically tractable than some theories, and are able to yield results.

Early life  Cunningham was born in Wimbledon, Surrey, England, the son of Allan Cunningham (head gardener at Wimbledon Park House), who came from Renfrewshire, Scotland, and his English wife Sarah (n√©e Juson/Jewson n√©e Dicken). Allan Cunningham was educated at a Putney private school, Reverend John Adams Academy and then went into a solicitor's office (a Lincoln's Inn Conveyancer). He afterwards obtained a position with William Townsend Aiton superintendent of Kew Gardens, and this brought him in touch with Robert Brown and Sir Joseph Banks.  Brazil and Australia (New South Wales) On Banks' recommendation, Cunningham went to Brazil with James Bowie between 1814 and 1816 collecting specimens for Kew Gardens. On 28 September 1816 he sailed for Sydney where he arrived on 20 December 1816. He established himself at Parramatta. Among other explorations, he joined John Oxley's 1817 expedition beyond the Blue Mountains to the Lachlan and Macquarie rivers and shared in the privations of the 1,200 miles (1,930 km) journey. He collected specimens of about 450 species and gained valuable experience as an explorer.  Coastal exploration  Cunningham traveled as the ship's botanist aboard HMS Mermaid under Phillip Parker King from 1817 to 1820. The Mermaid was of only 85 tons, but sailing on 22 December 1817 they reached King George Sound on 21 January 1818. Though their stay was short many specimens were found but the islands on the west coast were comparatively barren. Towards the end of March the Goulburn Islands on the north coast were reached and many new plants were discovered. They reached Timor on 4 June 1818 and, turning for home, arrived at Port Jackson on 29 July 1818. Cunningham's collections during this voyage included about 300 species. Shortly after his return, Cunningham made an excursion south from Sydney, ascending the prominent peak of Mount Keira overlooking the Illawarra region and present day Wollongong. Towards the end of the year he made a voyage to Tasmania arriving at Hobart on 2 January 1819. He next visited Launceston and though often finding the botany interesting, he found little that was absolutely new, as Brown had preceded him. In May he went with King in the Mermaid on a second voyage to the north and north-west coasts. On this occasion they started up the east coast and Cunningham found many opportunities for adding to his collections. One of these was after the ship reached the mouth of the Endeavour River (the site of modern Cooktown) on 28 June 1819. The circumnavigation of Australia was completed on 27 August when they reached Vernon Island in Clarence Strait. They again visited Timor and arrived back in Sydney on 12 January 1820. The third voyage to the north coast with King began on 15 June, but meeting bad weather the bowsprit was lost and a return was made for repairs. Sailing again on 13 July 1820 the northerly course was followed and eventually the continent was circumnavigated. Though they found the little vessel was in a bad state when they were on the north-west coast, and though serious danger was escaped until they were close to home, they were nearly wrecked off Botany Bay. The Mermaid was then condemned and the next voyage was on the Bathurst which was twice the size of the Mermaid. They left on 26 May 1821, the northern route was chosen, and when they were on the west coast of Australia it was found necessary to go to Mauritius to refit, where they arrived on 27 September 1821. They left after a stay of seven weeks and reached King George Sound on 24 December 1821. A sufficiently long stay was made for Cunningham to make an excellent collection of plants, and then turning on their tracks the Bathurst sailed up the west coast and round the north of Australia. Sydney was reached again on 25 April 1822. Cunningham provided a chapter on botany to King's Narrative of a Survey.  Further exploration of eastern Australia  Memorial to Allan Cunningham's \\"discovery\\" of Cunningham's Gap, Cunningham Highway, QLD In September 1822 Cunningham went on an expedition over the Blue Mountains and arrived at Bathurst on 14 October 1822 and returned to Parramatta in January 1823. His account of about 100 plants met with will be found in Geographical Memoirs on New South Wales, edited by Barron Field, 1825, under the title \\"A Specimen of the Indigenous Botany ... between Port Jackson and Bathurst\\". In 1823 Cunningham set out from the upper Hunter River to explore inside the Great Dividing Range. With five men and five horses, he set out from Bathurst to explore from the Cudgegong River, passing through Rylstone to Coolah and then eastwards to Scone and returning to Coolah through Merriwa. He examined the Cudgegong and Goulburn Rivers. On 2 June passing through Coolah to the north east, he explored Pandora's Pass, which could have opened out a fair and practicable road to Liverpool Plains. He returned to Bathurst through an undeveloped Mudgee on 27 June 1823. In September 1824 Cunningham accompanied John Oxley on his second expedition to Moreton Bay and explored up the Brisbane River. Cunningham also undertook an expedition to what is now Canberra in 1824. He travelled with three convicts, three horses and a cart and he travelled via Lake Bathurst, Captains Flat and the valley in which flows the Queanbeyan River. Poor weather prevented him from continuing his journey south.Exploring the ACT and Southeast New South Wales, J. Kay McDonald, Kangaroo Press, Sydney, 1985 Cunningham had long wished to visit New Zealand and on 28 August 1826 he was able to sail on a whaler. He was hospitably received by the missionaries in the Bay of Islands, was able to do much botanical work, and returned to Sydney on 20 January 1827. Accounts of his work in New Zealand will be found in Hooker's Companion to the Botanical Magazine, 1836, and Annals of Natural History, 1838 and 1839. Cunningham set out to explore the area to the west of Moreton Bay in 1827, crossing to the west of the Great Dividing Range from the Hunter Region and travelling north. In June 1827, Cunningham climbed to the top of Mount Dumaresq (near what is now Clintonvale close to Maryvale) and after wrote in his diary that this lush area was ideal for settlement. Exploring around Mount Dumaresq, Cunningham found a pass, now known as Cunninghams Gap. Cunningham returned to the Moreton Bay penal colony in 1828, setting off from Brisbane with Patrick Logan, Charles Fraser and five men to find Mount Warning and to establish the route to Cunningham's Gap which he did, on 24 July. The peaks on either side of the gap were also named, Mount Cordeaux and Mount Mitchell. After exploring the McPherson Range area, Cunningham travelled on the south side of the Gap whereas the highway today runs further north, through the gap, from the small township of Aratula. Spicer's Gap which runs parallel to Cunningham's Gap was actually the pass first identified by Cunningham in 1827. After its rediscovery by Henry Alphen in 1847, Spicer's Gap was used as a stagecoach route. In 1829, Cunningham explored the Brisbane River.  Contributions to botany  Australia's most prolific plant collector of the early nineteenth century, Cunningham had been sent to Australia to expand the collection at the King' Garden at Kew and he was given the title of \\"King's Collector for the Royal Garden at Kew\\". He was so successful that a hothouse built for specimens from Africa was renamed \\"Botany Bay House\\". Although his main role was to collect propagation material, his lasting legacy are his herbarium sheets which are thought by his biographer, Anthony Orchard, to exceed 20,000. It is often thought that Cunningham published few papers on botany and in his obituary, John Lindley wrote, \\"How little he regarded posthumous fame is seen by the fewness of his published works, a brief sketch of the Flora of New Zealand being the only systematic account of his Botanical discoveries...\\". In fact, although he was effectively barred from publishing on botany whilst employed as \\"King's Collector\\", he nevertheless later published seven major papers, and 57 shorter papers on subjects including taxonomy, geology, physical geography and zoology. He was one of the first scientists to publish papers on botanical geography. Cunningham was concerned that many of his discoveries sent to Kew were not published, allowing others, including William Baxter to be credited with their discovery. (Baxter had risked arrest and a possible flogging for undermining Cunningham's work by sending specimens to commercial interests.) When Cunningham returned to London, he sent duplicates of his herbarium specimens to other botanists, including de Candolle, Schauer, William Jackson Hooker, Bentham, Lindley and others, who published his descriptions with acknowledgement to \\"A.Cunn.\\".  Later life  In 1831, Cunningham returned to England, but went back to Australia in 1837 on board as government botanist, resigning the following year on finding that he was required to grow vegetables for government officials. On 27 June 1839, he died of consumption in Sydney, and was buried in the Devonshire Street Cemetery. In 1901, his remains were \\"reverently removed\\" and re-interred in an obelisk within the Royal Botanic Gardens in Sydney.  Legacy  Cunningham memorial obelisk in the Royal Botanic Garden, Sydney Some of Australia's plants: Araucaria cunninghamii (hoop pine), Archontophoenix cunninghamiana (Bangalow palm), Banksia cunninghamii, Lysiphyllum cunninghamii (jigal), Casuarina cunninghamiana (river sheoak), Centipeda cunninghamii (old man weed), Ficus cunninghamii, Medicosma cunninghamii (bone wood), Nothofagus cunninghamii (myrtle tree, Tasmania), Pennantia cunninghamii (brown beech), and Polyosma cunninghamii (rainforest featherwood) commemorate Allan and his brother Richard, a botanist.Allan Cunningham 1791‚Äì1839 Retrieved on 27-1-2009 The Cunningham Highway is named in honour of Allan. The genus Alania was created by Endlicher in Cunningham's honour.CRC World Dictionary of Plant Names Robert Brown named the conifer genus Cunninghamia after both Allan Cunningham and Dr. James Cunningham, a British doctor who introduced the trees into cultivation in 1702.

Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. xiii + 296 pp. . (\\"Cunningham\\", p. 63). The Australian federal seat of Cunningham, which stretches from Port Kembla in the south of Wollongong to Heathcote in Southern Sydney, was named after him in honour of his being the first European explorer to visit the Illawarra region. The locality of Allan, Queensland was named after him.

Formal verification can be helpful in proving the correctness of systems such as: cryptographic protocols, combinational circuits, digital circuits with internal memory, and software expressed as source code. The verification of these systems is done by providing a formal proof on an abstract mathematical model of the system, the correspondence between the mathematical model and the nature of the system being otherwise known by construction. Examples of mathematical objects often used to model systems are: finite state machines, labelled transition systems, Petri nets, vector addition systems, timed automata, hybrid automata, process algebra, formal semantics of programming languages such as operational semantics, denotational semantics, axiomatic semantics and Hoare logic.Introduction to Formal Verification, Berkeley University of California, Retrieved November 6, 2013  Approaches  One approach and formation is model checking, which consists of a systematically exhaustive exploration of the mathematical model (this is possible for finite models, but also for some infinite models where infinite sets of states can be effectively represented finitely by using abstraction or taking advantage of symmetry). Usually this consists of exploring all states and transitions in the model, by using smart and domain- specific abstraction techniques to consider whole groups of states in a single operation and reduce computing time. Implementation techniques include state space enumeration, symbolic state space enumeration, abstract interpretation, symbolic simulation, abstraction refinement. The properties to be verified are often described in temporal logics, such as linear temporal logic (LTL), Property Specification Language (PSL), SystemVerilog Assertions (SVA), or computational tree logic (CTL). The great advantage of model checking is that it is often fully automatic; its primary disadvantage is that it does not in general scale to large systems; symbolic models are typically limited to a few hundred bits of state, while explicit state enumeration requires the state space being explored to be relatively small. Another approach is deductive verification. It consists of generating from the system and its specifications (and possibly other annotations) a collection of mathematical proof obligations, the truth of which imply conformance of the system to its specification, and discharging these obligations using either proof assistants (interactive theorem provers) (such as HOL, ACL2, Isabelle, Coq or PVS), automatic theorem provers, including in particular satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers. This approach has the disadvantage that it typically requires the user to understand in detail why the system works correctly, and to convey this information to the verification system, either in the form of a sequence of theorems to be proved or in the form of specifications (invariants, preconditions, postconditions) of system components (e.g. functions or procedures) and perhaps subcomponents (such as loops or data structures). = Software = Formal verification of software programs involves proving that a program satisfies a formal specification of its behavior. Subareas of formal verification include deductive verification (see above), abstract interpretation, automated theorem proving, type systems, and lightweight formal methods. A promising type-based verification approach is dependently typed programming, in which the types of functions include (at least part of) those functions' specifications, and type-checking the code establishes its correctness against those specifications. Fully featured dependently typed languages support deductive verification as a special case. Another complementary approach is program derivation, in which efficient code is produced from functional specifications by a series of correctness- preserving steps. An example of this approach is the Bird‚ÄìMeertens formalism, and this approach can be seen as another form of correctness by construction. These techniques can be sound, meaning that the verified properties can be logically deduced from the semantics, or unsound, meaning that there is no such guarantee. A sound technique yields a result only once it has searched the entire space of possibilities. An example of an unsound technique is one that searches only a subset of the possibilities, for instance only integers up to a certain number, and give a \\"good-enough\\" result. Techniques can also be decidable, meaning that their algorithmic implementations are guaranteed to terminate with an answer, or undecidable, meaning that they may never terminate. Because they are bounded, unsound techniques are often more likely to be decidable than sound ones.  Verification and validation  Verification is one aspect of testing a product's fitness for purpose. Validation is the complementary aspect. Often one refers to the overall checking process as V & V. * Validation: \\"Are we trying to make the right thing?\\", i.e., is the product specified to the user's actual needs? * Verification: \\"Have we made what we were trying to make?\\", i.e., does the product conform to the specifications? The verification process consists of static/structural and dynamic/behavioral aspects. E.g., for a software product one can inspect the source code (static) and run against specific test cases (dynamic). Validation usually can be done only dynamically, i.e., the product is tested by putting it through typical and atypical usages (\\"Does it satisfactorily meet all use cases?\\").  Automated program repair  Program repair is performed with respect to an oracle, encompassing the desired functionality of the program which is used for validation of the generated fix. A simple example is a test-suite‚Äîthe input/output pairs specify the functionality of the program. A variety of techniques are employed, most notably using satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, and genetic programming, using evolutionary computing to generate and evaluate possible candidates for fixes. The former method is deterministic, while the latter is randomized. Program repair combines techniques from formal verification and program synthesis. Fault-localization techniques in formal verification are used to compute program points which might be possible bug-locations, which can be targeted by the synthesis modules. Repair systems often focus on a small pre-defined class of bugs in order to reduce the search space. Industrial use is limited owing to the computational cost of existing techniques.  Industry use  The growth in complexity of designs increases the importance of formal verification techniques in the hardware industry.Formal verification of a real-time hardware design. Portal.acm.org (June 27, 1983). Retrieved on April 30, 2011. At present, formal verification is used by most or all leading hardware companies, but its use in the software industry is still languishing. This could be attributed to the greater need in the hardware industry, where errors have greater commercial significance. Because of the potential subtle interactions between components, it is increasingly difficult to exercise a realistic set of possibilities by simulation. Important aspects of hardware design are amenable to automated proof methods, making formal verification easier to introduce and more productive. , several operating systems have been formally verified: NICTA's Secure Embedded L4 microkernel, sold commercially as seL4 by OK Labs; OSEK/VDX based real-time operating system ORIENTAIS by East China Normal University; Green Hills Software's Integrity operating system; and SYSGO's PikeOS.Christoph Baumann, Bernhard Beckert, Holger Blasum, and Thorsten Bormer Ingredients of Operating System Correctness? Lessons Learned in the Formal Verification of PikeOS \\"Getting it Right\\" by Jack Ganssle As of 2016, Yale and Columbia professors Zhong Shao and Ronghui Gu developed a formal verification protocol for blockchain called CertiKOS. The program is the first example of formal verification in the blockchain world, and an example of formal verification being used explicitly as a security program. As of 2017, formal verification has been applied to the design of large computer networks through a mathematical model of the network, and as part of a new network technology category, intent-based networking. Network software vendors that offer formal verification solutions include Cisco Forward Networks and Veriflow Systems. The CompCert C compiler is a formally verified C compiler implementing the majority of ISO C.

Early life Darcy was born in Dijon, France, on June 10, 1803. His first given name is Henry; although the French spelling Henri appears in multiple sources such as necrological notices, Darcy used the Anglicized spelling. Despite his father's death in 1817 when he was 14, his mother was able to borrow money to pay for his tutors. In 1821 he enrolled at the √âcole Polytechnique (Polytechnic School) in Paris, and transferred two years later to the School of Bridges and Roads, which led to employment in the Corps of Bridges and Roads. Darcy met an English woman, Henriette Carey, whose family had been living in Dijon, and married her in 1828. Engineering career Darcy's bust in the Jardin Darcy, Dijon As a member of the Corps, he built an impressive pressurized water distribution system in Dijon following the failure of attempts to supply adequate fresh water by drilling wells. The system carried water from Rosoir Spring away through a covered aqueduct (watercourse) to reservoirs near the city, which then fed into a network of 28,000 meters of pressurized pipes delivering water to much of the city. The system was fully closed and driven by gravity, and thus required no pumps with just sand acting as a filter. He was also involved in many other public works in and around Dijon, as well as in the politics of the Dijon city government. During this period he modified the Prony equation for calculating head loss due to friction, which after further modification by Julius Weisbach would become the well-known Darcy‚ÄìWeisbach equation still in use today. In 1848 he became Chief Engineer for the d√©partement of which Dijon is the capital. Soon thereafter he left Dijon due to political pressure, but was promoted to Chief Director for Water and Pavements and took up office in Paris. While in that position, he was able to focus more on his hydraulics research, especially on flow and friction losses in pipes. During this period he improved the design of the Pitot tube, into essentially the form used today. He resigned his post in 1855 due to poor health, but was permitted to continue his research in Dijon. In 1855 and 1856 he conducted column experiments that established what has become known as Darcy's law; initially developed to describe flow through sands, it has since been generalized to a variety of situations and is in widespread use today. The unit of measure of material permeability, the darcy is named in his honour. Darcy died of pneumonia while on a trip to Paris in 1858, and is buried in Cimeti√®re de Dijon (formerly known as P√©joces) in Dijon.

Wendover's Flores Historiarum  The first Flores Historiarum was created by St Albans writer, Roger of Wendover, who carried his chronology from the creation up to 1235, the year before his death. Roger claims in his preface to have selected \\"from the books of catholic writers worthy of credit, just as flowers of various colours are gathered from various fields.\\" Hence he also called his work Flores Historiarum. However, like most chronicles, it is now valued not so much for what was culled from previous writers, as for its full and lively narrative of contemporary events from 1215 to 1235,Volume I, Chapter IX, Section 19 of The Cambridge History of English and American Literature including the signing of Magna Carta by King John at Runnymede. The book has survived in one thirteenth-century manuscript in the Bodleian Library (Douce manuscript 207), a mutilated 14th-century copy in the British Library (Cotton manuscript Otho B. v.), and in the version adapted by Matthew Paris which forms the first part of his Chronica Majora (ed. Henry Richards Luard, Rolls Series, seven volumes). The sources brought together in the Flores include Bede, Geoffrey of Monmouth, Sigebert of Gembloux, Florence of Worcester, Simeon of Durham, William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, Robert de Monte, William of Tyre, Ralph de Diceto, Benedictus Abbas, Roger of Hoveden and Ralph of Coggeshall (to 1194).Frederic Madden (1866), Historia Anglorum, vol 3, xxiiiF. M. Powicke (1906), Roger of Wendover and the Coggeshall Chronicle, The English Historical Review, 21 (82), pp. 286-296 A detailed list is given by Luard,Henry Richards Luard (1872, 1874) Matthei Parisiensis Chronica Majora, vol 1 p. xxxiv (to 1066) and vol. 2 p. xiii (to 1216) who in his running text also marks up the apparent source of each section. From 1201 and through the reign of King John it draws on a source common between it and the Annales Sancti Edmundi later also used by John de Taxster, and also some annals added to the St. Albans copy of Diceto.Vaughan (1958), Matthew Paris, p. 24 The date of creation of the earliest nucleus of the compilation has been disputed. The manuscript in the Bodleian Library, written out ca. 1300, contains a marginal note against the annal for 1188 that reads \\"up to here in Abbot John's chronicle book\\".\\"hic usque in lib. cronic. Johannis abbatis\\". Luard took this to mean that there had existed a core of the Flores going up to 1188, the creation of which had been supervised by John of Wallingford at some point during his tenure as abbot of St Albans between 1195 and 1214.Luard (1874, 1880), Chronica Majora, vol 2 pp.x-xii and vol 7 pp ix-xi On the other hand, 1188 is also when the first manuscript of Matthew Paris's Chronica Majora concludes, with the end of the reign of Henry II, so an alternative view is that this may have been the chronicle book referred to, which may have been in the possession of a later Abbot John at the turn of the 14th century when the manuscript was written out.Madden (1866), Historia Anglorum, vol 1, p lxxi; also Powicke (1944), Compilation of the Chronica Majora, Proc. Brit. Acad. 30, 148‚Äì9, and Galbraith, Roger Wendover and Matthew Paris, p. 16 and note 1. Both cited by Vaughan (1958), Matthew Paris, p. 23 Considering the text itself, some of the earlier parts of the work draw heavily on the Historia scholastica (ca. 1173) of Petrus Comestor, a copy of which was not introduced into the monastery until John of Wallingford's abbacy.Luard (1872), Chronica Majora, vol 1 p. xxxii; British Library, Royal MS 4 D VII (illustrated catalogue) (Though Luard elsewhere notes some differences between the treatment of Comestor and that of some other writers).Luard (1872), Chronica Majora, vol 1 p. xli The work of Diceto, which is used throughout the Flores but especially after 1066, was also not copied for the Abbey until 1204.Felix Liebermann (1888), in Monumenta Germaniae Historica SS 28 pp.7-8, cited in Vaughan, Matthew Paris, p.22; British Library, Royal MS 13 E VI (Illustrated catalogue) In its final form the annal for 1179 contains a reference to the Lateran Council of 1215,Frederic Madden (1866), Historia Anglorum, vol 3, xxiii and Vaughan finds that all of the extant manuscripts ultimately descend from a common ancestral exemplar that can be no earlier than 1228.Vaughan, Matthew Paris, p.28 However, Vaughan does not rule out the possibility that there might have been some earlier compilation used by Wendover,Vaughan, Matthew Paris, p.23 and finds some evidence for such a compilation, extending perhaps to 1066.Vaughan, Matthew Paris, pp.96‚Äì97  Paris's Flores Historiarum, and its continuation  The second and more widely distributed Flores Historiarum runs from the creation to 1326 (although some of the earlier manuscripts end at 1306). It was compiled by various persons and quickly acquired contemporary popularity, for it was continued by many hands in many manuscript traditions. Among twentyAccording to Reginald L. Poole, reviewing Luard's 1890 edition in The English Historical Review 7 (January 1892):146-150) p. 148. surviving manuscripts are those compiled at St Benet Holme, Norfolk, continued at Tintern Abbey (Royal Mss 14.c.6); at Norwich (Cottonian Claudius E 8); Rochester (Cottonian Nero D 2); St Paul's, London (Lambeth Mss 1106); St Mary's, Southwark (Bodleian Library, Rawlinson Mss B 177); and at St Augustine's, Canterbury (Harleian Mss 641).According to Luard. It was written originally at St Albans Abbey and later at Westminster Abbey. The earliest manuscript, the basis for all the various continuations, is conserved in Chetham's Library, Manchester. This manuscript was carried down to 1265, with brief notes and emendations in the hand of Matthew Paris. A continuation carried the chronicle down to 1306; the continuation from 1306 to 1325/26 was compiled at Westminster by Robert of Reading (d. 1325) and another Westminster monk. The second Flores Historiarum was for many years attributed to a \\"Matthew of Westminster\\" who Henry Richards Luard demonstrated was actually Matthew Paris. The Flores Historiarum is markedly opposed to Robert the Bruce. According to the chronicle after Bruce had had himself crowned king of Scots in the spring of 1306, Lady Elisabeth Bruce tells her husband: \\"I reckon that you are a summer king; perhaps you won't be a winter one\\".John McKinnell Meeting the Other in Norse Myth and Legend 1843840421-p 69 2005 \\"According to the Flores Historiarum, these were the words of Lady Elisabeth Bruce to her husband Robert after he had had himself crowned king of Scots in the spring of 1306, as part of his campaign to wrest control of ... ... The implication is of a battle between the 'kings' of Summer and Winter43 in which the 'Summer King' is killed, and also that his consort is hostile to him. We have already seen both features in. 19 Ed. Ill, 130; for other 'summer kings', see E. K. Chambers...

It is also a secondary site of androgen synthesis. ‚Äì \\"Adrenal Gland\\" Layers The adrenal cortex comprises three main zones, or layers that are regulated by distinct hormones as noted below. This anatomic zonation can be appreciated at the microscopic level, where each zone can be recognized and distinguished from one another based on structural and anatomic characteristics. ;Zona glomerulosa :The outermost layer, the zona glomerulosa is the main site for the production of aldosterone, a mineralocorticoid. The synthesis and secretion of aldosterone are mainly regulated by the renin‚Äìangiotensin‚Äìaldosterone system. The zona glomerulosa cells express a specific enzyme aldosterone synthase (also known as CYP11B2). Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure.Marieb Human Anatomy & Physiology 9th edition, chapter:16, page:629, question number:14 Aldosterone's effects are on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. :The secretion of aldosterone is also stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). :The expression of neuron-specific proteins in the zona glomerulosa cells of human adrenocortical tissues has been predicted and reported by several authors and it was suggested that the expression of proteins like the neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) in the cells of the zona glomerulosa reflects the regenerative feature of these cells, which would lose NCAM immunoreactivity after moving to the zona fasciculata. However, together with other data on neuroendocrine properties of zona glomerulosa cells, NCAM expression may reflect a neuroendocrine differentiation of these cells. ;Zona fasciculata :Situated between the glomerulosa and reticularis, the cells of the zona fasciculata synthesize and secrete glucocorticoids, such as 11-deoxycorticosterone, corticosterone, and cortisol in humans. The major hormone that stimulates cortisol secretion in humans is the ACTH that is released from the anterior pituitary. It has been shown that the steroidogenic capacity of the zona fasciculata increases during illness in infants. ;Zona reticularis :The inner most cortical layer, the zona reticularis produces androgens, mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. The secretion of DHEAS is also stimulated by ACTH. Hormone synthesis Adrenal steroid pathways The precursor of steroids synthesized in the adrenal cortex is cholesterol that is stored in vesicles. Cholesterol can be synthesized de novo in the adrenal cortex. Yet, the major source of cholesterol appears to be cholesterol that is taken up with circulating lipoproteins. The steps up to this point occur in many steroid-producing tissues. Subsequent steps to generate aldosterone and cortisol, however, primarily occur in the adrenal cortex: * Progesterone ‚Üí (hydroxylation at C21) ‚Üí 11-Deoxycorticosterone ‚Üí (two further hydroxylations at C11 and C18) ‚Üí Aldosterone * Progesterone ‚Üí (hydroxylation at C17) ‚Üí 17-alpha-hydroxyprogesterone ‚Üí (hydroxylation at C21) ‚Üí 11-Deoxycortisol ‚Üí (hydroxylation at C11) ‚Üí Cortisol Adrenal steroid hormone synthesis steps Production The adrenal cortex produces a number of different corticosteroid hormones. =Mineralocorticoids= The primary mineralocorticoid, aldosterone, is produced in the adrenocortical zona glomerulosa by the action of the enzyme aldosterone synthase (also known as CYP11B2). Aldosterone is largely responsible for the long-term regulation of blood pressure. Aldosterone effects on the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct of the kidney where it causes increased reabsorption of sodium and increased excretion of both potassium (by principal cells) and hydrogen ions (by intercalated cells of the collecting duct). Sodium retention is also a response of the distal colon, and sweat glands to aldosterone receptor stimulation. Although sustained production of aldosterone requires persistent calcium entry through low-voltage activated Ca2+ channels, isolated zona glomerulosa cells are considered nonexcitable, with recorded membrane voltages that are too hyperpolarized to permit Ca2+ channels entry. =Glucocorticoids= Glucocorticoids are produced in the zona fasciculata. The primary glucocorticoid released by the adrenal gland is cortisol in humans and corticosterone in many other animals. Its secretion is regulated by the hormone ACTH from the anterior pituitary. =Androgens= They are produced in the zona reticularis. The most important androgens include: *Testosterone: a hormone with a wide variety of effects, ranging from enhancing muscle mass and stimulation of cell growth to the development of the secondary sex characteristics. *Dihydrotestosterone (DHT): a metabolite of testosterone, and a more potent androgen than testosterone in that it binds more strongly to androgen receptors. *Androstenedione (Andro): an androgenic steroid produced by the testes, adrenal cortex, and ovaries. While androstenediones are converted metabolically to testosterone and other androgens, they are also the parent structure of estrone. *Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): It is the primary precursor of natural estrogens. DHEA is also called dehydroisoandrosterone or dehydroandrosterone. The reticularis also produces DHEA-sulfate due to the actions of a sulfotransferase, SULT2A1.

Operational semantics are classified in two categories: structural operational semantics (or small-step semantics) formally describe how the individual steps of a computation take place in a computer-based system; by opposition natural semantics (or big-step semantics) describe how the overall results of the executions are obtained. Other approaches to providing a formal semantics of programming languages include axiomatic semantics and denotational semantics. The operational semantics for a programming language describes how a valid program is interpreted as sequences of computational steps. These sequences then are the meaning of the program. In the context of functional programs, the final step in a terminating sequence returns the value of the program. (In general there can be many return values for a single program, because the program could be nondeterministic, and even for a deterministic program there can be many computation sequences since the semantics may not specify exactly what sequence of operations arrives at that value.) Perhaps the first formal incarnation of operational semantics was the use of the lambda calculus to define the semantics of LISP. Abstract machines in the tradition of the SECD machine are also closely related.  History  The concept of operational semantics was used for the first time in defining the semantics of Algol 68. The following statement is a quote from the revised ALGOL 68 report: > The meaning of a program in the strict language is explained in terms of a > hypothetical computer which performs the set of actions which constitute the > elaboration of that program. (Algol68, Section 2) The first use of the term \\"operational semantics\\" in its present meaning is attributed to Dana Scott (Plotkin04). What follows is a quote from Scott's seminal paper on formal semantics, in which he mentions the \\"operational\\" aspects of semantics. > It is all very well to aim for a more ‚Äòabstract‚Äô and a ‚Äòcleaner‚Äô approach to > semantics, but if the plan is to be any good, the operational aspects cannot > be completely ignored. (Scott70)  Approaches  Gordon Plotkin introduced the structural operational semantics, Robert Hieb and Matthias Felleisen the reduction contexts, and Gilles Kahn the natural semantics. = Small-step semantics =  Structural operational semantics  Structural operational semantics (also called structured operational semantics or small-step semantics) was introduced by Gordon Plotkin in (Plotkin81) as a logical means to define operational semantics. The basic idea behind SOS is to define the behavior of a program in terms of the behavior of its parts, thus providing a structural, i.e., syntax-oriented and inductive, view on operational semantics. An SOS specification defines the behavior of a program in terms of a (set of) transition relation(s). SOS specifications take the form of a set of inference rules that define the valid transitions of a composite piece of syntax in terms of the transitions of its components. For a simple example, we consider part of the semantics of a simple programming language; proper illustrations are given in Plotkin81 and Hennessy90, and other textbooks. Let C_1, C_2 range over programs of the language, and let s range over states (e.g. functions from memory locations to values). If we have expressions (ranged over by E), values and locations (L), then a memory update command would have semantics: \\\\frac{\\\\langle E,s\\\\rangle \\\\Rightarrow V}{\\\\langle L:=E\\\\,,\\\\,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow (s\\\\uplus (L\\\\mapsto V))} Informally, the rule says that \\"if the expression E in state s reduces to value V, then the program L:=E will update the state s with the assignment L=V\\". The semantics of sequencing can be given by the following three rules: \\\\frac{\\\\langle C_1,s\\\\rangle \\\\longrightarrow s'} {\\\\langle C_1;C_2 \\\\,,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow \\\\langle C_2, s'\\\\rangle} \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\langle C_1,s\\\\rangle \\\\longrightarrow \\\\langle C_1',s'\\\\rangle} {\\\\langle C_1;C_2 \\\\,,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow \\\\langle C_1';C_2\\\\,, s'\\\\rangle} \\\\quad\\\\quad \\\\frac{} {\\\\langle \\\\mathbf{skip} ,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow s} Informally, the first rule says that, if program C_1 in state s finishes in state s', then the program C_1;C_2 in state s will reduce to the program C_2 in state s'. (You can think of this as formalizing \\"You can run C_1, and then run C_2 using the resulting memory store.) The second rule says that if the program C_1 in state s can reduce to the program C_1' with state s', then the program C_1;C_2 in state s will reduce to the program C_1';C_2 in state s'. (You can think of this as formalizing the principle for an optimizing compiler: \\"You are allowed to transform C_1 as if it were stand-alone, even if it is just the first part of a program.\\") The semantics is structural, because the meaning of the sequential program C_1;C_2, is defined by the meaning of C_1 and the meaning of C_2. If we also have Boolean expressions over the state, ranged over by B, then we can define the semantics of the while command: \\\\frac{\\\\langle B,s\\\\rangle \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{true}}{\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{while}\\\\ B\\\\ \\\\mathbf{ do }\\\\ C,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow \\\\langle C;\\\\mathbf{while}\\\\ B\\\\ \\\\mathbf{do}\\\\ C,s\\\\rangle} \\\\quad \\\\frac{\\\\langle B,s\\\\rangle \\\\Rightarrow \\\\mathbf{false}}{\\\\langle\\\\mathbf{while}\\\\ B\\\\ \\\\mathbf{ do }\\\\ C,s\\\\rangle\\\\longrightarrow s} Such a definition allows formal analysis of the behavior of programs, permitting the study of relations between programs. Important relations include simulation preorders and bisimulation. These are especially useful in the context of concurrency theory. Thanks to its intuitive look and easy-to-follow structure, SOS has gained great popularity and has become a de facto standard in defining operational semantics. As a sign of success, the original report (so-called Aarhus report) on SOS (Plotkin81) has attracted more than 1000 citations according to the CiteSeer , making it one of the most cited technical reports in Computer Science.  Reduction semantics  Reduction semantics are an alternative presentation of operational semantics using so-called reduction contexts. The method was introduced by Robert Hieb and Matthias Felleisen in 1992 as a technique for formalizing an equational theory for control and state. For example, the grammar of a simple call-by-value lambda calculus and its contexts can be given as: e = v \\\\;\\\\; (e\\\\; e) \\\\;\\\\; x \\\\quad\\\\quad v = \\\\lambda x.e \\\\quad\\\\quad C = \\\\left[\\\\,\\\\right] \\\\;\\\\; (C\\\\; e) \\\\;\\\\; (v\\\\; C) The contexts C include a hole \\\\left[\\\\,\\\\right] where a term can be plugged in. The shape of the contexts indicate where reduction can occur (i.e., a term can be plugged into a term). To describe a semantics for this language, axioms or reduction rules are provided: (\\\\lambda x.e)\\\\; v \\\\longrightarrow e\\\\,\\\\left[x / v\\\\right] \\\\quad (\\\\mathrm{\\\\beta}) This single axiom is the beta rule from the lambda calculus. The reduction contexts show how this rule composes with more complicated terms. In particular, this rule can trigger for the argument position of an application like ((\\\\lambda x.x \\\\; \\\\lambda x.x) \\\\lambda x.(x\\\\;x)) because there is a context ([\\\\,]\\\\; \\\\lambda x.(x\\\\;x)) that matches the term. In this case, the contexts uniquely decompose terms so that only one reduction is possible at any given step. Extending the axiom to match the reduction contexts gives the compatible closure. Taking the reflexive, transitive closure of this relation gives the reduction relation for this language. The technique is useful for the ease in which reduction contexts can model state or control constructs (e.g., continuations). In addition, reduction semantics have been used to model object-oriented languages, contract systems, and other language features. = Big-step semantics =  Natural semantics  Big-step structural operational semantics is also known under the names natural semantics, relational semantics and evaluation semantics.University of Illinois CS422 Big-step operational semantics was introduced under the name natural semantics by Gilles Kahn when presenting Mini-ML, a pure dialect of the ML language. One can view big-step definitions as definitions of functions, or more generally of relations, interpreting each language construct in an appropriate domain. Its intuitiveness makes it a popular choice for semantics specification in programming languages, but it has some drawbacks that make it inconvenient or impossible to use in many situations, such as languages with control-intensive features or concurrency. A big-step semantics describes in a divide-and-conquer manner how final evaluation results of language constructs can be obtained by combining the evaluation results of their syntactic counterparts (subexpressions, substatements, etc.).  Comparison  There are a number of distinctions between small-step and big-step semantics that influence whether one or the other forms a more suitable basis for specifying the semantics of a programming language. Big- step semantics have the advantage of often being simpler (needing fewer inference rules) and often directly correspond to an efficient implementation of an interpreter for the language (hence Kahn calling them \\"natural\\".) Both can lead to simpler proofs, for example when proving the preservation of correctness under some program transformation.Xavier Leroy. \\"Coinductive big- step operational semantics\\". The main disadvantage of big-step semantics is that non-terminating (diverging) computations do not have an inference tree, making it impossible to state and prove properties about such computations. Small-step semantics give more control of the details and order of evaluation. In the case of instrumented operational semantics, this allows the operational semantics to track and the semanticist to state and prove more accurate theorems about the run-time behaviour of the language. These properties make small-step semantics more convenient when proving type soundness of a type system against an operational semantics.

A proximity card controlled turnstile A passive proximity card with the plastic casing opened to show components: antenna coil and integrated circuit (black object bottom center) Anatomy of proximity card: coil and IC The proximity card coil of an electronic fare collection system A proximity card or prox card is a contactless smart card which can be read without inserting it into a reader device, as required by earlier magnetic stripe cards such as credit cards and contact type smart cards. The proximity cards are part of the contactless card technologies. Held near an electronic reader for a moment they enable the identification of an encoded number. The reader usually produces a beep or other sound to indicate the card has been read. The term \\"proximity card\\" refers to the older 125 kHz devices as distinct from the newer 13.56 MHz contactless smartcards. Second generation prox cards are used for mass and distance reading applications. Proximity cards typically have a read range of up to 50 cm (< 15 inches) which is the main difference from the contactless smartcard with a range of 2 to 10 cm (1 to 3 inches). The card can often be left in a wallet or purseAccess Control Card Handling Guide https://www.supercircuits.com/media/docs/proxcard_handling_guide_en.pdf , and read by simply holding the wallet or purse near the reader. These early proximity cards can't hold more data than a magnetic stripe card, and only cards with smart chips (ie, contactless smartcards) can hold other types of data like electronic funds balance for contactless payment systems, history data for time and attendance or biometric templates. When used without encoding data, only with the card serial number, contactless smartcards have similar functionalities to proximity cards.  Types  = Passive cards = Passive 125 kHz cards, the more widely used type which were described above, are powered by radio frequency signals from the reader device and so have a limited range and must be held close to the reader unit. They are used as keycards for access control doors in office buildings. A version with more memory, contactless smartcards, are used for other applications: library cards, contactless payment systems, and public transit fare cards. = Active cards = Active 125 kHz prox cards, sometimes called vicinity cards, are powered by an internal lithium battery. They can have a greater range, up to 2 meters (6 ft). Other contactless technologies like UHF (Ultra High Frequency) smart cards can reach up to 150 meters (500 ft) and are often used for applications where the card is read inside a vehicle, such as security gates which open when a vehicle with the access card inside approaches, or automated toll collection. The battery eventually runs down, however, and the card must be replaced after 2 to 7 years.  Method of operation  The card and the reader unit communicate with each other through 125 kHz radio frequency fields (13.56 MHz for the contactless smartcard cards) by a process called resonant energy transfer. Passive cards have three components which are sealed inside the plastic: an antenna consisting of a coil of wire, a capacitor, and an integrated circuit (IC) which contains the user's ID number in specific formats and no other data. The reader has its own antenna, which continuously transmits a short range radio frequency field. When the card is placed within range of the reader, the antenna coil and capacitor, which form a tuned circuit, absorb and store energy from the field, resonating at the frequency emitted by the reader. This energy is rectified to direct current which powers the integrated circuit. The chip sends its ID number or other data to the antenna coil, which transmits it by radio frequency signals back to the reader unit. The reader checks whether the ID number from the card is correct, and then performs whatever function it has been programmed to do for that ID number. All the energy to power the card comes from the reader unit, so passive cards must be close to a reader to transmit their data. An active card contains a flat lithium cell in addition to the above components to power it. The integrated circuit contains a receiver which uses the battery's power to amplify the signal from the reader unit so it is stronger, allowing the card to detect the reader at a greater distance. The battery also powers a transmitter circuit in the chip which transmits a stronger return signal to cover the greater distance.  Standards for Proximity cards  Proximity cards are all proprietary. This is also the case of the memory-based first generation of contactless smartcards. This means that there is no compatibility between the readers of a specific brand and the cards of another brand. Contactless smartcards are covered by the ISO/IEC 14443 and/or the ISO/IEC 15693 OR ISO/IEC 18000 standards. These standards define two types of card (\\"A\\" and \\"B\\", each with different communications protocols) which typically have a range up to 10 cm (4 inches). The related ISO/IEC 15693 (vicinity card) standard typically works up to a longer range of 100 cm (39 inches). The reality is that ISO/IEC 14443 as well as ISO/IEC 15693 can only be fully implemented on microprocessor-based cards. The best way to check if a technology meets ISO standard is to ask the manufacturer if it can be emulated on other devices without any proprietary hardware.  125 kHz Readers and formats  The card readers communicate in various protocols, for example the Wiegand protocol that consists of a data 0 and a data 1 circuit (or binary or simple on/off (digital) type circuit). Other known protocols are mono directional Clock and Data or bidirectional OSDP (RS 485), RS 232 or UART. The earliest card formats were up to 64 bits long. As demand has increased, bit size has increased to continue to provide unique numbers. Often, the first several bits can be made identical; these are called facility or site codes. The idea is that company A has a facility code of xn and a card set of 0001 through 1000 and company B has a facility code of yn and a card set also of 0001 through 1000. For smartcards, a numbering system is internationally harmonized and allocated by Netherlands-based NEN (registration authority) according to ISO/IEC 6523 and ISO/IEC 15459 standards.

They are the result of extensive research by scientists to improve upon naturally occurring animal and plant fibers. In general, synthetic fibers are created by extruding fiber-forming materials through spinnerets, forming a fiber. These are called synthetic or artificial fibers. Synthetic fibers are created by a process known as polymerization, which involves combining monomers to make a long chain or polymer. The word polymer comes from a Greek prefix \\"poly\\" which means \\"many\\" and suffix \\"mer\\" which means \\"single units\\". (Note: each single unit of a polymer is called a monomer). There are two types of polymerization: linear polymerization and cross-linked polymerization.  Early experiments  Joseph Swan created the first synthetic fiber. The first fully synthetic fibre was glass. Joseph Swan invented one of the first artificial fibers in the early 1880s; today it would be called semisynthetic in precise usage. His fiber was drawn from a cellulose liquid, formed by chemically modifying the fiber contained in tree bark. The synthetic fiber produced through this process was chemically similar in its potential applications to the carbon filament Swan had developed for his incandescent light bulb, but Swan soon realized the potential of the fiber to revolutionise textile manufacturing. In 1885, he unveiled fabrics he had manufactured from his synthetic material at the International Inventions Exhibition in London. The next step was taken by Hilaire de Chardonnet, a French engineer and industrialist, who invented the first artificial silk, which he called \\"Chardonnet silk\\". In the late 1870s, Chardonnet was working with Louis Pasteur on a remedy to the epidemic that was destroying French silkworms. Failure to clean up a spill in the darkroom resulted in Chardonnet's discovery of nitrocellulose as a potential replacement for real silk. Realizing the value of such a discovery, Chardonnet began to develop his new product, which he displayed at the Paris Exhibition of 1889. Chardonnet's material was extremely flammable, and was subsequently replaced with other, more stable materials. Commercial products Nylon was first synthesized by Wallace Carothers at DuPont. The first successful process was developed in 1894 by English chemist Charles Frederick Cross, and his collaborators Edward John Bevan and Clayton Beadle. They named the fiber \\"viscose\\", because the reaction product of carbon disulfide and cellulose in basic conditions gave a highly viscous solution of xanthate. The first commercial viscose rayon was produced by the UK company Courtaulds in 1905. The name \\"rayon\\" was adopted in 1924, with \\"viscose\\" being used for the viscous organic liquid used to make both rayon and cellophane. A similar product known as cellulose acetate was discovered in 1865. Rayon and acetate are both artificial fibers, but not truly synthetic, being made from wood. Nylon, the first synthetic fiber in the \\"fully synthetic\\" sense of that term, was developed by Wallace Carothers, an American researcher at the chemical firm DuPont in the 1930s. It soon made its debut in the United States as a replacement for silk, just in time for the introduction of rationing during World War II. Its novel use as a material for women's stockings overshadowed more practical uses, such as a replacement for the silk in parachutes and other military uses like ropes. The first polyester fiber was patented in Britain in 1928 by the International General Electric company. It was also produced by British chemists working at the Calico Printers' Association, John Rex Whinfield and James Tennant Dickson,, in 1941. They produced and patented one of the first polyester fibers which they named Terylene, also known as Dacron, equal to or surpassing nylon in toughness and resilience.Frank Greenaway, ‚ÄòWhinfield, John Rex (1901‚Äì1966)‚Äô, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 20 June 2011 ICI and DuPont went on to produce their own versions of the fiber. The world production of synthetic fibers was 55.2 million tonnes in 2014.Man-Made Fibers Continue To Grow , Textile World Description Synthetic fibers are made from synthesized polymers of small molecules. The compounds that are used to make these fibers come from raw materials such as petroleum based chemicals or petrochemicals. These materials are polymerized into a chemical that bonds two adjacent carbon atoms. Differing chemical compounds are used to produce different types of synthetic fibers. Synthetic fibers account for about half of all fiber usage, with applications in every field of fiber and textile technology. Although many classes of fiber based on synthetic polymers have been evaluated as potentially valuable commercial products, four of them - nylon, polyester, acrylic and polyolefin - dominate the market. These four account for approximately 98 percent by volume of synthetic fiber production, with polyester alone accounting for around 60 per cent. Pros Synthetic fibers are more durable than most natural fibers and will readily pick-up different dyes. In addition, many synthetic fibers offer consumer-friendly functions such as stretching, waterproofing and stain resistance. Sunlight, moisture, and oils from human skin cause all fibers to break down and wear away. Natural fibers tend to be much more sensitive than synthetic blends. This is mainly because natural products are biodegradable. Natural fibers are susceptible to larval insect infestation; synthetic fibers are not a good food source for fabric-damaging insects. Compared to natural fibers, many synthetic fibers are more water resistant and stain resistant. Some are even specially enhanced to withstand damage from water or stains. Cons A device for spinning Viscose Rayon dating from 1901 Most of synthetic fibers' disadvantages are related to their low melting temperature: *The mono-fibers do not trap air pockets like cotton and provide poor insulation. *Synthetic fibers burn more rapidly than natural. * Prone to heat damage. *Melt relatively easily. * Prone to damage by hot washing. * More electrostatic charge is generated by rubbing than with natural fibers. * Not skin friendly, so it is uncomfortable for long wearing. *Non-biodegradable in comparison to natural fibers. *Most of the synthetic fibers absorb very little moisture so become sticky when the body sweats. *Synthetic fibers are a source of microplastic pollution from laundry machines. Common synthetic fibers Common synthetic fibers include: * Nylon (1931) * Modacrylic (1949) * Olefin (1949) * Acrylic (1950) * Polyester (1953) Specialty synthetic fibers include: * Rayon (1894) artificial silk * Vinyon (1939) * Saran (1941) * Spandex (1959) * Vinalon (1939) * Aramids (1961) - known as Nomex, Kevlar and Twaron * Modal (1960's) * Dyneema/Spectra (1979) * PBI (Polybenzimidazole fiber) (1983) * Sulfar (1983) * Lyocell (1992) (artificial, not synthetic) * PLA (2002) * M-5 (PIPD fiber) * Orlon * Zylon (PBO fiber) * Vectran (TLCP fiber) made from Vectra LCP polymer * Derclon used in manufacture of rugs Other synthetic materials used in fibers include: * Acrylonitrile rubber (1930) Modern fibers that are made from older artificial materials include: * Glass fiber (1938) is used for: ** industrial, automotive, and home insulation (glass wool) ** reinforcement of composite materials (glass-reinforced plastic, glass fiber reinforced concrete) ** specialty papers in battery separators and filtration * Metallic fiber (1946) is used for: ** adding metallic properties to clothing for the purpose of fashion (usually made with composite plastic and metal foils) ** elimination and prevention of static charge build-up ** conducting electricity to transmit information ** conduction of heat See also * Artificial turf * Elasterell * Rope * Delustrant  References   Further reading  * The original source of this article and much of the synthetic fiber articles (copied with permission) is Whole Earth magazine, No. 90, Summer 1997. www.wholeearth.com ","title":"Synthetic fiber"},{"id":"270091","text":"Bonyads ( \\"Foundation\\") are charitable trusts in Iran that play a major role in Iran's non-petroleum economy, controlling an estimated 20% of Iran's GDP,Molavi, Afshin, Soul of Iran, Norton, (2006), p.176 and channeling revenues to groups supporting the Islamic Republic.

The assets of many Iranians whose ideas or social positions ran contrary to the new Islamic government were also confiscated and given to the Bonyads without any compensation. Today, there are over 100 Bonyads,\\"Ahmadinejad's Achilles Heel: The Iranian Economy\\" by Dr. Abbas Bakhtiar and they are criticized for many of the same reasons as their predecessors. They form tax-exempt, government subsidized, consortiums receiving religious donations and answerable directly (and only) to the Supreme Leader of Iran. The Bonyads are involved in everything from vast soybean and cotton fields to hotels to soft drinks to auto-manufacturing to shipping lines. The most prominent, the Bonyad-e Mostazafen va Janbazan, (Foundation for the Oppressed and Disabled), for example, \\"controls 20% of the country's production of textiles, 40% of soft drinks, two-thirds of all glass products and a dominant share also in tiles, chemicals, tires, foodstuffs.\\"NHH Sam 2007, Destructive Competition Some economists argue that its chair, and not the Minister of Finance or president of the Central bank, is considered the most powerful economic post in Iran.Molavi, Afshin, The Soul of Iran, Norton, (2005), p.176 In addition to the very large national Bonyads, \\"almost every Iranian town has its own bonyad\\", affiliated with local mullahs.

In 1999 Mohammad Forouzandeh, a former defense minister, reported that 80% of Iran's Bonyad companies were losing money. Bonyad companies also compete with Iran's unprotected private sector, whose firms complain of the difficulty of competing with bonyad firms whose political connections provide government permits and subsidies which eliminate worries over the need to make a profit in many market sectors. These Bonyads, by their very presence, hamper healthy economic competition, efficient use of capital and other resources, and growth. =Unification of Iran's social security system= As charity organizations they are supposed to provide social services to the poor and the needy; however, \\"since there are over 100 of these organisations operating independently, the government doesn't know what, why, how and to whom this help and assistance is given.\\" Bonyads do not fall under Iran's General Accounting Law and, consequently, are not subject to financial audits.https://fpc.state.gov/documents/organization/107234.pdf Unaccountable to the Central Bank governor, the bonyads \\"jealously guard their books from prying eyes.\\"Molavi, Soul of Iran, (2005) p.176 Lack of proper oversight and control of these foundations has also hampered the government's efforts in creating a comprehensive, central and unified social security system in the country, undertaken since 2003.World bank: country brief Iran has 12 million people living below the poverty line, six million of whom are not supported by any foundation or organization.Tehran Times - Poverty in Iran So as to clearly distinguish its activities from the formal Social Security Organization (SSO), bonyads would have to be in charge of vocational training centers, rehabilitation centers, socioeconomic centers, all drug-related rehabilitation centers, cooperative banking (while financing these activities with the bonyads large commercial holdings, which then could be privatized). The SSO, on the other hand, could have sole responsibility for unemployment- insurance, professional-rehabilitation/training costs, retirement-pensions, disability funds, etc. Rather than charitable organizations, the bonyads have been described as \\"patronage-oriented holding companies that ensure the channeling of revenues to groups and milieus supporting the regime,\\" but don't help the poor as a class.Roy, Olivier, The Failure of Political Islam by Olivier Roy, translated by Carol Volk, Harvard University Press, 1994, p.139 Another complaint describes them as having kept to their charitable mission for the first decade of the Islamic Republic, but having \\"increasingly forsaken their social welfare functions for straightforward commercial activities\\" since the death of Imam Khomeini.Millionaire mullahs by Paul Klebnikov, July 7, 2003, The Iranian Originally printed in Forbes, accessed 15-May-2009 Local city and town bonyad have been accused of sometimes using extortionate techniques to draw the traditional Shia Islamic 20% khums donations from local business owners. =Seized assets= In certain well known instances, such as the confiscation of the properties and assets of the Boroumand family of Esfahan, the Islamic Revolutionary Court judge responsible for unjustly ordering the seizure and confiscation of that family's belongings was identified as a criminal, who was subsequently executed by the Islamic regime on charges of \\"corruption on earth\\", yet his confiscation ruling was let to stand. In the rare instances where courts have ordered the Bonyad Mostazafan to return the properties of individuals whose belongings were unjustly seized, the Bonyad Mostazafan has refused to do so, instead offering to remunerate those individuals at the prices prevalent at the time at which those assets were seized in 1979, effectively denying the legitimate owners over 30 years of lost income and compensating them at only a tiny fraction of the true value of their belongings.

(; 19 July 1688 ‚Äì 17 July 1766), was an Italian Jesuit brother and missionary in China, where he served as an artist at the imperial court of three emperors ‚Äì the Kangxi, Yongzheng and Qianlong emperors. He painted in a style that is a fusion of European and Chinese traditions. Early life Castiglione was born in Milan's San Marcellino district on 19 July 1688. He was educated at home with a private tutor, then a common practice among wealthy families. He also learned to paint under the guidance of a master. In 1707, he entered the Society of Jesus in Genoa aged 19. Although a Jesuit, he was never ordained as a priest, instead joining as a lay brother.  Works  One of the earliest known painting by Castiglione in China in a blend of Chinese and Western styles, 1723 =Paintings= In the late 17th century, a number of European Jesuit painters served in the Qing court of the Kangxi Emperor who was interested in employing European Jesuits trained in various fields, including painting. In the early 18th century, Jesuits in China made a request for a painter to be sent to the imperial court in Beijing. Castiglione was identified as a promising candidate and he accepted the post. In 1710, on the way to Lisbon, he passed through Coimbra where he stayed for several years to decorate the chapel of St. Francis Borgia in the Church of the novitiate, today the New Cathedral of Coimbra. He painted several panels in the chapel and a Circumcision of Jesus for the main altar of the same church. In August 1715, Castiglione arrived in Macau, China, and reached Beijing later in the year. He stayed at a Jesuit church called St Joseph Mission or Eastern Hall (Dong Tang) in Chinese. He was presented to the Kangxi Emperor who viewed his painting of a dog, another source said a bird was also painted on the spot on Kangxi's request. He was assigned a few disciples, but was placed to work as an artisan in the palace enameling workshop. The Empress Xiaoxianchun While in China, Castiglione took the name Lang Shining (ÈÉû‰∏ñÂØß). Castiglione adapted his Western painting style to Chinese themes and taste. His earliest surviving painting created in such style was from the first year of Yongzheng's reign in 1723. He was permitted to leave the enamel workshop by Yongzheng as it was affecting his eyesight. Although Castaglione was favored by Yongzheng who commissioned a number of works by him, Yongzheng's reign was a difficult period for the Jesuits as Christianity was suppressed and those missionaries not working for the emperor were expelled. His skill as an artist was appreciated by the Qianlong Emperor, and Castiglione served the Emperor for three decades and was granted increasingly higher official rank within the Qing court. He spent many years in the court painting various subjects, including the portraits of the emperor and empress. Qianlong showed particularly interest in paintings of tribute horses presented to Emperor on which Castiglione painted a series. In 1765, Castiglione and other Jesuit painters also created a series of \\"Battle Copper Prints\\" commissioned by the Emperor to commemorate his military campaigns. Small-scale copies of his paintings were shipped to Paris and rendered into engravings with etching before being returned to China. This series of sixteen prints by Castiglione (who contributed two) and his contemporaries Jean-Denis Attiret, Ignatius Sichelbart and Jean-Damasc√®ne Sallusti were created in this way. Castiglione died in Beijing in 17 July 1766. An obituary was personally penned by Qianlong, who also erected a special stone in Castiglione's memory. Ruins of a structure at the Old Summer Palace =Architecture= In addition to his skill as a painter, he was also in charge of designing the Western-Style Palaces in the imperial gardens of the Old Summer Palace with assistance from other Jesuits such as Jean-Denis Attiret. The project was initiated by Qianlong in 1747 in a garden once used by Yongzheng, with the construction of European styled palaces and gardens, aviaries, a maze, and perspective paintings organized as an outdoor theatrical stage, as well as fountains and waterworks designed by Michel Benoist. Castiglione also created trompe-l'≈ìil paintings on the walls of the palaces. The buildings, however, were destroyed in 1860 during the Second Opium War. Castiglione's architectural works were lost, although influences of his trompe-l'≈ìil murals survive in paintings on walls and ceilings which were executed by his assistant in Juanqinzhai in Qianlong Garden in the Forbidden City. Style and techniques Linear perspective painting by Castiglione. (The Old Summer Palace museum collection) Castiglione's style of painting is a unique blend of European and Chinese compositional sensibility, technique and themes. He adjusted the Western style he was trained in to suit Chinese taste; for example, strong shadows used in chiaroscuro techniques were unacceptable in portraiture as the Qianlong Emperor thought that shadows looked like dirt, therefore when Castiglione painted the Emperor, the intensity of the light was reduced so that there was no shadow on the face, and the features were distinct. Emperors also preferred to have their portraits painted full face with a frontal posture, the royal portraits are therefore usually painted in such a manner. The paintings were done on silk, and unlike Western painting where mistakes can be reworked, brushwork on silk is almost impossible to be removed, therefore requires careful and precise painting. The painting needed to be worked out in detail beforehand, which Castiglione did in a preparatory drawing on paper before he traced the design onto silk. An example is the most important early work by Castiglione, One Hundred Horses in a Landscape (ÁôæÈßøÂúñ), for which the preparatory drawings survive. It was painted in 1728 for the Yongzheng emperor. Some of the horses are in a 'flying gallop' pose, which had not been done before by European painters. The painting was executed using tempera on silk in the form of a Chinese handscroll of nearly eight meters in length. It was largely done in a European-style in accordance with the rules of perspective, and with a consistent light source. However, the dramatic chiaroscuro shading typical of Baroque paintings is reduced and there are only traces of shadow under the hooves of the horses. Castiglione was assisted in many of his paintings by a number of court painters. For example, in the painting Deer Hunting Patrol (Âì®ÈπøÂúñ, Shaolutu), he would be responsible for painting the portraits of the emperor and other officials on horseback. Other members of the hunting party, the trees and landscape however would be painted by other court painters in a Chinese style that is distinctly different from Castiglione's. Legacy Due to Castiglione's work Qing court paintings began to show a clear Western influence. Other European painters followed and a new school of painting was created that combined Chinese and Western methods. The influence of Western art on the Qing court paintings is particularly evident in the light, shade, perspective, as well as the priority given to recording contemporary events. In 2005, Castiglione became the subject of the television series Palace Artist in China, played by Canadian-Chinese actor Dashan (Mark Rowswell), and broadcast by China Central Television (CCTV).

Historical examples in World War II  = Germany and the Soviet Union as co-belligerents in Poland = After the invasion of Poland in September 1939, Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union partitioned Poland according to the terms of the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact. Although both countries invaded Poland they had no formal alliance; the Pact primarily served as an agreement of mutual neutrality. = Finland as co- belligerent with Germany in the Continuation War = Co-belligerence (, ) is also the term used by Finland for its military co-operation with Germany during World War II. During the Continuation War (1941‚Äì1944), both countries had the Soviet Union as a common enemy. Finnish reentry into World War II was a direct consequence of Germany's attack on the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. While the Allies often referred to Finland as one of the Axis Powers, Finland was never a signatory to the German-Italian-Japanese Tripartite Pact of September 1940. The Allies, in turn, pointed to the fact that Finland, like (Fascist) Italy and (Militarist) Japan, as well as a number of countries including neutral (Falangist) Spain, belonged to Hitler's Anti- Comintern Pact. Adolf Hitler declared Germany to be im Bunde (in league) with the Finns, but Finland's government declared their intention to remain first a non-belligerent country, then co-belligerent after the Soviets started bombing Finnish cities all over the country, not the least due to a remaining neutralist public opinion. The truth was somewhere in-between: # By mining the Gulf of Finland Finland's navy together with the Kriegsmarine before the start of Barbarossa locked the Leningrad fleet in, making the Baltic Sea and the Gulf of Bothnia practically domestic German waters, where submarines and navy could be trained without risks in addition to securing Finland's fundamental trade routes for food and fuel. # Germany was allowed to recruit a Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS which served under direct German command in operations away from Finnish-Soviet border. (It also recruited from non- belligerents Sweden and Spain. Germany did not recruit from countries formally allied with it until 1943 when Italy surrendered)Mauno Jokipii, Hitlerin Saksa ja sen vapaaehtoisliikkeet, Suomalaisen Kirjallisuuden Seura, 2002, # The initial Finnish offensive was co-ordinated with Operation Barbarossa (see Continuation War for details of the pre-offensive staff talks). # Finnish invasion of the Karelian Isthmus (northern part was Finnish territory until 1940) and to a lesser extent the occupation of over a half of Soviet Karelia contributed to the Siege of Leningrad. Finland also helped to block Soviet supply deliveries into the city and hosted, supplied and participated within the Lake Ladoga Flotilla which aimed to disrupt Soviet supply delivery. # A German army corps invaded the Soviet Union from Finnish Lapland, and German army and air force units reinforced the Finnish army during the decisive 1944 battles on the Karelian isthmus. Finland and Germany executed several joint German-Finnish Operations at the Finnish front. The Finnish invasion far exceeded the territory of pre Winter War Finland. Finland occupied as far as Lake Onega and Finnish troops even crossed the river Svir for a possible link- up with German troops. # Britain declared war on Finland on 6 December 1941. # Germany supplied Finland with military equipment of all kinds, ranging from weapons, uniforms and helmets to tanks and assault guns. Finland in exchange delivered rare resources like nickel. # Finland also extradited eight Jews (on orders from the then head of the State Police Arno Anthoni, who was deeply antisemite ‚Äì the Prime Minister of Finland, Paavo Lipponen issued an official apology for deportations in 2000), 76 political prisoners with non-Finnish citizenship and 2,600‚Äì2,800 prisoners of war to Germany in exchange for 2,100 Fennic/Karelian prisoners of war from Germany. Some of the extradited had Finnish nationality but had moved to Soviet Union before the war, received Soviet citizenship and returned to Finland in secret. # Jews were not discriminated against. A number of them served in the Finnish Army (204 during the Winter War, and about 300 during the Continuation War). When Himmler tried to persuade Finnish leaders to deport the Jews to Nazi concentration camps, the Commander-in-chief of Finland Gustaf Mannerheim is said to have replied: \\"While Jews serve in my army I will not allow their deportation\\". Yad Vashem records that 22 Finnish Jews died in the Holocaust, all fighting for the Finnish armed forces. Two Jewish officers of the Finnish army and one Jewish member of the Lotta Sv√§rd women's paramilitary organisation were awarded the German Iron Cross, but they refused to accept them. = The Allies as co- belligerents with former enemies = The term was used in 1943‚Äì45 during the latter stages of World War II to define the status of former allies and associates of Germany (Italy from 1943, Bulgaria, Romania and Finland from 1944), after they joined the Allies war against Germany.

It is sometimes called Dykem (as a generonym dubbed after a popular brand). It is used to stain or paint a metal object with a very thin layer of dye that can be scratched off using a scriber or other sharp instrument to reveal a bright, yet very narrow line in the metal underneath. The advantages are that any existing scratches are covered with the dye and the new lines have a contrasting background. Marking blue is made by mixing methylated spirits with shellac and gentian violet.. This is not to be confused with the non-drying engineer's blue, made by mixing Prussian blue with oil or grease. Despite this, it is sometimes called engineer's blue, which can cause confusion. Alternatives A felt tip marker can be used as they are convenient and tend not to dry up as quickly; marking blue in the form of dye or ink has a tendency to dry in the containers and become unusable quickly. On rough structures, such as castings or forgings, whitewash or a mixture of chalk and water can be used. A solution of copper sulfate, distilled water, and a few drops of sulfuric acid can be used on machined surfaces. This thin copper coating is more resistant to rough handling and the action of cutting fluid.

Its stocky body is most notable for its long, white-tipped, rounded fins. Though slow-moving, they are opportunistic and aggressive, and are reputed to be dangerous to shipwreck survivors. Recent studies show steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued as the chief ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range. Taxonomy The oceanic whitetip shark, or lesser white shark, was described in 1831 by naturalist Ren√©-Primev√®re Lesson, who named the shark Carcharhinus maou. It was next described by Cuban Felipe Poey in 1861 as Squalus longimanus. The name Pterolamiops longimanus has also been used. The species epithet ' refers to the size of its pectoral fins (' translates from Latin as \\"long hands\\"). The oceanic whitetip shark has many common names in English: Brown Milbert's sand bar shark, brown shark, nigano shark, oceanic white-tipped whaler, and whitetip shark. The rules of the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature are that in general the first-published description has priority; therefore, the valid scientific name for the oceanic whitetip shark should be Carcharhinus maou. However, Lesson's name remained forgotten for so long that Carcharhinus longimanus remains widely accepted. Distribution and habitat The oceanic whitetip is found globally in deep, open oceans, with a temperature greater than , although exceptionally it occurs in water as cold as . It prefers waters between and tends to withdraw from areas when temperatures fall outside of these limits. It was once extremely common and widely distributed, and still inhabits a wide band around the globe; however, recent studies suggest that its numbers have drastically declined. An analysis of the US pelagic longline logbook data between 1992 and 2000 (covering the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic) estimated a decline of 70% over that period. It is found worldwide between 45¬∞N and 43¬∞S latitude. In September 2004, a vagrant oceanic whitetip shark was seen in the brackish waters of Gullmarsfjorden in Sweden; it died shortly after. This is the only North European record and far north of its usual range limit. The shark spends most of its time in the upper layer of the ocean‚Äîto a depth of ‚Äîand prefers off-shore, deep-ocean areas. According to longline capture data, increasing distance from land correlates to a greater population of sharks. Occasionally, it is found close to land, in waters as shallow as , mainly around midocean islands such as Hawaii, or in areas where the continental shelf is narrow with access to nearby deep water. It is typically solitary, though gatherings have been observed where food is plentiful. Unlike many animals, it does not have a diurnal cycle, and is active both day and night. Its swimming style is slow, with widely spread pectoral fins. Despite its habitual isolation from members of its own species, pilot fish, dolphinfish, and remora may accompany it. In 1988, Jeremy Stafford-Deitsch reported seeing an individual accompanied by a shortfin pilot whale. Description Upper teeth Lower teeth C. longimanus most distinguishing characteristics are its long, wing-like pectoral and dorsal fins. The fins are significantly larger than most other shark species, and are conspicuously rounded. The shark's nose is rounded and its eyes are circular, with nictitating membranes. C. longimanus has a 'typical', although somewhat flattened requiem shark body, often with a mildly humpbacked aspect. It is grey-bronze dorsally and white ventrally, with some mottling on the fins. The oceanic whitetip shark is a medium-sized requiem shark. The largest specimen ever caught measured , an exceptionally large size considering few specimens are known to exceed a length of . The maximum reported weight is . The female is typically larger than the male by . Males attain sexual maturity at and females about . In the Gulf of Mexico in the 1950s, the mean weight of oceanic whitetip sharks was . In the 1990s, the sharks of the species from the same area averaged only . Most of its fins (dorsal, pectoral, pelvic and caudal) have white tips (juvenile specimens and some adults may lack these). Along with white tips, the fins may be mottled, and young specimens can have black marks. A saddle-like marking may be apparent between first and second dorsal fins. The shark has several kinds of teeth. Those in the mandible (lower jaw) have a thin, serrated tip and are relatively small and triangular (somewhat fang-like). Between 13 and 15 teeth are on either side of the symphysis. The teeth in the upper jaw are triangular, but much larger and broader with entirely serrated edges‚Äî14 or 15 occur along each side of the symphysis. The denticles lie flat and typically have between five and seven ridges. Diet C. longimanus feeds mainly on pelagic cephalopods and bony fish. However, its diet can be far more varied and less selective‚Äîit is known to eat threadfins, stingrays, sea turtles, birds, gastropods, crustaceans, and mammalian carrion. The bony fish it feeds on include lancetfish, oarfish, barracuda, jacks, dolphinfish, marlin, tuna, and mackerel. Its feeding methods include biting into groups of fish and swimming through schools of tuna with an open mouth. When feeding with other species, it becomes aggressive. Peter Benchley, author of Jaws, observed this shark swimming among pilot whales and eating their faeces. Behaviour Oceanic whitetip photographed at the Elphinstone reef, alt=Shark accompanied by group of fish with black and white vertical stripes and split tail fin The oceanic whitetip is usually solitary and slow-moving, and tends to cruise near the top of the water column, covering vast stretches of empty water scanning for possible food sources. Evidence in the form of sucker scars on the skin of an individual filmed off Hawaii indicate that the species may also dive deep enough to battle with giant squid.https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/2020/06/sharks-fought- large-deep-sea-squid-first-time Until the 16th century, sharks were known to mariners as \\"sea dogs\\" and the oceanic whitetip, the most common ship- following shark, exhibits dog-like behaviour when its interest is piqued: when attracted to something that appears to be food, its movements become more avid and it approaches cautiously but stubbornly, retreating and maintaining a safe distance if driven off, but ready to rush in if the opportunity presents itself. Oceanic whitetips are not fast swimmers, but they are capable of surprising bursts of speed. Whitetips commonly compete for food with silky sharks, making up for its comparatively leisurely swimming style with aggressive displays. Groups often form when individuals converge on a food source. Segregation by sex and size does not seem to occur. Whitetips follow schools of tuna or squid, and trail groups of cetaceans such as dolphins and pilot whales, scavenging their prey. Their instinct is to follow baitfish migrations that accompany ocean-going ships. When whaling took place in warm waters, oceanic whitetips were often responsible for much of the damage to floating carcasses. Reproduction Mating season is in early summer in the northwest Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean, although females captured in the Pacific have been found with embryos year round, suggesting a longer mating season there. The shark is viviparous‚Äîembryos develop in utero and are fed by a placental sac. Its gestation period is one year. Litter sizes vary from one to 15 with the young born at a length around . Sexual maturity is reached around for males and for females. Relationship with humans Oceanic whitetip with a rusty fish hook in its mouth alt=Photo of shark with black and white-striped fish The oceanic whitetip is a commercially important species for its fins, meat, and oil. It is eaten fresh, smoked, dried, and salted and its hide is used for leather. It is subject to fishing pressure throughout virtually its whole range,although it is more often taken as bycatch than by design, since it is drawn to longline bait that is intended for other species. Oceanographic researcher Jacques Cousteau described the oceanic whitetip as \\"the most dangerous of all sharks\\". Despite the greater notoriety of the great white shark and other sharks habitually found nearer the shore, the oceanic whitetip is suspected to be responsible for many fatal shark bites on humans, as a result of predation on survivors of shipwrecks or downed aircraft. Such incidents are not included in common shark-bite indices for the 20th and 21st centuries, and as a result, the oceanic whitetip does not have the highest number of recorded incidents; only five bites had been recorded as of 2009. After the USS Indianapolis was torpedoed on 30 July 1945, most sailors who survived the sinking reportedly died from exposure to the elements rather than from shark bites. However, according to survivor accounts published in several books about sharks and shark attacks, potentially hundreds of the Indianapolis crew were killed by sharks before a plane spotted them on the 5th day after the sinking. Oceanic whitetips are believed to have been responsible for most if not all of those attacks. Also during World War II, the RMS Nova Scotia, a steamship carrying about 1,000 people near South Africa, was sunk by a German submarine. One hundred and ninety-two people survived; many deaths were attributed to the whitetip. In Egypt in 2010, one oceanic whitetip was implicated in several bites on tourists in the Red Sea near Sharm El Sheikh. The shark was recognised individually by the bite mark taken out of its upper tail lobe. Accumulating evidence revealed this shark to have been conditioned to being hand fed. Upon associating the divers with an easy supply of food, it bit the divers and snorkelers on the areas of the body where it had seen the fish being kept, namely, in the fanny packs the divers carried. This caused the shark to target the divers' buttock and thigh regions in the hope of obtaining a meal. The 2010 Sharm El Sheikh bites resulted in one death and four injuries to humans. The attacks might have been instigated by the overfishing in that area of the Red Sea, effectively forcing the shark closer to shore where the bites took place.Egypt: German tourist killed in fourth Sharm el-Sheikh shark attack in a week. telegraph.co.uk (5 December 2010)US Experts Head to Egypt to Probe Shark Attacks. CBS News (7 December 2010) Captivity The oceanic whitetip has fared better in captivity than other large sharks of the open ocean, such as the mako and blue shark. Among five recorded captive oceanic whitetips, the three with time records all lived for more than a year in captivity. One of these, a female in Monterey Bay Aquarium's Outer-Bay exhibit, lived for more than three years before dying in 2003, during which it grew .https://napavalleyregister.com/news/monterey- aquarium-whitetip-shark-dies-after-three- years/article_f1a6dbf9-4fac-5580-8e47-ebe2c17236f8.html The two remaining lack a time record, but grew about during their time in captivity. Conservation status In 1969, Lineaweaver and Backus wrote of the oceanic whitetip: \\"[it is] extraordinarily abundant, perhaps the most abundant large animal, large being over 100 pounds [45 kg], on the face of the earth\\". Little further population study occurred until 2003, when the numbers were estimated to have dropped by as much as 70% in the Northwest and Western Central Atlantic between 1992 and 2000. Another study focusing on the Gulf of Mexico, using a mix of data from US pelagic longline surveys from the mid-1950s and observations from the late 1990s, estimated a decline in numbers in this location of 99.3% over this period. However, changes in fishing practices and data collection methods complicate estimates. As a result of these findings, its status on the IUCN Red List was moved to \\"Critically Endangered\\" globally. Under the 1995 UN Agreement on the Conservation and Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, coastal and fishing states are specifically required to adopt measures to conserve listed species, but little progress is visible on the oceanic whitetip. From 3 January 2013, the shark was fully protected in New Zealand territorial waters under the Wildlife Act 1953. The New Zealand Department of Conservation has classified the oceanic whitetip shark as \\"Migrant\\" with the qualifier \\"Secure Overseas\\" under the New Zealand Threat Classification System. In March 2013, three endangered commercially valuable sharks, the hammerheads, the oceanic whitetip, and porbeagle were added to Appendix II of CITES, bringing shark fishing and commerce of these species under licensing and regulation. On 30 January 2018, NOAA Fisheries published a final rule to list the oceanic whitetip shark as a threatened species under the United States Endangered Species Act (ESA) (83 FR 4153).
