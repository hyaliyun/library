It is an official remake of the 2009 Tollywood film Ravi Teja-starrer Kick. The film stars Salman Khan, Jacqueline Fernandez, Randeep Hooda and Nawazuddin Siddiqui. The screenplay was adapted by Nadiadwala and Chetan Bhagat. The film released on Eid-Ul-Fitr 25 July 2014 in about 5,000 screens worldwide. Plot Shaina Mehra (Jacqueline Fernandez) is a psychiatrist living in Warsaw, Poland. Her father Brijesh Mehra (Saurabh Shukla) brings a marriage proposal and asks her to meet Himanshu Tyagi (Randeep Hooda). Himanshu and Shaina meet in a train, where Shaina reveals that she had an ex- boyfriend named Devi Lal Singh (Salman Khan) and talks about her crazy experiences with him. Devi is an intelligent, adventurous man who is always looking for a \\"kick\\" in his life. When Shaina meets Devi, she is trying to help her friend, Vidhi (Sumona Chakravarti), elope with her lover who is Devi's friend. Devi gets them married in a temple, but also helps her mother follow them and reach the temple for \\"kick\\". Shaina meets Devi's father Ratan Lal Singh (Mithun Chakraborty) and his mother Rati (Archana Puran Singh). Devi and Shaina date and fall in love. On Shaina's suggestion, Devi accepts a job in a chemical lab, but resigns in a few days suffering from the lack of \\"kick\\". Shaina scolds him and Devi breaks up with her and moves away. Himanshu, a police officer, shares his experiences with a thief he hates, because he cannot stop him. The robber, called \\"Devil\\", targets the rich people associated with Shiv Gajra (Nawazuddin Siddiqui), a corrupt businessman, and robs them. The robber is none other than Devi. When Himanshu is unsuccessful in catching Devil, Devi contacts Himanshu and refers to him as a partner and insults him by calling him a loser which is actually a clue that Devi gives Himanshu. Shaina, in Poland, spots Devi, who has come there for treatment after losing his memory in an accident. Shaina offers to handle Devi's case and take him home. Devi is acting about his memory loss, his real plan is to befriend and fool Himanshu and rob Shiv, who will be coming to Poland. Devi enters a charity function and robs Shiv, but Himanshu and Shaina discover Devi's true identity and Devi escapes. Himanshu spots Devi and warns him he will be killed, but Devi says that he will rob a huge party fund on 14 November. Devi dares Himanshu to kill him on the 14th, otherwise Devi will be standing in front of him on 15 November, and he won't be able to do anything. In a flashback, Devi's true intentions and good deeds are revealed by Ratan Lal. He tells Shaina that his son is committing robberies to help poor children who are suffering from diseases. Devi saved a girl named Jhumki after reading a letter in the hands of her dead parents, and got the most powerful \\"kick\\" when she smiled at him. When a doctor tells him that several children are suffering from diseases, he saves them by robbing to get money for their treatments, knowing that it will give a lot of \\"kick\\". On 14 November, after fighting Shiv's henchmen, Devi kills Shiv. Himanshu is set up with officers to shoot Devi, but kids block his shot. 14 November is Children's Day, and the sick children are going to pray for Devi, after which Himanshu realizes the robberies were for the kids. On 15 November, Devi joins the police force to catch Devil. He arrives at the police station and stands in front of Himanshu, who is unable to do anything about the situation, therefore completing his challenge. Himanshu is taken off of the case and it is given to Devi, who is now a police officer. Devi then thanks Himanshu, saying that he was never against him, but he is against the corrupt system.

After much discussions, Jacqueline Fernandez was signed on to act in the film. US-based Abhijat Joshi, who had written the scripts for Munna Bhai M.B.B.S. and Lage Raho Munnabhai was approached to write the script in 2009. Nadiawala wanted the script to be prepared during the release of 3 Idiots, when Joshi had come back to India.

Some scenes were shot at Mehboob Studios in February 2014 and at the Film City studio in Mumbai. In October 2013, while the shooting was in progress outside the city of Mumbai, the Film Studio Settings & Allied Mazdoor Union asked Sajid to pay them wages for one and a half shifts, which he refused. The workers stopped shooting for a week and only resumed when Sajid agreed to the worker's demands. The shooting of the movie Roy had to be postponed due to Fernandez's commitments to this movie. Fernandez started learning the Urdu language specifically for the film with a coach who was hired by Khan.

Typically when MIMO is deployed using two power amplifiers for two transmit antennas, there is a risk that both power amplifiers are not optimally used. Non-MIMO traffic would be using up to half of the available power whereas MIMO traffic could use the full power. This could potentially have adverse impact on the overall cell throughput. VAM is used to achieve the goal of power balancing the physical channels across the multiple physical antennas especially when MIMO is deployed in the downlink. VAM gives an illusion to the UE that there are actually fewer antennas at the base station than it actually has. The unbalanced balanced power across two transmits paths are transformed into balanced power at physical antenna ports by VAM. This is achieved using phase and amplitude coefficients (V11, V12, V21, V22) as depicted in the figure. Thus both the power amplifiers are optimally used even for signals transmitted on the first antenna.

It was published on January 7, 2014. Like the other novels, the story is narrated by Natalie Teeger, Monk's assistant. It is the second novel in the series to be written by Hy Conrad. Plot summary Natalie completes the requirements and receives a license as a private investigator, and proceeds to attend a business seminar at sea with Adrian Monk. When the alarm is pulled and the ship drops anchor, they discover the dead body of the cruise director in the sea. She has alcohol in her system, so her death is deemed an accident, but Adrian Monk isn't convinced. List of characters=Characters from the television series= *Adrian Monk: The titular detective, played in the series by Tony Shalhoub *Natalie Teeger: Monk's loyal assistant and the narrator of the book, played on the series by Traylor Howard Trivia In his author's note, Hy Conrad noted that this novel was adapted from the script for a never- filmed episode of season 3 called \\"Mr. Monk Is At Sea.\\" The premise of that episode would have had Monk and Sharona Fleming investigate a murder on a cruise ship. Had the episode been filmed, it probably would have taken the place of \\"Mr. Monk and the Game Show,\\" the sole episode of the series where none of the supporting cast appear. Conrad noted that while USA Network approved the script, the episode got canned because they were unable to find a real cruise ship to secure for filming, as cruise lines were very sensitive about murders being committed on-board or people falling overboard. No one wanted to loan a ship for filming, even when the killer's identity and the body count were changed. The script subsequently ended up in the vault. In the next few seasons, the writers would turn to the script of \\"Mr. Monk Is At Sea\\" when running low on ideas and make calls, but it became the show's white whale. Therefore, Mr. Monk Gets on Board is described by Conrad as being the plot of \\"Mr. Monk Is At Sea,\\" but with some changes: namely, the replacement of Sharona with Natalie, the addition of a subplot involving a book collector named Malcolm Leeds, and a visit to Mexico that includes a meeting with Captain Alameda, the San Macros police captain from season 2's \\"Mr. Monk Goes to Mexico\\".

His death under suspicious circumstances in 1937 allowed his rival Khorloogiin Choibalsan to consolidate power and subsequently launch the Great Terror during which 30,000 to 35,000 Mongolians died. Career Demid was born in 1900 in present-day Ikh-Tamir, Arkhangai Province. In 1921 he joined the Mongolian People's Party and fought as a partisan during the Mongolian Revolution of 1921. After the revolution, Demid served in the Mongolian military and taught at Mongolia's Military Academy. From 1926 to 1929 he studied at the Red Army Cavalry School in Tver, returning to Mongolia in 1929 to take command of the Military Academy. In 1930 he was elected as member of the Presidium (or Politburo) of the Central Committee of the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party and named army commander-in-chief. By the time the government adopted the New Turn policy in 1932, Demid had become one of Mongolia's most important and influential leaders. Through the 1930s he held several important political and military posts including; president of the military council, minister of war, and second deputy chairman of the council of ministers. Demid was a strong proponent of technological modernization of Mongolia's military and under his command the military substantially increased stock of automobiles, trucks, planes and modern weapons. Demid was also known to be weary of the military's excessive reliance on Soviet advisers but later advocated the stationing of Soviet troops in Mongolia in 1935. In 1936 Choibalsan and Demid were appointed Marshals of the Armed Forces. Death Demid died at Tayga Station (in northeastern Novosibirsk) on August 22, 1937 while on board the Trans-Siberian Railway en route to Moscow. His death, at the age of 37, was officially attributed to food poisoning but the timing and circumstances remain suspicious. Choibalsan, tapped by Josef Stalin and the NKVD to be the next leader of the Mongolian People's Republic, had always resented Demid's popularity and the death of his rival cleared the way for Choibalsan to accede to the dual role of sole Commander-in-Chief of the Mongolian military and minister of war, in addition to being minister of interior. Within 24 hours Choibalsan issued Order 366 which declared that many in Mongolia ‚Äúhad fallen under the influence of Japanese spies and provocateurs.‚Äù A few days later Demid himself was posthumously declared the head of a counter-revolutionary organization and a Japanese spy. Demid's widow Navch, his two brothers, and his father were arrested. By the end of August, Stalin had ordered the stationing of 30,000 Red Army troops in Mongolia to counter Japanese military movements in Manchuria and dispatched Soviet Deputy NKVD Commissar Mikhail Frinovsky to Ulaanbaatar to launch sweeping and violent purges against Buddhist clergy, intelligentsia, political dissidents, ethnic Buryats and Khazaks, and other \\"enemies of the revolution\\", similar to the purges he had so effectively managed in the Soviet Union under NKVD Chief Nikolai Yezhov. Demid was rehabilitated in June 1962 and restored as a member of the MPRP.

Plot On behalf of Senator Baldwin (Henry O'Neill), the owner of the world's largest Chinese jade collection, detective Steve McBride (Barton MacLane) investigate a death threat involving the priceless jade tablets that were brought to the United States by three adventurers, who are now on the hit list of an oriental gang. A note written in Chinese warns the impending doom at midnight unless a ransom is paid for the valuable jades, which have been stolen. Steve is put on the case to protect the people who were involved in smuggling the jades into the country. That night, Torchy Blane (Glenda Farrell) joins Steve at the Adventurers Club where he and his assistant Gahagan (Tom Kennedy) are guarding the threatened victims, Fitzhugh, Mr. Mansfield (James Stephenson) and Captain Condon (Patric Knowles). Once midnight has passed, they leave, but Fitzhugh is machine-gunned in his car and killed. A note found in the car warns that Mansfield will be the next to die. He is later found dead after smoking a poisoned cigarette, and his body vanishes mysteriously before the coroner arrives at the crime scene. Senator Baldwin's daughter Janet Baldwin and her fianc√© Dick Staunton, are ordered by the mysterious killer to deliver $250,000 ransom to the last buoy in the New York city harbor.

The Kunstsalon came into being in 2009, after the merger of two companies. View of the gallery in the Residenzstrasse, Munich History=Kunstsalon Franke= The Kunstsalon Franke-Schenk was founded in 1913 as the Kunstsalon Franke, by the metal goods manufacturer Willy Franke (1875 Altenburg ‚Äì 1957 Leipzig). Until 1961, the art and antiques business Kunstsalon Franke was situated in Leipzig. The family company dealt mainly in paintings, specialising in Old Masters. The son Walter Franke (1901 Dresden ‚Äì 1968 Baden-Baden), an art historian, joined the management in 1927. Forced to flee in 1961 because of repression in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) and the expropriation of art dealers, the Kunstsalon Franke settled in Baden-Baden. Here, the third generation in the person of Michael Franke (1939 Leipzig ‚Äì 1985 Baden-Baden) took over the management of the Kunstsalon Franke in 1967. During the 1970s Michael Franke expanded the company further and he and his wife Catherine Franke together intensified the antiques business, with additional subsidiaries for silver and furniture. In 1971 Michael Franke became chairman of the Baden-W√ºrttemberg art dealers‚Äô association. Rooms in the gallery in the Royal Palace, Leipzig, around 1935 After his early death in 1985 Catherine Franke concentrated the art dealership on classics of modern painting. Among the artists in the gallery were Marc Chagall, Karl Hofer, Max Pechstein, Karl Schmidt-Rottluff and Alexej von Jawlensky, and in particular Lovis Corinth and Max Liebermann. In 1992 Catherine Franke organised a Max Liebermann exhibition, which she presented at Cologne and Zurich, and in Berlin, at Liebermann‚Äôs villa at the Wannsee. Through her efforts the villa was given protected monument status and the Max Liebermann Society of the Liebermann villa was founded. From this year on the Zurich Galerie Dr. Schenk and the Munich Kunstsalon Franke collaborated on joint projects. =Galerie Dr. Schenk= The Galerie Dr. Schenk was founded at Zurich in 1984. The art historian Rolf Schenk began working as an art dealer in 1979 at the Galerie Carroll in Munich. In 1981, after obtaining his doctorate in art history, he moved his area of operations to Zurich, where he worked for the Koller auction house and the Galerie J√∂rg Stuker in Bern. From 1984 to 1993 the Galerie Dr. Schenk dealt principally with paintings of the 18th to the 20th centuries and featured Swiss artists of international rank, such as Cuno Amiet, Albert Anker, Francois Diday, Giovanni Giacometti and Augusto Giacometti, Ferdinand Hodler and Giovanni Segantini and also Gottardo Segantini.

These proteins are generally produced during viral infection; Interferon (IFN) treatment; and during pathogen recognition (Pathogen associated molecular pattern recognition) by the immune system during infections. So far, four families of this protein have been identified in humans which are IFIT1, IFIT2, IFIT3 and IFIT5 and other variants have been found in different species. Birds, marsupials, frogs and fish have been found to produce only IFIT5 type proteins. These proteins differ from each other in having different numbers of tetratricopeptide repeats (TPRs). The IFIT1 is known to possess 6 TPRs and IFIT2 has 4 TPRs. The IFIT proteins that are produced in humans and mice are 40%-45% similar. It is thought that the gene encoding IFIT proteins in different species has a common ancestry.  Origins of IFIT Proteins  IFIT protein encoding genes (IFIT genes) are known to have originated in vertebrates about 450 million years ago. These genes are mostly conserved throughout evolution suggesting that they have a common protective role in all species.  Anti viral mechanism of IFIT proteins  IFIT proteins are suggested to show anti viral activity in two ways; one, by binding specifically to viral nucleic acids and the other, by directly binding to eukaryotic initiation factor 3 (eIF3) and preventing eIF3 from initiating the translational process. Experimental data and the three dimensional structure of IFIT1 reveals that the proteins bind to viral PPP RNA in a sequence specific manner. Few viruses like Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and influenza A produce PPP RNA nucleic acid during their life cycle.

More than 2,000 students were attending classes at the time of the incident. The institute was later renamed to Aitzaz Hasan Shaheed High School. The anniversary of his death is observed by Pakistan on 6 January. His life is covered by a biographical film Salute. Aitzaz's action in saving his classmates captured the hearts of Pakistan, and he was hailed as a Shahid (martyr) and National hero. Later, the Government of Pakistan posthumously awarded him Sitara-e-Shujaat (Star of Bravery) . He was named as the Herald's Person of the Year for 2014.  Life  Aitzaz Hasan's father is Mujahid Ali, who was in the United Arab Emirates at the time of the attack. It was typical for men in this impoverished region to go abroad, including the Gulf region, to provide for their families. The area where Aitzaz Hasan lived is home to many Shi'ite Muslims, a number of whom have been killed by Taliban. The teenager was known for openly criticizing armed radical Sunni groups.  Death  On 6 January 2014, Aitzaz was outside the school gate of Government High School, Ibrahimzai, in Hangu, with two other schoolmates. Aitzaz had not been allowed to attend morning assembly due to his tardiness that day. Allegedly, at this time a 20-to-25-year-old man approached the gate and stated he was there to \\"take admission\\". One of the students noticed a detonator on the man's vest, whereupon Aitzaz's schoolmates ran inside while Aitzaz confronted the suicide bomber, who then detonated his vest. According to other accounts, Aitzaz was on his way to school when he spotted a suspicious person. When Aitzaz tried to stop him, he started walking faster towards the school. In an attempt to stop the bomber, Aitzaz threw a stone which failed to hit him. Then Aitzaz ran towards the person and grabbed him, prompting the suicide bomber to detonate his explosive-laden vest. Aitzaz died at the scene. No other students were harmed. Aitzaz's act thus may have saved the lives of hundreds of students.  Aftermath  Aitzaz's father said that his son made a sacrifice to save the lives of others: \\"My son made his mother cry but saved hundreds of mothers from crying for their children.\\" Scores of people attended his funeral to pay their respects. A floral wreath was laid on the grave of Aitzaz Hasan on behalf of the Pakistani Army chief. Aitzaz's story led to an outpouring of emotion on television and on social media, where the hashtag #onemillionaitzazs trended on Twitter. A Facebook page has been set up in tribute to his act. The group Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack. The Minister for Information in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Shah Farman, said that Aitzaz was a \\"real hero and true face of the people of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\\". Pakistani Chief of the Army Staff General Raheel Sharif said that Aitzaz Hasan is \\"a national hero, who has sacrificed his today for our tomorrow.\\" Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani teenager education activist and winner of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, described Aitzaz as \\"brave and courageous\\" and said \\"his bravery must never be forgotten\\". She pledged to donate ¬£5000 to Hasan's family. Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam (F), led by Fazal-ur- Rehman (politician) described Aitzaz as a \\"Mujahid\\", and said \\"he is symbol of resistance against terrorism\\". On 12 January, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) chairperson Imran Khan announced the setting up of a trust fund for Aitzaz Hassan's family. He also said that he will establish an Aitizaz Hasan Fund. On 14 January, the provincial governmental representatives announced a Rs 5 million package for the family of the teen and renamed his school as the \\"Aitzaz Hasan Shaheed High School\\". In 2016, a film named Salute was released to tribute him. A hostel was constructed at College of EME named after him. = Awards and honors = Many people demanded that the Nishan-e-Haider, or a similar award, be awarded to Aitzaz Hasan posthumously. The office of Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif then recommended President Mamnoon Husain to confer Aitzaz Hasan with the high civil award Sitara-e-Shujaat (Star of Bravery). The award was received by Hasan's family on 23 March during Pakistan's national day. On 12 January, the International Human Rights Commission (IHRC) bestowed a global bravery award on Hasan. Aitzaz was named as Herald's Person of the year 2014. Herald's annual Person of the Year project sets out to recognize those individuals in Pakistan who had a profound influence on the news and who embodied, for good or ill, what was important about the year. Hasan, whose sacrifice attained further poignancy after the 16 December attack on Peshawar's Army Public School, emerged as the winner in a three-way voting process that included online voting, postal ballots and input from a panel of 10 eminent Pakistanis.

He is most renowned for the design of the Helsinki City Theatre (1961‚Äì67).  Early life and education  Timo Jussi Penttil√§ was born 16 March 1931 in Tampere to Arvo Mikko Penttil√§ and Ester Elviira Matinheimo. His father was agronomist and acted as a supervisor improving cattle in the country. Penttil√§ graduated from Tampere secondary school in 1950 and went on to study architecture at Helsinki University of Technology, graduating in 1956. Career In 1957‚Äì1959 he worked for architect Aarne Ervi before founding his own office. His breakthrough work was Sampola House, the Tampere Adult Education Centre, which Penttil√§ designed together with Kari Virta in 1958 and which was completed in 1960. The following year, at the age of 30, Penttil√§ won the architecture competition for the design of the Helsinki City Theatre, a work which when completed in 1967 received much critical acclaim. The building is an example of Penttil√§'s soft, human-centric Modernism which has similarities to the mature works of Finland's most well-known architect, Alvar Aalto; indeed the building is often mistakenly assumed to be an Aalto design. The Helsinki City Theatre has remained Penttil√§'s most renowned work, but among his other building designs the best known are the Ratina Stadium in Tampere (1965) the Hanasaari B power station in Helsinki (1974), the Salmisaari power station (with Kari Lind and Heikki Saarela) in Helsinki (1985). During his career, Penttil√§ was criticized within the Finnish architectural profession for following uncompromisingly the modernist desire for experimentation and for defending the autonomy of architecture. Penttil√§ was director of the Museum of Finnish Architecture in 1976‚Äì1980, and was a frequent contributor to the Finnish Architecture Review (Arkkitehti) from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, writing a number of polemical articles about architecture and the profession. An exhibition of his works was held at the Royal Institute of British Architects in London in 1980. During the late 1970s, Penttil√§ participated in a number of architectural competitions for the design of cultural and public buildings in the Middle East, including Bahrain's cultural centre (1976), the Iranian National Library in Tehran (1978), and the United Arab Emirates Ministry of Foreign Affairs (1979) - but none of which were built. In the later 1980s he courted controversy by designing a series of four 40-storey skyscrapers for the centre of his home town, Tampere. Local grass- roots opposition brought an end to the scheme which had been commissioned by the industrial company Tampella to redevelop an area where their factory then presently stood. Penttil√§ was a visiting lecturer at the University of California, Berkeley in 1968‚Äì69. He was professor of architecture at the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna from 1980 to 1996, where he succeeded Roland Rainer. After his retirement he lived in Italy and Lapland (Finland). Following his death it emerged that he had written an extensive book on architecture theory. This was eventually published in 2013, by the Finnish publishers Gaudeamus, under the title \\"Oikeat ja v√§√§r√§t arkkitehdit ‚Äì 2000 vuotta arkkitehtuuriteoriaa\\" (Right and wrong architects ‚Äì 2000 years of architecture theory). Excerpts from his notes, written in English, have been in published in Roger Connah's book \\"The School of Exile ‚Äì Timo Penttil√§ for and against architecture theory\\" (2015).

It is ostensibly an unlicensed copy of an American Boeing Insitu ScanEagle drone captured and reverse-engineered by Iran, but has some design changes. Iran captured a Scaneagle in December 2012 and the Qods Yasir was unveiled about ten months later, in September 2013. The Yasir's only state operator is Iran. It has been exported to at least one non- state actor and is alleged to have been exported to several more. Yasir UAVs have been used by Iranian allies in the civil wars in Iraq and Syria, likely because of their small footprint compared to larger Iranian UAVs. Development A Yasir on launcher. In 4 December 2012 Iran said it had captured an American Boeing Insitu ScanEagle that violated its airspace over the Persian Gulf. The U.S. Navy stated that none of its ScanEagles were missing. However, there are other ScanEagle operators in the Middle East. Later that month, on 17 December 2012, Iran amended their claim to three ScanEagles and said they would attempt to reverse engineer and mass produce the ScanEagle. Bizarrely, Iran also claimed that they had already reverse- engineered, mass produced, and entered the ScanEagle into service. The UAV was unveiled to the media in September 2013 when it entered service and received the name \\"Yasir.\\" In October 2013, the IRGC presented Russian Air Force Commander Lieutenant General Viktor Bondarev with a Yasir drone as a gift.  Design The Yasir has swept back wings and a large payload bubble under its nose. Unlike the ScanEagle, it has an inverted V-tail and a twin-boom empennage. The Yasir has a single, unidentified, two-bladed propeller engine. It carries an electro-optical payload. It can also be fitted with an explosive payload for use as a disposable strike munition. The Yasir is 1.19 meters long, has a wingspan of 3.05 meters, and weighs 18 kg.

He was formerly a British diplomat, a writer, and a campaigner. From 2011-2015, he was the UK's Ambassador to Lebanon. He is a Visiting Professor at New York University and author of 'The Naked Diplomat' (Harper Collins, 2016). Early life Fletcher was born in Kent, and educated at The Harvey Grammar School, and at Hertford College, Oxford, where he was awarded first class honours in Modern History. He was Junior Common Room President at Hertford College. Career Tom Fletcher is a Visiting Professor of International Relations at New York University, a Visiting Professor at the Emirates Diplomatic Academy, and an adviser to the Global Business Coalition for Education. He is an Honorary Fellow of Hertford College, Oxford University. In November 2019 he was elected as Principal of Hertford College, and took up the post in September 2020. Fletcher was British Ambassador to Lebanon (2011‚Äì15) and Number 10 Downing Street foreign policy and Northern Ireland adviser to Prime Ministers Tony Blair, Gordon Brown and David Cameron (2007‚Äì11). In his memoirs, Gordon Brown called him \\"indispensable and indefatigable.\\" In \\"For The Record\\", David Cameron wrote \\"There was one man who would prove essential: Tom Fletcher. Tom became my support, sounding board and source of information about virtually every country on Earth.\\" Fletcher previously served as a British diplomat in Nairobi and Paris, and as the Private Secretary to FCO Ministers Baroness Valerie Amos and Chris Mullin. In Kenya, he took part in a high profile charity boxing match with the Mayor of Nairobi, who had t-shirts printed saying \\"Fletcher goes home on a stretcher\\". British Ambassador to Lebanon (2011-2015) While in Beirut, Fletcher pioneered a more open style of diplomacy, with many of his blogposts going viral (Dear Lebanon and Yalla Bye). The BBC made a documentary, \\"The Naked Diplomat\\", about his work. He led UK initiatives on refugee education, job creation and border security. The Daily Telegraph reported that he was behind a secret plan which prevented Islamic State from entering Lebanon from Syria. The UK government budget for Lebanon increased from ¬£2m in 2011 to ¬£200m in 2015. In partnership with Banque du Liban, Tom spearheaded the launch of the UK Lebanon Tech Hub, an international accelerator using London as a platform for Lebanese technology businesses to grow internationally. By December 2018, the hub had helped grow 91 startups raise more than $64 million in venture funding and create more than 2000 jobs in Lebanon and the United Kingdom. Fletcher caused controversy by donating blood after a terrorist attack against the Iranian embassy in Beirut. And becoming a domestic worker to highlight migrant rights. He founded One Lebanon, an annual concert bringing together Lebanese celebrities from across the sectarian divide. Arab News described him as ‚Äúthe anti-diplomat.‚Äù Not in the sense that he sees no value in diplomacy, but in his steadfast refusal to live up to the stereotype expected of the ambassadorial profession. He was commended by many commentators for his viral online farewell which resurrected the old Foreign Officer tradition of the valedictory despatch. In Dec 2015, Fletcher was awarded the Lovie Special Achievement award for his use of social media during his time as British Ambassador in Lebanon. Global Education He is the Project Director of Towards Global Learning Goals - a network that aims to create equal opportunities, to develop the skills needed to thrive in a new economy, and to make it easier for people on the move to adapt. His five part podcast series focused on learning of the head, hand and heart. Since 2017, he has led a review on the future of learning trying to understand how we can help the next generation learn the right things in the right way. He is a Visiting Professor of International Relations at New York University, where he teaches a course on 'Surviving the 21st Century: Power and Statecraft in the Digital Age', and supports the effort to expand peace and global citizenship studies.

The cinematographer Christopher Challis called it the most difficult production he had ever worked on. Lewin had pre-selected the sets on a pre-production tour of Morocco, however, unaware of the technical requirements of the large three-strip camera rig, interiors proved to be too small. Thus, there could be no long shots. Among his other eccentricities the film maker also had a horse transported more than a thousand miles to the set, but finding the tail too short, had fake ones made abroad and sent to the filming location.

Footage for the unique and at the time controversial film was shot by Bob Flieshner. Marc Siegel states that the 33 minute film is \\"generally considered to be one of the masterpieces of the New York underground film scene\\", and that it is a \\"fascinating audio-visual testament to the tragicomic performance of the inimitable Jack Smith\\", who was a photographer and filmmaker and \\"queer muse\\" in New York avant-garde art in the 1960s and 1970s. The film captures Smith wearing dresses and makeup, playing with dolls, and smoking marijuana. Paul Arthur writes that the film contains \\"dizzying quasi- autobiographical rants\\" which spin on sadism, and that like Jacobs' Little Stabs At Happiness, it contains \\"languid improvisations studded with the bare bones of narrative incident or, more accurately, its collapse\\". The film contains Smith droning and singing and wildly cooing and cackling in parts of the film. The \\"lonely little boy\\" episode about a little boy living in a large house with 10 rooms has been cited as being \\"potentially repugnant to many viewers\\" because of its exploration of sadism against children and childhood sexuality. In this episode the narrator confesses to have \\"blown up the penis\\" of a 7-year-old boy with a match. The film contains numerous other elements which were shocking at the time of release such as references to necrophilia, the use of the word \\"cunt\\", the confession of a nun (impersonated in a posh high-pitched voice by Smith) to lesbianism, the holding of a giant would-be dildo, and a portrayal of transvestites. The film features quotes such as \\"Why shave when I can't think of a reason for living\\" and \\"life is a sad business\\", quoting Greta Garbo. \\"Let's Call the Whole Thing Off\\" is then played, described as a \\"burlesque rendering\\" of Robert Siodmak's 1944 film Cobra Woman. The last scene captures Smith stabbing a man in the chest. Hilary Radner and Moya Luckett consider the film to be a camp portrayal of Rose Hobart.

It commemorates the serving men who lost their lives in the two world wars. The memorial consists of an obelisk in Portland stone on a plinth of York stone. It was unveiled in 1921, and more names were added in 1950. The monument is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II listed building. History Widnes Borough Council commissioned a memorial in 1920 to commemorate the citizens of the town who fell in the First World War. Following a competition the design of Harold E. Davies was selected, and Herbert Tyson Smith was appointed as the sculptor. The building contractors were Messrs. Stewart Jones of Liverpool. The foundation stone was laid on 28 August 1920, and the memorial was unveiled on 28 September 1921. This ceremony included a procession from the Town Hall led by the mayor and the 17th Earl of Derby. The memorial was paid for by public subscription which raised ¬£7,830, against a target of ¬£10,000. However the memorial cost only ¬£6,000, and the remainder was used as a social fund towards the poor of the town. An inscription and plaques were added to commemorate those lost in the Second World War, and these were unveiled in April 1950. In February 2015 Engraved stones were unveiled to honour 62 \\"forgotten\\" men who died in World War One, but were not listed on a Cheshire town's cenotaph. The new memorial in Victoria Park, Widnes, follows researcher Michael McNicholas spotting the omissions as he worked on a book about the war. Description The memorial consists of an obelisk in Portland stone standing on a stepped plinth in York stone. The obelisk is about high on a plinth about in height. Around the plinth are 30 bronze tablets inscribed with the names of the 818 men who died in the First World War. On the base of the obelisk is the coat of arms of Widnes. At the top of the obelisk is a flaming urn to symbolise immortality. The corners of the plinth are angled and contain carved laurel wreathes. Higher in the plinth are eight bronze tablets with the names of those lost in the Second World War. Towards the top of the obelisk on all four faces are crosses carved in relief. Below the crosses on the north and south sides are palm branches, and below those on the east and west sides are laurel wreathes. In a panel on the front (south) side of the plinth is an inscription reading as follows. On the same face, above the smaller plaques, is an inscription reading as follows. On the front of the base of the obelisk is an inscription reading: On the left (west) side the inscription reads: On the right side the inscription is: And at the back is inscribed: Appraisal The monument was designated as a Grade II listed building on 21 August 2007. Grade II is the lowest of the three grades of listing and is applied to \\"buildings of national importance and special interest\\".

Such temples were built by a number different cultures and are distributed across the world including in India, China, Egypt, Japan and Peru. Some of the temples are in ruins, undergoing excavation, preservation or restoration and a few are listed as World Heritage Sites individually or as part of a larger site, such as Konark. China West Holy Gate, Temple of the Sun (Beijing) The Temple of the Sun in Beijing, China, was built in 1530 during the Ming dynasty by the Jiajing Emperor, together with new temples dedicated to the Earth and the Moon, and an expansion of the Temple of Heaven. The Temple of the Sun was used by the imperial court for elaborate acts of worship involving fasting, prayers, dancing and animal sacrifices, as part of a year-long cycle of ceremonies involving all the temples. An important element was the colour red, which was associated with the Sun, including red utensils for food and wine offerings, and red clothes for the emperor to wear during the ceremonies. The temple is now part of a public park. Egypt A plan of Userkaf's temple In ancient Egypt, there were a number of sun temples. Among these old monuments is the Great Temple of Ramses at Abu Simbel, and complexes built by the Fifth Dynasty, of which only two examples survive, that of Userkaf and of Niuserre. The Fifth Dynasty temples usually had three components, a main temple building at a higher elevation, accessed by a causeway, from a much smaller entrance building. In 2006, archaeologists found ruins underneath a market in Cairo, which could possibly be the largest temple built by Ramesses II. Indian subcontinent The sun temples of the Indian subcontinent were dedicated to the Hindu deity Surya,with the most prominent among them being the Konark Sun Temple (also known as the Black Pagoda) at Konark in Odisha and the Sun Temple at Modhera, Gujarat, built in 1026‚Äì1027. Both are now ruins, having been destroyed by invading armies. Konark was constructed around 1250, by Narasimhadeva I of the Eastern Ganga Dynasty, and was built in the shape of a large chariot with carved stone wheels, pillars and walls. Surya was an important deity in early Hinduism, but largely ceased to be worshiped as a principal deity around the 12th century. In Manipuri mythology, the sun god Korouhanba is the synonym of the Hindu deity Surya. Other Surya or sun temples in the Indian subcontinent include: * Martand Sun Temple, near Anantnag in Jammu and Kashmir built in 10th century * Deo Surya Mandir in Deo, Bihar * Ebudhou Korouhanba Temple, Moidangpok, Patsoi, Manipur * Sun temple at Katharmal, near Almora and 70 km from Nainital was built in 9th century CE by the Katyuri kings. * Sun Temple at Modhera in Gujarat, built in 1027 by King Bhimdev of the Chaulukya dynasty * Bhramanya Dev Temple at Unao, Balaji in Madhya Pradesh * Sun Temple at Kalpi in Uttar Pradesh * Soorya Narayana Temple at Maroli, Mangalore, Karnataka * Surya Pahar Temple at Sri Surya Pahar in Assam built in 9th century * Suryanar Kovil Temple at Kumbakonam in Tamil Nadu built in 1060-1118 CE * Surya Narayana Temple at Arasavalli in Andhra Pradesh built in 7th century * Dakshinaarka Temple at Gaya in Bihar * Biranchinarayan Temple, Buguda in Buguda, Ganjam, Odisha. * Biranchinarayan Temple, Palia, a 13th-century temple in Palia, Odisha. * Multan Sun Temple, also known as Aditya Sun Temple, in Multan in Punjab, Pakistan was destroyed by Muslim rulers in 10th century. * Navlakha Temple, Ghumli, Gujarat, built in the 11th century. * Katarmal sun temple in Uttarakhand, built from approximately the 10th century onwards. * Birla Sun Temple in Gwalior * Sri Suryanarayana Swamy Temple, Gollalamamidada, in Andhra Pradesh built in 1920.

In 2014 he was martyred in Karachi by the Taliban. Aslam joined the Sindh Police force in 1987 as SHO (Station House Officer) and served in several police stations across Karachi and in Balochistan due to provincial allocation. Chaudhry Aslam gained fame after working as an encounter specialist from 1992-1994 and 1996-1997. Chaudhry was suspended and came back to service in 2004 and was given the task of eradicating target killers. Later he was ordered to lead the LTF (Lyari Task Force) and end the gangwar in Lyari Town. From 2005-2014 Chaudhry Aslam arrested terrorists, gangwar-criminals, target killers and extortionists belonging to TTP, BLA, MQM, ANP, TMP, LJ, LeT and SSP. On 9 January 2014, he was shaheed in a bomb blast carried out by Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan. In 2017 Kulbhushan Jadhav, an Indian national arrested in Balochistan on the allegations of spying and terrorism, confessed in a video released by DG ISPR that the assassination of Aslam was sponsored by Indian intelligence agency Research Analysis Wing on the directions of Anil Dhasmana. The validity of the video, however, has been criticised, with the Indian side claiming it to be doctored and forced upon Jadhav. Personal info He belonged to and was born in Dhodial, Mansehra District, Hazara Division and moved to Karachi along with his father after completing his primary education.  Career  In 2010, Aslam was appointed as head of the Investigation Wing in the Criminal Investigation Department. Aslam won himself a reputation for his performance in the 2012 'Lyari grand operation' which once again aimed at clearing the area of criminals.  2011 attack by Taliban  TTP attack on his residence in 2011 In 2011, he escaped unhurt from a Taliban attack on his house situated in the Defence Phase VIII area of Karachi. The attack resulted in the death of eight people. TTP claimed responsibility for the attack as retaliation for ongoing efforts against them, including the arrest and killing of many of the organisation's fighters. At that time, a defiant Aslam, whose home was half blown away by the blast, said he knew he was the target but it would not deter him from fighting against extremists.

The Mohmand Agency chapter of the banned Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) claimed responsibility for the attack. Sajjad Mohmand, a spokesman for the militant group, said Aslam was targeted for carrying out operations against the TTP. \\"Aslam was involved in killing Taliban prisoners in CID cells in Karachi and was on the top of our hit-list,\\" he said.

The company is the largest producer of chrome in the country and among the leading producers of ferrochrome in the world.  History  After the fall of communist regime in Albania, AlbChrome was reopened in the beginnings of 1991. In 2000, facilities such as mines, smelters, plants and factories, part of the chrome industry infrastructure in Albania, were given to a private company from the Government of Albania. The 'DARFO' group worked and exploited these concessionary assets until 2007, when an Austrio-Russian group took over the concession and formed a new company called \\"Albanian Chrome\\" (ACR). Under the Austrio-Russian industrial expertise, two out of three furnaces installed in Elbasan Ferrochrome Plant were refurbished and their technology was changed to provide for a higher performance and production. Also Bulqiza Mine experienced a reconstruction of the whole exploitation scheme. Important investments were done for security, exploration and ore processing fields, making the company more efficient. In 2009, ACR had a change in ownership, and DCM (Austrian investing group) took over 100% of the shares of the Concessionary Agreement, becoming the only shareholder of ACR. DCM continued to improve and implement new projects and ideas to further develop the company into a modern European industrial business with high perspective for the future. In 2013, due to difficulties in actualizing investments, DCM sold the whole shares of ACR to Balkan Finance Group, BALFIN, owned by Samir Mane. The actual engagement and future premises of this company (now named AlbChrome) proud part of BALFIN Group and all his representing structures are excellent so far. We are immediately and strongly working to renovate the technology used in smelters, increase safety investments in mines and implement new optimistic and courageous projects throughout all the assets with the final goal of increasing both productivity and quality of the operations and the products of the company. Based on a successful background and an optimistic feeling for the future, BALFIN Group is expecting to realize the most ambitious projects and investments ever developed in Albanian Industry and to guarantee prosperity and healthy environment in every part/asset of AlbChrome for more years to come. Today AlbChrome has more than 800 employees in Bulqiza, Elbasan, Tirana, Burrel and Klos and is involved in an intense revitalization. AlbChrome, with the support of Balfin Group has started 3 main investment projects: Traverbank in Klos - the railway tunnel that connects Bulqiza Mine with Enrichment Plant in Klos. Enrichment plant in Klos - it was never operative and now will be fully operative. The deepest well in Bulqiza Mine - this is considered from the experts the biggest investment in the mineral industry of the region and probably in Europe of the latest years. Opening the second furnace in Elbasan - now that the second furnace become operative the production of Ferr-Chrome in Albania is doubled.  Facilities  Bulqiza Mine The Bulqiza mine is one of the largest and richest area with chromium in Albania operating up to 800 metres. About 630 employers Bulqiza mine, part of AlbChrome operates in five levels. Actually from our mine in Bulqiza is extracted about 54'000 tons of chrome mineral per year and it is aimed that after the investment it has started to extract up to 100,000 tones. With the opening of the Well Number 9 it will be added 6 new levels to the mine deeper reaching over 1'500'000 tons of other reserves which prolong the life of the mine. As part of the mine of Bulqiza is the sector of Qafe Buall which is expected to be operational and have an output of more than 40,000 tones of chrome mineral per year. Ferro-Chrome factory of Elbasan Ferro-Chrome factory of Elbasan started to operate in 1989. It is designed to produce high-carbon ferrochrome using as raw chromium material coming from the mines in the country, mainly from Bulqiza area. Currently Ferro-Chrome Factory of Elbasan works with two furnaces for the production of high-carbon ferrochrome. One of the furnaces was recently introduced into production, in early May 2013, after an investment of Balfin Group. Current production capacity is about 33'000 tons of ferrochrome per year.http://www.monitor.al/dyfishohet-prodhimi-i- ferro-kromit-ne-vend/ This product is entirely destined for export, mainly to the markets of developed industrial countries in Europe, Asia and America. Ferro Chrome Plant of Burrel Built in 1979, is one of the first investments in minerals industry in Albania and very close to the place of chrome mining. The plant covers an area of 14 hectares, has three electric furnaces with 9 MW installing power and situated 7 kilometers from the town of Burrel. The main units of Ferro Chrome Plant of Burrel are the melting unit, electromechanical unit, internal transportation and services units. Chrome mineral that is used in melting power plants, is supplied from the mines of the country, mainly from the chrome-holding basin of Bulqize. The final and only product of the Ferro Chrome factory in Burrel is ferro-chrome with high carbon content (C= 6‚Äì8 %), whereas the chrome in ferro-chrome is Cr=60-65 % (base 63%). Enrichment Plant of Klos Built more than 25 years ago, this plant is the only one of its kind in Albania and serves to enrich that part of the mineral inferred in the mine which is of poor quality. Once enriched the mineral may be suitable for melting in furnaces of Ferro-Chrome Factory of Elbasan. Currently the Enrichment Plant of Klos is subject to a general intervention to become again operational. Renewal of equipments is performed by Swedish engineers who are part of the company that also built it many years ago. Chromium enrichment plant will enable the collection of low quality mineral from all mines of Albania and the region.  Products  The chromium ore of Bulqiza Mine is a ready-to-sell product, but also the primary raw material for our metallurgic Plant of Elbasan producing high-carbon Ferro ‚Äì Chrome. The quality of the Chrome ore product is of 40% Cr2O3 The exploitation system in our Bulqiza Mine is that of \\"sub-floors\\" and the ore body thickness in the richest area of the Mine can mount up to 3‚Äì4 m. this gives high hopes for the product quality and quantity. The chrome ore comes out of the underground and then undergoes a series of selecting processes. It is finally divided in ore fractions. About 40% of the initial product is + 70 mm fraction, leaving around 20% as 20‚Äì70 mm fraction and the rest is 0‚Äì20 mm fraction. These fractions are used differently in different parts of the mining industry. But mainly they are used for the metallurgic smelters that produce Ferro-Chrome and other chrome alloys FERRO-CHROME The final product of the Elbasan Plant is Ferro ‚Äì Chrome. This represents an alloy, a mixture of iron and chrome ore, with a 6 ‚Äì 8.5% of carbon compound, making the product a high-carbon Ferro- Chrome. Ferro-Chrome is an output of melting chrome ore in hi-tech furnaces, with alternative current. Other elements composing the charge are the reducing compound (Coke) and fluxes (waste forming). A typical view of the final product composition would be: * Chromium (typical): 65% - 70% * Silicon (typical): 0.5% - 1.5% * Carbon (typical): 8% * Sulfur (typical): 0.05% * Phosphorus (typical): 0.010% - 0.03% * Titanium (typical): 0.01% - 0.05% The Ferro ‚Äì Chrome Plant of Elbasan has actually two furnaces at work, both producing high-carbon Ferro ‚Äì Chrome. One of the furnaces was refurbished and restarted production on May 2013, under the management of Balfin Group. The actual production capacities are about 33.000 tons of Ferro-Chrome, which is totally destined to be exported. Actually, Albchrome exports its Ferro-chrome in the most industrially developed economies, in Europe, Asia and The Americas. The product is sold in fractions, crushed according to the market needs. The most wanted fractions for the time being are: 10‚Äì50 mm. 50‚Äì80 mm but an escalating market need has risen for the 5‚Äì10 mm fraction, as well.

He founded the Yamhad dynasty which controlled northern Syria throughout the 17th and 18th centuries BC. Reign Although Sumu-Epuh's early life or the way he ascended the throne is not known, he is considered the first king of Yamhad, and his realm included Alalakh and Tuba. Sumu-Epuh entered the historical records when he was mentioned by Yahdun-Lim of Mari, as one of the leaders who fought against him. Yahdun-Lim was an ambitious ruler who campaigned in the north claiming to have reached the Mediterranean, in spite of having a dynastic alliance with Yamhad to oppose Assyria. Those campaigns caused Sumu-Epuh to support the Yaminite tribes centered at Tuttul against the Mariote king, who emerged victorious but was soon killed by his own son. Yahdun-Lim's death was followed by Shamshi-Adad I of Assyria's conquest of Mari. =War Against Assyria= Sumu-Epuh aided by Khashshum attacked a kingdom in Zalmakum (a marshy region between the Euphrates and lower Balikh). Khashshum later shifted alliance and joined Shamshi-Adad, who surrounded Yamhad by alliances with the city of Urshu and king Aplahanda of Charchemish in the north, and by conquering Mari in the east (after the death of Yahdun-Lim) in c. 1796 BC, and installing his son Yasmah-Adad on its throne. Shamshi-Adad then concluded an alliance with Yamhad's rival to south Qatna, by marrying his son Yashmah-Adad to princess Beltum, the daughter of Ishi-Addu, king of Qatna. Sumu-Epuh welcomed Zimri-Lim the heir of Mari who fled to Yamhad, in hope that he might be useful some day since in the eyes of the people of Mari, Zimri-Lim was the legitimate king. Shamshi-Adad's coalition attacked Aleppo but failed to take the city. Sumu-Epuh allied himself with the tribes of the Suteans and the Turukkaeans, who attacked the Assyrian king from the east and the south. Sumu-Epuh also conquered the Assyrian fortress Dur-Shamshi-Adad and renamed it Dur-Sumu-Epuh. =Death and Legacy= Sumu-Epuh apparently was killed in c. 1780 BC during his fight with Shamshi-Adad, His successor was Yarim-Lim I, his son by his queen Sumunna-Abi. The dynasty of Sumu-Epuh continued to hold power in the Levant until c. 1344 BC.

Early years Adolphe Augustin Marie Billault was born on 12 November 1805 in Vannes, Morbihan, to an obscure family. As a young lawyer he asked for the hand of a rich heiress, Fran√ßoise Bourgault-Ducoudray. He told his prospective father-in-law, Guillaume Bourgault-Ducoudray, that he had little money and no reputation, but in three years would be the leading lawyer in Nantes, in another three years would be a national representative, and three years later would be a minister. Impressed by his determination, the young woman accepted him. He kept his word. By 1830 he was a municipal Councillor in Nantes. He became President of the Bar of his order, and member of the General Council of the Loire-Inf√©rieure. National deputy Billault was elected deputy on 4 November 1837 for the constituency of the Lower Loire (Aucenis), taking his seat on the left and voting with the opposition. As a lawyer he became the adviser of the Duke of Aumale. He was reelected on 2 March 1839 and accepted the position of Deputy Secretary of State of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, under the minister Alexandre Go√ºin. By 1838 he was a member and secretary of the Railway Commission. When the cabinet retired on 1 March 1838 Billaut returned to the opposition. Billault was reelected on 9 July 1842 and on 1 August 1846. He continued to often vote with the opposition to the dynasty, while at times agreeing with the government. After the February Revolution of 1848 he was elected on 23 April 1848 to represent Loire-Inf√©rieure. He declared himself Republican and voted with the party led by Louis-Eug√®ne Cavaignac. However, he began to drift towards the right. He failed to be reelected, but became active in the extra-parliamentary cabals that were to decide the fate of the Republic. Bonapartist Billault in his uniform as a minister After coming to fully agree with the policy of Louis-Napol√©on Bonaparte, Billault became a frequent visitor to the √âlys√©e Palace. On the retirement of L√©on Faucher he was almost given the task of forming a ministry, but could not create a working combination. Billault was an official government candidate in the election of 29 February 1852, where he was returned as deputy for the 2nd district of Ari√®ge. Louis-Napol√©on named him president of the legislature. In this role, on 1 December 1852 Billault went to the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud to bring the results of a plebiscite which had voted in favor of restoring the empire, with Louis-Napol√©on as the Emperor Napoleon III. The Emperor appointed Billault Minister of the Interior on 19 June 1854, and made him a senator on 4 December 1854. He remained in office until the crisis caused by the assassination attempt by Felice Orsini, when he was replaced by General Charles-Marie-Esprit Espinasse on 8 February 1858. When Napoleon III tried to inaugurate the liberal empire on 24 November 1860, he called on Billault to serve as minister without portfolio. In this role, Billault acted as an eloquent defender of imperial policy. The stress of the job damaged his health. Billault died prematurely at Nantes, Lower Loire, on 13 October 1863. The city of Nantes erected a statue of Billault in 1867.

He served as vice-chairman of the legislative affairs commission of the National People's Congress Standing Committee becoming 10th vice-chairman of the Law Committee in 2003.

In April 2010, Qiao said the reason the Standing Committee in 2007 ruled that Hong Kong \\"may\\" and not \\"must\\" have universal suffrage for the 2017 chief executive and 2020 Legislative Council elections was because any change in electoral methods required approval by local lawmakers. He added that passage of the reform package would \\"create excellent conditions for universal suffrage in the future.\\"Lee, Colleen (15 April 2010) \\"Qiao adds clout to reforms\\" , The Standard Instead of equal and universal right to vote, in June 2010 he further defined universal suffrage with the restriction of taking into consideration Hong Kong‚Äôs legal status (as a non-independent state), being compatible with the executive-led political system, balancing the interests of different sectors of society, and being beneficial for the development of the city‚Äôs capitalist economy. Pan-democrats said Qiao's statement reinforced their concerns, as it offered only the right to vote rather than to stand and nominate others in an election, and paved the way for keeping functional constituencies indefinitely. On 24 March 2013, he stated that Chief Executive \\"candidates must be persons who love the country and love Hong Kong\\". He admitted that it would be difficult to define, but implied that the pan- democrats were unpatriotic, he said: \\"As long as they insist on confronting the central government, they cannot become the chief executive.\\" He also mentioned in his speech that ‚Äúthe nominating committee is in fact an organisation. The nomination of CE candidates by the nominating committee is a form of organisational nomination, which could effectively screen out pro- democracy candidates when pro-Beijing camp have the majority in the nominating committee.

Purchased in 1998 by the National Trust, the previous structure was demolished, and the present building constructed to the style of the old coastguard station and opened as a visitor and interpretation centre.  Site  The village of Robin Hood's Bay (known locally as Baytown) is situated on the north side of a wide sweeping bay about south of Whitby on the North Yorkshire coast of England. Baytown rests on mud banks that cover layers of limestone and blue shale. At low tide long rocky scaurs can be seen and there is an abundance of fossils to be found. Originating in the early 16th century, the village rapidly became one of the most important fishing centres on the Yorkshire coast, reaching its zenith in the mid-19th century, before its rapid decline following the introduction of steam power. The coming of the railway in 1885 and the consequent influx of tourists and visitors, compensated for the decline of the local fishing industry. The village is a mixture of four storey town houses and split-level cottages, on a very steep three-in-one hill leading down to an area known as the Dock and the Wayfoot on the edge of the sea.  History  In 1907 Walter Garstang was appointed professor of zoology at the University of Leeds. Recognised as one of the country's leading marine scientists, Garstang had been assistant director of the Plymouth Laboratory of the Marine Biological Association of the United Kingdom, and in charge of the association's Lowestoft Laboratory while directing Great Britain's part in the International Fishery Investigations of the North Sea. Walter Garstang first visited Robin Hood's Bay at Easter in 1909, with T.H. Taylor, his assistant lecturer and demonstrator in zoology, and Ll. Lloyd, his first advanced student (and later to be his reader in entomology and protozoology). Ll. Lloyd, who had known the area since boyhood, later recalled that they stayed at the Bay Hotel \\"and its verandha, the sea washing its wall at high tide, was our Laboratory\\" where they sorted and examined the great variety of animals collected from the shore and rock pools. In 1912, in cooperation with Alfred Denny, professor of zoology at Sheffield University, Walter Garstang established a marine research facility in Baytown, in an old building at the Wayfoot previously used as the coastguard cottage, and owned by Mrs. Martha Storm, a member of the long-established local fishing family. Jointly funded by Leeds and Sheffield Universities, the facility was known as Yorkshire Universities Marine Laboratory, and was used as a summer base for fieldwork, teaching and research by the Departments of Zoology and Botany. Initially for a two-year trial period, the two universities agreed to the annual outlay of ¬£4 each for rent and up to ¬£10 each for upkeep. The minutes of the Faculty of Pure Science of the University of Sheffield on 12 March 1912 University of Sheffield. Minutes and Reports of the Faculty of Pure Science, 1912 record the following resolution that was carried unanimously: That the Faculty approves of the proposal to extend the work of the Department of Zoology by co- operating with the University of Leeds in establishing a small marine Zoological Laboratory at Robin Hood's Bay. The Report of the Faculty of Pure Science,University of Sheffield. Reports of the Faculty of Pure Science, 1912‚Äì1913 for 1912‚Äì1913 stated that: In 1914 they agreed to continue the arrangement and to rent for a further ¬£3 annually the adjoining large room, previously occupied by an auctioneer, and formerly being the coastguards' rocket apparatus room. In agreeing to the expansion, the Leeds University Finance Committee suggested that any funds required for additional equipment should be raised by private subscription. Walter Garstang was confident that he could acquire the necessary funds. Martha Storm had been willing to sell the premises in 1914, but it was not until 1922 that the buildings were jointly purchased by Leeds and Sheffield for the sum of ¬£220. There were very few permanent facilities at the laboratory, so when the classes travelled over from Leeds and Sheffield they had to bring all the equipment they needed with them and carry it down from the top of Bay Bank. In 1912 the young Lionel (Leo) Walmsley, son of the local artist J. Ulric Walmsley, and later to become a well-known novelist, secured the post of curator-caretaker of the lab at five shillings a week. There were no specified hours attached to the post and this allowed him to continue working as an uncertified assistant teacher at the local school.  Literary references  In his autobiography So many loves (1944) dedicated \\"To Sam\\", Leo Walmsley describes the laboratory, shore collecting and life with the students and researchers. In the autumn of 1912 S.E. Wilson B.Sc. arrived at the laboratory. A University of Sheffield post- graduate researcher who had recently been appointed Assistant Curator of the Zoological Museum, Sam Wilson was studying a parasitic crustacean (listed by Walmsley as \\"Spanknotrophus\\") and its nudibranch host Doto coronata. He became Walmsley's mentor and lifelong friend, encouraging him to study and to write. In Walmsley's words: And: Alfred Denny retired in 1925 and Sheffield's interest in the laboratory lapsed. The University of Sheffield withdrew their support in 1928, the minutes of the 25 May 1928 meeting of the Faculty of Pure ScienceUniversity of Sheffield. Minutes and of the Faculty of Pure Science, 1928. recording: However, generations of Leeds students and researchers, and visiting marine scientists, benefited from working in Robin Hood's Bay. Walter Garstang retired in 1933, but the laboratory continued to operate along the lines established. In Garstang's obituary notice in 1949 in Nature, Professor L. Eastham, a former pupil, wrote: He was succeeded by E.A. Spaul, who was professor of zoology from 1933 to 1960, though during this period marine research was not a Leeds priority. The building was gradually improved with much \\"do it yourself\\" work; more benches were added, together with electric points, and better domestic facilities in the living area. At the start of World War II the building was taken over by the army and the seaward end of the building, suitably armed, formed part of the country's anti-invasion defences for the next five years.  1950s  By 1955 the living accommodation had been largely taken over for laboratory space and it was possible to squeeze up to 40 or 50 students into the various rooms. The laboratory continued to serve mainly as a base for undergraduate field courses, and local cottages were rented and shared by students (segregated into same-sex groups). The laboratory was also rented out to parties from other educational institutions and was in constant use for much of each summer. The 1960s saw the beginning of a period of expansion in marine scientific and environmental research, and J.M. Dodd, Eric Spaul's successor at Leeds, obtained financial support from the Wellcome Trust. Dodd was formerly director of the Gatty Marine Laboratory of the University of St. Andrews and his interests in elasmobranch endocrinology formed a basis for his approach to the Wellcome Trust. The original plan was that the existing buildings would be modernised, but on examination by the builders it was declared that the old buildings would not stand up to the work, and so they were razed to the ground. Fiercely opposed by local residents, including, ironically, Leo Walmsley the now successful novelist, the university won in the name of science. The Wellcome Marine Laboratory was built on the site and although the architects claimed (as architects do) that their design would blend in with nearby buildings, the outcome was an architectural mistake. The new laboratory was formally opened in April 1967 by Sir John Orr, of the Wellcome Trust at a ceremony attended by a number of local dignitaries and the vice-chancellor of Leeds University. Dr J.R. (Jack) Lewis took up post as senior lecturer-in-charge. The building subsequently received an award for its design from the Royal Institute of British Architects (RIBA). The facilities at the new laboratory were far superior to its predecessor and it had an underfloor reservoir of seawater that was pumped to all parts of the building. It was soon found, however, that the laboratory could not provide sufficient accommodation for the increasing numbers of staff, students and visiting scientists. Fortunately a local bequest made it possible to buy and convert the Old School House at the top of Fisherhead into a hostel for visiting scientists. The hostel also housed the laboratory's library for some time, and was renamed Wright House, after its benefactor. The laboratory subscribed to a number of specialised journals not taken by the main university library, and older books from that library were transferred to the library in Baytown. As there were only about twelve staff at any one time, the library was run on trust and staff signed out any items borrowed. Later Leeds University purchased a house adjacent to the Laboratory and the library was moved to this new location. Despite the controversy over the design of the building, the staff at the laboratory enjoyed friendly relations with the residents of Baytown. Some staff purchased property in the village and their wives taught in the local Fylingdales School. A local fisherman was recruited to look after the laboratory's boat that was based in Whitby. The boat was a modern version of a coble. When not required for sea excursions, the fisherman was usefully employed as an odd job man around the laboratory. A local lady was employed as a caretaker for the hostel, and another as a cleaner at the laboratory. The only conflict came about with a neighbour living behind the laboratory who ran a guest house, and who periodically complained about the noise. This problem was resolved when the lady moved to another property in the village.  Construction  There were some problems experienced with the building itself over the years. The sandstone from which it was built was not sufficiently durable to withstand the local elements. At high tide the whole building vibrated and the sea came right up the slipway so that the front door could not be used. One remedial measure taken was to coat the sandstone in silicone. In 1971, during a very severe winter, high and rough seas scoured away the slipway and the foundations of the marine laboratory. In between tides emergency repairs were attempted by filling up the hole with sandbags and rocks, which the following tide demolished with contempt. It was only when the weather improved that diggers and earth movers could be used to build up a permanent base and allow the relaying of the cobbles. Originally it had been anticipated that staff and research students based in Leeds would make regular use of the facilities, but partly because of the laboratory's ability to supply live animals to seawater tanks in Leeds, use declined. In effect what had been regarded as an extension of the Zoology Department on the coast acquired its own identity with distinctive research interests. In 1972 the laboratory became a separate unit of the Faculty of Science, independent of the Zoology Department, with Jack Lewis as director. At that time it had a permanent staff of two zoologists, three research assistants and two technicians, with a small library, and a boatman with a coble, Njord. Living and preserved specimens were supplied, and additional laboratory space and facilities were available for students, with living accommodation for up to four visiting workers. The creation by the university of the post-doctoral Garstang Research Fellowship added to the resident scientific staff. In 1973 the possibilities were examined of developing the nearby site formerly occupied by the gasworks, notable as being the smallest gasworks in Yorkshire, but no further action was taken. The director, with a succession of gifted research students, research assistants, and visiting workers, made intensive and continuous studies of rocky shore and marine benthic ecology, including some baseline environmental and pollution studies under contract. Work by the lecturer and later deputy director, John Gray who was at the laboratory from 1965 to 1976 and was to become a major figure in international marine scientific research, is an example. From 1978 a much-expanded programme of research was funded by the Natural Environment Research Council. The work was concerned with the natural recruitment variability of selected common species around the British Isles, and it led in 1979 to a major European project (COST 47) as part of the EEC Environment Programme. Despite the high reputation of the Robin Hood's Bay Laboratory in terms of the quality and quantity of its research output and teaching programme, Leeds University reluctantly terminated its existence in December 1982 as part of the policy of general cutbacks forced upon British science by the government. Jack Lewis took early retirement after arranging for most of the research team to move up the coast to Cullercoats, to continue their work in Newcastle University's Dove Marine Laboratory.  Current structure  For a while the building remained empty, and then it was sold at a drastically reduced price. The university was pleased with the sale because the new owners proposed to use the building as a natural history educational establishment, and so it would remain in the education sector. It was described as a marine activity centre and was mainly used by parties of canoeists and scuba divers. In 1998 the building was bought by the National Trust and rebuilt in the style of the earlier coastguard station, becoming a visitor centre operated jointly by the National Trust and the North York Moors National Park Authority, and with holiday accommodation on the second floor.

Born in Barcelona, he began his career in writing in 1955, and wrote novels and poetry in both Catalan and Spanish. His final novel was published in 2012. He played an outstanding role in the Spanish and Catalan culture life of the second half of the 20th century. He was the chief editor of the publishing house Edicions 62 (1964‚Äì1996) and afterwards president of the Grup 62. He was the founder and first president of the Associaci√≥ d'Escriptors en Llengua Catalana (Catalan writers association), a board member of the Comunit√† europea degli scrittori, the Prix international de Litt√©rature jury and the dean of the Instituci√≥ de les Lletres Catalanes (Institution of Catalan letters). Josep Maria Castellet died on 9 January 2014, aged 87, in his hometown of Barcelona.  Biography  Castellet received his education as a literary critic by working for university magazines. His biographers stress his active participation in the editorial board of the magazine Laye (1950‚Äì1954), where he held a critical position towards contemporary Spanish literature, and the first publication of an article collection Notas sobre literatura espa√±ola contempor√°nea (Notes on contemporary Spanish literature, 1955). His willingness for renewal and the discovery of the European literary critique through the Laye group led him to write La hora del lector (The reader's hour, 1957). As he wanted to make known a group of young poets that had started publishing in Laye (Carlos Barral, Jaime Gil de Biedma and Jos√© Agust√≠n Goytisolo), he published the polemic anthology Veinte a√±os de poes√≠a espa√±ola (20 years of Spanish poetry, 1960) that postulated historic realism. Ten years later a new anthology, Nueve nov√≠simos poetas espa√±oles (Nine brand-new Spanish poets, 1970), marked a change to new poetic tendencies after realism. In 1963 Castellet published, together with Joaquim Molas, Poesia catalana del segle XX (20th century Catalan poetry) guided by historic realism, a concept that he developed theoretically in Poesia, realisme, hist√≤ria (Poetry, realism, history, 1965). His work as a critic during that time centered on two important books that are still considered works of reference: the structuralist reading of the poetry by Espriu ‚ÄîIniciaci√≥ a la poesia de Salvador Espriu (Initiation to Salvador Espriu's poetry, 1971)‚Äî and the analysis of the narrative richness of Josep Pla's work, Josep Pla o la ra√≥ narrativa (Josep Pla or narrative reason, 1978). In Per un debat sobre la cultura a Catalunya (For a debate on culture in Catalonia, 1983) he reflected on the role of culture in the recently democratic state and the frame of the autonomous region of Catalonia. His last works consisted of memories; the first one, not published until 2007 was Dietari de 1973 (Diary of 1973). He started this presentation of himself and his times in Els escenaris de la mem√≤ria (Memory's stages,1988), went on with Seductors, il¬∑lustrats i visionaris (Seducers, enlightened and visionaries, 2009) and Mem√≤ries confidencials d'un editor.

It began in 996, when the people, led by an ordinary sailor named 'Allaqa, rose up against the Fatimid government. The Fatimid caliph al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah sent his army and navy to retake the city under Abu Abdallah al-Husayn ibn Nasr al-Dawla and the freedman Yaqut. Based in the nearby cities of Tripoli and Sidon, the Fatimid forces blockaded Tyre by land and sea for two years, during which a Byzantine squadron's attempt to reinforce the defenders was repulsed by the Fatimid navy with heavy losses.

Background He was a son of John Gage and his wife Joan, heiress of John Sudgrove of Sudgrove, Gloucestershire. The marriage of his parents appears in a pedigree that was compiled in 1627 from family deeds by Richard Hoskins of the Inner Temple. In 1416-7, John Sudgrove settled his lands at Miserden and Sudgrove on John and Joan Gage and Alice, his other daughter, with her husband John Bovey. Joan survived her husband and on 10 August 1438, she and her son John conveyed their lands in Cirencester, Nether Siddington, Miserden and Brimsfield to trustees. That transaction may have taken place in connection with the marriage of John the son. Marriage and family John married Eleanor, a daughter of Thomas St Clere and his wife Margaret Hoo. As Sir Thomas had no son, his three daughters were co-heirs to the extensive properties that he held at the time of his death in 1435.Calendar of Inquisitions Miscellaneous, Vol. 8, Nos. 114‚Äì117. Sir John and Eleanor were the parents of: * William Gage * John Gage In December 1445, the properties formerly held by Thomas St Clere were released from the King's hands into which they had been taken, despite Sir Thomas' attempts to deprive the King of his rights over the property and control of the marriages of its heiresses. By that stage, all three of Sir Thomas' daughters were married.Calendar of Patent Rolls, Reign of Henry VI, Vol. 4, page 443. A deed dated 8 July 1446 set out the agreed partition of Sir Thomas' lands between his three daughters and their husbands.

The orders confirmed that Sir John had survived his wife and after her death held her lands for his own lifetime by courtesy of England.Calendar of Fine Rolls, Vol. 21, No. 322 Various accounts, in Burke's Peerage and elsewhere, report the year of Sir John's death as 1486.

(Preview only; subscription required to view full article)  History  The INN was founded as a single soup kitchen in Hempstead, NY in 1983 by a small group of volunteers who were concerned about the state of hunger on Long Island. The main proponent of this first soup was Patricia O'Connor, a mother of nine, and Michael Moran, then a Chaplain at Hofstra University.Alfano, Peter (17 July 1983). ‚ÄúA Gift for the Needy: Lunch‚Äù.

Jean Kelly was one of the thirty who responded to that initial call and now resides as the Executive Director of The INN. As success of the first soup kitchen spread through word of mouth, other Long Islanders became passionate about opening more soup kitchens in their own towns. From its inception, The INN has relied on interfaith communities and connections and remains unbiased towards religion, race or ethnicity. In 1984, volunteers realized that hunger wasn't the only problem they could strive to fix, but that homelessness needed attention, too. The INN responded to this problem by opening its first emergency shelter. It subsequently developed into a comprehensive organization that could aid the hungry and homeless throughout Long Island in a variety of ways. As of 2013 the INN operates 14 soup kitchens, three emergency shelters, and one long-term housing program.

It is owned by Merton Council, but is managed by the London Wildlife Trust. History Mill Corner In the Middle Ages Beverley Meads was owned by Merton Abbey, from which period the two ponds in Fishpond Wood are believed to date. It is likely that the watermill at Mill Corner on Beverley Brook dated from the medieval period: it was a fulling mill and is believed to have burnt down in the Tudor period. At that period the meads covered the area, since pollen analysis from the ponds indicates that the surrounding woodland developed only after the mill's demise. After the Reformation and the dissolution of Merton Abbey in 1538, the meads continued to be farmed, and was owned by Warren Farm until shortly after the Second World War. The 'ponds' themselves are curious, for, while they may have been connected to the medieval watermill nearby, they only appear on maps from the early nineteenth century onwards. That said, since the area was described as 'waste' (common-land) in the Wimbledon Manorial Rolls of 1763, it is possible that they were never viewed as worthy of recording. In the 1950s it was acquired by Wimbledon Council for public recreation and the medieval ponds drained. In the 1970s, after Wimbledon Council was subsumed by Merton Council, it was laid out to become a pitch and putt course, which introduced foreign soil and severely damaged the once pervasive acid grassland, before being abandoned in 1981. In the 1980s it was partly restored by the London Wildlife Trust, with the northern pond desilted in 1989 and its breaches repaired in 1992, such that it retains water throughout most of the year. In 1993, the area became a local nature reserve. Nature=Fishpond Wood= One of the Fishponds Fishpond Wood lies adjacent to Warren Farm, and its wetlands are surrounded by old oak-hazel woodland. Around half of the hazel trees in the wood have been managed by coppicing again, although recent regeneration has been poorer, possibly owing to increasing numbers of [rabbitrabbits and the arrival of muntjac deer. The ponds support a range of amphibians, including frogs (numbering around a thousand), toads and newts, as well as dragonflies and damselflies during the summer months. A broader variety of fauna live within the wood, including wood mice, bank and short-tailed voles, common and pygmy shrews, and weasels as well as foxes, rabbits and grey squirrels, and, more rarely, pipistrelle bats. Bird life is also abundant and includes lesser and greater spotted and green woodpeckers, tree-creeper and redwings during winter, while mallards, moorhens and occasionally mandarin ducks have bred nearby. =Beverley Meads= One of the Meads Beverley Meads was used as grazing land before the War, but the four meadows ('meads') are now mostly overgrown and encroached by scrub. The remnants of the old meadows provide acid grassland, which is a rare habitat in London and important for wildlife, especially grassland butterflies. The encroachment is being battled, and scrub pushed back to encourage this grassland to recover. Local butterflies include large, Essex and small skippers, small coppers, common blues, commas, meadow browns and small heaths. As with the Wood, there is a broader range of bird life, including: green woodpeckers; blue, great, and long-tailed tits; blackcaps; and bullfinchs. There is access to the site by footpaths from Wimbledon Common, from Barham Road via the rugby club, and from Robin Hood Way opposite Coombe Hill Road.

Founded in 2005, the company develops nuclear and particle accelerator technologies for application in medicine, defense and energy. Phoenix has held contracts with the U.S. Army, the U.S. Department of Energy, the U.S. Department of Defense and the U.S. Air Force. Phoenix developed a proprietary gas target neutron generator technology and has designed and built a number of particle accelerator-related technologies. Corporate history Phoenix Nuclear Labs was founded in 2005 by Dr. Gregory Piefer after he completed his PhD in Nuclear Engineering from the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Dr. Ross Radel, who joined the company in 2010, became the company president in July 2011. Retired Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt is on the company's scientific advisory board. In February 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs signed its first commercial contract to build a thermal neutron generation system for Ultra Electronics' Nuclear Control Systems, a British company that specializes in defense and security, transport and energy. In April 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs was awarded $1 million from the U.S. Department of Energy to design a high-current negative hydrogen ion source under the SBIR Phase II project. In August 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs and SHINE Medical Technologies successfully operated the second-generation neutron driver prototype for 24 consecutive hours with a 99% uptime. The test was said to be a key milestone towards the production of medical isotopes such as molybdenum-99. SHINE plans to start production at a facility in Janesville, WI in 2017. In October 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs announced that it was awarded a $3 million contract by the U.S. Army to develop an advanced neutron radiography imaging system. The second- generation version will be sent to Picatinny Arsenal, a military facility in New Jersey, as an upgrade to one they sent in 2013. Products In October 2012, Phoenix Nuclear Labs received two contracts from the U.S. Army. The first contract was a $879,000 Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II grant to help the company construct a high-flux neutron generator for the purpose of sensing improvised explosive devices (IED). The second contract was a $100,000 SBIR Phase I grant to design a neutron source for White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. This source would be used to test the radiation resistance of military equipment and equipment to be exposed to radiation in space as an alternative to current testing methods that use highly enriched uranium. In May 2012, the company had also raised funds to develop the neutron generator. In 2014, Phoenix Nuclear Labs also announced a successful preliminary test on the detection of 'undetectable explosives', by sensing the explosives materials instead of metal components. =Medical isotope production= Phoenix Nuclear Labs developed a proprietary gas target neutron generator technology and has designed and built a number of particle accelerator-related technologies. It has the technology to produce 3√ó1011 neutrons per second with the deuterium-deuterium fusion reaction. This can be sustained for a 24-hour period. Their spin-off company, SHINE Medical Technologies plans to open a facility for the mass production of Mo-99, an isotope used for medical care. Molybdenum decays into technetium-99m, which is used in over 40,000 medical imaging procedures everyday in the US. Over 80% of nuclear medicine procedures rely on molybdenum to detect cancer and diagnose heart disease, among hundreds of other procedures utilizing this isotope. The U.S. obtains all of its molybdenum (representing about half of global demand) from the aging nuclear reactors outside of the U.S. However, many of these reactors are scheduled to be shut down and they furthermore utilize highly enriched uranium (HEU), which the US considers a nuclear weapons proliferation threat. To avoid the security concern of HEU, the accelerator-driven, low- enriched uranium (LEU) solution becomes the target for high-efficiency isotope production. The neutrons generated by the PNL neutron generator drive fission in a subcritical LEU solution. The LEU solution is irradiated for approximately a week and medical isotopes are then extracted from the solution, purified using established techniques and packaged for sale. The LEU solution is then recycled, achieving extremely efficient use of uranium and producing much less waste than current molybdenum production methods. The company's neutron generators have been demonstrated to achieve over 1,000 hours of operation. The process produces medical isotopes that fit into existing supply chains while eliminating the use of weapons-grade uranium and reliance on aging nuclear reactors. For example, the Canadian National Research Universal reactor (NRU) in Chalk River, Ontario currently produces these medical isotopes. In 2006, it produced two-thirds of the world's technetium-99m. A 2009 shutdown of the NRU threatened to delay medical tests for cancer patients. Prior to the 2009 shutdown the NRU produced nearly half of the world's supply of medical isotopes.

NCS career advisers are responsible for the running of Armed Forces Careers Offices, providing career advice to potential recruits and managing their applications. When required, regular and reserve ranks and rates can be temporarily assigned to the service. The Naval Careers Service processes applications to the Royal Navy (both Regular and Reserve), the Royal Marines and the Royal Fleet Auxiliary.  Organisation  The Naval Careers Service (NCS) was formed on 1 April 1963 when the Naval Recruiting Service was renamed. It is one of the four components of Her Majesty's Naval Service ‚Äì alongside the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines and the Reserve Naval and Marine Forces ‚Äì and is governed by the Admiralty Board of the Defence Council. The service is led by the Captain of Naval Recruiting. The service's personnel consist of former Royal Navy, Royal Naval Reserve, Royal Marines and Royal Marines Reserve warrant officers, sergeants and petty officers. These personnel hold the named title of career adviser in the NCS of which there are three ranks ‚Äì CA3, CA2, CA1 (in order of ascending seniority). Personnel wear the uniform conforming to the rank or rate they held in their regular service, with the addition of the NCS badge. Careers advisers are typically assigned to one of the 53 Armed Forces Careers Offices. NCS members are subject to the Queen's Regulations, service law and the provisions of the Armed Forces Act 2006. Service members are classed as Full Time Reserve Service (FTRS) under the Reserve Forces Act 1996 and are subject to call-out (mobilisation) in addition to any liability they have as ex-regular service personnel (as recall reserve). NCS members are also entitled to the Volunteer Reserves Service Medal. The NCS is by far the smallest of the four components of the Naval Service: in September 2017 it amounted to 180 full-time trained personnel. The Royal Navy had a strength of around 22,500 regular personnel and the Royal Marines around 6,600. The combined Royal Navy and Royal Marine reserves amounted to around 2,700 personnel.  Entry  Applicants are only accepted as direct entrants from the other components of the Naval Service. They must have 12 years service and have held the minimum rank of petty officer (or sergeant in the Royal Marines) for at least two years. Applications may be made whilst serving in the regular forces or within two years of leaving (extended to five years where applicants entered the reserve forces upon end of regular service). The maximum age on entry is 52 and the normal retirement age is 55, which may be extended in exceptional circumstances to 60 years. Additionally all entrant must have a clean driving licence, no unspent convictions and pass medical fitness checks. New entrants are always assigned to the CA3 rank, regardless of previous rank. Initial training is carried out at the Royal Navy School of Recruiting in Bovington. Progression is via promotion boards specific to the NCS. Additionally regular and reserve officers and ratings can be temporarily assigned to the service. Such personnel are generally required to be over 30, present a good image and able to communicate with potential recruits and their parents. These personnel typically serve in an Armed Forces Careers Office, a Royal Navy Careers Information Office, an Officer Careers Liaison Centre or for university presentations and displays.  Role  The role of NCS career advisers is to increase awareness of the Naval Service to potential recruits and the general public and to enable the service to meet recruitment targets. Career advisers interview potential applicants, administer selection tests, check recruits meet eligibility requirements and assist them in completing necessary documentation. They may also accompany potential recruits on visits to Royal Navy establishments, attend careers fairs and carry out presentations to schools and colleges and outreach events.

The creosote, which contains carcinogenic polyaromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) compounds, seeped into sediments, soil and groundwater. A storm drain built in the 1970s along the east side of the former lagoon transported liquid contaminants to the pond. The site was added to the National Priorities List on September 8, 1983. A 1985 Record of Decision specified remedies for cleaning up the site. A landfill for the contaminants was constructed at the former lagoon. The storm drain was relocated.

Polyploidy common.  Taxonomy  Tulipeae remained a core group of the Liliaceae, containing the type genus, Lilium for most of its taxonomic history. For instance, Bentham and Hooker (1883), placed Lilium together with Tulipa and five other genera in Liliaceae tribe Tulipeae. In the modern era, TakhtadzhiÔ∏†an described the tribe as having four genera: * Tulipa * Amana (considered by some to be included in Tulipa) * Holongia * Erythronium Later only Tulipa and Erythronium were included, and Gagea was added. Tulipeae has been variously constructed, chiefly as either a tribe of the subfamily Lilioideae, or a subfamily of Liliaceae itself (Tulipoideae). However it has been proposed that Gagea should be in its own tribe, the Lloydieae. The evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships of Tulipeae within Liliaceae are shown in the following Cladogram. Here, Tulipeae is shown as a clade within the broader construction of Lileae (sensu lato), or as a separate biogeographical tribe if the narrow sense of Lileae (sensu stricto) is adopted, with Lileae and Tulipeae as sister groups. The continuing use of Tulipeae as a separate tribe is supported by several authors. = Genera = Genera (species) * Amana Honda (5) * Erythronium L. (15) * Gagea Salisb. (=Lloydia Salisb.)

The area developed from the mid to late 19th century particularly with the expansion of the shoe manufacturing and engineering industries, and also the extension of the railway from London in June 1882. History=Northampton Abbey= The area is named after St James' Abbey which was founded in the town 1104‚Äì05 by William Peverel as an Augustinian monastery dedicated to St James and which was built in the area of the modern development. The abbey was located in the Abbots Way area, off the south side of Weedon Road in the town (see map). The former Express Lift factory, which included the lift-testing tower, was redeveloped for housing in 1999‚Äì2000. The site was known to occupy part of the precinct of the abbey. Excavations were carried out to determine the location and remains of any parts of the abbey. The abbey and a cemetery were located. The main buildings were preserved beneath the new housing development. The cemetery of c.300 burials was excavated during winter 2000‚Äì2001. The bones were analysed to determine the health and burial practices in the late medieval population of Northampton. 294 burials were uncovered in well ordered rows, with many wooden coffins, graves lined with old ceramic roof-tiles, stone-lined graves and a single stone coffin suggesting the occupants of relatively high status. Use of the cemetery later was less orderly. Burials were in simple, shallow graves with just a shroud. On the south side was a stone-built building with two mortuary chapels. One had a stone-lined tomb, and a fragment of life-sized sculptured leg, with chain mail and a stirrup strap from a broken effigy. This may have happened at the dissolution of the abbey in 1538. A highly decorated grave slab and the remains of two skeletons had been unearthed in 1970. Analysis of the burials shows a large number of elderly people many having suffered from trauma such as leg fractures, fused and/or deformed leg joints and advanced spine degeneration. Many of these may have died in the abbey infirmary and further analysis is being undertaken. =First World War= On 19 October 1917 at 10.45 pm German Zeppelins dropped bombs near Burghley Park then passed over Northampton dropping nine incendiary bombs over Kingsthorpe, Dallington and Far Cotton. Another fell on the roof of 46 Parkwood Street on St. James probably aiming for the Station. The house was occupied by Mr. Henry Gammons, a railway bricklayer, who was away at the time. His wife, Mrs. Eliza Gammons, and twin daughters Gladys and Lily, aged 13, were in bed. The bomb passed through the house to the bedroom, killing the mother instantly and set fire to the room. Both mother and daughters were killed.Full story: Far Cotton Historical Society, accessed 2014_01_21 Governance The St James neighbourhood grew up in the parts of the parishes of Dallington and Duston adjacent to the city. In 1895 two new parishes, Dallington St James and Dunston St James, were carved out to cover the built-up areas of the parishes, and together they were administered by the new St James Northampton urban district. This district only survived until 1900, since when St James' End has been administered as part of the town. The parishes survived until 1913.http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/unit/10273067/relationships St James' End is now in the St James Ward of Northampton Borough Council, currently held by the Labour Party. St James End has been part of the Sixfields division of Northamptonshire County Council since the 2013 county council elections, when it was held by the Liberal Democrat party. The division covers the Northampton town areas of Briar Hill, Camp Hill, part of West Hunsbury, Hunsbury Hill, Swan Valley, Hunsbury Meadows, Upton and St James. The population of this ward at the 2011 Census was 5,465. Notable buildings St James today is most notable for the presence of the National Lift Tower in Weedon Road, formerly the Express Lift Tower and nicknamed the 'Northampton Lighthouse'. The building is a lift-testing tower built by the Express Lift Company which closed in 1990. The building was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 12 November 1982. The Parish Church of St James in St James' Road was built in 1868‚Äì71 by R. Wheeler of Tonbridge, Kent, with additional work in 1900 and the tower in 1920. The brick is exposed inside and enriched with black bricks. The Doddridge Centre in St James Road was built in 1895 as the Doddridge Memorial Chapel in memory of Philip Doddridge (1702‚Äì1751), an English Nonconformist. It provides facilities and support to community and voluntary groups with 30 groups based in the building and another 40 using it as a meeting point for a variety of activities. The chapel where Doddridge served from 1729‚Äì51 is in Doddridge Street on the east side of the river. It dates from 1695 and is now a United Reformed Church. The interior has galleries, box pews and a memorial to Doddridge. St James is home to the Northampton Saints Rugby Football Club at Franklin's Gardens stadium on the south-west side of lower Weedon Road. The club was established in 1880 under the original title of Northampton St James by Rev Samuel Wathen Wigg, a clergyman and curate of St James' Church. The Sixfields Stadium used by Northampton Town Football Club (known as \\"The Cobblers\\") at the top end of Weedon road in the area known as Sixfields currently playing in League Division Two. The Sixfields area also has a large Sainsbury's supermarket, Boots, M&S; Simply Food, Wickes, McDonald's, several restaurants, a multi-screen cinema, and several other retail outlets. The First Northampton bus service operated out of the former Northampton Transport depot on St James's Road but withdrew services on 14 September 2013. The depot remained in operation until 22 October 2013 to service the First Northampton operated Luton Airport Parkway railway station ‚Äì Luton Airport service. It was then transferred to First Essex's Chelmsford depot.Office of the Traffic Commissioner Notices and Proceedings September 2013 Office of the Traffic Commissioner 4 September 2013 Accessed 2014_01_17 This left the large depot empty. It had been opened in 1904 as the main depot for electric trams and then in the 1920s for motorbuses. Between then and 1939 it was extended considerably, but in 2013 the last service bus left and the depot was made redundant.St James Tram Car Sheds and Omnibus Depot ‚Äì Out of Service?

( The depot site remains enclosed by Church's branded hoarding but untouched since 2014 ). The front entrance to the building has images of a Native American (see gallery). This reflects the previous ownership by the company Padmore and Barnes; they produced footwear using a moccasin construction, and a Native American was their emblem; they produced some 6,000 pairs of moccasins in the first half of the 20th century. A statue stood at the top of the front of the building but was removed when the works closed.Graces Guide 1947, Accessed 2014_01_22 The large and thriving St James Industrial Estate along St James Mill Road near West Bridge is host to a large number of business and industrial establishments including the headquarters of Cosworth Engineering. There are three public houses in St James: The Thomas √Å Becket and the Foundrymans Arms in St James Road and The Sevens in Weedon Road. There is also a working men's club in Weedon Road. A fourth pub, The Castle, in St James Park Road, was converted to rented flats and a shop ( now empty ) - marking the end of the building's use as a public house. Traffic issues Both St James Road and Spencer Bridge Road feed into Weedon Road and are the main exits to the M1 motorway at junction 16. All these roads are busy 24/7 with heavy traffic, fumes and noise from vehicles. A recent report for Northampton Borough Council states: \\"Existing conditions within the study area show poor air quality, with concentrations of nitrogen dioxide exceeding the annual mean objective along Weedon Road and St James‚Äô Road near to the development site. An AQMA (Air quality management area) has been declared for this area\\" . Air Quality Consultants report on Franklin Gardens expansion, October 2013, Accessed 1014_01_17 1998 floods The part of St James in St James Road and the lower parts of Harlestone Road and Weedon Road are low lying and in the flood plain of the River Nene and its tributaries. In April 1998, many residents of both St James had to leave their homes and seek temporary accommodation elsewhere, after part of the area, along with Far Cotton and Cotton End, suffered flooding, when the River Nene broke its banks after torrential rain. Flooding occurred on Good Friday, 10 April 1998. Since then river banks have been raised and flood mitigation lakes created west of the town (see gallery). Area maps and views=2014 map= There is no exact de-lineation of the St James area ‚Äì the red outline on the modern map shown below gives the area generally regarded as St James. This differs from official designations of Borough Council Wards and County Council Divisions which often include additional areas used to even up the numbers of voters. The northern area comprises what are known as the 'Scottish streets' after their street names. On the west side, off Weedon Road, is the Lift Tower estate and several side roads up the hill to Sixfields. In the south is the large and thriving St James Industrial Estate along St James Mill Road. Part of the St James area extends east of the railway into St James retail park with a large B&Q; store, Toys R Us, Curry's, PC World, Dunelm, Next and several other outlets plus Kentucky Fried Chicken and Starbucks restaurants. The eastern part of St James lies just west of a tributary of the River Nene and the railway station and was the first part of the area to be developed for housing and industrial use in the mid and late 19th century as can be seen from the 1899 map. This area extends to Spencer Bridge Road in the north beyond which is the area of the town known as Spencer, after the Spencer family of Althorp, about 5 miles north, however the area includes the houses nearest to Harlestone Road including St James Church of England Primary School. This is the only school in the St James area and has nearly 500 pupils aged 3 to 11.County Council website for St James School, accessed 2014_01_17Department for Education performance data for St James School, Northampton, Accessed 2014_01_17 The school was rated 'good' at the last OFSTED inspection.St James School Northampton, OFSTED Inspection 2011, Accessed 2014_01_17 Part of the area south-west of St James Road appear on the 1899 map such as Abbey Street, Almad Street, Lincoln Road and Spencer Street. Other areas further up Weedon Road have terraced houses on the 1899 map but have been cleared for three blocks of council flats close to Franklin's Gardens stadium. =1899 map= The eastern part of St James was the first area to be developed for housing and industrial use in the mid and late 19th century as this map shows. There are three shoe factories shown, a tannery, saw mills and a cycle works. The railway arrived from London, Euston in 1881 on a loop line from the main line north of the village of Roade, although a connection to Market Harborough and further north was in place earlier. The large good area at the station reflects the main method of goods transit at the time. What is now Victoria Park is shown on the map as a recreation ground. The park was opened in 1898 on land donated by Earl Spencer of Althorpe. At that time it was half the present size. Further land was acquired from the Earl in 1910 and 1911 and it now has a bowling green, tennis courts and children's play area. =Gallery= File:St James, Northampton, England street map.jpg2014 map of St James End: the red area is the usual limit of the area - see text File:St James Old Ordnance Survey Map 1899.jpgExtract from Ordnance survey map dated 1899 showing part of the St James are west of Northampton Railway Station File:Dodridge_Centre,_St_James_End,_Northampton.jpgThe Doddridge Centre in St James Road, about a 10-minute walk from Northampton railway station File:St_James_Northampton_England_traffic_junction.jpgThe busy junction of St James Road, Harlestone Road and Weedon Road off-peak File:Church's_Works_in_St_James_Northampton.jpgChurch's shoe factory in St James Road File:Indian_image_Church's_Shoe_Factory_St_James.jpgIndian image on Church's Shoe Factory main entrance - see text File:Former bus depot St James Road Northampton.jpgFormer tram and bus depot, St James Road, derelict from 2013 File:Northampton_Corporation_transport_offices.jpgLong abandoned stylish Northampton Corporation Transport Offices in St James Road File:Flood_defences_in_St_James.jpgFlood defences: looking south on the east side of St James opposite Northampton Station.

There, he developed local industry and served two terms as mayor. Fargo was elected to the Illinois House of Representatives in 1912. Biography Henry Bond Fargo, a fourth cousin once removed of J. C. and William Fargo, was born in 1843 in Warsaw, New York. The son of blacksmith William N. Fargo, Henry Fargo moved with his family to Delavan, Wisconsin when he was a child. By 1860, the family had removed to Fond du Lac. Fargo began his first business enterprises in his new home, becoming involved with real estate. He opened a real estate agency in Redwood Falls, Minnesota. His success in his endeavors brought him to the attention of E. A. Cummings & Co., the largest real estate business in Chicago, Illinois, who hired Fargo as their principal salesman.http://gis.hpa.state.il.us/pdfs/164668.pdf Henry moved to Geneva, Illinois in 1887 into the former home of Isaac Wilson. Fargo became a prominent politician and businessman in Geneva. Fargo founded the First National Bank of Geneva and was its first president.

It was the first alternative entrance into the main system to be explored, and it is now a popular entrance into the system, with a fine pitch landing in Gaping Gill's South-East Passage. It lies within the designated Ingleborough Site of Special Scientific Interest. Description A climb down in the small shakehole soon leads to a tight pitch. At the bottom the passage passes beneath the aven where Wade's Entrance joins, and after a further it goes round a series of bends to where the last pitch of OBJ Hole enters. There is a chamber after a further where a small stream enters from an inlet passage. Downstream a succession of climbs and a pitch reach the main pitch of . South- East Passage in Gaping Gill may be stepped into at the level, but the shaft continues in two stages as South-East Pot to a deep pool. This is a window into a large underwater passage, and dye tests have shown that the water from Gaping Gill Main Chamber and from Stream Passage Pot flow through this passage. Above the final shaft there is a tight passage, Horrocks-Stearn Crawl, which connects to Bar Pot above its main pitch. Wade's Entrance () is an alternative entrance north-east of Flood Entrance Pot. A climb down lands at the top of a pitch which drops into the passage a few metres downstream of the Flood Entrance Pot entrance pitch. This is a very much easier than the original entrance, and is the voie normale. OBJ Pot (), is a third entrance north-east of Flood Entrance Pot immediately to the east of the path. It consists of a free-climbable pitch, followed by a and an pitch which is choked with shingle. The way on is actually at the base of the second pitch where a tight rift leads into an equally tight inlet that enters the roof of the main passage in Flood Entrance Pot. History South-East Pot was discovered and free-climbed down to a depth of in 1906 by the Yorkshire Ramblers' Club during a Winch Meet. They commented on the high aven above it, which later proved to be the last Pitch of Flood Entrance Pot. The shaft was bottomed in May of the following year. Flood Entrance Pot was first entered in 1909 by the Yorkshire Speleological Association who were motivated to look for an entrance after finding some flies and a red worm at the bottom of South-East Pot. They concluded that these must have come from the surface having descended the high aven above. It gained its name as it allowed the Gaping Gill system to be entered even when the Main Shaft was in flood. Wade's Entrance was opened up by the Bradford Pothole Club in 1957. Eric Wade failing to get through the entrance squeeze in Flood Entrance, dug in an adjacent shakehole and got through after getting a voice connection. OBJ Pot was opened up by the British Speleological Association in August 1949. It took its name from a beer brewed by Dutton's brewery in Blackburn (the initials stand for Oh be joyful). The connection was finally made with Flood Entrance Pot by Bradford Pothole Club in May 2010, who enlarged the rift at the bottom of the second pitch. In 1980 Lancaster University Speleological Society published a comprehensive survey and description of the cave.

As her son Ma Xisheng (Ma Yin's second son) was born in 899,New History of the Five Dynasties, vol. 66.Ma Xisheng's biographies in the New History of the Five Dynasties and the Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms never actually gave his birth year, even indirectly. However, his brother and successor Ma Xifan's biography indicated Ma Xifan was 48 at his death in 947, and further indicated that Ma Xifan was born on the same day as Ma Xisheng, thus indicating what Ma Xisheng's birth year was, as well. she must have become Ma Yin's concubine prior to that point.

At some point of his reign as the Prince, then King, of Chu, Lady Yuan received the regal consort title of Defei; she was the only one who, in historical accounts, was stated to have received a regal consort title. Under traditional principles of succession, Ma Yin's first son Ma Xizhen (È¶¨Â∏åÊåØ), who was born of his wife (whose name was not given in historical accounts), should have been his heir. However, because of the favor that Ma Yin had for Consort Yuan, he designated Ma Xisheng his heir, and Ma Xisheng made no efforts to even put up an appearance of willing to yield to other brothers. (Ma Xizhen, apparently to avoid a confrontation with Ma Xisheng, became a Taoist monk and departed from the court scene.) Ma Xisheng's failure to show any willingness to yield caused great resentment in both Lady Chen and Ma Xifan, and Lady Chen, from that point on, had a chilly relationship with Consort Yuan.Spring and Autumn Annals of the Ten Kingdoms, vol. 68.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 278.  After Ma Yin's death  Ma Yin died in 930, and Ma Xisheng succeeded him as the ruler of the state.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 277. Ma Xisheng, in turn, died in 932, and was succeeded by Ma Xifan. Still bearing resentment toward Ma Xisheng and Consort Yuan, it was said that Ma Xifan was not properly honoring Consort Yuan. At this time, Consort Yuan's younger son Ma Xiwang was serving as the commander of the headquarters guards. Ma Xifan found excuses to rebuke him frequently. Worried for Ma Xiwang's safety, Consort Yuan requested that Ma Xiwang be stripped of his titles and be allowed to become a Taoist monk. Ma Xifan refused, but stripped him of his military command, made him live in a bamboo house with a door made of straw, and forbid him from attending meetings of their brothers. After Consort Yuan died ‚Äî which historical sources did not give a date for, but which the Zizhi Tongjian implied was in or shortly after 933 ‚Äî Ma Xiwang, in fear and anger, also died.

History of the business The M. Tholom√© company was located at Rue Godillot 27 in Saint-Ouen, Seine- Saint-Denis. In the years directly following the First World War there were many people keen to buy cars but unable to afford them. Cyclecars which were in effect just like normal cars but smaller, lighter and cheaper were a response to this demand, and cyclecar manufacturers proliferated in several European countries, especially France. Tholom√© was among the more prominent French cycle car makers. A Tholom√© advertisement from 1920 highlights one particular attraction: the car‚Äôs weight of 320 kg (i.e. less than 350 kg) meant that it qualified for a reduced annual car tax charge of just 100 francs. The cars At the Motor Show in October 1919 the manufacture took a stand and presented an open topped two seater cyclecar that could be ordered with either a V2 7HP 750cc motor-bike engine or a 4-cylinder 10HP 900cc unit, subsequently also available with 1095cc. The four cylinder engines came from Ruby, another cyclecar manufacturer, located nearby: the smaller engines were supplied by the Train motorbike company. Customers specifying the larger engine were then given a choice between a 2-speed or a 5-speed manual transmission. An advertisement for the cars in 1920 described the cars, which came with open-topped ‚Äútorpedo‚Äù style bodies with fashionably tapered ‚Äúboat- deck‚Äù style rears, and featuring two seats, positioned one beside the other. Prices were given for ‚Äúcomplete cars‚Äù, including a hood, a windscreen, lighting, a kit of tools and a spare wheel. The 750cc engine version was priced at 5,350 francs while the four cylinder engine cars were listed at 6,660 francs or 7,250 francs according to whether a two speed or five speed transmission was specified.

Colorado's 7th Senate District encompasses Mesa County and a portion of Garfield County. *2012 Redistricted to District 55, and with incumbent Republican Representative Laura Bradford leaving the Legislature, Scott ran unopposed for the June 26, 2012 Republican Primary, winning with 6,330 votes, and won the three-way November 6, 2012 General election with 22,056 votes (58.2%) against Democratic nominee Dan Robinson and Libertarian candidate Virgil Fenn. *2010 When District 54 Republican Representative Steve King ran for Colorado Senate, Scott won the August 10, 2010 Republican Primary with 6,352 votes (55.5%), and was unopposed for the November 2, 2010 General election, winning with 26,176 votes. \\"Fake News\\" Incident After the Grand Junction Daily Sentinel published a column urging him to advance a bill granting journalists greater access to public records, Scott referred to the article and the newspaper as \\"fake news\\" on social media. The newspaper's publisher reacted by threatening to sue.  Ray Scott Social Media Blocking Case  On May 13, 2019, the American Civil Liberties Union of Colorado filed a lawsuit in Federal District Court against Colorado State Senator Ray Scott on behalf of his constituent Anne Landman for blocking her from his official Facebook and Twitter pages. Landman had been able to interact with Scott and others in these spaces until June 2017, until after she wrote an article critical of Senator Scott‚Äôs position on climate change and posted it on his official Facebook page. In response, Scott blocked Landman from his official Facebook page and Twitter account. Scott refused many requests from Landman to ‚Äúunblock‚Äù and ‚Äúunban‚Äù her, and even ignored an ethics complaint that Landman and two other blocked constituents had filed with the Colorado State Senate in August 2017. Landman alleged in her ACLU complaintComplaint, U.S. Dist. Ct., Colorado, Anne Landman, Plaintiff v. Ray Scott, Colorado State Senator for District 7, Defendant - Civil Action 1:19-cv-1367, filed May 13, 2019 (Verified complaint - full text) https://acluco-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp- content/uploads/2019/05/Dkt.-1-Complaint.pdf that Scott had violated her First Amendment rights by blocking and banning her from the interactive portions of his official government Facebook page and Twitter account. The complaint cited ten previous legal cases that had been resolved in her favor by that point. Scott settled the social media blocking case on September 10, 2019 for $25,000, using taxpayer funds to pay Ms. Landman's legal fees. The legal fees Senator Scott's government-funded attorneys charged were not disclosed. The settlement required Scott agree \\"to refrain from 'blocking' or 'banning' any individuals or organizations, including Ms. Landman and organizations with which she is affiliated,\\" and \\"refrain from deleting or hiding any comments posted\\" on his official Facebook page and Twitter account. The agreement applied \\"to any official Facebook page and official Twitter account Senator Scott might establish in the future as a government official, even if he is, at that time, holding a different position within the government, whether state, federal, or local, regardless of whether that position is obtained by election, appointment, or employment.\\" The Grand Junction, Colorado Daily Sentinel published an editorial about the case on September 11, 2019 titled \\"The Price of Obstinance\\" which stated, \\"It's hard to believe that it took state Sen. Ray Scott this long to appreciate ‚Äî or even understand ‚Äî how he was trampling on the First Amendment, especially given the number of editorials we've written condemning his practice of blocking critics on social media accounts in which he self-identifies as an elected government official...The right thing to do would have been to take corrective action immediately, unblock constituents and apologize for violating the Constitution. Instead, Scott waited to get sued, leaving taxpayers on the hook for the ACLU's attorneys fees ‚Äî again, despite our warning that he was playing with fire...\\" ReferencesExternal links *Official page at the Colorado General Assembly *Campaign site * Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Colorado Republicans Category:Colorado state senators Category:People from Garfield County, Colorado Category:People from Grand Junction, Colorado Category:Members of the Colorado House of Representatives Category:21st-century American politicians ","title":"Ray Scott (Colorado politician)"},{"id":"41595722","text":"Aliabad (, also Romanized as ‚ÄòAlƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd and Alƒ´ƒÅbƒÅd) is a village in Garkan-e Shomali Rural District, Pir Bakran District, Falavarjan County, Isfahan Province, Iran.

Heilman (born ) is a Canadian emergency physician, Wikipedian, and advocate for the improvement of Wikipedia's health-related content. He encourages other clinicians to contribute to the online encyclopedia. With the Wikipedia username Doc James, Heilman is an active contributor to WikiProject Medicine and a volunteer Wikipedia administrator. He was the president of Wikimedia Canada between 2010 and 2013, and founded and was formerly the president of Wiki Project Med Foundation. He is also the founder of WikiProject Medicine's Medicine Translation Task Force. In June 2015, he was elected to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees, a position which he held until he was removed on December 28, 2015. Heilman was re-elected to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees in May 2017. Heilman is a clinical assistant professor at the department of emergency medicine at the University of British Columbia, and the head of the department of emergency medicine at East Kootenay Regional Hospital in Cranbrook, British Columbia, where he lives. Early life and education Born in , Heilman was born and raised in rural Saskatchewan. He graduated from the University of Saskatchewan in 2000 with a Bachelor of Science degree in anatomy, and he subsequently earned his medical degree there in 2003. He then completed his family medicine residency in British Columbia from 2003 to 2005. Heilman currently holds a certificate of added competency in the field of emergency medicine with the College of Family Physicians of Canada.https://emergency.med.ubc.ca/person/james-heilman/ Medical career Heilman worked at Moose Jaw Union Hospital, a hospital in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, until 2010, when he began working at East Kootenay Regional Hospital, where, in October 2012, he was appointed head of the department of emergency medicine. In 2014, he told the Cranbrook Daily Townsman that the emergency department at East Kootenay saw an average of 22,000 patients each year. Research As of May 2014, Heilman was working on a study with Samir Grover, of the University of Toronto, which would assign medical students to take a test using either Wikipedia or medical textbooks to determine which is more accurate. Later that year, Heilman co-authored a version of the Wikipedia article for dengue fever in the peer-reviewed journal Open Medicine. Heilman also worked on a study with Microsoft which found that in the three countries where the 2013‚Äì2016 Ebola outbreak had the largest impact, Wikipedia was the most popular source for information about the disease. In 2015, Heilman and Andrew West published a study which found that the number of Wikipedia editors who focused on editing medical articles decreased by 40 per cent from 2008 to 2013. These results, together with other detailed analyses about the production and consumption of medical content on Wikipedia, were published by the Journal of Medical Internet Research in 2015. Wikipedia and Wikimedia activities Question and answer session with Heilman about editing Wikipedia at the University of British Columbia Since the beginning of his activity as a contributor to medicine-related Wikipedia articles in 2008, Heilman has been promoting the improvement of medical content by encouraging fellow physicians to take part. He became interested in editing Wikipedia on a slow night shift, when he looked up the article on obesity and found that it contained many errors. \\"I realized that I could fix it. I made a huge number of edits and improved the quality a great deal. I sort of became hooked from there,\\" he told the Hamilton Spectator in 2011. As of 2016, he edited medical articles on Wikipedia for about 60 hours a week. Heilman takes part in an initiative through Wiki Project Med Foundation with Translators Without Borders, working to improve and translate English Wikipedia medical articles of top importance into minority languages. The Wiki Project Med Foundation has started a collaboration with the University of California, San Francisco as a recruit for scientifically literate editors, by giving students college credit for improving medicine-related Wikipedia pages. In 2014, the Wiki Project Med Foundation also partnered with the Cochrane Collaboration, with the goal of improving the reliability and accuracy of information on Wikipedia. With regard to this partnership, Heilman said, \\"The way Wikipedia works is that all content is to stand entirely on the references that are listed. If the best quality sources are used to write Wikipedia there's a good chance that Wikipedia will contain the best quality information.\\" Heilman spoke at Wikimania 2014, where he said that 93 per cent of medical students use Wikipedia, and argued that \\"fixing the internet\\" is now a critical task for anyone who cares about healthcare. =Ebola contributions= By reviewing and correcting medical content in the manner promoted by Heilman (and with many of his contributions), in Wikipedia articles like that about Ebola, Wikipedia has become a source of information to the general public, thus being regarded among respected sites run by the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, covering the topic. Heilman reduced the time he spent working in the emergency department so he could spend more time updating this page. In 2014, he told the Cranbrook Daily Townsman that with respect to Wikipedia's coverage of Ebola, \\"The big thing is emphasizing what we know, making sure that minor concerns don‚Äôt get blown out of proportion.\\" He also said that, despite rumours to the contrary, there was no evidence that the disease had become airborne, and that ebola had caused far fewer deaths than other conditions such as malaria and gastroenteritis. =Rorschach test images= In 2009, Heilman, who was then a resident of Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, added public domain images of the ink blots used in the Rorschach test to the Wikipedia article on the subject, and concerned psychologists said that this could invalidate the tests. Some psychologists stated the test had \\"already lost its popularity and usefulness.\\" In an interview with The New York Times, Heilman stated that he added the entire set because a debate about a single image seemed absurd and psychologists' fears were unfounded. Appearing on Canada AM on July 31, 2009, Heilman also said that \\"This information [i.e. the inkblots] is encyclopedic. This is what people expect to see when they see this page.\\" In August 2009, two Canadian psychologists filed complaints about Heilman to his local doctors' organization; Heilman called the complaints \\"intimidation tactics\\". In September 2009, the College of Psychologists of British Columbia urged the Saskatchewan College of Physicians and Surgeons to launch an investigation into Heilman's posting of the images. Heilman told CTV News that \\"The psychological community is trying to exclude everybody outside their field from taking part in discussions related to what they do. And personally, I think that's bad science.\\" An extensive debate ensued on Wikipedia, and the images were kept. =Textbook plagiarism of Wikipedia= In 2012, Heilman noticed that the book Understanding and Management of Special Child in Pediatric Dentistry, published by Jaypee Brothers, contained a long passage about HIV that was plagiarized from Wikipedia's article on the subject. This subsequently led to the book being withdrawn by the publisher. In October 2014, while reading a copy of the Oxford Textbook of Zoonoses (published by Oxford University Press), Heilman noticed that the book's section on Ebola was very similar to the Wikipedia page on that subject. He initially suspected that a Wikipedia editor had copied the portion but later noticed that the part of the Wikipedia article that resembled the part of the textbook had been written in 2006 and 2010, while the textbook had not been published until 2011. Christian Purdy, an Oxford University Press spokesperson, acknowledged that some of the text in the textbook had been copied but described it as an \\"inadvertent omission of an appropriate attribution\\" rather than plagiarism. =Tenure on the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees= In June 2015, Heilman was elected by the community to the Wikimedia Foundation Board of Trustees. In December 2015, the board removed Heilman from his position as a Trustee, a decision that generated substantial controversy amongst members of the Wikipedia community. A statement released by the board declared the lack of confidence of his fellow trustees in him as the reasons for his ousting. Heilman later stated that he \\"was given the option of resigning [by the board] over the last few weeks. As a community elected member I see my mandate as coming from the community which elected me and thus declined to do so. I saw such a move as letting down those who elected me.\\" He subsequently pointed out that while on the board, he had pushed for greater transparency regarding the Wikimedia Foundation's controversial Knowledge Engine project and its financing, and indicated that his attempts to make public the Knight Foundation grant for the engine had been a factor in his dismissal. The volunteer community re-elected him to the Wikimedia Foundation board in 2017. =Other= In 2012, Heilman was one of two Wikimedia contributors sued by Internet Brands for shifting freely licensed content and volunteer editors from the for-profit site Wikitravel to the non-profit site Wikivoyage. The Wikimedia Foundation defended Heilman's actions in the lawsuit, citing volunteer freedom of choice. In February 2013, the parties settled their litigation. In 2014, Heilman criticized a study which concluded that 9 out of 10 Wikipedia medical articles contained errors. In 2015, the Atlantic ran a piece about conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia which detailed Heilman's efforts to counteract edits made by employees of Medtronic to the Wikipedia page for percutaneous vertebroplasty. In 2017, Vice also ran an article about conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia, in which the author noted that Heilman had vocally called on the Wikimedia Foundation to increase its enforcement of Wikipedia's policy against undisclosed paid editing. Personal life Heilman enjoys running ultramarathons and adventure racing. He and his girlfriend ran the Gobi March in 2008. He has also run the Marathon des Sables, the Adventure Racing World Championships, and the Saskatchewan Marathon.

It is the only currently recognized plant species in the genus Medeola. It grows in the understory of forests. The plant bears edible rhizomes that have a mild cucumber-like flavor. Description Medeola virginiana shoots consist of two tiers of whorled leaves. The lower tier typically bears between five and nine (occasionally up to 12) lance shaped leaves. The upper tier bears three to five ovate leaves. The leaves have an entire (smooth) margin. Some individuals lack a second tier of whorled leaves. The second tier is produced when the plant flowers. When two-tiered, plants grow to high. The flowers have yellowish green tepals and appear in late spring. The fruit is a dark blue to purple, inedible berry above the top tier of leaves.Linnaeus, Carl von. 1753. Species Plantarum 1: 339.Gleason, H. A. & A.J. Cronquist. 1991. Manual of the Vascular Plants of Northeastern United States and Adjacent Canada (ed. 2) i‚Äì910. New York Botanical Garden, Bronx. Indian cucumber-root shoots arise each spring from an overwintering tuberlike structure. This structure produces a series of horizontal rhizomes at 45 degree angles which produces a clonal colony of plants in an octagonal pattern. Taxonomy and systematics The genus Medeola was formerly associated with the lilioid genera Trillium and Paris, which are now placed in the tribe Paridae of the family Melanthiaceae in the order Liliales. Armen Takhtajan separated Medeola from Trillium and Paris, and placed it in its own family, Medeolaceae, which he erected in 1987, based on a description that had been published in 1879 by Sereno Watson. The genera Medeola and Clintonia now constitute the tribe Medeoleae of the subfamily Lilioideae in the family Liliaceae, as narrowly defined in the APG IV system. Molecular, morphological, embryological, and cytological evidence supports a sister relationship between Medeola and Clintonia. The Flora of North America includes both of these in the family Liliaceae. Some species of Asparagus were formerly placed in the genus Medeola, including: * Medeola angustifolia now Asparagus asparagoides * Medeola asparagoides now Asparagus asparagoides * Medeola latifolia now Asparagus asparagoides * Medeola triphylla now Asparagus declinatus Distribution and habitat Medeola virginiana is found from Ontario to Nova Scotia, south to Florida, and Louisiana.

Genesis Van Gogh described his intention in a letter written August 13, 1888: Painted a few hundred metres behind his Yellow House, where the railway yard abuts the Rh√¥ne river, he had written his brother Theo two weeks earlier: A series was created, as argued by the Van Gogh Museum's curators Leo Jansen, Hans Luijten and Nienke Bakker, because van Gogh \\"split the subject he describes here into two, perhaps because he realised that a high vantage point and a sunset are very hard to reconcile in a single composition.\\" They conclude, \\"We do not know exactly when the latter two studies were made; there may be a connection with a letter 697, in which Van Gogh says he has painted a sunset.\\" A leading 20th century van Gogh scholar, Jan Hulsker explained: This argument has been expanded to: ReferencesBibliography * de la Faille, Jacob-Baart.

On the southern portal there is an inscription as follows: :::Pray for Khaje Petros, who was a good man, in the presence of God. He built this church by his own personal expenditure for the immortality of his name and his father's name (Vali Jan) and his mother's name (Shoushan) and his family's name in 1077 (in the Armenian calendar which is 1627 in the Gregorian calendar).

He is a record-holding 20-time winner of The Moth's StorySlam. He also acted alongside Shonali Bhowmik in the 2013 short comedy Sardines Out Of A Can. A story of his was featured on the Moth podcast in January 2009. He has made appearances on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn and Late Night with Conan O'Brien. He published his Audible Original audiobook titled You Ought to Know Adam Wade in 2020. Biography After graduating from Keene State College, Wade moved to New York City to take a course at New York University that came with an internship at Twentieth Century Fox. In his spare time, he became a public speaker, speaking to people about his stories in small facilities. A year or two afterward, Wade became an NBC page, which afforded him the opportunity to have regular appearances on ESPN. It was during this time he began doing standup, usually working with a guitar on stage. He then worked as a production assistant on Tough Crowd with Colin Quinn. During this time, Wade made the transition to omitting the guitar from his performances and telling stories instead (a suggestion of Quinn's). He was soon performing storytelling in The Moth and at many other places, and described himself on stage to be a slightly amplified version of who he is. Adam performs regularly at the Theatre Under St. Marks, the Upright Citizens Brigade Theater, and the Magnet Theater in New York City. On April 5, 2012, he was featured in The New York Times piece \\"Telling Tales With a Tear and a Smile\\". He has appeared in numerous TV, radio, and film appearances including Comedy Central's Inside Amy Schumer, The NFL Network's Top 10 Football Follies, ESPN's Classic Now and WFMU's 7 Second Delay. He has contributed to Vulture.com and NY Press. In addition to these credits, he also started teaching courses in storytelling in New York, running private workshops on his own and longer running classes at the Magnet Theater. In September 2015, Wade released his first comedy album, Human Comedy. On May 1, 2018, Wade released his second comedy album, Live at the Magnet Theater.

He also served as the Organisation of African Unity's Assistant Secretary General, the Arab League's Assistant Secretary-general, the Secretary-General of the United Nations's Special Representative for Somalia in 1992 and the Secretary-General of the United Nations's Special Representative for the Great Lakes region of Africa in 1997Press release of the United Nations on 27 January 1997: Mohamed Sahnoun of Algeria nominated UN/OAU special representative for great lakes region of Africa before continuing to work for peace and reconciliation through various UN-relatedUPEACE ‚Äì University for Peace or independent charities.International Institute for Sustainable Development Initiatives of Change, interview with Katherine Marshall He particularly focused on developing intercultural and inter-religious dialogues and on healing wounded memories from past conflicts. Early years and Algerian War Mohamed Sahnoun was born in 1931 in Chlef (known as Castellum Tingitanum during Roman times, Al Asnam during the Umayyad Caliphate period and from 1962 to 1980 as well as Orl√©ansville during the French colonization), in Algeria. He first studied at the Lyc√©e of Algiers and then went on at the Sorbonne in Paris. He was there on the day of the first hostilities of the Algerian War (1 November 1954). As an activist of the FLN, he responded to the call to strike launched by the '‚ÄôUnion g√©n√©rale des √©tudiants musulmans alg√©riens (Ugema)'‚Äô on 19 May 1956,Henry Clement-Moore, L'Ugema (1955‚Äì1962) : t√©moignages, Casbah √âditions, Alger, 2011 stopped studying in Paris and came back home in Algeria. There, he started to work in the 'Social Centers' created by former French Resistance fighter Germaine Tillon with the agreement of Jacques Soustelle (then Governor General of Algeria) in order to alleviate misery, squalor and illiteracy in Algerian populations.Sybille Chapeu, Des Chr√©tiens dans la Guerre d'Alg√©rie: l'action de la mission de France, √âditions ¬´ Atelier Ed De L'¬ª, Paris, 2004 In March 1957, the organisation was raided and searched by police, who arrested and detained twelve Christians (among which priests) and twenty-three Muslims. Being one of the managers of the 'Social Centers', Mohamed Sahnoun was part of this group, which was charged with conspiracy and tried in a fairly loudly-trumpeted trial, nicknamed the ‚ÄúProgressive Christians‚Äù trial. Mohamed Sahnoun was subsequently detained in the infamous \\"\\", the torture and detention centre of the 1st Foreign Parachute Regiment during the Battle of Algiers. He himself was subjected to torture.Les ennemis compl√©mentaires: guerre d'Alg√©rie, par Germaine Tillon, √âditions Tir√©sias, 2005, Released for lack of conclusive evidence, Mohamed Sahnoun then sought refuge in metropolitan France, in Clichy then in Switzerland in Lausanne. He was unable to go back to Algeria before independence. During his early years Mohamed Sahnoun also got acquainted with the pacifist NGO Service Civil International in Algeria in 1952‚Äì53; he participated in several of their international workcamps and even became the head of their Algerian branch for some time. This provided him with an enduring philosophical background (see infra) and also with an important network of trusted friends who would be of great assistance to him through the events of the 1950s. Mohamed Sahnoun then resumed his studies at New York University where he obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Master of Arts degrees, both in political science.  Diplomatic career =At the service of Algeria= Mohamed Sahnoun first became diplomatic advisor of the Provisional Government of the Algerian Republic. In 1962 he travelled with president Ben Bella on his first official visit to the USA, where he met with president John Kennedy who had been one of the supporters of the cause of Algerian independence. As the Algerian delegation was then due to travel to Cuba, Kennedy showed Ben Bella the first secret pictures taken by U2 planes showing Russian missiles launch pads in Cuba. In the name of peace and human security, Ben Bella agreed to convey a message to Fidel Castro making clear how much the American regarded this situation as a casus belliAinsi √©tait le \\"Che\\" par Ahmed Ben Bella, Le Monde diplomatique, novembre 1997 .Interview de Mohamed Sahnoun par Katherine Marshall dans le Huffington Post le 10 mai 2011 Mohamed Sahnoun then held the following positions: *Deputy Secretary-General of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) (1964‚Äì1973) *Deputy Secretary-General of the League of Arab States in charge of Arab-Africa dialogue (1973‚Äì1975). *Algerian Ambassador to Federal Republic of Germany (1975‚Äì1979) *Algerian Ambassador to France (1979‚Äì1982).

During his tenure, he organised a state visit by president Chadli Bendjedid to Ronald Reagan, the first official visit ever of an Algerian head of state to the United States. *In 1989, Sahnoun is called to take over urgently as Algeria's Ambassador to Morocco, in order to succeed ambassadeur Abdelhamid Mehri, who is himself urgently requested to take the presidency of FLN after the 1988 October riots in Algeria; he becomes simultaneously Algerian Ambassador to Morocco and secretary of the Arab Maghreb Union (1989‚Äì1990). *His name was mentioned as a possible recourse candidate for the Algerian presidential election of April 1999 but it is finally Abdelaziz Bouteflika, a former foreign minister who had retired from public office since 1981, who stood as a \\" free candidate \\" for and from FLN.Phillip C.

In this position, the efficiency of his diplomatic style is unanimously recognised and promising results are achieved; however his peacebuilding action was interrupted by the lack of efficient backing from the UNIn his book entitled \\"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\\", Mohamed Sahnoun clearly showed that when the United Nations tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies, their main Somalia envoys operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi. The refusal of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, then UN Secretary General to accept this criticism led to the early end of Mohamed Sahnoun's mission in Somalia and by the US military impatience to intervene. Mohamed Sahnoun resigned in protest. The intervention led by the US-backed Unified Task Force (code-named Operation Restore Hope) actually ended in utter disaster.Interview of Mohamed Sahnoun et Cornelio Sommaruga by Richard Werly and Fran√ßois d'Alan√ßon, in Oser la Paix, √âditions Autrement, Paris, 2011, , p.

(Following the Rwanda genocide, the Canadian government established the International Commission on Intervention and State Sovereignty (ICISS) in September 2000 under the joint presidency of Gareth Evans and Mohamed Sahnoun. In February 2001, the ICISS suggested the phrase \\"responsibility to protect\\" as a way to avoid the \\"right to intervene\\" or \\"obligation to intervene\\" doctrines and yet keep a degree of duty to act to resolve humanitarian crises.Haines, Steven; Kassimeris, George, ed.

Books *In 1994, Mohamed Sahnoun published \\"Somalia: The Missed Opportunities\\",USIP Press Books, octobre 1994, a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali civil war in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the United Nations tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations' excessive caution and bureaucratic inefficiencies. If radical reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation.Book Review by Gail M. Gerhart in Foreign Affairs, March/April 1995 *In 2007, Mohamed Sahnoun also published (in French) a largely autobiographic novel set in Algeria in 1954, M√©moire bless√©e ('‚ÄôHurt Memory'‚Äô); its main character, Salem, '‚Äôa man of faith and dialogue'‚Äô, is jailed and tortured because of his convictions. He is however rescued by French people, some civilian, some military and some ecclesiactic ‚Äì who all take great risks to shield him. The book is clearly an evocation of the events which marked the author's younger years (see above the early years and Algeria wars section), but it also calls for human solidarity and the protection of the weaker.; Presses de la Renaissance, Paris, 2007, Philosophy Mohamed Sahnoun met pacifism in 1952 in Alger through the Service Civil International NGO. He had read the book by Pierre Ceresole, the Swiss founder of this organisation, and even more importantly the book by Romain Rolland on Gandhi, \\"which was practically my bedside book at the time.Interview dans Breaking down barriers 1945‚Äì1975, 30 years of voluntary service for peace with Service Civil International, Olivier Bertrand, Paris, 2008 (in French) \\" These ideas stayed with him through his long professional career, where he was from the onset a man of dialogue, trying for instance to establish appropriate communication between communities about Congo through the UNESCO-backed World Assembly of Youth (WAY), or as a leading figure of the OAU, particularly when African countries were confronted with the problems stemming from the borders inherited from colonialism, or in his different missions for the UN. His participation for several years in the very international and religiously mixed Service Civil International NGO also played a role in his understanding the sources of conflict and brought him to invest in how to heal the memory injuries resulting from past conflicts. He reinforces further this reflection in his later career years as he more and more commits in favour of human security, for instance though The Responsibility to Protect project (2001) or through his organizing from 2008 to 2012 of the Caux Forum for Human Security, with the following five themes: Healing Memory, Just Governance, Living Sustainably, Inclusive Economics and Intercultural Dialogue Very committed to interreligious diversity and dialogue, Mohamed Sahnoun rose strongly against the idea of Clash of Civilizations, saying for example: \\"I said to Huntington during a discussion in Washington, there is no such clash. Take the Somalian example: from a religious point of view, Somalis are more or less all on the same wavelength. But because of total insecurity, they split into clans and sub-clans. That's why I want to develop intercultural and inter-religious dialogue. \\" Distinctions *A secondary school bears his name in the city of Oued Sly in Chlef, Algeria, his birthplace. *2007 \\"Elizabeth Haub Prize for Environmental Diplomacy\\" (link is external)'.

Tauscher worked in Cologne and was removed from her position after she converted to Roman Catholicism in 1888 so founded a religious order in the Netherlands upon choosing the Carmelite charism for her life. Her beatification was held in mid-2006 in the Netherlands. Life Anna Maria Tauscher van den Bosch was born in the German Confederation on 19 June 1855 to Hermann Traugott Tauscher and Pauline van den Bosch. Tauscher came from a religious background for her father was a Protestant pastor. From 1885 to 1888 she worked with those suffering mental disabilities at an institution in Cologne, but lost her job following her conversion. On 30 October 1888 she was baptized into the Roman Catholic Church. Tauscher founded the Carmelite Sisters of the Divine Heart of Jesus on 2 July 1891 after having opened a home for neglected children just prior to that in Berlin. She made her vows in 1893. The nun took for a model Saint Teresa of √Åvila. Her new order took on the Carmelite charism to the fullest and coupled it with apostolic service. Her concern was directed to poor and neglected children in addition to families and individuals who had left the Church. Her order was also focused on immigrants and the aged. She published 'The Servant of God'. Tauscher moved to the Netherlands in 1899 to expand her congregation and to continue her work; the order was later aggregated to the Discalced Carmelites on 25 October 1904 and it later received the decree of praise from Pope Pius X on 9 May 1910. Pope Pius XI granted papal approval to the order on 12 May 1930. Tauscher died on 20 September 1938. In 2005 there were 454 religious in 53 houses in nations such as Iceland and Nicaragua. Beatification The beatification process opened in Roermond in an informative process that was launched in the diocese on 2 February 1953 and was later concluded on 20 September 1957; the Congregation for the Causes of Saints validated this process in Rome on 15 May 1987 while later receiving the Positio dossier from the postulation in 1992. Theologians assented to the cause on 25 June 2002 as did the C.C.S. members on 1 October 2002. The confirmation of her life of heroic virtue allowed for Pope John Paul II to title her as Venerable on 20 December 2002. The process for a miracle spanned from 14‚Äì27 March 2002 and this received C.C.S. validation on 4 October 2002. A medical board approved the miracle on 11 March 2004 with theologians to follow on 10 July 2004; the C.C.S. also supported it on 11 January 2005. Pope Benedict XVI approved this on 19 December 2005 and delegated Cardinal Adrianus Johannes Simonis to preside over the beatification in the Netherlands on 13 May 2006. Her liturgical feast was not affixed to her date of death as is the norm but on the date of her entrance into the Church. The current postulator for this cause is Fr. Bonifatius Honings.

Haber's abilities as a teacher and mentor were acknowledged by the Economic History Association, which at its 2013 meeting awarded him the Jonathan R. Hughes Prize for Excellence in Teaching.  Current Work  Haber's work has focused on how regulatory and supervisory agencies are often used by incumbent firms to stifle competition, thereby curtailing economic opportunities and slowing technological progress. His most recent book (coauthored with Charles Calomiris), Fragile by Design: The Political Origins of Banking Crises and Scarce Credit, examines why governments often choose to craft banking regulatory policies in ways that stifle competition and increase systemic risk. Haber is currently at work in two research areas. One is the impact of geography on the evolution of societies' fundamental economic and political institutions. His research in this area has been featured in the mainstream press. His other current area of interest is the impact of the U.S. patent system on innovation and competition among firms.

In this process, cells are tagged with magnetic nanoparticles (nanoshuttle) that are used to render them magnetic. Once magnetic, these cells can be rapidly printed into specific 3D patterns using external magnetic forces that mimic tissue structure and function. General principle There are several advantages to using magnetic 3D bioprinting over other 3D printing modalities such as extrusion, photolithography, and stereolithography. This includes the rapid bioprinting process (15 min ‚Äì 1 h) compared to the days-long processes of others; the endogenous synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM) without the need of an artificial protein substrate; and fine spatial control. Using this system, 3D cell culture models can be rapidly printed, from simple spheroids and rings, to more complex organotypic models, like of the lung, aortic valve, and fat. History The first commercially available 3D bioprinting system is being commercialized by Nano3D Biosciences, Inc. The first application of this system is for high-throughput and high-content drug screening. Process The cells first need to be incubated in the presence of magnetic nanoparticles to make them more susceptible to manipulation through magnetic fields. The system developed by Nano3D Biosciences uses a \\"nanoshuttle\\" which is a nanoparticle assembly consisting of gold, magnetic iron oxide, and poly-L-lysine which assists in adhesion to the cell membrane via electrostatic interactions. In this system, cells are magnetically printed into 3D patterns (rings or dots) using fields generated by permanent magnets. The cells within the printed construct interact with surrounding cells and the ECM to migrate, proliferate, and ultimately shrink the structure, typically within 24 hours. When used as a toxicity assay, this shrinkage varies with drug concentration and is a label- free metric of cell function that can be easily captured and measured with brightfield imaging. In the system developed by Nano3D Biosciences, the size of the pattern can be captured using an iPod-based system, which is programmed using a freely available app (Experimental Assistant) to image whole plates of up to 96 structures at small intervals (as small as 1 s) to efficiently capture pharmacodynamics. Results employing magnetic 3D bioprinting were recently published in Scientific Reports in October 2013. =Diamagnetophoresis= Cells can be assembled without using magnetic nanoparticles by employing diamagnetism. Some materials are strongly attracted, or susceptible, to magnets than others. Materials with higher magnetic susceptibility will experience stronger attraction to a magnet and move towards it. The weakly attracted material with lower susceptibility is displaced to lower magnetic field regions that lie away from the magnet. By designing magnetic fields and carefully arranged magnets, it is possible to use the differences in the magnetic susceptibilities of two materials to concentrate only one within a volume. An example is to be found in the work where a bioink was formulated by suspending human breast cancer cells in a cell culture medium that contained the paramagnetic salt, diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid gadolinium (III) dihydrogen salt hydrate (Gd-DTPA). Like most cells, these breast cancer cells are much more weakly attracted by magnets than Gd-DTPA, which is an FDA-approved MRI contrast agent for use in humans. Therefore, when a magnetic field was applied, the salt hydrate moved towards the magnets, displacing the cells to a predetermined area of minimum magnetic field strength, which seeded the formation of a 3D cell cluster. Application Magnetic 3D bioprinting can be used to screen for cardiovascular toxicity, which accounts for 30% of drug withdrawals. Vascular smooth muscle cells are magnetically printed into 3D rings to mimic blood vessels that can contract and dilate. This system could potentially replace experiments using ex vivo tissue, which are costly and yield few data per experiment. Furthermore, magnetic 3D bioprinting can use human cells to approximate a human in vivo response better than with an animal model. This has been demonstrated by the bioassay which combines the benefits of 3D bioprinting in building tissue-like structures for study with the speed of magnetic printing. Users The target users for magnetic 3D bioprinting are in the pharmaceutical and CRO industries, where this system can be integrated early in the drug discovery process as a compound screen for toxicity and efficacy. In the future, magnetic 3D bioprinting could be applied to the field of regenerative medicine and organogenesis. Overall, magnetic 3D bioprinting is an effective tool to create faithful models of native tissue.

Ioanid was a political prisoner of the communist-led regime after the Second World War and spent 12 years in prison and labour camps. He is best known for taking part at the 1953 Cavnic labor camp escape and for his book \\"Give us each day our daily prison\\" (√énchisoarea noastrƒÉ cea de toate zilele), a reference to the verse from the Christian Lord's Prayer. The book is a comprehensive recollection of his time spent in detention. He is considered a Romanian Solzhenitsyn, as his description of the communist detention regime in Romania is the most detailed one submitted by one of its victims. Biography Ioanid was born on 28 March 1926 at his father's estate in IlovƒÉ»õ village, Mehedin»õi County. His godfather was Octavian Goga, a friend of his father, TilicƒÉ Ioanid. TilicƒÉ Ioanid was descended from an old and well- known Greek landlord family, a National Liberal Party member and a secretary in the Romanian government led by Miron Cristea before the World War II. Ioanid attended primary school in IlovƒÉ»õ, then continued his studies in Bucharest, the first six years at Saint Sava National College, and the last two at Spiru Haret High School. He received his bachelor's degree in 1944, at the »òi»ôe»ôti village school, where both teachers and students sought shelter from the allied bombardment. In 1945 he enrolled in law school, but was expelled in the third year because of his \\"unhealthy social origin\\", as his father was a landlord. Ioanid was first arrested in 1949, but was released a few days later. In 1952 he was arrested again, and this time sentenced to 20 years of forced labour. He spent the next 12 years in several prisons and labor camps, and was released in 1964, following a pardon decree targeting political prisoners. He left Romania in 1969 and sought political asylum in West Germany. There, he worked for 20 years as a Romanian announcer and journalist for Radio Free Europe. Give us each day our daily prison= 1949. First arrest= He was arrested for the first time for facilitating the typewriting of two letters. The first, from his cousin George Boian, containing economic, political and military information about the situation of Romania at the time, was addressed to a friend outside of the country. The second, from his close friend Baby Ivanovici, was addressed to the Remington Company in the United States. When Boian was arrested, the letters were found upon him, and as such Ioanid was also involved. He was detained at Malmaison prison, in Bucharest, where his investigation was held. Beaten and tortured into admitting his part in the so-called plot ‚Äî the other persons involved were cross-examined in parallel, and any lie told with the intent of protecting the others was eventually revealed ‚Äî he was released a few days later. = 1952. Second arrest. Pite»ôti prison and trial= Following the purge in May 1952 of the Vasile Luca, Ana Pauker and Teohari Georgescu group, a new wave of political trials was initiated and Ioanid was again arrested. Taken with the entire Boian group to the Securitate regional headquarters in Pite»ôti, he was part of a mock trial led by general Alexandru Petrescu, who also led the trial against Iuliu Maniu. Eventually Ioanid was sentenced to 20 years forced labor. After the trial, regardless of its location, as it was the procedure back then, the convicts were transferred to the Jilava prison via railroad. Days or weeks could pass before a suitable train was available. From Jilava, they were assigned to either prisons or labor camps all over the country, as the conviction stated. After the trial, the prisoners were no longer detained at the Securitate location, but moved to the local prison. For Ioanid, the Pite»ôti prison detention, although a short one this time, compared to future detentions, was the first contact with a communist prison. As he was only a temporary prisoner here, and the worst of the brainwashing experiments performed in this facility were terminated earlier the same year, he was not subject to them. However, it was the first contact with the brutality of the prison guards, as \\"it was pouring curses and fists, generously distributed to all those who were not executing orders fast enough\\", with the strictness of the detention, as the inmates were not allowed to talk loud to each other, sing, look outside the window, attempt to communicate with other cells, lay down in bed during the day, or perform many other ordinary tasks. They were tortured, either directly ‚Äî beating and isolation were commonplace ‚Äî or indirectly, with bad food or malnutrition, lack of hygiene, deprivation of almost all or any medical care. Opening the prison cell during the night was not allowed for guards except in the presence of a higher rank officer, and only in exceptional cases: severe injury or death, so emptying the bucket was not possible. The content was spilled over the window, which led to a pestilential odor all over the prison. Starting here, and then through all the detention places, Ioanid makes vivid portrayals of the inmates he met, from simple peasants who opposed the nationalization process, to former members of the historical parties, from citizens who were unfortunate enough to have an unhealthy origin, or make an out-of-place remark towards the communist leadership, to Iron Guard members, all victims of the communist purging machine. =1952. Jilava prison= In early October 1952, Ioanid was moved from Pite»ôti to Jilava prison. The transport train arrived once in a while, and it was many times the case that those transported were crowded in the small compartments: \\"When they started pushing the ninth prisoner, we were downright crushed, barely able to breathe. [...] The highest price for closing the door was paid by the ones positioned closest [...] they were savagely beaten with clubs and fists. Blood was all over their faces\\". On arrival in Bucharest, they spent one night in the common-law designated prison of VƒÉcƒÉre»ôti, before being moved to Jilava. Ioanid's first Jilava stage lasted about six weeks. At the time of his stay \\"...commander in chief was captain Maromet. Of Gagauz origin, heavily tuttering, he was famous for his cruelty and sadism. Personally beating the inmates, his favourite torture was that, during summer, he had the windows of the overcrowded cells nailed closed, until, because of heat exhaustion and lack of air, people started to faint\\". In the middle of November, he was assigned to a batch of 150 prisoners that were to be transferred to a new labor camp at Cavnic mine, in Maramure»ô County. The requirements for the lot were such that the prisoners would be capable of hard mine work: they had to be younger than 35, healthy and with convictions exceeding 15 years. However, in the end, the numbers had to be completed with men crippled and up to 60 years old. = 1953. Escape from Cavnic labor camp= From Jilava, the prisoners were transferred to the Cavnic mine labor camp, in northwest Romania, close to another, older, labor camp at Baia Sprie. Before World War II, the Cavnic mine belonged to a Romanian- Belgian company, which closed down the facility because of low profitability. Subsequently, the Baia Sprie Mining Plant decided to reopen it. They provided the technical and logistic guidance, while the Ministry of Internal Affairs provided the labor force, consisting of political detainees. Aside the Jilava lot, also a group of older prisoners, from the Baia Sprie camp, was assigned to start work at this new mining facility. There were also civilian miners working there. The civilian work force was concentrated at the -100 meter work front, while the labor camp force, completely isolated from the first, was concentrated at the -200 meter work front. At first, as part of the overall experiment, the prisoners were housed in brand-new huts and even overfed. They were told by the administration that the civilized behaviour towards them, detention comfort and food amount depended on the level of the performed work quota. Coming from prisons all over the country where personal space was very restricted, and where cold and famine were regular, the inmates started working hard, raising the workload on a daily basis. In time, the food quality and quantity worsened, and so did the administration's behavior towards them. They were not able to meet the high workload anymore, and this also led to conflicts with newly arrived inmates, who were accusing the old ones of Stakhanovism. Ioanid gives a detailed description of work techniques and equipment during the daily shift. However, there was always a competition between the camp administration and the prisoners. The first wanted high work output, while the latter wanted to work as little as possible, to avoid injuries and prevent overwork-related health issues. The inmates used any possible means to sabotage the work effort: intentionally damaging the equipment, reporting false ‚Äì bigger ‚Äì quotas or not reporting rich ore veins when discovered so that they could be slowly exploited. Working underground was difficult, depending on the exploited vein, temperatures and humidity could be very high, or freezing cold water could pour from the ceiling. Mining accidents were frequent and many died or were maimed. Mining-related diseases were also common. Those who opposed the administration were punished with cruelty: Not being committed to a tight-security prison, Ioanid was determined to take the necessary risks and attempt an escape. Meanwhile, he befriended several other prisoners, some of whom expressed similar thoughts. Eventually they formed a group and planned to escape the following spring. The group consisted of: * Ion Pantazi: captured during an attempt to illegally cross the border and sentenced to 5 years of forced labor. Part of the Baia Sprie group. * Constantin Co≈üereanu (Titi): fought during the war with the German forces on the Baltic front line (as he was a student in a German Military School). His sister was married to an American assigned to the military mission in Bucharest, and through this route he was providing unfiltered and uncensored information about the Communist authorities' actions in the country. Captured and sentenced to more than 20 years of forced labor. * Ion and Simion Cojocaru, brothers. They were given heavy sentences for taking part in the uprising that followed the nationalization of peasant property in Vrancea County. * Ion and Gheorghe Br√Ænzaru, brothers. Same as above. * Colea Ungureanu * George Sarry * Mircea Vueric * Dr. Miltiade Ionescu (Mache) * Dr. Paul IovƒÉnescu * Alexandru Cioc√¢lteu (Ducu), sentenced to more than 20 years during the staged trial against the Vatican nunciature in Bucharest. As they arrived at the camp in late autumn, the plan was to wait for early summer in order to escape. Escaping during winter posed several problems, such as no shelter in the leafless forest, freezing temperatures and no possibility to cover the snow tracks. This was a period, after the second world war, when Romania was completely isolated from outside information flow. At the dawn of the Cold War, people still believed that Allied forces would start a new war against the Soviet Union and this war could lead to freedom (the Vin americanii! notion). As such, after escape, almost all planned to join the guerilla forces that were still active in the mountains or attempt to flee across the border towards the West. The group of prisoners escaped on 6 June 1953. Taking advantage of the poor security inside the mine, they managed to get out during the shift change using a tunnel destined for the civil miners. They met no resistance except one guard and a civil engineer, whom they overpowered and tied up. Outside the mine, they split up. Ioanid, Co»ôereanu, Vueric and Ion Cojocaru eventually regrouped, but after a few days, they split up again, Ioanid and Co≈üereanu being the ones that stayed free for the longest period. Most of the escapees managed to slip outside of the area where the secret police started patrolling after they noticed the missing prisoners. All were eventually captured, some at the Soviet border, where they arrived by mistake, some during police raids, and some even betrayed by their own family. From Cavnic, they headed east, across Maramure»ô County and the Rodna Mountains, feeding on what they received from the shepherds and peasants they met; most of whom, despite the escapees' efforts to conceal it, recognized they were fugitives. After 18 days, on 24 June, they reached Iacobeni village, from where, with money received from the local priest, they bought train tickets to Bucharest, arriving there the next day. = 1953. Capture. Baia Mare inquiry= In Bucharest, Ioanid had several acquaintances, either family, school friends of people his father had assisted. The first month they lived in the apartment of a good family friend, Constantin Boceanu. Boceanu had left the city for the summer, and his landlady ‚Äì knowing about the escape from Ioanid's confession ‚Äì insisted they would stay there until his return. Before Boceanu got back, Ioanid's mother managed to find them a new hideout, in the house of Ani≈£a and Dinu Hariton. There was no detailed plan on how to continue from here on. One possibility was to attempt an escape towards west, by hiding on a barge that transported timber to Austria, with the help of Rici Tailer, who apparently specialized in such actions. During the three-month stay in Bucharest, they visited several friends and also relatives of the people they had met in incarceration, giving them information about the whereabouts and health of their family members, information that was not officially available because of the secret service censorship. They avoided meeting with close family members, as they might have been under police surveillance. Leaving the capital or travelling around was difficult without official identification papers. Through the help of underground organisations, they tried to obtain fake identification, and Ioanid managed to get work at a building site at DrƒÉgƒÉ»ôani, V√¢lcea County in early September. Here fictitious employees were listed on the payroll by bribing the officials. However, one of the clandestine outfits they used to obtain fake identification was uncovered, and this lead took the police to the Hariton family. When returning from DrƒÉgƒÉ»ôani, on 13 September, Ioanid was arrested. Held for more than a month in Bucharest, Ioanid and Co»ôereanu (who had been arrested before Ioanid) were moved to Baia Mare, in Maramure»ô County. Thinking they would be sent back to Cavnic, here they were again cross-examined, when it became clear ‚Äì a conclusion derived from the investigators' questions ‚Äì that most, if not all, of the escapees had been captured. His only work, 'Give us each our daily prisons' is a comprehensive recollection of the time spent in detention. =1953‚Äì1954. Oradea prison= After the investigation at Baia Mare, the two were sent to Oradea prison, which \\"[...] was in fact a dungeon, reminiscent of the Hungarian times, with one meter thick walls and iron bars latticed windows, behind which, visible from the outside, the broken glass and peeled plaster gave the impression of a deserted building.\\" Here they reunited with the rest of the escapees, who had also been recaptured. During the cross- examination preceding the trial, it became clear that one of them was a denouncer, as the investigators had a very deep insight about the escape plans, connections between the Cavnic prisoners and civilian workers and personal details about the escapees. It turned out that the culprit was Alexandru Cioc√¢lteu, a surprise at first for Ioanid, since Ducu was one of the most actively involved prisoners in the escape planning. After his capture, the same qualities that his colleagues appreciated, intelligence and energy, were turned against those he had helped to escape. Aside the 13 escapees, also the civilians and other prisoners who helped them escape were held at Oradea. This way, it was possible to find out what were the consequences of their actions on the other prisoners at Cavnic. Although their ordeal worsened, with daily raids and searching through the barracks, increased and impossible quotas in the mine, as well as hardened punishments for every small act of defiance, the inmates did not show grudge on the group and had unanimous support towards their actions. All the members of the group had received previously severe terms in prison, so for some there was the fear that the Cavnic incident may lead to the capital punishment. As the strongest supporter of this idea, Cioc√¢lteu tried to convince the others that the best solution would be to show full cooperation with the secret police. On the other side, the rest of the group had no intention on cooperating with the authorities, and put pressure on Cioc√¢lteu so he would withdraw the statements made during the inquiry. He was treated as an informer, a snitch, which was one of the worst offenses within the prison walls. As a result, during the following trial, trying to please both parts, he made confusing statements, which only helped the prosecution, used to manipulate ambiguous statements to its advantage. In the end, Ioanid's sentence was one year for prison escaping, five years for use of explosives (which, although he manufactured, he did not use) and eight years for political conspiracy in prison. The first two sentences were merged in the highest one and three years were added for aggravating circumstances, in the end resulting in additional eleven years to serve. Later, this conviction was merged to the previous one of 20 years hard labor. The incarceration conditions were severe, as the winter of 1953‚Äì1954 was very cold. In addition, the food was scarce and non-nutritious. As it was the general understanding of the prisoners, their chances of survival were low in these conditions, so they decided, paradoxically, that the only solution not to die of starvation would be to go on hunger strike. Still, the attempt was only partially successful. After a few days, realizing that the management was not yielding towards any concessions, and scared at the prospect of force- feeding, they gave up on the strike. \\"Sitting up, walking down the hallway and especially going down the stairs happened as inside a nightmare, when you want to step down or do whatever other movement and the limbs are not responding to your intentions. I could not control the size of the step, nor its general direction. Everything was happening as in a slow motion film.\\". Although it was officially a failure, the strike had resulted in some improved prison conditions, especially in terms of food. = 1954‚Äì1955. Aiud prison= In May 1954, following the new conviction, Ioanid was moved from Oradea to the Aiud prison, the destination of political prisoners considered most dangerous: \\"Its reputation was well established. The prison of all prisons. It became a symbol. The Holy of Holies.\\" Here the isolation from the outside world was the most severe. The Aiud detention center consisted of several buildings, the oldest of which was reserved for political detainees. Its nickname was Zarca (from Hungarian z√°rka, meaning solitary). The regime here, in terms of food and authorities vigilance, was more relaxed at first than at Oradea. The increased quantity of food helped the dystrophy suffering inmates recover and it was possible, with extra care, contrary to prison rules, to get short periods of sleep also during the day. The intentions of the regime became clear with time. The prison doctor was Cornel Petrasievici, an inmate himself and former colleague of some of the Cavnic mine group at the Baia Sprie labor camp and a close friend. He was well respected for his professional and ethical integrity. As many of the prisoners had severe health issues, it was his task to request the proper medication to the prison overseers who brought them from the outside. However, for certain detainees, it was always reported that medication was not available. As such, if he would prescribe the needed medication on someone else's file, the medicine was approved, showing thus that some were explicitly marked for extermination. One graphic account is that of the suffering of Radu Gyr. Aside from physical exhaustion, he was also suffering from rectal prolapse. \\"I clearly recall Cornel's words: 'after every stool, his intestine was forty centimeters on the outside'.\\" Patrasievici had to fix the problem using only a washstand with warm water. During one of the many solitary punishments received while in Aiud, Ioanid recollects being sent to a room where he managed to contact his neighbors, by talking close to the window bars. In one cell, the prisoner was novelist and memoirist Constantin Gane, who later died in the Aiud prison in 1962, while in the other one it was poet, playwright, essayist and journalist Gyr. Pite≈üti prison, where Ioanid spent 6 years. It functioned as a detention facility until 1977. Abandoned and partially in ruin, the building was sold to a construction company in 1991. = 1955‚Äì1960. Pite≈üti prison= Beginning of 1955, Ioanid and Co≈üereanu were moved from Aiud to Jilava. Here, they attended the trial of Ioanid's mother and M.C., both accused of not denouncing them while hiding in Bucharest, after the Cavnic escape. Although their presence was not required, the defense attorney, Benea, managed to get them transferred there through a bureaucratic wrinkle. Ioanid was arrested in Bucharest and his arrest file was initiated there, but later he stood trial in Oradea, where a new file was documented. Due to excessive bureaucracy, the Bucharest court was not yet informed about the sentence from Oradea and as such they were called in to appear in court again. In the courtroom, Benea presented the sentence to the judge, and the trial did not take place; yet, under these circumstances, Ioanid was able to meet with his mother. From Jilava, they were not sent back to Aiud, but to the Pite≈üti prison. Again, with the specter of rehabilitation in sight, they found worse conditions there than at Aiud. As in Oradea, when the incarceration conditions worsened, the inmates decided to go on hunger strike. The initiative was met with general endorsement, as with extreme care ‚Äì and occasional retaliation when caught ‚Äì it was possible to communicate with other cells and coordinate such an activity. The demands were: court case review after the file statements that were obtained by means of torture are removed, a retrial and the right to choose the defense attorney, citation of the prosecution witnesses and hearing them in court, medical treatment for the sick, improved diet, the right to write and receive letters, to speak with members of the family and the right to receive and own books and writing materials, among others. Undergoing such an endeavor was risky, as usually such actions were followed by prison staff retaliation, best case targeted only towards those who initiated it, worst case targeted towards all the prisoners, many old and weak. At the start of the strike, in May 1956, some 150‚Äì160 prisoners reported they would not eat the received food, which totaled almost half of the prison political detainees. The management reacted with the usual response, ranging from threats (of violence, new terms, solitary), promises of better conditions (which usually lasted only for a limited period) or attempting to set discord among the strike group. Many gave up on the strike, but at least 56 continued. Of course, the management could not give into all the demands, and as such it finally came to force-feeding. Ioanid recalls his own personal experience of the ordeal: \\"At the very first sip, when the tube Ciortan was pushing barely passed the larynx, the involuntary contraction of the esophagus in contact with rubber was so violent, that in an instant, feeling as if choking, I pulled it out. [...] While trying to regain my breathing, holding back on the cough and queasiness, Ciortan threatened he would have me tied to the chair unless I kept my hands behind the back.\\" The process was repeated several times before the strike ended. This time, there were several concessions made by the management: the diet got better, a new set of clothes was received, the guards' vigilance lessened, and inmates were able to perform actions not possible before (sleep during the day, talk out loud or with other cells, make custom tools, etc.), the solitary stopped being used, so were chains and the sick were either treated in the prison hospital or, if the case was beyond local competence, moved to an external facility. Out of the almost 12 continuous years spent incarcerated, Ioanid spent the longest period in Pite≈üti. As for former detention places, detailed portrays of the political convicts and prison staff are presented here, as well. External political events of the age, such as the Hungarian Revolution of 1956, are presented through the eyes of inmates. As Romania was situated somewhat at the border between eastern and western blocks, every major event that could have adverse consequences towards the regime usually had two stages. At first, a slight improvement in the detention conditions would be observed, since the prison personnel feared the outcome of the event. As it was often proved, even for the perpetrators of the rehabilitation, it did not take much for the aggressor to end up behind bars. But if the events turned out favorable for the leaders, conditions suddenly went for the worse. Such was the case for the Soviet intervention in Budapest on the 4th of November 1956. In the aftermath, inmates were officially told, a prison first, that breaking the prison rules would lead to retaliation in the form of physical punishment. The prison staff behaviour fit the same general direction as in other political prisons. The warden was ‚Äì for most of the time, till after the strike, when he was replaced ‚Äì captain M√¢ndre≈ü, nicknamed Bogeyman due to his savage attitude towards the prisoners. The staff's actions were as abusive as possible. Medical care, actually the lack of it, always reminded the inmates how little life was valued in there. In the unhygienic prison conditions, boils were a common problem. When treated, it was usually in an advanced stage, and surgery was necessary. No anesthesia was used, just alcohol and a knife. Aside from excruciating pain, this often led to further infections. But the refusal of medical care was a very efficient execution method. Such was the case of Alexandru Bal≈ü, suffering from asthma. Every now and then, he received a few ephedrine pills, which helped, but not enough for a continuous treatment. In time, he got weak and \\"As time passed by, without the administration taking any sort of action towards saving his life, it became clear for us that Bal≈ü was deliberately sentenced to death, the sentence being carried out through lack of medical care.\\". After weeks of agony, by the time it was already too late, he finally got the proper medical attention from the prison doctors. Unable to move, his cell colleagues had to sign for his medicine; later, after his death, this was recorded as proof that he did, in fact, receive the necessary treatment. The medical training of the prison doctor was such that, when Colonel Mihai Kiriacescu suffered a cardiac arrest ‚Äì and resuscitation did not help ‚Äì his colleagues requested him having an adrenaline shot; the injection was done by the medic in charge, Ciortan, half an hour later, intramuscularly, in his thigh. The ordeal was both physical and mental, and the inmates tried to resist it through any possible means. Communication with other cells through Morse code helped them receive valuable information about their friends, while the need to communicate with the outside world, by any means, was insatiable. Pavel Constantin, a fellow inmate and fried, who was released while Ioanid was incarcerated in Pite≈üti, proposed to him a method of receiving information from the outside. Since it was possible to observe, from the prison cell window, the street outside the walls, it would be feasible to send from there messages, Morse coded, inside the facility. After release, Constantin went to Ioanid's mother and, at well established times, once a month, she applied this method. As it was very difficult and ineffective ‚Äì the distance was great and it was hard to make out the body gestures needed to emulate the signals ‚Äì as well as very risky, this happened only a few times, before giving up on the procedure. There was even a revue staged during one New Year's Eve, inside Ioanid's cell, with sketches and poetry, music and satire towards the prison staff. Dark humor was highly appreciated in prison. = 1960‚Äì1962. Timi≈üoara prison= House on C.D. Loga street, Timi≈üoara, with a memorial in front. The text translated to These houses were the headquarters of the Communist Secret Police, where the sons of the Romanian people, who opposed Bolshevik satanization, were tortured and killed. In April 1960, Ioanid was moved from Pite≈üti to Timi≈üoara, where he was subjected to a new secret police investigation regarding his involvement in the Ion Baicu group. After the war, the anti-communist resistance was known to Ioanid, although from his accounts it does not appear that he took part in any actions. For some time, General Aurel Aldea sought shelter at the IlovƒÉ»õ residence in order to organize the resistance, and although George Boian was his main confidant, Ioanid was also aware of the plans made there. Ioanid met Baicu in Bucharest, and recommending himself as a fugitive Iron Guard member, he met all the necessary qualities to get him trusted. During the following months, the group around Baicu ‚Äì Ioanid included ‚Äì met several times, but aside from making plans, there was no further outcome. Finally, before the group was dismantled, Ioanid took part in several shipments of weaponry from Bragadiru, a town near the capital, to Bucharest. It is for these actions that he was questioned again in Timi≈üoara. His investigator was Lieutenant Aurel Jerca, and, until the trial, he was detained at the local secret police quarters, on the C.D. Loga boulevard. In order to avoid being tortured, as in previous interrogations, he was advised on how to simulate suffering from angina. Due to the inherent risk of death that such diseases posed in case of physical torture, investigators avoided it in case of suffering prisoners. During the trial, he admitted being part of the Baicu group, but denied all involvement regarding the weapon shipment from Bragadiru. Baicu and Ioanid received the highest punishment of all the group, an additional twenty years of forced labor. After the trial, Ioanid was moved to the Popa »òapcƒÉ prison in Timi≈üoara, where he remained incarcerated until 1962. = 1962‚Äì1964. Salcia labor camp= In the early spring of 1962, Ioanid was moved from Timi»ôoara to Aiud, and then to Salcia labor camp, in BrƒÉila County. Very sick, Ioanid barely made it to the camp located in the Great BrƒÉila Island. Here, he was sent to work the very next day after arriving, doing corn weeding. Passing out on the field and taken to the camp hospital, he was diagnosed with tuberculosis by doctor Mihai Savu, a good friend of his father. A pleurisy was detected and he was subjected to thoracentesis, having 800g of fluid removed from around his lungs. Ioanid spent most of the summer under medical care, doing several errands for the doctors in the medical facility, thus avoiding the harsh work on the island. This would not be the only medical problem during the two years stay at Salcia as he also got infected during a leptospirosis epidemic, during the spring of 1964. Years prior to this epidemic, another one made several casualties among the inmates. This time, the authorities' reaction came sooner and, being treated with chloramphenicol, there were no victims. Assigned again to a labor camp, Ioanid experienced the same behavior and routines as in Cavnic. Stimulated by the authorities' violence and overall camp conditions, the attitude of the detainees, aimed towards self-preservation, led to mass sabotage and utterly inefficient work procedures. There are several episodes presented, such as wasting tons of pesticides as they are discarded over the fields on high winds (the only health-related measures being a toxic sign on the container bags), a whole crop of sunflower seeds being compromised because it was stored before it was well dried (yet the inmates told their guardians later about this, because in the storage house where the seeds were kept it was warm during winter, thus avoiding working on a different task out in the cold), prisoners, old and weary, being sent to harvest frogs for export, the one-day work resulting in two captures, and so on. And then there was the violence, hard and exhausting work, bad food, with dead flies forming a crust on the afternoon soup, rats running around the camp, causing foot spanking on the latrine floor, in order to scare them away, to become a natural habit. Arriving here, almost 10 years after the Cavnic events, the thought of escape rooted again. One considered possibility was swimming across the Danube to the mainland, into Northern Dobruja, then attempting to reach the southern border and flee into Bulgaria, then Greece. Still, several events that occurred showed that the age of political repression was coming to an end. Another labor camp, Gr«édina, was closed, and all the remaining inmates were moved to Salcia, suggesting that forced labor in the Great Island was about to be discontinued. Then, political propaganda got more aggressive, informing those who had rejected the fake image of communism, that the regime reported overall success through the country, praising its achievements. At first, prisoners were allowed to read Sc√Ænteia, the party newspaper, but when they ostentatiously refused to do so, it became mandatory practice by order of prison officials. =1964. Release= Following the general decree of amnesty towards political prisoners, Ioanid was released from prison on 29 July 1964. In 1969 he left Romania and took residence in Munich, where he lived until his death, in 2003. References in literature and television Ion Ioanid in particular and the Cavnic mine escape in general were the subject of the 28th episode of Memorialul Durerii television program, which aired on national television after the 1989 revolution, depicting the abuse of the communist party towards the Romanian people. The program was also made into a book, and a chapter is dedicated to Ioanid.

It was the first cotton spinning mill on the European mainland. Today it is an industrial museum specialising in textile history.  History  Br√ºgelmann, came from a rich Elberfelder trading family. He heard of the Waterframes, an invention of Richard Arkwright in the Derbyshire village of Cromford, in the early 1770s ‚Äì during a long stay in Basel. On his return to Wuppertal the cotton market was booming, it was impossible to fulfill the demand. Br√ºgelmann recognised the potential that Arkwright's mechanising of the labour-intensive Spinning process offered. As a rule of thumb each weaver needed all the yarn that 10 hand-spinners could produce. Richard Arkwright vigorously guarded his patent. He would not reveal how the water frame worked, keeping the details secret. Furthermore, the British Government saw this as a state secret that must not be allowed to leave the country..http://www.guelcher- chronik.de/Stichworter/Johann_Gottfried_Brugelmann/johann_gottfried_brugelmann.html Br√ºgelmann obtained a model of the Waterframe in 1783. He had already worked unsuccessfully for six years with experts from Siegerland to discover the workings of an Arkwright Carding machine: this made the sliver that was needed for the waterframe. It is unclear whether he got a model of this too, family papers suggest that he smuggled a spinner from Cromford over to Germany, with a collection of the parts needed to reconstruct the carding engine. In a letter to Prince-Elector Karl Theodor of the Palatinate and Bavaria he wrote he had a friend in England who had sent him the parts needed. Though it is possible that he worded this letter carefully, not leaving himself open to charges of Industrial espionage.  Construction  Br√ºgelmann looked for a suitable factory in the neighbourhood. In Wuppertal he was frustrated by a cartel of traders, with their rights to Garnnahrung\\" and subsequent trading restrictions. Eventually he found a deserted oil-mill in the village of Eckamp. This has water extraction rights on Angerbach. It was just outside the town walls of Ratingens, next to the moated castle of Haus zum Haus. The Count gave him 12 year exclusive rights to construct and operate a cotton-spinning mill in this building.(Br√ºgelmann had sought 40 year privileges, to compenste him for the initial investment). Recruiting a work-force in poverty stricken Ratingens was relatively simple: few said no to work and there was none of the rioting by weavers seen earlier in the decade in Elberfeld and Barmen. He built two spinning halls, alongside the River Angerbach, hired further English trained cotton workers to construct and operate water frames. In 1784, production started. All the machines were powered by waterwheels. He called the mill after the Derbyshire town. Today the area of Ratingen, between Hauser Ring, M√ºlheimer Stra√üe and Junkernbusch is called \\"Cromford\\". The business became prominent in the area: an imposing five storey factory building was erected, and then a luxurious villa for the owner costing 20.000 Reichstaler, (Herrenhaus in German). It also had a Baroque park, with an English Garden, laid out by . Ten years after the mill opened, it was employing 400 workers; at that time an unprecedented number for a business. It peaked in 1802 at 600, then the exclusive privileges expired, and other manufactures built bigger mills. After the death of Br√ºgelmann his sons continued the business. The business continued to expand and was still operating in the 1960s when the mill fell silent.  Current usage  Preparation of cotton fibers The additional modern buildings were demolished in the 1980s and replaced with housing. However the Herrenhaus, \\"Villa Cromford\\", and the original 5 storey factory, \\"Hohe Fabrik\\" remain. In 1983 an archaeological study was commissioned, and the important industrial location was documented. The buildings became part of the Rheinischen Industriemuseums.offizieller Name: ‚ÄûLVR-Industriemuseum, Schauplatz Ratingen, Textilfabrik Cromford‚Äú () Exact working replicas of all the important cotton machines from this time were installed in the old mill. All can be powered from the central waterwheel, and they can be seen working. Exhibitions on the history of the mill, the processes and the working conditions (including child labour) are on display.

The act allows a student to use medical marijuana on school grounds, on a school bus, or at a school activity if the student's primary caregiver possesses and administers medical marijuana in a non-smokable form to the student. The primary caregiver shall not administer the medical marijuana in a manner that is disruptive to the educational environment or causes exposure to other students. After the primary caregiver administers the medical marijuana, the primary caregiver shall remove any remaining medical marijuana from the grounds of the preschool or primary or secondary school, the school bus, or school sponsored event. The act allows a school district to adopt policies regarding who may be a primary caregiver and the permissible circumstances regarding the administration of the medical marijuana. The act does not apply to a school district or charter school if: ‚Ä¢ The school district or charter school loses federal funding as a result of implementing the act; ‚Ä¢ The school district or charter school can reasonably demonstrate that it lost federal funding as a result of implementing the act; and ‚Ä¢ The school district or charter school posts on its website in a conspicuous place a statement regarding its decision not to comply with the act.

The study team was led by Dr. Robert Roberts (cardiologist), who was president and CEO of the University of Ottawa Heart Institute from 2004-2014. Because of the settlement pattern and isolation of the province's population, Newfoundland has \\"big clusters\\" of certain genetic conditions, making it a focus of research in genetics. In 1998, one such \\"cluster\\" emerged in the community of Grand Falls, where a number of people were found to have ARVD and some died of the condition. A group of researchers from the Baylor College of Medicine arrived in Newfoundland to study the community. The group collected blood samples, family histories and electrocardiographs (EKGs) from community members in order to test for a particular biomarker indicating a genetic predisposition to the condition.Newfoundland and Labrador Department of Health and Community Services. (2003). Policy Implications of Commercial Human Genetic Research in Newfoundland and Labrador , 2003. Retrieved from https://www.phiareviewnl.ca/documents/Policy-Implications-of-Commercial-Human- Genetics-Research.pdf  Media Coverage  Due to the ethical concerns and the speed at which the sampling took place - the team flew in, collected the blood samples, and then flew out again within days of arriving - the local people and the media began referring to the researchers as the Texas Vampires. The story became the topic of an extensive radio broadcast by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. A Baylor official responded that \\"There can also be different interpretations of what is being said both by the research team and other family members. In many cases the concerns arise due to communications falling short during the entire process.\\" She added that although \\"current regulations do not demand the release of information...we are planning on providing all of the genetic information that we have\\". The team published an article in Circulation announcing the localization of the gene believed to be involved in ARVD. Members of the group later published another paper relating a different gene to the condition.  Ethical Concerns  During the study, participants voiced concerns about the way it was conducted, suggesting that the informed consent process had been rushed or even skipped, or that potential participants had been made to feel they might die if they did not take part. They also objected to not being given the results of the study: \\"the Baylor Research team should know who is at risk of those people they tested, of having the condition and those who do not...That information has not been made available to the families\\". Moreover, the patient records acquired upon performing their tests with the help of local hospitals were never shared with the patients' respective healthcare providers; such abstention of relevant medical information further aggravated the situation by preventing patients from receiving accurate follow-up care. The retention of test results, such as echocardiograms and 12 lead electrocardiographs, not only resulted in the premature death or uncontrolled illness of some participants, but also opened the discussion on whether researchers should be compelled to report any results with medical relevance.

As a player, he was considered at his best in low comedy. Thomas Ryder Early life The son of the actor-manager Preswick Ryder (d. 1771) and his actress wife Sarah, he was perhaps born in Nottinghamshire. He had early stage experience in Scotland, at least. The Dublin stage Ryder appeared on 7 December 1757 at Smock Alley Theatre, Dublin, then under the management of Thomas Sheridan, playing Captain Plume in The Recruiting Officer to the Captain Brazen of Samuel Foote. He came to immediate favour. After the failure of Sheridan, Ryder remained under his successor, Brown, supporting Frances Abington as Sir Harry in High Life Below Stairs (James Townley) and in other parts. Under Henry Mossop, he played at the same houseIn 1764 Tressel in King Richard III, Scapin, Lord Aimworth in Maid of the Mill (Isaac Bickerstaff), and Rimenes in the opera Artaxerxes. For five years Ryder then ran a company, working his way around Ireland. He reopened at Smock Alley Theatre as Sir John Restless in All in the Wrong (Arthur Murphy), and temporarily brought back prosperity to the management.Lionel in the opera so named, the title in Cymon, a dramatic romance attributed to David Garrick, and the Copper Captain in Rule a Wife and have a Wife, followed. During the slack season Ryder performed at Ranelagh Gardens (Dublin). Manager at Smock Alley Theatre In the autumn of 1772, Mossop having retired ruined, Ryder stepped into the management of Smock Alley Theatre, and opened in September with She Would and She Would Not, in which he played for the first time Trappanti. He was then declared to be the most general actor living for tragedy, comedy, opera, and farce. Ryder remained in management in Dublin, helped by a lottery prize in the early days, with varying but diminishing success, until 1782. When the Fishamble Street Theatre started to take his business, he had the words of The Duenna taken down in shorthand, producing it as The Governess. A legal action ensued, but failed. He kept a carriage, and a country house known as \\"Ryder's Folly\\" which he sold unfinished. He also started as printer, editing plays in which he appeared, printing them and publishing a tri-weekly theatrical paper. After trying in vain to manage Crow Street Theatre as well Smock Alley, Ryder yielded up Crow Street to Richard Daly, resigning management in 1782, and becoming a member of Daly's company. The London stage On 25 October 1787, at Covent Garden as Sir John Brute in The Provoked Wife, Ryder made his first appearance in England. His d√©but was not a conspicuous success, and a rival, John Edwin the elder, was the sitting tenant of many of his best parts. During his first season he repeated, however, many favourite characters.He was seen as Sir John Restless, Scapin, Ben in Love for Love, Falstaff in First Part of Henry IV, and Merry Wives of Windsor, Crispin in The Anatomist (James Bridie), Lissardo in The Wonder (Susannah Centlivre), Colonel Feignwell in A Bold Stroke for a Wife (Centlivre), Hob in Hob in the Well (Colley Cibber), Trim in The Funeral (Richard Steele), Tom in The Conscious Lovers (Steele), Lady Pentweazle in Lady Pentweazle in Town (William Kenrick), General Savage in The School for Wives, Drunken Colonel in The Intriguing Chambermaid (Henry Fielding), Captain Ironside in The Brothers (Richard Cumberland), Sir Harry's Servant in High Life below Stairs, Lovegold in The Miser (Fielding), and played an original part, unnamed, in Bonds without Judgment, attributed to Edward Topham, and Sebastian in Elizabeth Inchbald's Midnight Hour, on 22 May 1787. At Covent Garden, with one summer visit to the Haymarket, he remained until his death.He was seen as Iago, Duret√™te in The Inconstant (George Farquhar), Heartwell in The Old Bachelor (William Congreve), Bailiff in The Good-natured Man (Oliver Goldsmith), Shylock, Beau Clincher, Peachum, Don Jerome in The Duenna, Lopez in Lovers' Quarrels (adaptation to one act of The Mistake by Vanburgh, by Thomas King), Old Hardcastle, Major Benbow in The Flitch of Bacon (Henry Bate), Leon, Sir Tunbelly Clumsy in The Man of Quality (adaptation by John Lee from The Relapse by Vanburgh), Darby in The Poor Soldier (William Shield), with other characters; and at the Haymarket, where he made as Shylock his first appearance on 22 June 1790, as Sidney, an original character in a farce called Try Again, Don Lopez, an original part in John Scawen's two-act opera, New Spain, or Love in Mexico, and the Marquis de Champlain (also original) in O'Keeffe's Basket Maker. The main original parts he played at Covent Garden were: Carty in O'Keeffe's Tantarara Rogues All on 1 March 1768; Duke Murcia in Elizabeth Inchbald's Child of Nature on 28 November; and Hector in O'Keeffe's Pharo Table, on 4 April 1789. Death On 19 November 1790 Ryder played Old Groveby in the Maid of the Oaks. A week later (26 November 1790) he died at Sandymount, Dublin, and was buried in the churchyard of Drumcondra. Works Ryder was responsible for two plays: Like Master Like Man, a farce, Dublin, 1770; this was a reduction to two acts of John Vanbrugh's The Mistake, itself derived from Le D√©pit Amoureux; Samuel Reddish, who played it at Drury Lane on 12 April 1768, and it was revived at Drury Lane on 30 March 1773. His second piece, Such Things have been, a two-act comedy taken from Isaac Jackman's Man of Parts, was played by Ryder for his benefit at Covent Garden on 31 March 1789, and was printed. Family Ryder married before the season of 1771‚Äì2, when Mrs. Ryder was seen as Clementina, Constance in King John, Lady Macbeth, and other characters. Two daughters were for a short time on the stage at Covent Garden, appearing respectively, Miss Ryder as Estifania and Miss R. Ryder as Leonora to their father's Leon in Rule a Wife and have a Wife, on 16 April 1790. Ryder's son, who was in the army, was killed in 1796 in a duel.

Early years Fran√ßois-Xavier Joseph de Casabianca was born in Nice, Alpes-Maritimes, on 27 June 1796. His parents were Fran√ßois-Louis-Camille-Giocante de Casabianca (1776-1837) and Maria- Ilaria (1773-1835). He came from an old noble family of Corsica that had contributed to the annexation of that island to France. He was the nephew of General Rapha√´l, Comte de Casabianca. His uncle had been created a Count of the Empire in 1806. Joseph de Casabianca obtained good grades at the lyc√©e Napol√©on, then studied law at the University of Paris. In 1820 he became a member of the bar of Bastia, in Corsica, and practiced as a lawyer until 1848. Since he was a Bonapartist, the government of King Louis Philippe I kept him away from public office. Representative and Minister After the February Revolution, on 23 April 1848 de Casabianca was elected to the constituent assembly as representative of Corsica. He joined the majority and generally voted with the right. After the presidential election of 10 December 1848 he became one of the most zealous supporters of the President, Prince Louis Napoleon. He was reelected on 13 May 1849 as representative of Corsica in the legislative assembly. He continued to support the president, while joining the monarchist majority in votes. However, he abandoned the majority when conflict broke out with Louis Napoleon. On 26 October 1851 de Casabianca joined the cabinet as Minister of Agriculture and Commerce after the retirement of L√©on Faucher. In the new cabinet General de Saint-Arnaud became minister of war. After a few weeks he became Minister of Finance, where he was at the time of the coup of 2 December 1851. When told by Louis-Napoleon of the planned coup the day before it took place, he refused on principle to participate and was temporarily relieved of office. On 22 January 1852 Casabianca was charged with organizing the new Ministry of State. He left office on 28 July 1852 and entered the senate, where he voted for the establishment of the Second French Empire, and continued to vote with the majority. Later years By a decree of 5 March 1864 de Casabianca was named Attorney General at the Court of Accounts. During the Franco-Prussian War (19 July 1870 ‚Äì 10 May 1871), on 4 September 1870 he returned to private life. He briefly returned to politics when he was elected on 14 May 1876 as deputy for the Bastia district. He sat on the right with the Appel au peuple party. He did not stand in the 1877 elections. Joseph de Casabianca was named a Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour in 1858. He died in Paris on 24 May 1881.

Directed and produced by brothers Alan and Gabriel Polsky, the screenplay was adapted by Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue from Willy Vlautin's novel of the same name. The film was shot in Gardnerville, Minden, Reno, and Virginia City and also features animated sequences drawn by Mike Smith. Plot In 1990, Frank and Jerry Lee Flannigan, brothers who drift aimlessly, attempt to escape their hopeless lives through their creativity and excessive drinking. When Jerry Lee strikes and kills a child in a hit-and-run accident, the two immediately pack up their belongings and leave town. However, Jerry Lee abandons his brother at a diner, destroys the car, and steals his sometime girlfriend Polly's pistol. Jerry Lee loses his nerve before he can commit suicide and instead shoots himself in the leg, which was already amputated at knee. Subsequent flashbacks reveal that the boys' mother died when they were young, and, with their father missing, the two set off on their own; Jerry Lee's leg is injured when they attempt to stow away on a train. When Polly alerts Frank that Jerry Lee is in the hospital, he rushes to be with his brother. Although Frank attempts to reassure Jerry Lee that the boy was an unloved drifter like them, Jerry Lee remains dubious and guilt-ridden. When the police begin to piece together clues, the brothers once again decide to flee town, though Jerry Lee's leg has become infected. Frank meets with his friends, who suggest he invest his meager savings in the Tyson vs Douglas boxing match. Flush with cash after Douglas' upset victory, Frank donates some of his winnings to the dead boy's family and purchases a car from childhood father figure Earl Hurley, who advises him not to think of himself as a loser. Frank sneaks his brother out of the hospital just as the police arrive. Jerry Lee is excited to find that Frank has rescued an abused dog, and the three of them head to a small town. Although Frank professes there to be no reason to head there, he later reveals that his former girlfriend, Annie James, lives there. She has sent him postcards asking for forgiveness for an unspecified action. When Jerry Lee presses Frank to discuss his thoughts and feelings, Frank explains that he caught Annie's forced prostitution by her abusive mother. Encouraged by Jerry Lee, Annie and Frank slowly rekindle their relationship. Meanwhile, Jerry Lee sinks further into depression, claiming that no woman will love a man with one leg, especially after he has killed a child. Frank's alcoholism and apparent ulcers begin to worry Jerry Lee. At the same time, Jerry Lee's infected leg begins to grow worse. Unable to take care of himself, Jerry Lee is forced to request aid from Frank when he takes a shower and urinates. The brothers bond further over their hardships, but Frank remains cautiously noncommittal about his relationship with Annie. As Jerry Lee becomes more ill, he states that Frank's stories often feature tragic endings, especially for the women. When Jerry Lee is once again hospitalized, Frank recounts a new story with a happy ending, but before he can finish it, Jerry Lee dies from the infection. In the film's final scene, Frank meets Annie at her workplace, and he commits to her.

Reception Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator, reports that 70% of 43 surveyed critics gave the film a positive review; the average rating is 6.19/10. The general consensus states: \\"The Motel Life transcends its frustratingly uneven screenplay with some outstanding work from a talented cast.\\" Metacritic rated it 61/100 based on 19 reviews. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone wrote, \\"Striking. Tinged with humor and heartbreak. Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff are outstanding, engaged and enthralling.\\" Sheila O'Malley of RogerEbert.com wrote, \\"A beautifully warm film with a very kind heart. Every frame feels right, every choice feels thought-out, considered. All adds up to a heartbreaking whole. Stephen Dorff's performance is a damn near masterpiece of pathos.\\" Andy Webster of The New York Times wrote, \\"The story may be slight, but the performances and ambience resonate.\\" Jessica Kiang of Indiewire wrote, \\"But while it doesn't reinvent the wheel, or revolutionize the genre, it achieves its modest ambitions affectingly well, in no small part due to a clutch of cherishable performances, especially from leads Emile Hirsch and Stephen Dorff\\". Roman Vasyanov's cinematography was praised by The New York Daily News and The Wall Street Journal, who called him \\"a shooter to keep our eyes on\\". Drew Hunt of Slant Magazine wrote that \\"the film flatlines at a messy pace because of the frequent shifts in time and space\\". Boyd van Hoeij of Variety described it as \\"a film so full of explanatory flashbacks and animated sequences visualizing its characters' invented yarns that their real dramas are almost obscured.\\" Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian wrote, \\"Alan and Gabe Polsky's film about two hobo brothers on the run labours with heroes who are neither sympathetic or interesting\\". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that of the protagonists that \\"you'd have to be a very, very nice person to care about how it all works out for them.\\" =Awards= In 2012, The Motel Life received three awards out of four nominations at the Rome Film Festival. Hughes Winborne and Fabienne Rawley won Associazione Italiana Montaggio Cinematografico e Televisivo (AMC) Award, Gabe and Alan Polsky won the Audience Award and Noah Harpster and Micah Fitzerman-Blue won Best Screenplay.

Werner Herzog hosted a special screening of the film at The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences and expressed his admiration for the Polskys' directorial debut, stating, \\"It's really an accomplishment of two young filmmakers...You see a portion of America you have never seen in movies.\\" Kristofferson said that The Motel Life is the finest film he has ever been in.

Carpenter came with his family from Massachusetts and settled near the Fox River. Carpenter built the settlement's first store, bridge, and factory. He served two consecutive terms in the Illinois House of Representatives. Biography Julius Angelo Carpenter was born on August 19, 1827, in Uxbridge, Massachusetts, to Daniel G. Carpenter. Daniel and his brother Charles V. intended to settle in the Rock River Valley on their voyage east from Massachusetts. However, they were unable to cross the Fox River. Angelo, his father, and uncle then became the first settlers of what was originally known as Carpenters' Grove. Angelo Carpenter became the first settler of what would become Carpentersville, Illinois. He opened the first store there when he was 23 and, at his own expense, built the first bridge in the vicinity across the Fox River in 1851. Carpenter platted the settlement and, in commemoration, locals renamed the town Carpentersville. Carpenter was appointed postmaster and Supervisor of the village. In 1852, he married Mary Edwards. They had three children: Ella Elizabeth, Alice May, and Julius Angelo, Jr., who died as an infant. In 1864, Carpenter founded the Illinois Iron & Bolt Company in a former reaper factory. The new factory produced springs, clothes irons, and other metal accessories. Carpenter successfully ran for a seat in the Illinois House of Representatives in 1871. Carpenter moved to Elgin at the end of his second and final term in 1875. After expanding the company's operations by purchasing the nearby Star Manufacturing Company in 1873, Carpenter was able to persuade the Chicago and North Western Railroad to build a station in Carpentersville. Carpenter used his own funds to build an iron bridge to accommodate the new track. By 1912, when the two factories consolidates, they employed 2,000 people. In Elgin, he served as treasurer for the Northern Illinois Hospital and Asylum for the Insane and President of the Elgin City Banking Co. Carpenter owned of land in Kane County and in Champaign County. He died after a short illness on March 30, 1880, and was buried in Bluff City Cemetery in Elgin. His widow Mary dedicated Library Hall in Carpentersville in his memory.

The development of infrastructure networks is closely related to demographic, social and economic pre-existing environment. Bakis dismissed the unfounded hopes of positive spatial effects. Bakis wrote that despite the development of infrastructure and communications services \\"space continues to be differentiated and this is one of the reasons why networks are heterogeneous\\".Quoted by Milton Santos (1997),La nature de l'espace. Technique et temps, raison et √©motion, p. 189 He pleads also for the development of electro-sensitive fog free areas (implementation of the precautionary principle).Bakis H.

Today, it includes new attributes making it more complex. The cyberspace of electronic communication does not substitute nor overlap classical space; instead, it comes to mingle closely with the later at all scales. Bakis termed geocyberspace this contemporary form of geographic space in which are modified: the distance (apparent reduction), time (ubiquitous for some services) and costs.H.

In general, Berlusconism could be reassumed as a mix of liberal conservatism,Berlusconi: ¬´voglio fare la rivoluzione liberale¬ª, e noi ancora ci crediamo... populism,Berlusconi, Italy's original populist, fades from popularity liberism,[L'Italia di Berlusconi, Indro Montanelli, page 40, 41] anti-communismBerlusconi vuole fermare i comunisti: 'I miei, i governi migliori della storia' and atlanticism.Clinton: \\"Berlusconi, il miglior amico\\" Origins and features The term \\"Berlusconism\\" emerged in the 1980s, characterised by a strongly positive connotation as synonym of the \\"entrepreneurial optimism\\" of the time, defined as an entrepreneurial spirit which is not discouraged by difficulties, with a confidence in being able to solve problems.Floriano De Angeli, \\"L'Europeo\\", n. 49, 1993 However, starting in the 21st century and in consequence of the increasing identification of Berlusconi as a primarily political figure, the attributed meaning changed in the context of journalistic and political language. According to the Italian definition given by the online vocabulary of the Encyclopedia Institute, Berlusconism has a wide range of meanings, all having their origins in the figure of Berlusconi and the political movement inspired by him: the substantive refers not only to the \\"thought movement\\", but also to the \\"social phenomenon\\" and even the phenomenon \\"of custom\\" bound to his entrepreneurial and political figure. The term Berlusconism is also used to refer to a certain laissez-faire vision supported by him, not only of the economy and the markets, but also with reference to the same policy.¬´berlusconismo¬ª s. m., lemma del Vocabolario Treccani online, dal sito dell'Istituto dell'Enciclopedia italiana Treccani According to his political opponents and business rivals, Berlusconism is only a form of demagogic populism, comparable to fascism, stressing the fact that Berlusconi has declared his admiration for Benito Mussolini, even though he has criticised the racial Fascist laws and the alliance with Nazi Germany, referring to himself as pro-Israel. In 2013, he returned to calling Mussolini a good leader whose biggest mistake was signing up to exterminate the Jews. His supporters instead compare Berlusconism to the French Gaullism and the Argentine Peronism. Political positions Berlusconi during a Forza Italia rally Berlusconi defines himself and by extension Berlusconism as moderate,Berlusconi: \\"Dialogo? Io sono il pi√π moderato di tutti!\\", Affaritaliani, 11 febbraio 2009 liberal and pro-free trade (liberismo), but he is often accused of being a populist and a conservative.De Mita:\\"Berlusconi populista e antieuropeista come Grillo\\" ¬ª IRPINIANEWS.IT http://www.falcodestro.it/blog/2011/03/06/per-fini-berlusconi- e-un-conservatore%E2%80%A6-intanto-viene-fischiato-alla-commemorazione-di- almirante/ After his resignation in 2011, Berlusconi has become increasingly Eurosceptical and he is often critical of German Chancellor Angela Merkel. A feature of Berlusconi's leadership tactics is to use the party as a mean to gain power (with the party described as a \\"light party\\" because of its lack of a complex internal structure). This is decidedly comparable to the political tactics used by Charles De Gaulle in France. Another feature of great importance is the emphasis on a \\"liberal revolution\\", publicised and summarised by the \\"Contract with the Italians\\" of 2001. A strong reformism is added to these pillars, principally of the form of the Italian state and the constitution\\" in favour of moving from a parliamentary system to a semi- presidential system, a higher election threshold, the abolition of the Senate, the halving in size of the Chamber of Deputies, the abolition of the provinces and the reform of the judiciary, with separation of the careers between magistrates and magistrates's civil responsibility, from Berlusconi considered impartial. Berlusconi has declared himself to be persecuted by the judiciary, having undergone 34 processes, accusing them of being manipulated by the political left and comparing himself to Enzo Tortora as a victim of a miscarriage of justice. More recently, Berlusconi has declared himself in favour of civil unions. Comparisons to other leaders President George W. Bush A number of writers and political commentators consider Berlusconi's political success a precedent for the 2016 election of real estate tycoon Donald Trump as the 45th President of the United States, with most noting Berlusconi's panned Prime Minister tenure and therefore making the comparison in dismay. Roger Cohen of The New York Times argued: \\"Widely ridiculed, endlessly written about, long unscathed by his evident misogyny and diverse legal travails, Berlusconi proved a Teflon politician. [...] Nobody who knows Berlusconi and has watched the rise and rise of Donald Trump can fail to be struck by the parallels\\". In The Daily Beast, Barbie Latza Nadeau wrote: \\"If Americans are wondering just what a Trump presidency would look like, they only need to look at the traumatized remains of Italy after Berlusconi had his way\\".

Jack Laxer (1927-2018) was an American photographer best known for his work in stereoscopy. His photographs of California modern architecture have been published in magazines and books, displayed in museums, and included in educational programs since the 1950s. He photographed the homes of Lucille Ball and Harold Lloyd with the Stereo Realist camera. His clients included the architects Paul Revere Williams, William F. Cody, Arthur Froehlich, Ladd & Kelsey, and Armet & Davis, best known for their Googie coffee shops. Beginning in 1951 he documented the designs of Louis Armet and Eldon Davis including Norms, Pann‚Äôs, and the Holiday Bowl. These images were included in Alan Hess‚Äôs book Googie: Fifties Coffee Shop Architecture, setting off a revival of interest in the style beginning in the 1980s. The Los Angeles Conservancy Modern Committee exhibited Laxer‚Äôs photography in 1993 in an exhibition about the work of Armet & Davis at the Union Oil Center. In 2001 the group projected them in 3-D at the California Science Center. In 2009 DKRM Gallery in Los Angeles exhibited his work in the solo show Ultra-Angeles: Kodachrome in 3-D. Laxer taught a course at the Getty Museum in 2010 called Modernism in 3-D: The Art of Stereo Photography. The Chinese American Museum exhibited his 3D work in specially built viewers as part of their 2012 exhibit Breaking Ground: Chinese American Architects in Los Angeles. The Getty Museum included Laxer‚Äôs work (the only stereo photos) in the exhibit and publication Overdrive: L.A. Constructs The Future, which ran as part of the museum‚Äôs Pacific Standard Time series before relocating to the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. in October 2013.

It was first published in 1994 by Philomel Books. The story is about two boy soldiers who meet each other in the battlefield during the American Civil War. One of the protagonists, Sheldon Russell Curtis (\\"Say\\"), is a white soldier who was injured while trying to escape battle. He is saved by a former slave named Pinkus Aylee (\\"Pink\\"), who is now a soldier of the 48th Regiment Infantry U.S. Colored Troops. Pink carries him back to his Georgia home where he and his family were slaves. While the frightened soldier is nursed back to health under the care of Pink‚Äôs mother, Moe Moe Bay, he begins to understand why his newfound friend is so adamant on returning to the war; to fight against the sickness that is slavery.  Plot  The story begins during the times of the Civil War. Sheldon Russell Curtis or \\"Say\\", a white Union Soldier is badly wounded on the battlefield. He tries to escape with an injured leg, but cannot due to the pain. Lying on the ground, he sees an African American Yankee soldier named Pinkus Aylee or \\"Pink\\" coming to his rescue. Sheldon is very hesitant at first, as Pink was an African American; one of the people that he was warned about. Pink gives Say some water for what little nourishment he can offer. Carefully, Pink carries Say back to his home in Georgia, where he lives with his mother, Moe Moe Bay. There, Pink and his mother restore Say back to full health. This act of great kindness brings Say to be friends with Pink and his mother as they spend long days with each other, enjoying the peace they have. Later, a group of \\"Marauders\\" Confederate soldiers came to search Pink‚Äôs home. Only barely foreseeing the coming raid, Moe Moe Bay tells Pink and Say to hide in the root cellar, out of the sight of the soldiers. The soldiers shot and killed Moe Moe Bay in an attempt to distract them from the boys. Pink and Say eventually came out of the cellar and found Moe Moe Bay's dead body lying on the ground. They decide to bury her, then Pink and Say decide to try to find their troops. On the way back to their camp some Confederates found them and took them to their camp as prisoners. The two prisoners of war receive vastly different treatment: Say is released from captivity some months later, while Pink was hanged within hours. At the end of the story, Polacco lets the reader know that Sheldon Curtis was her great-great-grandfather, and that the story of Pink and Say was an oral tradition in her family; she wrote the book to serve \\"as a written memory of Pinkus Aylee\\", Polacco's great-great-grandfathers hero. Reception Pink and Say was well received by literary critics. Anita Silvey said in 2012 that she still cries every time she reads it. \\"In forty-eight pages Patricia Polacco brings children into the loss and heartache of the Civil War.\\" It has also been called \\"probably the most powerful picture book written about the Civil War\\". Pink and Say has been used by educators to engage with students in dialogue about topics such as race relations and man's inhumanity to man, and to teach them about the Civil War.

A former mayor of Livingston, New Jersey, he served as a senior official in the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey during the administration of New Jersey Governor Chris Christie until 2013, when Wildstein resigned in the midst of a scandal involving traffic lanes closures. On May 1, 2015 he pleaded guilty to two federal felony counts of conspiracy as part of a plea agreement. Wildstein was sentenced in July 2017 without incarceration. He was sentenced to three years' probation and 500 hours of community service. He was also fined $10,000 and prohibited from seeking or accepting employment with any government agency. Early life and early political career Wildstein grew up in a Jewish familyNew Jersey Jewish News: \\"Jewish figures on all sides of ‚ÄòBridgegate‚Äô - Christie friends, foes include a schoolmate, attorney, and mayor\\" by Robert Wiener, January 29, 2014 in Livingston. He attended Livingston High School in the late 1970s, where he was a classmate (one year ahead) of future governor Chris Christie. Christie has said that although he knew who Wildstein was and that both of them had worked on Thomas Kean's campaign for governor in 1977, Christie and Wildstein were not close acquaintances in high school: \\"We didn't travel in the same circles in high school. You know, I was the class president and athlete. I don't know what David was doing during that period of time.\\" Christie and Wildstein were both members of the school's baseball team; Christie was a catcher, Wildstein was the team's statistician. In an interview published in 2014, the team's coach recalled that Wildstein was \\"a very quiet, unassuming, brilliant kid\\" with \\"a brilliant mind for numbers and figures\\" although not a skilled player. Wildstein's lifelong involvement with politics began early. At age 12, he was mentioned by a local newspaper as having left a group backing one congressional candidate in order to throw his support behind the candidate's opponent, Thomas Kean Sr., then a member of the state Assembly and a neighbor of Wildstein. (Kean, a Republican, would later become governor of New Jersey, serving from 1982 to 1990.) At 16, Wildstein filed a lawsuit in a failed attempt to get on the ballot as a member of the county Republican Committee. The following year, he ran in the local school board election, although he was legally too young to have served on the school board. Still a high school student at the time, Wildstein was accused by his social studies teacher of having deceptively encouraged his teacher to sign a letter of support that was published in the local newspaper. They later issued a joint statement describing the episode as a misunderstanding. After graduating high school, Wildstein attended college in Washington, D.C., working on a presidential campaign and as a political consultant while a student. He served as executive director of the New Jersey Legislature‚Äôs Legislative Caucus on Israel to deal with Jewish-related foreign policy, according to a 1983 JTA report. Over the course of his political career, he worked for a number of other New Jersey Republican politicians, including two congressmen, Chris Smith and Bob Franks. At 23, he was elected to a four-year term on the town council, serving from 1985 to 1988. He then served as mayor of Livingston from 1987 to 1988. Some considered his personal style in local politics at the time aggressive and combative, and he alienated even some members of his own party. He was very outspoken on some issues, including his opposition to low-income housing in Livingston, which he said was wasting the county government's money. After placing poorly in a primary election, he vowed to stay out of local politics in the future. He began working as a top executive in the family's Georgia-based textile manufacturing business, Apache Mills, one of the country's largest floor mat manufacturers. Wildstein worked at the company from 1988 to 2007. PolitickerNJ.com and \\"Wally Edge\\" blog In 2000, while still working at the family business, Wildstein secretly founded a New Jersey political news site called PoliticsNJ.com (since renamed PolitickerNJ.com), which he ran with the financial support of his friend New Jersey real estate mogul Jared Kushner, who publishes the New York Observer. Wildstein wrote a blog on New Jersey politics for the site using the pseudonym \\"Wally Edge\\", after the former New Jersey Republican governor and US senator Walter Edge. The site published news, political commentary, and rumors based on anonymous tips from government officials and political operatives. Wildstein's true identity as the blog's author was only revealed in 2010 when he was appointed by the Christie administration to work at Port Authority. Several journalists credit Wildstein with having helped launch their careers while they worked at PolitickerNJ.com, including Politico reporter Alex Isenstadt; James Pindell, the political director at WMUR in New Hampshire; Political and sports cartoonist Rob Tornoe; and Steve Kornacki, who hosts a cable television political news commentary program on MSNBC. Kornacki has said of Wildstein, \\"I've never met anybody ... with more thorough institutional knowledge of New Jersey politics.\\" Port Authority tenure The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey is a congressionally-authorized joint venture between the states of New Jersey and New York which manages much of the regional transportation infrastructure, including bridges, tunnels, airports, and seaports. Senior staff at the agency are appointed by the governors of the two states. In 2010, Wildstein was appointed by newly installed Governor Chris Christie's senior representative at the Port Authority, Bill Baroni, to serve as the agency's Director of Interstate Capital Projects, making Wildstein the second highest- ranking Christie political appointee among the agency's executives, after Baroni himself. This position had never existed at the Port Authority prior to Wildstein's appointment and had no job description, but drew an annual salary of $150,020. The Record's Shawn Boburg, who wrote a March 2012 profile about Wildstein based on interviews with then-current and past Port Authority colleagues, described Wildstein as the governor's \\"eyes and ears\\" at the agency, watching the entire agency, as one informant put it, for \\"strict adherence to the Christie agenda\\". Boburg has said Wildstein \\"made a point to stay in the shadows and be the person directing the show from behind the curtains\\" and \\"was known for walking the halls, monitoring other executives.\\" Wildstein \\"was wildly feared and admired for his work ethic, his intelligence, and his political savvy.\\" Fort Lee bridge lane closure scandal The George Washington Bridge, which connects the city of Fort Lee, New Jersey with New York City and is one of the busiest bridges in the world, is managed by the Port Authority. From September 9 through September 13, 2013, two of the three lanes providing local access to a Fort Lee entrance to the bridge were closed on Wildstein's orders without notification of local government officials, emergency responders, or other Port Authority officials, resulting in massive traffic congestion and delays for the community of Fort Lee. Some local officials and political commentators speculated that Wildstein and associates in the Christie administration had ordered the lane closures as political retribution against the Democratic mayor of Fort Lee, or other members of the Democratic Party who represent Fort Lee. In early December 2013, just days before the state legislature was scheduled to begin hearings to investigate the lane closures, Wildstein announced his resignation, saying he had planned to leave the agency the following year but \\"the Fort Lee issue has been a distraction, and I think it's better to move on earlier.\\" Under subpoena from the legislature ordering him to produce documents related to the lane closures, Wildstein turned over emails and text messages that showed Christie administration aides discussing the lane closures. In an eight-word email, Christie's deputy chief of staff, Bridget Anne Kelly, wrote to Wildstein in August 2013, \\"Time for some traffic problems in Fort Lee.\\"Emails Between Top Christie Aides and Port Authority Officials, New York Times (January 8, 2014). Wildstein replied \\"Got it\\" one minute later.Timeline of events around GWB lane-closure controversy, The Record (January 8, 2014). When New York appointees at the Port Authority, who had not been notified that the lanes would be closed, reopened the lanes, Wildstein told Kelly that the Port Authority's chair, also an appointee of Christie, was \\"helping us to retaliate.\\" In an email exchange about fallout over the lane closures between Wildstein and Christie's campaign chief and closest political confidante, Bill Stepien, Wildstein wrote, \\"It will be a tough November for this little Serbian,\\" apparently referring to Fort Lee's Democratic mayor, Mark Sokolich (who is actually of Croatian, not Serbian, ancestry). Called to testify before a state Assembly committee investigating the lanes closure in January 2014, Wildstein invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and refused to answer the committee members' questions. The committee found him in contempt and referred the case for prosecution. Wildstein's attorney Alan Zegas said that Wildstein would answer any questions if granted immunity from prosecution. On January 31, 2014, a letter from counsel for Wildstein alleged that, in contrast to Christie's public assertions, the governor knew of the lane closures while they were happening in September 2013 and suggested that Wildstein had documents to prove his claims. Guilty plea and cooperation with federal prosecutors Wildstein pleaded guilty in federal district court in Newark, New Jersey to two felony counts of conspiracy--one count of conspiracy to misapply property of the Port Authority and one count of conspiracy to violate the civil rights of Fort Lee residents in the September 2013 lane closings--as part of a plea agreement with federal prosecutors.David Wildstein‚Äôs Plea Agreement in Bridge Lane-Closing Scandal, New York Times.Christie ally David Wildstein pleads guilty, says Bridgegate closures were retribution, NJ.com (May 1, 2015). The plea agreement was signed on January 12, 2015, and publicly released on May 1, 2015, when Wildstein formally entered his guilty plea in court before Judge Susan D. Wigenton. Wildstein's attorney confirmed that he had been cooperating with federal investigators for some months. On the same day, William E. \\"Bill\\" Baroni (then the deputy executive directory of the Port Authority) and Bridget Anne Kelly (then deputy chief of staff to Governor Chris Christie) were indicted on nine counts each in connection with the scandal.Updates on George Washington Bridge Scandal, New York Times (May 1, 2015). Kelly denied any responsibility for the Bridgegate scandal--saying \\"I am not guilty for the crimes for which I've been accused\\"--and said: \\"David Wildstein is a liar.\\" In the plea hearing, Wildstein admitted that he had conspired with Baroni and Kelly to shut down the lanes and cause significant traffic problems in retribution for Sokolich's decision not to endorse Christie for reelection. In return for his cooperation with federal prosecutors, Wildstein was released pending sentencing on a $100,000 personal recognizance bond. Wildstein could be sentenced to 21 to 27 months in federal prison. Sentencing of Wildstein was originally scheduled for August 2015, but it was delayed until January 2016--after the trials of Baroni and Kelly, who have pleaded not guilty and were set to be tried in November 2015.Shawn Boburg, GWB probe: Sentencing for David Wildstein delayed until January, The Record (August 6, 2015). In January 2016, sentencing was delayed again. The trial finally began on September 19, 2016. Baroni and Kelly were convicted on all counts on November 14, 2016, and later sentenced to 2 years in prison (Baroni) and 18 months (Kelly), with both maintaining their innocence and stating their intention to appeal. As part of the plea agreement, Wildstein testified against Baroni and Kelly at their trial, becoming a \\"key witness\\" in the proceeding. According to the Bergen County Record, \\"Federal prosecutors routinely postpone sentencing of government cooperators who have pleaded guilty until after the trial for which they are a potential witness so that the extent of their cooperation may be considered by the judge\\" at their own sentencing. In opening arguments in the trial federal prosecutors said that Wildstein would testify that Christie and Baroni were aware of the plan as the closures were taking place. On June 5, 2017, Wildstein's sentencing was rescheduled for July 12, 2017 where he received probation. The New Jersey Globe In 2018, Wildstein founded a New Jersey political reporting site called The New Jersey Globe, supported by Jared Kushner-ally Ken Kurson.https://newjerseyglobe.com/about-us/ See also *Governorship of Chris Christie *List of people involved in the Fort Lee lane closure scandal NotesReferences Category:Living people Category:Livingston High School (New Jersey) alumni Category:People from Livingston, New Jersey Category:Mayors of places in New Jersey Category:American political consultants Category:American bloggers Category:Jewish American writers Category:American political writers Category:American male non-fiction writers Category:Port Authority of New York and New Jersey people Category:New Jersey politicians convicted of crimes Category:New Jersey Republicans Category:1961 births Category:21st-century American non-fiction writers Category:American male bloggers ","title":"David Wildstein"},{"id":"41597226","text":"Sarah Maria Wilson (died 1786) was an English actress.

According to a barely credible account of Lee Lewes, he married in the country, as a seventh husband, a Mrs. Grace, who is said to have been the original Jenny in the 'Provoked Husband.' She was, in fact, Myrtilla, Mrs. Cibber playing Jenny. She must have been fifty years of age, and Wilson little over twenty. Wilson then married, it is said, a daughter of Charles Lee Lewes, and afterwards, it is to be presumed, Mrs. Weston.

The game was released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment on 8 April 2014 in North America, and 11 April in Europe. The game is a follow-up to Lego The Lord of the Rings based on the first two Hobbit films; An Unexpected Journey and The Desolation of Smaug. It was released on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, PlayStation Vita, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, Nintendo 3DS, OS X and Microsoft Windows. On 1 January 2019, all digital sales of the game were halted. This was confirmed a few days later by publisher Warner Bros. Interactive. The game was later re-added to Steam on 27 April 2020 and on PSN Store on 6 May 2020  Gameplay  The game shows several features from the previous games, including a feature where the user should locate specific materials to build a big Lego object. When the user selects and input the correct materials a screen is displayed where the Lego machine is built and the player should select the correct pieces in exchange for studs. Also the characters have different actions to perform, making the Dwarf Company a group with different capabilities during the mission, including someone with archery abilities, another that uses a big hammer that can move big objects, another with the ability to extract minerals from stones, and so on. Bilbo improves his abilities as the game advances: when he gains Sting he has the ability to be a more skilled fighter; and when he gets the One Ring he can disappear and build invisible Lego structures. The game, similar to the latest Lego video games, is composed on a big map, rather than a single hub. The player can move among different events where different characters ask the player to retain a specific material from a mission or to exchange materials.  Plot  Much like its predecessors, the game presents storylines from The Hobbit films: An Unexpected Journey and Desolation of Smaug. However, the developers modified the storylines to fit the events into a number of game chapters per film, as well as adding the humour the series has become known for.  DLC  There are 3 DLC included with this game. They are The Big Little Character Pack, Side Quest Character Pack and The Battle Pack.  Cancelled The Battle of the Five Armies DLC  It was reported at the London Toy Fair in January 2014 that a DLC would be released covering the events of the final film in The Hobbit series, to be released around the time of the film at the end of that year. However, no DLC was released. Over a year later, in a correspondence with GameSpot it was revealed that, despite no actual cancellation of the DLC, there were no longer any plans to adapt the film as a DLC, nor to adapt it as another game.  Audio  Similar to Lego The Lord of the Rings, Lego The Hobbit features talking minifigures. The dialogue is taken directly from the films. Additional voices were provided by Tim Bentinck, Liz May Brice, Clare Corbett, Duncan Duff, Daniel Fine, Joel Fry, Jenny Galloway, Andy Gathergood, Anna Koval, Jonathan Kydd, Steve Kynman, Jamie Lee, Andy Linden, Sara Beck Mather, James Naylor, Emma Pierson, Jason Pitt, Richard Ridings, Emma Tate, and Marcia Warren.

She is foremost known for being the central figure in one of the famous incidents referred to as the Maiden Abduction from Vreta, where she, like her mother before her, was abducted from Vreta Abbey by the man she later married. Later in life, she became an abbess at the very same abbey, in which position she served in 1323‚Äì1344. Ingrid was the daughter of Svantepolk of Viby and Benedicta of Bjelbo and thereby niece of Queen Catherine of Sweden. She was engaged to the Danish noble David Torstensson, but placed in the Vreta Abbey as a child to be educated prior to marriage; her sister Catherine was also placed there, but in her case to join the order. In 1287, Ingrid was abducted by the Norwegian jarl Folke Algotsson, which became the third of the famous Maiden Abductions from Vreta, the two previous having been the abductions of her mother and maternal grandmother. Folke took her to Norway, where they married. Ingrid returned to Sweden after Folkes death in 1310. Before March 1322, she became a member of the Vreta Abbey, and in 1323, she succeeded her sister as its abbess. She abdicated in 1344, and is last mentioned in 1350, when she temporarily served as abbess between the death of the former abbess and before the election of the next.

It is the seat for the Eparchy of Saint Nicholas of Chicago. History In the late 1890s immigrants from western and Carpathian Ukraine begin to arrive on Chicago's north side. Planning for the establishment of St. Nicholas Parish began in 1905 by a small group of Ukrainian laborers. The parish was established the following year on January 28. By then they had raised enough money to buy their first church from a Danish Protestant congregation at Bishop and Superior streets. The property at Oakley Boulevard and Rice Street was purchased in 1913 and the present church was completed in 1915. Property on Higgins Road was purchased for a cemetery in 1925 for $10,000.00. The parish school was built in 1936. As more immigrants settled in the neighborhood after World War II and the congregation grew, the school was expanded in 1954. The Eparchy of Saint Nicholas of Chicago was established on July 14, 1961 and St. Nicholas was elevated as the cathedral. From 1974 to 1977 the cathedral's interior was renovated by iconographer Boris Makarenko. The Liturgy is celebrated in both Ukrainian and English. Architecture The church was designed by the Chicago architectural firm of Worthmann & Steinbach. It was modeled after Saint Sophia's Cathedral in Kiev. There is an image of St. Sophia's Cathedral in the fresco above the main altar. The exterior features thirteen domes that represent Christ and the Twelve Apostles. A mosaic of Our Lady of Pochaiv is located above the main entrance and above her is the icon of the cathedral patron, St. Nicholas. The interior is covered in icons that are rendered in both mosaics and frescos. The icons are patterned after those found in St. Sophia in Kiev. They depict the life of Christ, his Mother Mary and many saints. The only icon that was not touched in the 1974-1977 renovation was one that depicts Christ with his apostles and his Mother in the rear of the sanctuary. It dates from 1928. A chandelier, made in Greece, is suspended from the main dome. It is made of gold and features nine tiers that are lit with 480 lights. Images of the 12 apostles encircle the exterior. It is thought to be the largest chandelier of its kind in the United States. The stained glass windows in the church were designed by the Munich Studio of Chicago.

He was the first uniformed BPD officer to rise through the ranks to become commissioner. Early life Jordan was born in South Boston. He was the second youngest of six children. As a child, Jordan wanted to be a police officer. Early career In 1946, Jordan joined the Boston Police Department as a traffic patrol officer. In 1950 he became a detective. During the 1950s and 60s he was a member of \\"Slattery's Raiders\\", a group of officers under the command of Captain John J. Slattery, Jr. that was formed to combat vice and street crime in Boston. In 1967 Jordan was chosen to command the department's narcotics unit. Two years later he was promoted to Deputy Superintendent and Chief of Detectives. In 1973 he was placed in command of Area C, which consisted of the Allston, Brighton, Back Bay, and the South End. On July 17, 1974, Jordan was promoted to Superintendent and placed in charge of the Bureau of Field Services. He was later named Superintendent-in-Chief, the second highest position in the BPD after Commissioner. While serving as a police officer, Jordan took courses at Northeastern University as a way to study to promotion exams. He spent sixteen years as a student at Northeastern and earned his bachelor's degree in 1969. He later completed a master's program in public administration. Commissioner On October 5, 1976, Mayor Kevin White announced that Jordan would succeed Robert diGrazia as Commissioner when diGrazia's retirement became effective on November 15. The announcement was considered surprising because White chose to make Jordan's appointment permanent and not conduct a nationwide search. White said that he chose to make the permanent appointment because he wanted to prevent speculation that would put the progress the department made during diGrazia's tenure in jeopardy. Jordan's appointment made him the first career officer to become permanent commissioner. During his tenure as Commissioner, Jordan was criticized by the BDP's two labor unions, who believed that his changes in procedure were a collective bargaining matter. In 1984, Jordan and his top commanders were sued by the Superior Officers Federation over working conditions. He was also criticized by Clergy and Citizens for Justice, a Roxbury-based group that believed Jordan and members of his department were insensitive to the people of color in the community and guilty of brutality. Jordan denied the allegations of police brutality and dismissed the group as \\"ultra-liberals\\" who \\"[had] to criticize because that's their lifestyle\\". He pointed to the fact that the number of minority uniformed officers increased from 5 to 15 percent during his tenure as proof that he was not insensitive to minorities. In 1983, the Massachusetts Civil Service Commission charged Jordan and White with using Proposition 2 1/2 \\"as a cover\\" to lay off 284 patrolmen in 1981. Jordan disputed the accusation, stating that because his budget needed to be cut by $20 million and 90% of the department's budget was in personnel, the layoffs were necessary. After he was elected mayor in 1983, Raymond Flynn expressed his desire to name his own Commissioner and asked Jordan to step down, a request which Jordan refused. However, on January 15, 1985, Jordan announced that he was retiring effective January 31. The announcement came after negotiations with the mayor's aides resulted in an agreement in which Jordan would return for one day to the rank of superintendent, which, as a uniformed officer, would entitle Jordan to a buy- back of accrued sick leave and unused vacation time. After his retirement from the BDP, Jordan became an associate at Cass Associates, a Boston security consulting and investigating firm that developed security and drug programs for hospitals and technology companies.

It is located near Transport Nagar, Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India. Established in 1977, the institution is one of the leading day-boarding schools in Agra. It has international accreditation through the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examination. It is the home of the Franciscan Capuchin priests whose duty it is to manage and administer the school. It holds the ICSE exams for Class X and the ISC exams for Class XII. ISC Certificate examination is on par with overseas schools which means students passing out of this institution will no longer be required to obtain 'A' level qualification or complete bridging courses while seeking admission in the universities of UK, Australia and other countries. It is managed by a religious body called Order of Friars Minor Capuchin, through a registered body Capuchin Friars Minor Education Society, Uttar Pradesh. The motto of the institution is \\"Truth, Love, Service\\".http://conrads.in/genesis.asp  History  Fr. Aloysius Fernandes Capuchin bought a five-acre plot of land from Mr. Ninuaram and Mr. Kishanlal; another stretch of land from a Muslim, Mr. Hasamuddin and Navabuddin, in 1968. The original plan in purchasing this land was to house the retired and ailing Franciscan Capuchins working in the Archdiocese of Agra. In 1969 Fr.Hugh, Capuchin, began constructing a boundary wall on all four sides and barbed wire above. It was supervised by Bro.Ruben Furtado. Soon Fr. Hugh constructed a room for the watchman and in case a member wanted to stay there. In the same year Bro.Ruben had a tube well bored in the existing open well. From 1971 to 1973 he cultivated the fields, daily coming to the plot from St. Mary's Church, Ajmer Road, Agra. In 1973 Fr. Vincent Lobo succeeded Fr.Hugh. During this time there was a great possibility of not being able to realize the said purpose since the Nagar Mahapalika of Agra had served notice for acquisition of the land to execute their master plan. In view of this Fr. Vincent thought it best to build a prayer hall (church) for which permission had been granted to Fr. Hugh earlier. Fr. Vincent brought Br. Osmund Dias to this place to supervise the construction work. The foundation for the ashram and prayer hall was laid by the Most. Rev. Dr. Dominic Athaide, Capuchin, the late Archbishop of Agra, on September 8, 1973. The construction took more than a year to complete. When Fr. John Joseph, was chosen to be in charge of Agra-Lucknow Mission, he began to stay in the residence here instead of St. Fidelis Ashram, Lucknow, which had been the headquarters of the mission. He came to stay here on December 26, 1974. Then onwards fathers and brothers began to come to Ashram at regular intervals. In 1975 it got an exemption from the Development Authority, Lucknow, on the condition that we open a school in the premises for the people of the locality. In 1975 we decided to open an English-Medium School. The foundation stone was blessed by the late Archbishop, Dr. Dominic Athaide, Capuchin, and laid by Mr.A.N.Sehgal, Administrator of Nagar Mahapalika, Agra, on April 13, 1978. St. Conrad's School was established on July 1, 1978, in the green and pollution-free environment to cater to the needs of the local population. The school went in for co-education. To begin with, there were only 9 students on the roll. In the beginning, there was only one teacher, Mrs. A. Sebastian. It was not in the present building then but in the present chapel which is in the residential block now. 1978 marked the beginning of the construction of the ground floor; the first floor was completed in 1984. All this was possible because of the great master builder, Bro. Julian Crasto and Bro. Oliver, the executor. Fr. John Lewis took over in 1981 and Fr. Richard Mathias was the vice-principal. The school looked with hope and confidence to the future. The school got its affiliation to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, New Delhi, on May 29, 1983. The very first batch of students who appeared for the ICSE examinations in March 1985, secured a cent per cent result. St.Conrad's Inter College is a private, recognized and non-aided Christian minority institution founded in the year 1978. It is affiliated to the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, New Delhi and will prepare the students for the ICSE Certificate Examination (Class X) and the ISC Certificate Examination (Class XII). St.Conrad's Inter College has the international accreditation through ISC Board. ISC Certificate examination (XII level of ICSE Board, New Delhi) is on par with overseas school leaving certificate which means students passing out of this institution will no longer be required to obtain 'A' level qualification or complete bridging courses while seeking admission in the universities of UK, Scotland, Australia and other commonwealth countries.  Patron Saint  St. Conrad, whose original name was John, was born in 1818 A.D. at Parzham in Bavaria, Germany. From an early age, he showed a love of a solitary life, and was a devoted Christian. At the age of 31, John joined the Franciscan Capuchins where he was given the name Conrad. He became the porter at the Capuchin Monastery at Alt√∂tting, a post he kept for the rest of his life. He died in April 1894. After Conrad's death, several miracles were ascribed to him, and in 1934 he was declared a saint by the Catholic Church.  Principals  *Rev. Fr. John Joseph (1977‚Äì1980) *Rev.

The daughter of Ellen Ripley (protagonist of the film series), an elderly Amanda is first introduced in the extended version of Aliens. Amanda is also the protagonist of the 2014 video game Alien: Isolation, which is set prior to Aliens. Conception and creation A deleted scene from the 1986 theatrical version of Aliens, reinserted into the Special Edition first released in 1992, reveals that Ellen Ripley (played by Sigourney Weaver) has a daughter, Amanda. Amanda was 10-years-old when Ellen travels into space before the events of Alien. Amanda became an adult, married (taking on the surname McClaren), and died during her mother's 57-year stasis between the events of the first two films. A picture of Amanda as an elderly adult is shown to Ripley. The picture is one of Weaver's real-life mother, Elizabeth Inglis. The scene was cut from the film due to 20th Century Fox's concerns about the film's length. Weaver was furious at the removal, considering it to be crucial to Ellen Ripley's character development in the film, taking on a protective mother role to the young character Rebecca \\"Newt\\" Jorden. In James Cameron's 1983 Alien II film treatment for what would become Aliens, Amanda (then unnamed) was alive, but old and crippled. When her mother contacted her from the Gateway Station, Amanda blames her mom for her absence.Alien II original treatment by James Cameron For the video game Alien: Isolation, most early development was done with a female test dummy, with it being \\"almost just an assumption\\" that the lead would be a female character. The game chose to focus on Amanda. The developers wanted Amanda to echo some of her mother's traits, while being her own distinct character. Examples given of how she mirrored Ellen Ripley included her determination, while also initially being colder than Ellen. Isolation utilised performance-capture acting in an attempt to bring believability to its characters. Fictional biography Amanda was conceived during a layover between haulage trips. Though this contravened Weyland-Yutani (W-Y) policy, her mother was not disciplined and the pregnancy was allowed to come to term.Crew dossier seen in Aliens, available as bonus feature on Alien Anthology Blu-ray Amanda was delivered in a home birth, with her mother refusing anything for the pain, out of concern for years using cryo-drugs during trips in cryostasis. She was 10 years old when Ellen Ripley goes off into space aboard the Nostromo. According to the canonical novel Alien: Out of the Shadows, her father abandoned them, when Amanda was only 3 years old. According to the novelization of Aliens, Amanda's parents drifted apart and separated; with Ripley gaining custody. Before setting off on the Nostromo, and before the events of Alien, Ellen had promised Amanda that she would be back home in time for her 11th birthday. In Alien: Isolation, Amanda Ripley is an engineer for W-Y who is approached by its synthetic, Christopher Samuels. Samuels informed her that the flight recorder of the Nostromo had been discovered by the salvage ship Anesidora and taken to the Sevastopol Station, a supply depot in orbit around the gas giant KG348. Believing that it will provide her closure, Amanda accepts a place on the recovery team, travelling on the W-Y ship Torrens. According to Aliens, Amanda at some point married, taking on the surname McClaren, but had no children. She died on December 23, 2178 from cancer. Ripley was cremated and interred at Westlake Repository, Little Chute, Wisconsin. According to the non-canon novel, Alien: Original Sin, Ripley-8, in looking further into Amanda's life, learned that she had worked as a reporter. Reception The character's critical reception was mixed. Despite criticizing much of Isolation, Ryan McCaffrey from IGN stated that Amanda has a \\"clearly defined tough-as-nails personality befitting of her mother.\\" Danielle Riendeau of Polygon praised Amanda from a feminist perspective as a worthy successor to, as well as the best female protagonist since Ellen Ripley. Riendeau would later go on to call 2014 \\"the year women characters rule\\" for the number of prominent women in video games, further praising the game's ability to tie playing Amanda into its gameplay. Wireds Matt Peckham criticised the choice to have the player character as Ellen's daughter, calling it a \\"narrative cheat,\\" and found the ultimate pay-off \\"hurried and a little forced.\\" Peckham praised having a female player character though, and wrote: \\"It's wonderful playing as a strong, clever, self-reliant woman, and a testament to the game and character that I stopped caring Amanda was Ellen's daughter an hour or two in, but surely such traits extend beyond the Ripley gene pool.\\" Jeff Marchiafava from Game Informer criticised the character, feeling that she \\"exhibits little growth or personality.\\" Blake Peterson, writing for Game Revolution, felt the game failed to ever develop Amanda or connect the player to her emotionally, commenting that she \\"soon feels like a placeholder\\" for the more iconic Ellen Ripley.

It was produced in the 1980s in Lithuania. Design and development The Lithuanian LAK-16 primary glider was designed by Gintaras Sabaliauskas and Kƒôstutis Leonaviƒçius as a successor to the LAK-14 Strazdas. For its first flight, it was fitted with a LAK-14 wooden wing but on later examples the wood was replaced with more modern materials. The LAK-16 is a high braced wing monoplane, with a simple parallel chord. Its wing is unswept and fabric covered, with broadly curved tips; on early production models it had a glassfibre single spar, glassfibre leading edges and ribs. On the later LAK-16M the wing structure is metal and is strengthened as a result. There are lobate, fabric covered ailerons which project behind the trailing edges, mounted on inset hinges. The LAK-16 has a flat open frame fuselage based on a pair tubes, steel at the front and aluminium aft. The upper tube is straight from the tail to the leading edge, after which it curves down to form the nose of the glider, joining the lower tube. This is initially parallel to the upper rear tube but turns upwards aft from below the wing, so the fuselage depth decreases towards the tail. The fuselage is divided into three bays by vertical cross members and further stiffened with three diagonal members. The wing is mounted on the upper tube and braced with a single strut on each side from about one third span to the lower tube. Bracing wires from the wing at the top of the struts run rearwards to the tail and forward to the nose to limit in-plane flexing of the fuselage. The tail, built around duralumin tube structures and fabric covered, is conventional with a straight tapered tailplane on top of the fuselage. Its separate elevators have a gap between them for rudder movement. The vertical tail is swept, with a rounded top; the rudder is broad and reaches down to the keel. The single GRP seat and headrest is mounted on the lower beam, with the pilot entitirely exposed, apart from the screening provided by a small nose fairing. The LAK-16 lands on a pair of small wheels mounted on self-sprung, cantilever GRP legs, assisted by a self-centering tailwheel. Transportation and storage is simplified by the mounting of the wing, which with bracing and aileron wires disconnected can be rotated through 90¬∞. Operational history The LAK-16, with its wooden wing, first flew on 6 September 1986 and production probably began in 1987. Production numbers are not known, though serial numbers suggest they may have reached several hundred. In 2010, seventeen remained on the Lithuanian civil register with another in Poland.

He was sworn in as deputy governor after the impeachment of the former deputy governor Sir Jude Agbaso by the Imo House of Assembly. He also survived series of failed impeachment plots sponsored by his estranged friend and political associate, Owelle Rochas Okorocha. Early life and education Madumere was born in Port Harcourt, Rivers State with family roots in Mbaitoli, Imo State, Nigeria. He is the third among seven children of his parents HRH Eze Henry Anoruo Madumere and Ugoeze Malinda Madumere. He attended Primary and Secondary Education in, Owerri and Lagos state respectively after which he travelled to the United States of America where he studied Management in San Jacinto College, Houston, Texas, and later on University of Houston and Texas Southern University to study business management and played American college football as outside linebacker for the University of Houston . He is a holder of master's degree in History and International Studies from Imo State University, while currently pursuing his Doctorate Degree in History and International Studies also in Imo State University, Owerri, Imo State. Business career As a man of Calibre, Madumere worked as Area Manager of Channel Development in KFC and PepsiCo Inc in the United States for thirteen years, in order to explore the variety of flavors in the world. As an American trained Management guru, he has brought his expertise to bear in both private and public sector. Prince Madumere worked with PepsiCo Inc. in the United States of America as an Area Manager, Channels Development Department where he traveled to over fifty countries expanding the business scope of the Multinational firm. He is a fellow of Nigeria Institute of Management, fellow of Nigeria Institute of Strategic Management and, fellow of Nigeria Institute of Administrators and also a fellow of African Business School. As an entrepreneur, he has successfully managed businesses in Aviation, General Trading and also owned a chain of men beauty centers. As Management and Administrative consultant, Madumere is a fellow to the following professional bodies: - Nigerian Institute of Management(NIM), Institute of Strategic Management, Nigeria, African Business School, Corporate Institute of Administrators, Nigeria etcetera. Political career During the 1998 gubernatorial elections in Nigeria, Madumere went back to Nigeria and served as director for Women and Youth Mobilization for Owelle Rochas Okorocha's campaign in Imo State under the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). He also served as chief strategist on media and logistics for Okorocha's presidential bid under the ANPP in 2002‚Äì2003. He once worked in the presidency as the chief of staff to the presidential adviser on inter-party relations. In December 3, 2005, he ran for the Senate seat in Imo East Senatorial District (Owerri Zone) after it was declared vacant following the death of Senator Amah Iwuagwu. After the 2011 election, where Okorocha emerged victorious as the Governor of Imo State, Prince Ezeakonobi Madumere (MFR) was appointed the chief of staff to the Governor of Imo State, where he exhibited obstinate drive for excellence. He became deputy governor on 30 March 2013. Prince Eze Madumere, leader of All Progressives Congress raising candidate's hand during a rally On the eve of 2011 Governorship election, Prince Eze Madumere's doggedness, fearlessness and obstinacy to defend Nigeria's Democracy was appreciably underscored, when was confined to an unjust detention for about a week at the Imo State Police Command Headquarters, Owerri for refusing to betray his boss and releasing whatever strategic information of the Rescue Mission Campaign Organization. As if that was not enough, a kangaroo legal process was speedily initiated based on unfounded and laughable allegation that he led a group of undisclosed persons to throw sachet water at the convoy of former President Olusegun Obasanjo and the then Governor of Imo state, Chief Ikedi Ohakim. Thereafter, Prince Ezeakonobi was whisked to Owerri Prisons on awaiting trial for about a month at the time the Imo Rescue Mission was holding the grand finale rally in Owerri. It took the efforts of the Nigerian Civil Societies, their international counterparts and the Media to secure his release. It was appreciation of this sacrifice, to ensure that people's will was not scuttled, that the then President of Nigeria, Dr. Goodluck Jonathan was honoured with one of the highest National Honours Award, Member of the order of the Federal Republic (MFR). (ref: 'I have forgiven those who put me in jail on NAIJA247 NEWS By Babatunde Akinsola - Jul 17, 2014, ). As the Deputy Governor of Imo State, his accomplishments are numerous especially in the area of Security, dispute and crisis management and resolution. His historic resolutions of disputes between host communities and oil exploration firms in the oil communities of Imo State are legendary. He has left a lasting legacy of harmonious relationship between the communities and their business guests. Among some of the cases were Orsu Obodo community vs Addax Oil, Walter Smith Oil Exploration Vs Awarra Community, oil spillage crises between AGIP and Ohaji Egbema local government youths. He also brokered peace between Irete Community and Nigeria bottling company limited. Statutorily, as the Chairman of Imo State Boundary Commission, his knack for excellence in all facets of human endeavour also played out as he liaised with the former Deputy Governor of Abia State to nip in the bud what would have been a bloody skirmish bet seen Ihitte-Uboma and a community in Abia State. With an understanding between him and his Anambra State Deputy Governor colleague, effort is being made to resolve all boundary issues between Imo State and Anambra State as the affected communities have complied to conduct themselves in a peaceful manner. (ref; Nation: \\"Time to unveil Madumere February 11, 2018 in Politics). Also see the Nigerian Voice www.thenigerianvoice.com - Agip Oil Spillage: Imo government wades into Ohaji Egbema...) Prince Ezeakonobi Madumere at present is handling majorly world Bank and International agencies in relation to development of the core sectors of Imo State. For his avowed resolve to always stand by the people, in 2018, he disagreed with Governor Okorocha over irreconcilable issues that bordered on draconian policies that were both alien and inhuman in the history of governance. After much appeal for Okorocha to rescind his unpopular decisions, on February 25, 2018, he respectfully confronted his estranged boss on the salient issues and as they affected the people of the state. One of the critical issues on the front burner was Okorocha's affront to foist his son-in-law, Uche Nwosu, as he successor, which heated up the polity. Madumere fearlessly told his estranged boss he would not be party to what he described as their term through the back door. Madumere, for the first time, made public his stand on vexatious matters among which were demolition of business premises without first providing alternative, and where alternative markets were provided, it was freely shared to family members, friends and extended family members, leaving the poor to suffer and finding it difficult to feed. He also frowned at the poor quality jobs in the area of Road rehabilitation and construction as no known construction company was engaged, thereby giving room for the collapse of the roads during every rainy season. Madumere also described the recklessness in administering the state where civil servants were totally bundled out of their statutory functions, giving room for large scale corruption and financial impropriety. For these and more, Okorocha in connivance and collusion of the leadership of Imo lawmakers sponsored Madumere's impeachment with tax payers fund with the deputy speaker, Hon. Ugonna Ozuruigbo ingloriously moving a motion for the removal of Madumere from Office as the Deputy Governor of Imo State. See Punch, July 10, 2018(ref: I'm not an ex-convict, Madumere replies Imo lawmakers); (Punch, August 5, 2018: \\"Okorocha hired lawmakers to remove deputy ‚Äì Ex- Justice commissioner), After six failed attempts to remove Madumere from Office following the difficulty in finding any impeachable offence against him, on phoney claims, there was a seventh attempt, where Imo House of Assembly led by Acho Ihim purportedly claimed it removed Madumere from Office despite a subsisting Court Order by Imo High Court presided by Hon. Justice Ben. Iheka. Finally, on September 25, 2018, the court also presided by Iheka nullified the purported impeachment of Madumere as the Deputy Governor of Imo State, declaring it null and void and of no effect.

Community Work/Charity Prince Eze Madumere, a good family man who is happily married with children, is a member of Red Cross Society for many years. He has served as a two term chairman of the society in Imo State Branch where he contributed immensely as one of the financiers. He also donated two Ambulances to the Society. His avowed commitment to helping the wounded and victims of natural disaster, disputes and accidents is never in doubt. He was personally involved in the rescue operation during the flood incidents in the riverine areas of the state in 2015 and 2018 respectively. He has also led a team of Red Cross members at various occasions to rescue accident victims where they were evacuated to the government owned hospitals for treatment. Again, in the area of community development, Madumere has consistently maintained an annual football competition for over 25 years in his mid twenties to engender unity and peace among the youths. This effort has led to the establishment of a football academy where talented youngsters are recruited for proper grooming and development. He is the first individual in Imo State of Nigeria to have hosted an Athletic championship in field and track events. He was also a backbone of Heartland FC of Owerri, Imo State where he invested time and money to save the club severally from relegation and at one time led them to victory. His periodic visits to hospitals to look out for those who may not have money to pay for their treatments have also been applauded by the people. His periodic peace missions to communities that are having skirmishes have paid off as he has nipped in the bud what ordinarily would cause disputes of high magnitude.

Biography  In 1982 Pearson enrolled in Queen's University with the intention of becoming a doctor like both of his parents. To earn money on the side, he ran his own small businesses, painting houses and the like, and subsequently developed an interest in entrepreneurialism. The new business interest ultimately prompted Pearson to change his major. He graduated from Queen's in 1986 with a BScH in life sciences ‚Äì later returning to earn his MBA in marketing. Pearson currently resides in Toronto and is married to his wife of 28 years, Sally, with three children, Jeremy, Robyn and Hayley.  Career  Pearson began his career as a product manager for Quaker Oats in 1988. He then served as a channel marketing manager at Alias before joining current company LoyaltyOne in 1992. Pearson started his 20-year tenure with the company as a director of sponsor marketing at AIR MILES, Canada's largest coalition loyalty program. He then worked as vice president of sponsor management for the program before eventually becoming AIR MILES president. In this role, Pearson oversaw the development and execution of loyalty and database marketing strategies that build long-term, interactive and value-added relationships with AIR MILES customers. Today, Pearson is unemployed. He previously served as the CEO and president of LoyaltyOne and also functioned as the president of Alliance Data Loyalty Services. He is a highly regarded expert on enterprise loyalty, retail marketing, coalition marketing and customer relationship management and has been quoted in more than 150 news outlets including The Wall Street Journal, Forbes, BusinessWeek, the Los Angeles Times, MSNBC and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Pearson is also a regular contributor to COLLOQUY, a loyalty marketing publication owned by LoyaltyOne, at which he also serves on the editorial board. He is also a regular columnist for Fast Company.  Books  Pearson is the author of the bestselling book The Loyalty Leap: Turning Customer Information into Customer Intimacy as well as The Loyalty Leap for B2B. The Loyalty Leap landed on best-seller lists in the first week of its release. It ranked at No. 5, No. 3 and No. 10 on the New York Times, USA Today and Wall Street Journal non-fiction best-seller lists, respectively. The book reveals common myths behind the privacy debate and challenges critics who equate data-usage marketing with for-profit spying. It also touches upon the concept of enterprise loyalty and the role front-line employees play in creating relevant offers for customers. Finally, the book shares five principles for using customer data responsibly while being sensitive to privacy concerns - ultimately enabling companies to make the loyalty leap. The Loyalty Leap for B2B was written as a followup to The Loyalty Leap and was published exclusively as an e-book. Pearson's second book provides the steps to making the loyalty leap in a B2B relationship across three different segments: small businesses, large enterprises and channel marketers. It offers a blueprint for using customer information to support a business's specific goals and features case studies from American Express, Teradata, Premier Healthcare Exchange and Salesforce.com. In addition, the e-book details six steps to creating a loyalty initiative that will enhance business relationships and improve revenue and productivity.

In probability, statistics and related fields, a Poisson point process is a type of random mathematical object that consists of points randomly located on a mathematical space. The Poisson point process is often called simply the Poisson process, but it is also called a Poisson random measure, Poisson random point field or Poisson point field. This point process has convenient mathematical properties, which has led to it being frequently defined in Euclidean space and used as a mathematical model for seemingly random processes in numerous disciplines such as astronomy,G.

The process is named after French mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson despite Poisson never having studied the process. Its name derives from the fact that if a collection of random points in some space forms a Poisson process, then the number of points in a region of finite size is a random variable with a Poisson distribution. The process was discovered independently and repeatedly in several settings, including experiments on radioactive decay, telephone call arrivals and insurance mathematics. The Poisson point process is often defined on the real line, where it can be considered as a stochastic process. In this setting, it is used, for example, in queueing theory to model random events, such as the arrival of customers at a store, phone calls at an exchange or occurrence of earthquakes, distributed in time. In the plane, the point process, also known as a spatial Poisson process, can represent the locations of scattered objects such as transmitters in a wireless network,J. G. Andrews, R. K. Ganti, M.

Meester and R. Roy. Continuum percolation, volume 119 of cambridge tracts in mathematics, 1996. The Poisson point process can be defined on more abstract spaces. Beyond applications, the Poisson point process is an object of mathematical study in its own right. In all settings, the Poisson point process has the property that each point is stochastically independent to all the other points in the process, which is why it is sometimes called a purely or completely random process. Despite its wide use as a stochastic model of phenomena representable as points, the inherent nature of the process implies that it does not adequately describe phenomena where there is sufficiently strong interaction between the points. This has inspired the proposal of other point processes, some of which are constructed with the Poisson point process, that seek to capture such interaction. The point process depends on a single mathematical object, which, depending on the context, may be a constant, a locally integrable function or, in more general settings, a Radon measure. In the first case, the constant, known as the rate or intensity, is the average density of the points in the Poisson process located in some region of space. The resulting point process is called a homogeneous or stationary Poisson point process. In the second case, the point process is called an inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson point process, and the average density of points depend on the location of the underlying space of the Poisson point process. The word point is often omitted, but there are other Poisson processes of objects, which, instead of points, consist of more complicated mathematical objects such as lines and polygons, and such processes can be based on the Poisson point process. Overview of definitions Depending on the setting, the process has several equivalent definitions as well as definitions of varying generality owing to its many applications and characterizations. The Poisson point process can be defined, studied and used in one dimension, for example, on the real line, where it can be interpreted as a counting process or part of a queueing model; in higher dimensions such as the plane where it plays a role in stochastic geometry and spatial statistics;A. Baddeley. A crash course in stochastic geometry. Stochastic Geometry: Likelihood and Computation Eds OE Barndorff-Nielsen, WS Kendall, HNN van Lieshout (London: Chapman and Hall), pages 1‚Äì35, 1999. or on more general mathematical spaces. Consequently, the notation, terminology and level of mathematical rigour used to define and study the Poisson point process and points processes in general vary according to the context. Despite all this, the Poisson point process has two key properties‚Äîthe Poisson property and the independence property‚Äî that play an essential role in all settings where the Poisson point process is used. The two properties are not logically independent; indeed, independence implies the Poisson distribution of point counts, but not the converse. =Poisson distribution of point counts= A Poisson point process is characterized via the Poisson distribution. The Poisson distribution is the probability distribution of a random variable \\\\textstyle N (called a Poisson random variable) such that the probability that \\\\textstyle N equals \\\\textstyle n is given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\Lambda} where \\\\textstyle n! denotes \\\\textstyle n factorial and the parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda determines the shape of the distribution. (In fact, \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda equals the expected value of \\\\textstyle N.) By definition, a Poisson point process has the property that the number of points in a bounded region of the process's underlying space is a Poisson-distributed random variable. =Complete independence= Consider a collection of disjoint and bounded subregions of the underlying space. By definition, the number of points of a Poisson point process in each bounded subregion will be completely independent of all the others. This property is known under several names such as complete randomness, complete independence, or independent scattering and is common to all Poisson point processes. In other words, there is a lack of interaction between different regions and the points in general,W. Feller. Introduction to probability theory and its applications, vol. ii pod. 1974. which motivates the Poisson process being sometimes called a purely or completely random process. Homogeneous Poisson point process If a Poisson point process has a parameter of the form \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda= u \\\\lambda, where \\\\textstyle u is Lebesgue measure (that is, it assigns length, area, or volume to sets) and \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda is a constant, then the point process is called a homogeneous or stationary Poisson point process. The parameter, called rate or intensity, is related to the expected (or average) number of Poisson points existing in some bounded region, where rate is usually used when the underlying space has one dimension. The parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda can be interpreted as the average number of points per some unit of extent such as length, area, volume, or time, depending on the underlying mathematical space, and it is also called the mean density or mean rate; see Terminology. =Interpreted as a counting process= The homogeneous Poisson point process, when considered on the positive half-line, can be defined as a counting process, a type of stochastic process, which can be denoted as \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{N(t), t\\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\}. A counting process represents the total number of occurrences or events that have happened up to and including time \\\\textstyle t. A counting process is a homogeneous Poisson counting process with rate \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0 if it has the following three properties: * N(0)=0; * has independent increments; and * the number of events (or points) in any interval of length t is a Poisson random variable with parameter (or mean) \\\\lambda t. The last property implies: : \\\\mathbb{E}[N(t)]=\\\\lambda t. In other words, the probability of the random variable N(t) being equal to n is given by: : \\\\mathbb{P}\\\\\\\\{N(t)=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{(\\\\lambda t)^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\lambda t}. The Poisson counting process can also be defined by stating that the time differences between events of the counting process are exponential variables with mean \\\\textstyle 1/\\\\lambda. The time differences between the events or arrivals are known as interarrival or interoccurence times. =Interpreted as a point process on the real line= Interpreted as a point process, a Poisson point process can be defined on the real line by considering the number of points of the process in the interval \\\\textstyle (a,b]. For the homogeneous Poisson point process on the real line with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0, the probability of this random number of points, written here as \\\\textstyle N(a,b], being equal to some counting number \\\\textstyle n is given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N(a,b]=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{[\\\\lambda(b-a)]^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\lambda (b-a)}, For some positive integer \\\\textstyle k, the homogeneous Poisson point process has the finite-dimensional distribution given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N(a_i,b_i]=n_i, i=1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{[\\\\lambda(b_i-a_i)]^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\\\\lambda(b_i-a_i)}, where the real numbers \\\\textstyle a_i. In other words, \\\\textstyle N(a,b] is a Poisson random variable with mean \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(b-a), where \\\\textstyle a\\\\le b. Furthermore, the number of points in any two disjoint intervals, say, \\\\textstyle (a_1,b_1] and \\\\textstyle (a_2,b_2] are independent of each other, and this extends to any finite number of disjoint intervals. In the queueing theory context, one can consider a point existing (in an interval) as an event, but this is different to the word event in the probability theory sense. It follows that \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda is the expected number of arrivals that occur per unit of time. Key properties The previous definition has two important features shared by Poisson point processes in general: * the number of arrivals in each finite interval has a Poisson distribution; * the number of arrivals in disjoint intervals are independent random variables. Furthermore, it has a third feature related to just the homogeneous Poisson point process: * the Poisson distribution of the number of arrivals in each interval \\\\textstyle(a+t,b+t] only depends on the interval's length \\\\textstyle b-a. In other words, for any finite \\\\textstyle t>0, the random variable \\\\textstyle N(a+t,b+t] is independent of \\\\textstyle t, so it is also called a stationary Poisson process. Law of large numbers The quantity \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(b_i-a_i) can be interpreted as the expected or average number of points occurring in the interval \\\\textstyle (a_i,b_i], namely: : E\\\\\\\\{N(a_i,b_i] \\\\\\\\}=\\\\lambda(b_i-a_i), where \\\\textstyle E denotes the expectation operator. In other words, the parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda of the Poisson process coincides with the density of points. Furthermore, the homogeneous Poisson point process adheres to its own form of the (strong) law of large numbers. More specifically, with probability one: : \\\\lim_{t\\\\rightarrow \\\\infty} \\\\frac{N(t)}{t} =\\\\lambda, where \\\\textstyle \\\\lim denotes the limit of a function, and \\\\lambda is expected number of arrivals occurred per unit of time. Memoryless property The distance between two consecutive points of a point process on the real line will be an exponential random variable with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda (or equivalently, mean \\\\textstyle 1/\\\\lambda). This implies that the points have the memoryless property: the existence of one point existing in a finite interval does not affect the probability (distribution) of other points existing, but this property has no natural equivalence when the Poisson process is defined on a space with higher dimensions. Orderliness and simplicity A point process with stationary increments is sometimes said to be orderly or regular if: : P\\\\\\\\{N(t,t+\\\\delta]>1\\\\\\\\}= o(\\\\delta), where little-o notation is being used. A point process is called a simple point process when the probability of any of its two points coinciding in the same position, on the underlying space, is zero. For point processes in general on the real line, the property of orderliness implies that the process is simple, which is the case for the homogeneous Poisson point process. Martingale characterization On the real line, the homogeneous Poisson point process has a connection to the theory of martingales via the following characterization: a point process is the homogeneous Poisson point process if and only if : N(-\\\\infty,t]-t, is a martingale.E. Merzbach and D. Nualart. A characterization of the spatial poisson process and changing time. The Annals of Probability, 14(4):1380‚Äì1390, 1986. Relationship to other processes On the real line, the Poisson process is a type of continuous-time Markov process known as a birth process, a special case of the birth‚Äìdeath process (with just births and zero deaths).A. Papoulis and S. U. Pillai. Probability, random variables, and stochastic processes. Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2002. More complicated processes with the Markov property, such as Markov arrival processes, have been defined where the Poisson process is a special case. Restricted to the half-line If the homogeneous Poisson process is considered just on the half-line \\\\textstyle [0,\\\\infty), which can be the case when \\\\textstyle t represents time then the resulting process is not truly invariant under translation. In that case the Poisson process is no longer stationary, according to some definitions of stationarity. Applications There have been many applications of the homogeneous Poisson process on the real line in an attempt to model seemingly random and independent events occurring. It has a fundamental role in queueing theory, which is the probability field of developing suitable stochastic models to represent the random arrival and departure of certain phenomena. For example, customers arriving and being served or phone calls arriving at a phone exchange can be both studied with techniques from queueing theory. Generalizations The homogeneous Poisson process on the real line is considered one of the simplest stochastic processes for counting random numbers of points.D. Snyder and M. Miller. Random point processes in time and space 2e springer-verlag. New York, NY, 1991. This process can be generalized in a number of ways. One possible generalization is to extend the distribution of interarrival times from the exponential distribution to other distributions, which introduces the stochastic process known as a renewal process. Another generalization is to define the Poisson point process on higher dimensional spaces such as the plane. =Spatial Poisson point process= A spatial Poisson process is a Poisson point process defined in the plane \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^2. For its mathematical definition, one first considers a bounded, open or closed (or more precisely, Borel measurable) region \\\\textstyle B of the plane. The number of points of a point process \\\\textstyle N existing in this region \\\\textstyle B\\\\subset \\\\textbf{R}^2 is a random variable, denoted by \\\\textstyle N(B). If the points belong to a homogeneous Poisson process with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0, then the probability of \\\\textstyle n points existing in \\\\textstyle B is given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N(B)=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{(\\\\lambdaB)^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\lambdaB} where \\\\textstyle B denotes the area of \\\\textstyle B. For some finite integer \\\\textstyle k\\\\geq 1, we can give the finite-dimensional distribution of the homogeneous Poisson point process by first considering a collection of disjoint, bounded Borel (measurable) sets \\\\textstyle B_1,\\\\dots,B_k. The number of points of the point process \\\\textstyle N existing in \\\\textstyle B_i can be written as \\\\textstyle N(B_i). Then the homogeneous Poisson point process with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0 has the finite-dimensional distribution: : P\\\\\\\\{N(B_i)=n_i, i=1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{(\\\\lambdaB_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\\\\lambdaB_i}. Applications According to one statistical study, the positions of cellular or mobile phone base stations in the Australian city Sydney, pictured above, resemble a realization of a homogeneous Poisson point process, while in many other cities around the world they do not and other point processes are required. The spatial Poisson point process features prominently in spatial statistics, stochastic geometry, and continuum percolation theory. This point process is applied in various physical sciences such as a model developed for alpha particles being detected. In recent years, it has been frequently used to model seemingly disordered spatial configurations of certain wireless communication networks. For example, models for cellular or mobile phone networks have been developed where it is assumed the phone network transmitters, known as base stations, are positioned according to a homogeneous Poisson point process. =Defined in higher dimensions= The previous homogeneous Poisson point process immediately extends to higher dimensions by replacing the notion of area with (high dimensional) volume. For some bounded region \\\\textstyle B of Euclidean space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, if the points form a homogeneous Poisson process with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0, then the probability of \\\\textstyle n points existing in \\\\textstyle B\\\\subset \\\\textbf{R}^d is given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N(B)=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{(\\\\lambdaB)^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\lambdaB} where \\\\textstyle B now denotes the \\\\textstyle d-dimensional volume of \\\\textstyle B. Furthermore, for a collection of disjoint, bounded Borel sets \\\\textstyle B_1,\\\\dots,B_k \\\\subset \\\\textbf{R}^d, let \\\\textstyle N(B_i) denote the number of points of \\\\textstyle N existing in \\\\textstyle B_i. Then the corresponding homogeneous Poisson point process with parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0 has the finite- dimensional distribution: : P\\\\\\\\{N(B_i)=n_i, i=1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{(\\\\lambdaB_i)^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\\\\lambdaB_i}. Homogeneous Poisson point processes do not depend on the position of the underlying space through its parameter \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda, which implies it is both a stationary process (invariant to translation) and an isotropic (invariant to rotation) stochastic process. Similarly to the one-dimensional case, the homogeneous point process is restricted to some bounded subset of \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, then depending on some definitions of stationarity, the process is no longer stationary. =Points are uniformly distributed= If the homogeneous point process is defined on the real line as a mathematical model for occurrences of some phenomenon, then it has the characteristic that the positions of these occurrences or events on the real line (often interpreted as time) will be uniformly distributed. More specifically, if an event occurs (according to this process) in an interval \\\\textstyle (a,b] where \\\\textstyle a \\\\leq b, then its location will be a uniform random variable defined on that interval. Furthermore, the homogeneous point process is sometimes called the uniform Poisson point process (see Terminology). This uniformity property extends to higher dimensions in the Cartesian coordinate, but not in, for example, polar coordinates. Inhomogeneous Poisson point process Graph of an inhomogeneous Poisson point process on the real line. The events are marked with black crosses, the time-dependent rate \\\\lambda(t) is given by the function marked red. The inhomogeneous or nonhomogeneous Poisson point process (see Terminology) is a Poisson point process with a Poisson parameter set as some location-dependent function in the underlying space on which the Poisson process is defined. For Euclidean space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, this is achieved by introducing a locally integrable positive function \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x), where \\\\textstyle x is a \\\\textstyle d-dimensional point located in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, such that for any bounded region \\\\textstyle B the (\\\\textstyle d-dimensional) volume integral of \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda (x) over region \\\\textstyle B is finite. In other words, if this integral, denoted by \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda (B), is: : \\\\Lambda (B)=\\\\int_B \\\\lambda(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx < \\\\infty, where \\\\textstyle{\\\\mathrm dx} is a (\\\\textstyle d-dimensional) volume element, then for any collection of disjoint bounded Borel measurable sets \\\\textstyle B_1,\\\\dots,B_k, an inhomogeneous Poisson process with (intensity) function \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x) has the finite-dimensional distribution: : P\\\\\\\\{N(B_i)=n_i, i=1, \\\\dots, k\\\\\\\\}=\\\\prod_{i=1}^k\\\\frac{(\\\\Lambda(B_i))^{n_i}}{n_i!}e^{-\\\\Lambda(B_i)}. Furthermore, \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda (B) has the interpretation of being the expected number of points of the Poisson process located in the bounded region \\\\textstyle B, namely : \\\\Lambda (B)= E[N(B)] . =Defined on the real line= On the real line, the inhomogeneous or non-homogeneous Poisson point process has mean measure given by a one-dimensional integral. For two real numbers \\\\textstyle a and \\\\textstyle b, where \\\\textstyle a\\\\leq b, denote by \\\\textstyle N(a,b] the number points of an inhomogeneous Poisson process with intensity function \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(t) occurring in the interval \\\\textstyle (a,b]. The probability of \\\\textstyle n points existing in the above interval \\\\textstyle (a,b] is given by: : P\\\\\\\\{N(a,b]=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{[\\\\Lambda(a,b)]^n}{n!}e^{-\\\\Lambda(a,b)}. where the mean or intensity measure is: : \\\\Lambda(a,b)=\\\\int_a^b \\\\lambda (t)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dt, which means that the random variable \\\\textstyle N(a,b] is a Poisson random variable with mean \\\\textstyle E\\\\\\\\{N(a,b]\\\\\\\\} = \\\\Lambda(a,b). A feature of the one-dimension setting, is that an inhomogeneous Poisson process can be transformed into a homogeneous by a monotone transformation or mapping, which is achieved with the inverse of \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda . Counting process interpretation The inhomogeneous Poisson point process, when considered on the positive half-line, is also sometimes defined as a counting process. With this interpretation, the process, which is sometimes written as \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{N(t), t\\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\}, represents the total number of occurrences or events that have happened up to and including time \\\\textstyle t. A counting process is said to be an inhomogeneous Poisson counting process if it has the four properties: * \\\\textstyle N(0)=0; * has independent increments; * \\\\textstyle P\\\\\\\\{ N(t+h) - N(t)=1 \\\\\\\\} =\\\\lambda(t)h + o(h); and * \\\\textstyle P\\\\\\\\{ N(t+h) - N(t)\\\\ge 2 \\\\\\\\} = o(h), where \\\\textstyle o(h) is asymptotic or little-o notation for \\\\textstyle o(h)/h\\\\rightarrow 0 as \\\\textstyle h\\\\rightarrow 0. In the case of point processes with refractoriness (e.g., neural spike trains) a stronger version of property 4 applies: P(N(t+h)-N(t) \\\\ge 2) = o(h^2). The above properties imply that \\\\textstyle N(t+h) - N(t) is a Poisson random variable with the parameter (or mean) : E[N(t+h) - N(t)]=\\\\int_t^{t+h}\\\\lambda (s)\\\\,ds, which implies : E[N(h)]=\\\\int_0^h \\\\lambda (s) \\\\, ds. =Spatial Poisson process= An inhomogeneous Poisson process defined in the plane \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^2 is called a spatial Poisson process It is defined with intensity function and its intensity measure is obtained performing an surface integral of its intensity function over some region. For example, its intensity function (as a function of Cartesian coordinates x and \\\\textstyle y) can be : \\\\lambda(x,y)= e^{-(x^2+y^2)}, so the corresponding intensity measure is given by the surface integral : \\\\Lambda(B)= \\\\int_B e^{-(x^2+y^2)}\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx\\\\,\\\\mathrm dy, where \\\\textstyle B is some bounded region in the plane \\\\mathbb{R}^2. =In higher dimensions= In the plane, \\\\Lambda(B) corresponds to an surface integral while in \\\\mathbb{R}^d the integral becomes a ( d-dimensional) volume integral. =Applications= When the real line is interpreted as time, the inhomogeneous process is used in the fields of counting processes and in queueing theory. Examples of phenomena which have been represented by or appear as an inhomogeneous Poisson point process include: * Goals being scored in a soccer game.A. Heuer, C. Mueller, and O. Rubner. Soccer: Is scoring goals a predictable Poissonian process? EPL, 89(3):38007, 2010. * Defects in a circuit boardJ. Y. Hwang, W. Kuo, and C. Ha. Modeling of integrated circuit yield using a spatial nonhomogeneous poisson process. Semiconductor Manufacturing, IEEE Transactions on, 24(3):377‚Äì384, 2011. In the plane, the Poisson point process is important in the related disciplines of stochastic geometry and spatial statistics. The intensity measure of this point process is dependent on the location of underlying space, which means it can be used to model phenomena with a density that varies over some region. In other words, the phenomena can be represented as points that have a location-dependent density. This processes has been used in various disciplines and uses include the study of salmon and sea lice in the oceans,M. Krko{\\\\vs}ek, M. A. Lewis, and J. P. Volpe. Transmission dynamics of parasitic sea lice from farm to wild salmon. Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences, 272(1564):689‚Äì696, 2005. forestry, and search problems.P. A. Lewis and G. S. Shedler. Simulation of nonhomogeneous Poisson processes by thinning. Naval Research Logistics Quarterly, 26(3):403‚Äì413, 1979. =Interpretation of the intensity function= The Poisson intensity function \\\\lambda(x) has an interpretation, considered intuitive, with the volume element \\\\mathrm dx in the infinitesimal sense: \\\\lambda(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx is the infinitesimal probability of a point of a Poisson point process existing in a region of space with volume \\\\mathrm dx located at x. For example, given a homogeneous Poisson point process on the real line, the probability of finding a single point of the process in a small interval of width \\\\delta is approximately \\\\lambda \\\\delta x. In fact, such intuition is how the Poisson point process is sometimes introduced and its distribution derived. =Simple point process= If a Poisson point process has an intensity measure that is a locally finite and diffuse (or non-atomic), then it is a simple point process. For a simple point process, the probability of a point existing at a single point or location in the underlying (state) space is either zero or one. This implies that, with probability one, no two (or more) points of a Poisson point process coincide in location in the underlying space. Simulation Simulating a Poisson point process on a computer is usually done in a bounded region of space, known as a simulation window, and requires two steps: appropriately creating a random number of points and then suitably placing the points in a random manner. Both these two steps depend on the specific Poisson point process that is being simulated. =Step 1: Number of points= The number of points N in the window, denoted here by W, needs to be simulated, which is done by using a (pseudo)-random number generating function capable of simulating Poisson random variables. Homogeneous case For the homogeneous case with the constant \\\\lambda, the mean of the Poisson random variable N is set to \\\\lambda W where W is the length, area or ( d-dimensional) volume of W. Inhomogeneous case For the inhomogeneous case, \\\\lambda W is replaced with the ( d-dimensional) volume integral : \\\\Lambda(W)=\\\\int_W\\\\lambda(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx =Step 2: Positioning of points= The second stage requires randomly placing the \\\\textstyle N points in the window \\\\textstyle W. Homogeneous case For the homogeneous case in one dimension, all points are uniformly and independently placed in the window or interval \\\\textstyle W. For higher dimensions in a Cartesian coordinate system, each coordinate is uniformly and independently placed in the window \\\\textstyle W. If the window is not a subspace of Cartesian space (for example, inside a unit sphere or on the surface of a unit sphere), then the points will not be uniformly placed in \\\\textstyle W, and suitable change of coordinates (from Cartesian) are needed. Inhomogeneous case For the inhomogeneous, a couple of different methods can be used depending on the nature of the intensity function \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x). If the intensity function is sufficiently simple, then independent and random non-uniform (Cartesian or other) coordinates of the points can be generated. For example, simulating a Poisson point process on a circular window can be done for an isotropic intensity function (in polar coordinates \\\\textstyle r and \\\\textstyle \\\\theta), implying it is rotationally variant or independent of \\\\textstyle \\\\theta but dependent on \\\\textstyle r, by a change of variable in \\\\textstyle r if the intensity function is sufficiently simple. For more complicated intensity functions, one can use an acceptance-rejection method, which consists of using (or 'accepting') only certain random points and not using (or 'rejecting') the other points, based on the ratio: : \\\\frac{\\\\lambda(x_i)}{\\\\Lambda(W)}=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda(x_i)}{\\\\int_W\\\\lambda(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx. } where \\\\textstyle x_i is the point under consideration for acceptance or rejection. General Poisson point process The Poisson point process can be further generalized to what is sometimes known as the general Poisson point process or general Poisson process by using a Radon measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda, which is locally-finite measure. In general, this Radon measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda can be atomic, which means multiple points of the Poisson point process can exist in the same location of the underlying space. In this situation, the number of points at \\\\textstyle x is a Poisson random variable with mean \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda({x}). But sometimes the converse is assumed, so the Radon measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda is diffuse or non-atomic. A point process \\\\textstyle {N} is a general Poisson point process with intensity \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda if it has the two following properties: * the number of points in a bounded Borel set \\\\textstyle B is a Poisson random variable with mean \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda(B). In other words, denote the total number of points located in \\\\textstyle B by \\\\textstyle {N}(B), then the probability of random variable \\\\textstyle {N}(B) being equal to \\\\textstyle n is given by: : P \\\\\\\\{ {N}(B)=n\\\\\\\\}=\\\\frac{(\\\\Lambda(B))^{n}}{n!}e^{-\\\\Lambda(B)} * the number of points in \\\\textstyle n disjoint Borel sets forms \\\\textstyle n independent random variables. The Radon measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda maintains its previous interpretation of being the expected number of points of \\\\textstyle {N} located in the bounded region \\\\textstyle B, namely : \\\\Lambda (B)= E[{N}(B)] . Furthermore, if \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda is absolutely continuous such that it has a density (which is the Radon‚ÄìNikodym density or derivative) with respect to the Lebesgue measure, then for all Borel sets \\\\textstyle B it can be written as: : \\\\Lambda (B)=\\\\int_B \\\\lambda(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx, where the density \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x) is known, among other terms, as the intensity function. History=Poisson distribution= Despite its name, the Poisson point process was neither discovered nor studied by the French mathematician Sim√©on Denis Poisson; the name is cited as an example of Stigler's law. The name stems from its inherent relation to the Poisson distribution, derived by Poisson as a limiting case of the binomial distribution. This describes the probability of the sum of \\\\textstyle n Bernoulli trials with probability \\\\textstyle p, often likened to the number of heads (or tails) after \\\\textstyle n biased flips of a coin with the probability of a head (or tail) occurring being \\\\textstyle p. For some positive constant \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda>0, as \\\\textstyle n increases towards infinity and \\\\textstyle p decreases towards zero such that the product \\\\textstyle np=\\\\Lambda is fixed, the Poisson distribution more closely approximates that of the binomial. Poisson derived the Poisson distribution, published in 1841, by examining the binomial distribution in the limit of \\\\textstyle p (to zero) and \\\\textstyle n (to infinity). It only appears once in all of Poisson's work, and the result was not well known during his time. Over the following years a number of people used the distribution without citing Poisson, including Philipp Ludwig von Seidel and Ernst Abbe. At the end of the 19th century, Ladislaus Bortkiewicz would study the distribution again in a different setting (citing Poisson), using the distribution with real data to study the number of deaths from horse kicks in the Prussian army. =Discovery= There are a number of claims for early uses or discoveries of the Poisson point process. For example, John Michell in 1767, a decade before Poisson was born, was interested in the probability a star being within a certain region of another star under the assumption that the stars were \\"scattered by mere chance\\", and studied an example consisting of the six brightest stars in the Pleiades, without deriving the Poisson distribution. This work inspired Simon Newcomb to study the problem and to calculate the Poisson distribution as an approximation for the binomial distribution in 1860. At the beginning of the 20th century the Poisson process (in one dimension) would arise independently in different situations. In Sweden 1903, Filip Lundberg published a thesis containing work, now considered fundamental and pioneering, where he proposed to model insurance claims with a homogeneous Poisson process. In Denmark in 1909 another discovery occurred when A.K. Erlang derived the Poisson distribution when developing a mathematical model for the number of incoming phone calls in a finite time interval. Erlang was not at the time aware of Poisson's earlier work and assumed that the number phone calls arriving in each interval of time were independent to each other. He then found the limiting case, which is effectively recasting the Poisson distribution as a limit of the binomial distribution. In 1910 Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger published experimental results on counting alpha particles. Their experimental work had mathematical contributions from Harry Bateman, who derived Poisson probabilities as a solution to a family of differential equations, though the solution had been derived earlier, resulting in the independent discovery of the Poisson process. After this time there were many studies and applications of the Poisson process, but its early history is complicated, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and various physical scientists. =Early applications= The years after 1909 led to a number of studies and applications of the Poisson point process, however, its early history is complex, which has been explained by the various applications of the process in numerous fields by biologists, ecologists, engineers and others working in the physical sciences. The early results were published in different languages and in different settings, with no standard terminology and notation used. For example, in 1922 Swedish chemist and Nobel Laureate Theodor Svedberg proposed a model in which a spatial Poisson point process is the underlying process in order to study how plants are distributed in plant communities. A number of mathematicians started studying the process in the early 1930s, and important contributions were made by Andrey Kolmogorov, William Feller and Aleksandr Khinchin, among others. In the field of teletraffic engineering, mathematicians and statisticians studied and used Poisson and other point processes. =History of terms= The Swede Conny Palm in his 1943 dissertation studied the Poisson and other point processes in the one-dimensional setting by examining them in terms of the statistical or stochastic dependence between the points in time. In his work exists the first known recorded use of the term point processes as Punktprozesse in German. It is believed that William Feller was the first in print to refer to it as the Poisson process in a 1940 paper. Although the Swede Ove Lundberg used the term Poisson process in his 1940 PhD dissertation, in which Feller was acknowledged as an influence,J. Grandell. Mixed poisson processes, volume 77. CRC Press, 1997. it has been claimed that Feller coined the term before 1940. It has been remarked that both Feller and Lundberg used the term as though it were well- known, implying it was already in spoken use by then. Feller worked from 1936 to 1939 alongside Harald Cram√©r at Stockholm University, where Lundberg was a PhD student under Cram√©r who did not use the term Poisson process in a book by him, finished in 1936, but did in subsequent editions, which his has led to the speculation that the term Poisson process was coined sometime between 1936 and 1939 at the Stockholm University. Terminology The terminology of point process theory in general has been criticized for being too varied. In addition to the word point often being omitted, the homogeneous Poisson (point) process is also called a stationary Poisson (point) process, as well as uniform Poisson (point) process. The inhomogeneous Poisson point process, as well as being called nonhomogeneous, is also referred to as the non- stationary Poisson process. The term point process has been criticized, as the term process can suggest over time and space, so random point field, resulting in the terms Poisson random point field or Poisson point field being also used.G. Mikhailov and T. Averina. Statistical modeling of inhomogeneous random functions on the basis of poisson point fields. In Doklady Mathematics, volume 82, pages 701‚Äì704. Springer, 2010. A point process is considered, and sometimes called, a random counting measure,I. Molchanov. Theory of random sets. Springer Science \\\\& Business Media, 2006. hence the Poisson point process is also referred to as a Poisson random measure,K. Sato. L√©vy processes and infinite divisibility, 1999. a term used in the study of L√©vy processes,V. Mandrekar and B. R√ºdiger. Stochastic Integration in Banach Spaces. Springer, 2015. but some choose to use the two terms for Poisson points processes defined on two different underlying spaces.D. Applebaum. L√©vy processes and stochastic calculus. Cambridge university press, 2009. The underlying mathematical space of the Poisson point process is called a carrier space,E. F. Harding and R. Davidson. Stochastic geometry: a tribute to the memory of Rollo Davidson. Wiley, 1974.L. H. Chen and A. Xia. Stein's method, Palm theory and Poisson process approximation. Annals of probability, pages 2545‚Äì2569, 2004. or state space, though the latter term has a different meaning in the context of stochastic processes. In the context of point processes, the term \\"state space\\" can mean the space on which the point process is defined such as the real line, which corresponds to the index set or parameter set in stochastic process terminology. The measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda is called the intensity measure, mean measure, or parameter measure, as there are no standard terms. If \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda has a derivative or density, denoted by \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x), is called the intensity function of the Poisson point process. For the homogeneous Poisson point process, the derivative of the intensity measure is simply a constant \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda>0, which can be referred to as the rate,usually when the underlying space is the real line, or the intensity. It is also called the mean rate or the mean density or rate . For \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda=1, the corresponding process is sometimes referred to as the standard Poisson (point) process.J. Grandell. Point processes and random measures. Advances in Applied Probability, pages 502‚Äì526, 1977. The extent of the Poisson point process is sometimes called the exposure. Notation The notation of the Poisson point process depends on its setting and the field it is being applied in. For example, on the real line, the Poisson process, both homogeneous or inhomogeneous, is sometimes interpreted as a counting process, and the notation \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{N(t), t\\\\geq 0\\\\\\\\} is used to represent the Poisson process. Another reason for varying notation is due to the theory of point processes, which has a couple of mathematical interpretations. For example, a simple Poisson point process may be considered as a random set, which suggests the notation \\\\textstyle x\\\\in {N}, implying that \\\\textstyle x is a random point belonging to or being an element of the Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N}. Another, more general, interpretation is to consider a Poisson or any other point process as a random counting measure, so one can write the number of points of a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} being found or located in some (Borel measurable) region \\\\textstyle B as \\\\textstyle {N}(B), which is a random variable. These different interpretations results in notation being used from mathematical fields such as measure theory and set theory. For general point processes, sometimes a subscript on the point symbol, for example \\\\textstyle x, is included so one writes (with set notation) \\\\textstyle x_i\\\\in{N} instead of \\\\textstyle x\\\\in{N}, and \\\\textstyle x can be used for the dummy variable in integral expressions such as Campbell's theorem, instead of denoting random points. Sometimes an uppercase letter denotes the point process, while a lowercase denotes a point from the process, so, for example, the point \\\\textstyle x or \\\\textstyle x_i belongs to or is a point of the point process \\\\textstyle X, and be written with set notation as \\\\textstyle x\\\\in X or \\\\textstyle x_i\\\\in X. Furthermore, the set theory and integral or measure theory notation can be used interchangeably. For example, for a point process \\\\textstyle N defined on the Euclidean state space \\\\textstyle {\\\\textbf{R}^d} and a (measurable) function \\\\textstyle f on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d , the expression : \\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d} f(x)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dN(x)=\\\\sum\\\\limits_{x_i\\\\in N} f(x_i), demonstrates two different ways to write a summation over a point process (see also Campbell's theorem (probability)). More specifically, the integral notation on the left-hand side is interpreting the point process as a random counting measure while the sum on the right-hand side suggests a random set interpretation. Functionals and moment measures In probability theory, operations are applied to random variables for different purposes. Sometimes these operations are regular expectations that produce the average or variance of a random variable. Others, such as characteristic functions (or Laplace transforms) of a random variable can be used to uniquely identify or characterize random variables and prove results like the central limit theorem.A. Karr. Probability. Springer Texts in Statistics Series. Springer- Verlag, 1993. In the theory of point processes there exist analogous mathematical tools which usually exist in the forms of measures and functionals instead of moments and functions respectively. =Laplace functionals= For a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda, the Laplace functional is given by: : L_N(f)=e^{-\\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d}(1-e^{-f(x)})\\\\Lambda(\\\\mathrm dx)}, : L_N(f)=e^{-\\\\lambda\\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d}(1-e^{-f(x)})\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx}. One version of Campbell's theorem involves the Laplace functional of the Poisson point process. =Probability generating functionals= The probability generating function of non-negative integer-valued random variable leads to the probability generating functional being defined analogously with respect to any non-negative bounded function \\\\textstyle v on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d such that \\\\textstyle 0\\\\leq v(x) \\\\leq 1. For a point process \\\\textstyle {N} the probability generating functional is defined as: : G(v)=E\\\\left[\\\\prod_{x\\\\in N} v(x) \\\\right] where the product is performed for all the points in \\\\textstyle {N}. If the intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda of \\\\textstyle {N} is locally finite, then the \\\\textstyle G is well-defined for any measurable function \\\\textstyle u on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d. For a Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the generating functional is given by: : G(v)=e^{-\\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d} [1-v(x)]\\\\,\\\\Lambda(\\\\mathrm dx)}, which in the homogeneous case reduces to : G(v)=e^{-\\\\lambda\\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d} [1-v(x)]\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx}. =Moment measure= For a general Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the first moment measure is its intensity measure: : M^1(B)=\\\\Lambda(B), which for a homogeneous Poisson point process with constant intensity \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda means: : M^1(B)=\\\\lambdaB, where \\\\textstyle B is the length, area or volume (or more generally, the Lebesgue measure) of \\\\textstyle B. =The Mecke equation= The Mecke equation characterizes the Poisson point process. Let \\\\mathbb{N}_\\\\sigma be the space of all \\\\sigma-finite measures on some general space \\\\mathcal{Q}. A point process \\\\eta with intensity \\\\lambda on \\\\mathcal{Q} is a Poisson point process if and only if for all measurable functions f:\\\\mathcal{Q}\\\\times\\\\mathbb{N}_\\\\sigma\\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}_+ the following holds :\\\\operatorname E \\\\left[\\\\int f(x,\\\\eta)\\\\eta(\\\\mathrm{d}x)\\\\right]=\\\\int \\\\operatorname E \\\\left[ f(x,\\\\eta+\\\\delta_x) \\\\right] \\\\lambda(\\\\mathrm{d}x) For further details see . =Factorial moment measure= For a general Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment measure is given by the expression: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)=\\\\prod_{i=1}^n[\\\\Lambda(B_i)], where \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda is the intensity measure or first moment measure of \\\\textstyle {N}, which for some Borel set \\\\textstyle B is given by : \\\\Lambda(B)=M^1(B)=E[N(B)]. For a homogeneous Poisson point process the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment measure is simply: : M^{(n)}(B_1\\\\times\\\\cdots\\\\times B_n)=\\\\lambda^n \\\\prod_{i=1}^n B_i, where \\\\textstyle B_i is the length, area, or volume (or more generally, the Lebesgue measure) of \\\\textstyle B_i. Furthermore, the \\\\textstyle n-th factorial moment density is: : \\\\mu^{(n)}(x_1,\\\\dots,x_n)=\\\\lambda^n. Avoidance function The avoidance function or void probability \\\\textstyle v of a point process \\\\textstyle {N} is defined in relation to some set \\\\textstyle B, which is a subset of the underlying space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, as the probability of no points of \\\\textstyle {N} existing in \\\\textstyle B. More precisely, for a test set \\\\textstyle B, the avoidance function is given by: : v(B)=P({N}(B)=0). For a general Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda, its avoidance function is given by: : v(B)=e^{-\\\\Lambda(B)} =R√©nyi's theorem= Simple point processes are completely characterized by their void probabilities. In other words, complete information of a simple point process is captured entirely in its void probabilities, and two simple point processes have the same void probabilities if and if only if they are the same point processes. The case for Poisson process is sometimes known as R√©nyi's theorem, which is named after Alfr√©d R√©nyi who discovered the result for the case of a homogeneous point process in one-dimension. In one form, the R√©nyi's theorem says for a diffuse (or non-atomic) Radon measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d and a set \\\\textstyle A is a finite union of rectangles (so not Borel) that if \\\\textstyle {N} is a countable subset of \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d such that: : P({N}(A)=0)=v(A)=e^{-\\\\Lambda(A)} then \\\\textstyle {N} is a Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda. Point process operations Mathematical operations can be performed on point processes in order to get new point processes and develop new mathematical models for the locations of certain objects. One example of an operation is known as thinning which entails deleting or removing the points of some point process according to a rule, creating a new process with the remaining points (the deleted points also form a point process). =Thinning= For the Poisson process, the independent \\\\textstyle p(x)-thinning operations results in another Poisson point process. More specifically, a \\\\textstyle p(x)-thinning operation applied to a Poisson point process with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda gives a point process of removed points that is also Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N}_p with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda_p, which for a bounded Borel set \\\\textstyle B is given by: : \\\\Lambda_p(B)= \\\\int_B p(x)\\\\,\\\\Lambda(\\\\mathrm dx) This thinning result of the Poisson point process is sometimes known as Prekopa's theorem. Furthermore, after randomly thinning a Poisson point process, the kept or remaining points also form a Poisson point process, which has the intensity measure : \\\\Lambda_p(B)= \\\\int_B (1-p(x))\\\\,\\\\Lambda(\\\\mathrm dx). The two separate Poisson point processes formed respectively from the removed and kept points are stochastically independent of each other. In other words, if a region is known to contain \\\\textstyle n kept points (from the original Poisson point process), then this will have no influence on the random number of removed points in the same region. This ability to randomly create two independent Poisson point processes from one is sometimes known as splitting D. Bertsekas and J. Tsitsiklis. Introduction to probability, ser. Athena Scientific optimization and computation series. Athena Scientific, 2008.J. F. Hayes. Modeling and analysis of computer communications networks. Perseus Publishing, 1984. the Poisson point process. =Superposition= If there is a countable collection of point processes \\\\textstyle {N}_1,{N}_2\\\\dots, then their superposition, or, in set theory language, their union, which is : {N}=\\\\bigcup_{i=1}^{\\\\infty}{N}_i, also forms a point process. In other words, any points located in any of the point processes \\\\textstyle {N}_1,{N}_2\\\\dots will also be located in the superposition of these point processes \\\\textstyle {N}. Superposition theorem The superposition theorem of the Poisson point process says that the superposition of independent Poisson point processes \\\\textstyle {N}_1,{N}_2\\\\dots with mean measures \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda_1,\\\\Lambda_2,\\\\dots will also be a Poisson point process with mean measure : \\\\Lambda=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\Lambda_i. In other words, the union of two (or countably more) Poisson processes is another Poisson process. If a point x is sampled from a countable n union of Poisson processes, then the probability that the point \\\\textstyle x belongs to the jth Poisson process N_j is given by: : P (x\\\\in N_j)=\\\\frac{\\\\Lambda_j}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n\\\\Lambda_i}. For two homogeneous Poisson processes with intensities \\\\lambda_1,\\\\lambda_2\\\\dots, the two previous expressions reduce to : \\\\lambda=\\\\sum_{i=1}^\\\\infty \\\\lambda_i, and : P (x\\\\in{N}_j)=\\\\frac{\\\\lambda_j}{\\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\lambda_i}. =Clustering= The operation clustering is performed when each point \\\\textstyle x of some point process \\\\textstyle {N} is replaced by another (possibly different) point process. If the original process \\\\textstyle {N} is a Poisson point process, then the resulting process \\\\textstyle {N}_c is called a Poisson cluster point process. =Random displacement= A mathematical model may require randomly moving points of a point process to other locations on the underlying mathematical space, which gives rise to a point process operation known as displacement or translation. The Poisson point process has been used to model, for example, the movement of plants between generations, owing to the displacement theorem, which loosely says that the random independent displacement of points of a Poisson point process (on the same underlying space) forms another Poisson point process. Displacement theorem One version of the displacement theorem involves a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle {N} on \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d with intensity function \\\\textstyle \\\\lambda(x). It is then assumed the points of \\\\textstyle {N} are randomly displaced somewhere else in \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d so that each point's displacement is independent and that the displacement of a point formerly at \\\\textstyle x is a random vector with a probability density \\\\textstyle \\\\rho(x,\\\\cdot). Then the new point process \\\\textstyle {N}_D is also a Poisson point process with intensity function : \\\\lambda_D(y)=\\\\int_{\\\\textbf{R}^d} \\\\lambda(x) \\\\rho(x,y)\\\\,\\\\mathrm dx. If the Poisson process is homogeneous with \\\\textstyle\\\\lambda(x) = \\\\lambda > 0 and if \\\\rho(x, y) is a function of y-x, then : \\\\lambda_D(y)=\\\\lambda. In other words, after each random and independent displacement of points, the original Poisson point process still exists. The displacement theorem can be extended such that the Poisson points are randomly displaced from one Euclidean space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d to another Euclidean space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^{d'}, where \\\\textstyle d'\\\\geq 1 is not necessarily equal to \\\\textstyle d. =Mapping= Another property that is considered useful is the ability to map a Poisson point process from one underlying space to another space. Mapping theorem If the mapping (or transformation) adheres to some conditions, then the resulting mapped (or transformed) collection of points also form a Poisson point process, and this result is sometimes referred to as the mapping theorem. The theorem involves some Poisson point process with mean measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda on some underlying space. If the locations of the points are mapped (that is, the point process is transformed) according to some function to another underlying space, then the resulting point process is also a Poisson point process but with a different mean measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda'. More specifically, one can consider a (Borel measurable) function \\\\textstyle f that maps a point process \\\\textstyle {N} with intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda from one space \\\\textstyle S, to another space \\\\textstyle T in such a manner so that the new point process \\\\textstyle {N}' has the intensity measure: : \\\\Lambda(B)'=\\\\Lambda(f^{-1}(B)) with no atoms, where \\\\textstyle B is a Borel set and \\\\textstyle f^{-1} denotes the inverse of the function \\\\textstyle f. If \\\\textstyle {N} is a Poisson point process, then the new process \\\\textstyle {N}' is also a Poisson point process with the intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda'. Approximations with Poisson point processes The tractability of the Poisson process means that sometimes it is convenient to approximate a non-Poisson point process with a Poisson one. The overall aim is to approximate the both number of points of some point process and the location of each point by a Poisson point process.L. H. Chen, A. R√∂llin, et al. Approximating dependent rare events. Bernoulli, 19(4):1243‚Äì1267, 2013. There a number of methods that can be used to justify, informally or rigorously, approximating the occurrence of random events or phenomena with suitable Poisson point processes. The more rigorous methods involve deriving upper bounds on the probability metrics between the Poisson and non-Poisson point processes, while other methods can be justified by less formal heuristics.R. Arratia, S. Tavare, et al. {Review: D. Aldous, Probability Approximations via the Poisson Clumping Heuristic; AD Barbour, L. Holst, S. Janson, Poisson Approximation}. The Annals of Probability, 21(4):2269‚Äì2279, 1993. =Clumping heuristic= One method for approximating random events or phenomena with Poisson processes is called the clumping heuristic.D. Aldous. Poisson Clumping Heuristic. Wiley Online Library, 1989. The general heuristic or principle involves using the Poisson point process (or Poisson distribution) to approximate events, which are considered rare or unlikely, of some stochastic process. In some cases these rare events are close to being independent, hence a Poisson point process can be used. When the events are not independent, but tend to occur in clusters or clumps, then if these clumps are suitably defined such that they are approximately independent of each other, then the number of clumps occurring will be close to a Poisson random variable and the locations of the clumps will be close to a Poisson process. =Stein's method= Stein's method is a mathematical technique originally developed for approximating random variables such as Gaussian and Poisson variables, which has also been applied to point processes. Stein's method can be used to derive upper bounds on probability metrics, which give way to quantify how different two random mathematical objects vary stochastically.A. D. Barbour and T. C. Brown. Stein's method and point process approximation. Stochastic Processes and their Applications, 43(1):9‚Äì31, 1992. Upperbounds on probability metrics such as total variation and Wasserstein distance have been derived. Researchers have applied Stein's method to Poisson point processes in a number of ways, such as using Palm calculus. Techniques based on Stein's method have been developed to factor into the upper bounds the effects of certain point process operations such as thinning and superposition.D. Schuhmacher. Distance estimates for dependent superpositions of point processes. Stochastic processes and their applications, 115(11):1819‚Äì1837, 2005.D. Schuhmacher. Distance estimates for poisson process approximations of dependent thinnings. Electronic Journal of Probability, 10:165‚Äì201, 2005. Stein's method has also been used to derive upper bounds on metrics of Poisson and other processes such as the Cox point process, which is a Poisson process with a random intensity measure. Convergence to a Poisson point process In general, when an operation is applied to a general point process the resulting process is usually not a Poisson point process. For example, if a point process, other than a Poisson, has its points randomly and independently displaced, then the process would not necessarily be a Poisson point process. However, under certain mathematical conditions for both the original point process and the random displacement, it has been shown via limit theorems that if the points of a point process are repeatedly displaced in a random and independent manner, then the finite-distribution of the point process will converge (weakly) to that of a Poisson point process. Similar convergence results have been developed for thinning and superposition operations that show that such repeated operations on point processes can, under certain conditions, result in the process converging to a Poisson point processes, provided a suitable rescaling of the intensity measure (otherwise values of the intensity measure of the resulting point processes would approach zero or infinity). Such convergence work is directly related to the results known as the Palm‚ÄìKhinchin equations, which has its origins in the work of Conny Palm and Aleksandr Khinchin, and help explains why the Poisson process can often be used as a mathematical model of various random phenomena. Generalizations of Poisson point processes The Poisson point process can be generalized by, for example, changing its intensity measure or defining on more general mathematical spaces. These generalizations can be studied mathematically as well as used to mathematically model or represent physical phenomena. =Poisson-type random measures= The Poisson-type random measures (PT) are a family of three random counting measures which are closed under restriction to a subspace, i.e. closed under Point_process_operation#Thinning. These random measures are examples of the mixed binomial process and share the distributional self-similarity property of the Poisson random measure. They are the only members of the canonical non-negative power series family of distributions to possess this property and include the Poisson distribution, negative binomial distribution, and binomial distribution. The Poisson random measure is independent on disjoint subspaces, whereas the other PT random measures (negative binomial and binomial) have positive and negative covariances. The PT random measures are discussedCaleb Bastian, Gregory Rempala. Throwing stones and collecting bones: Looking for Poisson-like random measures, Mathematical Methods in the Applied Sciences, 2020. doi:10.1002/mma.6224 and include the Poisson random measure, negative binomial random measure, and binomial random measure. =Poisson point processes on more general spaces= For mathematical models the Poisson point process is often defined in Euclidean space, but has been generalized to more abstract spaces and plays a fundamental role in the study of random measures, which requires an understanding of mathematical fields such as probability theory, measure theory and topology. In general, the concept of distance is of practical interest for applications, while topological structure is needed for Palm distributions, meaning that point processes are usually defined on mathematical spaces with metrics.A. E. Gelfand, P. Diggle, P. Guttorp, and M. Fuentes. Handbook of spatial statistics, Chapter 9. CRC press, 2010. Furthermore, a realization of a point process can be considered as a counting measure, so points processes are types of random measures known as random counting measures. In this context, the Poisson and other point processes has been studied on a locally compact second countable Hausdorff space.O. Kallenberg. Random measures. Academic Pr, 1983. =Cox point process= A Cox point process, Cox process or doubly stochastic Poisson process is a generalization of the Poisson point process by letting its intensity measure \\\\textstyle \\\\Lambda to be also random and independent of the underlying Poisson process. The process is named after David Cox who introduced it in 1955, though other Poisson processes with random intensities had been independently introduced earlier by Lucien Le Cam and Maurice Quenouille. The intensity measure may be a realization of random variable or a random field. For example, if the logarithm of the intensity measure is a Gaussian random field, then the resulting process is known as a log Gaussian Cox process.J. M√∏ller, A. R. Syversveen, and R. P. Waagepetersen. Log Gaussian Cox Processes. Scandinavian journal of statistics, 25(3):451‚Äì482, 1998. More generally, the intensity measures is a realization of a non-negative locally finite random measure. Cox point processes exhibit a clustering of points, which can be shown mathematically to be larger than those of Poisson point processes. The generality and tractability of Cox processes has resulted in them being used as models in fields such as spatial statisticsJ. M√∏ller and R. P. Waagepetersen. Modern statistics for spatial point processes. Scandinavian Journal of Statistics, 34(4):643‚Äì684, 2007. and wireless networks. =Marked Poisson point process= An illustration of a marked point process, where the unmarked point process is defined on the positive real line, which often represents time. The random marks take on values in the state space S known as the mark space. Any such marked point process can be interpreted as an unmarked point process on the space [0,\\\\infty]\\\\times S . The marking theorem says that if the original unmarked point process is a Poisson point process and the marks are stochastically independent, then the marked point process is also a Poisson point process on [0,\\\\infty]\\\\times S . If the Poisson point process is homogeneous, then the gaps \\\\tau_i in the diagram are drawn from an exponential distribution. For a given point process, each random point of a point process can have a random mathematical object, known as a mark, randomly assigned to it. These marks can be as diverse as integers, real numbers, lines, geometrical objects or other point processes. The pair consisting of a point of the point process and its corresponding mark is called a marked point, and all the marked points form a marked point process. It is often assumed that the random marks are independent of each other and identically distributed, yet the mark of a point can still depend on the location of its corresponding point in the underlying (state) space. If the underlying point process is a Poisson point process, then the resulting point process is a marked Poisson point process. Marking theorem If a general point process is defined on some mathematical space and the random marks are defined on another mathematical space, then the marked point process is defined on the Cartesian product of these two spaces. For a marked Poisson point process with independent and identically distributed marks, the marking theorem states that this marked point process is also a (non-marked) Poisson point process defined on the aforementioned Cartesian product of the two mathematical spaces, which is not true for general point processes. =Compound Poisson point process= The compound Poisson point process or compound Poisson process is formed by adding random values or weights to each point of Poisson point process defined on some underlying space, so the process is constructed from a marked Poisson point process, where the marks form a collection of independent and identically distributed non-negative random variables. In other words, for each point of the original Poisson process, there is an independent and identically distributed non-negative random variable, and then the compound Poisson process is formed from the sum of all the random variables corresponding to points of the Poisson process located in some region of the underlying mathematical space. If there is a marked Poisson point process formed from a Poisson point process \\\\textstyle N (defined on, for example, \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d) and a collection of independent and identically distributed non-negative marks \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{M_i\\\\\\\\} such that for each point \\\\textstyle x_i of the Poisson process \\\\textstyle N there is a non- negative random variable \\\\textstyle M_i, the resulting compound Poisson process is then: : C(B)=\\\\sum_{i=1}^{N(B)} M_i , where \\\\textstyle B\\\\subset \\\\textbf{R}^d is a Borel measurable set. If general random variables \\\\textstyle \\\\\\\\{M_i\\\\\\\\} take values in, for example, \\\\textstyle d-dimensional Euclidean space \\\\textstyle \\\\textbf{R}^d, the resulting compound Poisson process is an example of a L√©vy process provided that it is formed from a homogeneous Point process \\\\textstyle N defined on the non-negative numbers \\\\textstyle [0, \\\\infty) . =Failure process with the exponential smoothing of intensity functions= The failure process with the exponential smoothing of intensity functions (FP-ESI) is an extension of the nonhomogeneous Poisson process. The intensity function of an FP-ESI is an exponential smoothing function of the intensity functions at the last time points of event occurrences and outperforms other nine stochastic processes on 8 real-world failure datasets when the models are used to fit the datasets,Wu, S. (2019). A failure process model with the exponential smoothing of intensity functions.

Current FOCE systems control experimental CO2 perturbations by real-time monitoring of differences in seawater pH between treatment (i.e. high-CO2) and control (i.e. ambient) seawater within experimental enclosures.Brewer P. G., Kirkwood W. J. & Gattuso J.-P., 2013. xFOCE systems: present status and future developments. Eos 94:152. doi:10.1002/2013EO160004.  Overview  In situ, controlled perturbation experiments, often conducted over weeks to months, can provide inference concerning the response of natural communities to ocean acidification that is difficult or impossible to derive from laboratory experiments. Studies conducted in situ can include the effects of potentially important factors such as natural variation in planktonic food resources, larval abundance, changes in predators or competitors, as well as oceanographic conditions (e.g. changes in upwelling intensity). Drawing on the experience of Free Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE) experiments used to investigate the response of terrestrial plant communities to rising atmospheric CO2 levels, the scientific community has developed an analogous approach, Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment (FOCE) experiments, for studying marine communities, and to complement a range of experimental methods and technologies for ocean acidification studies research. FOCE was first proposed and implemented by researchers at the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI). Purpose As studies of the consequences of ocean acidification for marine organisms and ecosystems expanded rapidly over the past decade, the methods employed to evaluate the effects of expected future changes in ocean chemistry have become more sophisticated. Initial studies frequently involved measurements of the survival or physiological response of individuals of marine species to large changes in pCO2 or pH, while held in small containers under laboratory conditions. This approach increased the level of understanding of the effects of these environmental changes on individual species but provided little information concerning the response of natural assemblages of interacting species, in which the direct impacts of ocean acidification as well as their cascading indirect consequences (e.g. changes in the intensity of interaction strengths among predators or competitors) may be evident. Pelagic mesocosm experiments that examined the response of natural plankton communities to controlled pH perturbations helped move methods of ocean acidification research toward more comprehensive studies of whole communities and embedded processes under mostly natural conditions.Riebesell U., Czerny J., von Br√∂ckel K., Boxhammer T., B√ºdenbender J., Deckelnick M., Fischer M., Hoffmann D., Krug S. A., Lentz U., Ludwig A., Muche R. & Schulz K. G., 2013. Technical Note: A mobile sea-going mesocosm system ‚Äì new opportunities for ocean change research. Biogeosciences 10:1835‚Äì1847. The FOCE approach represents an analogous advance for benthic assemblages, by allowing examination of the direct effects of acidification on particular species, but also potential changes in interactions among species. Moreover, FOCE methods provide precise control of pH, while allowing many other parameters to vary naturally. Like mesocosm studies, FOCE methods exploit the advantages of studying a natural community under mostly natural ranges of environmental variability. Methods The key elements of any FOCE experimental units are perspex, partially open, chambers, a CO2 mixing system, sensors to continuously monitor ambient and chamber pH, and a control loop to regulate the addition of gases or liquids to each experimental chamber. The carbonate chemistry of seawater can be manipulated using different approaches to mimic future conditions.Gattuso J.-P. & Lavigne H., 2009. Technical Note: Approaches and software tools to investigate the impact of ocean acidification. Biogeosciences 6:2121‚Äì2133. It is possible to directly inject gases (pure CO2 or CO2-enriched air) but this is more difficult than delivering water to achieve precise pH control. Current FOCE systems lower pH using metered addition of CO2-enriched seawater into the experimental chambers. pH is controlled as a constant pH offset relative to ambient values, maintaining natural variability, or as a constant value. Other approaches have been used to manipulate the seawater carbonate chemistry in the field. In pelagic mesocosm experiments, the carbonate chemistry is generally altered at the beginning of the experiment and subsequently drifts as a function of biological processes and air-sea gas transfer. CO2 bubbling in open water has also been used.Arnold T., Mealey C., Leahey H., Miller A. W., Hall-Spencer J. M., Milazzo M. & Maers K., 2012. Ocean acidification and the loss of phenolic substances in marine plants. PLoS ONE 7, e35107. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0035107. This approach does not enable precise control of the carbonate chemistry because it does not include a device to ensure full equilibration of added CO2 in seawater and its precise control. There are no experimental chambers to regulate water flow, and thus allows for natural near-bottom flow conditions, but it generates highly variable pH under variable current speed or direction. This approach is therefore more similar to natural CO2 vents than to FOCE systems. Current users of FOCE systems have organized to release guidelines and best practices information for future users. Furthermore, the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute will release an open source package to transfer FOCE technology to interested researchers (xFOCE). This package will comprise all engineering information required to develop cost effective FOCE systems. Future development of FOCE systems will include the study of the combined effects of ocean acidification and other environmental factors such as temperature or the concentration of dissolved oxygen. Current FOCE Projects=Deep FOCE (dpFOCE)= A FOCE system for studies of deep-sea benthic communities (designated dp-FOCE) was developed by Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute. The dpFOCE project, deployed at a depth of 900 m, was attached to the MARS cabled seafloor observatory in Monterey Bay, central California. The system used a flume concept for maintaining greater control over the experimental volume while still maintaining access to natural seafloor sediments and suspended particulate material. Time-delay wings attached to either end of the dpFOCE chamber allow for tidally driven changes in near-bottom currents, and provide sufficient time for full hydration of the injected CO2 enriched seawater before entering into the experiment chamber. Fans are integrated into the dpFOCE design to control flow rates through the experimental chamber and to simulate typical local-scale flow conditions. Multiple sensors (pH, CTD, ADV, and ADCP) used in conjunction with the fans and the enriched seawater injection system allow the control loop software to achieve the desired pH offset. dpFOCE connects to shore via the MARS cabled observatory, which provides power and data bandwidth. Enriched CO2 seawater is produced from liquid CO2 held in a small container near the dpFOCE chamber; seawater flowing slowly over the top of the liquid CO2 dissolves some of the liquid CO2 producing a CO2-rich dissolution plume used for injection into the dpFOCE chamber. The dpFOCE system operated over 17 months and verified the effectiveness of the design hardware and software.Kirkwood W. J., Peltzer E. T., Walz P., Headley K., Herlien B., Kecy C., Maughan T., O'Reilly T., Salamy K. A., Shane F., Scholfield J. & Brewer P. G., 2011. Cabled instrument technologies for ocean acidification research - FOCE (Free Ocean CO2 Enrichment). In: (Eds.), Underwater Technology (UT), 2011 IEEE Symposium on and 2011 Workshop on Scientific Use of Submarine Cables and Related Technologies. =Coral Prototype FOCE (cpFOCE)= The cpFOCE uses replicate experimental flumes to enclose sections of a coral reef and dose them with CO2-enriched seawater using peristaltic pumps with computer controlled feedback loop to maintain a specified pH offset from ambient conditions. A cpFOCE chamber has forward and rear flow conditioners on either end to accommodate bidirectional ocean currents. The openings are placed parallel to the dominant axis of tidal currents over the reef flat, and the chamber is anchored with sand stakes. The flow conditioners are attached to maximize turbulence and provide passive mixing of the CO2 enriched seawater. Four of the tubes in the flow conditioners furthest from the chamber have small holes along their length through which low pH water is pumped to dispense it evenly along the entire width and height of the conditioner. The flow conditioners are also painted white to minimize heating and algal growth. The cpFOCE system was deployed at Heron Island (Great Barrier Reef) to investigate the response of coral communities to ocean acidification.Kline D. I., Teneva L., Schneider K., Miard T., Chai A., Marker M., Headley K., Opdyke B., Nash M., Valetich M., Caves J. K., Russell B. D., Connell S. D., Kirkwood B.

A short-term in situ CO2 enrichment experiment on Heron Island (GBR). Scientific Reports 2:413.doi:10.1038/srep00413. =European FOCE (eFOCE)= The European FOCE (eFOCE) comprises two open-top chambers (control and experimental) as well as a surface buoy housing the electronics and pumps to produce CO2-enriched water. The system is powered by solar and wind energy. Data packets are wirelessly sent to the nearby laboratory and can be monitored on the internet. The eFOCE system is currently deployed in the bay of Villefranche-sur-mer (France) at about 12 m depth and 300 m offshore. The eFOCE project has been developed to investigate the long-term effects of acidification on benthic marine communities of the North West Mediterranean Sea, especially Posidonia seagrass beds. Over a 3-year period, the aim of the project is to develop relatively long (> 6 month) experiments. =Shallow Water FOCE (swFOCE)= In collaboration with Hopkins Marine Station and the Center for Ocean Solutions, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute is developing a swFOCE system to examine the effects of ocean acidification on shallow subtidal communities in central California. swFOCE will use a shore side station for the control system and production of CO2 enriched seawater, and will also use and will use an existing cabled observational and research platform to connect the swFOCE node. Two swFOCE chambers will be installed initially at a depth of 15 m, approximately 250 m offshore. The nearby node of the cabled observatorynode, has instruments to monitor local currents, temperature, pH, and O2 in real-time, as a cabled observatory platform for scientific research. =Antarctic FOCE (AntFOCE)= The first polar FOCE (antFOCE) experiment was awarded funding in November 2012, followed by design and concept studies initiated in 2013. Installation and initial science experiments are planned for 2014. antFOCE is a collaborative effort between the University of Tasmania, Australian Antarctic Division, Antarctic Climate & Ecosystems Cooperative Research Centre, Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute and specialist ocean acidification policy advisors from the International Ocean Acidification Reference Users Group (IOA-RUG). The IOA-RUG will take the lead in communicating the outcomes of the FOCE experiment to global climate and ocean policy related organizations. References :7. Ainsworth E. A. & Long S. P., 2005.

After going undrafted in the 2012 NBA draft he has played for teams in Cyprus, France, and Mexico. College career Horton attended Ossining High School in Ossining, New York before enrolling at Central Connecticut State University (CCSU) as a freshman in 2007. In 2007‚Äì08, Horton averaged 12.7 points and 5.4 rebounds per game and was named to the All-Northeast Conference (NEC) Rookie Team. He recorded 63 blocks on the season, good for the fourth-most in school history while also becoming the first freshman since 1996‚Äì97 to lead the NEC in that category. The following season, Horton was named a Second Team all-conference performer. He led the Blue Devils and was third in the conference with 16.5 points per game while his 5.8 rebounds also topped his team. Due to an injury, he was forced to redshirt (sit out) his junior year in 2009‚Äì10. When Horton returned as a redshirt junior in 2010‚Äì11, he proved himself to be the class of the Northeast Conference. He led the league in scoring at 19.5 points per outing, was third in rebounding with 8.9 per game, scored 20+ points 14 times and 30+ points on four occasions. He also led the NEC in double-doubles (12) and accumulated five NEC Player of the Week awards, more than any other player that season. He was named the Northeast Conference Player of the Year, becoming the fifth Blue Devil all-time to earn the award. The Associated Press also named him as an Honorable Mention All-American. Although Horton's senior season in 2011‚Äì12 was statistically comparable to his breakout junior season (19.0 points, 8.9 rebounds per game), he failed to repeat as the conference's player of the year. He did finish his collegiate career, however, as Central Connecticut's all-time men's basketball leading scorer with 1,966 career points. Professional career Horton was invited to participate in the 2012 Portsmouth Invitational Tournament, an annual event that showcases 64 of the top graduating seniors across the country for NBA scouts. However, he did not get selected in that year's NBA draft. Horton then began to pursue his professional career overseas. His first stop was in France for Stade Olympique Maritime Boulonnais, followed by Cyprus' Apollon Limassol. In the 2013‚Äì14 season he played for Huracanes de Tampico in Mexico and for the 2014-15 season he signed with the Finnish club Kataja Basket. Horton played for √âlan B√©arnais Pau-Orthez in France in the 2017-18 season, during which time he averaged 11.9 points and 5.3 rebounds per game. On September 5, 2018, he signed with Astana of the Kazakhstan Championship. On June 24, 2019, he has signed 1 year deal with Germani Basket Brescia of the LBA. Horton averaged 11 points and 5 rebounds per game. On August 6, 2020, he signed with San Pablo Burgos of the Liga ACB. With Burgos, he won the 2019‚Äì20 Basketball Champions League.

The live streaming website shows the parent eagles and their family as they build and restore the nest, mate, lay eggs, and challenge the natural elements and predators in the area. The site launched with one camera in September 2012. It is one of more than a dozen eagle webcams across America. The live webcam was set up by the landowner's company, Dick Pritchett Real Estate, to observe the eagles in their natural habitat in hopes of providing an educational and learning experience.  About the Nest This nest is labeled LE026-B of the Florida State Monitoring Program. It has been monitored for 6 years. The first year was when the nest was across the street in 2007. The pair relocated the nest in 2006-2007 to its present location. A typical nest is around 5 feet in diameter. Eagles often use the same nest year after year. Over the years, some nests become enormous, as much as 9 feet in diameter, weighing two tons. The Southwest Florida Eagle Cam nest is approximately 8 feet in diameter and a short one mile flight away from the Caloosahatchee River, which serves as their primary food source. The pair of eagles rely mostly on fish from the river (Mullet, Catfish, Red Fish, Snook, Gar), but may also eat small rodents if the opportunity presents itself. According to the Florida Fish and Wildlife Service, who tracks Bald Eagle nests, M15 and Harriet have 133 neighbors in a 25-mile radius. Their closest neighbor is 1 mile away.  About the Cameras To preserve the natural habitat of the eagles, the camera is positioned six feet above the nest and is attached to a tree limb, using no screws or nails. The noiseless camera also uses night vision. This feature allows the camera to see at night without disturbing the eagles. For season 2, Dick Pritchett Real Estate installed two cameras, hoping to enhance the viewing experience. In addition to the nest camera (camera #1), camera #2 is located approximately 60 feet from the nest and has the ability to capture images of the nest action outside of Camera #1. Both cameras are environmentally friendly, non-intrusive and positioned to offer the best view of the nest and birds while preserving the pristine beauty of the nest and their surroundings.  Harriet and Ozzie and Ozzie's death  Harriet and Ozzie received their names by the landowners and area birdwatchers who fell in love with the duo from a distance. Their names are based on an American sitcom, The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet. They have been coming to this nest for the past 6 years and typically reside in this nest between the months of October and April. On March 17, 2015, Ozzie was found by Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (FWC) officials and taken to the Clinic for Rehabilitation of Wildlife, Inc. (CROW) for evaluation after showing signs of disorientation and injury. After 97 days of care to recover from a broken left clavicle and a broken left coracoid bone, Ozzie was released back into the wild near the nest. On Saturday, September 19, Ozzie made an appearance at the nest. On September 27, after seen fighting with a male eagle in the area, Ozzie was found injured and again admitted back into CROW's care. On Tuesday, September 29, Ozzie died.  Nesting Season History  The U. S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that there are at least 9,789 nesting pairs of bald eagles in the contiguous United States. While the largest concentration of bald eagles is in Alaska, bald eagles can be found in every state except Hawaii with Florida, Wisconsin, Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, and Michigan all having a prevalent bald eagle population. The 2012-2013 (October 2012-May 2013) marked the first year the nest was streamed live to the world. Over 18 million viewers tuned in to watch the adult eagles, Harriet and Ozzie, raise their 2 eaglets (Hope and Honor) from birth to fledge. ‚Ä¢ The 1st egg (E1/Hope) was laid on November 26 at 1:47 pm., hatched January 1, 2013 at 10:44 p.m. and fledged the nest on March 25 at 7:51 a.m. ‚Ä¢ The 2nd egg (E2/Honor) was laid on November 29 at 6:38 pm., hatched January 3, 2013 at 9:49.p.m. and fledged the nest on March 25 at 8:23 a.m. While cameras were not set up to watch the activity prior to 2012, the below activity has been documented about the past nesting seasons: 06-07 2 eaglet fledged 07-08 fledglings not confirmed 08-09 2 eaglets 09-10 1 eaglet 10-11 1 fledgling confirmed 11-12 1 fledgling confirmed 12-13 2 fledglings confirmed via cameras 13-14 2 eaglets 14-15 The first egg (E5) was laid November 19 and hatched (37 days) Dec. 26.

As of March 2019, two eaglets (E12 and E13) are in the nest.  How to Tell Male and Female Apart While it is a big difficult to tell the adult eagles apart, The Southwest Florida Eagle Cam moderators provide the below identifying features: (Female) Harriet *Much larger *Inverted V in front neck ruffles *Dark circles around eyes *Thick/larger beak, larger gape *Black speckles high on tail *Dark heart shape on head, back right *Has a Longer middle talon than O (Male) Now M15 for Male 2015 (about 5 or 6 years old) *Smaller *Ridge over eye has more feather cover. *His eyes appear darker in color than the female. *There is a small dark spot on the right side of his face.  Funding & The Southwest Florida Eagle Cam Foundation The launch of the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam was funded and continues to be majorly supported by the private funds and public donations. The Pritchett Family started the Southwest Florida Eagle Cam Foundation in the Spring of 2013 so viewers and philanthropists could donate to a fund to help maintain the camera for future season of living streaming. The goal of these cameras is to foster appreciation, admiration and respect for these magnificent creatures through the ability to bring these beautiful birds into your homes. The intentions of the Pritchett Family are to learn from these birds so we may better understand them and their habits.

The work was created during the winter of 1934. Hopper writes in his poem about this painting that \\"only the grass, the uncut dead grass, shows where the wind is.\\" The view of the Weehawken street remains mostly unchanged. In 2013, Weehawken resident and comedian Susie Felber commissioned a modern remake of the painting in order to raise money for the Weehawken PTPO (a parent‚Äìteacher participating association). The remake, which was created by Brooklyn-based painter Stephen Gardner, depicts the scene as it appears now, with flowers and satellite dishes, and in lighter tones. Gardner's derivative painting was purchased on eBay for $510 by computer programmer Ligia Builes, who owns the house depicted in the painting. Provenance Hopper made at least eight sketches for the painting which he delivered to his gallerist Frank K.M. Rehn in April 1934. The studies are part of the collection at the Whitney Museum to which Hopper, before his death, decided to leave his unsold work. East Wind Over Weehawken was included in the 1950 Hopper retrospective at the Whitney (New York), Museum of Fine Arts (Boston), and the Detroit Institute of Arts while still in the possession of Frank K.M.

West invested heavily in engineering & aerodynamic development to design the revolutionary and stunning looking WX10, to replace the ageing WR1000. In 2007 West ownership transferred from the Consortium to Eric Vassian and the company moved shop to Buford, Georgia. Vassian was instrumental in a deal that saw West contracted to provide the IMSA Lites L2 class with spec racing sports cars. Vassian also produced the WX10 after 3 years of design and engineering effort. The West WR1000 was the first car produced by West Race Cars with 85 cars produced. In 2009 the first WX10 hit the track and was blindingly fast. The aero alone contributed to an 11 mph top speed gain over the WR1000. The grip level was also increased significantly to make this the fastest sports racer ever. This car featured a factory standard Kawasaki ZX-10R engine. The first season featured eleven different drivers. Among them were Michael Mallinen, Carl Skerlong and Scott Tucker. After having won the AMRS Thunder Sports Championship in a factory fielded West WR1000, Australian driver Tom Drewer raced the 2008 season in the IMSA Lites. The factory team swept the 2008 season. Drewer won 10 out of 12 races and won the championship. Vassian finished second in the championship and won one race. Third factory driver Jim Garrett finished third in the standings. In 2010 West Australia produced a much needed Aero upgrade to the WR1000, a development that even today keeps the WR1000 a force in Sports Racer, with lap records at every major track in Australia. For the next 3 years Steer dominated the category in Australia, contesting a WR1000 Aero, then the new WX10 - 1000 and a 1340 Hayabusa version. In 2011 West with a new owner Level 5, invested massive funds in wind tunnel, suspension engineering and engine development to produce the fastest sports racer, in fact the fastest (by lap time) race car in SCCA history. (2012 Runoffs). From 2012 - 2014 West focussed on delivering base model WX10 vehicles to the US & Australian markets. In late 2013 the West LLC brand, business assets and intellectual property was purchased by West Motorsport Australia who then embarked on a program to turn the Tucker prototype sports racer into a production reality. The new car, due to be released in September 2015 will revolutionise the sports racer concept. All of the Level 5 aero and suspension engineering is now manufactured and standard on all new cars. The all new West WX10-RS includes fully integrated CAN bus / MoTec ECU, XAP Dash, 3rd damper style suspension, Ohlins, PFC brake package and the ZX10R engine (turbo Suzuki available too). =Club racing= In the SCCA the West cars are allowed in the D Sports Racing class. The cars achieved many victories in the many divisions of the SCCA. Kletjian was the first driver in a West at the SCCA National Championship Runoffs and the SCCA June Sprints, the two most prestigious races of the SCCA. Level 5 Motorsports team owner Scott Tucker won the SCCA National Championship Runoffs in the DSR class. Tucker won the 2012 Runoffs in the DSR class driving a West, with the fastest lap ever recorded in any car in any category in SCCA history 1:56:4. In Australia, West sports cars race in the Sports Racer Series.

Chang Moo Kwan was one of the five original Kwans which became Tae Kwon Do in the mid 1950s. In his later life Nam Suk Lee was to make the seaside community of San Pedro, California his home, where he reestablished his traditional roots in Chang Moo Kwan. He was 75 and still actively teaching Chang Moo Kwan through the San Pedro YMCA. Nam Suk Lee died in the neighboring Southern California community of Torrance on August 29, 2000, due to a stroke. Early life After Nam Suk Lee was born in Yeo Joo, a Korean city 40 miles of Seoul, the Lee family moved to Seoul, Korea in the 1930s during Imperialistic Japanese occupation of the Korean Peninsula. Nam Suk Lee had lost a younger brother to an illness prior to relocating to Seoul; he was just a year old. Nam Suk Lee's \\"favorite sport was soccer and he was known to be a dominant player. He loved to study and he assumed leadership position in classroom activities.\\" Nam Suk Lee was born leader and this inclination would later facilitating the gathering of several students to train in what was to become the roots of Chang Moo Kwan. In an interview with his student Jon Wiedenman, Nam Suk Lee relayed the story of the inception, \\"point zero,\\" of Chang Moo Kwan. Nam Suk Lee stumbled upon a martial arts book, a Chinese translation of Gichin Funakoshi's \\"Karate Jutsu\\". If teenage Nam Suk Lee would have been discovered training by the unforgiving Japanese soldiers, death could have been the penalty. Jon Wiedenman presented a republished copy of \\"Karate Jutsu\\" to Nak Suk Lee by Kodansha Publications for his birthday. Putting things in historical perspective, this was a few short years before World War II, and the Japanese troops were gearing up for total domination of Korea and the Far East. In spite of the clear and present danger, young Nam Suk Lee secretively pored over the many black and white photographs of Gichin Funikoshi and soon sifted and extrapolated what he could of the one-dimensional forms and techniques to make the beginnings of his martial art, what would become Chang Moo Kwan. A born leader, Nam Suk Lee, driven to teach, rallied up several recruits to practice his new art. Clandestine, they would diligently practice in a local junior high school playground, behind a high wall, out of eye-shot of the watchful \\"enemy.\\" Nam Suk Lee shared this with Jon Wiedenman in an interview shortly before his death. Nam Suk Lee offered many stories of his trials and tribulations during their time together. One of Wiedenman's favorites was of Nam Suk Lee's students practicing breaking techniques by removing roof tiles from local buildings, Japanese occupied of course, and defiantly demolishing them with various kicks and punches. They did this, of course, to develop focus and penetration targeting. Role in forming Chang Moo Kwan In 1945, WWII ended and Korea was again free to the practice martial arts. In 1946 in Seoul, Korea, Byung In Yoon established a Taekkyeon Club at the Kyung Sung Agricultural School. Chang Moo Kwan was introduced to the YMCA and Nam Suk Lee was the first instructor. In a 2000 interview between Jon Wiedenman and Nam Suk Lee, he was asked how Byung In Yoon became the first Grandmaster of Chang Moo Kwan, and Lee answered, \\"He was two years older than me. A commemorative photo taken the 3rd Regular Promotion Test held at YMCA Seoul, Korea on November 3, 1948. It has been established the late Byung In Yoon, had significant roots in Chuan-Fa which he learned as a youth growing up in Manchuria. Wiedenman notes \\"while training with Nam Suk Lee, I asked him several times where Byung In Yoon's influence could be recognized in our forms. I don't think I ever got an exact answer. Byung In Yoon had trained extensively in Japan under Kanken Toyama in Shudokan. Lee had been self-taught in Funikoshi's Shotokan. I believe it was just an understanding the harder system prevailed.\\" The earliest known photo of Nam Suk Lee and Byung In Yoon is from November 3, 1948 (See Right Hand Photo). It is taken after the 3rd Regular Promotion Test held at the YMCA in Seoul, Korea. At that time a \\"Regular Promotion Test\\" was held twice a year with an intermediate test in- between. One fascinating thing about this photo is the students are wearing \\"Chinese style\\" button up tops. This is most probably indicative of Byung In Yoon's Manchurian Chuan-Fa influence. Participants of the 1st Promotion Test in the Ministry of Communications Chang Moo Kwan Department on December 21, 1948. Another photo taken December 21, 1948 shows the participants attending the 1st Chang Moo Kwan Promotion Test at the Ministry of Communications Department. This was a likely site for Nam Suk Lee's main school as it was also his place of employment. In this photo, students are garbed in doboks similar to Japanese \\"gis.\\" This picture may indicate Lee was applying his personal interpretation of the philosophies, skills, and traditions of Shotokan roots to Chang Moo Kwan. 2nd Chang Moo Kwan demonstration (Nam Suk Lee in shown with square, Byung In Yoon shown with diamond). In a photo depicting the 2nd Chang Moo Kwan Demonstration at the YMCA in Seoul, Korea, the participating students and Nam Suk Lee are wearing traditional uniforms. The Chinese style attire is nonexistent. This would seem to indicate Lee's Shotokan roots dominate, as his forms would later reflect. Understandably, having been subjected to the often harsh tyranny of the Japanese occupied forces in Korea, Lee shined away from things of Japan. Why, one might wonder, would he base his Chang Moo Kwan on an apparently Japanese, Shotokan? Upon closer examination Gichin Funikoshi was an Okinawan expatriate living in Japan teaching an Okinawan martial art. This seemed to work for Nam Suk Lee. Chang Moo Kwan was in no small part responsible for \\"returning normalcy to Korea after WWII.\\" The surge of Chang Moo Kwan growth came to a violent halt as North Korea and South Korea entered a war in 1950, one which has never officially ended. When the Korean War ended in 1953 the country was divided at the 38th parallel in 1953, and Byung In Yoon was missing. The human cost of the Korean War (June 25, 1950 to June 27, 1953) was high and many prominent Korean martial artists served and were MIA or killed, often as commandos or spies. It was up to Nam Suk Lee to carry the torch forward. He did. Once again using the principles and practices of Chang Moo Kwan to help revitalize the spirit of war-torn Korea. Role in expansion of Chang Moo Kwan Ministry of Communications Taekwondo department. From left to right: Lee Un Yong, Kim Sun Koo, Lee Nam Suk, Kwak Sung Kyoo, and Son Chul Joon. In 1953 immediately after the end of the Korean War, Nam Suk Lee hit the ground running with Chang Moo Kwan, implementing his art as a way to help rebuild the Korean spirit, student by student. An employee at the Ministry of Communications, it would make sense this was where he continued teaching Chang Moo Kwan. In December 1953, the 13th Regular Promotion Test was held. Hundreds of students were already embracing and reaping the mental, physical, and emotional benefits of Chang Moo Kwan. The 1950s saw an explosion of dojangs, demonstrations, and recognition. A picture showing the Participants in the 13th regular promotion test. The picture was taken in 1953. In the mid 1955 several Korean martial arts masters got together and unified several different \\"kwans\\" or schools under the common name \\"The Art of the China Hand\\" which a few years later became Tae Kwon Do, the \\"art of kicking and punching.\\" At this point Nam Suk Lee's Chang Moo Kwan was frequently referred to as Tae Kwon Do, and may very well have begun to lose some of its uniqueness. In September 1961 the Korean Tae Kwon Do Association was formed (KTA). Nam Suk Lee was appointed to the Chair of General Director to the KTA in 1961; however, in January 1962 he resigned. In 1965 the KTA was reorganized by the Korean government, and by original design, it would allow each school or \\"kwan\\" to maintain some control over their individualism, including technique, philosophies, and forms. Wiedenman maintains \\"I don't think Grandmaster Nam Suk Lee was entirely comfortable with watering down anything with his homespun traditional art.\\" Nam Suk Lee rejoined the newly reformed Korean Tae Kwon Do Association by serving as its General Director in 1967 and then Vice President in January 1969; moreover, he was reappointed to this post in 1971. May 28, 1973 marked the formation of the World Tae Kwon Do Association (WTF). Nam Suk Lee was appointed as an Executive Council Member of the WTF in 1973, concurrently he was appointed as the Vice Chairman Council of Techniques by the KTA. During the early 1970s Nam Suk Lee traveled extensively visiting Chang Moo Kwan studios both in Korea and outside Korea. At its pinnacle, 1976, the distribution of Chang Moo Kwan was made up of about 900 studios or dojangs, and almost 400 of them were overseas. During the late 1960s and early 1970s Nam Suk Lee entertained visitors from all over the world as he traveled globally to many countries including Germany, Brazil, Venezuela, and extensively in the United States. The \\"Green Book\\", as it is nicknamed, is a yearbook of sorts titled \\"On the Occasion of the 30th Anniversary of founding (Sept 1 1946-Sept 1 1976).\\" It is a snapshot of \\"the way things were at Chang Moo Kwan's apex.\\" It contains a directory of studios across the United States and world including Australia, Canada, Central America, South America, The Caribbean, Europe, and the Middle and Far East. Chang Moo Kwan's Revival Nam Suk Lee training with students Jon Wiedenman and George Fullerton. In the mid 1980s Nam Suk Lee joined the rest of his family, four sons and one daughter, settling in the USA in Southern California in the seaside community of San Pedro. In 1997, Nam Suk Lee met up with three traditional Chang Moo Kwan instructors Jon Wiedenman, George Fullerton, Tony Barnes. All three had trained for a quarter century each in Traditional Chang Moo Kwan. Wiedenman first asked if Lee could attend one of Wiedenman's black belt promotion tests. Lee agreed to do so. Next, Wiedenman asked Lee to visit his adult class at the San Pedro YMCA. Lee obliged. Seizing the opportunity, Lee stood up in the middle of class, walked to the front and began teaching. Wiedenman's students were overwhelmed. Immediately after class Wiedenman and Fullerton pleaded with Lee to teach them on a regular basis. Having not instructed in over 30 years, and now in his early 70s, Nam Suk Lee was reluctant at first. Lee told Wiedenman and Fullerton that he had not trained in a long time and had no uniform or belt. Wiedenman and Fullerton bought him a uniform, had the Korean and American flag sewn on it, and even presented him with and custom embroidered belt. Lee agreed to teach Wiedenman privately, every week, and an adult class every two weeks. Jon Wiedenman interviews Grandmaster Nam Suk Lee in March of the year 2000. At that point in time Wiedenman and Fullerton made an agreement with Lee that they would embrace whatever Lee had to offer. This was no small promise, as both Wiedenman and Fullerton had a total of almost 200 students and 40 black belts. All of the students were asked to adopt Lee's teaching and traditions. The students excitedly embraced this change. Wiedenman had told Lee that he and his students would \\"empty their cups\\" and unconditionally accept his teachings. Lee now had his first dojang in many, many years. Wiedenman and Fullerton urged Lee to simply teach them the roots of Chang Moo Kwan which he wanted to prevail over time. Until his death, Nam Suk Lee worked diligently with Wiedenman and Fullerton. During this time, Nam Suk Lee was able to present many forms, fighting techniques, and one-steps which were the foundation of traditional Chang Moo Kwan. Wiedenman noted, \\"It was a very great relationship. He passed on what he felt was important of his beloved art of Chang Moo Kwan. We respectfully followed his lead without question.\\" What was in it for Lee was the dignity and satisfaction of passing on his art to a group who appreciated and cherished it. Lee trained in the art he founded and love until four days before he fell ill. Chang Moo Kwan's inception was in 1946 at the Seoul, Korea YMCA came full circle, rekindling at the YMCA in Lee's hometown of San Pedro, regenerated and stronger than ever before. Nam Suk Lee trains with Jon Wiedenman and George V. Fullerton in the summer of 1998. Wiedenman spent a considerable about of non-training time with Nam Suk Lee in which the redesigned the logo to his satisfaction and solidified some of the traditional Chang Moo Kwan philosophy. Wiedenman videotaped many classes and a few interviews. These may be the only tapes of Nam Suk Lee that exist today. In one interview, Nam Suk Lee reaffirmed his desire for a revival of Traditional Chang Moo Kwan and the desire for it to be its own entity and not to be a part of any outside organization. When Wiedenman asked Lee what he most wanted students and instructors to keep in the forefront of their minds when training, \\"cultivate capability\\" is simply what Lee said. Nam Suk Lee died in his sleep August 29, 2000. He suffered a massive stroke after a relatively routine surgery earlier that year in May of that year. Upon his death, Wiedenman, as his last and highest ranking student, declared his teacher \\"Supreme Grandmaster\\" and awarded him his 10th Dan Black Belt. Wiedenman and the handful of instructors who trained with Nam Suk Lee still carry out traditional classes at several locations in Southern California and Arizona. George Fullerton, Tony Barnes, David Johns, Rome Saura, Wilson Wong, Cosmo Magiliozzi, and Darrell Cook are a few of his students still actively carrying on Nam Suk Lee's traditional teachings and forms.

It creates a three-dimensional planetarium representing the entire universe from a combination of real astronomical data and scientifically-accurate procedural generation algorithms. Users can travel through space in any direction or speed, and forwards or backwards in time. SpaceEngine is in beta status and is currently freeware for Microsoft Windows. SpaceEngine's latest release, version 0.990 beta, is the first paid edition (released on Steam). Properties of objects, such as temperature, mass, radius, spectrum, etc., are presented to the user on the HUD and in an accessible information window. Users can observe celestial objects ranging from small asteroids or moons to large galaxy clusters, similar to other simulators such as Celestia. The default version of SpaceEngine includes over 130,000 real objects, including stars from the Hipparcos catalog, galaxies from the NGC and IC catalogs, many well- known nebulae, and all known exoplanets and their stars. Functionality The UI of SpaceEngine, showing a procedural earth analog with planetary rings. The proclaimed goal of SpaceEngine is scientific realism, and to reproduce every type of known astronomical phenomenon. It uses star catalogs along with procedural generation to create a cubical universe 10 billion parsecs (32.6 billion light-years) on each side, centered on the Solar System barycenter. = Catalog objects = The real objects that SpaceEngine includes are the Hipparcos catalog for stars, the NGC and IC catalogs for galaxies, all known exoplanets, and prominent star clusters, nebulae, and Solar System objects. =Wiki and locations= The software has its own built-in \\"wiki\\" database which gives detailed information on all celestial objects and enables a player to create custom names and descriptions for them. It also has a locations database where a player can save any position and time in the simulation and load it again in the future.  Limitations  Although objects that form part of a planetary system move, and stars rotate about their axes and orbit each other in multiple star systems, stellar proper motion is not simulated, and galaxies are at fixed locations and do not rotate. Most real-world spacecraft such as Voyager 2 are not provided with SpaceEngine. Interstellar light absorption is not modeled in SpaceEngine. Development Development of SpaceEngine began in 2005, with its first public release in June 2010. The software is written in C++. The engine uses OpenGL as its graphical API and uses shaders written in GLSL. As of the release of version 0.990, the shaders have been encrypted to protect against plagiarism. Plans have been made to start opening them in a way that allows the community to develop special content for the game, with ship engine effects being made available to users who have purchased the game. On May 27, 2019, the Steam store page for SpaceEngine was made public in preparation for the release of the first paid version, 0.990 beta. SpaceEngine is currently only available for Windows PCs; however, Romanyuk has plans for the software to support macOS and Linux in the future.  Space Engine Archive Project  Teaser of the Space Engine Archive Project A project carried out by a member of the community called Space Engine Archive Project, offers the community a web application to archive their discoveries in order to keep in memory all the celestial bodies that have one day been discovered by the community. Moreover, it is the first digital tool using directly the sharing system via the generation of URLs in the game.

History On February 26, 1993, after spending at least six years as musical director of Maravilla de Florida, pianist Manolito Simonet departed along with most of the group's members, added a horn section, synthesizer and kick drum, and started playing timba under the name Manolito y su Trabuco.Moore, Kevin (2013: web) \\"Manolito y su Trabuco\\" Timba.com. Trabuco literally means a firearm from the times of the Independence War of 1895 and figuratively refers to anything forceful or strong (Vaughan 2012: Kindle 345). In 1996 United States based Bembe Records released Manolito's first CD Directo al coraz√≥n in North America. This was the first of Bembe's \\"Salsa cubana\\" series, an attempt to market the new Cuban popular music as salsa. For the most part however, acceptance of timba in the salsa market has been limited. In 1997, during the height of timba's popularity, the Buena Vista Social Club released its first CD. In response to that record's international success, older-style Cuban music became quite popular. There is little evidence that the BVSC's success affected the sale of timba records though. Because of the band's arrangements, Manolito y su Trabuco is one of the few timba bands that has experienced noteworthy cross-over into the salsa market. Manolito's exceptionally creative use of multiple contrapuntal mo√±as (horn guajeos) is a rarity in timba, but common in salsa. Manolito y su Trabuco's front line has included some of the best singers of the era, including Rosendo \\"El Gallo\\" D√≠az, Sixto \\"El Indio\\" Llorente, and Carlos Kalunga. Manolito's 1990s recordings feature one of the most renowned synthesizer players, Osiris Mart√≠nez, and the prolific composer, singer Ricardo Amaray. El Trabuco is one of the largest timba bands, a \\"super-charang√≥n,\\" as it is called, with violin, cello, two trumpets, two trombones, flute, and synthesizer, as well as the standard piano, bass, drums, congas and g√ºiro. Many of Trabuco's biggest hits result from Amaray's R&B; influences, filtered through Simonet's strong Cuban aesthetic and arranging abilities. Like Issac Delgado, Manolito made CDs that mixed the aggressive hardcore timba he played in concert with various other styles designed to appeal to foreign buyers. For example, he has recorded cumbias in an effort to target Mexican and South American audiences.Moore (2010: v. 5: 22) Discography * (1993) Directo al coraz√≥n. * (1996) Contra todos los progn√≥sticos. * Concierto Eurotropical. * (1998) Marcando La Distancia. * (2000) Para que baile en Cuba. * (2001) Se rompieron los term√≥metros. * (2004) Locos por mi Habana. * (2007) Hablando en serio. * (2008) Control. * (2010) Trabuco una vez m√°s. * (2013) Sin freno. * (2015) No Puedo Parar. * (2017) Nueva Estrellas de Areito. * (2018) A Puro Coraz√≥n.

The Arch of Hadrian is an ancient Roman structure in Jerash, Jordan. It is an 11-metre high triple-arched gateway erected to honor the visit of Roman Emperor Hadrian to the city (then called Gerasa) in the winter of 129‚Äì130. The arch originally stood to almost 22 m and probably had wooden doors. It features some unconventional, possibly Nabataean, architectural features, such as acanthus bases. The columns are decorated with capitals at the bottom rather than the top. The monument served both as a commemorative arch and as an approach to Gerasa. The Arch's relative remoteness from the city walls points to a plan for southward expansion of Gerasa during its heyday. The expansion, however, has not been implemented.  Description  In 2005, the arch was under restoration. Reconstruction was completed in 2007 and the arch is now roughly 21 meters high (about 36 feet), 37.45 meters long, and 9.25 meters wide. Each face of the arch has four engaged columns standing on pedestals and bases. Each pedestal is 2.20 meters high, 2.25 meters wide and 1.20 meters deep. The base of each column is topped by a row of acanthus leaves. There are three vaulted passageways on the lower level and each of these is flanked by two columns with Corinthian capitals. The two flanked archways are topped with niches. Each niche is on top of a small entablature, which stands on two pilasters crowned with capitals. The arch was crowned with an attic, which might have held a dedicatory inscription. The lower part of the attic was decorated with a frieze of acanthus leaves and the central part was crowned with a triangular cornice.  Inscription  There was a marble tabula ansata panel that was 1.03 meters in height and 7.14 meters in width, with letters 12‚Äì13 cm tall.
