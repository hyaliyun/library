In 1184, the Templars' headquarters was transferred to the New Temple (Temple Church) in London where once again they built a round church, this one patterned after the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. It was consecrated in 1185, and became the location for initiation rituals.Lost Worlds: Knights Templar, July 10, 2006, History Channel video documentary 1185 Hospital for Knights Templars In 1185 a hospital granted to the Knights Templars, for the use of sick persons, was this year founded at Newark, Nottinghamshire. An inventory by Geoffrey Fitz Stephen reveals that by 1185, the Order of the Knights Templar had extensive holdings in London, Hertfordshire, Essex, Kent, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, Salop, Oxfordshire, Cornwall, Lincolnshire and Yorkshire. The involvement of Templars in financial matters is highlighted by Walter of Coventry's story of Gilbert de Ogrestan, the Knight Templar accused of embezzling taxes collected in the Saladin tithe of 1188. He was severely punished by his contemporary Master. In 1200, Pope Innocent III issued a Papal Bull declaring the immunity of persons and goods within the houses of the Knights Templar from local laws. This ensured that the New Temple became a royal treasury as well as the repository for the order's accumulated revenues. These financial resources provided the basis for the development of the Templar's local banking facilities. King Richard I (1189‚Äì1199) confirmed the Templars' land holdings and granted them immunity from all pleas, suits danegeld and from murdrum and latrocinium. King John (1199‚Äì1216) had substantial financial dealings with the Knights Templar. At the time of Runnymede, not only was Aymeric de St Maur present, but King John was also resident at the Temple when the Barons first presented their demands. He awarded them the island of Lundy as well as land at Huntspill, Cameley, Harewood, Radnage and Northampton. King Henry III (1207‚Äì1272) also had substantial dealing with Templars, the king's Wardrobe being located there in 1225. He entrusted Templar knights with military, financial and diplomatic commissions, and even considered being buried in the Temple. He did in fact establish a chantry there in 1231. The first Templar House in England was in London. Early patrons included Robert de Ferrers, 2nd Earl of Derby, Bernard de Balliol, King Stephen of England and Queen Matilda. Persecution and dissolution Templars being burned at the stake King Edward I (1239‚Äì1307) had accorded the Knights Templar a slighter role in public affairs, financial issues often being handled by Italian merchants and diplomacy by mendicant orders. Indeed, Edward I raided the treasury in 1283. When Philip IV, King of France suppressed the order in 1307, King Edward II of England at first refused to believe the accusations. But after the intercession of Pope Clement V, King Edward ordered the seizure of members of the order in England on 8 January 1308. Only handfuls of Templars were duly arrested, however. Their trial ran from 22 October 1309 until 18 March 1310 in front of Deodatus, Abbot of Lagny and Sicard de Vaur. Most of the Templars acknowledged their belief that the Order's Master could give absolution was heretical, and were then reconciled with the church. However, Willian de la More refused to do so and remained a prisoner in the Tower of London until his death. In 1312, under further pressure from King Philip IV of France, Pope Clement V officially disbanded the Order at the Council of Vienne. In 1314, the remaining Templar leaders in France were executed, some by being burned at the stake. Clement issued a Papal Bull which granted the lands of the Templars to the Knights Hospitaller, but this was ignored until 1324. Starting in 1347, the priests started letting (renting) part of the Temple to lawyers, from which the evolution of the Inner Temple and Middle Temple as Inns of Court derives. Templar Survival in England Between 13 October 1307 and 8 January 1308, the Templars went unmolested in England. During this period many fugitive Templars, seeking to escape torture and execution, fled to apparent safety there. But after repeated pressure from Philip IV and Clement V on Edward II, a few half-hearted arrests were made. During a trial running from 22 October 1309 until 18 March 1310 most of the arrested Templars were forced to acknowledge the belief that the Order's Master could give absolution was heretical, and were officially reconciled with the church, many entering more conventional monastic Orders. Most Templars in England were never arrested, and the persecution of their leaders was brief. The order was dissolved due to damaged reputation, but given the pope and church's judgement of the order as free from guilt, all members in England were free to find themselves a new place in society. Templar lands and assets were given to the Order of the Hospital of Saint John, a sister military order‚Äîthough the English crown held onto some assets until 1338. The largest portion of former Templars joined the Hospitallers, while other remaining members joined the Cistercian order, or lived on pension as lay members of society. The loss of the Holy Land as a base for war against the muslims had removed the primary reason for Templar existence, and the dissolved order now faded into history, in England as well as the rest of Europe. The Templars in Hertfordshire Baldock in Hertfordshire was a town founded by the Knights Templar and between 1199 and 1254 it was their English headquarters. The Hertford Mercury newspaper reported a warren of Templar tunnels beneath the town of Hertford, centering on Hertford Castle, where in 1309 four Templars from Temple Dinsley near Hitchin were imprisoned after their arrest by Edward II, who believed that they were holding a lost treasure. =Royston Cave in Hertfordshire= St Catherine & Christ carved in Royston Cave by 'fugitive Templars' Modern tradition has it that after the persecution began the Templars were forced to meet in caves, tunnels and cellars in Hertfordshire and elsewhere in southeast England. However, the brief and modest persecution in England is unlikely to have necessitated this, as remaining members could, even around 1310, met at the house or room of a friend not under arrest‚Äîwhich would have been most Templars. But after lying undiscovered for at least 300 years, workmen accidentally stumbled upon Royston Cave (August 1742), hidden under a heavy millstone and a covering of soil. The cave's discovery created much excitement. Today, it still awes and inspires visitors who can see carvings depicting, among other images, knights, Saint George and Saint Catherine of Alexandria. Before the brief persecution, the Templars, assuming the cave was theirs, had no reason to hide below the ground, and they had wealth and access to stonemasons if they required religious carvings. It is thus suggested by storytellers and a few historians that Royston Cave is evidence 'fugitive' Templars continued to meet and worship in secret after the disbandment. There have been some highly questionable claims made about Royston Cave and its history, including the suggestion that its Templar builders may, in effect, have been early Freemasons. However, no evidence of this link has been produced at this time. The Templars in Rochester Much of Strood, Kent was a royal manor until Henry II gave it to the Knights Templar around 1159. The Templars had assembled a range of buildings in Strood by 1185, which included a timber hall, barns, kitchens and stables. The stone building, which has survived to the present day, was added around 1240. It consists of a vaulted undercroft supporting a large, undivided first-floor hall, approached by an external staircase. This was probably a part of the range of facilities designed for the temporary accommodation of travelling Templar dignitaries. Over the years, this hall was altered and enlarged as it passed through the hands of a number of owners. Many additions have been lost but two fine, 17th century brick extensions can still be seen today. These and the massive internal chimney were built by the Blake family, perhaps the richest in Strood at that time. The estate was inevitably sold off bit by bit until the City of Rochester acquired what was left and decided to use the site for industrial development. The debate over the future of the house was interrupted by a gentleman named Mr. Willis (a local councillor) in 1913 just 2 weeks after purchasing an 8.4 acre (3.4 hectare) plot of land directly East across the River Medway for a facility of what was to become known as the Seaplane Works. It was not until 1951 that work began to save the building and preserve it in the condition in which it can be seen today. Templar legacy Nearly any site in England which uses the name \\"Temple,\\" can probably be traced to Templar origins. The Temple Church still stands on the site of the old Preceptory in London, and effigies of Crusading Templars can still be seen there today. The land was later rented to lawyers who use it today as Inner Temple and Middle Temple. Modern Templar organisations in England Several modern organisations claim links with the medieval Templars. Some, such as the Sovereign Military Order of the Temple of Jerusalem (SMOTJ), also known as the \\"Ordo Supremus Militaris Templi Hierosolymitani\\" (OSMTH), have attained United Nations NGO (Non-Governmental Organisation) status. The SMOTJ admits that their group was founded in 1804, \\"based on the traditions\\" of the medieval order, which legacy they use to promote humanitarian causes.OSMTH website: \\"The Order of the Temple is a Christian ecumenical organisation founded in 1804 by the physician Fabr√©-Palaprat with the support of Napoleon, and officially recognised in 1853 by Napoleon III. The Order operates on the basis of the traditions of the medieval Knights Templar. It reclaims the spirit of, but does not assert any direct descent from the ancient Order founded by Hugues de Payens in 1118 and dissolved by Pope Clement V in 1312.\\" However, there is often public confusion about the gap in time between the 14th century dismantling of the medieval Templars, and the 19th century rise of more contemporary organisations. According to a 2004 article in The Times, one modern group in Hertfordshire (not affiliated to OSMTH) claims that although the medieval order officially ceased to exist in the early 14th century, that the majority of the organisation survived underground. The Times article states that the group has written to the Vatican, asking for an official apology for the medieval persecution of the Templars. In Rome in 2004, a Vatican spokesman said that the demand for an apology would be given \\"serious consideration\\". However, Vatican insiders said that Pope John Paul II, 84 at the time, was under pressure from conservative cardinals to \\"stop saying sorry\\" for the errors of the past, after a series of papal apologies for the Crusades, the Inquisition, Christian anti-Semitism and the persecution of scientists and \\"heretics\\" such as Galileo.\\"The Last Crusade of the Templars\\", November 29, 2004, The Times Templar locations in England =Churches= Marble effigies of medieval knights in the Temple Church. * Bisham Abbey, Berkshire * All Saints Church, Claverley, Shropshire * Temple Church, Bristol * Temple Church, London * The Holy Sepulchre, Cambridge, Cambridgeshire (The Round Church in Cambridge) * Garway Church, Herefordshire (Templar church with carvings and part of original round church excavated and fully visible) * Cressing Temple, Essex * Temple Balsall & Church, Warwickshire * Temple Church, Cornwall * Temple Ewell & Church, Kent * Rothley Temple (Rothley Preceptory), Rothley, Leicestershire * St. Mary's Church, Baldock, Hertfordshire. * Shipley Church, Shipley, West Sussex * St. Mary's House, Bramber, West Sussex * St. Mary's church, Sompting, West Sussex * Poling Church, Poling, West Sussex * Templar Church, Dover, on the Dover Western Heights, discovered in 1806 during construction of the fortifications there, according to Matthew Paris the site of King John's submission to the papal legate Pandulph in May 1213 =Place names= * Temple Bruer, Lincolnshire, village and Templar ruins * Temple Dinsley, Hertfordshire (now the village of Preston) * Templecombe, near Sherborne * Temple Mills (a post-industrial part of Stratford, London, incorporated into the 2012 Summer Olympics * Bristol City centre is rich in Templar place names and history such as Bristol Temple Meads railway station, Temple Bridge, Temple Gate, Temple Street... * Temple Cloud, Somerset * Temple Newsam, Leeds * Temple Sowerby, Cumbria * Temple Hirst, Yorkshire =Other locations= * Royston Cave, Hertfordshire.

At its peak, DNSChanger was estimated to have infected over four million computers, bringing in at least US$14 million in profits to its operator from fraudulent advertising revenue. Both Windows and Mac OS X variants of DNSChanger were circulated, the latter taking the form of a related Trojan known as RSPlug. The FBI raided the malicious servers on November 8, 2011, but they kept the servers up after they captured it to avoid affected users from losing Internet access until July 9, 2012. Operation DNSChanger was distributed as a drive-by download claiming to be a video codec needed to view content on a Web site, particularly appearing on rogue pornography sites. Once installed, the malware then modified the system's Domain Name System (DNS) configuration, pointing them to rogue name servers operated through affiliates of Rove Digital. These rogue name servers primarily substituted advertising on Web pages with advertising sold by Rove. Additionally, the rogue DNS server redirected links to certain Web sites to those of advertisers, such as for example, redirecting the IRS Web site to that of a tax preparation company. The effects of DNSChanger could also spread itself to other computers within a LAN by mimicking a DHCP server, pointing other computers toward the rogue DNS servers. In its indictment against Rove, the United States Department of Justice also reported that the rogue servers had blocked access to update servers for antivirus software. Shutdown and interim DNS servers On October 1, 2011, as part of Operation Ghost Click (a collaborative investigation into the operation), the United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York announced charges against six Estonian nationals and one Russian national connected to DNSChanger and Rove Digital for wire fraud, computer intrusion, and conspiracy. Arrests were made by Estonian authorities, and servers connected to the malware located in the United States were seized by the FBI. Due to concerns by FBI agents that users still infected by DNSChanger could lose Internet access if the rogue DNS servers were shut down entirely, a temporary court order was obtained to allow the Internet Systems Consortium to operate replacement servers, which would serve DNS requests from those who had not yet removed the infection, and to collect information on those still infected in order to promptly notify them about the presence of the malware. While the court order was set to expire on March 8, 2012, an extension was granted until July 9, 2012 due to concerns that there were still many infected computers. F-Secure estimated on July 4, 2012 that at least 300,000 computers were still infected with the DNSChanger malware, 70,000 of which were located in the United States. The interim DNS servers were officially shut down by the FBI on July 9, 2012. Impact from the shutdown was considered to be minimal, due in part to major Internet service providers providing temporary DNS services of their own and support to customers affected by DNSChanger. and informational campaigns surrounding the malware and the impending shutdown. These included online tools that could check for the presence of DNSChanger, while Google and Facebook provided notifications to visitors of their respective services who were still affected by the malware. By July 9, 2012, F-Secure estimated that the number of remaining DNSChanger infections in the U.S. had dropped from 70,000 to 42,000.

It was formerly also known as √éle Marchand and Madison Island. Herman Melville wrote his book Typee based on his experiences in the Taipivai valley in the eastern part of Nuku Hiva. Robert Louis Stevenson's first landfall on his voyage on the Casco was at Hatihe'u, on the north side of the island, in 1888.  Geography  =Coast= Western Nuku Hiva is characterized by a steep but fairly regular coastline, indented occasionally by small bays leading to deep valleys, which lead into the interior. There are no villages on this side. The coastline of the eastern part of the island has few places to land by sea and takes the brunt of the ocean swells. The north, on the other hand, is indented by deep bays, the largest of which are Anah≈ç and Hatihe'u. 'A'akapa bay is not as large but has a village of the same name. The south has fewer bays, among which those of Taioha'e, Taipivai, Ho'oumi, Hakaui (the last three are parts of the larger Baie du Contr√¥leur), and the bays of Hakau'i and Hakatea, both accessed by the same narrow entrance. =Inland= The central part of the island is a high plateau called To'ovi'i, covered primarily by a tall-grass prairie, on which experiments in cattle raising are taking place for the first time ‚Äî 15 years ago all the cattle were feral and hunted with rifles. On the western edge of To'ovi'i rises Tekao, the island's highest peak, which reaches an elevation of 1224 m (4,016 ft). The western and northern edges of To'ovi'i are a mountain ridge, which catches much of the rain that waters the island. Pine forest plantations covering large areas all around the crater of To'ovi'i give an overall impression of the lower Alps and parts of Germany, Wales and Switzerland. In one place, Vaip≈ç Waterfall, the collected water falls off a highland and falls 350 m (1,148 ft). The slopes of the north western side of the island are much drier than the rest of the island, and are often described as a desert named Te Henua a Taha or \\"Terre D√©serte\\" in French.  Administration  Nuku Hiva is administratively part of the commune (municipality) of Nuku-Hiva, itself in the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands. The administrative centre of the commune of Nuku-Hiva and also of the administrative subdivision of the Marquesas Islands is the settlement of Taioha'e, located on the south side of Nuku Hiva, at the head of the bay of that same name.  Demographics  Demographic evolution of Nuku Hiva since 1971 The population in 2007 was 2,660. This is substantially less than that encountered at the end of the 16th century when the Spaniards first sighted the island. Contacts with Europeans may have brought new world infections such as venereal disease and influenza causing high mortality. Historical sources are sparse and it is unclear when various diseases commonly seen in the New World, Europe and Asia first appeared in Nuku Hiva. The population has increased to 3210 by 2017. The population is primarily Polynesian with a small proportion of Europeans, mostly from Metropolitan France. At the 2002 census, 92.6% of Nuku Hiva's residents were born in French Polynesia while 148 people, making up 5.6% of Nuku Hiva's residents, were people born in Metropolitan France.R√©partition de la population de la Polyn√©sie fran√ßaise par √Æle en 2017, Institut de la statistique de la Polyn√©sie fran√ßaise (ISPF), consult√© le 27 f√©vrier 2019. Life The primary diet of people tends to be breadfruit, taro, manioc, coconut and many kinds of fruit, which grow in abundance. Goats, fish and, more rarely, pigs, are the main sources of meat but there is a growing amount of local beef available. Imported food is also freely available, including apples, grapes, celery, and even sliced bread from New Zealand. Two local bakeries produce baguettes, another cheap staple. Considerable rice is also eaten. There are a great many wild pigs on the island as well as those reared on the agricultural college. The wild pigs are a cross between the Polynesian pig brought by the first settlers and the wild boar brought by the Europeans. There is one jail on the island, which was generally used for 'short stay' internments such as the last 3 months of sentences and was also often altogether empty. Lately, however, prisoners can opt to do their full sentence here if they have no family on Tahiti, so the Nuku Hiva jail now has inmates all the time.  Transportation  Nuku Hiva is served by a single-runway airport in the northwest corner of the island, approximately by road, northwest of Taioha'e. The airport was opened on December 14, 1980. History =Ancient Period= A lithograph from 1846 titled \\"Cases de naturels √† Nouka-Hiva\\".From Jules Dumont d'Urville, Voyage au P√¥le Sud et dans l'Oc√©anie sur les corvettes L'Astrolabe et La Z√©l√©e, (Gide Paris), 1846. Nuku Hiva was, in ancient times, the site of two provinces, Te I'i covering somewhat more than the western two thirds of the island, and Tai Pƒ´, covering the eastern third. Latest studies indicate that the first people to arrive here came from west Polynesia around 2000 years ago, only later colonizing Tahiti, Hawai'i, The Cook Islands and New Zealand. The legend has it that 'Ono, the god of creation, promised his wife to build a house in one day, so he gathered together land and created these islands, which are all named after parts of the house, Nuku Hiva being the roof. Everything he had left over he threw to one side and created a dump which is called 'Ua Huka. From these supposed origins the population rose to an untenable size; first European estimates vary from 50,000 to 100,000. Food became of prime importance. Breadfruit was the staple, but taro, plantain and manioc also played a big part. As for meat, fish was the main source, but even so was limited because of the quantity needed to feed so many mouths. Pigs, chickens and dogs were also cultivated, and hunted when they took to the wild. It is still debated why many Polynesian tribes or nations practiced cannibalism. Indeed, a large number of Pacific Islands residents did so in pre-historic times. One theory is that cannibalism was more for food than ritual, although ritual played a big part. An offering to the gods was called Ika, which means fish, and a sacrifice was caught and, just like a fish, was hung by a fishhook in the sacred place. Those to be eaten were tied and hung up in trees until needed, then had their brains bashed out on execution blocks with a club. Women and children seem to have been cannibalized just for food, whereas warriors killed in battle were offerings to the gods and were eaten by their conquerors to absorb their power; their skulls were kept by their slayers for the same reason. =Post-contact Period= European exploration and whaling On July 21, 1595 √Ålvaro de Menda√±a de Neira stopped at Fatu Iva and called the islands Los Marquesas after the wife of the Viceroy of Peru. James Cook likewise visited the south in 1774, and the Solide expedition in 1791. There is little evidence that these visits led to the introduction of diseases, perhaps because slow passages inhibited the diseases aboard the ships. It seems that it was the commercial shipping, taking on sandalwood, and the whaling ships that brought the epidemics that killed nine out of ten Polynesians. The Marquesas was a port of call for foreign whaleships. This happened because the females were so friendly, they would swim out to meet the ships. There is no known case of rape against any Marquesan female, though the opposite was never reported. The great decline in population was after the doctors left because whaling declined. There was nobody to treat the infected natives. Nuku Hiva Campaign The American fleet at Nuka Hiva in 1813. During the wars between the Te I'i and the Tai Pƒ´, on October 25, 1813, the American Captain David Porter arrived in the frigate USS Essex, the flagship of his fleet of ten other armed ships. A shore party was landed and they claimed the island for the United States and constructed a small village, named Madisonville. A fortification, named Fort Madison, and a dock were also built, the latter to refit the Essex. Almost immediately Porter became involved in the tribal conflict.War of 1812: Commodore David Porter and the Essex in the South Pacific The first expedition into the jungle was led by Lieutenant John Downes. He and forty others, with the assistance of several hundred Te I'is, captured a fort held by 3,000 to 4,000 Happah warriors. The victory forced the Happah to terms and they allied themselves with both the Americans and the Te I'i. Porter himself led a second expedition in which he made an amphibious assault against the Tai Pƒ´ held coastline. Five thousand Te I'is and Happahs accompanied the fleet in at least 200 war-canoes. The landing was unopposed. Porter's force of thirty men and a cannon led the march inland where they found another, more formidable, enemy fort. The thousands of natives, armed with rocks and spears but positioned in a formidable mountain fortress, were able to fend off their attackers. The victory was short-lived however and Captain Porter followed up his landing with an expedition overland, bypassing the fort, to threaten the Tai Pƒ´'s village center in Typee Valley as the Americans named it. A warrior of Nuku Hiva with a spear and a hand fan by Wilhelm Gottlieb Tilesius von Tilenau, 1813. The column arrived at their destination on 30 November 1813. The first shots fired occurred after the Tai Pƒ´'s attempted to ambush the column; the attack was beaten off. Porter issued a message warning that if the Tai Pƒ´ did not cease their resistance at once, he would destroy the villages. After a little while of waiting, the hostiles seemed to ignore the demands so the expedition advanced. An engagement ensued as the villages were burned. In the end, the Americans and their Te I'i and Happah allies had won at severe cost to the enemy, who sued for peace soon after. The next few months were peaceful until May 1814. The War of 1812 between the United States and the United Kingdom was in its third year and most of the American fleet was captured British privateers. At least six British prisoners were at Nuku Hiva during the American operations against the natives, not including a number who volunteered to fight for Captain Porter. In December 1813, Porter left Nuku Hiva to continue raiding British whalers. He left behind only nineteen navy sailors and six prisoners under two midshipmen and United States Marine Corps Lieutenant John M. Gamble. On May 7, 1814, a group of the British sailors mutinied, released the six prisoners, and attacked the fort. Gamble was wounded in the foot and taken captive with his remaining men on the converted whaler Seringapatam though the Americans were set adrift later that day. Another version, told in the book \\"The Washington Islands\\" and given by the head archeologist of French Polynesia, is that Porter and his fleet of three ships (including two captured British ships) came to Taioha'e and made a prison there. Porter sent some of his cannons overland, and took three days to get to Taipivai. He also then had his ships go into Taipivai harbor. Porter called it a great victory even though the villagers simply left; the chief thought Porter was insane. Porter went back to Taioha'e where he had a prison set up for the British sailors. Porter's men became lax because they were more interested in the village women, enabling the British sailors to break out and make the Americans prisoners. Soon the British in turn became lax, and the Americans broke out of the prison and made the British prisoners. The chief had had enough of this \\"civilized\\" behavior and told Porter to \\"Get out\\". Porter left. The Americans used an Englishman named Wilson, who lived on the island, as an interpreter; on May 9 he convinced the Te I'i that Porter would not return from his raid, which the natives were not happy about. Wilson eventually persuaded the Te I'is to cancel the alliance and attack. Six American sailors were on the beach at Madisonville at the time, four of the men were killed and one other man escaped wounded with a second survivor. Gamble was alone on , one of the captured British ships. While he was still recovering from the wound to his foot, two Te I'i war-canoes attacked the ship. The ship's cannon were already loaded, so Lieutenant Gamble stumbled from one gun to another, firing them as fast as he could. Ultimately Gamble beat off the enemy attack single-handedly, but, after the deaths of four of his men in town, there was no choice but to abandon the colony with the remaining seven men, all of whom were either wounded or ill. After that the base was never again occupied by American forces. Captain Porter, who intended to sail back to Nuka Hiva, was captured at the Battle of Valpara√≠so on March 28. Meanwhile unknown to Porter on 28 August 1814, a Royal Navy flotilla with HMS Briton anchored off Nuku Hiva. They found that Porter had built Fort Madison, Nuku Hiva and a villa on the island, which the natives destroyed after his ship left. Before his departure, Thomas Staines, with the consent of the local tribes excepting the \\"Typees\\" from the Tai Pi Valley, took possession of Nuku Hiva on behalf of the British Crown.Shillibeer, p.74 When Porter got back to the US, he went in front of the United States Congress and proudly told Congress that he claimed the Washington Islands as American. Congress was aghast that American sailors would cohabitate with the islanders, leading Congress to decline Porter's claim. Congress didn't want the \\"shame\\" that American sailors would act like that. Some years later Porter became chief of Mexico's navy. In 1842 France took possession of the whole group and established a settlement that was abandoned in 1859.Boot, pg. 31-37 =19th and 20th Centuries= A ship from Peru captured people from 'Ua Pou and took them back as slaves (see Blackbirding), but as the Catholic Church had converted the islands to Christianity by then, there was a protest and those captives who were still alive were sent back. However, this was a mixed blessing because they brought typhoid fever. A population in excess of 100,000 in 1820 fell to 6,000 in 1872, to 3,000 in 1911 and to a low point of 2,200 in 1927. It seemed that there was no way the Marquesans would survive, but two French doctors toured the islands giving vaccinations and medical care and halted the heavy death toll. Leprosy, however, was still a problem only 20 years ago and elephantiasis is only now almost gone. Due to its isolation from Tahiti and the will of most of the population, it has been spared the fate of its capital and remains a mysterious undeveloped archipelago. =21st Century= In 2002, France successfully requested that a 20-year moratorium be applied to French Polynesia to stop it from being incorporated into the European Union. One of the driving factors was to stop non-French investment in property for the time being. The then-mayor of Nuku Hiva, Lucien Kimitete, who promoted separation of the Marquesas Islands from French Polynesia within the French Republic, was killed in an airplane accident in May 2002, along with MP Boris Leontieff, Mayor of Arue in Tahiti. Many locals still believe this crash was not properly investigated. There is a considerable amount of latent resentment and hostility about this. Since the death of Kimitete, Marquesan political leaders have repeatedly declared themselves in favor of separating from French Polynesia and remaining within the French Republic in case French Polynesian political leaders in Tahiti would proclaim the independence of French Polynesia.Pol√©mique √† Tahiti: les Marquises veulent se rapprocher de Paris Media use In 2001, Nuku Hiva was used as the filming location for the fourth season of the American reality competition series Survivor, airing in the United States in 2002. British explorer and presenter Ben Fogle filmed an episode of Ben Fogle: New Lives in the Wild in 2015 with a nomadic couple who reside on a boat, which was moored off Nuku Hiva at the time of his week-long visit. They sailed from the south west to the north east.http://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the- wild/episodes/s4-episode-4 In literature In his science fiction novel Paris in the Twentieth Century, written in 1863, Jules Verne describes Nuku Hiva as one of the main stock exchanges of the world of 1960: See also *List of volcanoes in French Polynesia References *  Further reading  *Robert Louis Stevenson, In the South Seas, Being an Account of Experiences and Observations in the Marquesas, Paumotur and Gilbert Islands in the Course of Two Cruises, on the Yacht Casco (1888) and the Schooner Equator (1898), a collection of letters published posthumously in 1896 *Herman Melville's first book, Typee, first edition 1846, documents the ways and mores of the people of Taipivai. *In Edward Everett Hale's novella \\"The Man Without a Country\\", Nolan helps Commodore Porter in the victory at Nuka Hiva (spelled Nukahiwa).

The 338th was activated 4 September 1942 at Camp Atterbury, Indiana, and moved to Camp Claiborne, Louisiana, on 15 November 1942. The regiment departed New York on 28 April 1943 (likely on the SS Santa Rosa) and arrived at Oran, Algeria, on 12 May 1943. The 338th landed in Italy on 8 February 1944. Livorno, 300 miles north of Naples on the western coast of Italy, was needed as a supply base for the North Apennines campaign, but the port was the most thoroughly demolished one in the Mediterranean. The Germans had erected barricades, blown bridges, laid mines, and sunk twenty ships to completely seal off the harbor entrances. The Allies also contributed to the destruction; in some 50 raids during the first half of 1944, they dropped more than 1,000 tons of bombs. Elements of the 34th Infantry Division (United States) captured Livorno on 19 July 1944. The 338th, which had been working on hospitals in Rome, had no experience in port repair, but drew the assignment anyway. Twelve men from the 338th Engineers arrived in the city a few hours later to clear mines from predetermined routes into the port area. Leghorn was heavily mined, and for the first few days little other than mine clearing could be accomplished. As the mine-clearing teams made room, more elements of the 338th arrived, set up quarters, and began preparing a berth for the LST and the LCT carrying construction equipment. By 26 July, both craft had unloaded. In the meantime, engineers repaired electrical lines and started to restore the municipal water system. The primary task for the 338th engineers was to reconstruct berths for ships. The 338th received planning aid from several specialists of the 1051st Engineer Port and Repair Group, representatives of the British Navy charged with clearing the waters of Leghorn harbor, and shipowners and contractors who knew the port. Within a month, berths for six Liberty ships had been completed giving Leghorn a capacity of 5,000 tons per day. The goal of 12,000 tons per day was reached by the end of September, as projected. As the berths were completed, the 338th turned its attention to rebuilding roads, bridges, hospitals, depots, and camps. Every task required extensive minesweeping. Working together with Italian soldiers and civilians, the engineers were able to amass and distribute the large volume of supplies required. Assured of a strong supply base in the rear, Fifth Army moved rapidly forward into the Po River valley. For its accomplishments, the 338th was awarded the Meritorious Service Unit Plaque per General Orders No. 66, Headquarters, Peninsular Base Section, 24 February 1945. The citation was as follows: \\"The 338th Engineer General Service Regiment, Peninsular Base Section, for superior performance of duty in the accomplishment of an exceptionally difficult mission in Italy from 17 July 1944 to 30 September 1944. This regiment entered the Port of Leghorn under artillery fire and through extensive mine fields, moved equipment over bombed out roads and bridges, cleared streets and dock areas that were completely blocked by debris from demolished buildings and other structures; removed thousands of enemy mines, built new roads and bridges, repaired utilities, and planned and constructed berthing and unloading facilities in one of the most completely destroyed ports as yet encountered in Italy. The 338th Engineer General Service Regiment by careful planning and proper organi- zation, vigorous prosecution of the work over long hours and exceptional ingenuity and engineering skill placed the Port of Leghorn in operating conditions within six (6) weeks after its capture. The accomplishments of the 338th Engineer General Service Regiment during this period are in the highest traditions of the military service\\". The 338th returned to the U.S. at Boston on the Liberty Ship SS Zebulon Pike 8 November 1945 after 2 years, 6 months, and 10 days overseas. The 338th was inactivated at Camp Myles Standish, Mass., on 9 November 1945.

Merrett was born at South Yarra in Melbourne to civil servant Samuel Headen Merrett and Sarah Ashton, n√©e Baxter. His father died in 1878 and Charles, despite being a graduate from Melbourne Grammar School, was unable to attend university and instead became an office-boy at a merchants' and manufacturer's representation firm in 1880. By 1890 he had risen to become a partner in the business; he would eventually be managing director in 1916. He married Annie Florence Slocombe on 21 April 1891. He joined the St Kilda Rifles in 1880 and transferred to the Victorian Mounted Rifles in 1883, holding the posts of lieutenant and quartermaster (1889) and captain (1892). He later transferred to the Australian Light Horse and was promoted major in 1905; in 1915 he became lieutenant-colonel of the 5th Light Horse Brigade and the oldest serving officer in the Light Horse. Despite his wishes he remained in Australia during World War I and retired from the armed services in 1920 as a colonel. In 1915 Merrett was appointed president of the Royal Agricultural Society of Victoria he would serve a record term of 32 years, retiring in 1947. He was involved in founding the Young Farmers and the Country Women's Association. He was also politically involved, and in 1913 ran for the federal seat of Melbourne Ports for the Liberal Party. His later career tended towards organisational politics but he became disenchanted with the Nationalist Party and instead he and Thomas Ashworth founded the Liberal Union, a breakaway group opposed to Billy Hughes' leadership. Although the Union only operated as a political entity at the 1922 election, when it elected two candidates to the House of Representatives, it continued to endorse Nationalist candidates throughout the 1920s. He would later be involved in the downfall of the Allan- Peacock state government in 1927, forming the short-lived Australian Liberal Party. Merrett served on South Melbourne Council from 1915 to 1937 and was mayor from 1922 to 1923. He was also the chairman of a number of organisations, including the Canned Fruits Export Control Board, the Big Brother Movement, the New Settlers League, the State Employment Council and the Society for the Protection of Animals. In 1929 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, and he was knighted in 1934. He died at Brighton in 1948.

In China, winter melon tea is believed to help people deal with hot temperatures. It is also called \\"slim tea\\", as it is thought to help one lose weight.  Ingredients  The winter melon is peeled, sliced, and its seeds are removed. Melon slices are stirred and cooked in boiling water with brown sugar and caramel for many hours. This mixture is filtered by net or gauze, ridding it of the dregs and impurities. Once the clean, brown liquid cools completely, it is then refrigerated, canned and sold as concentrated winter melon punch. It can also be dehydrated and cut into solid cubes, sold as winter melon punch cubes. A sugar-free version of the winter melon punch is made for patients suffering from nephropathy and diabetes. In this variation, the cooking process is the same except that only the melon slices and water are boiled to make the mixture. Some soak the winter melon slices in lime or calcium hydroxide to preserve the melon's original flavor by hardening the flesh before boiling them with sugar, caramel and water.  Variations  Different flavors of winter melon punch appear throughout Taiwan. People may add lemon juice, oolong tea or many other drinks to it, according to their preferences, to make mixed drinks or even cocktails.

Burke was born at Norval, near Ararat in Victoria, to Dublin-born miner William Marcus Burke and Aberdeen-born Mary Ann, n√©e Florence. He attended Norval State School and Ararat High School before becoming a railway clerk in 1887, overseeing first Spencer Street station and then Ararat from 1892. On 25 July 1898 he married Margaret Duggan Brady at St Mary's Catholic Church at Ararat. He was involved in the later stages of the Federation movement as president of the local branch of the Australian Natives' Association (ANA) and vice-president (1900-01) and chief president (1902-03) of the Victorian ANA. Burke was appointed secretary of the Civil Service Co-operative Society of Victoria in March 1902 and was involved in the railway workers' clash with the Irvine government; later that year he resigned from the railways and founded the Civil Service Co-operative Store in Flinders Street. An ardent protectionist, he contested the 1914 federal election as the Labor candidate for Corangamite but was defeated. He sold the Co-operative Store in 1915 and entered the real estate business, and by 1924 was also involved in finance and investment, with offices in Sydney, Newcastle, Brisbane, Adelaide and various country centres. Burke survived the Depression and during the 1930s his company, T. M. Burke Pty Ltd, had established branches in Auckland, Singapore and London.

Early life Harald Jensen was born in 1879 in Aarhus, Jutland to farmer Niels Georg Oscar Jensen and Clara (n√©e Nielsen), the latter of whom was purported to be a descendant of the great Danish poet Bernhard Severin Ingemann. Around 1885 the family migrated to Queensland, where young Harald attended public schools before winning a scholarship to Brisbane Boys' Grammar School.In 1898, Jensen was employed at Clement Wragge's observatory at Mount Kosciuszko before briefly studying at the University of Sydney; he took time off from 1900 to 1901 to teach in Sydney and North Queensland before returning to his studies in 1902, receiving a Bachelor of Science specialising in geology in 1904. He was employed as an assistant demonstrator to Edgeworth David before becoming the first Macleay fellow of the Linnean Society of New South Wales in 1905, allowing him to travel extensively in the Pacific, including to Fiji, Samoa, Tonga and New Zealand. He married Jane Elizabeth Ellen England on 26 September 1906 in Sydney. In 1908 he was awarded a Doctorate of Science and a university medal, and was employed by the New South Wales Department of Agriculture as a soil scientist, publishing Soils of New South Wales in 1914.  Career  Jensen was a member of the Australian Labor Party, publishing The Rising Tide: An Exposition of Australian Socialism in 1909 in which he advocated protectionism. Appointed director of mines in the Northern Territory in August 1912, he found himself in opposition to the Administrator, John Gilruth, who had him demoted in 1915, although he remained chief geologist. Jensen wrote to the minister for external affairs and territories and precipitated a royal commission into Gilruth's administration, which ultimately found against Jensen (a public service inquiry later exonerated him of making disloyal comments) and led to his forced resignation in September 1915. In 1917 he returned to Queensland, where he was a government geologist and contested the 1917 federal election as Labor candidate for Lilley. He ran on the Labor Senate tickets in 1922 and 1925, but was expelled from the party in August 1926 after attacking a perceived move away from socialism (he would run again for the Senate in 1928 as an independent). In 1923 Jensen was employed as a consultant geologist, searching for oil in the Roma basin and in New Guinea. Divorced in 1937, in 1938 he was appointed leader of the Queensland section of the Aerial Geological and Geophysical Survey of North Australia, which continued until 1940. He later became interested in meteorology and published Seasonal Forecasting in 1956. Jensen died in 1966 in Brisbane after being badly burnt in a grass fire. He was survived by five children. Two boxes of his papers are held in the Fryer Library at The University of Queensland.

The episode dealt with the Fringe team's investigation of a series of time loop fatalities. Robert Chiappetta and Glen Whitman co-wrote \\"And Those We've Left Behind\\", while Brad Anderson directed. Real-life husband and wife Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont guest starred as a married couple behind the time loop, one an electrical engineer and the latter a professor of theoretical physics. The episode first aired on November 11, 2011 in the United States to an estimated 3.07 million viewers. Its 1.1 ratings share for adults 18-49 resulted in a series low. Critical reception was generally positive, as television critics in particular praised the performances of guest stars Root and Rosemont. Plot Peter Bishop (Joshua Jackson), who has only recently appeared unexpectedly in the alternate timeline, is still being held by Fringe division, whose members have yet to come to fully trust him. Walter Bishop (John Noble) still disbelieves that Peter is his son, but, under orders from Broyles (Lance Reddick), studies him as a test subject. The sequence of time fluctuations is found to occur along a golden spiral. Fringe learns of several cases that involve time fluctuations. Broyles, while instructing Olivia (Anna Torv) and Lincoln (Seth Gabel) to investigate, orders them to bring Peter along to examine the scenes. Broyles is concerned that Peter's reappearance may have created further tears between the prime and parallel universe leading to these events. The three find the time events are localized, returning the affected area to conditions four years ago for short periods of time before dissipating, such as a building reverting to a fire- worn state, or a train crossing on a long-disused set of tracks. Peter finds himself further jumping through time near these events. Recognizing the presence of time manipulation, the three return to Walter's lab to try to find a pattern in the event. Walter initially refuses to help with Peter's involvement, but soon postulates that the events occur along a spiral defined by the golden ratio, and believe they will find the source of the disturbance at the center of the spiral. Lincoln and other agents use an extent of the spiral to try to predict future mishaps that may be more damaging, while Olivia and Peter arrange an FBI search of the spiral's center to find the source. One FBI agent is vaporized while approaching a suburban home, and Walter recognizes that a time bubble is surrounding the home. Isolating the extent of the time bubble, they find the home belongs to a couple, Raymond (Stephen Root) and Kate (Romy Rosemont) Green; Kate was a distinguished professor in physics at a nearby university until three years ago when she was diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease. Walter devises a portable Faraday cage that Peter offers to wear to enter the time bubble safely. Inside, he finds that Raymond, a skilled electrical engineer, used Kate's research to construct a giant machine in the basement of their house that creates a temporary time bubble. Raymond has used the machine to revert their home to the state four years prior, before Kate fully suffered from rapid deterioration of Alzheimer's, and has been convincing her younger version to complete her research to allow him to stabilize the time bubble permanently. Raymond notes that he has successfully gotten the machine to work only in the last few days. Lincoln informs the others that they have found the next time distortion event, threatening to flood drivers in a tunnel that did not exist four years prior. The younger Kate, having only recently discovered what Raymond has done, recognizes the side effects of the time bubble, and urges Raymond to shut it down, asking Peter to guarantee that Raymond will not be prosecuted due to his lack of understanding of the effects. As Peter discusses this with the FBI, Kate reveals she has completed the proper equations, and Raymond asks her to write them out in a notebook so that he can recreate the time bubble machine in a remote location. When Peter returns with his assurances of Raymond's fate, Raymond disables the machine; the house reverts to its present-day state, with Kate bound to a wheelchair. The time distortion in the tunnel dissipates before it can harm anyone else. The Fringe division and the FBI remove the time bubble equipment from the house; Raymond, having kept Kate's notebook, discovers that she had blacked out all the equations, leaving a final message to him to keep on living his life and giving her his love. Back at Fringe division, Peter notes that Raymond's success with the time bubble started simultaneously with his appearance in the alternate timeline. Broyles thanks Peter for his help, and offers to allow him to stay in the home Walter owns on campus. Peter attempts to try to explain to the Olivia of this timeline his relationship with the Olivia of his original timeline. Production The episode was co-written by executive story editors Glen Whitman and Robert Chiappetta, while former Fringe producer, Brad Anderson, directed. This episode guest stars real-life husband and wife Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont portraying the roles of Raymond and Kate Green, and is the first time they have played alongside each other in a creative work. Their appearance on the show came by way of a party at Northwestern University, where Rosemont had met with executive producer Jeff Pinkner. Pinkner asked Rosemont if her husband would be interested in guest-starring on a Fringe episode; Rosemont quickly affirmed he would, but only if she was also asked to participate. Music and cultural references When Walter leaves Olivia and Peter behind in the lab, the song \\"No Time\\" by The Guess Who is playing in his room. While Peter and Olivia theorize in the lab, Walter listens on his headphones to the song \\"Too Much Time on My Hands\\" by American rock band Styx. Walter references the Marvel Comics superhero Spider-Man when directing Astrid to find his fannypack. While studying the time anomaly, Peter Bishop consults the fictional book Cosmology by real-world physicist Sean M. Carroll. Reception =Ratings= \\"And Those We've Left Behind\\" was first broadcast on November 11, 2011 on the Fox network in the United States. An estimated 3.07 million viewers tuned in with a 1.1 rating for adults 18‚Äì49, a series low. =Reviews= The performances of Stephen Root (pictured) and his wife Romy Rosemont were praised by critics. The A.V. Club writer Noel Murray graded the episode with an A, calling it \\"an at once tense and moving episode of Fringe.\\" Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Jeff Jensen believed the episode was \\"high grade Fringe, in my opinion, heartfelt and heady, a fraternal twin to the season 2 classic 'White Tulip.'\\" Jensen in particular highlighted the scene involving Peter's time-jumps while the Fringe team is investigating train tracks, comparing it to the experiences of main character Billy Pilgrim in the novel Slaughterhouse Five. He explained, \\"The storytelling, editing, and acting worked together marvelously to create a clever, clear, and funny passage. Kudos to Joshua Jackson for recognizing and nailing the wry comedy of it all.\\" Fearnet writer Alyse Wax also lauded \\"And Those We've Left Behind\\", explaining that \\"once you get past all the hardcore theoretical physics, this is a great episode. It's a pretty emotional episode but not in a sappy way.\\" IGN's Ramsey Isler was pleased with Joshua Jackson's return, but criticized the writers for once again producing the 'mad scientist whose best intentions to save a loved one have dramatic consequences' trope.... each time the series does it we get diminishing returns.\\" Murray, Jensen, and Hitfix reviewer Ryan McGee also noted references to the science fiction drama series Lost, including the use of the name Faraday as well as the mention of constants and the Red Sox winning the 2007 World Series. Critics praised the performances of guest stars Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named \\"And Those We've Left Behind\\" the tenth best episode of the series, calling it \\"an episode worthy of one of Fringes key inspirations, The Twilight Zone, with exceptional guest players taking center stage in a clever, wise, emotionally rich story in which an electrical engineer fought an unwinnable battle to gain more time with his beloved, Alzheimer's-afflicted genius wife via time travel tech. The couple was well-played by real life husband-and-wife Stephen Root and Romy Rosemont.\\" In a similar 2013 list, Den of Geek ranked the episode as the fourth best episode of the entire series.

DeLong was the lead profiler in San Francisco, California, and worked on the Unabomber case. Currently, she hosts the Investigation Discovery programs Deadly Women and Facing Evil with Candice DeLong. Early life Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, DeLong is the daughter of a building contractor father and a homemaker mother. Growing up, DeLong stated that her father had told her to choose a practical career. Before entering the field of criminal profiling, DeLong worked as a psychiatric nurse at Northwestern University Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. However, by the time she was 28 years old, she was a divorcee with a young son. Wanting a new career, DeLong went to Quantico, Virginia, in 1980 to attend the FBI training academy. She was one of only seven female recruits. DeLong worked in the FBI's Chicago office after graduating from Quantico. DeLong stated that she used humor to ease tensions while working. She claimed that her three career goals were as follows: \\"to be involved with a high-profile national criminal, I wanted to apprehend a serial killer, and I wanted to rescue a kidnap victim alive.\\" Career In 1982, DeLong became involved in the investigation of the Chicago Tylenol murders, in which seven people died from potassium cyanide-laced Tylenol capsules. Although no one was ever charged in the poisonings, the incident led to new packaging for over-the-counter medication and federal anti-tampering laws. Regarding the incident, DeLong stated that \\"You can thank the Tylenol killer for the fact that it now takes a blow torch to get into a bottle of Tylenol.\\" In 1995, DeLong was one of the three handpicked FBI agents to mastermind the manhunt for the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski. Kaczynski had sent 16 bombs over a 17-year period to target areas, killing three people. After his 1995 capture in Lincoln, Montana, DeLong wrote that \\"he only cared about two things ‚Äî his little quarter-acre of property and killing people.\\" DeLong, a member of the Child Abduction Task Force in San Francisco, California, stated that the greatest day of her career was when she was able to rescue a nine-year-old kidnapping victim who had been given crack cocaine and been forced to participate in child pornography. After learning of the abductor's whereabouts on a train in San Diego, California, the boy was saved. Following DeLong's July 2000 retirement from the FBI, she published a book entitled Special Agent: My Life on the Front Lines as a Woman in the FBI. In the book, she discusses the criminal profiling process and how she helped solve high- profile cases. DeLong also dedicated a chapter in her book to personal safety, stating that \\"Prevention can be as simple as a deadbolt lock on your house.\\" In the early days of the investigation of the disappearance of Laci Peterson, DeLong stated in an interview with Diane Sawyer on Good Morning America that Laci's husband Scott Peterson was speaking about Laci in the past-tense, even though her body had not yet been discovered. She was also criticized by Scott's supporters for saying that a pregnant Longview, Washington, woman who had appealed to a store clerk for help could not have been Laci Peterson because the woman claimed to have been kidnapped. After the acquittal of Casey Anthony in the death of Caylee Anthony, DeLong told the Huffington Post that the prosecution must have offended the jury, because the amount of circumstantial evidence should have been enough to convict Casey. DeLong currently hosts two programs on the Investigation Discovery Network: Deadly Women and Facing Evil with Candice DeLong. She serves as a subject-matter expert on Deadly Women, offering her professional opinions about the women profiled on the show. On Facing Evil, DeLong has profiled Jennifer Reali, Jennifer Hyatte, Susan Grund, Belinda Van Krevel, Patricia Olsen, Celeste Beard, Dawn Silvernail, Ashley Humphrey, Jill Coit, Rachel Wade, Shirley Jo Phillips, Tyonne Palmer, Jennifer Bailey, and Melissa Vanover from the inside of a prison, discussing the women's motive for murder.

In 1857 he established a private psychiatric hospital at his homestead in Bendorf, where he created a humanitarian environment for the mentally ill based on a philosophy he called the \\"familiare system\\" (family system). In the following decades the facility underwent considerable expansion in size and function. At Bendorf he strove in providing living conditions for the mentally ill that were the equivalent to those of the healthy, non-institutionalized public. He believed that his patients should have a place where they \\"felt at home\\", and deemed it necessary to assess and treat them on an individual basis.

Biography Foster was born at Beechworth to tobacconist Alfred William Foster and Sarah, n√©e Brown. He attended school locally and graduated from Beechworth College at the age of fourteen. Interested in spiritualism, around this time Foster rejected Christianity as lacking in scientific evidence. He moved to Melbourne to study law in 1906, where he joined the Victorian Rationalist Association; after a defeat in a debate on socialism against a Victorian Socialist Party team including John Curtin, Foster became a convert to socialism and joined the party himself. He was called to the Bar in June 1910 but struggled in his early legal career. In 1914 Foster became a prominent opponent of Australia's involvement in World War I, and he was later a strident anti-conscriptionist, defending those charged under the War Precautions Act and risking conviction himself with some of his speeches. He was also opposed to the Hughes government's censorship laws, and joined the Labor Party during the war, becoming a member of the central executive and standing for the federal seat of Balaclava in 1917 following the party split. He had married Beatrice May Warden on 12 January 1916. He joined the Food Preservers' Union, of which he became president, and was a delegate to the Victorian ALP Conference and the Trades Hall Council. He unsuccessfully contested the federal seat of Fawkner in 1922 and 1925. In 1920 Foster was appointed as union advocate to the royal commission on the basic wage and successfully argued for an increase, although the recommendation was not implemented. His wife died from cancer in 1925. In 1924 he was counsel assisting the royal commission on the 1923 Melbourne police strike, and in 1926 represented the New South Wales and Queensland Labor governments in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration case regarding standard working hours. In 1927 he resigned all political positions to become a judge in the County Court of Victoria; while he enforced the written laws he continued to advocate reform. On 25 January 1927 he married Ella Wilhelmina Jones. In 1934 he attracted controversy for telling a young witness, \\"There is no hell, sonny.\\" He became a pacifist in the 1930s and after the outbreak of World War II supported close relations with the Soviet Union. In October 1942 Foster was appointed to head the Women's Employment Board before being transferred to the Commonwealth Arbitration Court in October 1944. He was involved in a major case on standard hours that ran from 1945 to 1947 and delivered the judgement on the forty-hour week. In 1950 he influenced the decision to increase the weekly wage by ¬£1. Despite being considered early in his term as a champion for the unions, he decided against eight officials who defied the Chifley government's emergency laws against assisting strikers in 1949. In 1952 he was assigned to the maritime industry and encouraged the replacement of outdated vessels, created a new seamen's award in 1955 and adjusted it to placate shipowners in 1960. He died at Sandringham in 1962.

Description The site consists of the Towerrining Lake, a highly modified brackish lake, with adjacent brackish swampland to its north-west, unofficially known as Moodiarrup Swamp NW. It encompasses the Towerrining Nature Reserve. The lake receives water from the swamp, rainfall and local streams. It has open water bordered by a fringe of paperbarks. Waterskiing is seasonally popular, with a caravan park, campsite and picnic grounds adjacent to the wetlands. When flooded, the semi-permanent swamp consists of open water with isolated shrubs and stands of dead trees. The wetlands have suffered from rising water levels and increased salinity but continue to be important for many waterbirds. The region has a temperate Mediterranean climate with cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers.BirdLife International. (2011). Important Bird Areas factsheet: Towerrining Lake and Moodiarrup Swamps.

The name of the genus comes from the Greek words pyros meaning 'fire' and soma meaning 'body', referring to the bright bioluminescence sometimes emitted.Pyrosoma atlanticum (Peron, 1804) : Pyrosome The JelliesZone. Retrieved 2011-11-10. The specific epithet atlanticum refers to the Atlantic Ocean, from where the first specimen of the species was collected for scientific description; it was described in 1804 by Fran√ßois P√©ron, a French naturalist. Description A. side view of the entire colony; B. end view of an open extremity Pyrosoma atlanticum washed up on the beach in California A colony of P. atlanticum is cylindrical and can grow up to long and wide. The constituent zooids form a rigid tube, which may be pale pink, yellowish, or bluish. One end of the tube is narrower and is closed, while the other is open and has a strong diaphragm. The outer surface or test is gelatinised and dimpled with backward-pointing, blunt processes. The individual zooids are up to long and have a broad, rounded branchial sac with gill slits. Along the side of the branchial sac runs the endostyle, which produces mucus filters. Water is moved through the gill slits into the centre of the cylinder by cilia pulsating rhythmically. Plankton and other food particles are caught in mucus filters in the processes as the colony is propelled through the water. P. atlanticum is bioluminescent and can generate a brilliant blue-green light when stimulated.Pyrosoma atlanticum Marine Species Identification Portal. Retrieved 2011-11-11. Distribution and habitat P. atlanticum is found in temperate waters in all the world's oceans, usually between 50¬∞N and 50¬∞S. It is most plentiful at depths below 250 m (800 ft).Pyrosoma atlanticum - P√©ron, 1804 SeaLifeBase. Retrieved 2011-11-11. Colonies are pelagic and move through the water column. They undergo a large diurnal migration, rising toward the surface in the evening and descending around dawn. Large colonies may rise through a vertical distance of 760 m (2,500 ft) daily, and even small colonies a few millimetres long can cover vertical distances of 90 m (300 ft). Biology A study in the Indian Ocean comparing different zooplankton organisms found that colonies of P. atlanticum were the most efficient grazers of particles above 10 ¬µm in diameter, catching a higher proportion of the particles than other grazers. This implies the species uses high biomass intake as a strategy, rather than investing in energy-conservation mechanisms. Growth occurs by new rings of zooids being budded off around the edge of the elongating colony. A pair of luminescent organs is on either side of the inlet siphon of each zooid. When stimulated, these turn on and off, causing rhythmic flashing. No neural pathway runs between the zooids, but each responds to the light produced by other individuals, and even by light from other nearby colonies. Ecology Five specimens of the penaeid shrimp Funchalia were found living inside colonies of P. atlanticum. Other amphipods also lived there, including the hyperiids Phronima and Phronimella spp. Predators of P. atlanticum include various bony fishes, such as the spiky oreo, the big-eyed cardinalfish, and the pelagic butterfish, dolphins, and whales such as the sperm whale and giant beaked whale.

Bowling was born in Stirling, Scotland to miner Patrick Bowling and Marguerite MacGuire. They lived in mining housing in Dunfirmline, Fife. He started working in the mines at the age of twelve and migrated to New South Wales on board the Duke Of Westminster, arriving in Australia when he was 19. He worked around Newcastle. He married Mary Ann Madden at Branxton on 5 September 1889. He worked in Gippsland in the 1890s, where he was involved in founding a miners' union, but returned to New South Wales and in 1893 was elected as an official of the Back Creek miners' lodge. He joined the Australian Socialist League in 1897 and was influenced by the Industrial Workers of the World, supporting direct action and strong unions. Appointed treasurer of the Colliery Employees' Federation, a northern union, in 1904 and president in 1906-10, he was influential in uniting the northern, western and southern unions as the Australian Coal and Shale Employees' Federation in 1908. Bowling was a militant socialist and supported confrontation against the mine owners, calling for a general strike which eventuated in November 1909. Supporting radical action against the calls for moderation from his fellow mining representative Billy Hughes, Bowling was arrested for conspiracy in Newcastle on 4 December and later physically attacked Hughes while out on bail. In January 1910 Bowling, Daniel Hutton, James Butler and William O'Connor were charged in relation to taking part in a later strike meeting at Bulli on 29 December. Bowling represented himself, while the others were represented by Each were convicted and Judge Rogers sentenced each to imprisonment, Bowling for 12 months and the others 8 months. In February 1910 5 leaders of 2 unions were indicted on 3 conspiracy charges to instigate the coal miners strike in November and December 1909. From the Northern Miners' Federation were Bowling, president, William Brennan, secretary, Amram Lewis, treasurer and from the Amalgamated Coal and Shale Workers Association, Andrew Gray secretary and Albert Burns, treasurer. Bowling, Brennan Burns and Lewis were represented by Mr Gannon and Mr Watt while Gray was represented by Andrew Lysaght. The prosecutors were Ernest Lamb and Thomas Bavin. The jury convicted all 5 and Justice Robert Pring sentenced each of them to imprisonment for 18 months. For Bowling this was to be in addition to the 12 months imposed by Judge Rogers, making a total of two and a half years' imprisonment. The strike ended in defeat in March 1910. Despite this apparent failure, Bowling was used in the Labor campaign for the 1910 state election, appearing on posters in leg-irons; Labor won government for the first time in New South Wales in that election. After his release Bowling visited New Zealand, during which time he lost his union presidency; he subsequently worked in a colliery in Balmain and the abattoir at Homebush. Initially an anti-conscriptionist, he switched to the conscriptionist camp in 1917 after four of his sons enlisted. Robert served in France in the Medical Corp. After the War, one of his sons jointed the NSW Police Force. Realising through his son that the Police had no formed union structure, Bowling was instrumental in the establishment and development of the NSW Police Union. In later years, he and Billy Hughes became close friends, particularly after Hughes' daughter first attempted to commit suicide by trying jumping off a ship steaming out of Perth on the way to the UK. After reaching London and giving birth to a son, she ultimately did suicide. As a single young woman, she was depressed by her pregnancy and feared family shame. During the 1920s Bowling worked on the Sydney wharves before retiring. He died of cerebral arteriosclerosis in 1942 at Sacred Heart Hospice in Darlinghurst.

History  The government started taking steps after the Second World War and the Korean War to protect the intangible heritage of the country.http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244‚ü®=en&page;_type=list The term was coined in 1960 by the young reporter Ye Yong-hae, who published a number of series in the Hankook Ilbo newspaper, highlighting the plight of artisans and artists who were either neglected or even persecuted under the regime of President Park under the Misin tapa undong modernization drive that was destroying the old traditional beliefs and fabrics of villages. In a growing recognition of the worthiness of protecting the old Korean traditions and culture, a law was passed to protect the intangible cultural heritage and the masters and artisans who were keeping it alive.http://www.koreana.or.kr/months/news_view.asp?b_idx=2244‚ü®=en&page;_type=list Over time the number of keepers of this heritage grew, but the list was also subject to criticism about the exact criteria and nomination process. The latest Important Intangible Cultural Property is bun-wa-jang, a traditional Korean roof building skill, which was designated in 2008. With the designation, Lee Geon-bok was approved as an ingan-munhwage in 2008. According to Jeon Byung-hon of the Democratic Party, twelve Important Intangible Cultural Properties of Korea have not had any ingan-munhwage for more than 10 years.  Definition  A Living National Treasure is a person with the ability to make or perform one of the officially designated Important Intangible Cultural Properties. Intangible culture assets are organized within 108 different aspects of Korean traditional culture, from traditional dance to building techniques. The ministry draws the list and puts the artist under its protection. It is advised by the Cultural Heritage Administration under the Cultural Properties Protection Law. Once people are designated as an holders, they have rights to government support for transmission of their cultural performance and have responsibility to show that ability and train younger students.

Family Judd was born at Scrubby Plains, near Forbes, New South Wales, the eldest of ten children of Ernest Augustus Judd (1861-1918), a road contractorDeath Certificates of both father and son, the latter GRO registration being 1959/23265. and his wife Alice Florence, n√©e Stephens (1865-1937).https://familyhistory.bdm.nsw.gov.au/lifelink/familyhistory/search/result?3 Ernest junior's four grandparents were all from England.Wikitree Upon reaching adulthood he moved to Sydney. Early political activities Ernie frequented W. H. McNamara's bookshop and The Domain in Sydney, and about 1907 he joined and became treasurer of the Socialist Labor Party, followers of Daniel de Leon in the United States of America, who in 1908 split from the Industrial Workers of the World. Judd, however, remained connected to the I.W.W. Club in Sydney. As an Independent Socialist Judd contested Wollongong in the New South Wales State Elections in 1913, winning 4.8% of the vote. In 1917 he contested King (Sydney) but lost decisively with only 0.4% of the vote. He was a delegate of the Municipal Workers' Union to the Labor Council of New South Wales during World War I, an opponent of conscription and, with H. E. Boote and P. S. Brookfield, critics of the trial of members of the I.W.W. in 1916. Appointed by the Labor Council as investigator into the case, he worked vigorously for their release. Judd was prominent in the second conscription referendum campaign and secured a scoop when he published W. A. Holman's Secret Memorandum, which advocated dismissal of single men to encourage recruiting. He was unsuccessful as a Senate candidate in May 1917,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candidates_of_the_1917_Australian_federal_election although he secured 11,983 votes. Late in 1918, when resident in Albion Street, Surrey Hills, Sydney, the Commonwealth proceeded against him for making statements prejudicial to recruiting,Sydney Morning Herald 6 Dec 1918, p.5. and he was prosecuted under the War Precautions Act. Though he turned such trials into political drama, the jury found him guilty but urged leniency, which the sentencing judge said he felt had merit, fining Judd just ¬£25.Sydney Morning Herald, Tues 3 June 1919, p.5. Judd nevertheless appealed the conviction taking the case all the way to the Privy Council in London, where it was dismissed on 21 October 1919.Sydney Morning Herald Friday 24 Oct 1919, p.7. Publisher & bookseller Judd had begun his own publishing company and was proprietor of 'The Best Bookshop', 140 Castlereagh Street, in central Sydney,Sydney Morning Herald Mon 31 May 1926, p.9. advertising free- thought and birth-control literature in Liberator, the secularist newspaper. Among Judd's publications were The War and the Sydney Labor Council (1917) and Judd's Speech From the Dock (1919). In his The Case for the O.B.U. (1919), he urged the replacing of 'Class Governments' by an 'Industrial Parliament' and attacked the Australian Labor Party. In March 1919 Labor's John Storey repudiated 'Jock' Garden and Judd as 'limelighters and notoriety hunters'. In 1931 Judd published How to End Capitalism and Inaugurate Socialism and, with A. P. Warren, Why War is Near. Post-War Political activities In 1920 Judd was a powerful public speaker, still full haired and of imposing appearance. A police report noted that when he mounted the platform in the Domain, \\"audiences around the A.L.P. (Australian Labor Party) and other socialist platforms made a beeline for him.\\" The release of ten of the I.W.W. in 1920, after a second Royal Commission, appointed by the Storey government, was perhaps the peak of his reputation. But at State elections that year, standing for Sydney Central, he secured only 282 votes. Judd refused invitations to a unity conference of Sydney socialists in March 1921, denouncing the Communist Party as 'a front for capitalist spies'. When, on May 8, ex-soldiers and right-wing demonstrators beset him in the Domain, Judd drew a revolver later arguing that he thought his life was under threat; he was convicted of carrying a firearm and with offensive behaviour.Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 17 May 1921. Judd appealed on 12 Sept but it was dismissed with costs against Judd.Sydney Morning Herald 13 Sept 1921, p.7. As General Secretary of the S.L.P. from 1920, he experienced increasing difficulty in disciplining the industrial organizer A. W. Wilson who described him as 'a filthy minded . . . scurvy rascal . . . with a yellow streak'. Later Judd also fell out with Arnold Peterson, who had succeeded de Leon as head of the American party. Demoralized by declining support, Judd became possessive about party funds. His political court battles resumed. In 1926 he was fined ten shillings (10/-) for failing to vote (which was compulsory) in the 1925 Senate elections. In his defence he argued that it was impossible for him to vote for any of the candidates standing in his constituency.Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 4 May 1926, p.6. Angry by this decision he appealed it to the New South Wales Supreme Court, which upheld it. He then appealed to the Federal High Court, where four judges heard the case. Unfortunately for Judd only one judge, Mr Justice Higgins, agreed with him and the other three did not.Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 12 Oct 1926, p.11. Using the Revolutionary Socialist newspaper, he attacked R. J. Heffron and supported Tom Mutch in the seat of Botany at the 1927 and 1930 State elections. Heffron sued him over his propaganda in Botany. In November 1930 Judd, described as a \\"prominent member of the Socialist Labor Party\\" sued Sun Newspapers Ltd., for libel over their reports concerning him when he stood in North Sydney for election to the Federal Parliament in 1929. He won this and was awarded ¬£100 sterling damages.Sydney Morning Herald Friday 28 Nov 1930, p.8. Emboldened, in May 1932 he sued the Labor Daily newspaper for libel and for ¬£5000 damages concerning their reports of the same election. Although it was a jury trial and they returned a verdict in favour of Judd, derisory damages of one farthing were awarded to him and costs refused.Sydney Morning Herald Tuesday 31 May 1932, p.6. Still active in The Domain, on 9 January 1938 he was arrested for using \\"unseemly language\\" and on the 18th February, with Judd defending himself, was nevertheless fined ¬£5 and bound over to be of good behaviour for 12 months.Sydney Morning Herald Sat 19 Feb 1938, p.20. Death In 1929 he was still living in Albion Street, Surrey Hills, Sydney, but the following year, when he sued the Barrier Truth newspaper (Broken Hill) his address was given as Liverpool Street, Sydney (although this might have been an office address).Sydney Morning Herald Weds 9 July 1930, p.10. From the mid-1930s Judd's vision of human improvement declined; unkempt, he lived in the past. He died on 20 August 1959 in Rydalmere mental hospital. It is unclear why he was there. On his Death Certificate his \\"usual address\\" was given as Llandaff Street, Bondi Junction, Sydney. He was cremated without religious rites.

He fought in the American Revolutionary War as a British officer. He served in the House of Commons from 1769 to 1784 - before, during, and after that conflict. In 1777 he led a detachment of the Guards Brigade at the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. Besides his combat duties, he served as the inspector of the Hessian mercenary soldiers. After returning from America in 1777 he was promoted in rank to general officer. In 1787 he received advancement to lieutenant general. He is remembered in United States history for a clever but harsh comment that he made concerning the dead body of an American officer. Early career Born on 10 May 1742,Rayment, Penryn (Cornwall) Osborn was the oldest son of Sir Danvers Osborn, 3rd Baronet and educated at Westminster School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He succeeded to the baronetcy and the family seat at Chicksands Priory when his father died in 1753 while governor of the Province of New York. Osborn was a cousin of Frederick North, Lord North who was Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 1770 to 1782. He was the grandson of George Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax and the nephew of George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax. He was also a nephew of general and playwright John Burgoyne.McGuire (2006), 12-13 He served as Groom of the Bedchamber to King George III from 1770 to 1812.Correspondence, 398 He was elected on 24 April 1769 to the House of Commons for the Bossiney constituency in Cornwall.Rayment, Bossiney (Cornwall) On 12 October 1774 he was elected for the Penryn constituency in Cornwall. Like his relative Lord North, Osborn held Tory political beliefs.McGuire (2006), 35 American Revolutionary War During the American Revolutionary War he was captain of the grenadier company of the Guards Brigade with the rank of lieutenant colonel in the army. In addition to his other duties, he filled the post of Mustermaster-General and Inspector of the Foreign Troops.McGuire (2006), 6 The latter responsibility required him to keep track of the strength and condition of the Hessian and other German mercenaries. The information was sent to Lord George Germain, the Secretary of State for America.McGuire (2006), 12 For the American war, the British military establishment assembled the 1,000-man Guards Brigade by choosing the men by lottery from the 1st Foot Guards, 2nd, and 3rd Foot Guards. Brigadier General Edward Mathew commanded the unit which was split into two battalions of 500 troops each. Unlike the other regiments of foot, the light and grenadier companies of the Guards fought with their parent unit rather than being converged into elite battalions. Colonel Charles O'Hara, who later held important commands in the British army, belonged to the Guards Brigade.McGuire (2006), 33 Among his friends, Osborn counted Lieutenant Colonel William Harcourt of the 16th Light Dragoons,McGuire (2006), 54 Captain-lieutenant Richard FitzPatrick of the 1st Foot Guards, Lieutenant Colonel Sir John Wrottesley of the 2nd Foot Guards,McGuire (2006), 69 and Colonel Henry Monckton of the 2nd Grenadier Battalion.McGuire (2007), 213 Osborn reported on the state of the Hessian troops, which are shown here Near Raritan Landing, New Jersey on 31 May 1777, Lieutenant William Martin of Spencer's Additional Continental Regiment and a 20-man patrol were ambushed by 60 Hessian mounted and foot J√§gers under Captains Richard Lorey and Carl Wreden. In the first fire, three mounted J√§gers were wounded, two seriously. This infuriated the others and they set upon the Americans, killing Martin and six of his men while capturing seven more. When the Americans recovered Martin's body, it was found to be hideously mangled with seventeen sword wounds, \\"most of them mortal\\". The corpse was displayed to the American soldiers as proof of their enemies' brutality. Already irritated by incidents such as the bayoneting to death of Brigadier General Hugh Mercer at Princeton, Major General George Washington sent Martin's remains into the British lines under a flag of truce with a letter of protest. When the wagon bearing the corpse arrived at Osborn's picket post, he accepted the letter but refused the dead body.McGuire (2006), 29-31 His witty but heartless reply that he, \\"was no coroner\\", was received among British officers with great amusement and even made the rounds in London.Preston, 186 At the Battle of Brandywine on 11 September 1777, Mathew's brigade was part of Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis' division which had reached a position on the American right rear before being detected. At 4:00 PM, the Guards Brigade took position on the right flank of the first line. Osborn commanded both the grenadier company on the right and the light company which deployed as skirmishers in front.McGuire (2006), 204-205 They were opposed by the Maryland Division which was commanded by Major General John Sullivan. Since Sullivan was responsible for supervising the American right wing, he left the division under the leadership of Brigadier General Philippe Hubert Preudhomme de Borre. The Frenchman mishandled the Marylanders, throwing the division into confusion.McGuire (2006), 222 With the Americans in disarray, the attack of the Guards easily swept them aside. At the end of the day, the entire brigade reported only one killed, five wounded, and two missing. Of these, one casualty was from Osborn's grenadiers and three from the light company.McGuire (2006), 225 A few days after the battle Osborn and FitzPatrick caught two Guard grenadiers out plundering. The unfortunate soldiers were both sentenced to 500 lashes as punishment.McGuire (2006), 294 The night before the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Howe warned Osborn to expect trouble and the detached Guard grenadier and light companies took post on the far right flank next to the Queen's Rangers, a loyalist American unit. In the morning they were attacked by Brigadier General William Smallwood's Maryland militia and Brigadier General David Forman's New Jersey militia. The militia captured a few outworks but their organization soon unraveled in the face of opposition by professional soldiers. After driving back the American amateurs, the British swung to their left to flank Brigadier General Alexander McDougall's Connecticut Brigade.McGuire (2007), 105-109 On 10 November during the final part of the Siege of Fort Mifflin, Howe directed Osborn to lead an amphibious assault on the fort on Mud Island. Accordingly, he assembled his grenadier company plus an additional four officers, eight NCOs, two drummers, and 150 enlisted men from the Guards Brigade and marched to Province Island on the Delaware River. They were joined there by a detachment of light infantry, the 27th Foot and the 29th Foot.McGuire (2007), 200-201 Osborn planned to load eight flatboats with 35 soldiers each for the initial assault. In the event, the American garrison evacuated the fort on the night of 15 November and Osborn's detachment occupied the place without opposition.McGuire (2007), 210 On 16 December 1777, Osborn and Lord Cornwallis left Philadelphia aboard the armed ship Brilliant. During his tenure as Inspector of the Foreign Troops, he cultivated excellent relations with the Hessian officer corps. Upon his arrival in England, King George promoted Osborn to brigadier general. Having obtained leave from his regiment, he then traveled in Europe.McGuire (2007), 269 Later career On 30 November 1780, Osborn was elected to Parliament in a by-election, this time to the Horsham constituency in Sussex.Rayment, Horsham (Sussex) Osborn was promoted to lieutenant general in 1787. On 1 September 1795, Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany wrote a report to King George III after inspecting military units in the Northern District. The report stated that Osborn commanded the 3rd Dragoon Guards, the 8th Foot, and the Durham militia at Whitburn. The 8th Foot was praised as the best line regiment in the district though its officers were not in regulation uniforms. Only 100 troopers of the 3rd Dragoon Guards were present since two squadrons had been sent to the continent. The Durham militia were well-drilled but their uniforms and equipment were in bad condition. He was made Colonel of the 40th Regiment of Foot from 1786 to his death. He died on 29 June 1818. He had married twice; firstly Elizabeth, the daughter and coheiress of John Bannister, with whom he had a son and secondly Lady Heneage Finch, the daughter of Daniel, 7th Earl of Winchilsea. He was succeeded by his son John.

The Chagos‚ÄìLaccadive Ridge (CLR), also known as Chagos‚ÄìLaccadive Plateau, is a prominent volcanic ridge and oceanic plateau extending between the Northern and the Central Indian Ocean. Extending from 10¬∞S to 15¬∞N, the CLR includes the Laccadive, Maldives, and Chagos archipelagos and can be divided into three corresponding blocks, of which the first is continental and the two latter are oceanic. The CLR is asymmetrical with a steeper eastern slope and has an average depth of less than . It formed south of or near the Equator together with the remaining western continental margin of India, when India separated first from Madagascar in the Mid- Cretaceous and then from the Seychelles in the Late Cretaceous. Extent The CLR extends northward for from 10¬∞S at the southern end of the Chagos Archipelago to 14¬∞N around the Adas Bank. The second element of the name is for the Laccadive Islands, among the islands of Lakshadweep. (\\"Laccadive\\" is a form of the name \\"Lakshadweep\\".) The islands of Chagos, the Maldives and Lakshadweep are the above-water parts of the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge. The Laccadive Ridge, the northern part of the CLR, parallels the Indian west coast (8¬∞N‚Äì16¬∞N) and has an average width of . It is separated from the flanking basins by fault scarps made of thick, high-density crust. It is made of thinned continental crust marked by the volcanism that occurred near the KT- boundary c. 66 Ma. The western coastal margin of the Indian subcontinent was affected by two large igneous provinces at 85 Ma and 65 Ma. This left a complex of ridges that run parallel to the west coast of which the Laccadive Ridge is the larger. A complex of considerably smaller ridges constitutes a northern extension to the CLR. The Laxmi Ridge, the larger of these, is made of continental crust and formed during the Seychelles-India breakup. East of the Laxmi Ridge in the Laxmi Basin, the Panikkar Ridge is made of stretched continental crust and has a similar tectonic history. In contrast, the Palitana Ridge north of the Panikkar Ridge probably represents an extinct spreading centre and on the nearby shelf and slope a lineament, known as the Prathap Ridge Complex, is similarly made of oceanic crust and both are probably leftovers from the India‚ÄìMadagascar breakup. Formation The vast Chagos-Laccadive Ridge contains a considerable amount of volcanic rock, as does the southern part of the Mascarene Plateau. Although the Chagos-Laccadive Ridge is an aseismic ridge, between 1965 and 1970 an unusual, isolated swarm of earthquakes occurred on the west side of the Great Chagos Bank at approximately .

In Native American Algonquian language, Quinsigamond is loosely translated as \\"the pickerel (or long nose) fishing place.\\" Pickerel is a type of fresh water fish commonly native to inland lakes and ponds. Indian Names of places in Worcester County, Massachusetts (1848-1921) by Lincoln Kinnicutt 1905 p.43 Quinsigamond - Name references American Nipmuc Indians named the body of water between Worcester and Shrewsbury, \\"Quinsigamond\\", the largest lake in the East. Colonial settlers also adapted the name of the lake for a nearby village. Quinsigamond was also the name given to the area known today as \\"Worcester.\\" The name for Quinsigamond Community College, was also chosen to honor the rich cultural heritage of Worcester County.Quinsigamond Community College-A Biography by Eugene W. Butler, July 1975 Quinsigamond Lake - (Pre- Colonial times) During the early 1600s, more than 15,000 Nipmuc Native Americans roamed, in small clans, the areas known as; New England, Worcester County, Springfield, New Hampshire, Connecticut and Rhode Island. The Nipmucs were known as the original settlers of the area in western New England. This territory encompassed the central trail to all areas of the northeast called the \\"Great Path\\" or the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor. The Nipmucs or \\"western\\" band of Indians were known as the \\"fresh water fishing\\" tribe or \\"people from the small pond\\", since they inhabited inland areas of New England. The Nipmuc people were known as a hunting and gathering tribe who lived a \\"scattered existence.\\" They migrated during the seasons to follow their food source to hunt, fish, and to cultivate the \\"three sisters\\"; corn, beans and squash. They also made canoes out of hollowed out logs, which was their main mode of transportation on the lake.The Indians of the Nipmuc Country in Southern new England, 1630-1750, by Dennis A Connole Colonial arrival English settlers arrived to the Worcester County area and found, what looked to them as, dispersed yet abandoned villages. The Nipmuc that were encountered, were friendly and attempted to adopt the white man's ways. Rev. John Elliot introduced and converted many Native Americans to Christianity. Clusters of the converted Indians formed ‚Äúpraying towns‚Äù to practice their new religion. In 1637, the first settlement of Worcester was called the ‚ÄúVillage of Quinsigamond‚Äù or the ‚ÄúQuinsigamond Plantation.‚Äù Three buildings formed the heart of the Village, Quinsigamond branch library, the Quinsigamond school, and the Quinsigamond fire house. It functioned as a self-sustaining community which was predomidantly populated with Swedish and Irish immigrants.Telegram and Gazette, Wednesday, September 22, 1993 Article entitled Saving Quinsigamond Buildings Land Rights Law The English persuaded the Nipmuc people to allow the purchase of large amounts of land for minimal compensation. In 1652, the ‚ÄúIndian Land Rights Law‚Äù was passed. The law stated that Indian tribes would forfeit the title of their land if they hadn't made improvements upon it. When the Nipmuc realized their land was being taken from them, they joined the rise of King Philip's War. King Philip's War (1675-1676) A man named Metacomet was a Wampanoag Indian leader who was known as King Philip. He was mainly responsible for initiating the war. Metacomet and his band of Wampanoag Indians fought the colonist after the land called Plymouth was taken from them. King Philip's War was brutal and devastated most of the settlements in New England. By the time the war had ended, most of the villages approximately from Marlboro to Grafton were destroyed, having been burnt to the ground. The remaining Nipmuc Indians in the area, were captured and exiled to Deer Island in Boston Harbor without proper clothing, food, or provisions. The bulk of the Nipmuc population perished, or were forced to live on reservations in the Worcester County area. The overall toll of the conflict dwindled the size of the Indian bands considerably to less than 1,000. Industrialization of Worcester In 1684, the English settlers of Quinsigamond Village changed their community name to \\"Worcester\\", to honor the King of England's defeat during the Civil War.Telegram & Gazette, Saturday March 14, 1998 article entitled Reception salutes Quinsigamond Village In 1722, Worcester became a town and grew into a city, focusing its efforts on promoting the tourism industry. The Quinsigamond Lake area grew into an amusement park tourist attraction offering picnic areas, boat rides, concerts, a dance hall, and a rollerskating rink. Horrace Bigelow purchased much of the land around the lake for summer homes. He also owned much of the lake real estate and boasted to friends that the park was drenched in \\"fifty thousand electric lights.\\" Thus, the east side of the lake area became nicknamed \\"White City\\". The colonists also utilized the lake for recreational sports like swimming, boating, fishing. Competitive rowing teams were extremely popular on the lake. The Olympic rowing trials were held on Lake Quinsigamond in 1952. Modern day Today, Nipmuc people live on the Chaubunagungamaug Reservation area in Webster, and the Hassanamisco Reservation in Grafton. The Indian population is about 2,000 people. Many continue the old way of life and carry on the traditions of their ancestors. The Quinsigamond Lake region is no longer home to an amusement park but a shopping area, and there are two state parks on the lake. The current usage of Quinsigamond Lake remains popular for recreational use. Many college and area club rowing teams continue to utilize the lake for this sport. As the second largest city in Massachusetts, Worcester became known as \\"the heart of the commonwealth\\" and has continued to prosper. Quinsigamond Community College has flourished as one of six biggest colleges in the Worcester Area. It has also continued to proudly bear the iconic original name of \\"Quinsigamond‚Äù and represent the rich cultural Native American history.

Lundie was born at Portland Estate, South Australia to railway labourer John Lundie and Mary Ann Josephine, n√©e Moran. He was educated at local Port Adelaide public schools but at the age of eleven began working as a station-hand in western New South Wales. He joined the Amalgamated Shearers' Union of Australasia (which amalgamated to form the Australian Workers' Union in 1894) in 1887 and was president of the Adelaide branch from 1889. He served as an organiser from 1892 until his appointment as secretary from 1900, a position he would hold until his death in 1933. He was a leader of the 1894 shearers' strike and was president of the United Labourers' Union's South Australian branch from 1907 to 1912. He married Elizabeth Margaret Battens Armstrong on 20 January 1891; she died in 1907, and he remarried on 20 January 1909 to Edith Mary Armstrong, Elizabeth‚Äôs cousin. A moderate supporter of direct action, Lundie was also a member of the United Labor Party and strongly believed it should remain under the control of the working class rather than politicians and union leaders. He engaged in bitter disputes with the Verran Labor government in 1910, and continued low-level opposition to the party leadership until 1917, when he was able to harness the resentment over the conscription split to take over the party. Lundie was elected president of the party executive and later that year defeated William Spence to become the AWU's national president, a position he held until his own defeat by Arthur Blakeley in 1919. His attempts at direct political involvement had been less successful: he was defeated for the Senate in 1917 and 1919 and for the South Australian House of Assembly in 1905 and 1924. He was, however, a member of Port Adelaide City Council from 1900 to 1909 and Adelaide City Council from 1909 to 1931. A teetotaller, Lundie died in 1933; his funeral was attended at the West Terrace Cemetery by around a thousand people.

He was the brother of Sir William Egerton. Egerton was returned as Member of Parliament for Brackley, Northamptonshire on the family interest at the 1695 English general election. He voted for fixing the price of guineas at 22 shillings in March 1695, and voted for the attainder of Sir John Fenwick on 25 November 1696.

Born at Rocky Lead near Daylesford in Victoria to Irish-born teacher Henry Russell and Maria Louisa, n√©e Doyle. Young Edward became a compositor, and on 24 October 1890 married Catherine McCoy at Dandenong. They moved to Port Melbourne in 1894; Russell continued as a compositor until 1899. He subsequently worked intermittently as a labourer, a candlemaker and a casual dockhand. He later worked as a \\"vat man\\" in a soap factory; the family struggled financially at this time. Russell was appointed secretary of the Victorian Agricultural Implement Makers' Society in August 1907 despite not working in this area; his membership of the Victorian Socialist Party is believed to have helped him get the position. He represented the society in the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration against Hugh Victor McKay in September 1907; his wife Kate was used by H. B. Higgins in his landmark Harvester Judgement as an example of struggling working-class women. After the High Court struck down the decision Russell and his union were once more in financial stress. In January 1911 the union declared that all industry workers were required to join; McKay and the employers responded with a lockout and the use of free labour and Russell was forced to compromise for only small wage increases. His membership of the Labor Party was sporadic, contesting local elections in Port Melbourne as a revolutionary socialist in 1907, but he served as a Labor councillor for Port Melbourne from 1912 to 1914 (mayor in 1913). He contested East Gippsland in the 1911 state election and Echuca in the 1919 federal election and organised the anti-conscription campaign in South Australia in 1916-17\\\\. From 1918 to 1919 he was President of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council. His union bankrupt, Russell kept a lower profile during the 1910s. He and the union returned to the arbitration court in 1925 to seek further wage increases, but their case was rejected. In 1926 an attempt to reduce work hours was also unsuccessful, and unemployment in the industry forced Russell to call for increased tariffs on machinery. The financial situation did not improve during the Depression, during which Russell's salary was ¬£1 per week, and he resigned in February 1933. He and his son Roy, who had worked as an honorary assistant, claimed ¬£500 in back payments; Roy addressed the union in 1936 claiming his father was destitute and threatening to go to the press and the union agreed to pay the debt in ¬£1 instalments. Russell died in 1943 at Footscray.

B5. Consisting of Joe Ragosta (vocals), Anthony Mingoia (drums), Robert Ragosta (guitar), Rob Felicetti (guitar, vocals), and Corey DeVincenzo (bass), the band had self-released various EPs before releasing its debut album, Save Each Other, the Whales Are Doing Fine, in 2006 with original vocalist Michael Ragosta, and bassist Drew Buffardi on We Put Out Records. In 2009 Patent Pending released an EP, Attack of the Awesome!!!, with Joe Ragosta and Michael Ragosta switching on lead vocals, and Jay Beiner on bass guitar. Michael Ragosta left the band shortly after the EP's release, with lead vocal duties permanently replaced by Joe Ragosta.

Since the group's formation, Patent Pending has released three full-length albums, ten extended plays, and ten singles to date. History =Formation (2001)= Patent Pending was formed in 2001 by Joe Ragosta and Drew Buffardi while the two were attending Mount Sinai High School in Mount Sinai, New York. The band was started hastily in order to perform at a local open mic night Ragosta and Buffardi had heard about, recruiting Joe's younger brother Michael on lead vocals, and approaching Anthony Mingoia as he was the only drummer they knew of in their school. Patent Pending began to play shows around Long Island, gaining a consistent following in Nassau County, while the band hailed from adjacent Suffolk County. The group began recording demo CDs with some songs that would go on to be re-recorded and re-released on the band's future albums. =Early releases and Save Each Other, the Whales Are Doing Fine (2001‚Äì2006)= The band release its debut EP, Meet the Fat Kids, in 2001, which was self-released and contained only 2 songs.

Patent Pending released two more EPs in 2002, Air Drew and Drive By, and second full-length EP, Don't Quit Your Day Job. Later in 2004 the band released the EP, ...Is Your Biological Father, filming the group's first music video for the song \\"The June Spirit\\".

The album's original title, \\"Save The Children, The Whales Are Doing Fine\\", spawned legal issues pursued by the Save the Children Foundation, causing the album to be retitled and the original release date of May 9, 2006, was changed to June 6, 2006. The album achieved moderate commercial success, selling over 10,000 copies due to the band's inclusion on the entire 2006 Vans Warped Tour, and supporting Gym Class Heroes and Cobra Starship on a tour immediately following.Gamboa, Glenn (March 20, 2011). \\"The Long Island sound: Patent Pending gets inventive\\", Newsday, p.

Altenberg, who was Jewish by birth, was a business partner of the young Adolf Hitler in his Vienna period (190913), which has been cited as evidence for the thesis that Hitler, at this time in Vienna, was not an anti- Semite.  Early life  Jakob Altenberg was born in Hrymailiv, near Skalat, eastern Galicia-Lodomeria (in present-day Ukraine), in 1875. He was the son of a Jewish couple, Moses and Sarah Altenberg. As a young man, Altenberg travelled to Vienna, where he learned gilding. Later, he cast off his Jewish faith, and in 1902 married a Catholic Viennese innkeeper's daughter. The marriage produced two children, daughter Adele (b. 1896) and son James Jr. (b. 1902).Mommsen, Hans; Hamann, Brigitte. Hitler's Vienna: A Portrait of the Tyrant as a Young Man. Tauris Parke Paperbacks, 2010. p.173. In 1898, Altenberg opened his first store as a frame dealer and goldsmith at 37 . Within a few years he became a successful operator of a small framing workshop and a thriving chain of frame shops and art, in which frames were offered for sale, along with pictures and small art objects (characters, etc.). In addition to its headquarters in the Wiedner Hauptstra√üe, three other branches were later established, including a business on Vienna's largest shopping street, .  Relationship with Hitler  From 1909 to 1913, Altenberg was in business contact with the young Adolf Hitler, who lived at that time as a painter in Vienna. Until his move to Germany in May 1913, Hitler supplied Altenberg's stores on a regular basis with his own paintings, mostly watercolours, which Altenberg used as filler for the frames on display. The relationship between Hitler and Altenberg was good regardless of Altenberg's Jewish ancestry, and Altenberg is reported to have said that he never heard Hitler utter an anti-Semitic remark.Mommsen, Hans. Hitler and Vienna: The Truth about his Formative Years\\", in The Third Reich Between Vision and Reality. Berg Publishers, 2003. p.34.  Later life  After the Anschluss in 1938, Altenberg's business was \\"Aryanized\\", his property was confiscated, and he was reduced to a minimum pension. He sold the remainder of Hitler's paintings, for a small sum, to the main archive of the NSDAP. He escaped deportation after 1942 because his wife was Aryan. He died in Vienna in 1944.

It is set in a future near-apocalyptic city in a world suffering the ravages of severe climate change, where almost everybody is depressed. Symptomatic of this, the pivotal Tuvache family is named after a trio of celebrity suicides ‚Äì patriarch \\"Mishima\\" Tuvache is meant to evoke Yukio Mishima, while their eldest son Vincent Tuvache is named after Vincent van Gogh and their daughter Marilyn Tuvache is meant to mirror Marilyn Monroe. Their younger son Alain is named after British mathematician and cryptographer Alan Turing, but proves to be the white sheep of the family. Synopsis Within the aforementioned Tuvache family, which runs a shop for suicide equipment amidst these dire circumstances and instructs customers on their use, Alain is born and almost immediately begins to subvert its melancholic orientation. The family has two other children ‚Äì it is the anorexic oldest brother, Vincent, who is the creator of the shop's suicide-oriented hardware, and he has an equally maladjusted and obese sister, Marilyn, who hates her life. Over time, Mishima, Vincent and Marilyn try to break Alain's independent, optimistic outlook on life but never succeed. As time goes on, first Vincent and Marilyn, and then Mishima, are subverted by their exuberant sibling and offspring, until the Suicide Shop transmutes into a novelty store, sending up its earlier macabre and melancholic orientation. In a twist, however, it is Alain who ends his life at the close of the book, aware that he has provided a raison d'√™tre to reject melancholy and morbidity within his family and the surrounding community.

The film concerns the exceedingly nice but somewhat dimwitted Doug Glatt (Scott), who unexpectedly finds personal and professional fulfillment after becoming the enforcer for a minor league ice hockey team. Despite receiving largely positive reviews, the film was a box office disappointment, only earning $7 million against its $12 million budget. After premiering on Netflix it became an unexpected success, leading to an increase in DVD sales and VOD downloads, ultimately resulting in a sequel being greenlit.Could Goon 3 Happen? The sequel, Goon: Last of the Enforcers, was released on March 17, 2017, with Baruchel serving as director. Plot Doug Glatt (Seann William Scott), is a polite, kind-hearted, but dimwitted bouncer at a bar in Massachusetts. Doug feels ostracized from society, especially since his father and brother are both successful physicians. Doug attends a minor league hockey game with his best friend Pat (Jay Baruchel). Pat taunts the visiting team during a fight and one of their players climbs into the stands, calling him a homophobic slur. Doug, whose brother is gay, steps in and easily beats up the opposing player. Soon after, Doug gets a phone call from the coach of his hometown team, who offers him a job as an enforcer. Meanwhile, veteran enforcer and Doug's idol Ross \\"The Boss\\" Rhea (Liev Schreiber) is demoted to the minors after serving a 20-game suspension for slashing an opponent in the head from behind. Three years prior, Rhea hit and concussed the highly skilled prospect Xavier Laflamme (Marc-Andr√© Grondin), who has had trouble recovering from the incident due to his fear of being hit again. As a result, Laflamme is still stuck in the minors, playing for the Halifax Highlanders. As Doug's reputation grows, eventually earning the nickname \\"Doug the Thug,\\" the Highlanders' coach hires Doug to protect Laflamme and be his roommate. The Highlanders experience success with Doug as their enforcer, and he quickly becomes popular among fans and teammates, much to the chagrin of his parents and Laflamme, who loses ice time and the alternate-captaincy to Doug. Meanwhile, Doug becomes romantically involved with Eva (Alison Pill), a hockey fan with a penchant for sleeping with players. With four games left on their schedule, the Highlanders need two wins to secure a playoff spot. On a road game in Quebec, after an opposing player concusses Laflamme with a heavy hit, Doug savagely beats the player unconscious and is suspended for the next game against Rhea and the St. John's Shamrocks. Doug encounters Rhea at a diner, where Rhea dismisses Doug's belief that he is a hockey player, insisting that they are both \\"goons\\". Though Rhea acknowledges Doug's physical prowess and gives Doug his respect, Rhea warns him that if they ever meet on the ice, he will \\"lay him the fuck out.\\" The Highlanders, with Doug suspended and Laflamme hospitalized, lose to the Shamrocks. The aging captain of the Highlanders, an inexperienced fighter, challenges Ross to a fight, Ross offering a chance to back out but the player denies it, and Ross easily defeats him. Doug reaches out to Laflamme and promises him he will always protect him on the ice; the incident touches Laflamme, who reconsiders his animosity towards Doug. In their next game, the Highlanders lead 1‚Äì0 thanks to strong teamwork between Doug and Laflamme. In the final seconds, Doug blocks a slapshot with his face and his ankle is injured in the ensuing scramble. Causing the Highlanders team to fight the other team at the end of the 3rd period. The Highlanders win, but need a win against Rhea and the Shamrocks in their last game for a playoff spot. Eva breaks up with her boyfriend to be with Doug, asserting that Doug is who she's really in love with. Doug later allows her now-ex-boyfriend to beat him up, believing that he deserves it for coming between them. After two periods, the Shamrocks are beating the Highlanders 2‚Äì0. Rhea and Doug mutually agree to fight in the third period. Although Rhea manages to knock him down when Doug re-breaks his recently injured ankle, Doug refuses to back down and eventually emerges victorious, knocking Rhea's tooth out. Ross smiles at seeing his tooth, satisfied that he lost to someone he considered a worthy opponent. Eva and his teammates help a seriously injured Doug off the ice and Laflamme, inspired by Rhea's defeat, scores a natural hat trick, giving the Highlanders a 3‚Äì2 lead. As the game enters its final minute, Eva comforts Doug in the locker room as he comments, \\"I think I nailed him.\\" Cast * Seann William Scott as Doug \\"The Thug\\" Glatt * Liev Schreiber as Ross \\"The Boss\\" Rhea * Alison Pill as Eva * Jay Baruchel as Pat * Marc-Andr√© Grondin as Xavier Laflamme * Eugene Levy as Dr. Glatt * David Paetkau as Ira Glatt * Kim Coates as Coach Ronnie Hortense * Richard Clarkin as Gord Ogilvey * Jonathan Cherry as Goalie Marco \\"Belchie\\" Belchior * Ricky Mabe as John Stevenson * Georges Laraque as Huntington * Curt Keilback as Rod McCaudry Production notes The film is an adaptation of the book Goon: The True Story of an Unlikely Journey into Minor League Hockey by Adam Frattasio and Doug Smith. Footage from Smith's career as an enforcer is shown during the film's credits, and Smith said in an interview with Grantland.com that he is happy with the finished film. The book was discovered by Jesse Shapira and his producing partner David Gross. Along with Baruchel and Goldberg, they developed the script and then proceeded to package and independently finance the movie. It was the first film under their No Trace Camping banner. Former NHL enforcer Georges Laraque has a small role as an enforcer for the Albany Patriots. His character fights both Glatt and Rhea over the course of the film. He draws with Glatt and the outcome of his fight with Rhea is not shown. When Laraque's character fights Glatt, the dialogue closely resembles the dialogue used by Georges Laraque in a fight against Raitis IvanƒÅns in December 2006. Goon was filmed in Brandon, Portage la Prairie and Winnipeg, Manitoba. Most of the hockey scenes were filmed at the Portage Credit Union Centre in Portage la Prairie, which substituted for the Halifax Metro Centre, the home arena for the Halifax Highlanders. Other scenes were filmed at the St. James Civic Centre in Winnipeg and Keystone Centre in Brandon. The MTS Centre was used for the home arena of the Quebec Victoires. The stick-swinging incident for which Rhea was suspended during the film's story bears a strong resemblance to an incident in the NHL when Marty McSorley of the Boston Bruins slashed Donald Brashear of the Vancouver Canucks in the head from behind on February 21, 2000. McSorley was suspended 23 games for the incident, which was extended to a full year after he was convicted of assault and sentenced to 18 months of probation. McSorley would never play another NHL game. Due to the slash and the fall on the ice, Brashear suffered a concussion, the same injury Laflamme suffered at the hands of Rhea in an unrelated incident. Another infamous NHL incident alluded to in the film is the Boston Bruins climbing into the stands and fighting the fans at Madison Square Garden on December 23, 1979. This was provoked by a Rangers fan who slapped Stan Jonathan hard enough with a rolled- up program to draw blood, and subsequently stole Jonathan's stick. Mike Milbury infamously beat a fan with the fan's own shoe. Milbury was suspended for six games for his involvement in the altercation. His teammates Terry O'Reilly and Peter McNab were suspended for eight and six games respectively. All of the Bruins players were also punished with $500 fines, while the fan was charged with disorderly conduct.Seminara, Dave. \\"Over The Glass and into Lore\\", The New York Times, Wednesday, December 23, 2009. It was also similar to an event in which a fan jumped into the penalty box with Tie Domi of the Toronto Maple Leafs on March 29, 2001. The teams Doug Glatt plays for over the course of the film both reference the Philadelphia Flyers, an NHL team that became infamous for physically intimidating their opponents during the 1970s. Glatt's home team, the Orangetown Assassins, wear a uniform similar to the ones the Flyers wore during the 1980s, including the orange and black color scheme; perhaps coincidentally, the logo strongly resembles that of the Philadelphia Arrows, a minor league team that preceded the Flyers. The Halifax Highlanders employ a logo that is structured as the letter H with a circle signifying a puck on the right and wings on the left side of the letter; the Flyers logo has a similar design but with the letter P. The Highlanders team colors and name, however, are similar to those of the New York Islanders. The scene in which Rhea becomes emotional during his suspension related press conference is a reference to former hockey forward and Vancouver Canuck Todd Bertuzzi. While playing for the Canucks, Bertuzzi punched Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche in the back of the neck, effectively ending his NHL career. Later during the press conference, Bertuzzi tearfully apologized for his actions that had him fined $500,000 and suspended for 17 months. Release A red-band trailer for the film was released on IGN. In Toronto and Montreal, prior to its premiere, posters for the film were removed from city bus shelters after several complaints from the public due to Baruchel making a \\"sexually suggestive gesture with his tongue and fingers.\\" The timing of the film's release was considered controversial by some as the previous summer featured the deaths of three NHL enforcers ‚Äì Derek Boogaard, Rick Rypien and Wade Belak ‚Äì all three of whom suffered from depression and head trauma that are believed to be factors in their deaths. Reception =Critical response= On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 81% based on 106 reviews, with an average rating of 6.5 out of 10. The website's critics consensus reads: \\"Goon is a crude slapstick comedy with well-formed characters and a surprising amount of heart.\\" On Metacritic the film has a score of 64 out of 100 based on reviews from 24 critics. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun- Times gave the film 3 out of 4 stars, and wrote: \\"The charm of Goon is that Doug Glatt (Scott) is a genial guy from a nice family. Just because he hands out concussions doesn't mean he dislikes anybody. He's just happy to be wearing a uniform. \\" Robert Koehler of Variety magazine praised the performances \\"The picture has a first-rate team of actors who visibly enjoy their roles and the sharp dialogue by Baruchel and Goldberg.\\" Stephen Holden, writing for The New York Times gave a positive review that credits all the major performances.\\"A Brawler with a Soft Side ‚ÄòGoon,‚Äô Directed by Michael Dowse\\", Stephen Holden, The New York Times, March 29, 2012 =Accolades= Goon was nominated for four awards at the 1st Canadian Screen Awards: Michael Dowse for Achievement In Direction, Jay Baruchel and Evan Goldberg for Best Adapted Screenplay, and Jay Baruchel and Kim Coates, both for Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role. Sequel Baruchel wrote a sequel with Jesse Chabot. Michael Dowse was slated to return to direct but it was Baruchel who directed the film, making it his directorial debut. Evan Goldberg produced the sequel. The title of the film is Goon: Last of the Enforcers. Baruchel expressed interest in the possibility of a third film, \\"I don‚Äô't want to get into trouble, and I'm not saying there's going to be a Goon 3,\\" Baruchel says, \\"but there's more than one way to skin a cat.

Some character biographies are also listed in articles relating to the organisations they belong to. For further Discworld character biographies, see the table below. Characters are listed alphabetically by name. 71-Hour Ahmed Achmed the Mad/Achmed the 'I Just Get These Headaches' Adora Belle Dearheart The daughter of Robert Dearheart, founder of the Grand Trunk Semaphore Company, and sister of the murdered John Dearheart, Adora Belle Dearheart (featured in Going Postal, Making Money and Raising Steam) is cynical, angry, and a heavy smoker (so memorably heavy that Moist, needing to find her, considered looking for a large plume of smoke coming from houses in the area, but ultimately asked a tobacconist), although it is also noted that she looks extremely good in a very plain gray dress. In the past, the conman Reacher Gilt had conned the Dearhearts out of their interest in the Trunk, which led to Miss Dearheart's having to take other employment. Previously, she worked in a bank. She lost her employment when Moist (before he knew her) conned the bank and got her fired. She later became involved in the Golem Trust. The trust is an employment service in Ankh-Morpork, owned by the Free Golems, that serves as a means to procure money to free more golems. During the events of Going Postal, she begins a tentative relationship with Moist von Lipwig, who is madly in love with her, mainly because she is the only person who does not easily fall for his tricks and is therefore a challenge. The fact that Lipwig helped return the clacks to the Dearhearts in a unique moment of selflessness has helped the relationship and by the time of Making Money they have become engaged. Miss Dearheart can see through most of Lipwig's tricks but he sometimes succeeds in amazing her. Of course in those cases he often succeeds in amazing himself as well. Moist's nickname for her is \\"Spike\\", no doubt a reference to her reaction when anyone thanks her politely for not smoking. (Miss Dearheart wears what she claims are \\"the pointiest heels in the world\\" and took ballet lessons in her youth. Such requests, or other unwelcome advances, are usually met by a demonstration of these facts.) The nickname given by her deceased brother was the more to the point: \\"Killer\\". By the events of Raising Steam (during which there is, incidentally, no reference to her smoking), Adora Belle and Moist have since married and now live in a mansion on Scoone Avenue, in Ankh (the same area where the Duke and Duchess of Ankh, Sam and Sybil Vimes, live). Whilst Moist continues to run both the Royal Ankh-Morpork Post Office and the Royal Mint and Bank, Adora Belle runs the Clacks and has made it an equal opportunities employer, also hiring golems and Goblins. In the TV adaptation of Going Postal, she was portrayed by Claire Foy. Bloody Stupid Johnson Bergholdt Stuttley 'Bloody Stupid' Johnson is an inept engineer and landscape artist, famous the Disc over for a single- minded approach to his crafts that can best be described as 'demented'. Where Leonard of Quirm makes absent-minded (and brilliantly inventive) doodles in the margins of his notebook, B.S. Johnson achieves the same effect by accident, and in the process creates some of the Disc's most impressive, dangerous, and unusual works of art, architecture, and engineering, such as the Johnson Exploding Pagoda and a chiming sundial that tends to explode every other day around noon. His most famous housing project, Empirical Crescent, tends to drive residents insane if they do not move out quickly or simply disappear. At the outset of the Discworld series, B.S. Johnson has long been deceased, but his architecture and other inventions remain. Brutha Brutha was a main character in Small Gods. At the beginning, he was a novice in Omnia, a religious land that believed in one god named Om. Brutha was completely faithful and would do practically anything for anyone as long as it did not include violence. Then he found a tortoise in his melon farming area. The tortoise was actually the great god Om. It turned out that Brutha was Om's only true believer. After a priest named Vorbis got the entirety of Omnia into the biggest mess, Brutha solved the conflict and became head priest of Omnia. At the end of Small Gods (in a flash-forward from the events of the book, when he is very old), Brutha dies. Canting Crew The 'Canting Crew' is an informal name for a group of Ankh-Morpork beggars who, being too anarchic for the Beggars' Guild, which tends to constrain them with rules, frequently beg from the Guild themselves, and often meet with success as they are heroes to certain guild members. Members of the group may often be found beneath Ankh- Morpork's Misbegot Bridge and they are frequently, though not always, accompanied by the talking dog Gaspode. They have also been accompanied by Death (in Soul Music) whom the group called (for reasons unknown) 'Mr Scrub'. Death's presence was described as enhancing the group's earning power and there is a pun when, on being given money, he is referred to as 'the Grateful Death'. =Foul Ole Ron= Excessively seedy, momentously dirty, overpoweringly smelly and entirely incomprehensible, Foul Ole Ron is the best- known member of the crew. He owns the world's only Thinking Brain Dog (as opposed to a \\"Seeing-eye dog\\"), Gaspode. Ron's smell has become strong enough to not only melt earwax but to acquire a separate existence. In fact, it outclasses him, and is usually referred to in text as being almost another character entirely, who occasionally arrives ahead of Ron, opts to stick around for a while after his departure, and even goes to upper-class parties without him. He is well known for his \\"catchphrase\\", \\"Buggrit, millennium hand an' shrimp...\\", which was the result of Pratchett feeding a random text generating program with a Chinese takeaway menu and the lyrics to They Might Be Giants' song Particle Man.APF Chapter 3: Discworld Annotations retrieved September 20, 2007 Another notable fact is that his catchphrase (minus \\"buggrit\\") is also used by Mrs Tachyon, a character in the Johnny Maxwell series, also by Pratchett. Foul Ole Ron is in one verse of Sam Vimes' 'City Version' of \\"Where's My Cow?\\". Young Sam enjoyed it, but Lady Sybil Vimes disapproved of this version. =Coffin Henry= Sometimes spelt 'Coughin' Henry'. He has a habitual cough, hence his name, the result of his continuous smoking habit, again, hence his name. His cough is described as sounding 'almost solid'. Like Ron, he appears as a verse in Where's My Cow?, when Sam adapts the Book's basic structure to fit city life. In it, Henry goes \\"Cough, gack, ptui\\". Unlike Ron, who asks people for money to stop him following them, Coffin Henry makes money by not going anywhere. People send him small sums so that he will not turn up at their parties and ask them to look at his interesting collection of skin diseases. He also wears a sign saying \\"For sum muny I wont follo yu hom\\". =Altogether Andrews= Altogether Andrews is a mass of multiple personalities (none of them named Andrews) in one mind, many of which are of considerably higher social status than him; these include Jossi, Lady Hermione, Little Sidney, Mr Viddle, Curly, the Judge, and Tinker; the eighth personality is simply known as Burke, who was only seen once by the canting crew (though not in any narrative), and they had no desire to ever see him again. The other seven personalities are very careful to keep him buried. The Duck Man speculates that Andrews was once a mild-mannered person of a psychic disposition who was mentally overwhelmed by the other souls. He is generally regarded as one of the most consistently sane of the group, as at least five of his personalities are capable of holding a sensible conversation with other people. His personalities 'voted' to decide whether to act as street vendors of The Ankh Morpork Times (in The Truth) and Andrews held up five fingers to indicate the outcome of his personalities' decision. =The Duck Man= The Duck Man is regarded as the intellectual of the group, and appears to be relatively sane. He is apparently unaware of the fact that he has a duck on his head, and has little memory of his life previous to joining the Canting Crew, referring to it only as \\"when I was someone else\\". He appears to have been rich and well educated at some time in the past, and even as a beggar, his clothes are the tattered remnants of an expensive suit. As a boy, he \\"messed around in boats\\".Pratchett, Terry. The Truth, p.240. Somebody apparently wants him dead, as the price on his head at The Assassins' Guild is $132,000.Discworld Assassins' Guild Yearbook and Diary 2000 Considering the fragile sanity of the Canting Crew, there's a chance he might have put that contract on himself before becoming a beggar. The Duck Man appears in several of Pratchett's books, including Hogfather, Soul Music , The Truth, and Feet of Clay. =Arnold Sideways= A member noted for being completely legless. Literally; a cart ran over his legs several years ago and he now gets around on a wheelbarrow, usually pushed by the Duck Man. He carries an old boot on a stick, so muggers desperate enough to try to rob the beggars often find themselves being kicked on the top of the head by a man 3 feet tall. Carcer The villain of Night Watch, described by Vimes as \\"a stone-cold killer. With brains\\". Carcer is said to have a talent for unnerving people, an annoying laugh (written as 'haha' in the book) and a perpetual conviction of his own innocence despite his many crimes, which include at least two murders. He claims his original crime was stealing a loaf of bread (a nod to the protagonist of Les Mis√©rables), though Vimes says that Carcer's style would be to murder the baker and steal the whole bakery. Carcer's full name was shown in a preview of Night Watch to be Carcer Dun, but this was never revealed in the completed book. His first name is also a Latin word meaning \\"prison\\". Carcer is captured by Vimes at the end of Night Watch.  Christine  A chorus singer at the Ankh-Morpork Opera House, Christine is a pretty, thin blonde with a tendency to wear white and use exclamation points at the end of every sentence. She is actually an extraordinarily untalented singer, but the management favors her for her beautiful appearance (and the fact her father has donated a good deal of money) and has her lip-synch on-stage to the voice of Agnes Nitt, otherwise known as Perdita Nitt. She is friendly and kind but not particularly bright and can be unintentionally slighting. She rarely pays attention to anyone but herself. She is a beneficiary of the sad fact that star quality is a far rarer commodity than talent. The \\"Phantom\\" in the story accidentally tutors Agnes instead of Christine when Christine runs away from the ghostly voice coming from her mirror. Agnes realizes what is happening and, in order to continue her training for a second night, she slips some herbs into Christine's hot milk to make her sleepy. Christine's father told her that a \\"dear little pixie\\" would help her career, and she thinks Agnes might be that pixie. Cohen the Barbarian Cohen the Barbarian was once a legendary hero, but is now in old age. Cohen uses this to his advantage, counting on the fact that his enemies will see an 'old barbarian hero' and fail to realize that being an old barbarian hero involves surviving long enough to become old. When he was first introduced in The Light Fantastic, he had lost all his teeth and speaks with a strong lisp, but he makes a set of dentures from the scattered pieces of diamond from a troll's tooth. At the end of the book, Cohen marries a young woman who is over a half-century younger than him. Conina The daughter of Cohen the Barbarian and a temple dancer. From her mother, she inherited gold-tinged skin, white-blond hair, a voice that can make \\"Good morning\\" sound like an invitation to bed, and a very good figure. From her father, she inherited sinews as strong as a mooring line, muscles as solid as a plank, and reflexes like a snake on a hot tin roof (from relevant pieces of description in Sourcery). She also acquired from Cohen suitable heroic instincts (that is, strong urges to fight, kill, and steal) and an ability to use anything as a deadly weapon. These traits rather get in the way of the profession she really wants to have: hairdressing. By the end of Sourcery, she had fallen in love with Nijel the Destroyer, who could be considered her polar opposite in that he wants to be a barbarian hero but is very bad at it. Corporal Strappi A character in Monstrous Regiment, Corporal Strappi is a thin, shouty soldier who loves to terrorize new recruits. Partway through Monstrous Regiment, Strappi disappears, stealing a lot of the Regiments's possessions. Sergeant Jackrum suspects all along that Corporal Strappi is not what he seems, and is right, because at the end of Monstrous Regiment, Corporal Strappi actually turns out to be Captain Strappi, a political through and through. Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler Claude Maximillian Overton Transpire Dibbler, usually known as Cut-Me-Own-Throat Dibbler, C.M.O.T. Dibbler, or simply Dibbler, is one of the numerous bit part characters in Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. Described as Discworld's most enterprisingly unsuccessful entrepreneur, a 'merchant venturer' in Ankh- Morpork, he is most famous for selling meat by-products to unsuspecting souls. His name originates from his catchphrase '... and at that price, I'm cutting me own throat.' He has also been a moving pictures (movie) producer/director where his lack of scruples was entirely reminiscent of the pioneers of modern motion pictures, similarly, the agent of a 'Music with Rocks In' group and the editor of the Ankh-Morpork Inquirer (a loss-making, tabloid newspaper run by the Guild of Engravers) where he fabricated stories. He sold strange green liquid made by monks living on a mountain according to an ancient recipe (Lance-Constable Carrot disputes this, but it turns out that it is actually true; however, the monks making the liquid for him have no idea what he does with it). He has also been known to sell 'fong shooey' advice, mail-order martial arts lessons (under the alias 'Grand Master Lobsang Dibbler'), 'Dibbler's Genuine Soggy Mountain Dew', souvenir snow-globes and advertising space in the Ankh-Morpork Times. In Men at Arms, he made a brief venture at selling food for trolls and later dwarfs. He is at his best selling intangibles; physical merchandise tends to hamper his patter somewhat. Indeed, he once said he was best at 'selling ideas.' Whenever anything physical is being sold, the claims made on his labels range from euphemisms to outright fabrications. As Nobby Nobbs put it after being told of the 'Soggy Mountain Dew' claim of '150% proof', \\"It ain't got no proof‚Äîjust circumstantial evidence.\\" When Dibbler's business plans fail, he falls back to selling (mostly) 'pies with personality' and 'pig' sausages-inna-bun on the streets of Ankh-Morpork. He has been accused of 'not being able to make both ends meat.' He is described in the books as resembling a rodent, and wears a long poacher's coat covered in pockets. He is usually seen either carrying a tray or pushing a barrow (in [financially] better times). This contains sausages- in-buns, meat pies, and probably some merchandise connected with whatever the latest Morporkian fad is, but only when other ideas have proven to be unsuccessful. His full name is mentioned in Making Money. His nickname was inadvertently suggested to him in Night Watch by the time traveling Samuel Vimes, who instantly rued it. This in itself is an ontological paradox (which was of course evened out by the history monks). The wizard Rincewind had a theory that equivalents of Dibbler are everywhere. This theory is borne out by the appearance of several versions of Dibbler throughout the Discworld series: *Solstice \\"Soll\\" Dibbler, Cut-Me-Own-Throat's nephew, who both worked together when making moving pictures (Moving Pictures); however, during production of the 'click' Blown Away, Soll stymies Dibbler's multiple attempts at product placement for Harga's House of Ribs in the film, including in dialogue, costumes, a firework display and even with footage of a plate of ribs being shown for five minutes in the middle of the 'click' in an attempt at subliminal messaging. *Disembowel-Meself-Honourably Dibhala sold suspiciously fresh thousand-year eggs in the Agatean Empire (Interesting Times). He discusses with Rincewind the possibilities of trade between Ankh-Morpork and the Empire. As tea and silk could be acquired from Klatch, Rincewind suggests the trade of gold, a rare metal in Ankh-Morpork but a ubiquitous one in the Empire. *Fair Go Dibbler sold the archetypal pie floaters on the lost continent of Fourecks (The Last Continent). *Cut-Me-Own-Hand-Off Dhblah sold disturbingly live yogurt in Omnia (Small Gods). In the Discworld II computer game, his name is spelt D'blah and he gives secrets about pyramid power in Djelibeybi. *Al-Jiblah, a merchant in Klatch (Jingo). *May-I-Never-Achieve- Enlightenment Dhiblang; mentioned in The Last Continent. *Dib Diblossonson sold topless-bottomless sm√∂rg√•sbord in the Hubland barbarian fjords. *May-I- Be-Kicked-In-My-Own-Ice-Hole Dibooki apparently only gathered whale meat after a conveniently beached whale had exploded into bite-sized chunks of its own accord. *Swallow-Me-Own-Blowdart Dhlang-Dhlang sold green beer, location unknown but suspected to be tropical rain forest, possibly Howondaland. *Point-Me-Own-Bone Dibjla, an Aboriginal Dibbler from Fourecks in the Discworld II PC game. Other Dibbler equivalents include Ratonasticthenes from Ephebe, mentioned in The Science of Discworld. It was previously thought they might all be related, but the Discworld Companion explains that this is parallel evolution. 'Wherever people are prepared to eat terrible food,' it says, 'there will be someone there to sell it to them.' Dibbler appeared in the Cosgrove Hall animations of Soul Music and Wyrd Sisters, in which his appearance seemed to be modelled on Private Joe Walker, the spiv in Dad's Army. He also appears in the Discworld computer game. He also appears in Discworld 2, along with many of the other Dibblers, including D'Blah and Point-Me-Own-Bone Dibjla (who is exclusive to the game). Additionally, in Discworld Noir, CMOT Dibbler is mentioned in the game on an Octarine Parrot bill and is said to be the one who gave Lewton his imp-powered coffee machine. A character named C!Mot is briefly mentioned in The Also People, a Doctor Who Virgin New Adventures novel by Ben Aaronovitch, running a T-shirt stall in the marketplace of Whynot. Aaronovitch has confirmed that C!Mot is intended as a parallel Dibbler, although how similar he is to the original (since the People have an entirely non-capitalist society) is unknown. A character called 'Clap- Me-In-Irons Daoibleagh' appears in the webcomic Rogues of Clwyd-Rhan. In Good Omens, after Crowley's Bentley bursts into flames over the M25 motorway a crowd gathers. There is also a man selling hot dogs, possibly a reference to Dibbler. The Cretaceous conifer species Sulcatocladus dibbleri is named after CMOT Dibbler.Watson, J., Lydon, S. J. and Harrison, N. A. (2001).\\"A revision of the English Wealden Flora, III: Czekanowskiales, Ginkgoales & allied Coniferales\\". Bulletin of the Natural History Museum (Geology Series), 57(1), 29-82. Daniel \\"One Drop\\" Trooper The Ankh-Morpork official Hangman and executioner, possibly its Chief Executioner, although others have not been specifically mentioned. Trooper is a specialist in the field of Death by Hanging, and it is his skill with a noose which allows him to simulate an actual execution but leave the victim alive which resulted in Moist von Lipwig's survival at the behest of Lord Vetinari. Where he learned his trade is not stated, perhaps trained by members of one or other of the Guilds, but the Patrician, himself trained at The Guild of Assassins is clearly impressed by Mr. Trooper's expertise. He supplements his official stipend, and plans for his retirement, by selling of short lengths of the hanging ropes used in particularly interesting cases‚Äîsuch as the \\"Albert Spangler\\" execution‚Äîoften signed by the victims themselves. Mr Trooper believes his work has value in terms of crime deterrence, based on the fact he never sees criminals more than once. Didactylos Meaning \\"Two-Fingered\\" in Ephebian, Didactylos is a philosopher, based on Diogenes of Sinope, who comes into the stories in Small Gods. He lives in a barrel inside the wall of the palace of the Tyrant in Ephebe, and lives off scraps. Although one of the most popular philosophers of all time, Didactylos never earns the respect of his fellow philosophers, due to the fact that he thinks 'about the wrong things'. He has been pictured with a lantern though blind and is looking for an \\"honest man\\". There is not much mention of Didactylos' life before the events of Small Gods, apart from the facts that he traveled a lot and advised some very important people in his life. The main mentions are of his journeys to Omnia (where he saw a person being stoned) and to Tsort (just before a revolution). It is also mentioned that he never went to Ankh-Morpork in his lifetime. He appears to be an homage to the famous cynic, Diogenes, who was similarly disliked by his contemporaries for focusing on the 'wrong questions'. Dios Doctor Cruces Doughnut Jimmy Universally known as Doughnut Jimmy, Dr James Folsom is a highly proficient horse doctor who was brought in, under threat of blackmail from Samuel Vimes, to treat Vetinari in Feet of Clay; this rather odd choice being the result of Vimes' knowledge that any human doctor would be contracted to guilds (who all resent Vetinari to varying degrees) and that horse doctors, treating animals worth considerable amounts of money, faced considerable amounts of trouble should their patients die. Due to his lack of experience with human patients, much of his advice was flawed (\\"walk him round a bit on loose rein...and no oats\\"). A former jockey, he won a lot of money by not winning races. Highly skilled at achieving results, when he treated the racehorse Dire Fortune, it did not fall over until the last furlong. A considerable testament to his skills, considering that the horse had, in fact, died coming up to the starting line. D'regs The D'regs are a nomadic and warlike people who inhabit the desert regions of hubward Klatch, in particular the lawless borderlands between Klatch proper and Hersheba. They will attack anyone, anything and even themselves. In their language, the word for \\"stranger\\" is the same as their word for \\"target\\". Nonetheless, in a tradition echoing the Afghan law of milmastia or the ancient Greek law of xenia, they will show a guest perfect hospitality for exactly 72 hours, whereupon killing him becomes an option. They can, however, toy with this rule; Samuel Vimes passed one of their many cultural \\"tests\\" by refusing to eat the sheep-eye soup traditionally offered foreigners to see if they'd go for it. Their most noted member is 71-Hour Ahmed, who gained his name for violating the ancient 3-day custom by executing a criminal one hour before it expired, an act so unthinkable that other D'regs call him the most feared man in all of Klatch. They have very strict ideas about women fighting: they expect them to be good at it. It is generally said that if a D'reg is one's friend he is one's friend for the rest of one's life, and if he is not one's friend the rest of one's life will be about five seconds; to still be alive five minutes after meeting a D'reg tribe is a clear indication that they really like one. Distrust is generally encouraged among the D'regs, with Ahmed once telling Vimes that his mother would be greatly offended if he trusted her on the grounds that she would feel she did not bring him up right. In Jingo, it's noted that \\"D'reg\\" is not actually their name for themselves, but a name given to them by others. It means \\"enemy\\" (in this case, everybody's) and the D'regs adopted it out of pride. Drum Billet The wizard who starts the events of Equal Rites by bequeathing his staff just before his death to, as he thinks, the eighth son of an eighth son, the child of the smith of the village of Bad Ass in Lancre. The midwife, Granny Weatherwax, tries to point out that they are making a mistake but Billet and the new father ignore her. As a result, the staff and its power are transferred to a girl: Eskarina Smith (\\"Esk\\"). Later in the book he has been reincarnated as an ant living under Unseen University. Edward d'Eath Ella Saturday The daughter of Baron Saturday of Genua and Mrs Erzulie Gogol. She appears in Witches Abroad as an attractive young woman with brown skin and blonde hair. Her entire life has been controlled by her fairy godmother, Lady Lilith de Tempscire, to ensure that she marries Lady Lilith's pawn, the Duc (pronounced \\"Duck\\") (actually a frog). She spends much of her time in the palace kitchens, apparently because she enjoys being helpful, rather than because she is mistreated. Because she helps lay the fires, the palace cook nicknamed her \\"Embers\\" (she is, of course, the Discworld version of Cinderella, although the full nickname \\"Emberella\\" is referred to as sounding \\"like something you'd put up in the rain\\"). At the end of Witches Abroad, she became the Baroness of Genua. Eric Thursley A thirteen-year- old demonologist and title character in Eric. He lives at 13 Midden Lane, Pseudopolis. Eric inherited most of his demonology books and paraphernalia (as well as a talking parrot) from his grandfather; his parents, apparently convinced that their son was destined to become a gifted demonologist, allowed him free rein over his grandfather's workshop. Eric was relatively unsuccessful as a demonologist until, with some unknown assistance, he managed to summon Rincewind from the Dungeon Dimensions. After a journey across Time to such diverse locations as the Discworld rainforests, the Tsortean War, and the beginning of the universe (during which he became somewhat more likeable), Eric was last seen escaping from Hell with Rincewind, and it is unknown what happened to him afterwards. Eskarina Smith Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre Daughter of King Verence II of Lancre and Queen Magrat, Princess Esme made her debut as a newborn in Carpe Jugulum, where she is about to be taken for her Christening. Her unusual middle names are the result of a Lancre tradition that whatever the priest says at the naming ceremony is your name (thus, Lancre once had a king called My-God-He's-Heavy the First, as well as a current farmer named James What the Hell's That Cow Doing in Here Poorchick, usually called 'Moocow'). Magrat‚Äîwho owed her own name to a combination of this tradition and her mother's inability to spell \\"Margaret\\"‚Äîwas determined it would not happen again, hence the \\"Note Spelling\\". Evadne Cake Findthee Swing Captain Swing is the head of the Unmentionables in the Ankh-Morpork of the past in Night Watch. Swing is mainly remembered for his attempt to control crime by ordering all weapons confiscated, reasoning that this would result in a decline in crime figures, failing to acknowledge that criminals do not obey the law in the first place and would actually greatly enjoy the lack of weapons in society. He is described as a thin, balding man dressed in a long, old-fashioned black coat with large pockets, and supports himself on an opera cane (which is in reality a swordstick, albeit a poorly concealed one). Swing moves and speaks in an erratic, jumpy fashion, in bursts and sputters, rather than a continuous flow of movement or sound. He is, however, a skilled swordsman, as he does not resort to flashy swashbuckling, but instead actually attacks his opponent. Swing always carries with him a large set of calipers and a steel ruler, with which he measures the facial characteristics of people he meets in order to determine their personal traits (phrenology). Its reliability is questionable; according to it, Vimes has the eye of a mass murderer (Vimes says he indeed does... in his other suit) while Carcer's only problem was his environment (most likely all the dead bodies wherever he went). He is killed by Vimes during the fire at the Unmentionables' headquarters. On arriving at the Great Desert he tries to use his phrenological skills to determine Death's character, only to find that Death has no characteristics he can measure. The name Captain Swing has long been associated with civil unrest, being the pseudonym of the (possibly mythical) leader of the Swing Riots. Glenda Sugarbean A plump, over-breasted girl who runs the Night Kitchen in the Unseen University until the events of Unseen Academicals. The granddaughter of the chief cook at the Assassin's Guild, she has inherited a large number of secret recipes from her. Having spent most of her life forced to do other people's thinking for them, she is overwhelmed with uncertainty when her dim- witted best friend, Juliet, suddenly gains the opportunity to be a supermodel. Initially cautious, she eventually relents and allows Juliet follow her dream. In a similar vein, she, against her own better judgement, allows herself to be swept off her feet by an unlikely romance with a savant orc, Mr. Nutt, and eventually goes on an adventure with him into Uberwald. Lord Sir Harry King One of Ankh-Morpork's most successful businessmen, Harry King appears in The Truth, Making Money, and Raising Steam, and is referred to in Going Postal and briefly in Night Watch by Lu Tze. He started out as a mudlark, and developed his career from there. His core business is that of \\"night soil\\" removal, but he is also involved in general rubbish collection and recycling. His basic philosophy is that there is nothing that someone will pay to have removed that someone else will not pay to acquire. The sign outside his yard reads \\"King of the Golden River, Recycling Nature's Bounty.\\" This replaces, at his wife's insistence, the original: \\"H. King, taking the piss since 1961.\\" His wife's name is Euphemia \\"Effie\\" King (his petname for her is \\"Duchess\\"), and their daughters are Daphne and Herminone (through whom Harry King is also a grandfather). The moniker, \\"King of the Golden River,\\" is unlikely to be a reference to the River Ankh, which is brown due to centuries of waste being dumped into it, but is more likely to be a scatological reference, as suggested by the previous sign. It may also be a reference to the classic fairy tale of the same name written in 1842 by John Ruskin, particularly considering that the Ruskin work is written for Euphemia \\"Effie\\" Gray (compare Harry King's wife), and also possibly a play on the mystical \\"King of the Silver River\\" character who appears in the Tolkien-derived fantasy Shannara series by American writer Terry Brooks. Of note is the fact that Harry King employs most of the gnolls in the city (a race that spends all their time picking up trash,) never forgets a debtor and needs to take two baths just to elevate himself to the rank of dirty. One of his little fingers is missing. Harry keeps ferocious mongrel guard dogs on his property. He would not 'buy posh foreign dogs when he can buy the crossbreeds'. Moist von Lipwig mistakes the dogs for pedigree Lipwigzers (probably Discworld Rottweilers, although Rottweilers are referred to as themselves in Carpe Jugulum,) a particularly savage breed of dog, but one which, as a Lipwig, he is familiar with, and is quite intrigued to find that the commands used to discipline lipwigzers still work on them (though they may have only been responding to the tone and confidence shown by Moist). Harry prefers it when burglars break in, so that he does not have to feed the dogs. In Snuff, it is revealed that Harry King has since been given a Knighthood. In Raising Steam, swayed by the new steam engine by Dick Simnel (who becomes romantically involved with Harry King's favorite niece, Emily King), Harry provides the capital to build the \\"Ankh- Morpork and Sto Plains Hygienic Railway\\", and at the end of the book is given a peerage. Herrena, the Henna-haired Harridan Her name says it all really, an ex-opponent of Cohen, and sometime lover. Ofttimes beset by other barbarians, and even more often tearing across the Disc-scape as an aside. Inspired by Red Sonja of Conan fame. She has a prominent role in The Light Fantastic and a small cameo in Eric. Hodgesaargh Castle falconer at Lancre, Hodgesaargh is not his actual name, but some misunderstanding has been caused due to his birds' habit of attacking him when people speak to him (i.e. \\"Hello, my name is Hodges...ARRRRRGH\\"). He survives a direct elvish invasion of the Lancre castle, mainly due to one of his birds attacking the elf. His ceremonial outfit of red and gold with a big floppy hat is usually supplemented with about three sticking plasters. One of the birds he breeds is the wowhawk, or Lappet-faced Worrier, which is like a goshawk only more so‚Äîit prefers to walk everywhere and faints at the sight of blood. In the book Carpe Jugulum he is responsible for discovering the phoenix. In the same book, he assists Granny Weatherwax in recovering from a vampire attack, though he clearly understood his life was in danger at that point. Hodgesaargh is based on a real-life keeper of birds of prey named Dave Hodges, who lives in Northamptonshire. He is also the author of The Arts of Falconrie and Hawking. Hrun the Barbarian Appeared in The Colour of Magic. Hrun is an archetypal fantasy barbarian: hulking and musclebound yet slow-witted, with very little dress sense, battle-prone, alcoholic and fond of virgins. Hrun owns a magic talking sword, Kring, which he stole following a battle, and lived to greatly regret it due to the sword's talkativeness. He meets Rincewind in Bel Shamharoth's lair, and aids his escape. Upon nearing the Wyrmberg of the Dragonriders, he is captured by the curvaceous Liessa Dragonbidder and her dragon riders. Liessa's plan was to use Hrun to wrest the rulership of the Wyrmberg from her rival brothers and then become queen, Hrun's payment being her hand in marriage. Hrun agrees to the plan and successfully defeats Liessa's brothers with his bare hands, but he refuses to kill them as they are unconscious. Killing unconscious people would have been damaging to his reputation. Liessa agrees to resort to banishing her brothers. In a scene unusually erotic for a Discworld book, Liessa strips naked before Hrun to see if his desire for her will be strong enough for their relationship to work. Before he can accept the \\"proposal\\", Rincewind and Twoflower riding upon Twoflower's conjured dragon Ninereeds, snatch up Hrun in a rescue attempt and fly away with him. Hrun is extremely displeased at the event, having been denied both lordship and intimate contact with Liessa through their actions. But Hrun does not need to be angry for long: when Twoflower faints, his dragon, having existed only through his willpower, disappears, causing all three passengers to fall through the air. Liessa catches Hrun on her own dragon, and the couple share a passionate kiss. Hrun's fate after this is unknown. In Interesting Times, it is revealed that he eventually became the commander of the Watch in an unnamed city. This could also imply that Hrun eventually split up with Liessa. Hrun's separation from Liessa and his enrolment in a Watch unit are not altogether surprising: late on in the Discworld timeline, barbarians and mythical creatures are dying out due to the modernisation of the world, leading them to either fade from existence or have to enroll into society. Hrun also has some fame, because Twoflower gets very excited at the prospect of meeting Hrun the Barbarian. Hubert Turvy Imp Y Celyn A bard from the decidedly Cymric country of Llamedos. In Soul Music he is possessed by \\"Music with Rocks in\\" and becomes the Disc's greatest musician under the name Buddy in the Band with Rocks In along with Cliff and Glod, before dying in a cart crash (a reference to Buddy Holly‚ÄîImp's name translates as \\"bud of the holly\\". Celyn is Welsh for Holly). The timeline in which this happened has, however, been eradicated following Death's intervention, and he was last seen working in a fried fish stall in Quirm, a clear reference to Kirsty MacColl's song \\"There's a Guy Works Down the Chip Shop Swears He's Elvis\\". During the novel several characters comment that he seems a bit \\"elvish\\" (also a reference to the same Kirsty MacColl song). In the animated adaptation of the novel, Imp was voiced by Andy Hockley, and his final fate is changed to working as a gardener at Susan's school; their interactions are rewritten throughout the adaptation to imply a developing romantic relationship. Miss Iodine Maccalariat A receptionist whose voice recalls the worst of schoolteachers. Her family have performed this role for generations, and suck lemons until their features are pursed enough. She appears in Going Postal. Jeremy Clockson J.H.C. Goatberger Publisher in Ankh-Morpork. Books published by his company include The Joye of Snacks by A Lancre Witch and the Ankh-Morpork Almanack. Mr Goatberger knows his readership well, and prints his Almanacks on thin paper, as many families use previous editions in their privies. He appears in Maskerade, where he makes a great deal of money out of Nanny's book, and is surprised she wants some of it. He also has a sort of appearance in Nanny Ogg's Cookbook, in the form of a series of memos drawn to appear pinned to some of the pages. These form a discussion between him and the head printer, Thomas Cropper, about the book. After previous experience with Nanny Ogg's writing he is anxious to avoid innuendo, but is not entirely successful. His nephew has a similar exchange with Cropper in the pages of The Discworld Almanak. His name is a play on Johann Gutenberg, with his first initials apparently derived from a phrase referring to Jesus Christ. John \\"Mossy\\" Lawn A doctor in Ankh-Morpork. He first appeared in Night Watch, as a backstreet \\"pox doctor\\", offering medical assistance to \\"seamstresses\\". He had trained in Klatch, where he had learnt techniques other Morporkian surgeons distrusted, but which kept patients alive for longer than it took to pay the bill. He also gave free treatment to those who needed it, including those who had been tortured by the Cable Street Particulars. He is quiet (if a tad sarcastic) and almost unshockable. Following his successful delivery of Young Sam, Samuel Vimes gave him a large area of land in the Goosegate area of the city. In Going Postal this is the Lady Sybil Free Hospital. Dr Lawn's preferred method of dealing with the nursing staff is to throw a handful of chocolates in one direction and run in the other as fast as possible. He claims that, when he dies, he wants a bell left on his gravestone so he can have the pleasure of not getting up when people ring. Dr. Lawn is based on an actual retired GP of the same name based in West Yorkshire. Jonathan Teatime Juliet Stollop Featuring in Unseen Academicals, Stollop is a stunningly beautiful and utterly empty-headed girl who becomes a society sensation overnight when offered the possibility to become a supermodel. Scion of a family of football hooligans, she breaks generations of convention by falling in love with Trevor Likely, who supports an opposing team. Eventually, Trev joins the newly formed footballing league, and Juliet embarks on a new life as a WAG and fashion model. Lavaeolus The Discworld equivalent of Odysseus. He was the finest military mind on the continent of Klatch. His genius consisted of realising that, if there has to be a war, the aim should be to defeat the enemy as quickly and with as little bloodshed as possible--a concept so breathtaking in its originality that few other military minds have been able to grasp it, and it shows what happens when one takes the conduct of a war away from skilled soldiers. He was a hero of the Tsortean Wars, which he ended by bribing a cleaner to show him a secret passage into the citadel of Tsort. He is also known for having undergone a long and perilous journey home after the war, much like his Roundworld equivalent. It is possible that he is the ancestor of Rincewind as his name means \\"rinser of winds\\". He appeared in Eric and is briefly mentioned in Pyramids. Leonard of Quirm Lewton Lewton appears in the third Discworld computer game, Discworld Noir. Lewton is the Disc's first and only private investigator and a former member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, having been banished from it for taking a bribe. Lewton was once a member of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch (sometime before the books). Commander Sam Vimes had a particular unexplained grudge against him. Lewton met and fell in love with a female archaeologist named Ilsa and seemed to have a happy life; a particular moment fondly remembered was the Hotel Pseudopolis. Life seemed to be going well for Lewton. However, one day, Ilsa left Ankh-Morpork for unexplained reasons and this drew Lewton into a depression. He spent countless days drinking and drinking. During these hard times, Lewton took a bribe which ended in him being permanently excluded from the Watch. A few years later, Lewton decided to pick himself up, forget about Ilsa and the rest of his past and start a new life. He became a Private Investigator. However, he rarely got any cases. When Carlotta Von Uberwald came into his life, Lewton's life changed forever. She gave him the Mundy Case and although Lewton did not know it, she used him as a puppet in order to find Mundy (of whom she said was her lover but he was really an informant for her cult). After discovering this they argued, and during this argument Carlotta kissed and bit Lewton, turning him into a werewolf (or some variant type, several of which are named/referenced in the books themselves). Using his new wolf abilities, Lewton managed to put a stop to Carlotta's cult's plans and save Ankh-Morpork from being consumed by a giant god of destruction. Lieutenant Blouse A significant character in Monstrous Regiment, he is Polly Perks' platoon commander. A rather effeminate aristocrat, he previously worked in the Quartermaster-General's Blanket, Bedding and Horse Fodder Department as an administrator, and had no previous experience of field command. He has a remarkable talent for mathematics and technology. Ironically, despite his rather feminine manner and distinct lack of martial prowess (the expression \\"a big girl's blouse\\" is British slang for a wimp), he turns out to be one of the few characters in the novel who is genuinely male. Despite this, he respects and admires the women when he learns the truth, informing their captors that \\"[he] would not trade them for any six men [they] offered [him]\\". Blouse's ambition is to have an item of clothing or a food named after him, in the manner of many famous military men. Eventually a type of fingerless glove is named for him. Blouse seems to be a direct contrast to Jackrum- the small, skinny, naive man is brilliant with numbers, and in one notable scene, thinks faster than Jackrum and uses a signaling device to misdirect enemy forces, whereas Jackrum would have simply smashed the device and moved on; a sign of warfare on the Discworld changing, with intelligence and technology beginning to take the place of bravery and fighting skill. Liessa Dragonlady Daughter of Geicha the First, lord of the Wyrmberg, and leader of the dragonriders. An archetypal fantasy barbarian woman (as well as an affectionate parody of the late Anne McCaffery's Dragonriders of Pern series), she has red chestnut hair, is curvaceous and wears almost nothing except for a chainmail harness. Liessa's ambitions are high: having poisoned her father, the traditional means of succession in her family, she is hindered by the fact that as a woman, she cannot become lord of the Wyrmberg and faces intense rivalry from her two brothers. There is however a loophole: by marrying a man who would then become lord of the Wyrmberg through allegiance, she could act as the real power behind the throne. When she foments this plan, Rincewind, Twoflower and Hrun the Barbarian are passing close to her mountain country. Liessa is interested in Hrun, for as a strong but slow-witted warrior, she could use him to defeat her brothers and then place him as a puppet lord. Having kidnapped Hrun and Twoflower (for whom she expresses no interest and has locked away), she tests Hrun by trying to stab him in his sleep. Hrun grabs her wrist and almost breaks it. Convinced of the fellow barbarian's agility, she tells him that he may marry her if he defeats her brothers. Hrun accepts and succeeds in carrying out her orders, but refuses to definitely kill her siblings. Liessa agrees to banishing them instead and tells Hrun tenderly (calling him by name for the first time) that she did not expect such mercy from him. It seems at that point that Liessa is developing genuine feelings for her husband-to-be. But Liessa still has one more trial in store for him: she strips till she is naked, so as to see how much passion he truly has for her. Before the couple can embark onto anything intimate however, Hrun is snatched away by Rincewind and Twoflower riding Twoflower's dragon Ninereeds. In desperation, Liessa summons her own dragon to pursue them (still naked, as Pratchett makes a point of). Ninereeds nearly outruns her but vanishes when Twoflower loses consciousness, causing everyone riding him to fall. Liessa abandons Rincewind and Twoflower to their fate and catches Hrun on her dragon, and the two share a passionate kiss. Liessa is never seen or mentioned after this. Since Hrun is mentioned to have joined the Watch in Interesting Times, she and Hrun may have split up, or she herself is now part of the Watch, though the latter seems improbable. Liessa's kingdom is not likely to have survived, for by the later books, the barbarian way of life has all but vanished from the Discworld. She appears in The Colour of Magic. In the Easter 2008 Sky One adaptation of The Colour of Magic, she is played by Karen David. Lobsang Ludd Lobsang (born Newgate Ludd) was raised by the Ankh-Morpork Thieves' Guild, but was discovered by Soto of the History Monks when Lobsang performed the Stance of the Coyote (the effect is not fully explained, though it is presumably a reference to Wile E. Coyote's ability to pause in mid-air for comic effect) in order to save his own life after falling from a rooftop, which would have killed him. Afterwards he was sent to and raised in the Temple, where he confounded his teachers by knowing too much, but not knowing how he knows it, and even then not knowing that he knows it till he is asked the specific question. Eventually he was apprenticed to Lu- Tze after his teachers were unable to teach him. This move was not entirely in Lobsang's best interests‚Äîdue to internal politics, it was hoped they would \\"break\\" each other. Lu-Tze theorised that time's hold on him was \\"loose\\", for example, Lobsang could demonstrate a negative reaction time‚Äîmoving towards something before it starts moving, though this theory eventually proved to be wrong. During this time he showed several unique powers, being able to sense the direction of a time disturbance, balancing the \\"load\\" of time down to less than a second after a Time Crash (which a man with 50,000 years experience claims he could not even hope to do) and reacting to (and being reacted to by) the Mandala, a visual display of Time on the Disk. After the time crash he goes out into the world to stop the second Glass Clock (under the pretext of being shown the Way of Mrs Cosmopilite), which was being constructed by his then unknown temporal double, Jeremy Clockson. It is revealed after time stops that he can make his own time, and pairs up with Susan Sto Helit to stop the Clock. He finds out about his \\"brother\\" (who is actually him, just having led a different life and born a second after him) and after touching him, they combine, and it is revealed that he is the son of Wen the Eternally Surprised and the personification of Time. After fusing with Jeremy, Lobsang inherited all of Time's powers (though due to his inexperience he needs \\"time\\" to recharge them initially) and eventually takes over her role. Due to his nature, even before this, Death could not see him, as he lies outside of Death's influence. At the end of Thief of Time he shares an unspecified \\"perfect moment\\" with Susan Sto Helit (a.k.a. Susan Death), who is also a human who inherited qualities from an anthropomorphic personification. Lobsang inherited powers directly from his parent; she, indirectly from a foster grandparent (Death). However, unlike Susan, who is mostly human, Lobsang is \\"mostly not\\" human‚Äîhe has the mindset and \\"infuriating smile\\" of a God, and thinks in 18 dimensions‚Äîhe claims that even seeing in only 4 is hard, making it difficult to maintain corporeal form. His incarnation of Jeremy had romantic inclinations to Myria LeJean, the first embodied Auditor, who shared the feeling but was not able to express it, due firstly to Jeremy's nullification and secondly due to her committing suicide via 10,000-gallon vat of chocolate at the end of Thief of Time. Lord Downey Lord Snapcase The Patrician who came to power after Lord Winder. Also known as Mad or Psychoneurotic Lord Snapcase. During his reign, he was considered \\"eccentric\\" rather than mad by the upper classes, but he is now known by most Morporkians, including the nobles, as the Mad Lord. He was sadistic, and extremely fond of torture, much like his predecessor. Lord Snapcase was succeeded by Lord Havelock Vetinari. There are very few historical records of Lord Snapcase's tyranny. This may be because of Snapcase's mental disorder, which caused him to be very secretive while trying to spy on everyone else. His obsession with his own security left him no time to govern or affect history. His one recorded act was to direct the Assassins' Guild to 'inhume' the tourist Twoflower at the request of the Agatean Empire; the attempt failed (The Colour of Magic). His overthrow apparently occurred in a spontaneous uprising caused by years of cruelty and hardship shortly after he made somebody eat his own nose (Interesting Times). Following this rebellion, he was hung up by his 'figgin'. Lord Vetinari's rise to power is still undocumented. Lord Winder Patrician of Ankh-Morpork, and predecessor to Mad Lord Snapcase. Also known as Homicidal Lord Winder. During the last years of his reign, he was extremely paranoid, albeit with good reason. He took pride in being pathologically careful about everything, running Ankh-Morpork as a police state, with his dreaded Cable Street Particulars, under the command of Captain Swing, causing dissidents to disappear. He was deposed as a result of the Glorious Revolution of the Twenty-Fifth of May, during which he was very nearly assassinated by the future Lord Vetinari, but died out of sheer terror instead when Vetinari, dressed all in black, walked up to him in a room full of people, none of them noticing anything. Because their code demands it, assassins have to tell their victim their name and who sent them--Vetinari answered \\"think of me as your future\\" and \\"the city\\" respectively (indicating that Vetinari already planned to become Patrician some day). Lupine Wonse Former childhood friend to Samuel Vimes and later secretary to Lord Vetinari. As the Grand Master of the Elucidated Brethren of the Ebon Night, he summoned a dragon intending it to be killed by a king, whom he would then control. This failed and he found himself personal assistant to the Dragon King in Guards! Guards!. Following a confrontation with the City Watch, he was killed by a metaphor, or possibly the ground, after then-Constable Carrot Ironfoundersson literally \\"threw the book at him\\" and sent him stumbling past a missing wall on an upper floor of the Patrician's palace and down to the floor below. Lu Tze Lu-Tze first appeared in the novel Small Gods as a minor character. His name is an allusion to the Chinese legendary figure Lao-Tze, the sage to whom the Tao Te Ching is attributed. He is one of the History Monks and spends much of the novel in the background, disguised as a simple sweeper. He also deliberately changes the course of history because he did not like the way things \\"should\\" go, replacing a horrific war with a century of peace. Lu-Tze has a more substantial role in Thief of Time, in which we learn that he is not a monk at all, but \\"merely\\" a sweeper at the Monastery of Oi-Dong. The lack of a formal title, in fact, gives him fewer restrictions than his contemporaries. In fact, he uses the same trick (that no-one notices a sweeper) in the monastery as he does when out in the world, and has learnt as much about the nature of time as some of the higher monks simply by tidying up the classrooms. Everyone knows Lu-Tze's name as one of the best monks on the field, but few realise who he actually is. He is generally referred to just as \\"Sweeper\\". This is in part a reference to Martin, the pessimist philosopher and sweeper in Voltaire's Candide. He is very good at martial arts when he needs to be and is the only known master of \\"D√©j√† fu\\", in which the hands move in time as well as space. This is best described as 'the feeling you've been kicked in the head this way before'. Generally he relies on the fact that no-one notices a sweeper, a well-honed ability to talk his way out of anything, and \\"Rule One\\", which states \\"Do not act incautiously when confronting little bald wrinkly smiling men\\", since such a person is almost always a highly trained martial artist due to the Disc's law of narrative causality. It is the opinion of many that Lu- Tze uses Rule One to bluff his way out of trouble, but, if necessary, he can prove it's no bluff. He does this towards the end of Thief of Time by defeating Lobsang Ludd (then incarnated as the personification of Time) in a fair fight, in front of a crowd of higher monks. As he said, \\"Def'nitely give the ol' Rule One a fillip.\\" Lu-Tze also appears in Night Watch, Unseen Academicals, and Raising Steam in a small‚Äîbut significant‚Äîrole. A sweeper is also referenced in The Fifth Elephant and Going Postal. He is a devout follower of The Way of Mrs. Cosmopilite, a way of life of his own devising which he created after lodging with Marietta Cosmopilite in Ankh-Morpork, some of which is explained in more detail in Lu-Tze's Yearbook of Enlightenment. Ly Tin Wheedle Ly is arguably the greatest philosopher on the Disc, although he is usually the one arguing for this. He comes from the Counterweight Continent, home of Rincewind's friend Twoflower. In his home country he is regarded as a great sage because of his peculiar smell, and his many sayings advocating respect for the old and the virtues of poverty are frequently quoted by the rich and elderly. He is first mentioned in The Colour of Magic. In addition to social philosophy, Ly is also a proponent of natural philosophy. When the philosophical community came to the conclusion that distance was an illusion and all places were in fact the same place, Ly was the philosopher to make the famed conclusion that although all places were in fact the same place, that place was very big. He has also theorised on the physical underpinnings of monarchy, explaining royal succession by use of a particle known as a Kingon (or possibly Queon). Magrat Garlick : See Magrat Garlick Marietta Cosmopilite Mrs Marietta Cosmopilite is a dressmaker, who appears in Moving Pictures as Vice President of Costuming and Theda Withel's landlady. Earlier in the book she is mentioned as being capable of believing the Disc is under threat from inhuman monsters, that she is a subject of derision for believing that the world is round, and that three dwarfs look in on her undressing. She is correct about the inhuman monsters and the dwarfs (although she is never told about the first one and the second is \\"only by coincidence\\"). She is noted as having (appropriate to her name) what would be seen as a contemporary view of the world. Theda claims Mrs. Cosmopilite would not mind Victor Tugelbend coming with her up to her room‚Äîassuming they would be going up for sex, but they had a different reason. She is briefly mentioned in Witches Abroad as being venerated by some younger Ramtops monks who, on the basis that wisdom seems wiser if it comes from further away, trek down to Ankh-Morpork to hear her wisdom. This is usually \\"bugger off\\" or something similar, but since the monks do not speak Morporkian, it does not matter much. In Thief of Time it turns out that this was started by Lu-Tze, who spent some time lodging with her, and has a much better understanding of the Way of Mrs Cosmopilite than the monks who followed; he wrote down many of her sayings as guides by which to live his life. Most have double meanings, serving as both stereotypical utterances of a grouchy older working-class woman, and equally stereotypical pieces of oriental wisdom. The most notable is perhaps \\"I wasn't born yesterday\\" which, as Lu Tze points out, resembles one of the key revelations of Wen the Eternally Surprised, who, in reference to the continually destroyed and renewed nature of the universe, and the constancy of revelation, said \\"Yesterday, I was not born\\". Mavolio Bent Mr Mavolio Bent is the Head Cashier and all but in charge of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork. He is first introduced to the discworld series in the book Making Money. He has been in employment at the bank since he was thirteen, when he came to the city with a group of travelling accountants. He was born as a clown (Charlie Benito), but his first time performing was severely affected by the audience laughing at him. He fled the show, and he happened upon a group of travelling accountants, and discovered his talent for numbers. From then on, he renounced his clowning heritage, and went to work at the bank. Mr Bent eventually accepts his clown heritage after having a mental breakdown because (among other things) he made his first mathematical mistake. It appears that he remains at the bank, though. In an attempt to honour his clown heritage, he returns to work wearing a red nose. Mr Bent resided in Mrs. Cake's Boarding House. This has likely changed since marrying a 'Miss Drapes' (although she is presumably now Mrs Bent) at the Fool's Guild Chapel of Fun by Reverend Brother \\"Whacko\\" Whopply, in a 'whitewash wedding'. Mightily Oats Mr Hong Mr Hong never appears in any of the books, having (apparently) died before the start of any of the stories, but appears to form an important part of Ankh-Morpork's collective memory. In several Discworld books, a character is admonished to \\"remember what happened to Mr Hong when he tried to open the Three Jolly Luck Takeaway Fish Bar on the site of the old fish god temple in Dagon Street on the night of the full moon.\\" This incident appears to act as a deterrent for Morporkians against meddling with the occult or supernatural or doing something that is patently stupid. Though it is never satisfactorily explained exactly what happened, in Jingo it is revealed that only his kidney and a few bones were found; in the game Discworld Noir his shop was used as a location for one of the murders. Found boarded up, deep investigation reveals that a local thespian from the Dysk theatre was eaten there. Mr Pin Mr Pin is the brains of the New Firm, a duo of interloping criminals in The Truth. In general Mr Pin makes the plans and decides where they are going to go and what they are going to do, but he is open to suggestions from his partner. Both men can become violent, but Mr Pin's violence is more directed and instrumental. The background of Mr Pin is much more vague than his partner, Mr Tulip. He comes to a rather sticky end when he is impaled by the desk spike of William de Worde in the offices of The Ankh-Morpork Times after being trapped in a cellar with molten lead raining from the ceiling as the building burned. Mr Pin is then reincarnated into a potato and deep fried. Mr Pin and Mr Tulip are very similar in many respects to Mr. Croup and Mr. Vandemar, a violent duo in Neverwhere, written by Neil Gaiman. The two authors have collaborated before in Good Omens, and sometimes make reference to each other's works. However, Pratchett has denied any conscious reference in this case.Annotated Pratchett File: Annotations for The Truth It is possible that Mr Pin and Mr Tulip are taken as analogues of the Marvel Comics characters, the Kingpin and the Rose, organised crime figures. Mr Salzella The Director of Music at the Ankh- Morpork Opera House in Maskerade, most notable for an absolute hatred of opera. He embezzles money and murders the people who find out, blaming the murders on the Opera Ghost. Salzella is eventually found out and proves to be just as \\"infected\\" with operatic romanticism as everyone else in the building. Due to the Discworld's rather literal adherence to the laws of narrative convention, this is not an entirely mental issue: He is killed in an extremely operatic duel with the Ghost and spends two pages on a final monologue before keeling over. He only had a sword theatrically thrust under his armpit, but according to the witches present, failed to notice this. Mr Slant Mr Slant is the president of the Guild of Lawyers, a position that he has held for a long time due to being a zombie. He is also one of the three founders of Morecombe, Slant, and Honeyplace, Ankh Morpork's leading legal practice. Considering that Mr Slant is a zombie and both Mr Morecombe and Honeyplace are vampires, they are old enough to have been around when many laws were first written up. Promotion is also an unlikely prospect in the firm. He is the undisputed head of any legal action in the city and is one of major members of the civil council. However, Mr Slant has also been involved in more sinister affairs. He has attempted to aid in deposing Lord Vetinari from power several times, but only through serving other clients and not from an actual desire of his own to depose of Vetinari. He became a zombie after having been convicted of a crime and decapitated but, since he defended himself, refuses to pass on until his descendants pay the legal fees. Mr Tulip Mr Tulip is, along with Mr Pin, a member of the New Firm, a duo of interloping criminals in The Truth. He is something of a contradiction: a remorseless killer with the refined soul of a true fine-art connoisseur. He is differentiated from a common criminal by his habit of removing works of art from houses before committing arson, the ability to distinguish between priceless works of art and common forgeries, and an encyclopaedic knowledge of hundreds of years of great artists, artisans and their works. He is the muscle of the New Firm, and though an instinctive killer, recognises Mr Pin's cognitive skills, and leaves the thinking to him. He also suffers a mild speech impediment, causing him to often insert \\"‚Äîing\\" mid-sentence (the suffix of an action verb without the verb itself). This hints that Mr Tulip's parental figures have left a lasting impression on his psyche, as he is someone who wants to swear but has been taught not to. It is also likely a commentary on the use and censorship of the swear word \\"fucking\\" in dialogue. His primary skill in the New Firm is the application of his apparently unlimited supply of unspecific anger; Tulip has turned mindless violence into an art form. Mr Tulip has a tendency to buy and consume anything sold in little bags in an attempt to acquire drugs, but which tend to be rather common albeit unpotable items (such as chalk, pickles and corned-beef sandwiches). The few times he's actually acquired real narcotics, they have been suitable only for trolls. Mr Tulip's past is hinted at being dark and fearful, a place even Mr Tulip is afraid to remember. The place where he lived had been apparently in the middle of a war zone. At the last, even their own soldiers were killing farmers, desperate to find any food. His people also have a superstition that those who die while holding a potato will be reincarnated. His belief in this is quite firm, as \\"since they've believed it for centuries, it must be right\\". He is killed by Mr Pin near the end of the novel and used for a life raft as molten lead flows around the pair. Unfortunately, Mr Pin also steals his potato shortly before killing him, but Mr Tulip manages to retain the memory of a potato in the afterlife. Death, perplexed at the concept of a soul having a strong but completely vague belief and noticing Tulip's showing some remorse, allows him to reincarnate as a woodworm. His final thought in the novel is that 'this is ‚Äîing good wood!' Lord Mortimer, Duke of Sto Helit \\"Mort\\", short for Mortimer, is the title character in Mort. He is first seen as the overly thoughtful son of a farmer in the Octarine Grass Country, near the Ramtops. Having proved himself unworthy as a scarecrow he is chosen by Death to be his apprentice. Mort is described as being very tall and skinny, with muscles like knots in string. He has a shock of bright red hair, and walks as if he is made entirely of knees. Mort starts off at the bottom, learning to accept his position while mucking out the stables, and trying to ignore Ysabell, Death's adopted daughter. When Death feels in need of a break, Mort takes over The Duty. Unfortunately for Mort, his feelings for a teenage princess of Sto Lat get in the way of his job and he starts off a chain reaction of events by impulsively preventing her assassination. Reluctant to tell his master about his gaffe, Mort tries various unsuccessful methods to fix the situation. After fighting and losing to Death, Mort was given an extra lease of life when the Grim Reaper chose to turn over his Lifetimer. This allowed Mort to stay in the world of the living. After the events of Mort, Mort leaves Death's service and marries Ysabell. The couple are given the title of Duke and Duchess of Sto Helit, and later also become the parents of Susan Sto Helit. They subsequently meet their end after a freak accident sends their carriage plunging into a ravine, as revealed in Soul Music. They had discussed this with Death and had turned down his offer to extend the duration of their existence on the grounds that it would not be the same as actually lengthening their lives. In The Light Fantastic, Rincewind overhears Twoflower teaching the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (Death, Famine, Pestilence and War), how to play bridge. At one point, War refers to Death as \\"Mort\\" but we later learn that the only people in the room (other than Twoflower), were Death, Famine, Pestilence and War (\\"mort\\" is \\"death\\" in Quirmian/French). The name might be a possible reason as to why Death chose Mort as his apprentice. In the Cosgrove Hall animation of Soul Music, Mort is voiced by Neil Morrissey. In 2004 BBC Radio 4 adapted Mort, with the title character voiced by Carl Prekopp and Ysabell being voiced by Clare Corbett. Mort is included in Wayne Barlowe's Barlowe's Guide to Fantasy. Nijel the Destroyer Nijel the Destroyer, son of Harebut the Provision Merchant, is a would-be barbarian hero, appearing in Sourcery. Nijel meets Rincewind in a snake pit and they escape together. He falls in love with Conina (a barbarian heroine who wants to be a hairdresser but cannot due to her genes) at first sight, and she with him. He is a clerk who wants to be a Barbarian Hero and is currently half-way through a book on the subject, which includes a table of wandering monsters and tends to resemble a Dungeons & Dragons manual. In addition to the standard loincloth, Nijel wears woolen long underwear--his mother insisted. Olaf Quimby II A past Patrician of Ankh- Morpork referred to in The Light Fantastic, Olaf Quimby was noted for his interest in honest and accurate descriptions as well as proper standards for everything, particularly metaphor. As Patrician, he used his power to enforce laws against creative exaggeration in writing. For example, no bard was allowed to say of a hero that \\"all men spoke of his prowess\\" on pain of death; he should instead add that some people spoke ill of the hero and that still others did not know of him at all. Similarly, the phrase \\"her face launched a thousand ships\\" could only be used to describe a beautiful woman if relevant shipyard records were produced or, failing that, evidence that the woman's face resembled a champagne bottle. As far as standardization was concerned, Quimby instituted the Ankh-Morpork Bureau of Measurements, in which is kept the standardized Blunt Stick (originally a Sharp one was on display as well, but very few things were found worse than a poke in the eye with it), the recipe for the Pie that It May be As Nice As, Two Short Planks and the stone used in the original Moss-Gathering Trials. This Bureau is maintained by the current Patrician, Lord Havelock Vetinari, on the grounds that the sort of people whose minds work like this ought to be kept busy, or they might do anything. Quimby's reign ended when he was killed by a disgruntled poet during an experiment to test the truth of the saying \\"The pen is mightier than the sword\\". In his memory, it was amended to read: \\"The pen is mightier than the sword only if the sword is very small and the pen is very sharp\\". It has been noted that many Ankh-Morporkians tend to have a certain literal mindedness. It is not known if this is the result of Quimby's rule, or simply a natural trait that reached its peak in him. Polly Perks The main character in Monstrous Regiment. A Borogravian girl of 16 who joined the army under the name Oliver Perks to rescue her brother Paul and save her family's inn. She chose her false name, Oliver, because it corresponded with the folksong \\"Sweet Polly Oliver\\", which is about a girl running off to join the army. As a member of the Cheesemongers, Private 'Ozzer' Perks serves with the colourful Sgt Jackrum, a reformed vampire named Maladict, a troll called Carborundum, an Igor, and a few even stranger people, who are, in fact, all women in disguise. By the end of the book, Polly is a seasoned soldier, and it turns out, not the important one in the unit. At the end of the book, Polly has left the army, but rejoins as a sergeant when Borogravia is invaded again. Princess/Queen Kelirehenna (Keli) Daughter of King Olerve the Bastard of the Sto Plains kingdom of Sto Lat, and the last person between the Duke of Sto Helit and the throne, she was saved from assassination by Mort, who found himself unable to allow her would-be assassin to kill her. After the initial complications had been sorted out- the universe insisted that she should be dead for a time, which meant that most people simply refused to acknowledge her existence unless she made her presence clear- she became Queen Kelirehenna I, Lord of Sto Lat, Protector of the Eight Protectorates and Empress of the Long Thin Debated Piece Hubwards of Sto Kerrig. Queen Keli still ruled at the time of Soul Music, when she ejected the Band with Rocks In from the city by royal proclamation. Sto Lat still had a queen by the time of Going Postal, though she is not mentioned by name. If it is her, she would be the first person on the Disc other than the Patrician to have her face on a stamp. The last mention of Queen Keli comes from Raising Steam, when she is noted to be at the opening of the new Rail Line between Sto Lat and Ankh-Morpork Was voiced by Alice Hart in the BBC Radio Four adaptation of Mort. Pteppicymon XXVIII (Teppic) King Pteppicymon XXVIII of Djelibeybi (lit. \\"Child of the Djel\\", the Disc's version of Egypt) is the main character in Pyramids. The first king to leave the kingdom, he was trained at the Ankh-Morpork Assassins' Guild. He passed his final exam by a fluke, having already decided he was not going to kill anyone. His cosmopolitan nature clashed with the hidebound traditions of the kingdom and the even more hidebound high priest Dios, and after saving Djelibeybi from destruction and shaking up its traditions, he abdicated, leaving the throne to his half-sister Ptraci I. Ptraci I Queen Ptraci I of Djelibeybi. Pteppic's half-sister and successor. A former handmaiden, the Djelibeybian priests thought she would be easy to control. They turned out to be very wrong. Like her half-brother she is keen to get in some decent plumbing. Appears in Pyramids; by the end of the novel she is enthusiastically embracing many of the stranger regimens, such as bathing in ass's milk, favoured by Cleopatra. Reacher Gilt Reacher Gilt appears in the novel Going Postal. He is the head of a consortium of financiers who had been embezzling from the clacks network since it was set up, and who, when it reached the point of collapse, bought the original owners out with their own money. A ruthless businessman with a piratical appearance, including an eyepatch and a cockatoo that, instead of saying \\"pieces of eight\\", said \\"twelve and a half percent\\" (that is, one eighth), he was a shameless con- artist and fraudster whose business style was described as playing \\"find the lady with entire banks\\". Under his management, the clacks network became more profitable, but less reliable. As the new owners did not really understand the clacks the way the previous management had, they worked it until it broke. He maintained his monopoly by killing anyone attempting to set up another network, including Robert Dearheart's son, John, and employing the banshee Mr. Gryle to do so. After his dealings were uncovered, Havelock Vetinari offered him the \\"choice\\" of becoming head of the Royal Mint, or walking out a door, without a floor behind it. He chose the latter. In the TV adaption of Going Postal, Gilt is portrayed by David Suchet. Gilt is presented as a nominal parody/satire of Ayn Rand's libertarian John Galt, both in his initial introduction (\\"Who is Reacher Gilt?\\") and in his professed views (\\"Freedom, my lord, is Man's natural state!\\" [Lord Vetinari] \\"Indeed - as is sitting naked in a tree eating your dinner while it's still wriggling.\\") Rincewind Roland de Chumsfanleigh Pronounced \\"de Chuffley\\" (which, as Pratchett says, is not his fault). Son of the Baron of the Chalkland. First introduced in The Wee Free Men, the first novel in the Tiffany Aching series. Initially a rather dull-witted individual, he gained something of a conscience upon being rescued from the Queen of the Elves by Tiffany. When he is 12 years old, Roland he is kidnapped by the Queen, and does not age during his captivity since time hardly passes while in Fairyland. When a 9-year-old Tiffany finds him there in The Wee Free Men, a year has passed on the Disc since his disappearance, and so he would have been 13 in the \\"real\\" world. Roland personally apologised to Tiffany when his father made out that he had in fact rescued her, as would be expected in such a story. Tiffany was nonplussed, and claimed she needed no apology or recompense so long as he ruled justly when he became Baron. Roland's father eventually fell very ill, and his two scheming aunts used their new position as his guardians to rob his family blind. Roland fought back as far as he could, in the process learning a great deal about surviving sieges and the art of insurgency. When his aunts block up his bedroom door to stop him from leaving, he muses that he has only been left with a false panelled hidden door, a passage behind a tapestry and a trap door in his floor. He has also been hoarding food, and rescuing much of the castle's silverware and paintings. In Wintersmith, Roland was reluctantly recruited by the Nac Mac Feegle to perform the role of the mythic Hero in the Dance of the Seasons, to put right the damage Tiffany had caused by interfering in the dance and the proper roles of the Wintersmith and the Summer Lady. Against all expectations, he acquitted himself admirably. There are signs that his feelings for Tiffany extend somewhat beyond gratitude. He also gave Tiffany a box of watercolors, one of which was turquoise, allegedly very expensive on the Discworld. When Tiffany went to Lancre to study witchcraft in A Hat Full of Sky, Roland gave her a silver necklace in the image of the giant white horse that is carved into the Chalk; Tiffany uses the necklace as a symbol to draw on the power of her homeland in times of crisis. By the fourth book in the series, I Shall Wear Midnight, Roland and Tiffany have realised that simply being different from those around them does not mean they are similar, and Roland decides to marry Letitia Keepsake, a good-natured if somewhat pampered aristocrat. While Tiffany is at first bitter about this, she eventually comes to terms with the situation and ultimately marries the couple herself. Ronald Rust An Ankh-Morpork nobleman, whose full name is Ronald Rust. He first appears in Men At Arms, in which he is one of the nobles who does not take d'Eath seriously. In this novel he seems to have keen political instincts; it is stated that the Rusts have survived by not being romantic. Lord Rust makes more sizeable appearances in Jingo and Night Watch, wherein he appears overly bred and arrogant; a brief subsequent appearance in Monstrous Regiment suggests he still has some of the intelligence of his earlier portrayal. Lord Rust's most defining characteristic, along with his arrogance, is his unsurpassed military and strategic incompetence (or, at least, his ability to achieve goals only by simultaneously sustaining devastating losses; he is described as operating on the theory that a battle was a glorious victory if enemy casualties outnumber friendly casualties, coupled with the inexplicable ability to be repeatedly chosen to command large armies and similar organizations, hence his description as \\"The god's gift to the enemy, any enemy, and a walking advertisement for desertion.\\" He is ridiculously brave, often simply charging while the weapons just miss him, every time. Also notable is his method of dealing with unpleasant occurrences. He simply mentally edits them out. In \\"Snuff\\", he is portrayed as an elderly man in a wheelchair, with a sunken look. Rosemary Palm Head of the Guild of \\"Seamstresses\\" (actually prostitutes). Her establishment is used as a place to stay by Granny Weatherwax and Nanny Ogg in Maskerade (on the recommendation of 'Nev' Ogg, though Granny Weatherwax had stayed there previously with Eskarina Smith in Equal Rites) and by Carrot on first settling in Ankh-Morpork (in Guards! Guards!). Mrs Palm was considered almost a witch by Granny. Her character also appears in Night Watch. Her name is a play on the saying \\"a date with Rosie Palms,\\" a slang term for masturbation. Rosemary Palm is similar to real-life brothel owner, Lou Graham, who's employees were officially accredited as \\"Seamstresses\\". Rufus Drumknott Secretary to Patrician Vetinari of Ankh-Morpork, following the death of Lupine Wonse. First appears in Men at Arms. Commonly seen entering and leaving the presence of the Patrician bearing either paperwork or verbal information on the activities of other denizens of the city, or the Discworld in general, Drumknott seems not to think much about the political implications of the information he works with, believing in filing for its own sake. During The Truth he was seemingly attacked by the Patrician--later revealed to be a lookalike hired to try to get Vetinari deposed--and by the time of Going Postal, was responsible for relaying the orders of the Patrician in assigning tasks to other clerks. William de Worde described him as someone with \\"no discernible personality.\\" In Unseen Academicals, he reveals that he cannot understand the fuss that is being made about football, both old and new. In the TV adaptation of Going Postal, Drumknott is portrayed by Steve Pemberton. Sacharissa Cripslock The daughter of an engraver (who possibly appeared in Maskerade, working for Goatberger) she became a reporter for the Ankh-Morpork Times, having originally arrived at the print works to complain about the invention of moveable type. Somewhat eclectically attractive, she possesses at least two features that would have made various artists from various times in history bite their easels in two--although, it must be said, that having a nose that would appeal to Rembrandt and a neck that would inspire Pablo Picasso does not, in and of itself, guarantee that the whole succeeds as a work of art. It is also implied that she has an excellent figure (\\"other features that are considered attractive in any time\\"). She tries to hide her buxom qualities, without success. However, it does mean a lot of men are happy to tell her things. She possesses the ability to think in headlines, and has gained valuable experience as an editor, allowing her to, e.g., reduce an article's length in half merely by crossing out all the adjectives. Appears in The Truth, Going Postal and Making Money. In Going Postal she wears a wedding ring and is assumed to be married, presumably to William de Worde, although she still refers to herself as Miss Cripslock. She is very respectable, meaning there is a lot of unrespectability waiting to come out. As of Making Money, she seems to have become the Times' chief liaison to Moist von Lipwig, and she has developed a talent for asking devious questions that, if answered thoughtlessly, would make for interesting and embarrassing news headlines. Moist, for his part, regards the interviews with her as a guaranteed thrill requiring him to think quickly on his feet. In the TV adaptation of Going Postal, Miss Cripslock is portrayed by Tamsin Greig. Pratchett has stated on Twitter that she is married to William de Worde, retaining her maiden name for professional purposes.tweet by Terry Pratchett Seldom Bucket Seldom Bucket was a big man in cheese production in Ankh-Morpork, but who, just prior to the events in Maskerade, purchases the Ankh-Morpork Opera House. He is obsessed with making money from the Opera and is horrified to learn how expensive seemingly trivial items (such as ballet shoes and musical instruments) can be. When he starts to hear about the strange murders being committed by the \\"Opera Ghost\\", his first concern is how expensive the murder might prove to be, though he does acknowledge the seriousness of the event as well. His relationship with Mr Salzella is one of mutual distrust and Mr Bucket has no time for Salzella's dry wit and humour, especially when Salzella is making crude comments about people having been hanged. Sergeant-Major Jack Jackrum A character in Monstrous Regiment, Jackrum is an immensely fat, hard-bitten Borogravian sergeant major with decades of military experience. He is known, either personally or by reputation, by practically every soldier in the Borogravian Army, and boasts that he is probably quite well known by the soldiers of the enemy armies too. Jackrum has, over the years, been the sergeant in command of (or under) a number of young soldiers who then rose up to the Army's high command, and thus wields considerable influence. It is stated on several occasions that Jackrum should have actually retired long ago, with his official resignation papers constantly following him around by mail, but he always finds some excuse to get out of them; at one point in the book, he resigns his commission so that he can brutally assault an enemy soldier without dealing with military protocol and is subsequently re-enlisted afterwards. Jackrum trains Polly Perks and gradually earns the respect of all the recruits. When confronting the heads of the Borogravian army, Jackrum reveals (after asking the other two-thirds to depart the room) that almost a third of the commanders are women, whom he uncovered during his time in the army, something that became something of a hobby for the sergeant. Ironically, Jackrum turns out to be a woman as well, having joined the army in her youth along with her lover, who died in battle, leaving the young Jackrum pregnant, something that she covered up by taking her considerable accumulated leave. When the novel ends, Jackrum has reunited with her long-lost son on the advice of Polly, although she has apparently introduced herself as his father rather than his mother, on the grounds that a fat old woman showing up claiming to be his mother would just be an inconvenience, but a distinguished sergeant-major claiming to be his father would be something to be proud of. Stanley Howler One of the two remaining employees of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office prior to Moist von Lipwig being made Postmaster. Raised by peas (no further explanation is given), Stanley has a tendency towards obsessive behaviour, coupled with violent incidents (his 'little moments') when under stress. He used to be one of the more obsessive of Ankh-Morpork's large number of pin collectors (called 'pinheads'), to the point that all the other collectors thought he was \\"a bit weird about pins\\". Fortunately his liking for pins can be used to calm him down from his, as called in the books, 'Little Moments'. However, following the events of Going Postal, in which the destruction of his collection coincided with the invention of the postage stamp, he redirected his obsession to stamp collecting and philately. Stanley's surname was not revealed in the book, but is given in various peripheral material relating to Discworld stamps. Stanley Howler is another example of parallel Discworld- Terrestrial history: on Earth, Stanley Gibbons is a company which publishes catalogues of stamps for collectors; the howler is a type of monkey, and the gibbon, like Unseen University's Librarian, is an ape. In the TV adaptation of Going Postal, Stanley is played by Ian Bonar. Susan Sto Helit Tacticus General Callus Tacticus was a soldier of the Ankh-Morpork Empire, and is widely proclaimed to be the greatest general of all time. In fact, on the Discworld the word 'tactics' was derived from his name. He has been dead for nearly 2000 years by the start of the Discworld series. In Jingo his name is given as Gen. A. Tacticus. In Wintersmith, however, his first name is given as Callus. Tacticus conquered a large area of the Discworld, both around the city of Ankh-Morpork and well into the rimward continent of Klatch. Since his campaigns were as expensive as they were effective, the rulers of Ankh-Morpork tried to get rid of Tacticus in a respectful and appropriate way. When at one point the far-flung city of Genua, having run out of royalty of their own, asked Ankh-Morpork for a Duke, Tacticus was promoted and sent there. Immediately upon becoming a Genuan citizen, he evaluated the question of the greatest military threat posed by any single other nation. Tacticus therefore declared war on Ankh-Morpork, which (it is implied) was the reason why Ankh- Morpork lost its large empire. When Vimes got a copy of Tacticus' autobiography from the Librarian, he formulated a characteristically cynical opinion as to why Tacticus, although respected, was not much liked by history: Tacticus did not get a huge number of his men killed by his own arrogance and incompetence. Snippets of Tacticus' advice turns up in various Discworld chronicles, and it can be gathered that he was a very realistic, down-to-earth general. For example, the section of his autobiography entitled \\"What to Do When One Army Occupies a Well-Fortified Fortress on Superior Ground and the Other Does Not\\" begins with the sentence \\"Endeavour to be the one inside.\\"Terry Pratchett, Carpe Jugulum, Doubelday, London 1998 Another good example of Tacticus' sense of pragmatism would be his maxim \\"It is always useful to face an enemy who is prepared to die for his country. This means that both he and you have exactly the same aim in mind.\\"Terry Pratchett, Jingo, Corgi Books 1998 (paperback), p. 206. Tawneee Tawneee (pronounced with each \\"e\\" as a separate syllable) is an exotic dancer, introduced in Thud! Tawneee is, in fact, merely her stage name; her real name is Betty. She is Nobby Nobbs's girlfriend for most of the book; they met when Nobby caught her eye while slipping an IOU into her garter belt. The fact that she is Nobby's girlfriend is somewhat shocking considering his barely human appearance and her incredibly stunning good looks. However, her looks make her unapproachable, as all men have considered her out of their league; Nobby only asked because he was so used to rejection he would have simply regarded it as just another day. Despite her profession, she is as humble as a caterpillar, and has about as much brains. She was completely innocent about sex, and was completely unaware that her job could be considered \\"acting like a floozy\\"; in the end, Angua and Sally explain the facts of, well, everything. Meanwhile, Nobby considers letting her down gently because she did not know her way around a kitchen. Theda Withel A Holy Wood actress in Moving Pictures. Using the name Delores De Syn, she starred in several movies with Victor Tugelbend, usually as the maiden to be rescued. She is descended from the High Priestess of Holy Wood, and while sleeping, she was repeatedly possessed by an unknown force, possibly the priestess. This force used Ginger to attempt to awaken the Holy Wood guardian, which would have put a stop to the Holy Wood magic and prevented the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions from breaking through to the Discworld. Her name is a reference to Theda Bara. Tolliver Groat One of the two remaining employees of the Ankh-Morpork Post Office prior to Moist von Lipwig being made Postmaster. A very old man in a cheap wig, Groat had spent most of his career in the Post Office as a Junior Postman, since until von Lipwig's arrival none of the other Postmasters appointed by Lord Vetinari had survived long enough to promote him. Groat does not trust doctors, which is perfectly understandable since there are very few reliable doctors in Ankh-Morpork. He instead treats himself with a variety of apparently dubious \\"natural\\" home remedies (later revealed to be, in actuality, extraordinarily effective), including concoctions made with sulfur or arsenic, and a poultice made of bread pudding. He is a habitual speaker of Dimwell Arrhythmic Rhyming Slang, the only known rhyming slang in the universe that does not actually rhyme. In Going Postal, Groat tells Moist von Liping about his hair that, \\"It's all mine, you know, not a prunes\\". Explanation reveals that in Dimwell slang, \\"syrup of prunes\\" means wig. (In Cockney rhyming slang, the expected derivation would be \\"syrup of figs.\\") Another example given in the text is \\"cup-and-plate\\"--no definition is given, but \\"He's a bit cup-and-plate in the head\\" implies it means \\"not quite right.\\" Tolliver also had a very small part in Wintersmith. The wintersmith approaches him to take some sulfur, so that he would become a man. This incident was reported in The Ankh Morpork Times, and a widow approached him, swayed by 'a man who knows his hygiene.' It is now believed that they are enjoying a relationship, as she was seen walking with him. His trousers and socks are confirmed as being highly explosive, as a result of the gunpowder-like solution they are treated with. His wig is believed to be sentient, and is certainly self-mobile, having escaped from a locked cupboard in the hospital. In Making Money, Groat was left in charge as acting-Postmaster General while Moist von Lipwig assumed his de facto position as chairman of the Royal Bank of Ankh Morpork. In the TV adaptation of Going Postal, Groat is portrayed by Andrew Sachs. Traveling professionals In addition to more traditional traveling folk, such as tinkers, actors, peddlers and so on, the Disc has a number of itinerant groups who provide professional services for communities that only need such services infrequently. Established groups include teachers (Wee Free Men), librarians (Wintersmith) and accountants (Making Money). Trevor Likely A worker at the Unseen University's candle vats, though he seldom does any work, leaving most of it to the affable goblin (actually orc) Mr. Nutt. Instead, he prefers to kick a tin can around, something at which he has gained an almost magical proficiency. Although seemingly destined for the game of football, he refuses to play, on account of his Mum, who saw his father, the only player to score four goals in a career, die during a game. But his mind begins to slowly change after an encounter with the lovely Juliet Stollop, and after the tactical substitution of the ball with a tin can, scores the winning goal in the inaugural game of the new football league. Appears in the book Unseen Academicals. Twoflower Verence II of Lancre King Verence II of Lancre first appears in the sixth novel of the series, Wyrd Sisters, as the court jester of the monarch of Lancre, Duke Felmet. He was previously the Fool to King Verence I, as his father and grandfather were before him. Over the course of the book, the Fool meets and falls in love with Magrat Garlick and stands up to the Duke, admitting he saw the murder of Verence I. At the end of the book Verence I's hidden heir, Tomjon, rejects the throne. Nanny Ogg then tells everyone that the Fool is Tomjon's older half- brother. It is assumed that this means he is the son of the elder Fool's wife and Verence I, and he is duly crowned Verence II. However, given how well the Queen got on with the elder Fool, there is another interpretation. In Lords and Ladies Verence and Magrat finally marry. Verence had gone through much of the story subtly trying to deal with a major problem, namely that he was not quite sure how to actually consummate the marriage. He ordered a book on the subject (\\"The one with the woodcuts,\\") from Ankh-Morpork, only to discover (in what would have otherwise been a horribly embarrassing scene) that he'd been mistakenly sent a book on MARTIAL Arts instead (he quickly recovers from the shock and presents the book to Shawn Ogg, the castle's only guard, as if that had been his intention all along). Near the end, he consults with Casanunda, a 'ladies man' dwarf that had assisted in the defense of the kingdom. In Carpe Jugulum they have a daughter; Princess Esmerelda Margaret Note Spelling of Lancre. Verence II is a very well-meaning king, who takes running a kingdom very seriously (he takes most things seriously, having learnt at a very early age that being a Fool was no laughing matter), but things seldom turn out the way he might want. The most noticeable results of his attempts at modernising the kingdom have been a Parliament that no-one attends and an invasion of vampires due to a diplomatic gaffe. It has been suggested that while his subjects appreciate his attempts to make life better, they would really prefer a king who orders them around and carouses a lot because they would know their place under such rule. Verence was voiced by Andrew Branch in the BBC Radio 4 adaptation of Wyrd Sisters, and by Les Dennis in the Cosgrove Hall animation. Victor Tugelbend Student wizard turned actor, and protagonist of Moving Pictures. Victor's uncle left a legacy to pay for Victor's tuition at Unseen University, provided that Victor never scored below an 80 on an exam. Victor, however, decided that being a student wizard was greatly preferable to being a wizard, because as a student he could live a relatively safe and comfortable lifestyle while as a wizard he would face the risk of assassinations by students wishing to advance. Therefore, Victor studied extremely hard and, when finals came around each year, carefully and competently scored an 84; four points above the minimum to continue receiving the legacy, but four points below the passing grade of 88 (On one occasion he actually passed by accident, but appealed against it on the grounds that he felt he'd failed to pay adequate attention to some details and he would not feel right to pass over the more eligible candidates; he subsequently only received an 82 and an 83 in the later exams as he was trying to be careful). Eventually this caught the attention of the Bursar, who arranged for Victor to receive a special test consisting of only one question: \\"What is your name?\\" By this time, however, Victor had left Unseen University to become an actor in Holy Wood, under the stage name Victor Maraschino, and the test paper in question was, instead, received by accident by Ponder Stibbons. He films several movies with Ginger Withel (aka Delores De Syn), and eventually uses the magic of Holy Wood to defeat the Things from the Dungeon Dimensions with Ginger's help. Victor has not reappeared in any subsequent Discworld books. Victor is also notable for being actively lazy; he kept himself fit because it was less effort to do things with decent muscles, and put a lot of work into avoiding work (as his University career illustrates). He was looking for a job that was romantic, but did not involve hard work, which Holy Wood provided. In \\"Moving Pictures\\", a summary given about him is a reference to Fred Astaire. Vorbis Wallace Sonky An Ankh-Morpork tradesman, owner of Sonky's Rubber Goods, and maker of Sonky's Preventatives. His \\"sonkies\\" (condoms), as they are generally known, sell for a penny a packet. Samuel Vimes considered him a saint as, without Sonky, the housing problems in Ankh-Morpork, as well as its population of idiots and criminals would be even more pressing. He was killed in The Fifth Elephant, after having helped produce the replica of the Scone of Stone. He is known to have had a brother in √úberwald. He is present briefly in Night Watch. Walter Plinge The odd-job man at the Ankh-Morpork Opera House. Plinge was an awkward, nervy figure in a beret, but he had a secret identity as the suave and sophisticated \\"Opera Ghost\\". Convinced by Agnes Nitt that he was wearing his mask on the inside, he became the director of music, following the death of Salzella. He writes popular operas \\"with tunes you can hum\\", a Discworld parallel to modern musicals. Walter's physical appearance is based on the character Frank Spencer, from the 1970s British TV series Some Mothers Do 'Ave 'Em. Spencer was played by actor Michael Crawford, who is also known as the original performer of the title character in the musical Phantom of the Opera.  William de Worde  A professional scribe who in The Truth has a career of writing down interesting news for various Lords and Ladies abroad, this led to him becoming the editor of the Disc's first newspaper, The Ankh-Morpork Times. He has an obsessive dislike of lying, which he has however learned to work around in the name of journalism. In self-imposed exile from his background of wealthy nobility, especially his father Lord de Worde, William works hard (and with varying degrees of success) to cast off the influence of his father, Lord de Worde, an arrogant speciesist,\\"Speciesism\\" is the Discworld version of racism, prejudice against dwarfs and trolls. It is implied at one point in The Truth that Lord de Worde also has \\"ordinary\\" racism, being prejudiced against people from Klatch. and bully, who goes so far as to leave the city and live in the countryside to avoid contact with these \\"lesser races\\". It has been suggested that by Going Postal he may have married his friend and editor, Sacharissa Cripslock. William also appears in Monstrous Regiment, as a war correspondent in Borogravia along with Otto von Chriek, and is mentioned in Thud!, Making Money, Unseen Academicals, and Snuff. According to Moist von Lipwig he is roughly the same age as Moist, who is 26 in Going Postal. Willie Hobson An Ankh-Morpork businessman who runs Hobson's Livery Stable, a multi-storey construction which sells and hires horses, as well as stabling other people's horses. For some reason it is a popular location for circumspect meetings. According to rumour, Hobson employs an Igor with a talent for taking body parts of different horses, and stitching them together into a \\"new\\" animal (see chop shop). Moist von Lipwig refers to a rumour that there is a horse in Ankh-Morpork with a longitudinal seam from head to tail. These rumours are rarely uttered in the presence of Hobson, who is a large man with a direct sense of humour when it comes to putting people with smart mouths on unbroken horses. He appears in Going Postal, although the stable had previously appeared in The Truth. His name is a reference to the real stable- owner Thomas Hobson, best known as the name behind the expression Hobson's choice. Hobson is a large man, described as looking similar to the result of shaving a bear. Willikins Lady Ysabell, Duchess of Sto Helit Ysabell is the adopted daughter of Death, who saved her as a baby when her parents were killed in the Great Nef desert (no explanation has been given as to why he did this; Ysabell said that \\"He didn't feel sorry for me, he never feels anything... He probably thought sorry for me.\\"). When first encountered she is a sixteen-year-old girl with silver hair and silver eyes who, it transpires, has been sixteen for thirty-five Discworld 'years' (no time passes in Death's Domain). During her encounter with Rincewind (see below), her behaviour is sufficiently flamboyant as to cause him to believe she is \\"bonkers\\". When Mort first encountered Ysabell, he was given the impression of \\"too many chocolates\\". She also has a fixation for the colour pink. Ysabell first appeared in The Light Fantastic, where she met Rincewind, and was surprised to learn that he was not actually dead. This state of affairs might not have continued long if the Luggage had not intervened. During the events of Mort it became clear that Ysabell was competent in carrying out the work of her father including The Duty and 'doing the nodes'. This mainly involves figuring out which deaths needed to be attended to personally, an important aspect of all reality. Before Mort arrived she shared her home with Albert, Death's manservant. In 2004 BBC Radio 4 adapted Mort, with the title character voiced by Carl Prekopp and Ysabell being voiced by Clare Corbett.

Riley was born at Stirling in South Australia to blacksmith Frederick Riley, an early Labor Party activist and local councillor, and Susannah, n√©e Williams. He left school at twelve and worked as a labourer. During a period in Sydney he was involved in socialist circles with Harry Holland. He was imprisoned for a week at Wollongong in 1914 after ignoring a policeman's demand to stop addressing a free speech public meeting. He became secretary of the Australian Peace Alliance's Victorian council in 1916, and was often fined over involvement in brawls at anti-conscription demonstrations; on one occasion he received a fine after protecting female speakers, including Vida Goldstein, from off-duty soldiers. A founding member and later secretary of the Y Club socialist discussion group, he participated in the 1919 Melbourne waterfront strike and helped negotiate a settlement. He married Alice Ann Warburton, n√©e Large, on 27 April 1920 in a civil ceremony. In 1922 he was appointed secretary of the Manufacturing Grocers' Employees' Federation of Australia and became a highly successful union leader. From 1931 to 1932 he was President of the Trades Hall Council, and he served as president of the Victorian branch of the Australian Labor Party from 1941 to 1942. In 1942 he became an adviser to the Commonwealth prices commissioner. His wife had died in 1940, and on 17 July 1943 he married Annie Elliott Warn. Riley was a member of the ALP's anti-communist right wing and was refused admission to the 1955 federal conference; despite his non-Catholicism he joined the Democratic Labor Party, of which he was Victorian president from 1960 to 1961, when he retired from public life.

Originally, the text appeared as essay in the 9th volume of the Journal of the Linnean Society, therefore the first edition in book form is actually called the ‚Äòsecond edition, revised.‚Äô Illustrations were drawn by Charles Darwin‚Äôs son, George Darwin. Following the Origin of Species Darwin set out to produce evidence for his theory of natural selection. Initially Darwin spent much time in studying plants to achieve this aim. This book stands second in line to his first work on plants, On the various contrivances by which British and foreign orchids are fertilised by insects. (1862) This work is subdivided into chapters concentrating on a particular type of climber which he divided into four main classes but Darwin, in this volume, concentrates on the two main classes, the twining plants and the leaf climbers (divided into two sub-divisions: leaf climbers and tendril bearers) The following comprise the chapters: 1\\\\. Twining plants 2\\\\. Leaf climbers 3 & 4.Tendril bearers 5\\\\. Hook and Root climbers. Context Inspired by reading an 1858 short paper by his friend Asa Gray on the movements of tendrils, Darwin set up experiments to explore the development of so many kinds of climbing plants in an evolutionary context. The concept of the power of movement in plants (‚Äòspontaneous revolutions of the stems...‚Äô p. 1) had already been observed as he acknowledges in the first chapter. His conclusions in his last plant book, The Power of Movement in Plants are key here: i.e. that circumnutation (the process that creates the circular or elliptical movement of the stem and tips of plants) was central in the development of multitudes of adaptations to the environment and thus resulting in an immense variety of plants. The climbing habit evolved from this basic power of movement. Darwin conducted, in his own words, \\"observations, founded on the examination of above a hundred widely distinct living species.\\" This, he maintained, \\"contain sufficient novelty to justify me publishing them.\\" Conclusions The spontaneous revolving habit of stems and tips has evolved in many plant groups in order to obtain light and/or support. Darwin in his conclusion explores the reasons for why these adaptations might have taken place, in what ways they may have been advantageous. For instance, an increased ability to hold on to support (by twining) will be beneficial in windy environments. In tall and dense forests, twining plants would probably succeed better with minor expenditure of organic matter. All this evolved due to an inherent ability to respond to their ‚Äòwants‚Äô by moving. (p. 202). Darwin states: \\"It has often been vaguely asserted that plants are distinguished from animals by not having the power of movement. It should rather be said that plants acquire and display this power only when it is of some advantage to them; this being of comparatively rare occurrence, as they are affixed to the ground, and food is brought to them by the air and rain.\\" (p. 206).

Biography  Benjamin John Fuller was born on 20 March 1875 in Shoreditch, London to compositor John Fuller and Harriett, n√©e Jones. From December 1884 to February 1885 young Ben appeared in a juvenile production of The Pirates of Penzance at the Savoy Theatre; two years later he was a member of Montague Robey's Midget Minstrels and later joined Warwick Gray's Juvenile Opera Company. Ben's father, John Fuller Snr. was a gifted singer with a magnificent tenor voice who gave up his day job as a compositor when he was invited to join the famous songwriter Harry Hunter's Mohawk Minstrels in October 1881. Harry Hunter wrote John Fuller Snr's signature song Geraldine. In 1889, John Fuller Snr. accepted an invitation to tour Australia with the London Pavilion Company and arrived in Melbourne aboard the Cuzco on 3 August 1889. However, John Fuller Snr. was left in Sydney, out of pocket and without a return ticket to London after the London Pavilion Company failed financially in January 1890. After the company disbanded John Fuller Snr. decided to stay in Australia as he could see great opportunities in the theatre business in both Australia and New Zealand. In July 1891 he was joined by his second wife Matilda Fuller, son John Fuller Jnr. and daughter Hettie Fuller in Melbourne, after their voyage aboard the Oratava. After touring New Zealand with the Albu Sisters in 1893, John Fuller Snr. opportunely took out a short lease on the Auckland City Hall in September 1893 and started The People's Popular Concerts along with his son John Fuller Jnr., they then took their Company and toured New Zealand main townships, including Dunedin and Wellington. A year later they took out a lease on the St James Hall in Auckland. After touring England Ben eventually joined his father in Adelaide arriving aboard the Austral in February 1895, where John Fuller Snr. had been touring with The Continentals during a seasonal break from his Popular People's Concerts in New Zealand. Another son Walter and daughter Lydia also joined the family in Auckland in April 1895, where the Fullers continued to produce and sing in their People's Popular Concerts at the Auckland City Hall in New Zealand and later leasing theatres Dunedin and Wellington. For further information see www.relativesmatter.com Walter Fuller was musically gifted as a vocalist and conductor as well as playing by ear several musical instruments including the organ and mandolin. Ben Fuller had also learned to play the piano and the double bass by ear. Later John Fuller Snr. set up waxworks and lantern/myriorama shows with Walter as interlocutor, John Jnr. as electrinopticon and Ben as comedian. Later Ben managed the Alhambra Theatre in Dunedin whilst Walter Fuller managed their theatres in Christchurch and John Fuller Jnr. managed Fuller's Theatres in Wellington where John Jnr. also became a prominent Wellington City Councillor. John Fuller Snr. remained in Auckland managing the Fuller's Theatres until he stepped back from the business allowing his sons to take the helm by 1910. On 6 October 1900 Ben Fuller married Jessie Elizabeth Burton, n√©e McDonald, a widow; she bore him a son in 1902 but died in May 1903. He married again, to Elizabeth Mary Lily Thomson on 8 November 1905. The Fullers continued to tour around New Zealand and extended their circuit to Australia, where they purchased James Brennan's vaudeville circuit (1912) and established the John Fuller & Sons Ltd (1914) operating the Ben. J. Fuller's big australasian vaudeville circuits (1915). Their first foray into operatic management was the tour of the popular Gonsalez Italian Grand Opera Company performing in Melbourne, Sydney and Wellington in the 1916/1917 seasons. A patriotic comedy musical, The Bunyip was a success. The five Gonsalez brothers opened a new tour in Sydney on 10 March 1928, billed as the Fuller-Gonsalez Grand Opera Company.Currency companion to music and dance in Australia, Currency House Inc., 2003, p. 474fff and 445ff en ligne Ben based himself in Sydney, where he acquired the house Ardenbraught in the suburb of Point Piper. In 1920 he donated ¬£1000 to Vernon Treatt so that he could take up his Rhodes scholarship and he subsequently established the Fuller Trust for overseas training in agriculture. Knighted by George VI in the King's 1921 Birthday Honours, he contested Sydney in the 1922 state elections as an independent without success, and was a Nationalist candidate in the federal election of that year. In 1923 the Fullers partnered with Hugh J. Ward and focused on musical comedy. The family built the St James Theatre in Sydney, and survived the Depression by installing cinema apparatuses in their theatres. After the brothers divided their assets, Ben Fuller was governing director of Fullers' Theatres Ltd and attempted to establish an English language opera company without success. In partnership with Garnet Carroll from 1939, he jointly established the Carroll- Fuller Theatre Company Pty Ltd in 1946. He was chairman of the Howard Prison Reform League, vice-president of the Sydney Industrial Blind Institution, and president of the Australian Council for International Social Service. From 1945 to 1947, he allowed his home Ardenbraught in Point Piper to be used by 280 officers and men from the Royal Netherlands Naval Air Force, who were operating from the flying boat base in Rose Bay. This fact is marked by a plaque outside the house. He died at St George's Hospital in London in 1952. References External links * Benjamin John Fuller (a.k.a.

He coached the team to multiple international championships, winning 18 international medals, including several in the Olympics. Le Goff is known for having a large impact on the American eventing world, and the era in which he coached has been called the golden era for American equestrianism. Prior to becoming an American coach, Le Goff served in the French Army and competed in three-day eventing for France. He rode in the 1960 Summer Olympics, winning a team bronze medal, and the 1964 Summer Olympics, where he did not win a medal. He subsequently served as the coach for the French 3-day eventing team, winning multiple regional and international medals. After retiring as the American coach, he acted as a consultant to the United States Equestrian Team (USET) for new rider development, director of the USET Training Center and coached the Canadian national team. He was also an FEI judge, committee member and Olympic appeals judge. Personal life and competitive career Born in 1931, Le Goff's father was a French cavalry officer. Jack began riding early, and during his teenage years competed as a steeplechase jockey, as well as showing in dressage, showjumping, and eventing. At the age of seventeen, after the death of his father, Le Goff joined the French military and began riding for Cadre Noir, the national riding academy. After his training, he became a riding master at the school and he remained in this position for a decade.Bryant, pp. 115‚Äì116 As a French soldier he fought in the Algerian War after his appearance in the 1960 Olympic Games. Le Goff competed in two Olympic Games, in 1960 and 1964. In 1960, at the Roma Games, he finished sixth individually and helped the French team to a bronze medal. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, he finished twenty-third individually, while the French team came in eighth. He was also the French national eventing champion in 1956 and 1964. He is survived by his three children Martine, Dominique and Cyrille with Pauline Kralicek, two children Florence and Corinne with Marie-Madeleine Giraud, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren along with his long- time companion Susan Smith. Coaching career Following his return from Algeria and his competition in the 1964 Olympics, Le Goff became the coach of the French eventing team, remaining as such through the 1968 Summer Olympics. In this position he was the first civilian equestrian coach to take leadership, which had previously been under the control of the Army. During his tenure, French riders took gold medals at the 1968 Summer Olympics and the 1967 and 1968 European Junior Championships. After the Olympics in Mexico, he was recruited to the United States and became the eventing coach for the United States Equestrian Team. He coached the team through eight international championships, including the 1970 through the 1984 Olympics. His teams earned 18 international medals in all, most notably team gold and individual silver medals in Los Angeles in 1984. During his time as coach, Le Goff had complete control over the US eventing team including selection, training and pairing of horses and riders. He said that he was able to \\"identify the Team's event horses, blindfolded, merely by running his hands down their legs.\\"Bryant, pp. 41‚Äì42 Although this power has since been taken away from the US eventing coach and a more objective selection system put in its place, Le Goff's abilities in this area took the US teams to numerous medals while he was coach. In his position as American coach, USET historian Jennifer Bryant called him \\"one of the greatest coaches in three-day-eventing history\\",Bryant, p. 114 as he built a multiple-medal-winning team from previously unknown horses and riders. After retiring as the American coach, he spent five years in Hamilton, Massachusetts as the Director of the United States Equestrian Team (USET) Training Center. He also continued to work part-time in developing new riders for the American team, as well as taking a part-time job coaching the Canadian team for the 1992 Summer Olympics. He also served as a member of the Three-Day Event Committee for the Federation Equestre Internationale (FEI), including serving as a three-day eventing judge with the rank of \\"O\\", meaning Official International.Bryant, p. 120 He was an eventing judge at the 1994 World Equestrian Games, the 1996 Summer Olympics, and multiple European Championships. At the 2000 Summer Olympics, he served as the chair of the FEI Three-Day Event Committee and as the eventing representative to the Appeal Committee, assisting with supervising equestrian competition at the Games.Bryant, p. 237 After his retirement from coaching and judging, he moved between homes in Pennsylvania, Arizona, and France, until he died in France in 2009. Legacy In 1983, Le Goff was named Horseman of the Year by the American Horse Shows Association (the predecessor to the United States Equestrian Federation). In 1999, he was inducted into the United States Eventing Association's Hall of Fame, followed by being named as one of the 50 most influential horsemen of the twentieth century by the equine magazine Chronicle of the Horse in 2002. In 2009, after his death, the USET announced the creation of the Jack Le Goff Memorial Fund, to provide travel grants to United States riders competing at the FEI Eventing World Cup Final. Veteran US Olympic riders such as Michael Page and Mike Huber cite Le Goff as having a large impact on American eventing. Another US Olympic rider, Michael Plumb, says of Le Goff: \\"He was a disciplinarian, he was very strict, and he coached the team. I think we miss his approach. He could ride any of the horses brought to the Team, whether it was dressage or steeplechase or cross- country.\\"Bryant, p. 127 The 1960s, 1970s, and early 1980s are known as the US's \\"golden age of equestrian sports\\",Bryant, p. 155 with Le Goff being named as a major player in the eventing arena. Denny Emerson, another top US eventing rider, called Le Goff a \\"tactician, consensus builder, consummate horseman, outrageous flirt, teller of terrible jokes, promoter, master chef, father, fisherman, and probably that most defining persona of all, the quintessential French male bon vivant.\\" Notes References * Category:1931 births Category:2009 deaths Category:French male equestrians Category:Olympic equestrians of France Category:Olympic bronze medalists for France Category:Equestrians at the 1960 Summer Olympics Category:Equestrians at the 1964 Summer Olympics Category:Olympic medalists in equestrian Category:Medalists at the 1960 Summer Olympics ","title":"Jack Le Goff"},{"id":"33721216","text":"George McDonald is a New Zealand former rugby league footballer who represented New Zealand in the 1954 World Cup.

He is arguably the greatest ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. He was the son of Satyros I (432 - 389 BC), and was the grandson of Spartokos I, the first Spartocid ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom. Leukon ruled his kingdom jointly with his brother Gorgippos, who situated himself on the Asiatic side and ruled from Gorgippia, which he may have named after himself. Leukon was succeeded by his sons Spartokos II (349 - 342 BC) and Paerisades I (349-309). He was noted in antiquity as a strategist and a disciplinarian. In the writings of Aeneas Tacticus, How to Survive under Siege (Greek: Œ†ŒµœÅ·Ω∂ œÑŒø·ø¶ œÄ·ø∂œÇ œáœÅ·Ω¥ œÄŒøŒªŒπŒøœÅŒ∫ŒøœÖŒºŒ≠ŒΩŒøœÖœÇ ·ºÄŒΩœÑŒ≠œáŒµŒπŒΩ), he dismissed his guards who owed gambling debts, because their loyalty could be doubted during a city siege. He continued the war of his father against Theodosia and Chersonesus with the goal of annexing all the Greek colonies in the Bosporus. He also made Sindike his vassal upon defeating Oktamasades, and in an inscription (see Epigraphy) from Nymphaion he is described as \\"archon of the Bosporus, Theodosia, all Sindike\\". Leukon had a pivotal role in the Bosporan wars of expansion, a series of conflicts and sieges started by his grandfather, Spartokos and then continued by his father, Satyros. Throughout Leukon's reign, he conquered many cities and tribes, making his reign one which expanded the Bosporan Kingdom, and created a foreign and trade policy outside the Black Sea, significantly with Athens, a commercial friend of the Spartocids. Early Life and Reign Leukon was born to Satyros I, a ruler of the Bosporan Kingdom who had become king after the death of his father, Spartokos I, a man of Thracian descent with possible ties to the Odrysian royal dynasty, who usurped the former Greek Archaeanactid dynasty. Leukon may have been taught by Isocrates.To his Greek subjects, Leukon was merely an \\"Archon\\", but to the tribes in his dominions, he was \\"king\\". Nonetheless, the Athenians viewed him as a tyrant but nonetheless a friend of Athens. He was present during his father's unsuccessful war against the barbarian queen Tirgatao of the Ixomatae, where his brother Metrodoros died as a hostage. He became king with his brother Gorgippos after their father died during the unsuccessful first siege of Theodosia. Upon becoming king, he attacked the city of Theodosia at first without success, but continued to attack it until the city was defeated, both times being aided by Heraclea Pontica, probably to finish what his father began prior to his own death. At some point during his reign, he married a woman named Theodosia, who may have been the daughter of a powerful Bosporan diplomat named Sopaios. She bore him 3 sons named Spartokos II, Apollonios, and Paerisades I. Leukon also initiated a semi-fraudulent coinage reform in which he recalled all coins from the region to be minted into new coins with double the face value. Leukon also faced early problems with his subjects; he had to enlist the aid of merchants to successfully put down a rebellion fomented by some members of his court and even trusted friends. Military Campaigns Leukon had inherited several wars from his father, including one against the Ixomatae, led by queen Tirgatao, ending with the unsuccessful siege to Theodosia that claimed his father's life. Leukon was a leading figure of the wars of expansion, winning many battles and successfully laying siege to Theodosia. He and his brother Gorgippos made peace with the Ixomatae and focused their attentions to the west. =Siege of Theodosia (c.365 BC)= Theodosia and Chersonesus. After his father's death and his ascendance to the throne, Leukon laid siege the city of Theodosia twice. The first siege ended in a Bosporan defeat due to Tynnichus, a general sent by Heraclea Pontica, to relieve the city, which he accomplished, despite inferior numbers, due to trickery. =Siege of Theodosia (c.360 BC)= Leukon besieged Theodosia again 5 years later in a surprise attack, before the city could receive relief aid from the Heracleotes. It is possible that the Heracleotes withdrew before Leukon attacked due to a change of government from oligarchy to tyranny under Clearchus. He was then attacked by the Heracleotes in his own territory. Leukon, noticing that his own troops could be routed easily, positioned his Scythian soldiers in the rear and gave clear instructions that his men were to be struck down if they fled. This precaution helped his army defeat the Heracleotes. Shortly after his victory, Leukon made a peace treaty with the Heracleotes, ending the war. =Annexation of the Sindike Kingdom= Leukon then turned his eye to the Sindike Kingdom, where there had been a dynastic dispute between Hekataios, the king of Sindoi, and his son, Oktamasades who had taken power from his father. Before the Battle of Labrytai, Leukon said he ‚Äúmade a vow to erect a victory monument, but not to the local Apollo of Labrys, but to the supreme deity and patron of all the Bosporans, Apollo the Healer‚Äù. After defeating Oktamasades, it is possible Leukon persuaded Hekataios to give the kingship over to him, as Leukon was proclaimed \\"king of all the Sindike\\" shortly thereafter. Later Reign =Conflict with Memnon of Rhodes= During the probable last years of Leukon's reign, it is possible that Heraclea Pontica had hired Memnon of Rhodes, the famous guerrilla fighter who had fought Alexander. Heraclea Pontica sent envoys to Leukon to learn the size of his army. Upon hearing that there were not many soldiers, Memnon went to battle Leukon, and used trickery to gain an easy victory against the Bosporan army. Memnon had his army march over to a hill, leaving only half of his men visible, as if to show that there was desertion amongst his troops. He then dispatched a \\"deserter\\" to inform the Bosporan army that there had been a mutiny in the Heracleote army. The Bosporan forces marched out to Memnon's forces, believing that they had been split in half, but were defeated as in reality the army was completely intact. =Relations with Athens= Leukon was well regarded by the Athenians, as the Bosporan Kingdom exported a large portion of their grain primarily to Athens. On one occasion, when Athens could not make do on their payment because of restrictions Sparta had placed on them during the Peloponnesian War, he gave them 400,000 medinmoi of grain which is around 16,380 t, free of charge in 356 BC. For this, Leukon was praised in Athens and was both given citizenship and statues of him and his sons erected in Athens. His descendants such as Spartokos III, who gave Athens 15,000 medimnoi of grain (ca 590 t) as a gift. They would continue to follow this diplomatic friendship with the Athenians. Leukon also gave Athenian ships privileges at his ports and did not have them taxed when they docked. =Death and Legacy= Leukon died in 349 BC, after a reign of around 40 years, he was at least 60 years old during the time of his death, placing his birth prior to or around 410 BC. His body is thought to have been placed in the Royal Kurgan,Excerpt from Aarchaeological Walks in Ancient Kerch (Russian) a burial mound where the previous Bosporan rulers had been placed in, in the outskirts of Panticapaeum. Leukon's actions mirrored those of his grandfather, Spartokos I, who usurped the former Greek dynasty of the Bosporan state, as well as those of his father Satyros, whom he often credited with transforming Panticapaeum from a mere hegemony into an expansive kingdom on the Black Sea which would go on to be the longest-lasting Roman client-state for another 800 years. Leukon's descendants would rule the Bosporus for another two centuries‚Äîthe last of whom, Paerisades V, would die during a Scythian uprising.

Most species are medium-sized trees, sometime up to 40 metres in height, but a few species are shrubs. DNA molecular data shows that it is closely related to Rhodostemonodaphne and Ocotea. This genus has many species of high commercial value to the wood industry. Endlicheria species occur mostly in the drainage area of the Amazon from South America, and low coast rainforest and mountain tropical forest in the Greater Antilles, Guianas, Ecuador, Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Bolivia, Paraguay, to the south of Brazil, and in the Andean cloud forest in tropical America. The species of Endlicheria occur in moist forest habitats from elevations of around sea level to 2.500 meters in the Andean and Guianian highlands. At least two species are present in mountain cloud forest and Atlantic forest of south east Brazil, and two other species in Caribbean Lesser Antilles mountain cloud forest. Taxonomy Traditionally, Endlicheria was placed near Aniba and the other Lauraceae with two locellate anthers. However, it has been suggested that the two-locellate anthers that distinguish Endlicheria from Rhodostemonodaphne evolved repeatedly. The two genera form a group of approximately 100 known species.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. History The land where the John Ayres House is situated was acquired by John Ayres' parents, who had relocated from Philadelphia to Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, where they settled at the base of Peter's Mountain in October 1773. At that time, the Ayres' new property was bordered by Peter's Mountain (north) and lands owned by William Clark (east), Samuel Cochrane (south), and Jane Givens (west). William Ayres' property was subsequently bought by his son, John, who built a home there between 1800 and 1810. Note: This includes Architectural features The original section of the John Ayres House was built between 1800 and 1810, and expanded between 1815 and 1825. It is a large, 2 1/2-story, 5-bay, limestone dwelling in the Federal style. Also situated on the property are a contributing gazebo, carriage house (c. 1895), stable, early stone pig or sheep barn (c. 1895), spring house, and tennis courts (1939). Note: This includes On December 8, 1819, John Ayres was forced to sell a portion of his property at a Sheriff's sale. The terms of this sale stipulated that Ayers and his family would continue to be able to live in and use their home, which was described at that time as a stone dwelling. John Ayres later went on to become a successful attorney; when he died on August 17, 1825, he was reportedly the last of the Revolutionary War Patriots living in the area.

Cottle holds the unusual status of having been appointed to judgeships by both Democratic and Republican governors. He is also a former captain of the Stanford University football team. Education and football Born in Los Angeles, Cottle grew up in nearby Inglewood, where he attended Andrew Bennett Elementary School and Morningside High School. After Cottle was placed in foster care at the age of 14, his foster parents encouraged his athleticism, and he became a three-sport athlete at Morningside, playing on the school's baseball, basketball, and football teams. He was also student body president and served as the President of the California Association of Student Body Presidents. Cottle entered the University of California, Berkeley in 1958, but after attending for one day, he realized the school was a poor fit and transferred to Stanford University in time to start the fall quarter, as Fall Semester at Berkeley started one month before Fall Quarter at Stanford. After his transfer was approved but before classes began, he worked for the construction company building Stanford Hospital. Awarded a football scholarship, Cottle was a linebacker and center. A three-year letterman, he eventually became captain of the Stanford football team that defeated Cottle's former school (Cal) in the 1961 Big Game. He was a pre-medical student at Stanford, but during his senior year, he decided he did not want go into medicine and did not apply to medical school. After earning his Bachelor of Arts degree in history from Stanford in June 1962, Cottle worked for the University as a fundraiser and freshman football coach. The following year, he enrolled at the University of California, Hastings College of the Law. Working his way through law school, Cottle worked as a counselor for the probation department and a janitor at Hastings, where he earned his Juris Doctor in June 1966. Legal career Upon earning admission to the State Bar of California, Cottle worked as an attorney at the San Jos√© law firm of Berns & Steinberg until he was hired as a prosecutor by the Santa Cruz County District Attorney's office in 1968. He was assigned to prosecute sexual assault and rape cases for two years, after which he prosecuted 25 homicide cases. While he served in the District Attorney's office, Cottle taught evidence at Cabrillo College. In 1971, he assisted District Attorney Peter A. Chang, Jr. in prosecuting John Linley Frazier, who murdered a Soquel, California family because he believed \\"their house was destroying the environment.\\" In 1973, Cottle was the lead prosecutor in the case of serial killer Herbert Mullin, gaining convictions for all ten murders charged in Santa Cruz County (Mullin committed three more outside the jurisdiction). Cottle was elected District Attorney of Santa Cruz County in 1974 and took office in 1975. He served as the county's top prosecutor until his appointment to the bench. Judicial career Cottle resigned as District Attorney when he was appointed a Judge of the Santa Cruz County Superior Court in 1977 by Democratic Governor Jerry Brown. In 1979, Cottle ruled that the Boys Club of Santa Cruz County violated the Unruh Civil Rights Act when the club prevented girls from obtaining membership. (Eleven years later, the national Boys Clubs of America would change its name to the Boys & Girls Clubs of America.) In 1988, the California Sixth District Court of Appeal expanded from three justices to six justices, so Republican Governor George Deukmejian appointed Cottle one of the three new Associate Justices. The three new justices drew straws to determine seniority, and Cottle drew the middle straw and middle seniority. In 1993, Republican Governor Pete Wilson elevated Cottle to Presiding Justice of the Sixth District Court of Appeal. As Presiding Justice, Cottle fostered the Court's public outreach and education programs, including programs in Santa Cruz and Monterey and at the Santa Clara University School of Law. In 1995, Cottle wrote a unanimous decision upholding the right of the San Jose Mercury News to sell posters of football star Joe Montana without Montana's permission. In 1999, a case came before the Sixth District Court of Appeal regarding a San Jose law mandating the city's government find minority-owned and women-owned firms for city contracts, and Cottle ruled that the San Jose law was unconstitutional because it violated Proposition 209. Cottle retired from the court in 2001 and has become a private mediator and arbitrator.

After showing little worthwhile form as a two-year-old, Airborne improved to become one of the leading three-year-olds in Britain in 1946. He won five successive races including two Classics: the Derby at Epsom and the St Leger at Doncaster. He was the most recent of four greys to have won the Epsom Classic. Airborne went on to have a stud career of limited success. Background Airborne was a tall, rangy grey horse bred at Castletown Geoghegan, County Westmeath, in Ireland by Harold Boyd-Rochfort, the brother of the successful trainer Cecil Boyd-Rochfort. As a yearling he was sent to the sales where he was bought for 3,900 guineas by the British plastics manufacturer and racehorse-breeder John Ferguson. Ferguson sent the colt to be trained by the former jockey Richard ‚ÄúDick‚Äù Perryman at his Beaufort House stables at Newmarket, Suffolk. Airborne‚Äôs sire Precipitation was a top-class racehorse, best known for winning the Ascot Gold Cup in 1937. He went on to become a successful stallion, siring three other Classic winners in Why Hurry (Epsom Oaks), Premonition (St Leger) and Chamossaire (St Leger). Precipitation himself was sired by the unbeaten champion, Hurry On, making him a representative of the Godolphin Arabian sire line. Airborne‚Äôs dam, Bouquet, from whom he inherited his grey colour, never ran in a race, but produced nine winners, the best of them, apart from Airborne, being a sprinter named Fragrant View. Racing career =1945: two-year-old season= As a two- year-old, Airborne was extremely immature and failed to win in four starts, giving little indication of Classic potential, although he did finish fourth to the future 1000 Guineas winner Hypericum in the Dewhurst Stakes. =1946: three-year-old season= In Airborne‚Äôs three-year-old debut, he finished third in a moderate race at Newmarket in April. Two weeks later, he returned to Newmarket and won a maiden race over one and a half miles. The Derby of 1946 was the first to be run at Epsom since 1939, the course having been used as an anti-aircraft battery position during the war, and the race attracted a huge crowd, estimated at up to 500,000, including the King and Queen. Airborne, ridden by Tommy Lowrey, was an unconsidered outsider, starting at odds of 50/1 in a field of seventeen in a race run on soft ground. In the early stages, Airborne was held up and was still well back turning into the straight. Gulf Stream took the lead in the last quarter mile as Lowrey pulled Airborne wide to produce a sustained run down the centre of the course. He caught Gulf Stream inside the final furlong and won by a length. Airborne reappeared in the Princess of Wales's Stakes at Newmarket in July where he took on older horses. He won his third successive race by beating the five-year-old Hardwicke Stakes winner Priam II. The following month, he ran at Newmarket for the fourth time that season and dead-heated with Fast and Fair in the Stuntney Stakes. At Doncaster in September, he started 3/1 favourite for the St Leger, which was run before another huge crowd. He tracked the leaders before being sent to the front in the straight and winning \\"in magnificent style\\" by one and a half lengths from Murren, with Fast and Fair third. It was a second win in the race for Perryman and Lowrey, who had been successful with Chamoissaire the previous year. On his final start of the season, Airborne was matched against the Grand Prix de Paris winner Souverain in the King George VI Stakes over two miles at Newmarket in October. Airborne started 4/5 favourite for a race which was publicised as an \\"international championship\\" for three-year- olds but finished third to the French colt, with the Irish Derby winner Bright News taking second. Attempts to train Airborne as a four-year-old, with the Ascot Gold Cup as his target, ended in failure, and he was retired to stud without racing again. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Airborne an ‚Äúinferior‚Äù Derby winner. Stud career Airborne was not a success as a stallion. The best of his runners on the flat was the filly Silken Glider, who finished second in the Oaks and won the Irish Oaks in 1957. The best horse he sired was the Irish-trained jumper Flyingbolt. Airborne's progeny had won approximately ¬£25,000 in stakes up until the end of 1955. His last recorded foals were conceived in 1961. He died on 11 September 1962 of heart failure.

It took place on the Southern Front of the Russian Civil War and was part of the wider October counteroffensive of the Southern Front, a Red Army operation that aimed to stop Armed Forces of South Russia commander Anton Denikin's Moscow offensive. After the failure of the Red Southern Front's August counteroffensive to stop the Moscow offensive, the Volunteer Army continued to push back the front's 13th and 14th Armies, capturing Kursk. The Southern Front was reinforced by troops transferred from other sectors, allowing it to regain numerical superiority over the Volunteer Army, and launched a counterattack to halt the offensive on 11 October, utilizing a shock group composed of newly arrived troops. Despite this, the Volunteer Army managed to deal a defeat to the 13th Army, capturing Orel, its nearest advance to Moscow. The Red shock group, however, struck into the flank of the Volunteer Army's advance, forcing the army to commit its lead forces to defending against the attack. In fierce fighting, the 14th Army recaptured Orel, after which the Red forces wore down the Volunteer Army in defensive battles. The Volunteer Army attempted to establish a new defensive line, but their rear was unhinged by Red cavalry raids. The offensive ended on 18 November with the recapture of Kursk. Although the Red Army did not manage to destroy the Volunteer Army, the Southern Front counteroffensive marked a turning point in the war, as it had permanently regained the strategic initiative.  Background  After repulsing the Red Army Southern Front's August counteroffensive towards Kharkov, Lieutenant General Vladimir May- Mayevsky's Volunteer Army, part of Anton Denikin's Armed Forces of South Russia, resumed its advance on Moscow in mid-September 1919. The army's main attack was conducted by the 1st Army Corps towards Kursk, Orel, and Tula. On 20 September, the corps captured Kursk. The Southern Front's 13th and 14th Armies retreated north in the face of attacks by numerically superior White troops. As a result, the Central Committee ordered the Main Command of the Red Army to send reinforcements to the Southern Front and begin the transfer of the Latvian Rifle Division, Estonian and Separate Rifle Brigades, and the Separate Cavalry Brigade of Red Cossacks from the Western Front. These units were planned to be used to create a front shock group in the area of Navlya and Dmitrovsk. As a result of these measures, by 5 October, the Southern Front had regained numerical superiority in the Orel direction.  Prelude  Alexander Yegorov commanded the Red Southern Front during the operation By 10 October, the Volunteer Army shock group had reached the line of Khutor Mikhailovsky-Sevsk-Dmitrovsk-Yeropkino-Livny-Borki, and continued their advance north towards Moscow, seeking a breakthrough at Orel. The shock group included Lieutenant General Alexander Kutepov's 1st Army and Lieutenant General Yakov Yuzefovich's 5th Cavalry Corps. The group numbered approximately 19,000 infantry, over 5,000 cavalry, 72 guns, 373 machine guns, nine tanks, and fourteen armored trains. The 1st Army Corps included the Kornilov and Drozdovsky Infantry Divisions, and the Consolidated Infantry Division with the Markov and Alekseyev Brigades. They were opposed by the Red Southern Front, whose commander, Vladimir Yegoryev, was replaced by Alexander Yegorov on 11 October. The troops of the front in the Orel sector numbered over 52,000 infantry, more than 7,000 cavalry, 278 guns, and 1,119 machine guns, giving them a 3:1 numerical superiority over the Whites. = Soviet planning = In these conditions, the Soviet Main Command decided to begin the counterattack without waiting for the arrival of the Estonian Rifle Brigade. On 7 October, the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Republic, Sergey Kamenev, ordered the Southern Front command to draw up plans for the operation, and on 9 October subordinated to it the shock group, which concentrated in the Karachev area. In the Orel‚ÄìKursk operation, the troops of the right wing and center of the front were to advance in the general direction of Kursk, defeat the 1st Army Corps, and capture the line of Sevsk, Fatezh, and Livny. After completing the destruction of the corps, they were to retake Kursk and advance to the line of the Seym River and the Kursk-Kastornoye railroad. The missions of the armies were given to a depth of between 80 and 150 kilometers, and were divided into immediate and following. The main role was given to Antons Martuseviƒçs' shock group, consisting of the Latvian Rifle Division, and the Separate Rifle and Separate Cavalry Brigades, which numbered 10,000 bayonets and sabers. It was formed from newly arrived reinforcements. It was to launch its attack from the line of Turishchevo and Molodovoye, into the flank of the Volunteer Army's advance to Orel. With the beginning of the offensive, the group was operationally subordinated to Anatoly Gekker's 13th Army. The 13th Army's main forces (the 9th, 55th, and Consolidated Rifle Divisions) were to advance along the Orel-Kursk railroad and destroy the Volunteer Army's Kornilov Division in conjunction with the shock group, while its left flank units (the 3rd and 42nd Rifle Divisions and the 13th Cavalry Brigade) were tasked with attacking the Consolidated Division at Livny. The right flank units (the 46th Rifle Division and a brigade of the 41st Rifle Division) of Ieronim Uborevich's 14th Army, the front's right wing, were to capture Khutor Mikhailovsky, while the army's main forces (the 7th, 41st, and 57th Rifle Divisions, and the 11th and 14th Cavalry Brigades) were to defeat the Drozdovsky Division, then advance on Dmitriyev on the right of the shock group.  Offensive  On 11 October, the troops of the Red shock group and the 14th Army began the offensive. Overcoming the resistance of the Drozdovsky Division, Robert Eideman's 41st Rifle Division captured Khutor Mikhailovsky, while the shock group slowly advanced to Kromy. Meanwhile, the Volunteer Army shock group defeated the main forces of the 13th Army (9th, 55th, and Consolidated Rifle Divisions) and took Kromy on 10 October, before taking Orel on 13 October, their northernmost advance. At a distance of , this was the closest the White Russian forces got to Moscow in the Russian Civil War. This cut the communications between the 13th Army headquarters and the Red shock group, resulting in the transfer of the latter to the 14th Army, which had retreated from Sevsk and Dmitrovsk to the line of the Nerusa River. The Estonian Rifle Division, formed from the arriving Estonian Rifle Brigade and the remnants of the Consolidated Rifle Division, also joined the army. As a result of the White advance, the front ordered the shock group to use its main forces to advance on Yeropkino, with its left flank troops diverted to Orel, in the rear of the Kornilov division. The Estonian Rifle Division was to advance on Orel from the west and recapture the city in conjunction with the shock group's left flank units and the 9th Rifle Division, while the 14th Army's right flank units covered the right flank of the shock group in its attack to the east and southeast. The 13th Army's 9th Rifle Division (reinforced by the remnants of the 55th Division) and newly arrived 2nd Separate Rifle Brigade were to attack Orel from the north, while the 3rd and 42nd Divisions and the 13th Cavalry Brigade captured Livny. The shock group broke the White resistance on 14 October, and took Kromy on the night of 15 October, while the left flank threatened the rear of the Kornilov Division. This forced the commitment of the Drozdovsky and Kornilov Divisions to destroying the shock group, forcing the stoppage of the White advance on Tula. The shock group, deep into White lines, was attacked from both flanks and forced onto the defensive. Fierce battles, which often took on the character of meeting engagements, were conducted for the next several days with varying degrees of success for both sides. On 17 October, Yegorov committed the 14th Army reserve, Jakob Palvadre's Estonian Rifle Division. In three days of fierce fighting, the division, in conjunction with elements of the shock group, Pyotr Solodukhin's 9th Rifle Division, and the rest of the main forces of the 13th and 14th Armies, broke the stubborn White resistance and advanced on Orel from the southwest, west, and southeast. On the night of 20 October, the White troops hastily left the city, which was captured by the Estonian and 9th Rifle Divisions and the 3rd Latvian Rifle Brigade. On 21 October, strongly supported by artillery and armored trains, the Volunteer Army launched a counterattack on the front between Sevsk and Yelets. The army captured Kromy on 24 October and Sevsk on 29 October. Having exhausted the Whites in defensive battles, the Red Army recaptured Kromy and Dmitrovsk on 27 October, pushing them back from Orel and Yelets, before capturing Livny on 3 November. Having completely exhausted their offensive capability, the 1st Army Corps began to retreat to the south, and in order to prevent it from forming a defensive line at Sevsk, Dmitrovsk, Yeropkino, and Yelets, Yegorov ordered Uborevich to commit Vitaly Primakov's 8th Cavalry Division, formed during the operation from the 11th, 14th, and Red Cossack Cavalry Brigades and numbering 1,700 cavalry, six guns, and 32 machine guns on tachankas. Primakov's division entered the breakthrough to the southeast of Dmitrovsk on 3 November and advanced into the White rear. For three days, the cavalrymen fought 120 kilometers in the White rear, inflicting great damage on the retreating Whites. They took Ponyri on 4 November and Fatezh on 5 November. The 14th Army captured Sevsk on 6 November, and Dmitriev on 13 November. On 9 November, the 13th Army cut the Kursk-Kastornoye railway, splitting the Volunteer Army in two between its troops around Kursk and around Kastornoye. Janis Pauka's 42nd Rifle Division and the 13th Cavalry Brigade assisted Semyon Budyonny's Cavalry Corps in the rout of the White troops around Kastornoye on 15 November. Kursk was captured by the Estonian and 9th Rifle Divisions on 18 November. A key role in defeating the White troops around Kursk was played by a raid by Primakov's division between 14 and 18 November. The division captured the major road junction of Lgov on 15 November, and during the raid killed 500 and captured 1,700 White soldiers and officers, as well as capturing eleven guns, 50 machine guns, five armored trains, up to 200 supply wagons and other trophies. On 18 November troops of the 13th and 14th Armies reached the line of Rylsk, Lgov, Kursk, Tim, and Kastornoye, finishing the operation.  Aftermath  The Orel‚ÄìKursk operation halted Denikin's advance on Moscow and defeated the main White shock group, opening the way for the Red advance on Kharkov and the Donbass. Along with the simultaneous Voronezh‚ÄìKastornoye operation, it marked a turning point in the fight against the Armed Forces of South Russia, creating favorable conditions for the advance of the Southern and Southeastern Fronts in 1919 and 1920. The loss of Kursk and Kastornoye broke White morale, preventing them from resisting the Red advance in pitched battle, and precipitated a White retreat that lasted until they reached the North Caucasus. The strategic initiative on the front was gained by the Red Army, but it did not manage to destroy the Volunteer Army's main forces, due to weak communications between the armies, the inability to build up sufficient reserves during the offensive, and command shortcomings. The operation was characterized by being tensely fought for most of the operation, the high number of meeting engagements, large troop maneuvers, a decisive massing of troops in key sectors, the skillful use of cavalry for raids in the White rear, and low operational density ‚Äì on average, one division held between 25 and 70 kilometers, with between .8 and .2 guns per kilometer of front. The combat actions of the Southern Front were conducted to a depth of 350 kilometers.

History  Nishio Castle dates to the Kamakura period with a fortification called Saij≈ç-j≈ç was built by Ashikaga Yoshiuji in around 1221. The Saij≈ç was a cadet branch of the Ashikaga clan and late changed their name to \\"Kira\\", serving the Sunpu-based Imagawa clan. After the Battle of Okehazama in 1600, the castle was captured by Tokugawa Ieyasu. He assigned it to one of his generals, Sakai Shigetada, who rebuilt it with moats, stone walls, several yagura, gates and a donjon. After the transfer of the Tokugawa clan to the Kanto region by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, the castle was assigned to one of Hideyoshi's generals, Tanaka Yoshimasa, who was also castellan of Okazaki Castle. Tanaka Yoshimasa dismantled the existing donjon and built a much larger three-story tower at the edge of the second bailey, facing the front of the castle. The reason for this unusual orientation is unknown; possibly due to space limitations, and possibly to impress his authority over the j≈çkamachi. The castle also had a secondary three-story donjon and ten corner yagura, which made it very well-equipped considering its size and the kokudaka of the territory. Following the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the castle became the headquarters of Nishio Domain, which changed hands many times during the Edo period between several fudai daimy≈ç houses. The castle was dismantled in 1872, following the Meiji Restoration, and the inner bailey became a public park. Two of the original gates were left in situ. In 1996, a three-story yagura in central area and the main gate to secondary area was reconstructed along with a local history museum, and in 2014, the base of main donjon and stone walls of secondary area were also rebuilt  Literature   * External links *Japan Visitor *Japan Travel *Japan World Category:Castles in Aichi Prefecture Category:Museums in Aichi Prefecture Category:History of Aichi Prefecture Category:Nishio, Aichi Category:Owari Province Category:History museums in Japan Category:Ogy≈´-Matsudaira clan Category:Sakai clan ","title":"Nishio Castle"},{"id":"33722707","text":"Thomas Bedford may refer to: * Thomas Bedford (theologian) ( 1650), English controversialist * Thomas Bedford (historian) (died 1773), nonjuror and church historian * Thomas Bedford (MP), MP for Bedford * Thomas Bedford, physicist and namesake of Bedford Island * Thomas Bedford, American Revolutionary War officer, namesake of Bedford County, Tennessee * Tommy Bedford (born 1942), South African rugby player See also * *Bedford (surname) ","title":"Thomas Bedford"},{"id":"33722719","text":"Bedford is an English surname.

It is operated by South Staffs Water. One of the uses of the reservoir is to transfer water from the company's works at Hampton Loade, on the River Severn, to Burton upon Trent. Water is pumped uphill from the Sedgley Beacon Reservoirs, which receive water from Hampton Loade, through mains to Barr Beacon Reservoir via West Bromwich Booster. A main then carries water by gravity via Seedy Mill works to Burton on Trent. The water company also operates a weather station, one of several in its network, at the reservoir, to monitor temperature, hours of sunshine, and rainfall. The reservoir was re-roofed in 1969, temporarily exposing the brick arches which support the roof. In August 2013, Severn Trent Water launched a ¬£2 million project to build a 2 1/2 mile pipeline linking their Perry Barr Reservoir to Barr Beacon Reservoir, to allow for the exchange of water in emergencies such as severe droughts.  2011 flooding incident  More than two hours after the burst Shortly after 5am on 12 November 2011, (includes video) the 36-inch water main north of the reservoir burst, (includes video) emptying the reservoir of around of water, and flooding up to 150 homes in Aldridge Road, and Elm Tree Road in the Blackwood estate in the Streetly area of Sutton Coldfield. More than two hours after the burst Dozens of families had to be evacuated. Eleven fire trucks, from stations as far away as Erdington, and a high-volume pump from Sheldon, attended. A fire service boat was also deployed. The West Midlands Police, police helicopter, ambulance service and a specialist Automobile Association vehicle recovery unit also attended. Waters did not subside until 8am. The cause of the burst was not known, but South Staffs Water estimated that the floods caused more than a ¬£1 million of damage.

According to historical records, there were originally a hundred wells (some of which were \\"boiling wells\\"), however flooding of the nearby Xiangcao River covered many of them, leaving only six remaining. Water in the boiling wells is constantly bubbling, giving it the appearance of boiling, although the bubbling is actually caused by gas released from cracks beneath the wells.

Born in Cardiff, Bennett was notable for becoming the Welsh lightweight champion in 1993. He successfully defended his title on one occasion before retiring from the sport in 1996. History Bennett was a successful amateur boxer, fighting as a featherweight. In 1978, as an eighteen-year-old, he reached the final of the ABA Welsh amateur featherweight final. His opponent was Don George, who he beat on points to take the title. Bennett turned professional in 1981 as a featherweight, and his first pro fight was at York Hall in Bethnal Green, on the undercard of the British light welterweight contest between Clinton McKenzie and Des Morrison. Bennett faced London boxer Geoff Smart in a six-round bout, and stopped his opponent via technical knockout in the final round. Bennett went on to win his next four fights before challenging Don George for the vacant Welsh area featherweight belt. Held at Ebbw Vale Leisure Centre, the bout went the full ten rounds with George declared winner on points decision. The Welsh title fight began a string of defeats which saw Bennett leave the sport in 1983, before returning in 1986. When Bennett returned to the ring in 1986 he had moved up the weights to lightweight. His first fight at his new weight was against Dave Smith at the National Sporting Club in London. Bennett won the fight on points, and followed this up with a victory over Dave Pratt two months later. Bennett then boxed just three more times, before again taking another leave from the sport in 1987. He did not return to boxing until 1992, this time losing his opening fight, to Edward Lloyd at the National Ice Rink in Cardiff. He followed this up with two wins over Mike Morrison at the end of 1992, both on points, which led to a shot at the vacant Welsh area lightweight belt. The fight was held in Cardiff on 27 January 1993, his opponent was Swansea fighter Carl Hook. The contest was top of the bill, and the ten round bout went the full ten rounds before the decision was given to Bennett, making him the Welsh lightweight champion. After becoming champion, Bennett fought just four more times. He beat Vince Burns by knock-out in June 1995 but then lost by points to Dean Phillips in September. In October he successfully defended his Welsh belt when he handed Monmouth based boxer, Gareth Jordan, his first defeat. Jordan, who was 11 years younger than Bennett, was expected to take the title, but Bennett produced the performance of his career to retain his title. Bennett's final fight was in March 1996, a defeat to Karl Taylor. Bennett died in 1998, a victim of cancer.

He represented Vancouver-Point Grey in the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1937 to 1946 as a Conservative. He was born in Beamsville, Ontario and, in 1903, travelled west to Alberta, where he worked on a cattle ranch and as a night clerk in the Calgary post office. He later worked at placer mining, at railroad construction and as an employment agent. In 1906, he came to Vancouver, where he worked in a stationery store. Paton also spent some time in Prince Rupert where he worked at carpentry and surveying and helped set up the post office; he also was involved in surveying and mining in Whitehorse. From Vancouver, he moved to Eburne, where he became involved in newspaper publishing. In 1908, he purchased the Point Grey Gazette, later the Vancouver Courier. Paton also operated a store where he sold books and stationery and other assorted goods and offered printing, publishing and bookbinding services. He sold the newspaper at the beginning of World War I and enlisted in the 72nd Battalion of the Canadian Infantry, serving in Belgium and France. On his return to Canada in 1918, Paton re-purchased the Gazette. He was elected to the Point Grey municipal council in 1924 and served as reeve from 1925 to 1927. In 1925, Paton and others were charged with involvement in the kidnapping of Wong Foon Sing, accused by some of having murdered Janet Smith, but Paton was acquitted. In 1926, he married Cora May Fraser. Paton sold the Gazette later that year. In 1929, he became an alderman for the city of Vancouver. During World War II, Paton supported the movement of Japanese-Canadians into the province's interior; he also opposed giving them the right to vote.

It is low, spreading shrub with elliptic to egg-shaped leaves and small groups of cylindrical yellow flowers. Description Persoonia marginata is a low, spreading shrub which grows to a height of and a width of . Its young branches and leaves are moderately hairy but become glabrous with age. The leaves are arranged alternately and are elliptic to egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. They are long, wide and both surfaces are the same colour. The flowers are arranged in groups of between two and four mostly at the base of leaves. The groups have a stalk up to long, each flower with a moderately hairy pedicel which is long. The flower is composed of four yellow, slightly hairy tepals which are long, which are fused at the base but with the tips rolled back. The central style is surrounded by four yellow anthers which are also joined at the base with the tips rolled back, so that it resembles a cross when viewed end-on. The ovary is densely covered with grey hairs. Flowering occurs in January and February and is followed by fruit which are smooth green drupes. Taxonomy and naming Persoonia marginata was first formally described in 1830 by Robert Brown from an unpublished description by Allan Cunningham. Brown's description was published in Supplementum primum Prodromi florae Novae Hollandiae. The specific epithet (marginata) is a Latin word meaning \\"furnished with a border\\". Distribution and habitat This persoonia grows in woodland and forest on sandy soils derived from sandstone. It is found on the Central Tablelands and Central Coast but is most common in the Clandulla State Forest near Kandos. Small, isolated populations occur in other state forests and national parks including Turon National Park and Gardens of Stone National Park. Conservation Populations of Clandulla geebung are under threat from habitat loss and degradation due to forestry activities, road construction and recreational activities. They are also threatened by frequent fires, weed invasion and fungal diseases. The species is listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" under the Commonwealth Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC) Act and the New South Wales Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016.

The janitor recognizes on the police records the man who came out of the office, Mr. Breen. During the trial he sticks to what he has seen and what he has heard, though two different doctors testify that Mr. Breen is deaf and mute since birth. Young chronicle newspaperman Jerry Crane, in love with his good-looking girl colleague, has a feeling that Breen is a strange guy and tries to convince her not to go for interview to his house. Meantime a young broker tells him he has a hint, if he gets enough money for it. Breen comes to see the young broker before at half past eight the Burton comes to his house. A second time Mr. Breen asks for the time after seeing his victim. The puzzling case has the parallel love story of the two newspaper-people of the Chronicle.

He was a High Sheriff of Derbyshire and a Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire. Biography William Drury was born to William Drury and his wife in Nottingham. His fortune was made some years after the death of his cousin Robert Lowe in 1785. His cousin had died leaving the valuable estate of Locko Park to his youngest daughter Anne. Anne refused the inheritance as the conditions were that she marry someone from a short list of eligible bachelors chosen by her father. After taking legal advice it was decided that as Drury had a Lowe ancestor (a Great grandfather), he should inherit the lands and estate on the condition that he adopted the Lowe surname and paid Anne ¬£50,000. William was able to extend the lands and buildings he had inherited after he invested in the creation of the Derby Canal. The canal made the collieries at Denby much more viable as the coal could then be transported around the country by canal. It is also assisted the creation of potteries at Denby which started on Drury-Lowe's land.The notice of dissolution refers to \\" the Partnership heretofore carried on by the undersigned, Robert Charles George Brohier, and Joseph Jager, as Stone Bottle-Manufacturers, and otherwise, at a place called Jagersburgh, in the Parish of Denby, in the County of Derby, under the stile or firm of Brohier & Jager...\\" Drury-Lowe was also denied a male heir although he had a daughter in 1783 who was to go onto marry Robert Holden. The engagement of Robert and Anne had been agreed by Drury-Lowe but the couple became impatient over the date of the wedding and Anne eloped with her fianc√© and they were married at Gretna Green in August 1880 although the marriage was formalised in nearby Spondon on 31 August 1880. Robert was to inherit Locko Parke but never lived there as his mother-in-law outlived him. Drury Lowe became the High Sheriff of Derbyshire in 1795 as well as serving as captain of a troop of Derbyshire Volunteer Cavalry for nine years. Drury-Lowe was also made the Deputy Lieutenant of Derbyshire in 1797.

It is a prostrate shrub with rather fleshy, relatively large leaves and small groups of cylindrical yellow flowers. It is similar to P. daphnoides but has darker hairs on the young branches and smaller, less hairy flowers. P. procumbens in Cathedral Rock National Park Description Persoonia procumbens is a prostrate shrub which grows to a height of and has its young branches covered with rust-coloured hairs which are more or less pressed against the stem. The leaves are flat, spoon-shaped, wedge-shaped or egg-shaped with the narrower end towards the base. They are long, wide, have a few hairs when young but are glabrous when mature. The flowers are yellow and arranged singly or in groups of up to six on a rachis up to long. Each flower has an erect pedicel long which is covered with rust- coloured hairs. The flower is composed of four tepals long, which are fused at the base but with the tips rolled back. The central style is surrounded by four yellow anthers which are also joined at the base with the tips rolled back, so that it resembles a cross when viewed end-on. Flowering occurs from December to January and is followed by fruit which are green drupes.* Taxonomy and naming Persoonia procumbens was first formally described in 1991 by Peter Weston and Lawrie Johnson from a specimen collected near the turnoff from the Waterfall Way to the New England National Park. The description was published in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet (procumbens) is a Latin word meaning \\"prostrate\\" or \\"face downward\\", referring to the habit of this species. The species was formerly described as Persoonia prostrata subsp. C. Distribution and habitat This persoonia grows in woodland and forest near granite between Ebor and Backwater on the New England Tableland. The species has a ROTAP listing as \\"2RC-\\", meaning that it is rare but protected in a conservation reserve. Within Warra National Park it is found in two woodland plant communities, both on damp sand and sandy loam. Cultivation Persoonia procumbens has been grown readily in temperate climates. It prefers a well-drained soil in the garden, responds well to pruning and has horticultural potential as a rockery plant.

It is an erect shrub with linear to lance-shaped leaves, yellow, tube-shaped flowers and green, pear-shaped fruit. Description Persoonia bargoensis is an erect, bushy shrub that typically grows to a height of with a light covering of brownish hairs on its young branches. The leaves are arranged alternately along the stems, linear to lance-shaped, long, wide and paler on the lower surface. The flowers are arranged in groups of up to twenty in leaf axils or on the ends of branchlets that continue to grow after flowering. Each tube-shaped flower is borne on a pedicel long and has yellow tepals long. Flowering occurs from December to January and the fruit is a pear-shaped drupe up to long. Taxonomy Persoonia bargoensis was first formally described in 1991 by Peter Weston and Lawrie Johnson of the National Herbarium of New South Wales from material collected near Douglas Park in 1989. They had previously considered it an intermediate form between Persoonia nutans, that is found to the north, and P. oxycoccoides, found to the south. However further study found no evidence of intermediate forms between it and the other two species. Within the genus, P. bargoensis is classified in the Lanceolata group, a group of 58 closely related species with similar flowers but very different foliage. These species will often interbreed with each other where two members of the group occur. Distribution and habitat Bargo geebung is found in small scattered patches in an area bordered by Picton and Douglas Park to the north, Yanderra to the south, Cataract River to the east and Thirlmere to the west where it grows on Sydney sandstone and Wianamatta shale soils, above sea level. It grows in dry sclerophyll eucalypt forest, under forest red gum (Eucalyptus tereticornis) and broad-leaved red ironbark (E. fibrosa) with a grassy understory of kangaroo grass (Themeda triandra), or more open woodland with such trees as red bloodwood (Corymbia gummifera), scribbly gum (Eucalyptus sclerophylla), grey gum (E. punctata), narrow-leaved stringybark (E. sparsifolia) and small-leaved apple (Angophora bakeri) with a shrubby understory of plants such as wreath bush-pea (Pultenaea tuberculata). The increased light and lack of competing plants means the species adapts preferably to growing on road verges. Conservation status This geebung is classified as \\"vulnerable\\" under the Australian Government Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and as \\"endangered\\" under the New South Wales Government Biodiversity Conservation Act 2016. The main threats to the species include its small population size, habitat loss and fragmentation and inappropriate maintenance activities.

The repertoire of the theatre ‚Äì the staging of the best modern authors ‚Äì attracted the audience. A tone of performances made spectators feel exciting: it was confidential on the one hand and publicistic on the other. Then, in 1983 , a talented Leningrad director and favorite student of Georgy Tovstonogov, became a chief director of the Youth Theatre. The theatre kept its name, troupe and some performances, the theatre inner was changed: psychology, a life of human soul was interesting to Padve. In November 1989 Padve arranged for to become head of the Youth Theatre.Nile Guide Nowadays The Youth Theatre's strategy is that of a well-developed professional theatre. Its aesthetic credo reflects the creative efforts of its director Semyon Spivak, who views the territory of art as the territory of morality. He sees theatre's task as to enable the viewer to find correct answers to the turbulent questions of existence. Theatre raises us above the weight of reality and ¬´returns to man what is most true about him¬ª. \\"Once upon a time I thought the main thing for director is self-expression, but then I began to understand this mission in another way. It is hidden in evoking spectator's soul. For this reason there is a temple, but not many people visit it. But for a person is so important to feel he is not alone, that people are around, and everything has a supreme law. There are two ways of soul movement: religious and secular. We are engaged in the second.\\". (Semen Spivak) Spivak is also a theatre teacher. There is a highly-professional troupe in the theatre, since 1999 becoming bigger with graduated students from his acting- director's courses of Russian State Institute of Performing Arts.

During these years the theatre repertoire came out unique. It represents anthology of the world masterpieces. There can be found such names as Dostoevsky, Shakespeare, Gozzi, Chekhov, Ostrovsky, Scribe, Moli√®re, Bulgakov, Babel, Brecht. The theatre repertoire has wide genre diversity and stylistic features. There are presented not only traditional tragedy, comedy and drama, but also tragicomedy, melodrama etc. Labeling the genre in the program of performance under its name, the theatre often departs from the usual formula, offering spectators options such as, for example, \\"nostalgia\\", \\"family history\\", \\"romantic metamorphosis\\", \\"an anthology of passion\\", \\"a vivid portrait of the play\\", \\"melodrama with quotations towards primitivism\\", and others. The Theatre on the Fontanka never focuses on the tastes of the mass audience while selecting plays for performances. The theatre sees its goal as educate the taste of spectators. The theatre's mission can be characterized as: \\"To talk easily and clearly about deep things. To help a person to find harmony.

The other key figure in the company was Lowthian Bell, son of Thomas Bell; he became perhaps the best known ironmaster in England. As Bell Brothers, the firm continued until 1931, when it was taken over by rival Dorman Long. History =Founders= The company was named after William Losh, Thomas Wilson, and Thomas Bell. William Losh (1770 Carlisle‚Äì4 August 1861, Ellison Place, Newcastle) came from a rich family that owned coal mines in Northeast England. He was educated in Hamburg, and trained in Newcastle, Sweden and France. He married Alice Wilkinson of Carlisle on 1 March 1798 at Gateshead.Losh Family History, The Archers, the Goodmans and Associated Families website He was a friend of the explorer Alexander von Humboldt and a one-time business partner of rail pioneer George Stephenson. His brother James Losh was also a partner in the firm, and kept a diary recording his anxieties about the firm during the Napoleonic wars. Thomas Wilson (1773‚Äì9 May 1858) of Low Fell, Gateshead joined the Losh, Lubbin counting house. In 1807, Wilson became a partner and the firm took the name Losh, Wilson and Bell.Thomas Wilson FCDurham & Tyneside Dialect Group: Word Lists: Thomas Wilson's Pitman's Pay In 1810 he married Mrs Fell of Kirklinton. Thomas Bell, (5 March 1784 ‚Äì 20 April 1845) partner, was married to Katherine Lowthian of Newbiggin, Cumberland on 25 March 1815. Bell's father was a blacksmith.Charles Mosley, editor, Burke's Peerage, Baronetage & Knightage, 107th edition, 3 volumes (Wilmington, Delaware, U.S.A.: Burke's Peerage (Genealogical Books) Ltd, 2003), volume 1, page 331. =Origins: from alkali to iron= The firm's origins can be traced back to 1790 when Archibald Dundonald, with John and William Losh, experimented on how to produce soda from salt. In about 1793 they opened a works at Bells Close, near Newcastle. Dundonald sent William Losh to Paris to study Nicolas Leblanc's process for making soda from salt.Grace's Guide: Walker Ironworks In 1807, the Loshes opened an alkali works at Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland. It was the first in England to use the Leblanc process. Dundonald left the partnership and the business continued as Walker Alkali Works. Losh, Wilson & Bell's first ironworks was founded in 1809 at Walker, beside the alkali works, carrying out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines.Tyne Tugs & Tug Builders: Engine Builders By 1818, George Stephenson's original wooden wagonway was completely relaid with cast-iron edge-rails made in collaboration between Stephenson, who owned the patent, and Losh, Wilson and Bell.Institution of Mechanical Engineers: George Stephenson (1781‚Äì1848) Around 1821, George Stephenson was briefly a partner in the Walker Ironworks. =Wealth= Lowthian Bell, by Frank Bramley. National Railway Museum, York In 1827 a rolling mill capable of 100 tons of bar iron per week was installed at the Walker Ironworks; in the same year, Losh, Wilson and Bell's Walker foundry was listed in Parson and White's gazetteer of Durham and Northumberland as a steam engine manufacturer. In 1833, the iron puddling process was installed at Walker. In 1835, while working as an inspector of construction on the Whitby & Pickering Railway, Thomas Wilson noted the presence of ironstone in a railway cutting at Grosmont, and arranged for drift mines to exploit the find; the new railway carried the ore to Whitby. In that year, at the age of nineteen, Thomas Bell's son Lowthian Bell entered the firm's Newcastle office under his father. In 1836 he joined his father at the firm's ironworks at Walker.The Peerage: Bell, Sir Isaac Lowthian. William Arthur Bone, 1912. In 1838, a second mill for rolling rails was added, run by the engineer John Vaughan (who went on to found Bolckow Vaughan); he strongly influenced Lowthian Bell to become an ironmaster. In the same year, The Athenaeum Journal reported that the Losh, Wilson & Bell works was manufacturing tin and iron plate in large quantities, along with iron bars for making railway-carriage wheels. The firm's adjacent alkali works was one of several such operations on the Tyne that were collectively producing more than 250 tons of crystallised soda and about 100 tons of soda ash weekly. The journal called William Losh \\"the father of soda-making on the Tyne\\" and described him as the head of the firm (although it was a partnership). In 1842, the shortage of pig iron persuaded Bell to install its own blast furnace for smelting mill cinder; this was a key decision, enabling the firm to expand. Only two years later, in 1844, the firm installed a second furnace at Walker for Cleveland Ironstone from Grosmont, six years before the boom in Cleveland iron when Vaughan and Marley discovered ironstone in the Eston Hills in 1850. From 1849, Losh, Wilson and Bell were subcontractors on the Newcastle-Gateshead High Level Bridge, responsible for constructing the bridge approaches.Tyne Bridges at Gateshead. Losh, Wilson and Bell constructed the approaches for the Newcastle-Gateshead High Level Bridge, c. 1852 On 25 January 1851, Lowthian BellInstitution of Mechanical Engineers: President, Sir Lowthian Bell left the partnership with William Losh, Thomas Wilson, Catherine Bell, Thomas Bell and John Bell. The business at that time was described in the London Gazette as \\"Iron Manufacturers, and Ship and Insurance Brokers, under the style or firm of Losh, Wilson, and Bell\\". He went on to have a career in chemistry and politics, becoming a member of parliament among many other distinctions. On 8 October 1855, there was a serious boiler explosion at the Walker Iron Works, which killed at least seven workers. According to a contemporary account, the boiler > unfurled like a sail, was blown upwards, carrying with it two roofings of > the sheds, and blowing down two furnaces, with their chimneys, and > scattering the molten metal and red hot bricks around, while one end of it > was hurled into the midst of the works, and the other about 200 yards over > the hill top, into the lumber-yard. All the dead were aged between 19 and 33, and the event created something of a sensation at the time. In 1857, John Marley, in his account of the Cleveland Ironstone, described the Bell Ironworks as follows:John Marley, Cleveland Ironstone, 1857. > These iron-works, situate on the Tyne, and belonging to Messrs. Losh, > Wilson, & Bell, originally consisted of only one furnace, being the first > blast furnace that was specially erected for this bed of ironstone (in > connection with Scotch, and other ores, for mixing), viz., about the year > 1842 or 1843, and which ironstone was purchased from the aforesaid mines > belonging to Mrs. Clark, in the Whitby district, the first cargo being sent > in June or July, 1843, since which time these works have been increased by > one extra furnace, built for the Whitby district ironstone in 1844, and by > other three [at Port Clarence] for the north part of Cleveland, about 1852, > making now a total of five furnaces. Cornish beam engine, Springhead Pumping Station: 90\\" engine by Bells Lightfoot =Bells, Goodman = From 1869 at the latest, the company owning the Walker Engine Works was Bells, Goodman & Co. In that year the firm made the tunnelling shield and iron castings to line the Tower subway tunnels. In 1871 the firm made pumping and winding engines for Seghill Colliery. In 1875 it made machinery to condense smoke and gases for Clyde Lead Works of Glasgow. =Bells, Lightfoot= In 1875, the Bells, Goodman partnership was dissolved when Alfred Goodman retired. The firm became known as Bells, Lightfoot & Co. In 1876 it supplied a 90\\" Cornish beam engine for Springhead Pumping Station near Anlaby in the East Riding of Yorkshire; it had an unusual box-section wrought iron beam, and continued running until 1952. On 30 November 1876, Thomas Bell Lightfoot, Managing Partner, was granted a patent for his developments on machines for squeezing metals into shape. However, on 28 August 1883, Thomas Bell moved to Bilbao, Spain, where he continued to describe himself as an Ironmaster, and by mutual consent his partnership with Henry Bell and Thomas Bell the younger was dissolved. The deed was witnessed on 7 December 1883. =Bell Brothers= Painting of Bell Brothers Ironworks at Port Clarence by Albert Goodwin By 1873, Bell Brothers owned 9 coal mines in County Durham and Yorkshire. There were 10 mines in 1882; in 1888 the \\"Clarence Salt Works\\" was also recorded. In 1896 and 1902 the company had 11 mines. In 1914 there are 12; in 1921 there are 14. The 1881‚Äì1891 Arts and Crafts classical style Bell Brothers office building at Zetland Road in Middlesbrough was designed by architect Philip Webb; it was his only commercial development. According to English Heritage it is architecturally the most important building in Middlesbrough.Picture of the Dorman Long building In 1903, Lowthian Bell, then aged 87, sold a majority holding of the Bell companies to the rival firm Dorman Long. It was not a comfortable merger. Bell Brothers, along with the plate maker Consett Iron Company and another family ironmaking firm of Northeast England, Bolckow Vaughan, Further, as regards the Bells and the Dormans, Bell Brothers was recorded in the Colliery Year Book and Coal Trades Directory of 1923 as having an annual output of 600,000 tons of coal for coking and manufacturing. Sir Hugh Bell was chairman and managing director; Arthur Dorman and Charles Dorman were directors. That same year, Bell Brothers, described in the Sydney Morning Herald as \\"owners of coal and ironstone mines and blast furnaces and rolling mills\\", was finally merged completely with Dorman Long. Sir Arthur Dorman was chairman; both Hugh Bell and his son Maurice Bell were among the directors. When Arthur Dorman died in 1931, Hugh Bell, aged 87, briefly became chairman of 'Dorman versus Bell'; he died on 29 June 1931. Wages and social conditions John Roby Leifchild wrote a report in 1842 for the Children's Employment Commission entitled \\"Employment of Children and Young Persons in the Collieries, Lead Mines, and Iron Works of Northumberland and the North of Durham; and on the Condition, Treatment, and Education of such Children and Young Persons\\". Leifchild found that Losh, Wilson & Bell paid its workers 30 to 36 shillings per week for a scrap-puddler; ¬£2 5 shillings per week for a pudler; 18 shillings per week for a plate mill-furnace man; and 25 shillings per week for an engineman. The boiler engineer's family of wife and four children spent 18 shillings per week on provisions and 3 shillings per week on rent, leaving only 4 shillings for all other expenditure. In sport, an iron puddler, Robert Chambers of the company's Walker works, won the sculling championship at the 1857 Thames Regatta. The heavy work stirring the iron was said to have strengthened his arms and shoulders. Chambers also won the return match, held on the Tyne on 19 April 1859, even after a collision with a moored boat left him a hundred yards behind.Whitehead, Ian.

Itoi bats left-handed and throws right-handed. He played for team Japan in WBC 2013, and hit for Japan in games against Brazil (4th batter) and China (5th batter). Career =Early life= Itoi was a pitcher during his time as a student, and was the ace pitcher for Kinki University during his 4th year, where he finished the spring league with a 5‚Äì0 record with 2 shutouts, and won the MVP and Best Pitcher award. He was also included in the Best Nine. He finished his university career with a 9‚Äì1 record. =Nippon Ham Fighters= Itoi was drafted into the Fighters in the fall of 2003, and was considered a power pitcher, being able to pitch 151 km/h (94 mph) fastball but has control problems and were unable to muster up decent breaking balls. He was also marred with injury and spent 2 years in the ni-gun (Japanese equivalent of the minor league). Although Itoi had problems developing as a good pitcher in the pros, his outstanding batting sense, running speed (50m in 5 seconds), and strong throwing arm prompted Fighters GM Shigeru Takada to convert him into an outfielder. Just 5 months after converting into an outfielder, Itoi won the Eastern League's Monthly MVP award, hitting .397 in September 2006. Itoi collected his first hit and stolen base in Ichigun level in the 2007 season, but spent most time in Niggun, having only played 7 games at Ichigun level. In 2008, Itoi was the Opening Day's starting left fielder, but injury again put him out of action. He bounced back near the end of the season, however, and hit his first home run soon after. He was the lead off batter for Fighters during that year's Climax Series, and was defensively outstanding. In 2009, Itoi replaced Hichori Morimoto as Fighter's everyday starting center field. He moved up the batting order as the season progress, hitting in the two-hole and even as the third batter when Atsunori Inaba was absent. Itoi won the Monthly MVP award in June, and was selected for the first time to play in the All Star Game. He ended the year hitting .306 with 15 home runs, 24 stolen bases, and a league high 40 doubles, and won his first Golden Glove award. Itoi continued to be an integral part of the Fighters, winning his second Golden Glove in 2010 and ended the year hitting .309 with 15 home runs and 26 stolen bases. After the NPB switched the official game ball into the pitcher friendly ball that lead to a league-wide fall in batting statistics, Itoi continued to flourish in the 2011 season, hitting .319 with 11 home runs and 31 stolen bases, and a league high .411 OBP (the only player with OBP of more than .400 that year in whole of NPB) mainly as the third batter. He won his third straight Golden Glove that year. In 2012, Itoi switched from center field to right field as Taiwanese Dai-Kang Yang was slotted into center field. Itoi was not in his best during the first half of the season, hitting .289 with 2 home runs. He started to pick up in the second half of the season, hitting .380 with 3 home runs in September to win the Monthly MVP award. He ended the year with .304 batting average, 9 homers, 22 stolen base, and second straight year of league high .404 OBP, also winning his fourth Golden Glove. Itoi expressed interest at the end of the season to be posted to the Major Leagues, but was instead traded to the Orix Buffaloes in a 5 player deal on January 25, 2013. =Orix Buffaloes= Itoi was involved in a surprising 5 player trade at the end of the 2012 season, which saw him moving to Pacific League rivals Orix Buffaloes. He hit a homer against his former club Fighters on 11 May 2013 to join the ranks of players to have hit at least a home run against each NPB team. At the end of the 2016 season, Itoi announced his decision to test the free agent market. The Hanshin Tigers were the most persistent team, and after 9 days of negotiations, he agreed to leave his former club and move to the Central League. =Hanshin Tigers= He selected . International career Itoi was selected to play for Japan national baseball team in the 2013 World Baseball Classic, and started all 3 games as right fielder in the first pool round, batting cleanup in the first 2 games. He is amongst the most consistent batters for Team Japan, getting a hit in each game. During the second pool round, Itoi replaced the ineffective Hisayoshi Chono in center field and continued his batting consistency, hitting a double against Chinese Taipei (Also Team Japan's only second extra base hit up until that moment, with the other also provided by Itoi) and hit a 3-run home run in the mulling of Netherlands. In the semifinal round, however, they lost to upstart Puerto Rico 3‚Äì1, thus preventing the team from advancing to the Championship round.

Plot  Don Hollander (Kevin Dobson) is a Los Angeles married father of two teens, entrenched in a midlife crisis. Once happily married and in top condition, working as a space engineer, Don is now unemployed and constantly fights with his wife Evelyn (Melendy Britt) over how to discipline their rebellious children - Evelyn feeling they should accept that they are sexually active and using drugs, whereas Don has more conservative thoughts. When he receives a letter informing him about the twentieth reunion of his high school 3000 miles away from Los Angeles, Don is encouraged by Evelyn to attend it, feeling that they could use a break from each other. Going through the year book, he immediately contacts his high school sweetheart Peggy Sager (Joanna Cassidy), who is now a divorced mother and excited to catch up with Don. Though thrilled to see her, Peggy's aging looks remind Don of his own decline and he becomes more attracted to her 17-year-old daughter Anne (Linda Hamilton), a high school cheerleader who is in a relationship with the basketball team's star player Steve Cowan (Nick Cassavetes). Don quickly grows accustomed to his home town, where he is worshiped by the townspeople for being the high school team's star player in 1959, shared with his pals Vincent Scozzola (George DiCenzo), Walker Hanson (Rick Lenz) and Jack Owens (Nicholas Pryor). All men try to re-live their glory years and decide to compete against the current high school basketball team. Meanwhile, despite better judgment, Peggy sleeps with Don on his first night there. The next morning, Don gets more acquainted with Anne, who has developed a crush on him and even accompanies him to meet with his father Bob (Lew Ayres). She even distances herself from Steve as a way of spending more time with Don. Throughout the film, Don multiple times shows his discontent in getting older and criticizes others for not being young. He even attends a high school prom to dance with Anne, shocking Peggy who suspects that a romance is going on. Don further upsets one with conservative thoughts, such as his opinion on homosexuality, which saddens his closeted friend Walker. Simultaneously, he finds in John Wiepert (George Wyner) the fifth player of his team.

It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2010. History Following the formation, by eight Harrisburg residents, of a Methodist Society in February 1889, that society's leadership founded a Sunday school on May 12 of that same year, and began providing spiritual education to 50 participants on a regular basis at a room above the Rife's & Reese's grocery store on Woodbine Street. To accommodate a growing congregation, the Rev. J.S. Wilcox spearheaded efforts to build a new chapel. The cornerstone for that new building was laid on May 11, 1890, and the building, officially known as the Curtin Heights Episcopal Church, was dedicated on December 1891 on the site of the long since demolished Camp Curtin, a major Union Army training camp during the American Civil War.\\"Church History.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Camp Curtin-Memorial Mitchell United Methodist Church, retrieved online August 7, 2019.

Destroyed by fire on December 30, 1894, a new church was built by the congregation on the same site. Completed under the leadership of Dr. S. Fasick, its doors were open by July of 1895; it was then formally dedicated on December 15 of that same year.\\"Church History,\\" Camp Curtin-Memorial Mitchell United Methodist Church. The church's name was officially changed to Camp Curtin Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church by an amendment to the church's charter in September 1914.

Dragonfly continues to expand the game around the world and plans to expand into the Middle Eastern, Indian, and Russian markets. The Indonesian version of the game was discontinued in March 2012. Soldier Front is currently being published by Aeria Games for North American users. In October 2009, a European server was added to this version of the game. The North American version of the game has been transferred over to Aeria Games due to the acquisition of ijji by Aeria Games. In January 2016, Aeria Games announced that Soldier Front would be shut down on January 29, 2016. Gameplay Special Force provides several game modes including team battle (bomb planting, escaping, object stealing, etc.), single battle, team death match, horror mode, and more. Most modes consist of a red team and a blue team, with the exceptions of single battle, training, and horror mode. The game allows for a maximum of 16 users to be in the same room playing together. Players have the ability to purchase from a range of character forces including French GIGN, German GSG 9, Malaysian PASKAL, Republic of Korea Marine Corps, US Army Delta Force, Russian Spetsnaz, and mor. One is also able to rent equipment for speed and armor. A range of weapons are available including rifles, sniper rifles, machine guns, handguns, shotguns, melee, and grenades. Weapons have durability and must be repaired often. Weapons are not mod-able like other first person shooters, but once they are purchased, they are permanent and stay in inventory until they are resold by the player. Players rank up after receiving enough experience points, gained after each match, with bonus rewards at certain ranks. =Graphics update= On July 14, 2009, Dragonfly provided a patch to the Korean version which had a completely redesigned UI and reorganized game items for the celebration of the game's 5th anniversary. Along with this, many of the older weapons graphics looked outdated and were updated to a new and sleeker look to compete with newer games. This patch was applied to all other versions of the game in the following months. Game Modes Special Force currently has 11 modes available in the North American version of the game. * Training ‚Äì Targets are placed everywhere on the map where players can shoot them down. This mode is used for practicing aim and strategies. * Single Battle ‚Äì It is free for all and the player who reaches the set number of points wins. * Team Battle ‚Äì Red team must complete the objective while blue team must prevent red team from doing so. Depending on the map, the objective could be planting the bomb, escaping the map, or retrieving an object. * Clan Battle ‚Äì Same as Team Battle except the red team must be all from the same clan and also the same goes for blue team. Clans are not able to face each other. This mode is often played in 5 vs 5. * Team Death Match ‚Äì The team that reaches 100 points first wins the round. Each kill grants 2 points and special kills will grant extra points. * CTC ‚Äì One player from each team is selected as the Captain who will be granted extra HP, along with an over-sized head. The team to defeat the opponent's Captain wins the round. * CTC 2 ‚Äì Similar to CTC, except every player will be a Captain. The team to defeat all the Captains on the opposing team wins the round. * Horror Mode ‚Äì Each round, some players are selected as zombies. Zombies must kill all the humans while humans try to stay alive until the time limit is up. Humans that get killed before the time limit will turn into a zombie. Zombies win the round if no humans are left alive and humans win the round when at least one survives by the time limit. * Sniper ‚Äì Players are only allowed to use sniper rifles and knives on this mode's exclusive maps. The team that kills all the opposing team's members wins the round. With a premium item, there is an option to allow secondary weapons. * Rage Mode ‚Äì The team that reaches the target points first wins the match.

On 11 November (or later/earlier for reasons of appointment) children (usually in kindergarten and elementary school age) walk along the streets holding colourful, often self-made lanterns (Laternenumzug, ‚ÄòLantern Pageant‚Äô). Laternelaufen is slightly competing with Halloween, but they are different enough to coexist.  Memorial to St. Martin  Legend has it that St. Martin, a soldier, gave a beggar the half of his soldier's coat to protect the man from freezing to death. Afterwards St. Martin became a bishop in order to help poor people. While this story is commonly known among German children and told in connection with this tradition, it does not explain the custom of promenading along the streets with lanterns. Several reasons why it is done this way can be found (s. Origin of the Tradition). While Laternelaufen is a memorial to St. Martin and therefore usually takes place on 11 November, in some regions of Germany (that are rather Protestant) it may take place already on 10 November, because it is mixed up with the celebration of Martin Luther's birthday (Martinisingen). In some regions there is no fixed day. Depending on the needs of the particular organizers celebrations can often take place on different days in the same city. In Catholic regions Laternelaufen is also called Sankt Martinsumzug (‚ÄòSaint Martin's Pageant‚Äô) focusing on the aspect of sharing. In Austria, the same tradition is called Laternenfest. During Laternelaufen children often sing Martinslieder / Martinilieder (‚ÄòMartin songs‚Äô) that glorify St. Martin's act of sharing or songs about their lanterns.  Origin  It is not quite clear why the stories concerning St. Martin led to the custom of Laternelaufen.cf. a discussion in the forum of the online dictionary LEO: The symbolism behind Laternelaufen Maybe just like Advent wreaths Laternelaufen is a symbolic act of ‚Äòbringing light into the world‚Äô. It is also possible that one tradition got conflated with another or that the lanterns are remains of a necessary custom due to the lack of daylight in autumn and winter. Festivals of light (a category Laternelaufen could be classified into) can be found all over the world and in many cultures / traditions (e.g. Diwali, Chanukka, Saint Lucy's Day and Loi Krathong)  Organization  Today, Laternelaufen is usually organized (privately) by parents or (publicly) by kindergartens and schools, parishes or even political parties.e.g. SPD: Laternenumzug der SPD Dornbreite The ways often lead through forests (if any available in the neighbourhood) since there the streets are not continuously lit so that the lanterns are the only sources of light. The procession is accompanied by parents, group leaders etc., for official pageants the organizers often also hire somebody to play St. Martin, who is displayed as a bearded man in a medieval soldier's uniform wearing a long red cape or cloak, often riding on a horse in front of the children.  Comparison to Halloween  Laternelaufen and Halloween cannot be compared although their celebration dates are around the same days (31 October and 11 November). Their origin is different and Laternelaufen does not contain any kind of masquerades, trick-or-treating or similar aspects that are commonly associated with Halloween.

MMM builds a translation chain prototype with Moses + IRSTLM + RandLM + MGIZA. The first version of Moses for Mere Mortals was published in November 2009, and it has been updated and tested on Linux - Ubuntu distributions. MMM is available in the GitHub Project Hosting website. Overview Its main aims are to: * help build a prototype of a translation chain for the real world; * guide the first steps of users that are just beginning to use Moses; * enable a simple and quick evaluation of Moses; * enable the user to do his/her own translations without having to trust third (translating) parties; * integrate machine translation and translation memories. Even though the main thrust is centred on Linux, two Windows add-ins help to make the bridge from MS Windows to Linux and then back from Linux. General features Overview Moses allows the training of corpora where every word is presented together with, for instance, its respective lemma and/or part of speech tag (‚Äúfactored training‚Äù). The scripts do not cover this type of training. MMM consists of seven scripts for Linux, thoroughly tested with Ubuntu (12.04 and 14.04, 64-bit): * Install: To install in Ubuntu the packages on which both Moses and Moses for Mere Mortals depend. * Create: To compile Moses and the other required packages with a single command. * Make-test- files: To extract from the original corpus a corpus for training, files for tuning and files for testing the training results. * Train: To train the language pairs needed, as Moses is language-independent and can work with any language/alphabet. * Translate: To produce machine translations of new documents. * Score: To automatically evaluate Moses translations against a human translation taken as a gold standard, using BLEU and NIST metrics algorithms, in order to have an idea of the level of performance. * Transfer training-to-another-location: To transfer engines/trainings to other folders in the same computer or to a different computer. MMM comes with a 200,000-segment demonstration corpus ‚Äî which is too small to do justice to the qualitative results achievable with Moses, but capable of giving a realistic view of the relative duration of the steps involved and useful to test whether the installation was correctly done. In order to get good results, one generally needs a corpus with several million segments. Each orthogonal corpus consists of two strictly aligned UTF-8 files, one in the source language and the other in the target language. No grammar knowledge is required, though some language pairs give better results than others. In a general way, morphologically rich languages give worse results. Add-ins MMM also contains (for Windows and Linux): * Extract_TMX_Corpus: An application for the conversion of one or more files in TMX format into two parallel and perfectly aligned files (in the source and target languages) needed for the training of a language pair. * Moses2TMX: An application to align originals and Moses translations and to package each file in a TMX file with specific attributes so that Moses translations are identified as MT and as having been translated by Moses and can be used with a translation memory tool, with a penalty relative to human memories. MMM also contains the file Nonbreaking_prefix.pt, a list of abbreviations specific to the Portuguese language, based on English and German versions already available with the Moses package. Software features Moses for Mere Mortals also has some original features: * It removes control characters from the input files (these can crash a training); * From the corpus, it extracts 2 training files, 2 tuning files and 2 test files (one in the source language and one in the target language) with randomly selected, non-consecutive segments that are erased from the corpus files; * A new training does not interfere with the files of a previous training; * A new training reuses, as much as possible, the files created in previous trainings (thus saving time); * It stops with an informative message if any of the phases of training (language model building, recaser training, corpus training, memory mapping, tuning or training test) doesn‚Äôt produce the expected results; * It can limit the duration of tuning to a specified number of iterations; * It can generate, in a single step, the BLEU and NIST scores for one translation or a set of translations present in a directory (either for each whole document or for each segment of each document); * It allows the transfer of corpus trainings to another computer or to another installation in the same computer; * It allows the mkcls, GIZA and MGIZA parameters to be controlled through parameters in the train script; * It allows selected parameters in the Moses scripts and the Moses decoder to be controlled through the train and translate scripts.

Plot After an introduction by Gus while he retrieves ingredients for his hairy turkey sandwiches (which is a Leg from Vincent Price's corpse that he sliced in half), Donny stops by the guy's table at The Broken Stool where he annoys them with his sense of humor by telling some bad jokes. Back at the house, Rallo is preparing for his first sleepover at his friend's Walt's house but Cleveland Brown Jr. is disappointed as he is not allowed to come. At school, Roberta is taking a break from Federline Jones while he takes his SATs preparation classes when she catches a glimpse of Edwin Mullins, a new student. Noticing his pale, dark looks and a trickle of pizza sauce dribbling from his lips, Roberta gets the idea that Edwin could be a vampire. Introducing herself, Roberta ignores hints from Edwin that he is not interested in her. At the sleepover, Rallo gets frightened and calls Cleveland to come get him. Cleveland tries to pass the task off to Donna but she orders him out to get Rallo himself. Cleveland teases Rallo about being scared and picks up a hitch-hiker to scare Rallo further but kicks the hitch-hiker out of the car when he tickles Rallo without paying any attention to Cleveland. Later at The Broken Stool, the guys win a jack-o-lantern contest by being the only ones Gus knows and Terry Kimple invites everyone except Donny back to his house for a celebration party. At the Kimple's house, Cleveland gets scared by being in a strange place and calls Donna. When she picks him up, she makes him get in the back of the car where he gets frightened by Rallo and they continue to argue over who is more scared. The arguing continues into trick-or-treat where, thanks to Donny's annoying jokes, they fail to get candy from Wally's house after Wally forbids giving candy to anyone. When the kids complain to Cleveland that Donny ruined their fun, Cleveland tells him to leave. The arguing over who is braver starts again with Cleveland and Rallo darting into traffic until Donna grabs them and forces them to stop in frustration. Roberta tries to attract Edwin by jumping off of a cliff into a lake like she saw in the movies, but is rescued by a moonlight swimmer named Caleb. Roberta gets the idea that he is a werewolf and has to think over who she wants to be with. Donna drives Rallo and Cleveland to the abandoned McCafferty house and forces them to be brave by spending the night in the house together. As they try to settle in for the night, Cleveland and Rallo hear noises and investigate, discovering spooky surprises that Donna and Jr. planted as traps to watch on a webcam. As they watch, they are unaware that Donny is slipping into the house to exact revenge for being snubbed. When Donna gets up for some snacks, Donny bursts in looking for Cleveland. When they tell him that Cleveland is not there, Donny decides to start by killing Donna and Jr. instead. Back at the McCafferty house, Cleveland and Rallo decide to call a truce and leave together. Pausing briefly at a driving range while stalling for time, Cleveland and Rallo decide to head home together. At a Halloween party, while trying to decide if either Caleb or Edwin should become her lover, Roberta has them go into a room to fight for the title. Nervous about what is going on, Roberta has her friend Anna look in on them and finds out that the two of them are having sex together and chastises Roberta for not noticing sooner. Back at the house, Cleveland and Rallo arrive to find Donny disguised as Donna who he has tied up with Jr. Donny attacks Cleveland with his axe. While they struggle, Rallo sprays the fluid from Cleveland Jr.'s \\"WD-40\\" costume onto the floor, enabling Cleveland to force Donny out the window to his death as he screams about hating black people. Cleveland ends by noting that they were pretty brave after all. Things come to a close with a musical number as Gus hauls away Donny's body.

After splitting up in 1998, going on to side projects Kyoko and Bluebear, they re-formed in 2004, releasing several more albums before splitting again in 2008. History Singer Guitarist Andrew Arthur Jarrett started Beatnik Filmstars when the band he was previously in (The Groove Farm) split up.Strong, Martin C. (2003) The Great Indie Discography, Canongate, , p. 617-8 Formed in 1990, the first line up also featured former Groove Farm members Jon Kent (guitar) and Jeremy (Jez) Butler (Drums) along with bass player Andy Henderson. The band's first album Maharishi was released in 1991.Cramer, Stephen \\"Beatnik Filmstars Biography\\", Allmusic, retrieved 26 November 2011 It found them getting lumped into the shoegazing scene, with songs that featured loud/quiet/loud passages, and swirly guitar sounds. But Jarrett was more influenced by US sounding bands and the band soon broke away from their 'shoegaze' phase. Their second and third albums (Laid Back & English and Astronaut House) found them experimenting with more Lo-Fi sounds and guitar noise.Abebe, Nitsuh \\"Laid Back & English Review\\", Allmusic, retrieved 27 November 2011 Released on the UK indie label La Di da Records, and newly formed La Di Da/Caroline Records in the USA. The band had now changed line up with John Austin and Tim Rippington (formerly of The Flatmates and 5 Year Plan) both joining as guitarists replacing Kent. And Ian Roughley taking over drums. While Henderson was replaced by Jez Francis on bass. By the time the band had released their next album Beezer (a collection of singles and sessions) on the US label Slumberland, Tom Adams had replaced Roughley on drums. The band's first US tour was supporting The Flaming Lips after hooking up with US management Hellfire. The next album Phase 3 was to be one of the band's biggest sellers. Released on their own Mobstar label in the UK and the independent No Life Records in the US, reviews commented on the lo-fi recording quality and the pop style songs, with one reviewer calling the band \\"the English Guided By Voices\\", and others making similar comparisons.Haag, Stephen (2006) \\"Beatnik Filmstars: In Great Shape\\", PopMatters, 23 June 2006, retrieved 27 November 2011Tacopino, Joe (2007) \\"Beatnik Filmstars: Barking (A Collection of Oddities)\\", PopMatters, 9 January 2007, retrieved 26 November 2011 The band were also compared to Sebadoh, Pavement, Sonic Youth, and The Fall.Woodlief, Mark \\"Beatnik Filmstars\\", Trouser Press, retrieved 26 November 2011Burt, Stephen (1997) \\"Beatnik Filmstars / Phase 3\\", CMJ New Music Monthly, April 1997, p. 28, retrieved 27 November 2011Swihart, Stanton \\"Beezer Review\\", Allmusic, retrieved 27 November 2011 John Peel was a big supporter of the band on their home turf and between 1994 and 1998 they recorded five Peel sessions,\\"Beatnik Filmstars\\", Keeping It Peel, BBC, retrieved 26 November 2011 as well as once being invited to sit in and chat with him during one of his broadcasts. The next album In Hospitalable was released on US label Merge Records. Again reviews were mostly positive, although most referred to the album title as In Hospitable!. This was followed by one more album Boss Disque again released on Merge Records and also the German label Noise-o-lution. Their second tour of the US found them supporting Merge label mates and label owners Superchunk. As well as one show with Guided by Voices. The band's albums were selling well, and making headway in the college radio charts, but the band were finding it a struggle back on home ground. During a tour of Germany in 1998 the band cracked and fell to pieces. Jarrett, Adams and Austin went on to record three albums of lo-fi quietcore music under the name Kyoko. But these failed to sell well despite getting good reviews. Jarrett also recorded as Bluebear, releasing an album and two EPs in 2002. =Reformation= In 2004 Jarrett brought Beatnik Filmstars back to life with Rippington and Adams back in place along with new members Geoff Gorton (bass) and Maurice Roache (keyboards). The band released their attempt at a pure pop record on the UK's Track & Field Indie label. Jarrett later described it as 'a half successful album'. Another collection album Barking followed on The International Lo-Fi Underground, collecting together various singles and unused tracks. The next album Shenaniganism (Tape Hiss & Other Imperfections) was released in 2007,Padilla, Sean (2008) \\"Beatnik Filmstars: Shenaniganism (Tape Hiss and Other Imperfections\\", PopMatters, 31 January 2008, retrieved 27 November 2011 with the first 500 CD's each coming with a hand made sleeve. But the band was once again beginning to feel boxed into style and the band's final album The Purple Fez Club 72 saw them breaking away to a more mellow sound, with hints of alt country seeping into their pop songs, the band now being compared with Lambchop.\\"Beatnik Filmstars at Fuel Bar, Manchester\\", Clash, 5 February 2009, retrieved 26 November 2011 Again reviews were mostly favourable, but the band were finding it hard to connect with any labels or people with clout enough to help them move forward, so after one final download only album, Broken Bones, Jarrett called time for good. Now working under the name Our Arthur, Jarrett continues to write and perform pop songs and includes in live shows, songs from his time with both Beatnik Filmstars and The Groove Farm.

He was a great admirer of Bliss's classification and used most of his life to develop a revised edition (BC2), a task he did not fulfil. The BC2 preserved the general structure of BC1, but the revised edition (BC2) is to all intents and purposes a new scheme of classification, realising the hopes of the Classification Research Group for the development of a new British scheme of classification.

Fox Television Stations, Inc., 567 U.S. 239 (2012), was a decision by the Supreme Court of the United States regarding whether the U.S. Federal Communications Commission's scheme for regulating speech is unconstitutionally vague. The Supreme Court excused the broadcasters from paying fines levied for what the FCC had determined indecency, in a majority opinion delivered by Justice Anthony Kennedy. The Supreme Court had previously issued an opinion in the case in 2009 addressing the nature of the fine itself, without addressing the restriction on indecent speech. Initial case The case entered the Supreme Court's docket in October 2007 and specifically concerns obscene language broadcast on the Fox television network from two Billboard Music Awards shows from 2002 and 2003. In the 2002 show, while accepting her Lifetime Achievement Award, Cher said \\"fuck 'em\\" regarding people who she believed criticized her; in the 2003 show, presenter Nicole Richie stated regarding her television show: ‚ÄúWhy do they even call it The Simple Life? Have you ever tried to get cow shit out of a Prada purse? It‚Äôs not so fucking simple.‚Äù In 2004, after two instances of fleeting expletives on the Billboard Music Awards show in 2002 and 2003, Federal Communications Commission (FCC) changed its rules on expletives to prohibit \\"single uses of vulgar words\\" under any circumstances, including previous instances where it gave leeway for \\"fleeting\\" expletives that networks unknowingly allowed to enter the airwaves. Fox was subsequently fined through its owned and operated television stations group, and challenged its fine in the courts. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled in the initial case (06-1760) that the FCC cannot punish broadcast stations for such incidents. The FCC appealed to the Supreme Court, and in the 2009 case, the Supreme Court reversed the Second Circuit,reversed the Second Circuit finding that the new policy was not arbitrary. However, the issue of constitutionality was remanded to the Second Circuit, which had not considered the issue initially. Background Upon remand to hear the initially deferred issue of constitutionality, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals re-heard the case in January 2010. On July 13, 2010, in a unanimous decision written by Judge Rosemary S. Pooler, the Second Circuit vacated the FCC order and policy on First Amendment grounds, finding that \\"by prohibiting all 'patently offensive' references to sex, sexual organs, and excretion without giving adequate guidance as to what 'patently offensive' means, the FCC effectively chills speech, because broadcasters have no way of knowing what the FCC will find offensive. To place any discussion of these vast topics at the broadcaster‚Äôs peril has the effect of promoting wide self-censorship of valuable material which should be completely protected under the First Amendment.\\" The Second Circuit added The FCC requested that the full Second Circuit hear the case en banc, but was denied. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in this round on January 10, 2012. Ruling In an 8‚Äì0 decision (Justice Sonia Sotomayor recused herself because she had previously sat on the Second Circuit) written by Justice Anthony Kennedy, the Supreme Court ruled that because the regulations at the time did not cover \\"fleeting expletives\\" (the regulations have since been amended to that end), the fines issued were invalidated as \\"unconstitutionally vague\\" under the Due Process Clause. Because the case was resolved on that basis, the Court declined to address the First Amendment implications of the FCC's indecency regulations or to reconsider FCC v. Pacifica, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).FCC v. Fox Television Stations, Inc., slip op. at 17. =Ginsburg concurrence= Ginsburg authored a one-paragraph concurrence in which she agreed with the decision, but argued that the Supreme Court should have revisited Pacifica, as she felt it was ‚Äúwrong when it was issued‚Äù.

She was the first woman to serve as associate editor of the LULAC newspaper and the first to write a charter to fund a LULAC youth group. Montemayor urged the inclusion of girls and women into Latin American activism and also promoted the interests of middle-class Mexican-Americans. and she is a designated honoree of Women's History Month of the National Women's History Project. and in the 20 January 2020 Extraordinary Accomplishments by Women profiles. Early life Dickerson was born in Laredo to John Randolph Dickerson and the former Manuela Barrera. She was of Irish and Hispanic heritage and was reared bilingual, a rarity in many La Raza homes at the time. In 1924, she graduated from the former Laredo High School, since Martin High School. After graduation, Montemayor attempted to study law, but after the death of her father, she remained in Laredo with her mother. For a year, she attended Laredo Business School in the evenings. On September 8, 1927, she married Francisco Montemayor; they had two sons, Francisco and Aurelio Montemayor. In 1934, Montemayor became a social worker for Webb County, where she investigated cases to place Mexican-Americans on welfare during the Great Depression. Upon starting this position, she was denied a key to the office and had to labor under a tree. Some of the Caucasian clients refused to work with her, and at one point she was provided a bodyguard for safety. In 1947, she enrolled in and attended classes for two years at the newly established Laredo Junior College. She cited the women who had influenced her as Marie Curie, Amelia Earhart, Carrie Nation, Frances Perkins, Eleanor Roosevelt, Helen Hayes, and Irene Dunne. League of United Latin American Citizens In 1936, Montemayor helped to charter the women's division of Laredo LULAC, a group of approximately thirty members, most of whom were married homemakers, secretaries, and other workers; most had a high school education. A highly active group, the council encouraged women to vote and to have aspirations to work outside the home. They supported abused children, raised funds for the Laredo orphanage and flood victims, bought school supplies for poor children, and sponsored a column in Laredo's newspaper and in the published edition of LULAC news. Delegates also traveled to conventions and sponsored the Junior LULAC league. They worked independently of the men's LULAC council, not serving as an auxiliary. In the local chapter, she would serve as the first secretary for most of 1936‚Äì1937 and president from 1938 to 1939. As secretary, she would report the chapter news to the LULAC News column \\"Around the Shield\\", which focused on local councils. In 1937 and 1938, she was one of two from the Laredo Ladies LULAC to attend regional conventions in Houston and El Paso. In Houston she was the only woman on a five-member finance committee, and in 1937 the majority male nominating committee named her to a national post. After April 1940, her name disappeared from LULAC News, ending her legacy with the organization. =Going national for LULAC= From 1937 until 1940, Montemayor held three national positions with LULAC: second national vice-president general, associate editor of LULAC News, and director general of Junior LULAC. The first national vice-president general was Fidencio Guerra of McAllen, Texas. After Montemayor held the position, and until it was abolished in 1970, women held the position, despite the roll never being gendered specifically for women. In this position, Montemayor promoted the establishment of more Ladies LULAC councils. As associate editor of LULAC News she advocated for women. She penned an anonymous editorial called \\"Son Muy Hombres(?)\\", triggered by two sexist incidents. The first of the two incidents involved a male member of LULAC writing a high official stating, upon Montemayor becoming vice president, \\"I hope that President Ramon Longoria will get well soon. There are those of us who hate to be under a woman.\\" The second incident took place under President Longoria as well. Three letters from the El Paso Ladies' LULAC seeking assistance were ignored, so the El Paso group left the league to avoid causing further drama.The El Paso Ladies' LULAC would later reorganize. In the editorial, Montemayor stated: \\"My honest opinion of those who think in that line, is that they are cowardly and unfair, ignorant and narrow minded.\\" She ended the editorial by asking any member of LULAC to write an article favoring the suppression of ladies councils or supporting the denial of giving them equal rights. =Supporting the Latino youth= In 1937, Mrs. Charles Ramirez of San Antonio's LULAC formed the idea for Junior LULAC and developed a resolution to create it. Ramirez co-organized the first group and in August 1938, Montemayor began a series of essays promoting the youth groups to senior councils. A local sponsor, she also continued to contribute to LULAC News, despite no longer serving as associate editor. She wrote the first charter for a youth chapter. In March 1937, she organized the second Junior council at her house; this chapter would go on to be the most active in LULAC. She recruited both boys and girls for the program, believing that starting young would help them \\"abandon the egotism and petty jealousies so common today among our ladies' and men's councils.\\" Her son, Francisco Montemayor, Jr., wrote in support of mixed groups, stating he disliked the idea of all-girl groups and rallied boys to prevent a majority of girls in the chapter. Montemayor believed that Junior LULAC provided leadership training necessary for youth to become good citizens and future LULAC senior members. The youth would learn debate and acting techniques, public service and expand on their educational skills like literacy. After LULAC In 1937, Montemayor opened a dress shop that failed. She operated another dress shop between 1951 and 1956. In 1956, she served as substitute registrar for the Laredo Independent School District and would also work at Christen Middle School until 1972. Montemayor was active in her local church, Our Lady of Guadalupe Catholic Church. There she served as organist, a catechism teacher, and organized the first youth choir. At Our Lady of Guadalupe she received a pontifical blessing. After retirement she worked as a folk artist. In 1973, she started raising gourds, which she then painted. By 1976, she was painting with acrylics on tin and masonite. The League of United Chicago Artists of Austin sponsored a solo exhibition of her work in August 1978 at Juarez‚ÄìLincoln University. She would go on to exhibit at Instituto Cultural Mexicano in November 1979, and in Chicago, Mission, Texas, and Riverside, California. The works, which she signed \\"Mom\\" or \\"Admonty,\\" often depicted women, nature, and Mexican family life. Bright colors, as often seen in Mexican folk art, were her palette of choice and she also produced still lifes, landscape and portraits. Montemayor was one of a number of Texan women of Mexican descent to win notice as a folk artist; others included Beatrice Valdez Xim√©nez and Consuelo Gonz√°lez AmezcuaAlice Dickerson Montemayor of Laredo ‚Äì Folk Art in Texas Sandra Jordan Folk art in Texas.

She died the next year and is interred at the Laredo Catholic Cemetery. Legacy Her papers and archives are in the collection of the University of Texas at Austin, held within the university library's Benson Latin American Collection. In 2015, Laredo LULAC named Montemayor winner of the \\"Conscience Builder\\" designation. Her son, Aurelio Montemayor, an educator in San Antonio, received the award on his mother's behalf. He referred to his mother as \\"a very independent woman ... a very strong social worker ... involved in leadership of youth groups.\\" In her painting, she was described as the \\"Chicano Grandma Moses\\".Yasmin Shariff, \\"Montemayor recognized as guardian of dignity\\", Laredo Morning Times, March 15, 2015, p. 3A =As a feminist= A prolific writer, Montemayor wrote more articles for LULAC than any other woman in its history. In her writing she stressed the importance of independent thinking for adults and youth. Her first essay was \\"We Need More Ladies Councils\\" where she called women to action to help reinvigorate inactive councils. She called her fellow female LULAC members \\"sisters\\", noting that at one annual convention there were seventy-one men's councils and fifteen women's councils, however, only twenty- six and four, respectively, attended. She believed that men engendered a competition between the councils based on allegations that the men were superior to women. However, Montemayor claimed women to be superior to men. She made public calls for women to join LULAC to empower themselves and help close the gender gap. She believed that women had common sense and were \\"able to see at a glance and penetrate into, in a second, what most men would not see with a searchlight or a telescope in an eternity.\\" She believed women possessed a \\"super logic\\" and were more active in seeking the truth than men. She believed that LULAC would never fully flourish until women helped men. She supported women taking a lead in LULAC but also stressed the importance of women as caretakers of children. Montemayor's involvement in LULAC was not without conflict. In 1937, conflict was noted in LULAC News, without little detail provided, about problems with the Laredo chapters. The Laredo LULAC men were described as not wanting the women's chapter to exist. Ezequiel D. Salinas, a state district court judge in Laredo and the president of LULAC from 1939 to 1940, reportedly hated Montemayor. According to Montemayor, Salinas and the local men's groups refused to vote for her at national conventions and questioned if their dislike was because of her as a person or because of her sex. Overall, Montemayor claimed that other men's groups and members were supportive of her work. She had strong business relationships with many well-traveled and college-educated men of LULAC.

In a racing career which lasted from 1906 to 1907 he ran seven times and won four races. In 1907 he became the first Irish-trained horse, and the third owned by an American, to win The Derby. In the same year, he became the first horse to complete the Epsom Derby-Irish Derby double, but his racing career was ended by training problems after one further race. He went on to become a successful breeding stallion. Background Orby, a rangy, well-made chestnut horse with a narrow white blaze was bred by his owner, the American politician Richard \\"Boss\\" Croker and raised at his Glencairn Stud. Although sometimes referred to as \\"Irish-bred\\", Orby was actually born in England and brought back with his mother to Ireland when still a foal. Croker was a controversial figure who based his racing and breeding operations in Ireland after being refused permission by the Jockey Club to set up in Newmarket. He was briefly in training with Henry ‚ÄúAtty‚Äù Persse, and then with Jim Parkinson at Maddenstown, County Kildare before being sent to Fred McCabe at his Glencairn Lodge Stables at Sandyford, near Dublin. Orby‚Äôs sire, Orme, was a successful racehorse whose victories included the Eclipse Stakes (twice), and the Champion Stakes. At stud he was the champion sire in 1899, the year in which his best son Flying Fox won the Triple Crown. Orby‚Äôs dam the American-bred Rhoda B., also produced the 1000 Guineas winner Rhodora. Racing career =1906: two-year-old season= Orby was a backward (immature) two-year-old with fragile hooves and his trainer at the time, Jim Parkinson only raced him at the insistence of the colt‚Äôs owner ‚ÄúBoss‚Äù Croker. The colt finished third at Leopardstown on hard ground, returning to the paddock with his feet bleeding, and third again in a race at the Curragh. =1907: three-year-old season= Spring Orby was trained at three by Fred McCabe. Early in the season he was mentioned as a potential Derby contender, being offered at odds of around 20/1 although he had not been entered in the 2000 Guineas. On his debut he was sent to England and won the Earl of Sefton Plate at Liverpool. He then returned to Ireland in May for the Baldoyle Plate over a mile and a half at Baldoyle Racecourse, north of Dublin. He started at odds of 8/18 against a \\"useful field\\" Orby was an easy and impressive winner and he became regarded as a serious Derby prospect. Croker backed the colt heavily and spent 2,500 guineas to buy a successful racehorse called Hayden to act as Orby's lead horse in training. When sending the colt to England, Croker arranged for him to be accompanied by a bodyguard consisting of seventeen \\"stout Irishmen\\" to ensure his security. Summer On a \\"cold, wet, windy and miserable\\" day at Epsom, Orby started at odds of 100/9 (approximately 11/1) in a field of nine, with the 2000 Guineas winner Slieve Gallion starting the 8/13 favourite on rain- softened ground. The crowd was reported to be unusually sober and formal; the spectators for this \\"silk-hatted Derby\\" including the King and the Prince of Wales. Ridden by the American John Reiff- Danny Maher had reportedly turned down the ride- Orby was settled in fifth or sixth place in the early stages as first John Bull and then Slieve Gallion led the field. Reiff moved Orby into the third place just after half way and took the lead when Slieve Gallion ran wide entering the straight. Orby opened up a clear lead and stayed on to win \\"cleverly\\" by two lengths from Wool Winder with Slieve Gallion finishing third. Although many were of the view that Sleive Gallion had failed to stay, his trainer, Sam Darling offered no excuses and said that he had been \\"beaten by a better horse.\\" Wool Winder made up a great deal of ground in the straight and was felt by some to have been an unlucky loser. Croker, who reportedly landed bets of ¬£40,000 on the race gave his winning prize money to charity. Shortly after Orby's win, Croker challenged the owner of Slieve Gallion to a match race between the colts for \\"a substantial sum\\" over any distance. The challenge was not accepted. Orby bypassed a possible run at Royal Ascot and instead became the first Epsom Derby winner to also win the Irish Derby at the Curragh, justifying his position as 1/10 favourite. Autumn Before his next race, stories began to circulate that Orby was a \\"whistler\\", suggesting that he was developing respiratory problems (\\"touched in the wind\\"). Orby was back in England before the end of July and started 4/7 favourite for the Atlantic Stakes at Liverpool. He finished last of the four runners behind Linacre, a colt who had finished third to Slieve Gallion in the 2000 Guineas and to whom Orby was conceding eighteen pounds. A veterinary examination was undertaken, and his owner was advised that the colt needed to be rested. Croker however, insisted on having Orby prepared for the St Leger, a race in which he was scheduled to have a much-anticipated rematch with Wool Winder. Shortly before the St Leger, Orby broke down badly in training, sustaining injuries which forced his withdrawal. One contemporary report suggests that the colt was also suffering from \\"kidney trouble.\\" At the end of the season it was said to be \\"improbable\\" that Orby would return to racing and although there were hopes of a return in the early part of 1908, he was retired to stud. Assessment In their book A Century of Champions, John Randall and Tony Morris rated Orby on 133, making him an ‚Äúaverage‚Äù Derby winner but the best Irish-trained horse of the first half of the 20th Century. Despite Orby's lack of success at two, Jim Parkinson, who trained him in 1906 was reported to have regarded him as \\"by far and away the best he had ever tried or ever known.\\" Orby earned ¬£6,717 in win prize money in 1907, placing him seventh in the British list of highest earners behind Lally, Wool Winder, Sancy, Lesbia, Slieve Gallion and White Eagle. Stud career Orby stood as a stallion at his owner's Glencairn Stud. He proved to be reasonably successful, siring the Classic winners Grand Parade (Derby) and Diadem (1000 Guineas) and being regarded as a good source of speed. He sired the winners of at least seventy races and ¬£30,000 in prize money. Orby died at Sandyford on 6 April 1918. Pedigree Note: b. = Bay, br. = Brown, ch. = Chestnut * Orby was inbred 4 √ó 4 to 1873 Epsom Derby winner Doncaster. This means that the stallion appears twice in the fourth generation of his pedigree.

In 1991 the company was prospecting for gold in west-central British Columbia. With rising gold prices, in 1995 Alpine Exploration said it was planning to spend $250,000 on exploration of its three properties in northern British Columbia and in Alaska. Alpine Exploration changed its name to Shiega Resources Corporation in November 1997. In 1998 Shiega was in a joint venture with SAMAX Gold Inc. on the Nkroful gold mining project in Ghana. Shiega also had an interest in a project in the Tintina Gold Belt, northeast of Fairbanks, Alaska. That year Shiega was engaged in negotiations for a merger with Aurex AB, a gold miner, but the deal was dropped in January 1999.

This subspecialty is known as Chronotherapeutics.  Education and career  Terman received an AB from Columbia College in 1964, and a ScM (1966) and PhD (1968) from Brown University in the field of physiological psychology. From 1969 to 1981, he served on the psychology faculties of Brown and Northeastern Universities. He then moved to Columbia, where he is a Professor of Clinical Psychology in Psychiatry, with a joint appointment as a Research Scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute. He established the Clinical Chronobiology research program there in 1983 with funding from the National Institute of Mental Health. In 2004, the program evolved into the first hospital-based chronotherapeutics outpatient clinic in the United States, the Center for Light Treatment and Biological Rhythms at Columbia University Medical Center. In 1994, in parallel with his academic pursuits, he founded the Center for Environmental Therapeutics (CET), an independent, nonprofit international consortium of specialists in circadian biology, psychiatry and ophthalmology that provides chronotherapeutics education to both the lay public and clinicians. He serves as President of CET.  Research  Before turning to clinical research, Terman‚Äôs laboratory work focused on the effects of light- dark exposure and timing of food ingestion on circadian rhythm organization in animals. The hypothalamic internal ‚Äúmaster‚Äù clock in the suprachiasmatic nuclei had recently been discovered, with a primary function of programming daily cycles of physiology and behavior even in the absence of day-night cues. In animals lacking the clock nuclei, they showed that circadian rhythms of visual sensitivity and anticipatory behavior for scheduled meals persisted, even though unrestricted feeding and drinking behavior became arrhythmic. This work contributed to the conception of ‚Äúperipheral‚Äù internal clocks (e.g., in the retina and liver) that operate in a coordinated multiple-clock system. With Swiss colleagues Charlotte Rem√© and Anna Wirz-Justice, he published the 1991 empirical and theoretical synthesis, The Visual Input Stage of the Circadian Timing System.http://www.cet.org/about/ After the discovery in the early 1980s of light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, at the National Institute of Mental Health, Terman turned to clinical therapeutics, with a focus on non-pharmacologic antidepressant responses to circadian light schedules. The lab developed ‚Äú10,000 lux bright light therapy,‚Äù which became the standard regimen for brief morning light treatment to reset the internal clock at an earlier position in the 24-hour day. The method has been extended to treatment of nonseasonal depression, bipolar depression and depression during pregnancy. It has also been used to correct the insomnia associated with delayed sleep phase disorder. Terman's animal studies showed that the internal circadian clock responds with high sensitivity to the small light level changes during gradual dawn and dusk transitions, independent of daytime lighting. In an extension to chronotherapeutics, his group designed a computerized twilight simulator for use in the bedroom. The dim incremental dawn signal, received through closed eyelids, exerts an antidepressant effect similar to post-awakening bright light therapy,http://www.chronotherapeutics.org/docs/term/Terman%202006%20AJP.pdf and acts like bright light by resetting the circadian clock to an earlier hour. Serendipitously, the lab discovered that a nonvisual environmental factor, negative air ion concentration, also has an antidepressant effect. Negative ions (in nature or from electronic air purifiers) had long been presumed to have a nonspecific positive effect on wellbeing, and might be exploited as a placebo control for light therapy. The lab tested low ion levels vs. high ion levels in a set of randomized, controlled, double-blind clinical trials. The high concentrations showed significantly greater antidepressant effect for both seasonal and nonseasonal depression, as well as when administered after waking or during sleep.http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.1995.1.87 The lab also devised a formulation that mimics pineal melatonin production without spikes and with gradual washout corresponding to the natural nighttime pattern. When used several hours before sleep, it magnifies the clock resetting effect of light at wake-up, which is particularly useful for normalizing the sleep pattern in patients with delayed sleep phase disorder.  Applied Chronotherapeutics  In 2009, Terman, with colleagues Anna Wirz-Justice (Basel) and Francesco Benedetti (Milan) published the first chronotherapeutics treatment manualTerman, M (2010) Sleeping (or not) by the wrong clock. The New York Times, April 20. for clinicians. With particular emphasis on bipolar depression, it explains how three non-pharmaceutical procedures can be combined to produce rapid remission from depression within a week or less. Patients receive up to three alternate nights of wake therapy (no sleep allowed) with light therapy each morning. Recovery sleep on alternate nights begins earlier than usual, but shifts over days to normal bedtime. The method has been applied successfully at San Raffaele Hospital in Milan, Frederiksborg General Hospital, Hilleroed, Denmark, and the University of California at Irvine. The first U.S. clinic opened in Chicago, in collaboration with the Center for Environmental Therapeutics, in the fall of 2010. Terman also devised a questionnaire that estimates the melatonin cycle so light therapy could be timed effectively without serial sampling of melatonin in the blood or saliva.

Saint Ballado was the leading sire in North America of 2005. Background Saint Ballado was bred in Ontario by Windfields Farm. He was sired by Halo, himself a leading sire whose other offspring included the great Sunday Silence. Saint Ballado's dam, Ballade, was the 1992 Canadian Broodmare of the Year. A daughter of Herbager, she had previously produced champions Glorious Song and Devil's Bag. In 1990, Saint Ballado was purchased at a Keeneland yearling sale for $90,000 by Clint Goodrich as agent for Tartan Farms. The price was thought to be low for the full brother to the champions Glorious Song and Devil's Bag, but bidders were put off by his conformation (he was notably back at the knees and had upright pasterns). In 1991, Saint Ballado was purchased privately from Tartan Farms by trainer Clint Goodrich and his two partners, Robert Lothenbach and Stephan Herold, for $150,000. Race career Saint Ballado's race record spanned only nine starts with four wins to his credit, two of them at the stakes level. In August 1991, he started in his first race, finishing second in a maiden race at Arlington Park. However, he was given time off due to his lingering physical immaturity and did not break his maiden until January 1992 in what was his second lifetime start. By his fourth race, he had his second win. He was then moved into stakes races and was unplaced in two Grade II events, the Jim Beam and Blue Grass Stakes. Goodrich moved him back to Arlington Park and entered him in the Grade III Sheridan Stakes, which he won by seven lengths. Saint Ballado was then entered in the Arlington Classic, then a Grade II stakes. He won the race by 4 and a half lengths pulling away. In his next start though, he finished fourth in the Grade I Haskell Invitational at Monmouth Park. Saint Ballado retired after the Haskell, his career possibly cut short by his conformation faults.Thoroughbred Times Retrieved: March 18, 2012 Breeding career In 1993, Saint Ballado began his breeding career in Florida at Ocala Stud Farms. Because of his indifferent race record and the lack of success of Devil's Bag at stud, his initial stud fee was only $2,500. At the time of his death in 2002, his stud fee had jumped to $125,000, over 50 times his original fee. By that time, he had been purchased from the original racing partnership of Goodrich, Lothenbach and Herold by breeder Aaron U. Jones for a reported (USD) $6.5M and relocated to Taylor Made Farm in Kentucky. In 2005, Saint Ballado was awarded Leading Sire of the Year with his progeny earning over $9.2 million that year alone. His offspring also did very well in yearlings sales. For example, Word of Mouth sold for $2.6 million, and Warhol sold for $4 million.BALLADO'S LEGACY Retrieved: March 18, 2012 Saint Ballado sired 68 stakes winners from 717 named foals. His most notable offspring include: * Saint Liam: Champion Older Male 2005 and Horse of the Year 2005 * Ashado: Champion 3-Y-O Filly 2004; Champion Older Female 2005 * Captain Bodgit: Grade 1 Winner (Florida Derby) * Yankee Victor: Grade 1 Winner (Metropolitan Handicap) * Sunriver: Grade 1 Winner (Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes) * Sister Act: Grade 1 Winner (Hempstead Handicap) Death Saint Ballado was euthanized in October 2002 after \\"surgery to correct clinical signs associated with a compressive cervical myelopathy.\\" He died as a relatively young stallion at the age of 13 and was buried at Taylor Made Farm, where he spent his last years standing at stud.Saint Ballado Euthanized: Bloodhorse.com Retrieved on 2011-12-11 Pedigree References Category:1989 racehorse births Category:2002 racehorse deaths Category:Racehorses bred in Canada Category:Racehorses trained in the United States Category:Thoroughbred family 12-c Category:United States Champion Thoroughbred Sires ","title":"Saint Ballado"},{"id":"33725199","title":"1960 Grand National"},{"id":"33725205","text":"Kaniv Raion is a raion (district) of Cherkasy Oblast, central Ukraine.

Numbers like \\"Spinning Wheel,\\" \\"Lucretia MacEvil,\\" \\"And When I Die,\\" and \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\" are done in such loose-limbed fashion that, apart from showcasing some virtuoso playing and Clayton-Thomas' more oppressive mannerisms, they're rather weak reinterpretations...

One Israeli officer and 5 soldiers were killed in an attack on an IDF checkpoint near the Palestinian village of Ein 'Arik, west of Ramallah in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. History The checkpoint was manned by eight soldiers, five of whom were on duty while three were resting in a nearby trailer. The two militants set out from Ramallah. They approached the checkpoint at 9 pm. Shortly after a change of guards they open fire on the soldiers at the checkpoint, killing three of them and moderately wounding a fourth. A fifth soldier, who served as the look-out, fled the scene unharmed and alerted military authorities. The militants then proceeded to a nearby trailer where the remaining soldiers were holed up. The commanding officer Lt. Moshe Eini and two other soldiers were killed. It is uncertain whether the Israeli soldiers ever returned fire. None of the militants were hurt in the clash and both returned to Ramallah. The two militants were policemen of the Palestinian National Authority and reportedly members of the Fatah movement.

One of the participants of the attack, variously named \\"Said Saliman Saida\\" or \\"Shadi Sawaa'da\\" (Palestinian sources identify him as Shadi Sa'id as-Su‚Äôayida ) was later arrested and sentenced to 7 life sentences.

The center is housed in a 19th-century complex of industrial buildings and contains the studio space of over 300 artists. Goat Farm hosts music concerts, traditional and experimental theatrical performances, film screenings, contemporary dance performances, art exhibitions, artist residency programs, and professional ballet and contemporary dance classes. It is also home to resident performance companies gloATL, Saiah Theater, and The Collective Project. History It was built during the 1880s, opened in 1889, and expanded in various phases through the early 1930s. It was Edward Van Winkle's third complex in Atlanta - a previous one was located in today's Luckie Marietta district. By 1898, the site specialized in cotton-related machinery, and won awards at international expositions and state fairs. In 1912, the Murray Company of Texas bought out Van Winkle and the site became known as \\"Murray's Mill.\\" During World War II, the complex produced ammunition and mortars. In the early 1970s Robert Haywood bought the site and sculptors, musicians, painters and photographers set up studios there. For a time in the early 2000s space was rented to antique dealers as \\"The Shops at Murray Mill\\", but the antique mall never took off. The site remained unused for many years. A Goat Farm performance On July 15, 2010, the property was sold for a reported $7 million to Hallister Development, specialists in renovating historic properties. Hallister stated that it planned to preserve and boost the property as an arts-friendly community.Thomas Wheatley, \\"Goat Farm gets sold: Atlanta cotton gin-turned- artists‚Äô space finds new owner\\", Creative Loafing, July 29, 2010 In 2008, as an alternate back up plan, Hallister Development filed a \\"Developments of Regional Impact\\" application with the Georgia Regional Transportation Authority for a project containing 426 residential units at the location, to contain of office and of retail. Hallister Development ultimately chose not to pursue redevelopment of the site into a residential/commercial complex. In 2009, Hallister made the decision to develop the site into a Center for the Visual and Performing Arts containing performance and exhibition halls, a cafe/library, an on-site organic farm, an education center, a 5000 square foot space dedicated to contemporary dance, and creative studios for artists. In 2010, it was used for filming in the episode \\"Vatos\\" of The Walking Dead. In 2012, it was used for The Hunger Games: Catching Fire filming.  Organization  The Goat Farm primarily explores experimental and innovative works. The Arts Center is a for-profit arts model and does not operate on public funding, donations or grants. Its non-traditional rustic auditoriums are Goodson Yard, The Rodriguez Room, The Warhorse and three exterior venues - The Village Green, Warhorse Court and The Dovetail. Ballet and contemporary dance classes are offered through resident dance troupe gloATL. Its education and career development platform, Stimulus Diffusion, connects creatives to a wide variety of educational initiatives in Atlanta. The Goat Farm Arts Center provides its performance and exhibition halls to artists through a curatorial process in which those who wish to use the space submit a proposal. Once an idea is selected, the Goat Farm invests in and works with the artists and/or performance groups to actualize the concept.

He fought in the Parliamentarian army in the English Civil War. Biography Bridges was the eldest son of John Bridges of Alcester, Warwickshire and Hackney, barrister at law, and his wife Elizabeth Holyoake. His great grandfather John Bridges was of an Irish family and settled at South Littleton, Worcestershire in 1558, and later acquired the Alcester estate.W R Williams The Parliamentary History of the County of Worcester Bridges was an active soldier in the Parliamentary army in the Civil War. In April 1644, he conveyed ammunition into Gloucester while it was under siege from the Royalists. On 11 May 1644 the House of Commons ordered John Bridges, major of foot, to be added to the Committee of Worcestershire on 30 March 1645. They gave him a vote of thanks \\"for his great services,\\" and appointed him Governor of Warwick Castle and Town on 12 May 1645. He was made Colonel of Boseville's regiment of foot on 24 June 1645. He took part in the siege of Worcester under Colonel Edward Whalley, and was a parliamentary commissioner to receive its surrender in July 1646. He was ordered to return his forces into winter quarters on 25 November 1646, and was \\"continued\\" as Governor of Warwick Castle on 25 March 1647, and still held the role in 1649. In about 1648 he bought the estate of Hurcott near Kidderminster, from John Evelyn for ¬£3,400. Information was laid against him on 22 August 1649 that he had captured and concealed 25 waggons, many laden with plate and other treasure, belonging to the late King. He was added to the Committee for dealing with Scandalous and Malignant Ministers in Worcestershire on 24 September 1652. In 1654, Bridges was elected Member of Parliament for Worcestershire in the First Protectorate Parliament. He was in service in Ireland in 1655 and represented Sligo and Roscommon in the Second Protectorate Parliament in 1656. He raised a petition on 7 April 1657 when he was Governor of Kilmalloch, for payment for arrears for personal service, which was referred to the Irish Committee, On 21 March 1660 a warrant was issued to pay him ¬£100 \\"for his expenses in Ireland where he is going on special service\\". The allegations that he had carried off 25 waggons of the King's goods returned following the Restoration. In June 1660 Sir Joseph Wagstaffe petitioned the King \\"that Colonel John Bridges late Governor of Warwick Castle, who detains ¬£50,000 worth of the late King's money and goods, may be excepted out of the Act of Oblivion\\" and in the same month Charles Talbot laid information against him and others\\" for seizing the late King's carriages about the time of the Battles of Naseby and Edgehill.\\" On 17 August 1663 Lord Ashley reported that Bridges was \\"acquitted on a suit brought against him for detaining plate and household goods of the late King\\". John Strode (Governor of Dover Castle) who had a warrant of 21 August 1663 for a grant of a \\"moiety of what is taken and unaccounted for, and not pardoned by the Act of Indemnity\\" persisted in the belief that Bridges should be convicted although Lord Ashley pointed out that Strode \\"may be encouraged by the grant\\". Family Bridges married Mary Beale daughter of Bartholomew Beale, of Walton, Shropshire in 1635. His grandson Sir Brook Bridges, 1st Baronet was created a baronet.

SH 1 left State Highway 1 ran from El Paso through Dallas to Texarkana. It was the first highway designated in 1917. In 1926, the United States Highway System was designated, with US 80 colocated from El Paso to Dallas and US 67 from Dallas to Texarkana. On September 26, 1939, the dual designations were removed, leaving SH 1 only on a small stretch west of Dallas. This section was redesignated as State Loop 260 on August 20, 1952. Since that time, the number \\"may only be assigned by the Executive Director of the Texas Department of Transportation or the Transportation Commission.\\" SH 2 leftState Highway 2 was originally designated in 1917, running from Wichita Falls southeast to Fort Worth. The route then split in two at Waco, with one branch travelling southwest through Austin and San Antonio before ending at Laredo, while the eastern branch traveled southeast through Houston, ending at Galveston. The eastern branch was transferred to SH 6 on August 21, 1923 to avoid having two separate highways with the same number. The western route was assigned the US 81 routing in 1926. The co-designation with US 81 was dropped completely on September 26, 1939. SH 13 leftState Highway 13 was originally designated in 1917, running through the Texas Panhandle along the Ozark Trail. It generally referenced the routing due west from Amarillo to the New Mexico state line. In 1926, US Route 66 was co-located along the route. The co- designation was dropped completely on September 26, 1939. SH 28 left State Highway 28 was designated on September 3, 1917, on a route that ran across the southern Texas Panhandle from Farwell to Mineral Wells. On January 20, 1919, a branch, SH 28A, was designated from Crowell through Vernon to the Oklahoma border. By August 21, 1922, a branch to Sagerton was added. On August 21, 1923, the section from Crowell to Sagerton was renumbered as SH 51 and the branch to Jacksboro was renumbered as SH 24, with the section of the branch from Jacksboro to Mineral Wells already part of SH 25. SH 28 was instead rerouted over SH 28A through Vernon to the Oklahoma border. US 70 was co- located along the entire route, except for the small branch northeast of Vernon. This branch was assigned to US 183 in 1939. left On August 4, 1932, SH 28 Loop was designated through Lockney. On August 1, 1936, a SH 28 Spur was added on top of the SH 28 Loop. On November 16, 1937, another SH 28 Spur was designated in Olton. All co-designations with US Routes were removed completely on September 26, 1939. SH 28 Spur and SH 28 Loop became Spur 9 (Olton) and Loop 75 (Lockney). SH 38 left State Highway 38 has been designated three times. The first route was to be designated on May 20, 1918, from Greenville north and east through Honey Grove to the Oklahoma border, but that was deferred. The route was finally designated on June 17, 1918, from Greenville to SH 5 at an unknown point north of Wolfe City. On August 20, 1918, the route was extended to the Red River and was decided to cross SH 5 at Honey Grove. On February 19, 1919, the route extended south to Terrell. On April 20, 1919, the route extended southwest to Ennis. On August 17, 1923, the sections south of Kaufman and north of Greenville were cancelled. On December 17, 1923, this route was cancelled, as it became the northern extension of SH 34. The route was re-designated as a spur from SH 43 to Beckville. On October 20, 1924, this route became part of rerouted SH 8. left The route was re- designated on January 22, 1930, on a route from Sugar Land southeast to Alvin. On June 25, 1930, it extended southeast to Galveston over part of SH 58. SH 38 Spur was designated on April 25, 1933 to Sugarland. On September 26, 1939, this routing became the southern extension of SH 6 when it was rerouted around the western side of Houston. SH 38 Spur was renumbered Spur 58. SH 38A was designated on February 27, 1919, from Ladonia to Paris. On August 21, 1923, this route was cancelled. SH 52 left State Highway 52 was designated on August 21, 1923, from Hedley through Wellington to the Oklahoma border as a renumbering of a section of TX 13. The March 19, 1930 log only showed the section from Wellington to Oklahoma, but erroneously omitted the section from Wellington to Hedley. On November 30, 1932, the section of SH 52 from Wellington to Hedley was put back on the state highway log. The section west of Wellington was renumbered again as TX 203 on March 13, 1934, and this numbering replaced the rest of SH 52 on September 26, 1945. SH 58 left State Highway 58 is a highway that has been designated twice. It was first designated on August 21, 1923, on a route from Edna to east of Galveston via Bay City, Columbia, and Angleton.

On March 19, 1928, the western portion of the route was rerouted to the Army Camp near Palacios from Bay City. The eastern portion was rerouted through Alvin between Angleton and Galveston. on February 20, 1929, the section from Ganado to Midfield was restored as a state highway, with no number, and this was eliminated on March 19, 1930. On June 25, 1930, the route was truncated to end at Alvin as the route from Alvin to Galveston was transferred to SH 38. By 1935, the route designation was canceled, and the highway was added to SH 35 as an extension. left The second designation was in 2009 on a connecting route in Midland. The route in Midland was designated on May 28, 2009. Construction of the new roadway between Cotton Flat Rd. and Carter Ave. began in May 2010. It was completed by June 30, 2011, but it was cancelled that day. This route became Business State Highway 158-B in 2011 when it was rerouted. SH 69 left State Highway 69 is a route that has been designated twice. It was first designated on August 21, 1923, from Cameron to Hearne as a renumbering of SH 36A. By 1933, it received a co-designation with US Route 190. The state designation was removed on September 26, 1939. The second designation was on August 4, 1971, near Eastland as a renumbering of a section of TX 6 when it was rerouted further west. On August 28, 1991, SH 69 extended east to I-20, replacing part of US 80 which was decommissioned west of Dallas.

In 1935, US 190 was co-located with the highway from Brady to Lampasas. On July 15, 1935, the section from SH 195 to Liberty Hill was cancelled. This section was restored on April 28, 1937 (and is on the March 1, 1936 map). The co-designation was removed on September 26, 1939, leaving the section from Lampasas to Liberty Hill. This section was replaced by US 183 on May 23, 1951, when its route was adjusted through Texas. The second designation was on June 27, 1995, as a route across the southern portion of Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. This route, also known as the East-West Connector, has not been constructed, but remains designated. A public meeting took place on July 30, 2015. SH 74A was designated from Lometa to Goldthwaite. On February 21, 1938, SH 74A Business was designated in Goldthwaite. On September 26, 1939, the route was renumbered TX 284 (now US 183), and SH 74A Business was renumbered as Loop 15. SH 76 left State Highway 76 is a route that has been designated twice. It was first designated on August 21, 1923, from Nacogdoches northeast to the Louisiana border as a renumbering of a portion of TX 22.

SH 84 left State Highway 84 was designated on August 21, 1923, as a route across West Texas from the New Mexico border through Brownfield and Post to Jayton, replacing portions of SH 18 and SH 39. On December 1, 1930, the section from Clairemont to Jayton was transferred to TX 70 when it was rerouted. In 1932, the route was co-located with US 380. In 1939, the co-designation with US 380 was completely removed. SH 84A was a spur designated on May 25, 1925, from SH 84 in Clairemont to Rotan.

On March 28, 1927, this was renumbered to SH 103, as old SH 103 was conditional. left Instead, SH 101, a connector route from Georgetown east to SH 95 at Circleville, was renumbered to SH 104 to avoid duplication with another SH 101. On May 28, 1932, the route was extended west to reach Liberty Hill, and was completed by 1936. The route was transferred to SH 29 on August 22, 1951, when it was extended after being supplanted by US 183 on May 23, 1951. SH 106 left State Highway 106 was designated on May 4, 1925, as a route from Crockett to Corrigan in East Texas. On September 7, 1927, the route was extended southeast to reach Woodville, and was completed by 1936. When the renumbering was planned out, SH 106 was not going to be cancelled, as US 287 did not yet exist. On September 26, 1939, the route was assigned to the newly created US 287, with the Texas Highway designation removed. SH 109 40px State Highway 109 is a highway that has been designated twice.

The Library is at 3939 Central Ave, Columbia Heights, Anoka County, Minnesota, United States. Columbia Heights is a first ring suburb of Minneapolis and serves the greater communities of Anoka, Hennepin and Ramsey Counties. The Columbia Heights Public Library is a city-owned library funded by a city library levy. It is one of five city owned and operated libraries in the Metropolitan Library Service Agency (MELSA) including Bayport, South St. Paul, St. Paul, and Stillwater.MELSA Library locations CHPL 2011 History The Columbia Heights Public Library opened its doors for the first time on December 3, 1928, at 3949 Central Ave N.E., on the main level of the Heights Theater, and later moved to the second floor. CHPL 1928 The previous month the Silver Lake School Mothers' Club, with President Harriet Blythe, decided the City of Columbia Heights needed a public library since it was opening its first public high school. Members of the club canvassed the neighborhoods on foot with children's wagons to solicit donations of books, magazines, and furniture. On November 17, 1928, Margaret Thomas, a high school teacher, agreed to head the first Library Board. In 1938, the library moved to the second floor of a building at 4002 Central Ave. The library moved to 828 40th Ave, and became the \\"War Information Center\\" in 1941. CHPL 1941 The library, located in a rented building at 838 40th Ave N.E., was recognized by the City Council as a department of the city in 1952, when it celebrated its 25th anniversary. CHPL 1953 The Library moved in 1960 to 820 40th Ave NE, and the first professional librarian was hired. In 1966, the Library obtained an LSCA (Library Services and Construction Act) grant and a Civil Defense grant to fund an addition to the original building. The building housed the library on the first floor and the City Civil Defense program in the lower level. In 1971, the Library negotiated to join the newly created MELSA through a contract with the Anoka County Library. The contract provided reciprocal borrowing and returns, and inter-library loans. In 1971, the Civil Defense area of the building was taken over by the library and remodeled to house the Children's Department and activity room. In 1979, The Friends of the Library were reorganized after a hiatus of several years, with Helen Merrick as the president. The Columbia Heights Friends are individuals and families who support services and programs at the library. The Friends provide financial support for materials and services, and host special library events. Over the next several years the library made technological advances with a materials security system installed in 1984, automation of the circulation system in 1987, an online public catalog in 1992, public Internet access provided in 1997 (graphics available in 2000), and a web-based catalog activated in 1998. In 1994, the building was brought up to full ADA compliance by installing an elevator, handicapped accessible restroom, ADA compliant signage and furniture. The ADA compliance project utilized CDBG (Community Development Block Grant) funds. The membrane roofing was replaced with a built-up tar and shingle product, and all computer wiring was upgraded to category 5 cable in 1999. In 2001, the public access terminals were replaced with PCs and the circulation terminals were replaced in 2002. In 2009, the Library received a Gates Online Opportunity Hardware grant from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation https://web.archive.org/web/20121012112446/http://www.gatesfoundation.org/Pages/home.aspx for public use computers. Also in 2009, the Library received a \\"Picturing America\\" grant from the National Endowment for the Arts which included photographic reproductions of famous American works of art, an After School Community Learning Grant for programing, a 21st Century grant for programing, and a Dollar General literacy Foundation grant for materials. In 2016, the library moved into a newly-constructed building at 3939 Central Avenue Northeast. The building was designed by HGA Architects and built by Ebert Construction.

His work as Assistant Director of Armament Research and Development with responsibility for armament led to the establishment of the \\"Air Fighting Committee\\" in 1934. His career ended prematurely after championing the rights of RAF personnel posted in Canada. Early life Claude H. Keith was born in Qu'Appelle, Saskatchewan, Canada in 1890 to English parents Hilton Keith and Ellen Mary Katharine Rogers. He was baptised in Cornwall in 1891 and was living with his grandparents in 1901 in London.1901 England Census His father was an Indian Agent in the Touchwood Hills. He trained as an electrical engineer with Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company, and was present at Dover in 1909 as Bleriot landed after completing the first air crossing of the English Channel. In 1910 he travelled to Fiji to establish three new radio stations.The New York Times, 12 December 1910 In 1912 he made his first flight with Hubert Spencer in a dual control box kite. Military career Keith joined the Royal Naval Air Service in 1915 and qualified on seaplanes in 1916. As a probationary flight officer he was charged with \\"endangering one of His Majesty's aircraft\\" by looping the loop and a year later was teaching this as part of basic training. He became a Seaplane Group Navigational Officer, and after the RNAS was amalgamated with the Royal Flying Corps in 1918, was commissioned in the RAF and became a specialist in navigation and armament at the School of Naval Co-operation and Aerial Navigation where he drafted the syllabus for the RAF's first Long Range Navigation course before taking it himself. He was subsequently attached to No. 230 Squadron in 1922 as a flight lieutenant. =Interwar years= Keith was appointed chief instructor of the first Royal Air Force armament school at Eastchurch in 1925. In 1926 he was assigned to No. 70 Squadron in Iraq flying Vickers Vernon and Vickers Victoria bomber/transport aircraft. Since 1919 the RAF had been engaged in first large scale attempt at colonial control through air power. Lord Trenchard promised that the RAF could control Iraq with air squadrons and a few armoured car squadrons, supported by locally recruited troops led by a few British troops, at a fraction of the cost of a large army garrison. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, the RAF was used to quell minor rebellions and tribal banditry by swiftly punishing the culprits from the air. In 1927 he was part of an RAF team on the Trans Oman Expedition aimed at securing air routes which were viewed as vital in securing communication and control over British Empire territories. As squadron leader Keith commanded No. 6 (Army Co-operation) Squadron equipped with Bristol F.2 Fighter's between 1928‚Äì30 operating in Northern Iraq. During this time his emphasis on gunnery skills led to the first ever 100% of bullets on target being achieved by Flying Officer C.H. Evans, with 11 of 12 pilots in his squadron becoming 'Hundred-Percenters' and receiving a letter of congratulations from Lord Trenchard, the Chief of the Air Staff. The squadron was briefly assigned to Egypt to quell riots between the Arab and Jewish communities in Palestine. Aircraft armament From 1930 to 1933 Keith was in charge of the design of all bombs at the Woolwich Arsenal. In September 1933 Wing Commander C. H. Keith joined the Air Ministry as an Assistant Director of Armament Research and Development with responsibility for armament. His role in the arming of the RAF over the next three years led to key decisions that were critical for the success of the RAF in the battle of Britain. In July 1934 after meetings with Air Commodore Arthur Tedder he organised an informal conference to consider air gunnery which led to the formation of the 'Air Fighting Committee' on which Keith served till 1936. Keith and his team presented their work showing that future aircraft should carry eight machine guns capable of firing at least 1,000 rounds per minute. Both the number of guns and the rate of fire was seen as revolutionary at a time when many officers thought four guns were adequate and Air Marshal Brooke-Popham is famously quoted as saying \\"I think eight guns is going a bit far With the support of Air Marshall Arthur Tedder the decision was made. Further input from Keith and his team led to the decision to replace the English Vickers machine gun with the more reliable American Browning machine guns and to adapt these to RAF use. The Browning became the main armament for Supermarine Spitfires and Hawker Hurricanes in the Battle of Britain. Having used slow motion film to record the penetration of bombs it was Keith who arranged the first such evaluation of machine guns. He was also actively engaged in the development and trials of suitable ammunition. These guns used the same bullets as a rifle and the need for a more powerful weapon had long been recognised. Keith played a key role in the decision to introduce the French designed Hispano 20 mm cannon after a visit to France in 1936. The Hispano cannon was then made under license in Britain and was first used in 1940. Early trials in Hurricanes and Spitfires found that the gun could jam during combat but after modifications it became standard armament in later fighters. The Hispano proved to be a good 'tank buster' and allowed Spitfires and Hurricanes to make effective attacks on ground targets and enemy shipping becoming one of the most used aircraft guns of the 20th Century. Keith also played a part in the introduction of the Frazer-Nash power-driven gun turret securing the first order of 64 turrets for the RAF. This invention was of immense value as the Second World War approached and fitted with up to four .303 Browning machine guns was standard equipment in British bombers. He developed the training strategy of attaching a light to the guns and instructing the trainee gunner to follow an independent light shone against a wall. Keith commanded RAF Worthy Down from September 1936. In 1937 he was promoted to Group Captain and published The Flying Years about his early career and his experiences in Iraq. He was subsequently appointed as the RAF member to the Ordnance Board at Woolwich. =Second World War= In 1939 Keith was Commander of RAF Marham heavy bomber station and aircraft under his command were some of the first to launch raids against Germany. In 1940 he found \\"An Airman's Letter to His Mother\\" written by the young pilot of a Vickers Wellington bomber supporting the evacuation of the BEF at Dunkirk to be sent to his mother in the event of his death. Group Captain Keith was so moved by the letter that, with the mother's permission, it was anonymously published in The Times on 18 June 1940.The Times, 18 June 2004 Published as a small book,An Airmans Letter to His Mother, Times Publishing Ltd., 1940 it went on to sell over 500,000 copies in the first year and was then made into a short propaganda film. Keith served a short period as President of the Aircrew Selection Board before he was appointed the first Commanding Officers of Picton Gunnery School, Canada, in April 1941. This was part of the Commonwealth Air Training Plan providing Canadian and RAF personnel with training bases away from the dangers and restrictions of training in wartime Britain. Unlike the members of the RAF, Royal Canadian Air Force personnel paid the lower Canadian rate of tax and none at all if they flew more than average time each year. This with other \\" hardships\\", produced \\"bitterness\\" and \\"dissatisfaction\\" among the RAF personnel serving in Canada. Keith presented a list of \\"20 points of hardships\\" which he felt \\"should be removed but got no support. He managed to get six of the twenty points cleared up, but then he was recalled to England in April 1942 despite the Canadian Chief of Air Staff requesting that he be allowed to remain. Keith was assigned to command the RAF Central Gunnery School at RAF Sutton Bridge, but after a short period of sickness and a recommendation from the medical officer that he should serve in the south of England he was listed as \\"supernumerary\\". In the Houses of Parliament on 3 February 1943 Tom Driberg, MP, asked why Keith had been recalled and why it was proposed to retire him, saying; \\"Is it not a fact that this officer was brought back from Canada after serving eight months, although it had been laid down that he should serve not less than 18 months, and that he was given the highest tributes, officially and unofficially, for his efficiency?\\" The Secretary of State for Air replied that a policy had been in place since \\"the summer of 1941, under which senior officers must give way to younger men when circumstances so require\\" and deplored that individual officers were named. Tom Driberg responded by saying \\"Is it not more deplorable that they should be treated unjustly?\\" Keith reports first hearing of this after receiving a copy of Hansard in the post. Within a few months he was retired and subsequently took a post with the BBC as an announcer. His insistence that hardships for RAF staff in Canada be removed led to two meetings of the Air Council and to a final concession of all the \\"20 points of hardships\\" he had raised. \\"I Hold My Aim\\" is the motto of the Air Gunnery School and the title of Keith's book published in 1946, it gives a fascinating glimpse into the work of a man who, perhaps more than any other individual can be said to have 'put the fire in the Spitfire'. He writes: :\\"I ran my Station commands as a dictator ‚Äì a benevolent one, I hope ‚Äì and I built the efficiency of my units through the happy, hard work of my airmen. They knew I should bite them when they deserved it, and fight like hell for them when they merited it. I have always refused to be a 'Yes Man' when it affected my doing what I thought to be right for those under me. That is probably why I am in plain clothes, as I write this book.\\" Sidelined from the official history except for a footnote as the Commanding Officer of an anonymous young pilot Group Captain Keith died in 1946 in Surrey. He was survived by his wife, Mary Gwendoline (n√©e Dunkerley).

His themes encompass questions of history and identity (particularly in the 1997 collection A Madder Ghost) and ‚Äì influenced by his translations of Rainer Maria Rilke ‚Äì more recent work focuses on the transformations of imagination and momentary epiphanies. His new translation of Rilke's Sonnets to Orpheus was published by Enitharmon in the autumn of 2012. Most recent publication is The Time We Turned published by Shearsman Books in 2014.  Life  Crucefix attended Trowbridge Boys High School, then spent a year studying Medicine at Guys Hospital Medical School, before switching to take a first class degree in English Literature at Lancaster University. He completed a D.Phil. at Worcester College, Oxford, writing on the poetry of Percy Bysshe Shelley and Enlightenment and Romantic theories of language. He currently teaches in North London and is married to Louise Tulip. They have two children Tom and Anna.  Poetry  Crucefix has won numerous prizes including an Eric Gregory Award and a Hawthornden Fellowship. He has published 6 original collections: Beneath Tremendous Rain (Enitharmon, 1990); At the Mountjoy Hotel (Enitharmon, 1993); On Whistler Mountain (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1994); A Madder Ghost (Enitharmon, 1997); An English Nazareth (Enitharmon, 2004); Hurt (Enitharmon, 2010). His translation of Rainer Maria Rilke's Duino Elegies (Enitharmon, 2006) was shortlisted for the 2007 Popescu Prize for European Poetry Translation and hailed as \\"unlikely to be bettered for very many years\\" (Magma) and by the Popescu judges as \\"a milestone of translation and a landmark in European poetry\\". An early selection of Crucefix's work secured an Eric Gregory Award in 1984 and appeared in The Gregory Poems: The Best of the Young British Poets 1983‚Äì84, edited and chosen by John Fuller and Howard Sergeant.The Gregory Poems: The Best of the Young British Poets 1983‚Äì84 (eds. John Fuller Howard Sergeant, Salamander Press, 1985) His first book, Beneath Tremendous Rain (Enitharmon, 1990) was published two years after he had been featured by Peter Forbes in a ‚ÄòNew British Poets‚Äô edition of Poetry Review. This collection contains his elegy for his friend, the poet and food writer, Jeremy Round, as well as the four part poem 'Water Music' and an extended meditation on language, love and history titled 'Rosetta'. For Herbert Lomas the book showed \\"Great intelligence and subtlety . . . clearly an outstanding talent from whom great things can be expected\\".Herbert Lomas, Ambit Anne Stevenson wrote: \\"Poetry these days, often feels obliged to place conscience over art and make language work for precision, not complexity. In Martyn Crucefix's first collection, something else happens . . . daring to break with secular convention, Crucefix will become a real artist\\".Anne Stevenson, Stand During a Hawthornden Fellowship in 1990, Crucefix completed the long poem, ‚ÄòAt The Mountjoy Hotel‚Äô, which went on to win second prize in the Arvon Poetry Competition 1991 (the poem was approvingly judged ‚Äúcontroversial‚Äù by Selima Hill, one of the selection panel that also included Andrew Motion) and was published as a short-run pamphlet by Enitharmon in 1993. It was also included in Crucefix's second collection, On Whistler Mountain (Sinclair-Stevenson, 1994), opening the book which also contained a second long narrative poem, 'On Whistler Mountain'. This second piece carries the dates New Year 1991 ‚Äì New Year 1993 and splices putative personal events with material from the First Gulf War, in particular the 'turkey-shoot' of the US air attack on Iraqi forces on the highway north of Al Jahra. Tony Harrison's poem 'A Cold Coming' (1991) refers to the same incident. Poetry Review thought the book proved Crucefix \\"one of the most mature voices of the 1990s\\"John Greening, Poetry Review and it was praised by Tim Liardet: \\"Crucefix is at his best, bringing physical truths faithfully into an intense focus whilst remaining alive to their more outlandish implications, their capacity for dream-making . . . . tendering poems of love and desire with great delicacy of gesture and movement . . . blending an earthy sensuality with fine cerebral observation\\".Tim Liardet, Poetry Wales Alan Brownjohn, writing in The Sunday Times wrote of it as a \\"substantial and rewarding collection . . . highly wrought, ambitious, thoughtful\\".The Sunday Times, 8 May 1994 A third collection, A Madder Ghost (Enitharmon, 1997), drew on material unearthed in genealogical research ten years earlier. This had revealed that Crucefix's ancestors to be of Huguenot origins, fleeing France in the 1780s to settle in Spitalfields, London, to continue the family trade of clock-making. The book's tripartite structure opens and closes with sequences of fluent, lightly-punctuated lyrics in which he explores the anxieties and anticipated pleasures of fatherhood, from conception through the first year of his son's life. Genealogical material forms the middle section and looks to the past for identity, continuity and new ways of understanding the present in a tour de force of narrative interweaving that Vrona Groarke described as \\"a brave experiment . . . allowing two languages distanced by history and syntax, to swim together in single poems\\".Vrona Groarke, P N Review 119 (1998) The book was praised by Anne Stevenson: \\"It is rare these days to find a book of poems that is so focused, so carefully shaped and so moving\\".Anne Stevenson, blurb for A Madder Ghost Kathryn Maris also praised it as \\"urgent, heartfelt, controlled and masterful\\"Kathryn Maris, Poetry London and Gillian Allnutt thought the poems timely in their engagement with \\"proactive fatherhood\\" in ways that were \\"tender, humorous and . . . profound\\".Gillian Allnutt, Poetry Review  Poetry Collections  * A Hatfield Mass (2014) * The Time We Turned (2014) * Hurt (2010, Enitharmon Press) * An English Nazareth (2004, Enitharmon Press) * A Madder Ghost (1997, Enitharmon Press) * On Whistler Mountain (1994) * At The Mountjoy Hotel (1993, Enitharmon Press) * Beneath Tremendous Rain (1990, Enitharmon Press)  Translations  * Daodejing ‚Äì a new version in English (2016, Enitharmon Press): translation * Rilke‚Äôs ‚ÄòSonnets to Orpheus‚Äô(2012, Enitharmon Press): translation * Rilke‚Äôs ‚ÄòDuino Elegies‚Äô (2006, Enitharmon Press): translation  Poems on the web  * Audio Recording made at The South Bank Centre in 2012. * Two poems from 'Essays in Island Logic' (from Hurt) * Three poems from 'Essays in Island Logic' (from Hurt) with accompanying essay * 'He considers what the young have to teach' (from Hurt) * 'Water-lily' (from Hurt) * 'While There is War' (with audio) (from Hurt) * 'Growth of a poet's mind' (from Hurt) * 'Invocation' (from Hurt) * 'Ivy tunnel at Kenwood' (uncollected) * 'Road' (uncollected) * 'On foot' (uncollected) * 'La Bastide- de-Bousignac' and 'Morning Song' (uncollected) * 'Tortoise' (from An English Nazareth)  Critical writing  * On recent contemporary poetry about the war in Iraq. * Review of Sinead Morrissey's Through the Square Window * Essay on Boris Pasternak's influence on the completion of 'Essays in Island Logic' (from Hurt) with three poems * On John Milton's On Education: BBC broadcast and the text available at and on YouTube. * ‚ÄúThe Drunken Porter Does Poetry: Metre and Voice in the Poems of Tony Harrison,\\" Originally published in Tony Harrison: Loiner, edited by Sandie Byrne, Clarendon Press, 1997, pp. 161‚Äì70. * Review of Michael Donaghy and Anne-Marie Fyfe * Review of Philip Levine and Dan Chiasson  References   External links  * *Review of Hurt by Ken Head *Review of Hurt by Zoe Brigley *Review of Hurt by Mike Loveday *Essay on Beneath Tremendous Rain and On Whistler Mountain by Michael Peverett Category:Living people Category:British translators Category:British poets Category:1956 births Category:Alumni of Lancaster University Category:British male poets ","title":"Martyn Crucefix"},{"id":"33725744","text":"Pito Villanon was a Cuban football player who spent eleven seasons with Brookhattan in the American Soccer League.

School and professional career  After finishing elementary school in 1925, Eugen Dobrogeanu attended the high school Gheorghe Sincai in Bucharest and acquired bachelor's degree in 1932. In the same year he was admitted to the gendarmerie officer school, which he graduated from in 1935. Subsequently, he acted as an instructor at the non-commissioned gendarmerie officer school in Foc≈üani, where he lectured on criminology and forensic science until 1940. As a graduate of law high school ‚Äì faculty of jurisprudence ‚Äì and holder of the antedoctorate oral examination in economy policy, Eugen Dobrogeanu published numerous studies about scientific police, criminology and applied criminology. In his work \\"The forensic science in the Romanian bibliography\\" (\\"The modern police\\", Focsani 1940) he emphasised, among other things, the merits of professors Drs. Nicolae Minovici and Mina Minovici, whose activity, within the scope of the forensic medicine research in Bucharest, put the basis of the Romanian forensic jurisprudence.Laz«ér C√¢rjan \\"Eugen Dobrogeanu ‚Äì primul bibliograf al criminalisticii rom√¢ne\\" (in \\"Analele Universita≈£ii Spiru Haret ‚Äì Seria Stiin≈£e Juridice ‚Äì Anul 8, 2010, Vol. I Editura Funda≈£iei Rom√¢nia de m√¢ine, pp. 11-29) At the beginning of 1941 Eugen Dobrogeanu was transferred to the supervisory office of the gendarmerie in Bucharest where he was appointed chief of the department for the pursuit of the Legionary Movement. In this function he conducted centralisation and systematisation of everyday information bulletins.  Participation in Operation Autonomous  Between 1943 and 1944 major Eugen Dobrogeanu was directly involved in the Operation Autonomous by order of general Constantin Tobescu, as a member of the military guard in charge with the custody of three English officers: Alfred Gardyne de Chastelain, Ivor Porter and Silviu Me≈£ianu, parachutists taken and held captive in Romania.Ivor Porter \\"Operation Autonomous: with SOE in Wartime Romania\\", Chatto and Windus 1989, pp. 120, 122, 140, 184, 265 In spite of all dangers Eugen Dobrogeanu maintained amicable relations with the prisoners while he helped them and delivered to them information about everyday events. Finally, he helped the English officers even in the procurement of the information which was to help them escape. Unfortunately, the plan could not be brought to execution as Eugen Dobrogeanu was suddenly transferred to the East front to Odessa.Cristian TroncotƒÉ \\"Eugen Cristescu ‚Äì asul serviciilor secrete rom√¢ne≈üti\\" Editura Roza V√¢nturilor, 1994 ‚Äì p. 451Direc≈£ia GeneralƒÉ a Arhivelor Statului, Centrul de Studii ≈üi cercetƒÉri de istorie ≈üi teorie militarƒÉ. \\"23 August 1944 ‚Äì Documente, Raport de lt. colonel De Chastelaine adresat Foreign Office-ului, privind evenimentele din perioada ≈üederii sale √Æn Rom√¢nia, December 1943 ‚Äì 23 August 1944\\" Editura Stiin≈£ificƒÉ ≈üi EnciclopedicƒÉ Bucure»ôti, 1984 ‚Äì p. 804  Postwar and later years  Between April, 1946 and March, 1948 Eugen Dobrogeanu worked as assistant chief commander of the gendarmerie officer school where he lectured on forensic science as well as methods of scientific police and fight against criminal economic activities. Afterwards he was recalled in the security of the capital city where he performed extensive work, not only by disclosure of the legionary organizations but also in the fight against the criminal economic activities. From September, 1948 to January, 1949 ‚Äì after the dissolution of the gendarmerie ‚Äì Eugen Dobrogeanu acted as a member of the Organizing committee of the Romanian militia. Then he was appointed as manager to the department of public security and maintenance of order, as well as head of the committee's office, and advanced to the rank of lieutenant-colonel. On 31 March 1951 Eugen Dobrogeanu was arrested under the accusation of \\"crime and intensive activity against the working class and revolutionary movement\\". After nearly 5 years of investigation he was acquitted according to the court decision No. 114/1956, found not guilty and declared innocent, under abolition of all imposed punishments and actions. Released from prison in 1956, Eugen Dobrogeanu worked first as a helper in a service transport company, then as an economist with the international trading agency \\"Romtrans\\" in Bucharest, from which post he went into retirement.

It consists of two locations: the Ladd Library, located at 3750 Williams Blvd SW, and the Downtown Library, located at 450 5th Avenue SE. The CRPL works in cooperation with the Marion Public Library and Hiawatha Public Library to form the Metro Library Network, which allows them to share a collection of materials, partner on programs, and make resources more available to all citizens. The Iowa flood of 2008, considered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to be \\"one of the worst and most costly floods in Iowa--and even U.S. history,\\" destroyed the building at the previous downtown location of the main branch, along with over half of the library's collection. The flooding of the library may have been the worst natural disaster to affect a public library. The new Cedar Rapids Public Library opened to the public on August 24, 2013. More than 8,000 people attended opening day festivities. In the first year of service, the new library saw over 660,000 visits from the community, and over 100,000 people used the meeting room spaces, including the new 200-seat Whipple Auditorium. History On March 2, 1896 the city of Cedar Rapids was to make a vote on whether or not they would have a public library. Due largely to the work of a group of women called the City Federation of Ladies Literary Clubs led by Ada Van Vechten, the vote was favorable. On January 15, 1897, the first public library was to open its doors to the citizens of Cedar Rapids. It was located in a small room of the Granby building. After a few years, the library had outgrown the room. It was moved to the Dows auditorium in May 1900. Andrew Carnegie was contacted in late January 1901 to request money to construct a dedicated library building. He agreed to give $75,000 if the town would pledge $7,500 in taxation annually to support the maintenance. In early 1903, the library chose Ely corner at Third Avenue and Fifth Street as the future site of the Carnegie library. On June 23, 1905, the new library was open. The years to follow were filled with a variety of strategies to expand services within the town and beyond. In 1910, E. Joanna Hagey became the librarian. She was the driving force behind the extension work for nearly three decades. Books were brought to schools, drug stores, and workplaces for extra convenience. Surrounding townships had contracted for library services. By 1928, six library stations were in operation. In 1930 there was a new Kenwood Park station, the first branch building owned by the library. During the Great Depression, circulation had reached record highs for the library. Beginning in 1933, the circulation began to fall as it had for other libraries across the nation. Everything started to normalize towards the end of the '30s. In 1940 there were 15 people staffing the library. The head librarian, who had replaced Hagey at the end of 1939, was Miss Alice Story. Another librarian that would later have a lasting effect on the library and the community, Evelyn Zerzanek, worked under Miss Story as the head librarian of the school and the children's department. Evelyn Zerzanek worked hard to not only get books into children's hands, but also to think for themselves and be creative. Under her direction, the summer reading programs and story times had increased in popularity. Evelyn also loved children's book illustrations. She started a collection that would grow to over 850 original paintings and drawings. In the early 1950s, two bookmobiles were purchased that had replaced all of the stations. Together they would make twelve stops each week at regular locations. Instead of many rented stations, the library now consisted of the two bookmobiles, the Kenwood Park station, and the main building. Crowding became a pressing issue for the library throughout the '60s. Much of the material had to be stored in the basement. New materials had to be turned away due to the space restrictions. In 1969, the library proposed to expand the current building and to establish a west- side branch. It failed to reach 60% voter approval. In 1971, a branch was established on Edgewood Road NW. The first two of three bookmobiles were retired by 1972. For the next twelve years, the library would be unsuccessful at securing a majority vote. The library had changed its proposal from remodeling the library to constructing a new facility during that time. In 1981, the Hall Foundation offered over 25% of the $7.9 million bond issue if the city would pay the remainder, but again, the 60% voter approval would not be met. About four months later, the Hall Foundation of Cedar Rapids offered to pay $6.8 million over the next ten years on the condition that the Library Foundation, established in 1972, could obtain $1 million in private donations. By the end of September, $1.3 million in private contributions had secured the amount necessary to move forward with the plans for a new library. The new library at 500 First Street SE opened on February 17, 1985. The floor space of the new building was 83,000 square feet compared with 29,000 square feet in the Carnegie building. Space issues were not the reason for moving as they had been in the past. The flood of 2008 had taken out much of the adult and reference collections. The children's books on the upper level, along with the Zerzanek collection, were all saved. The library would lease space at the Westdale Mall where they had already established a library branch in August 1988. The branch material would be consolidated with the library's surviving collection in the former Osco Drug Store space. In February 2013, the Ladd Library was opened, establishing a permanent west-side location/. On May 5, 2012, construction began on the new downtown location, which opened to the public in August 2013. Services The CRPL offers an abundance of regular services, including free computer classes, public computer and wifi access, and meeting rooms for the public. They offer a variety of programs including the Summer Reading Program, Adult Summer Reading Program, story times, and Play and Learn. There are a number of databases and other materials, such as e-books, downloadable audiobooks, and downloadable music, that can be accessed either at the library or remotely with a library card. Other events include author talks, live music, and art exhibits by local area artists. With the passing of the FY2017 Budget on January 7, 2016, voted on by the Cedar Rapids Public Library Board of Trustees, the library was subjected to budget costs totaling approximately $461,000. These cuts resulted in a reduction of library services, including operation hours. Effective starting March 27, 2016 both the Downtown and Ladd locations will be open Monday-Thursday, 9am-8pm and Fridays 9am-5pm. The Downtown Library will also be open on Saturday, 9am-5pm but closed on Sunday, while the Ladd location will be closed on Saturday and open Sunday, 1-5pm.

It is a heritage hotel in Chennai. Classified under the Taj Group's business hotels section, the 127-year-old hotel is considered the oldest hotel in the city. History The property of Taj Connemara was originally a house bought by John Binny from The Nawab of Arcot in 1799. The property was later bought by T. Somasundara Mudalyar and built as the Imperial Hotel in 1854 under the proprietorship of Triplicane Rathinavelu Mudaliar, renamed Albany in 1886 when it was leased to two other Mudaliar brothers, and re-established as The Connemara in 1890, named after the then Madras Governor during 1881‚Äì1886, Robert Bourke, baron of Connemara, a rural area in Counties Galway and Mayo in the West of Ireland, later becoming a Spencer's hotel. In 1891, Eugene Oakshott, owner of Spencer's, then a little shop near Anna Circle, bought the hotel and its nine acres to build a showroom. Oakshott wanted to give Spencer's a facelift, so he decided to build one of Asia's biggest departmental store. In the 1930s, James Stiven, director of Spencer's, modernised the hotel starting in 1934, and the modernisation was completed in 1937. It sported an art deco look when it was reopened in 1937. According to a hotel press release, the 1937 renovation, estimated at 575,000, boasted about its \\"cool refreshing air delivered through the newest air conditioning apparatus.\\" According to the first published tariff of the hotel, the cost of a room on single occupancy was 10 with breakfast and that of a room with all meals was 17.80. Spencer's leased the Connemara to the Taj Group in 1974. The tower block and linking pool was designed by architect Geoffrey Bawa in 1974, and the work was completed in 1977. The deluxe wing of the hotel was destroyed almost completely in the \\"Friday the Thirteenth\\" fire in February 1981, which broke out in the Spencer's building. However, the main building of the hotel remained unharmed because of the high-rise wall in between the two buildings. In 1984, the Taj Group of Hotels acquired the hotel for a 100-year lease from the Spencer's Group. The hotel saw two renovations in 1990 and 1995. The hotel was again renovated in 2004 and 2005, when the hotel was re-designed with the launch of the loud Distil bar and chic pan Asian restaurant Hip Asia, It is also when 65 rooms in the hotel were renovated. In 2008, historian S. Muthiah wrote a book on the heritage of the hotel, A Tradition of Madras that is Chennai‚ÄîThe Taj Connemara, which reproduces an advertisement from 1880 that states the hotel, called The Imperial Hotel then, promises \\"extensive premises‚Ä¶ cool and fitted with every convenience\\" and wines from the \\"celebrated house of Messrs. McDowell & Co.\\" The book gives a rare collection of photographs of old Madras roads, buildings, interiors of the hotels and the hotel's tariff since 1939. According to Muthiah, the British rated Connemara as one of the best hotels in the world. Although the building was purportedly 200 years old by the turn of the twenty-first century, dating back to the original garden house bought by John Binny, according to Muthiah nothing of the old structure remains. The oldest part of the hotel is that built in the 1880s and 1890s. In September 2010, the hotel was rebranded and renamed as Vivanta by Taj‚ÄîConnemara, Chennai. The hotel closed on 1 November 2016 for a major makeover to re-create the theme of its early past and reopen as an intimate high-end luxury hotel. Aiming at recreating old menus and cuisines, the renovation would retain only the Verandah and Raintree restaurants, refurbishing all the rooms, lobby and banquet halls to look more like the hotels early years. The renovation would be made by the Mumbai-based engineering consultancy Structwel Designers and Consultants Private Limited. Then, London-based designer Susan Freeman, a specialist in historical renovation was hired to work on the rooms and the restaurants. The hotel reopened on 20 October 2018 as the Taj Connemara. The renovation took 22 months, cost 900 million Rupees, and involved 1400 workers. The renovation preserved the architectural influences of Classic Colonial, Art Deco and distinctive elements from architect Geoffrey Bawa's \\"Tropical Modernism\\" style. The Art Deco fa√ßade and interiors are the hotel's original features, including wooden carvings sourced from the 16th and 17th century temples of Mahabalipuram. Given its centuries-old background, the hotel boasts some historical snippets: *The stone pillars in the hotel's Raintree pathway and the wooden carvings in the grand staircase wall, both of which date back to the 16th and 17th centuries, are from old temples of Mahabalipuram. *The lobby has a grand piano that dates back to 1922, which used to be played in the ballroom in the evenings during the post-war era, and is still played on weekdays. *Nagavelli well, located in the hotel, never dries up even during the peak of summer when all other wells in the city dry up. *The Lady Connemara Bar & Lounge is the city's first licensed bar. Location Taj Connemara is located on the eastern banks of River Cooum on Binny Road, off Anna Salai, abutting the Spencer Plaza, one of the most prominent landmarks of Chennai. The hotel Built on a 4.2-acre land, Taj Connemara has a total of 147 rooms, which include 143 double rooms and 4 suites. The hotel has 2 meeting rooms which include a ball room that can accommodate up to 400 people in a theatre style and up to 600 people for cocktails. The conference room of the hotel can accommodate up to 30 people in a theatre style. The restaurants in the hotel include The Verandah‚Äîa 24-hour coffee shop serving Indian, Continental and Thai food, The Lady Connemara Bar and Lounge‚Äîserving exotic cocktails, spirits, wines, beer and light snacks in a colonial ambiance, Raintree‚Äîan ethnic, open-air restaurant serving Chettinad cuisine from Tamil Nadu. Greeneries in the hotel include a dramatic old raintree and two sturdy Nagavalli trees. Notable associations For decades, the hotel has been integral to the functioning of several clubs and associations in the city. The Rotary Club of Madras has been meeting in the hotel every Tuesday at 1:00 p.m. since 10 May 1929, and plaque has been erected past the ballroom to mark this. The Wednesday Club has been gathering in the hotel since 1975, taking \\"the same table at Verandah every week, and always have the lunch buffet.\\" The Madras Book Club has been meeting in the hotel since the 2000s.

He was Professor of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), Radulovacki's research accomplishments include: (1) the Adenosine Sleep Theory, and (2) pioneering pharmacological studies for the treatment of sleep apnea, together with research collaborator, David W. Carley, (Professor of Medicine at the UIC). Radulovacki and Carley invented several drug therapies for the treatment of sleep apnea which have been patented by the UIC. The UIC recognized them as the 2010 \\"Inventors of the Year.\\" Radulovacki published more than 170 scientific papers. Radulovacki was also a Foreign Member of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts. Early life Miodrag Radulovacki was born on April 28, 1933, in Parage, a village in northwestern Serbia. Both of his parents were elementary school teachers. At the beginning of World War II, Radulovacki's father was drafted into the Yugoslav Army and was later taken prisoner by the invading Germans. In 1943, Radulovacki moved to Sremski Karlovci after his mother accepted a teaching position in the town. Sremski Karlovci (also known as Karlovci), a baroque Serbian town on the banks of the Danube River, had been home to the Radulovacki family for over 200 years. Radulovacki attended Karlovci High School or \\"Gymnasium,\\" which is the oldest high school in Serbia. Radulovacki called Karlovci Gymnasium the \\"Serbian Cambridge and Oxford\\". Radulovacki graduated as valedictorian of the Karlovci High School Class of 1951. Radulovacki gained admission to the University of Belgrade School of Medicine. Education and scientific career Radulovacki graduated from the University of Belgrade School of Medicine in 1959.Summary biography of Miodrag Radulovacki, Illinois Medicine Fiscal Year 2009 Report - Honor Roll of Donors, page 27 (Prizing Discovery)University of Illinois, Dr. Miodrag Radulovacki profileUniversity of Illinois Department of Pharmacology Faculty Profiles He went on to obtain a PhD in Neurophysiology. The topic of his PhD thesis was: \\"Sleep in Split-Brain Cats,\\" partly done at the Brain Research Institute at UCLA. Radulovacki spent 18 months at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Brain Research InstituteUCLA Brain Research Institute where his mentor was Ross Adey. One of the findings of his research at UCLA was that the electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern of sleep in cats with split brain to the pons is synchronous in both brain hemispheres, indicating the importance of the brainstem in sleep regulation. In 1966, Radulovacki accepted a teaching position with the Physiology Department in the College of Medicine at the University of Khartoum, Sudan. There he invented an approach for obtaining cerebrospinal fluid using a cannula to the cisterna magna in the brain of cats. The cannulation method enabled researchers to obtain cerebrospinal fluid during sleep and wakefulness for the analysis of monoamine metabolites. This approach was of interest since Michel Jouvet's Monoamine Theory of Sleep, with serotonin as the sleep inducing agent, was dominant at the time. From 1970 to 1984, at the University of Illinois, Radulovacki published a series of papers dealing with the role of monoamines in sleep. In 1970, Radulovacki was recruited by Klaus Unna to join the Department of Pharmacology in the College of Medicine at the University of Illinois at Chicago as an Assistant Professor. Radulovacki published more than 170 scientific papers during his career at the UIC.  Scientific achievements  = Adenosine Sleep Theory = In 1984, Radulovacki postulated the Adenosine Sleep Theory, (JPET, 228: 268-274, 1984). The idea for adenosine's role in sleep occurred to him after reading a paper by Sol Snyder's group (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 78: 3260-64, 1981) about the importance of adenosine receptors in the behavioral actions of methylxanthines. In the article, the authors correlated the behavioral excitation produced by theophylline in micromolar concentrations with the blockade of adenosine receptors. Radulovacki reasoned that if the blocking of adenosine receptors produces excitation, then perhaps stimulation of the same receptors could induce sleep. He knew that experiments by John Phillis and his group (Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol. 57:1289-1312, 1979), which utilized an iontophoretic application of adenosine in the brain, had demonstrated adenosine's depressant effect on the responses of neurons in several brain regions and that the general neurophysiological effects of adenosine were shown to be inhibitory. In addition, the preliminary experiments in dogs by Haulica et al. (J. Neurochem. 21:,1019‚Äì20, 1973) and the administration of adenosine into the brains of rats, cats and fowl suggested that adenosine was able to produce behavioral sleep. The explanation of adenosine's hypnotic effect was through its interaction with serotonin, widely believed to be a sleep inducing agent. However, since there was no suggestion how this adenosine-serotonin link was achieved, experiments highlighting the potential role of adenosine in sleep had largely been forgotten. =Research collaboration with David W. Carley= In 1993, Radulovacki started a collaboration with David W. Carley, a Professor of Medicine, Bioengineering and Pharmacology at the UIC. Their research efforts focused on developing pharmacological approaches for the treatment of sleep apnea. Since there were no medicines to alleviate this condition, Radulovacki and Carley set out to develop a drug treatment. Their initial work focussed on an experimental model of sleep apnea in rats, initially testing the effects of adenosine compounds. Eventually, they obtained positive results using serotonin and other compounds. As a result, the UIC patented their discoveries, obtaining numerous US and international patents.Patents by the UIC, Pharmacological Treatments for Sleep Disorders.

Geisel umpired in three World Series (1930, 1934, and 1936) and in two All-Star Games (1935 and 1938. In his career, he umpired 2,554 Major League games.Retrosheet Notable games In 1932, Geisel was the home plate umpire when Lou Gehrig became the first modern major league player to hit four home runs in a single game. Geisel worked the 1934 World Series game in which angry Detroit fans threw bottles and vegetables in protest of an aggressive slide by Joe Medwick of St. Louis. Geisel worked with future Hall of Fame umpire Jocko Conlan in Conlan's 1935 debut as an umpire. Geisel's partner had been overcome by heat that day. Conlan, then an aging player with the Chicago White Sox, volunteered to fill in as an umpire since he was unable to play due to a thumb injury. He worked the plate for the only opening day no-hitter in MLB history on April 16, 1940, thrown by Bob Feller against the Chicago White Sox.Tuesday, April 16, 1940, Comiskey Park I In 1942, Geisel collided with Yankees hurler Spud Chandler. The resulting injuries led to Geisel's retirement after a seven-week hospitalization. Involvement in other sports During the baseball offseason, Geisel served as an announcer for boxing prize fights. Following his umpiring career, Geisel became athletic director at the Indiana Boys School. He died in 1966 in an Indiana hospital at the age of 75. Giesel is the great-uncle of Paul Page, the radio voice of the Indianapolis 500.

Early years Luiswishi was one of the first copper and cobalt mines to be exploited in Katanga by Belgium, opened around 1900. Production came to an end in 1962. In 1980 the state-controlled G√©camines started fresh prospecting, but abandoned the project due to budgetary problems. In 1998 G√©camines signed a contract with a subsidiary of Groupe Forrest International to re-open the mine. Resources were estimated at between 7.5 and 8 million tons of ore graded 2.8% copper and 1.0% cobalt. Later operations As of 2002, the Mine was estimated to have a production capacity of about 4,500 tonnes per year of cobalt in concentrates. A joint venture between G√©camines and l'Enterprise G√©n√©rale Malta Forrest was producing copper-cobalt concentrates from the mine, exported to OM Group's Kokkola refinery in Finland under a long-term supply contract. In November 2002, Forrest announced that the mine would close for an indefinite period of time for a complete refurbishment and to make improvements to the flotation plant, which had been in continuous operation for 5 years. The mine reopened in April 2003 and quickly resumed full production. In December 2008 the mine closed again due to low cobalt prices. Compagnie Miniere du Sud Katanga (CMSK) operates the mine, owned 60% by Enterprise G√©n√©rale Malta Forrest, a subsidiary of Groupe Forrest International and 40% by G√©camines. CMSK was formed in January 2004 and owns the rights to Luiswishi mine and also to Luishia Mine, inactive as of 2011. The ore is concentrated in CMSK's plant at Kinpushi before being shipped abroad for processing. CMSK employs about 300 people directly, and another 350 serve as contractors. CMSK produces 12,000 tons of copper annually and about 4,000 tons of cobalt. This is about 8% of world cobalt production. Alleged safety issues In December 2010 WikiLeaks published cables that they alleged showed that US officials were ignoring reports of dangerously high levels of radiation at Luiswishi mine, and implied that uranium was being separated from the ore which purportedly held only copper and cobalt. Groupe Forrest International refuted rumors of radiation or illegal trading in uranium. Forrest noted that although uranium was present in the copper and cobalt ore from the mine, it was at far too low a grade to be exploited. Forrest also said the radioactivity in the Luiswishi mine was largely lower than the European standards. DRC government officials and United Nations personnel had visited the mine and found no problems.

Chill umpired in the 1921 World Series. In his career, he umpired 1,028 Major League games.Retrosheet Off the field, Chill was involved in a 1923 fight that led to the shooting death of one man. Though Chill was acquitted of the man's murder and a shooter came forward, he was removed from the American League umpiring staff. Umpiring career On May 15, 1914, Chill was attacked after a game at the Polo Grounds by New York Yankees fans who were upset by calls that Chill had made that game. Chill was eventually ushered to the umpires' room by police. In January 1923, Chill was one of several men questioned in the death of Edward J. McGregor, a man found shot in his apartment in Cleveland after a drunken party. When police broke into the apartment after reports of a shooting, they found Chill under a bed, with the other men each in separate rooms. He was acquitted of the murder later that month, when another man admitted to shooting McGregor after attempting to intervene in a fight between McGregor and Chill only for McGregor to fire twice at him. Nevertheless, Chill was dismissed from the American League by league president Ban Johnson following the incident. In 1926, Chill was dismissed as an umpire from the American Association for registering at a Kansas City hotel where he had been given specific orders not to stay. In 1927, Chill filed suit against the league for $200,000 in damages, claiming he had been slandered. Chill dropped the suit in November of that year after an out-of-court settlement. Personal life Prior to his umpiring career, Chill boxed under the name \\"Jack Ryan.\\" He also ran a wholesale fish house specializing in Florida stone crab in Pass-a-Grille, Florida. In 1933, Chill was named as one of Minnesota's official boxing referees after retiring from umpiring in baseball's International League the year before.

Burford Methodist Church is a baroque building in the High Street of Burford, Oxfordshire. It was built between about 1715 and 1730 as a private house and converted in 1849 to a Wesleyan Chapel. It is a Grade II* Listed Building. Ethos Baroque architecture flowered for only a very brief period in Britain's architectural history, reaching its apex under the guidance of such architects as John Vanbrugh and Nicholas Hawksmoor who transformed the more florid European style of Baroque, as promoted by Christopher Wren, into a more severe form peculiar to Britain. There, Baroque tended to be favoured by the travelled upper classes, who had seen the genre in mainland Europe, however, even by this minority it was not universally admired. When John Vanbrugh persuaded the government and the saviour of England, John Churchill, 1st Duke of Marlborough, to permit him to design Blenheim Palace in the Baroque style, Marlborough's wife the formidable Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough was accompanied by a large group of intellectuals, who included Alexander Pope, in being strongly critical.Green, p4. Therefore, to find an early example of the Baroque in the high street of a small provincial English town is unusual, more unusual, is that the building sits on a small site still surrounded by its original neighbours - older, smaller medieval buildings which though rare today in their surviving quantity and composition are or little individual architectural merit and serve to accentuate the height and classicism of their more refined neighbour; thus, the church retains a setting which is part of Baroque architecture's original concept - the element of surprise; until the early 20th century, this was exemplified by the sight of St. Peter's Basilica rising incongruously out of the jumble of medieval architecture that was the Borgo before the creation of the Via della Conciliazione, which although it has created a grand approach and perspective to the Basilica has taken away the Baroque element of surprise as one suddenly came upon the Piazza San Pietro from the jumble of narrow streets and small squares. Architecture The church was designed as a private house, for a local lawyer, John Jordan.Pevsner, p509. The building is on three floors, a high and clearly visible semi-basement, which would have contained the kitchens and domestic secondary rooms; the first floor which was thee principal floor containing the main reception rooms and entrance and the 2nd floor containing principal bedrooms. Given the date of the house, it's possible that the principal bedroom was on the first floor in the piano nobile style, but no documentary evidence survives describing the original layout. The front (and only) fa√ßade is fully rusticated from the 1st floor upwards; it is of five bays divided by six fluted pilasters surmounted by Corinthian capitals which are united by an entablature supporting a balustraded parapet. The principal entrance which occupies the central bay of the first floor is heavily pedimented in the style of James Gibbs and reached by a flight of steps which rise over and shield from view the entrance to semi-basement. This secondary entrance to the house, intended only for use by servants and tradesmen is reached by a descending, segmented external double staircase, a common enough feature in a baroque house ascending the principal entrance, but rare when descending to a secondary entrance. The windows are ornamented by dropped keystones and aprons. In order to maintain the scale and perspective of the building, the windows are by necessity long and narrow this creates an illusion of greater height ‚Äî illusion being a typical Baroque feature.Baroque architecture. The illusion has been somewhat modified, however, by the late 19th century replacement glazing bars on the first and second floors. The glazing bars on the ground floor, which are likely to be original, give smaller panes which are more in the English Baroque style as seen at other contemporary baroque buildings, such as Easton Neston. The crowded features of the Baroque fa√ßade are not dissimilar to those at Heythrop Park, also in Oxfordshire, where Francis Smith, the architect, worked as building contractor. Conversion to a chapel In 1849 the house was sold and converted into a church. The conversion work involved the complete gutting of the upper two floors. These became one vast hall intended for use as worship. A large indoor balcony, intended to provide extra seating, was erected at first floor level and the ornamental urns which decorated the balustraded parapet were removed as \\"inconsistent with the sacred character of the building.\\" Present use The building is still used as a Methodist church and is part of the Witney and Faringdon Methodist circuit. The basement is let out to supplement the church's income.

The archaeologist Henri Lhote next to rock art in modern-day Mauritania Ancient history In Charles Becker's paper titled \\"Vestiges historiques, tr√©moins mat√©riels du pass√© clans les pays Sereer\\", two types of Serer relics were noted: \\"the non-material remains which are cultural in nature\\" and \\"material remains, which are many revealed through products or artefacts.\\" The historical vestiges of Serer country in modern-day Senegambia, the diversity of Serer culture manifested across dialects, family and social organisation which reflect different historical territories were observed. Although many Serer artefacts remain unknown, unlisted and preserved despite the efforts in the 1960s and 1970s to collect, archive and document them all, many material relics were found in different Serer countries, most of which refer to the past origins of Serer families, villages and Serer Kingdoms. Some of these Serer relics included gold, silver and metals.Charles Becker et Victor Martin, Rites de s√©pultures pr√©islamiques au S√©n√©gal et vestiges protohistoriques, Archives Suisses d'Anthropologie G√©n√©rale, Imprimerie du Journal de Gen√®ve, Gen√®ve, 1982, tome 46, N¬∞ 2, p. 261-293 The known objects found in Serer countries, are divided into two types: 1\\\\. the remnants of earlier populations. ::\\" These are the traces left by the proto-populations with which the Sereer were in contact when they came from the Fuuta\\". 2\\\\. Laterite megaliths carved planted in circular structures with stones directed towards the east are found only in small parts of the ancient Serer kingdom of Saloum. ::The sand tumulus, on the other hand which resembles ancestral tombs (\\"lomb\\" in Serer language) still built by Serers are observed everywhere including the Kingdom of Sine, Jegem (Njegem), Kingdom of Saloum.Cyr Descamps, Guy Thilmans et Y.

In the provinces of the Gandun, Numi, Saloum and south-western Sine around Joal, 139 sites have been identified and they sometimes have shaped burial mounds.Cyr Descamps, Guy Thilmans et Y.

The graves of the founding ancestors were also very often sanctified as \\"Fangool\\" (singular of Pangool: \\"ancestral spirit\\" or \\"saint\\" in Serer religion). Such relics associated with the ancestors are often venerated relics. For example, the relics evoking memories of migration or foundation of states are sometimes sacralised. The remnants of royalty in the Kingdoms of Sine and Saloum are similar because the \\"Geulowars\\" (the last maternal dynasty in Sine and Saloum - 14th to 20th centuryAlioune Sarr. Histoire du Sine- Saloum. Introduction, bibliographie et Notes par Charles Becker, BIFAN, Tome 46, Serie B, n¬∞ 3-4, 1986-1987) have the same Serer tradition, but there are peculiarities in the objects and the scene of the coronation of royalty and power which have existed since the beginnings of dynasty with the annual ritual and mandatory ceremonies. The family relics in other Serer countries which are brought from Takrur (now Futa Toro) or Kaabu by the founders were also noted in places of worship of the village or province history. This may be stone, wood, musical instruments, ceremonial objects used by the Saltigue (Serer High Priests and Priestesses) or \\"Yaal Pangool\\". These relics kept by families since ancient times remain largely unknown. There are two types of Serer relics relating to two lineages that come into play in the social organisation of the Serer people: * \\"kucarla\\" - which means paternal lineage or paternal inheritance. * \\"∆≠een yaay\\" - which means maternal lineage or maternal inheritance.

With the old paper notes, $5 and $10 generally wore out in a few months, polymer lasts 4 to 7 years on average and many notes dated 1999 can still be found in circulation. The higher values were released in mid 2016. As of August 2019, less than half of the $5 and $10 in circulation are these new type, with the Fourth issue notes still dominating. Security features The note has a see-through window of a fern on the left and another on the right. When the bill is shown to the light, a watermark of Elizabeth II is displayed. There is intaglio printing through the bill which gives it an embossed feel. Under UV light a yellow patch will appear with the denomination of the bill. There is a perfect register of a fern located above the see- through window, the two sides should be perfect when held up to the light.

The Colombian Conflict began in the mid-1960s and is a low-intensity asymmetric war between Colombian governments, paramilitary groups, crime syndicates, and left-wing guerrillas such as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), and the National Liberation Army (ELN), fighting each other to increase their influence in Colombian territory. Two of the most important international actors that have contributed to the Colombian conflict are multinational companies and the United States. Elements of all the armed groups have been involved in drug-trafficking. In a country where the presence of the state has always been weak, the result has been a grinding war on multiple fronts, with the civilian population caught in the crossfire and often deliberately targeted for \\"collaborating\\". Human rights advocates blame paramilitaries for massacres, \\"disappearances\\", and cases of torture and forced displacement. Rebel groups are behind assassinations, kidnapping and extortion.

The 40-year low in murders came the same year that the Colombian government signed a peace agreement with the FARC. Since the beginning of the crisis in Bolivarian Venezuela and the mass emigration of Venezuelans during the Bolivarian diaspora, desperate Venezuelans have resorted to crime and have been recruited into gangs in order to survive. Venezuelan women have also resorted to prostitution in order to make a living in Colombia.  Crime by type  = Murder= 2012 Car Bombing in Bogota Colombia targeting the former minister, Fernando Londo√±o. According to a study by Colombia's National Centre for Historical Memory, 220,000 people have died in the conflict between 1958 and 2013, most of them civilians (177,307 civilians and 40,787 fighters) and more than five million civilians were forced from their homes between 1985 ‚Äì 2012, generating the world's second largest population of internally displaced persons (IDPs). 16.9% of the population in Colombia has been a direct victim of the war. 2.3 million children have been displaced from their homes, and 45,000 children killed, according to national figures cited by Unicef. In total, one in three of the 7.6 million registered victims of the conflict are children, and since 1985, 8,000 minors have disappeared. In 2016, Colombia had a murder rate of 24.4 per 100,000 population, the lowest since 1974. = Illegal drug trade in Colombia = Colombia has had four major drug trafficking cartels which eventually created a new social class and influenced several aspects of Colombian culture. Coca, marijuana and other drugs had been part of the lifestyle of some Colombians, but the worldwide demand of psychoactive drugs during the 1960s and 1970s eventually increased the production and processing of these in Colombia. Cocaine is produced at $1500/kilo in jungle labs and could be sold on the streets of America for as much as $80,000/kilo. The initial boom in production of drugs in Colombia for export began with marijuana in the 1960s, followed by cocaine in the mid- to late-1970s. The United States intervened in Colombia throughout this period in an attempt to cut off the supply of these drugs to the US. Since the establishment of the War on Drugs, the United States and European countries have provided financial, logistical, tactical and military aid to the government of Colombia in order to implement plans to combat the illegal drug trade. The most notable of these programs has been the Plan Colombia which also intended to combat organizations, such as the FARC guerrillas, who have controlled many coca-growing regions in Colombia over the past decades. Despite Colombia having the dubious distinction of being the world leading producer of coca for many years those plans, slowly but surely, diminished the drug produced, to the extent that in 2010 the country reduced cocaine production by 60%, relative to the peak in 2000. In that same year, Peru surpassed Colombia as the main producer of coca leaves in the world. The level of drug related violence was halved in the last 10 years, when the country moved from being the most violent country in the world to have a homicide rate that is inferior to the one registered in countries like Honduras, Jamaica, El Salvador, Venezuela, Guatemala, Trinidad and Tobago and South Africa. = Kidnapping = At the turn of the millennium Colombia had the highest rates of kidnapping in the world, a result of being one of the most cost-effective ways of financing for the guerrillas of the FARC and the ELN and other armed groups. But the security situation has much improved and the groups involved today have been much weakened. The administration of President Uribe has sought to professionalize the armed forces and to engage them more fully in the counterinsurgency war; as a result, the armed groups have suffered a series of setbacks. Police in Colombia say the number of people kidnapped has fallen 92% since 2000. Common criminals are now the perpetrators of the overwhelming majority of kidnappings. By the year 2016, the number of kidnappings in Colombia had declined to 205 and it continues to decline. In general, one is much more likely to encounter a Colombian army checkpoint than an illegal guerrilla roadblock. = Corruption = Corruption in Colombia is a pervasive problem at all levels of government. A 2005 study published by Transparency for Colombia (Transparencia por Colombia) assessed the index of integrity of governments, assemblies and comptrollers at the departmental level and concluded that none of those dependencies scored an appropriate level of integrity. 51% were prone to high or very high levels of corruption. Many institutions in Colombia have been the subject of administrative corruption. Large institutions that span across industries are example of major cases of corruption including: Ferrovias (national railroad administration), Caprecom (health care), Foncolpuertos (ports authority), Termorrio (energy), Dragacol (civil engineering), Chivor reservoir (water supply) and contracts with foreign companies such as Mexican ICA for the pavement of streets in Bogota are just some of them. = Domestic violence = Although prohibited by law, domestic violence in Colombia is a serious problem.Report on Human Rights Practices 2006: Colombia. United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor (March 6, 2007). This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Judicial authorities may remove an abuser from the household and require therapy or re- education. The Institute for Legal Medicine and Forensic Science reported approximately 33,000 cases of domestic violence against women during 2006.  Regional crime  = Bogot√° = Bogot√° has gone to great lengths to change its crime rate and its image with increasing success after being considered in the mid-90s to be one of the most violent cities in the world. In 1993 there were 4,352 intentional homicides at a rate of 81 per 100,000 people; in 2007, Bogot√° suffered 1,401 murders at a rate of 19 per 100,000 inhabitants. This success was the result of a participatory and integrated security policy, \\"Comunidad Segura\\", that was first adopted in 1995 and continues to be enforced. Today, Bogota's violent crime rate is lower than that of many US cities such as Indianapolis, Indiana. According to a 2011 article in The New York Times 'street muggings and thefts on public transportation have surged since 2007', leading certain commentators to declare a crisis of security in the city. = Cali = Crime is a serious problem in Cali. As of 2006, there were 1,540 intentional homicides in the city and 1,726 overall when including the metropolitan area. The rates for the city and metropolitan area were 62 and 63 per 100,000 respectively. By 2011 this has increased to 71 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants, which has led certain commentators to declare a 'crisis of security' in Cali. Between 1 January and 1 June 2011 there were 923 intentional homicides in the inner city of Cali, which is considered a 5% increase compared to 2010. The surge in violence in Cali in 2011 has partly been attributed to what has been described as an ongoing 'mafia war' between the 'neo-paramilitary' groups Los Rastrojos and the Usuga Clan. Los Rastrojos are considered the 'heirs' of the Cali Cartel and the Usuga Clan have their roots in Colombia's atlantic coast. Los Rastrojos are accused of committing at least 80 murders in Cali in 2011. According to Colombia's most influential weekly magazine, Semana, there are over 1,700 assassins working for various groups in the city. As of 2011 urban militias, known as Milicias Populares, of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia are active in the city and surrounding areas. Local civilians and foreigners have been advised by the DAS to take caution due to the risk of planted bombs and kidnappings.Colombia The metropolitan police and the Colombian Army have taken action to stop several high-profile bomb attacks against military and administrative centers in recent years, such as the multiple FARC attacks against Cali's Palace of Justice in 2008 and 2010. These FARC militias in the Cali metropolitan area are thought to number more than 1000, and have caused serious concern among the authorities as they have stepped up activity in 2011. In 2016 and 2017, Cali experienced a great drop in homicide rate, lowering to 51 per 100,000 inhabitants. = Medell√≠n = Central Medell√≠n. Medell√≠n was once known as the most violent city in the world, a result of an urban war set off by the drug cartels at the end of the 1980s. As the home of the Medell√≠n Cartel funded by Pablo Escobar, the city was victim of the terror caused by the war between the organization headed by Escobar, and competing organizations such as \\"El Cartel del Valle\\". However, after the death of Escobar, crime rates in the city began to decrease.BBC. \\"Fuego cruzado en Medell√≠n.\\" 17 October 2002. BBCMundo.com. 3 May 2009. Throughout the rest of the 1990s crime rates remained relatively high, although gradually declining from the worst years. In October 2002, President √Ålvaro Uribe ordered the military to carry out \\"Operation Orion,\\" whose objective was to disband the urban militias of the FARC and the AUC. Between 2003 and 2006 the demobilization of the remaining urban militias of the AUC was completed, with more than 3,000 armed men giving up their weapons. Nonetheless after the disbanding of the main paramilitary groups, many members of such organizations have been known to have reorganized into criminal bands known commonly as Aguilas Negras. These groups have gained notoriety in Medell√≠n for calling upon curfews for the underage population, and have been known to distribute fliers announcing the social cleansing of prostitutes, drug addicts, and alcoholics.Caracol Radio. \\"Las '√Åguilas Negras' anuncian limpieza social en un sector de Medell√≠n\\". Enero 31 de 2008. The extradition of paramilitary leader Don Berna appears to have sparked a crime wave with a sharp increase in killings. There were 33% more murders in 2008 than 2007, with an increase from 654 to 871 violent deaths. This increased further by over 200% in 2009 to 2,899 violent deaths, or about 110 deaths per 100,000 people, 2.5 times the average homicide rate in Colombia and 20 times the average homicide rate in the United States for that same year. An average of 9 people were killed every day in 2009. There is a significant disparity in crime rates by neighborhoods, with virtually no homicides in El Poblado to areas with open gunfights in the outskirts. Generally, crime rates increase the further the neighborhood is from the center. In contrast to lower homicide rates in recent years, armed robberies increased by 19% from 2018 to 2019, to more than 21000 per year. Rates of armed robbery in Medellin has been increasing every year since 2011, when 1584 such crimes were reported. From 2016 to 2017, armed robberies increased from 8900 to more than 17,700 cases, partly due to a new law that allows citizens to report armed robberies themselves. The city‚Äôs downtown area is the most frequent location for armed robbery, because hundreds of thousands of people visit every day to go to work. However, robberies in affluent districts like Poblado and Laureles / Estadio have also been on the rise. https://data.colombiareports.com/medellin- crime-security-statistics/ By 2015, the homicide rate has fallen to 20 per 100,000 people, the lowest rate in decades. By 2019, the homicide rate had risen to 24.75 per 100,000 people. = Buenaventura = Buenaventura has had a notorious history plagued by the Colombian armed conflict, drug trafficking, violence, and the presence of guerrilla and paramilitary groups. Due to the violence of Buenaventura The New York Times wrote an article with the title being \\"Cocaine Wars Make Port Colombia‚Äôs Deadliest City\\". Colombian authorities have seized almost US$28 million in cash from drug kingpins. The money found was in several shipping containers sent from Manzanillo, Colima (Mexico) and Houston (United States), that belonged to brothers Luis Enrique and Javier Antonio Calle Serna, also known as the ‚ÄòCombas‚Äô. In the last two years, the amount of reported homicides has doubled. The murder rate is 24 times that of New York City, making it a crime rate of 175.2. To counter the violence, the Colombian government has set up a marine special forces unit in the worst area of the city. = Barranquilla = In Barranquilla, in 2007 there were 348 homicides compared to 391 in 2006, a decrease of 11% over the previous year. In Colombia, in 2007 the homicide rate per 100,000 population from Barranquilla (22) was only exceeded by those of Cali (57), Bucaramanga (32) and Medell√≠n (30). In the six years from 2002 to 2007, however, the number of homicides declined, with the lowest number occurring in 2007 compared to a peak of 483 killings in 2003. Thugs (42.24%), fights (31.61%) and robberies (14.94%) accounted for the main types of homicide in the city. Historically, the days when most homicides occur are Saturday and Sunday, but in 2007 there was a uniform distribution (approximately 15%) on all days. 85.23% of homicides are by firearm; Barranquilla and Cali in 2007 recorded the highest percentage of homicides involving firearms in Colombia. Most homicides are concentrated in the centre and south of the city. Another type of crime in Barranquilla that also showed a growth trend over the past two years was theft, commercial entities (713 in 2007, 630 in 2006, mainly in the north and centre), residences (528 in 2007, 467 in, 2006 mainly in the north), financial institutions (20 in 2006 21 in 2007 mainly in the north) and people (2,692 in 2007, 2,146 in 2006, mainly in the centre, north and south).  Crime prevention  In 2011, President Juan Manuel Santos launched a \\"Borders for Prosperity\\" plan to fight poverty and combat violence from illegal armed groups along Colombia's borders through social and economic development, having spent as much as $32 million on infrastructure, education, agricultural development and governance by 2014. According to the International Crisis Group, the plan \\"appears to be having a positive impact, especially in marginalized communities with little or no state presence\\".

The company serves a simple menu that changes day to day and with the seasons based on what is available from local farmers and includes a large mix of organic ingredients. Overview The company began in October 2008 as one food truck serving the area around the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). As of summer 2018, Clover Food Lab had some 400 employees operating in 12 restaurants across the greater Boston area. Environmental vision The company was founded by Ayr Muir, a graduate of MIT in Material Science and Harvard Business School MBA program. Muir, a distant cousin of naturalist John Muir, has cited environmental motivations as a driving force behind the company's creation. He wishes \\"to shrink the ecological footprint of the food industry by making fresh, local, sustainable vegetarian food as common and convenient as the fare at Burger King or McDonald's\\". The company's food trucks are decommissioned and retrofitted cargo vehicles that use recycled vegetable oil to help them run. All of the company's utensils, napkins, and other items are compostable. Despite Clover Food Lab's focus on local, sustainable and vegetarian food, Muir consciously avoids branding the company's food as such, fearing that \\"no one will eat it if we do\\". Design Clover Food Lab's restaurant in Harvard Square Clover Food Lab's trucks and restaurants have minimalist, somewhat industrial design, and include elements that give them the look and feel of a laboratory. The sides and walls are plain white, menus are written on whiteboards with black dry-erase marker, and the restaurants are brightly lit and have mostly stool seating. The kitchen has \\"a pop-up quality, as if the crew is here temporarily, planning to relocate elsewhere.\\" Staff enter customer orders and process credit and debit cards through an iPod touch system, and give change from their money belts instead of cash registers. Reception Clover Food Lab's BLT sandwich uses soy bacon, and has been cited as the best BLT sandwich in Boston by Mayor Thomas Menino. The company was a winner of the Food Truck Challenge, a competition initiated by Menino to bring healthy mobile food vending to Boston, which has led to a rising trend in the city in the use of food and coffee trucks. Clover Food Lab was named one of the top 10 food trucks in the United States by The Wall Street Journal, and given the 2011 Best of Boston award for vegetarian food by The Improper Bostonian. The company was one of several food truck services highlighted by The Huffington Post for its intense use of technology (especially social media), distinctive product, and cult-like following. In 2016, it was named the best farm-to-table restaurant in Massachusetts by Travel + Leisure.  Pay What You Want Day  Typically held on the first day of operations of a new Clover location, Pay What You Want Day allows the area to get to know the food and for the staff to work out their pace. In 2015, Pay What You Want Day was experienced in Central Square with the opening of CloverHFI. In 2016, Clover Food Lab opened the doors to three new locations and one food truck all featuring Pay What You Want Day. All proceeds made during the openings were donated to The Food Project.

It is a story of love during wartime and a country's passion for soccer. The government of North Macedonia considered the film of national interest and funded it with one million euros. The Third Half was selected as the Macedonian entry for Best Foreign Language at the 85th Academy Awards. Plot The film is set in North Macedonia, then part of Yugoslavia and follows the period shortly after the Nazi invasion of the region. In 1941, a young soccer player from Macedonia, Kosta (Sasko Kocev), and a wealthy young Jewish woman, Rebecca (Katarina Ivanovska), fall in love, despite her father's effort to keep them apart. With the war raging around their borders, the Macedonians remain cocooned in their world of patriotic pleasures, primarily concerned about getting the beleaguered Macedonia Football Club on a winning streak. Their manager hires the legendary German-Jewish coach Rudolph Spitz to turn them into champions. But when the Nazi occupation begins and they start deporting Jews, Kosta and his teammates realize that the carefree days of their youth are over. As the Nazis try to sabotage the outcome of the championship game, and Spitz's life is threatened, Kosta and his teammates rise to the challenge to protect their coach, with all of Macedonia cheering them on.Rotten Tomatoes Background The Third Half depicts the history of 7,148 Macedonian Jews who were deported to the gas chambers of Treblinka by the Bulgarian administrative and military authorities, who were cooperating with the Nazi regime. In February 1943, Bulgaria and Germany signed an agreement stipulating the deportation of Bulgarian Jews to camps in Poland. In March 1943, Bulgarian police rounded up the Jews of Thrace and Macedonia at night and placed them in detention camps under extremely harsh conditions. Their property and their houses were confiscated prior to their deportation in late March. Sealed trains transported 11,384 Jews, mainly via the Danube River, to death camps, from which almost none returned. The film was inspired by the true story of the FC Macedonia football team. The film is based also on an interview to the Shoah Foundation on that story given in 1998 by Neta Koen (current name Marija Mladenovska) a Macedonian Holocaust survivor. The Jewish coach of FC Macedonia Ill√©s Spitz who is also a Macedonian Holocaust survivor was rescued by the Bulgarian club's managers.Spas Tashev, The deportation of the Jews from Vardar Macedonia and Aegean region: facts and myths.

He went on to praise the setting, lauding the director for managing to \\"put together all the complicated details of the period and the geopolitical situation\\". Petkoviƒá highlighted Sammel's acting as the strongest and dubbed it \\"the real emotional anchor of the film\\". The film was selected as the Macedonian entry for the Best Foreign Language Oscar at the 85th Academy Awards, but it did not make the final cut for nomination. Controversy Evgeni Kirilov, Andrey Kovatchev and Stanimir Ilchev‚ÄîBulgarian members of the European Parliament‚Äîexpressed outrage over the film and called upon European Commissioner for Enlargement ≈†tefan F√ºle to reprove the Republic of Macedonia over the film.

The four Woiwurung clans collectively claimed the area of the Yarra River and its tributaries. Thus Bebejan's domain was Heidelberg to the source of the Yarra River. Tooterie was a young Ngurai- illam-wurrang woman who was given in marriage to Bebejan, in the early 1820s. Bebejan was head of his clan, a Ngurungaeta, at the time Europeans invaded Kulin territory. He was at the meeting which purportedly gained signatures to Batman's Treaty in 1835 and signed it along with seven other tribal leaders. The contract itself is historically significant as it was the first and only documented time when Europeans negotiated their presence and occupation of Aboriginal lands directly with the traditional owners. Also, present at this meeting with John Batman, was Tooterie and Bebejan's son, Beruk. He would grow up to be one of the most important Kulin leaders in the post-European contact period. When he grew older Beruk, would change his name to William Barak. Bebejan was most probably elevated to tribal leadership after the decimation of the second smallpox plague in 1828. The fact that he was elevated over Billibelleri, his wife's uncle, is testament to the Aboriginal leadership system being merit-based, not lineal descent. Billibelleri readily became number two man (Songman) to his younger nephew and succeeded Bebejan as leader in 1836.

It is the only member of its genus. It can be found in the temperate waters of the Southeast Pacific and Southwest Atlantic, as well as the southern coasts of South America. It can reach a maximum length of 57 cm. Conservation status N. tridentiger has been found only along the Argentinean continental shelf and southern Chile and has not been reported since 1968. Its shallow depth range and medium body size make it very likely to be exposed to extensive trawling activities throughout its range, although it has not been reported in any bycatch surveys. It is listed as data deficient by the IUCN. More research is needed to understand the distribution, population status, habitat, biology, ecology, and impact of potential major threats to this species. Habitat This species is located off the south coast of South America, from northern Argentina (off Buenos Aires) to southern Chile, including the Strait of Magellan and Tierra del Fuego. It is found on muddy bottoms of the continental shelf at depths from 6‚Äì143 m. Reproduction The copulatory organ is absent in this species. The gonads of hagfishes are situated in the peritoneal cavity. The ovary is found in the anterior portion of the gonad, and the testis is found in the posterior part. The animal becomes female if the cranial part of the gonad develops or male if the caudal part undergoes differentiation. If none develops, then the animal becomes sterile. If both anterior and posterior parts develop, then the animal becomes a functional hermaphrodite. However, hermaphroditism being characterised as functional needs to be validated by more reproduction studies (Patzner 1998). Of 11 females (405‚Äì575 mm in total length) examined by Nani and Gneri (1951), those longer than 500 mm were mature. A 507-mm female contained eggs ranging in size from 24.5 x 6.6 to 28 x 8 mm.

The work is lost since at least the 17th century, known only through three surviving fragments and drawing of the full work in Stockholm's Nationalmuseum by a follower of van der Weyden.Campbell (1998), 398‚Äì400 The drawing is sometimes attributed to the Master of the Drapery Studies. The drawing has a loosely sketched background and shows, from left to right: an unidentified bishop saint with mitre and crosier making a blessing gesture; a narrow gap with a few wavy vertical lines suggesting a start at the outline of a further kneeling figure; a barefoot bearded figure in a rough robe identified as Saint John the Baptist; a seated Virgin holding on her lap the Christ-child who leans to the right, looking at a book; and holding the book, a kneeling beardless male identified as John the Evangelist. The drawing stops at the end of John's robe, at about the point on the London panel where Joseph's walking stick meets John and the Magdalen's robes. This suggests that the Magdalen panel was the first to be cut from the larger work. The altarpiece's date is uncertain but believed to be between 1435 and 1438. Van der Weyden was made painter to the city of Brussels in 1435, and it is believed to have been painted after this appointment. The National Gallery gives \\"before 1438\\".\\"Rogier van der Weyden\\". National Gallery, London. Retrieved 24 May 2011. Art historian John Ward notes that the altarpiece was one of van der Weyden's first masterpieces, created early in his career when he was still heavily influenced by Robert Campin. He proposes a c. 1437 date based on similarities to Campin's Werl Altarpiece.Ward (1971), 28 Remnants =Fragments= Head of Saint Joseph (fragment). . Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. This panel is thought to show Saint Joseph, whose body is visible to his upper arm in The Magdalen Reading. Head of a Female Saint (Saint Catherine?) (fragment). . Museu Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon. A possible representation of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, it is of lower quality than the other two known fragments, indicating that it was probably completed by members of van der Weyden's workshop. At an unknown point before 1811, the original altarpiece was broken into at least three pieces,Campbell (1998), 394, 398 possibly due to damage, although the Magdalen fragment is in good condition. The black overpaint was likely added after the early 17th century when Netherlandish painting had fallen from favour and was unfashionable. Campbell believes that after the removal of the background detail \\"it looked sufficiently like a genre piece to hang in a well-known collection of Dutch seventeenth-century paintings\\".Campbell (1998), 405 From the size of three surviving panels in relation to the drawing, it is estimated that the original was at least 1 m high by 1.5 m wide; the bishop and Magdalen seem to clearly mark the horizontal extremities, but the extent of the picture above and below the surviving elements and the drawing cannot be judged. Such a size is comparable with smaller altarpieces of the period. The background was overpainted with a thick layer of black/brown pigment until it was cleaned in 1955; it was only after the layer's removal that it was linked to the upper body and head of Joseph from the Lisbon piece. These two works were not recorded in inventory until 1907, when they appear in the collection of L√©o Lardus in Suresnes, France. The London panel shows much of the clothing of two other figures from the original altarpiece. To the left of the Magdalen is the red robe of what appears to be a kneeling figure. The figure and robe, and less precisely the background, match a kneeling Saint John the Evangelist. Behind the Magdalen is a standing figure in blue and red robes, with linear rosary beads in one handJoseph's beads closely resemble those in the Arnolfini Portrait, which was painted around the same time and is on permanent display in the National Gallery alongside The Magdalen Reading. See Jones, 46, 54 and a walking stick in the other. A panel at the Museu Calouste Gulbenkian in Lisbon shows the head of a figure believed to be the Saint Joseph; the background and clothes match with those of the figure behind the Magdalen on the London panel. Rogier van der Weyden, The Magdalen Reading, 62.2 cm √ó 54.4 cm (24.5 in √ó 21.4 in). Date unknown but possibly 1435‚Äì38. Oil on oak panel. National Gallery, London. There is a further small panel in Lisbon of a female head, richly or royally dressed, which first appeared in 1907 with the Joseph panel when it was recorded in the inventory of Leo Nardus at Suresnes. The figure may represent Saint Catherine of Alexandria, and from both the angle of her cloth and the fact that the river behind her would be parallel to that in the exterior of the London panel it can be assumed that she was kneeling.Campell (2009), 49 In the Stockholm drawing she is omitted, or only traces of her dress shown. The Joseph panel has a sliver of a view through a window to an exterior scene; if the other female is presumed to be kneeling, the trees above the waterway aligns with those in the London panel. Some art historians, including Martin Davies and John Ward,Davies and Ward have published, in 1957 and 1971 respectively, diagrammatic reconstructions of the altarpiece based on evidence available of the time. Campbell is responsible for much of the scholarship since. have been slow to allow the Catherine panel as part of the altarpiece, though it is undoubtedly by van der Weyden or a near-contemporary follower. Evidence against this link includes the fact that the moulding of the window to the left of the Gulbenkian female saint is plain, while that next to Saint Joseph is chamfered. Such an inconsistency in a single van der Weyden work is unusual. The panels are of equal thickness (1.3 cm) and of near-identical size; the Saint Catherine panel measures , the Saint Joseph .Ward (1971), 32 Lorne Campbell thinks that though the Catherine head is \\"obviously less well drawn and less successfully painted than the Magdalen\\", it \\"seems likely\\" that all three fragments came from the same original work; he points out that \\"about half way up the right edge of this fragment [\\"Catherine\\"] is a small triangle of red, outlined by a continuous underdrawn brushstroke ... It is likely that the red is part of the contour of the missing figure of the Baptist\\". The small piece is on the outermost edge of the panel, and only visible when it was removed from the frame. Ward believes the piece corresponds directly with the folds of John's robes. =Drawing= The Stockholm drawing contains a narrow blank gap to the right of the bishop with a few indistinct lines that could represent the lower profile of the kneeling figure of Saint Catherine. Although none of the faces in the three surviving panels match any in the drawing, a 1971 reconstruction by art historian John Ward‚Äîwhich combined all of the works into a composition of a central Virgin and Child flanked by six saints‚Äîis widely accepted. The Stockholm drawing's original location or history before the 19th century is unknown, except that the verso shows a surviving carving of the Virgin and Child attributed to a Brussels workshop from about 1440. This carving is also now in Portugal.Campbell (1998), 398‚Äì400, illustrating the drawing, and with a drawing of a full reconstruction. References ;Notes ;Bibliography * Bolton, Roy (ed).

Cytostatic refers to a cellular component or medicine that inhibits cell growth. Cytostasis is an important prerequisite for structured multicellular organisms. Without regulation of cell growth and division only unorganized heaps of cells would be possible. Chemotherapy of cancer, treatment of skin diseases and treatment of infections are common use cases of cytostatic drugs. Active hygienic products generally contain cytostatic substances. Cytostatic mechanisms and drugs generally occur together with cytotoxic ones. Activators Nitric oxide ‚Äì activated macrophages produce large amounts of nitric oxide (NO), which induces both cytostasis and cytotoxicity to tumor cells both in vitro and in vivo. Nitric oxide-induced cytostasis targets ribonucleotide reductase by rapid and reversible inhibition. However, other studies show there could be other targets that are responsible for producing long-lasting cytostasis in cells. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and lipid A-associated protein ‚Äì studies have demonstrated that LPS and LAP are potent macrophage activators that have been shown to stimulate tumoricidal (cytostatic) activity in vitro. LAP and LPS were shown to stimulate C3H/HeJ macrophages to kill target tumor cells. It was concluded that LAP can deliver at least one of the triggering signals necessary for inducing macrophage activity that leads to cytostasis. Polyunsaturated fatty acid ‚Äì N-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids were found to have a distinct effect on cell growth in certain human urothelial cells.

It was released in theaters on March 9, 2012, four years after it was filmed in August 2008, to largely negative reviews from critics and was a box office flop, grossing only $22 million worldwide against a $40 million budget.  Plot  Jack McCall is a literary agent who uses his \\"gift of gabbing\\" to get various book deals, and he is not afraid to stretch the truth to get them. While he is trying to get a book deal from a New Age self-help guru named Dr. Sinja, the guru sees through his deceit and agrees to the deal, only to later deliver a five-page book. That night, a Bodhi Tree magically appears in his backyard. Dr. Sinja goes to Jack's house and they both discover that for every word that Jack speaks, a leaf will fall off of the tree. When the tree runs out of leaves, the tree will perish, as will Jack. In time, he finds that even written words and gestures towards words count towards his limit; plus anything that happens to the tree will also affect Jack. When Jack tries to cut it down with an axe, an axe wound appears on him. When squirrels climb the tree, it tickles him. When a gardener tries to poison it with DDT, Jack gets high on the fumes and when the gardener tries to water the tree, Jack starts to sweat/perspire profusely. With Jack forced to pick and choose his words, communicating with others becomes difficult and full of misunderstandings. These misunderstandings cost him two book deals, his job, and his wife Caroline. She walks out on him when she thinks his sudden silence is due to his not loving her anymore. When he tries to explain the tree to her, she doesn't believe him. Only Jack's assistant Aaron Weisberger realizes he is telling the truth, and goes to Jack's house to keep track of how many leaves remain. Jack tries to break the curse by being a better person by giving food to the homeless, and donating some of his money to charity, but that plan fails. Jack drinks a lot of alcohol in the night, causing him to sing a lot, thus making the tree lose many of its leaves. Only when Aaron confronts him and tackles him to the ground does Jack stop speaking. With his life falling apart and the tree running out of leaves, Jack confronts Dr. Sinja and asks how to end the curse. The guru tells him to make peace in all of his relationships. With just one branch of leaves left, Jack tries to reconcile with his wife, but she remains hesitant. He visits his mother Annie, who lives in an assisted-living center and has dementia. Annie tells Jack, who she thinks is Jack's late father Raymond, that she wishes Jack would stop being angry at his father for walking out on them when he was a kid. Jack, realizing that this is the relationship that needs the most mending, goes to visit his father's grave. Jack expends the last three leaves of the tree with the words \\"I forgive you\\". With no leaves remaining, Jack suffers a heart attack in a storm and appears to die. Aaron then calls Jack on his cell phone. Jack, who is still alive, answers his phone. Aaron tells him that the tree's leaves have magically reappeared and Jack can now talk freely again. Jack and Caroline get back together, with Jack buying the family-friendly house Caroline asked for earlier, and the tree is in their front yard. He does not get his job back (Aaron was promoted to Jack's old position), but he writes a book about his experience, called A Thousand Words, and gets Aaron to make the deal. Unfortunately for Aaron, his promotion causes him to be like Jack was, thus he gets his own smaller office Bodhi tree.  Cast   Production  A Thousand Words was filmed in August 2008 in Los Angeles, California and was supposed to be released in 2009, but was repeatedly delayed after being caught up in the separation of DreamWorks Pictures from Paramount Pictures and Viacom. During an interview for Fred: The Movie, director Brian Robbins stated that the film would be released in 2011. Reshoots were done on the film early in 2011. The film was then scheduled for a January 2012 release, but after Murphy was announced as the host of the 2012 Oscar ceremony (he later stepped down), the film was given a date of March 23, 2012; this was later pushed to April 20, 2012,\\"'Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters' Delays To 2013 So Jeremy Renner More Of Global Draw\\".

Development Deathwatch, the third Fantasy Flight RPG based in the Warhammer 40,000 universe was officially announced on 26 February 2010.Announcing Deathwatch, a new RPG set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe! Shannon Appelcline commented: \\"Deathwatch (2010), the third Warhammer 40k, finally allowed players the opportunity to play Space Marines ‚Äì Space Marines that kill and kill and kill. Mechanically the game follows the core of Warhammer 40,000 Roleplay, with the biggest addition being 'demeanors' ‚Äì another indie-like addition to the game that allows characters to get bonuses for following their character's core nature. Beyond that, characters were much more powerful than those in either of the previous games, with starting Space Marines being about the same power- level as the most powerful possible Acolytes from Dark Heresy. Some players have expressed concerns over the limited roleplay opportunities of a game so focused on killing but like the other Warhammer 40k Roleplay releases, Deathwatch appeal most to those players looking for the sort of play it allows.\\" References Category:Fantasy Flight Games games Category:Role- playing games based on works Category:Role-playing games introduced in 2010 Category:Science fiction role-playing games Category:Warhammer 40,000 tabletop games ","title":"Deathwatch (role-playing game)"},{"id":"33726859","text":"The cat o' nine tails is a type of multi-tailed whipping device.

The band consists of Victoria Cecilia (vocal, bass, programming, synths), Martin Klingman (vocals, guitar, drums, bass) and formerly David Reiss (guitar, bass).  Kick in Your Heart  Their first album \\" Kick in Your Heart\\" was discovered by Billy Corgan, who brought them to Europe to support his solo tour \\" Future Embrace\\". Following the tour he asked the band to be part of a Smashing Pumpkins tribute album, featuring bands such as Panic! at the Disco, Deftones and The Bravery. In 2007 he again asked the band to support him, this time for the re-formation of Smashing Pumpkins. Love the Virgins Their debut album Love the Virgins, was released in 2007 on UK label Tough Cookie. The single \\"Blue Sky\\" was the winner of \\"Fresh Meat\\" on Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 show. This led to European support slots for Gliss with BRMC and Editors. Gliss released their album \\"Love The Virgins\\" in November 2006, following a UK tour with Orson. At one point, the tour was put in jeopardy when Gliss performed naked and subsequently featured in The Daily Star. The band guest starred in an episode of Nightcalls with pornstar Jesse Jane on Playboy TV, after their infamous UK tour. The track \\"Huh, What?\\" was featured in the MasterCard Priceless commercial \\"Vintage\\". Devotion Implosion Their second album Devotion Implosion was released in 2009 on Cordless/Rykodisc and was produced by the band themselves and mixed by Gareth Jones, (who has worked with Depeche Mode, Liars, Wire, Nick Cave and These New Puritans). The single \\"Gimme the Hit\\" was featured on MTV Subterranean. The band also did an in-studio performance on KCRW's Morning Becomes Eclectic and were featured on Yahoo TV's The New Now following their national tour with The Warlocks, and in-studio performance and interview on Seattle's KEXP. In 2009 the band did an In-studio interview on NME radio in London and Motor FM in Berlin during their tour with British band The Horrors. The band is currently working on their 3rd album to be titled \\"Le Debut\\", which is a complete departure from their previous releases. Most recently Gliss toured the US with Scottish band Glasvegas and shortly thereafter landed a worldwide ad campaign for Calvin Klein's \\"Forbidden Euphoria\\". Langsom Dans Gliss completed recording the follow up to Devotion Implosion in Los Angeles. It was mixed by Michael Patterson (Trent Reznor/NIN, Beck, Ladytron) and mastered by Henrik Jonsson (Lykke Li, The Knife). Experimenting with new sonics, atmospheres and voices, the album was described by KEXP as a collection of dreamy, melancholic pop songs. The album was released on January 22, 2013 via Modern Outsider. Pale Reflections Pale Reflections was released June 26, 2015. Carrying on after the 2013 departure of guitarist David Reiss, the duo of Victoria Cecilia and Martin Klingman released the album titled ‚ÄúPale Reflections.‚Äù Cecilia emerged as the main voice of the band on this 2013 album. Martin Klingman and Victoria Cecilia had been dividing their time between Los Angeles and Berlin, and the record was described as a reflection of the creative underbelly of both cities, with the first single \\"Mirrored\\" diving deep into ethereal electronica. Recorded in Los Angeles and Berlin, the 10-track album is a contrasting blend of dirt and dreamy pop melodies, bringing to mind Beach House and The Kills. After the release, the band had the honor of performing for the Danish royal family along with The Raveonettes.The album was mixed by Victoria Cecilia, and released on the duo‚Äôs own label Kraftw√∂√∂d Musik Fabrik.

They were commonly used in the 1930s but were considered obsolete post-war.  Origins  The friction disk pattern was invented by Truffault, before 1900. These used oiled leather friction surfaces between bronze disks compressed by adjustable conical springs, with the disk pack floating between arms to both chassis and axle, in the distinctive style. From 1904 these were licensed to several makers including Mors, who had first applied shock absorbers to cars, and Hartford in the US. Similar dampers were also applied as steering dampers from this early date.  Construction  signalbox The dampers rely, as their name suggests, on the friction within a stack of disks, clamped tightly together with a spring and clamp bolt. = Andr√© Hartford pattern = The friction disk material was usually a wooden disk between the two faces of the steel arms. As for the development of the clutch and brake shoes, the development of these friction materials was in its infancy. Treated leather had been used for clutches and although it offered good friction behaviour, it was prone to stiction when first moving off and also failed when overheated. Asbestos-based friction materials were sometimes used for racing, in an attempt to keep dampers working correctly even when overheating. The damping force of a friction shock absorber is adjusted with the central pivot and clamping bolt. A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the clamping nut is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting. Installation in rear suspension Andr√© Hartford dampers were made in four sizes, according to vehicle weight and intended use. These were the combination of two disk diameters: and and as either single or multiplate designs. Single dampers had two friction surfaces: a single arm on one side was nested between two arms connected to the other. Multiplate dampers had two and three arms on each side. Dampers were mounted to the chassis and axle through Silentbloc bushes at each end. Silentbloc bushes were another development of the early 1930s, a vulcanised rubber bush bonded into a steel tube. These provided the stiff location that accurate suspension required, but reduced vibration and road noise, compared to earlier cars. Many cars used a different design for front and rear, where the rear arms were rigidly bolted to the chassis, rather than with a swivelling bush. = de Ram pattern = The invention of Georges de Ram, these were a more sophisticated and complex pattern, intended to provide a more consistent damping at high speeds. They were only used on high-end vehicles, notably Bugattis. Early Bugattis had used Bugatti's own pattern of multi-plate damper, similar to the Andr√© Hartford. The de Ram damper used a metallic multi-plate disk stack, with alternate disks splined to either an inside or outside cylindrical carrier, much as for multi- plate clutches of the time. Owing to the weight of the casing, de Ram dampers were always mounted to the chassis, with a single arm to the axle. = Cylindrical friction elements = A similar pattern, with a cylindrical friction element, was used on Mercedes-Benz cars from 1928. The earlier Mercedes had used Hartford pattern. A form using a cylindrical roller bearing with a resilient race was patented in 1930.  Adjustable damping  The damping rate for frictional dampers has less than ideal behaviour for car suspension. An ideal suspension would offer more damping to greater suspension forces, with less damping at low speeds for a smoother ride. Frictional dampers though had a mostly constant rate. This was even greater when stationary, owing to stiction between stationary plates. For larger bumps the damping may even be reduced. This is particularly a problem for fast driving, when repeated high forces may cause the friction plates to heat up and lose their efficiency. Motor racing in the 1930s was often an amateur affair, where sports cars would be driven to racetracks such as Brooklands, adjusted in the paddock to their racing trim and then raced. It was normal to re-adjust the damping between \\"road\\" and \\"race\\" settings. The need for adjustable damping was so great that it was even useful to provide a means of adjusting this whilst driving. This was a feature only used on luxury cars, often larger cars that might need to set their suspension for varying numbers of passengers. Stiffness could be increased between \\"town\\" and a stiffer setting for the faster open road. These dampers were best known under the Telecontrol brand name. A hydraulic control, with an inflatable rubber bag in the disk pack, could be used to increase the clamping force and thus their damping stiffness. One of the major reasons for the decline of frictional dampers post-war, in favour of hydraulic lever arms, was the hydraulic damper's better change of rate with suspension amplitude. Hydraulic dampers had a resistance that inherently increased with velocity of suspension movement, a far more useful behaviour. This useful inherent behaviour meant that manual adjustment was far less necessary, certainly not whilst driving.  Motorcycle use  1933 Velocette motorcycle front fork Motorcycles of the same period, through to the 1950s, that used girder forks also used friction disk shock absorbers. These were often provided with a large handwheel, so that they could be adjusted easily during a ride, or even whilst in motion.  Signalboxes  Stafford, with Hartford shock absorbers at the rear. Hartford shock absorbers were also used within the manual lever frames of some UK signalboxes. They were used to prevent shock loads if the levers were allowed to slam back in the frame under the weight of the counterweights.

The Serer who have migrated from Tekrur to join their distant Serer relatives created a southward migration for Mandinka migrants. Godfrey Mwakikagile proposed that the Mandinkas were either defeated in battle or incorporated into Serer society.Mwakikagile, Godfrey, \\"Ethnic Diversity and Integration in the Gambia\\", p225 The Serers ruled over the Wolof kingdom of Jolof.

Migration from Kabuu to Sine The actual foundation of the Kingdom of Sine is unclear, but in the late 14th century Mandinka migrants entered the area. They were led by a matrilineal clan known as the Gelwaar.

In a professional career which spanned nearly twenty years, he represented mainly Real Sociedad, amassing official totals of 411 games and 41 goals in 14 seasons. Loren also played for Athletic Bilbao, being the most expensive Spanish player at the time of his transfer. Club career =Real Sociedad= Born in Mambrillas de Lara, Province of Burgos, Loren joined Real Sociedad from amateurs Tolosa CF also in the Basque Country. On 9 September 1984, one month shy of his 18th birthday, he made his first-team ‚Äì and La Liga ‚Äì debut, in a 0‚Äì1 home loss against CD M√°laga, as a central defender, the position in which he started his career; this was due to a strike by the professional footballers in the country, with most teams having to resort to fielding youth players. After only four league games in his first two seasons combined, Loren became an undisputed starter for the side from Gipuzkoa, helping them to the 1987 Copa del Rey ‚Äì he did not play in the final against Atl√©tico Madrid due to injury, however. In the 1987‚Äì88 campaign, by now reinvented as a striker by Welsh manager John Toshack, he scored a career-best 11 games in 36 games as the club finished second to Real Madrid. =Athletic / Burgos= In the summer of 1989, Loren signed for Real Sociedad's local rivals Athletic Bilbao, who paid 300 million pesetas for his services, a record for a national player. He later confessed that, had Athletic not paid the full extent of his clause, he would not have made the move, which would be the first of several controversial transfer negotiations between the two clubs. Loren made his official debut for the Lions on 2 September 1989, playing the full 90 minutes in a 1‚Äì0 home win against his former team. He underperformed overall during his two-season stint, only netting four times in his second year. Loren then signed for Real Burgos CF in his native region, who rose from the ashes of Burgos CF. He scored seven goals in his first season to help to a best ever ninth-place finish in the top level, being relegated in the following campaign. =Return to Real Sociedad= In the 1993 off-season, 26-year-old Loren returned to Real Sociedad. On 13 August he scored the first goal in the new Anoeta Stadium, in a friendly with Real Madrid. Again under Toshack he returned to the stopper position, often partnering another youth graduate, Jos√© Antonio Pikabea, during his second spell, and never appearing in less than 27 league games in the following seven seasons. After only eight games in 2001‚Äì02, Loren retired from playing football at almost 36, having appeared in 482 top division games over the course of 18 seasons (54 goals). He remained with Real Sociedad in the following years as the club's director of football, a position he took up in 2009, until March 2018.

To its west and south, it borders upon the Vyshhorod and Brovary Raions of the Kiev Oblast. Its total area constitutes , constituting 8.3 percent of the total area. History As part of a full-scale administrative reorganization of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic, the Oster Raion was created on March 7, 1923, as an administrative entity of the Nizhyn Okruha; later in July of that year, the Kozelets Raion was also created. During the Holodomor, 508 people died throughout 36 settlements in the Kozelets Raion. Administrative divisions The Kozelets Raion is divided in a way that follows the general administrative scheme in Ukraine. Local government is also organized along a similar scheme nationwide. Consequently, raions are subdivided into councils, which are the prime level of administrative division in the country. Each of the raion's urban localities administer their own councils, often containing a few other villages within its jurisdiction. However, only a handful of rural localities are organized into councils, which also may contain a few villages within its jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Kozelets Raion is divided into: * 1 city council‚Äîmade up of the city of Oster * 2 settlement councils‚Äîmade up of the urban-type settlements of Desna and Kozelets (administrative center) * 40 village councils Overall, the raion has a total of 111 populated localities, consisting of one city, two urban-type settlements, 106 villages, and 2 rural settlements.

The tower can be used as an observation tower. It was built in 1914/15.  Location  The tower is located in the Mansfeld Land region on the edge of the Harz/Saxony-Anhalt Nature Park. It stands on the Stahlsberg, a wooded hill ridge on the northeastern flank of the Harz Mountains in central Germany. The Stahlsberg rises immediately south of Opperode through which the Sauerbach stream flows. The tower lies within the borough of Ballenstedt.  History  On the 100th anniversary of the Battle of Leipzig in 1913, Ballenstedt's lord mayor, Wendt, proposed the erection of a Bismarck tower. The tower committee that was formed to take this forward, selected the Stahlsberg hill near Opperode as the location and Professor Wilhelm Kreis as the architect. He decided on a tower that was extremely similar to his award-winning G√∂tterd√§mmerung design. The Bismarck Tower was made of limestone and granite from the nearby Harz Mountains. The laying of the foundation stone was celebrated on 14 June 1914, just before the outbreak of the First World War. During the war, work ground to a halt and it was not taken up again until the 1930s. From 1930 to early 1931 the tower was finished under the direction of the Ballenstedt branch of the Harz Club who went for a simpler shape. For example, they left out the planned brazier (Feuerschale) on the observation platform. On 20 May 1931 the tower was inaugurated in a modest ceremony. After the Second World War and during East German times the tower fell into ruins. In 1994/95, after the end of the Cold War, the tower was restored and it re-opened on 1 July 1995. The tower is about 11 metres high (it was originally planned to be 16.50 metres high). An inner staircase with 57 steps leads to a viewing platform at an elevation of around .  Walking and access  The Bismarck Tower is not permanently open as an observation tower. A key to the entrance door may, for example, be obtained from the tourist office in Ballenstedt (Touristik-Information Ballenstedt). From the viewing platform there are views of the Harz Foreland, Ballenstedt and Opperode. The tower is No. 199 in the system of checkpoints in the Harzer Wandernadel hiking network.

The expected enrollment of ACP- Erie is 486 students. History The first college preparatory junior high/high school program in the Chandler Unified School District was Hamilton Prep, opened in 2007. Hamilton Prep served grades 7 through 12 and operated using space rented from Chandler Christian Church (though the church did not have any influence on policy or curriculum). Hamilton Prep offered its own junior high sports teams, but high school athletics was routed through the bigger Hamilton High School, with which it also shared colors and mascot. In 2010, Chandler Traditional Junior High School opened on the site home to the original Chandler Junior High School (closed 1988 and later used by Chandler High School). It was an extension of the district's Chandler Traditional Academy (CTA) program. For the 2011-12 school year, the focus was shifted to college prep and the name changed to the current Arizona College Prep. The junior high school is known as the ACP Oakland Campus. At the same time, the district looked to upgrade the Hamilton Prep high school program to a permanent location that could serve more students. Conversion Erie Elementary School, a school with declining enrollment in an older part of Chandler, was selected for the renovations to begin to convert the site into a high school. The school continued operations during the 2011-12 school year with portions cordoned off to allow construction.http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/2012/03/30/20120330erie- elementary-transition-proceeds.html $8.6 million was spent on renovations,http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/2012/04/10/20120410hamilton- prep-primps-st-only-prom.html $3.3 million more than anticipated due to an expanded scope of the project and due to higher than budgeted costs for utility work.http://www.azcentral.com/community/chandler/articles/2012/04/04/20120404erie- renovation-tops-estimate-by-mil.html Arizona College Prep has its own athletics program instead of feeding into Hamilton. School colors are purple, black, and silver; the mascot is the Knights. For the 2011-12 school year, the renamed ACP Oakland Campus retained the Chandler Traditional Junior High colors (royal blue and gold) and mascot (Mustangs); this image was replaced with the new Knights.

While NBC did re-air the special twice following its initial airing, it has rarely been seen since. The film is in the collection of the Paley Center for Media, which has only held a very small number of screenings of the feature. It was created by Bill Cosby and animator Ken Mundie (best known for the opening credit sequences of Rawhide and The Wild Wild West). It was based on Cosby's stand-up routines, which were based on his childhood. It would later inspire the long-running 1972 animated series Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids. A second special, Weird Harold, aired on May 4, 1973. The special has a very different style from the later series. Due to time and a tight budget, the animators had to draw directly onto cels with grease pencils and actual images of Philadelphia were used for backgrounds.http://www.tvparty.com/satfat.html The music was provided by Herbie Hancock, who later used some of the music he composed on his album Fat Albert Rotunda.

Among the achievements is the expansion of infrastructure to keep pace with population growth, in particular through the construction of the Thika Dam and associated water treatment plant and pipelines during the 1990s; the transformation of the municipal water department into an autonomous utility in 2003; and the more recent reduction of water losses ‚Äì technically called non-revenue water ‚Äì from 50 to 40%. Challenges include poor quality and intermittent water supply (only 40% of those with house connections receive water continuously), the loss of storage capacity in reservoirs behind dams through siltation accelerated by erosion in the Aberdare Range, lack of access to adequate sanitation in slums where half the population of the city lives, blockages of sewers resulting in overflows, and unused capacity in the city's largest wastewater treatment plant in Dandora. Another problem is political infighting and corruption, leading to the firing of the entire Board of the Nairobi Water Company in 2009. History The history of water supply to Nairobi since the city was founded as a rail outpost in 1899 has been to a large extent a history of tapping ever more distant water sources to supply a rapidly expanding city with sufficient water. Other challenges faced included the reduction of water distribution losses, reaching the poor in slums, expanding sewerage and wastewater treatment, and strengthening the Nairobi water utility. =Supply expansion= The source of the first piped water supply system of Nairobi were the Kikuyu springs and the Kabete treatment plant developed in 1906. This was followed by the Ruiru dam in 1936 and the Sasumua Dam on the Chania River in 1945, both located in the Aberdare Range north of Nairobi, as well as local deep wells. In the 1970s these sources were not any more sufficient to supply the growing city during the dry season and financing for a new and larger dam, the Thika Dam, was mobilised to alleviate growing water shortages. The dam and the associated pipeline and water treatment plant were financed by the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the European Investment Bank and the Japanese OECF. Gross water availability increased from 165 litres per capita and day in 1976 to 200 in 1995.World Bank Operations Evaluation Department:\\"Kenya: Development of Housing, Water Supply, and Sanitation in Nairobi,\\" by Tauno Skytta and Jean-Francois Landeau. Report No. 15586, April 1996. When the Thika dam came on stream the last wellfield used by the city for piped water supply was closed down so that the city began to rely exclusively on surface water. =Water loss reduction= In parallel with the tapping of new water sources, efforts were undertaken to reduce water distribution losses by introducing a metered zoning system. According to a World Bank evaluation the system allowed to \\"significantly reduce water losses\\". In 1998 non-revenue water, which includes physical losses as well as administrative losses such as illegal water use and undermetering, had thus been reduced to 27‚Äì30%.African Development Bank:Project Completion Report:Third Nairobi Water Supply Project, July 1998, p. 16 However, water losses subsequently must have increased again, because in 2010 the Nairobi Water and Sewer Company declared that it had successfully achieved a reduction of non-revenue water from 50 to 40%. The regulatory agency WASREB estimated non-revenue water in Nairobi at 40% in 2008/09 and at 42% in 2009/10. =Water kiosks in slums= Kibera slum in Nairobi is supplied with drinking water through kiosks. A particular challenge in Nairobi has been and still is how to provide sufficient and affordable water to half its population living in slums. Since the 1970s slum residents with piped water connections built water kiosks where they resell water to other residents in buckets. The number of water kiosks in slums increased from about 150 in 1978 to nearly 1,500 in 1994. The municipal water department recommended a resale price, but could not enforce it so that the poorest end up paying much more than those fortunate enough to have a tap in their house. =Sewerage and wastewater treatment= Another challenge is sanitation. A sewer system for the central district was built in the late colonial period and the first wastewater treatment plant was completed at Kariobangi just east of the city in 1961, shortly before independence. A second wastewater treatment plant was commissioned in 1980 in Dandora further East and further downstream on the Nairobi River. In 1994 a substantial expansion of the plant was completed, making it the largest plant of its kind ‚Äì a stabilization pond plant ‚Äì in Africa. In parallel, an effort was made to expand the sewerage system. With the new infrastructure the discharge of liquid waste in open drains declined considerably and for a period between 1987 and 1995 the water quality of the Nairobi River improved. However, the discharge of untreated wastewater in non-sewered areas continued. Because of inadequate garbage collection and poor maintenance sewers became clogged and overflowed, so that the benefits of the sewerage were less than expected. Furthermore, the Kariobangi plant was poorly maintained and stopped functioning so that the wastewater bypassed it and was discharged without treatment to the Nairobi river. =Sector reforms: From city department to utility= Tipping collected sewerage into the local river at the Korogocho slum. Another challenge was of an institutional nature: The Water and Sewer Department (WSD) of the city had difficulties retaining qualified staff because of its salary structure that made it uncompetitive compared to the private sector and other parastatals. For example, out of 57 staff sent for training in 1996‚Äì97, one third had left by 1998. The morale of those who remained was said to be low. Furthermore, cost recovery was low and declining. For political reasons tariffs were increased less than the inflation rate, so that real tariff levels declined between 1988 and 1998. Furthermore, the devaluation of the Kenyan Shilling in the early 1990s led to high losses because the utility was indebted in foreign currency. The sustainable operation and maintenance of the water and sanitation infrastructure was thus in jeopardy because of lack of financial resources.African Development Bank:Project Completion Report:Third Nairobi Water Supply Project, July 1998, p. 12-13 and p. 18 In 2002 the government approved a major sector reform that, among other things, resulted in the transformation of the city water and sewer department into a legally and financially autonomous utility called the Nairobi City Water & Sewerage Company in 2003. Physical assets were transferred to an Asset Holding Company, the Athi Water Services Board, which signed a performance contract with the new operating utility. The reform was designed to allow utilities to offer higher salaries to qualified staff, to insulate decisions about tariff adjustments from political interference, to improve the financial viability of utilities and to ultimately improve service quality. =2009 drought= In 2009 the dry season was longer than usual and the reservoir of the Thika Dam, which has a storage capacity of 70m cubic metres, held only 26m cubic metres of water at the height of the drought. Environmentalists attributed the low water levels not only to the failed rains, but also to the destruction of forests in the Aberdare Range BBC:Nairobi water 'stolen for farms', 10 July 2009, Retrieved 6 November 2011 Erosion reduces the storage capacity of the reservoir and water quality has been reduced by pesticide runoff. The Nairobi water utility drilled emergency wells during the drought and connected them to the piped network, relying again on groundwater about a decade after the utility had closed down its last wellfield. =2009 sacking of the Nairobi Water Company Board= The drought coincided with the campaign for the Nairobi mayoral election, thus triggering a political crisis. In July 2009 the Nairobi City Council sacked the entire Board of the Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company for \\"malpractices\\". This was in the wake of the publication of a report by Transparency International- Kenya and the Kenyan NGO Maji Na Ufanisi (Water and Development). The report had found cases of bribery for illegal connections, tampering with meter readings and diversion of water from domestic users to industries in five cities, with the highest incidence of bribery in Nairobi. However, according to a report by NTV (Kenya) \\"some of the failures blamed on the Board can be traced to members of the City Council\\". The elections were won by incumbent mayor Geoffrey Majiwa. However, he had to step down himself a year later because of corruption allegations.Daily Nation, 28 October 2010: Nairobi mayor leaves office over cemetery scandal =Plans for further supply expansion= In August 2010 the Athi Water Services Board presented a 24-year, US$1 billion master plan to more than double surface water supply to Nairobi by delivering an additional 750,000 m3 of water from the Irati, Gikigie, Maragua and other rivers north of Nairobi. Financing is expected from the French Development Agency and the World Bank.Mbugua Njoroge: 1 USD billion Master Plan to Tap City‚Äôs Water Woes, Retrieved 6 November 2011 Access Of Nairobi's 3.14 million inhabitants at night, a number that swells to about 5 million during the day, only about 50 per cent have direct access to piped water. The rest obtain water from kiosks, vendors, illegal connections or from wells. Only about 40 per cent of those with access to piped water receive water 24 hours per day. On average, residents of Nairobi received water for only 11 hours per day in 2009/10, a level deemed unacceptable by the Water Sector Regulatory Board. Water quality The Nairobi water utility NCWSC says it has stringent water quality monitoring programs to ensure the water they supply the city is safe for drinking. However, due to high leakage in the network and intermittent supply treated water is sometimes recontaminated before it reaches the tap. According to the Water Sector Regulatory Board, in 2009/10 only 76% of drinking water samples complied with standards for bacteriological quality, a level deemed unacceptable by the regulator. This was the case despite a high level of chlorination that was deemed acceptable by the regulator with 91% of samples complying with the norms for residual chlorine. Also, sometimes water is contaminated because of pipe bursts. For instance, over 10 fatalities from water borne diseases were experienced in the slum Mukuru kwa Njenga in 2009. Those who can afford it boil or filter water before drinking it, or buy bottled water. Those who cannot afford this are forced to take their chances with tap water. Water sources Nairobi residents receive water through the piped network and pump water from their own deep wells. Water supply from both sources is about 570,000 m3/day. If one takes into account that the population of Nairobi swells to 5 million during daytime, this corresponds to less than 120 litre per capita per day before distribution losses. However, water is not equally distributed: Wealthier users with access to piped water use much more than average, while those without access to piped water receive much less. Half of Nairobi‚Äôs population lives in slums, but they consume only 34,500 m3/day, corresponding to less than 20 litre per capita per day. The heavily polluted and relatively small Nairobi River that flows through the city is not used for drinking water supply. =Surface water= The Nairobi water utility relies almost exclusively on surface water to satisfy the growing city's water needs. Surface water supply for Nairobi stood at 484,500 m3/day in 2010. Reservoirs have sufficient storage to supply the city during a normal dry season, but during extended droughts water supply can be lower than average. The above figure is for 99% supply reliability. At 90% reliability available water supply is higher at a total of 577,000 m3/day.African Development Bank:Project Completion Report:Third Nairobi Water Supply Project, July 1998, p. 9 However, storage capacity in reservoirs is gradually reduced through sedimentation. The Nairobi utility receives 94% of its water from the Tana River basin north of the city through three reservoirs: the Sasumua Dam on the Chania River, the Thika Dam and the Chania-B Dam. The Thika Dam is the largest, supplying 225,000 m3/day. Water from the reservoirs is treated in two treatment plants, including the largest one in Ngethu. The remaining 6% comes from local sources: the Kikuyu Springs and the Ruiru Dam, both located in the Athi River Basin and whose water is treated in two smaller treatment plants.Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company:Map of Nairobi water sources The spillway of the Sasumua Dam has been badly damaged during the 2003 El Nino floods. The spillway was rehabilitated between 2009 and 2011 with financing from the French Development Agency at a cost of 65m Euro. =Groundwater= Groundwater supplies an additional 85.000 m3 per day or more from an estimated 3000 boreholes, up from an estimated 2250 boreholes in 2001. The groundwater table has declined; in one well it declined by 40 meters between 1958 and 1996. The average depth of new wells in 2001 was 238 meters. In that year 97 new wells were drilled because of a drought. Most wells are operated by industrial enterprises, hotels, farms for flower production in greenhouses, and private houses in parts of the city that receive only intermittent supply (e.g. Langata and Karen). Groundwater is also used to irrigate gardens and to supply tankers that resell the water. Many private well owners are also connected to the mains water supply network and use groundwater as a back-up supply. Natural groundwater quality is good. There are few data on whether the aquifer has been polluted or not. At the height of another drought in 2008/2009, Athi Water Services Board drilled over 40 emergency boreholes in various parts of the city and connected them to the distribution network. Sewerage and waste water treatment The existing sewer network of a total length of about 163 km only covers an area of about 208 km2,Athi Water Services Board:Projects, 6 November 2011 which is less than 30% of the 696 km2 area of the city. It is unclear what share of the population is connected to the sewerage system: Estimates vary from 10 to 48%. There are two wastewater treatment plants in Nairobi: The Dandora stabilisation ponds treat industrial and domestic sewage and have a design capacity of 80,000 cubic meters per day. They constitute the largest pond system in Africa, but as of 1996 only half its capacity has been used.H.W. Pearson, S.T. Avery, S.W. Mills, P. Njaggah and P. Odiambo Performance of the phase II Dandora waste stabilisation ponds: The case for anaerobic ponds, Water Science and Technology Volume 33, Issue 7, 1996, Pages 91‚Äì98. Retrieved 6 November 2011 The Kariobangi wastewater treatment plant has a capacity of 32,000 m3 per day and uses the trickling filter technology. The effluent from both plants is discharged into the Nairobi River. Institutions The responsibility for water supply and sewerage in Nairobi is shared between an asset holding company, Athi Water Services Board (AWSB), and an operating company, the Nairobi City Water and Sewer Company that operates under contract with the AWSB. 10 other Water Service Providers (WSPs) operate under the AWSB in localities near Nairobi that are located outside of Nairobi Province. Service standards are set and monitored by a national water regulatory agency called the Water Services Regulatory Board (WASREB). The Athi Water Services Board is under the authority of the Ministry of Water and Irrigation and covers its costs through a Regulatory Levy collected from the Water Service Providers.Athi Water Services Board Retrieved 6 November 2011 The Minister of Water and Irrigation, a position held by Charity Ngilu since 2008, appoints the Board of AWSB. The 8-member supervisory Board is chaired by Reuben Ndolo, a member of parliament from the Orange Democratic Movement of Prime Minister Raila Odinga. Since July 2011 the CEO is Malakwen Milgo, an engineer who has previously worked for the German technical advisory agency GTZ. The company is ISO 9001 certified. Water and sewer services in Nairobi city are provided by the Nairobi City Water & Sewerage Company Ltd. The Company is owned by the City and has a supervisory Board of 12 Directors from the private sector, professional associations, NGOs and the City Council. The County Government appointed a new Board in March 2014 to replace the one that was chaired by Peter Kuguru. The new chairman is Mr. Raphael Nzomo. However, an activist Mr. Okiya Omtata went to court and had this new Board declared illegal since the prerequisite requirements of advertisement was not met by the county government of Nairobi. The day-to-day business of the company is run by a managing director. Managing Director Francis Mugo was retired by the Board of NCWSC in October 2011 and Eng. Philip Gichuki, a former manager of Tana Water Services Board appointed substantive MD on 18 February 2012. The politicisation of the company caused divisions among staff, leading to offices being deserted. Previously AWSB had attempted to control NWC's finances through a new Service Provision Agreement (SPA) that foresaw a new account to which AWSB would have been a signatory. The company is ISO 9001 certified.Nairobi Water Company profile, Retrieved 6 November 2011 The 10 other WSPs under contract with the Athi Water Services Board operate water and, in some cases, sewer systems in towns around Nairobi. They are the Kiambu Water & Sewerage Company, the Gatundu South Water & Sanitation Company, the Karimenu Community Water & Sanitation Company, the Gatanga Community Water Project, the Limuru Water & Sewerage Company, the Kikuyu Water Company, the Ruiru Juja Water & Sewerage Company, the Kitisuru Water Company, the Runda Water & Sewerage Company and the Githunguri Water and Sanitation Company. Some of them are private, such as Runda Water and Sewerage Company that provides piped water to the Executive Residential Housing Estate of Old Runda since 1975.Runda Estate Association website Retrieved 6 November 2011 Water pricing, billing and cost recovery Those fortunate enough to have access to piped water pay relatively low water tariffs, while slum residents typically have to rely on much more expensive water sold in cans through water kiosks. Water tariffs are identical for all water service providers under contract with the Athi Water Service Board. Tariff increases are approved by WASREB. In June 2009 a tariff increase took effect, bringing residential and commercial tariffs to the following level: * Between 0 and 10m3: 18.71 KSh/m3 (US$0.18/m3), * Between 11 and 30m3: 28.07KSh/m3 (US$0.28/m3), * Between 31 and 60m3: 42.89KSh/m3 (US$0.43/m3). If there is a sewer connection, there is a sewer surcharge of 75%. Water kiosks in slums are billed at a lower rate of 10 shillings/m3 (US$0.10/m3) independently of consumption, if the kiosk owners are properly registered. Nevertheless, slum residents end up paying much more for water. A 20-litre jerry can of water in a slum typically sells for 2 Kenyan shillings, corresponding to 100 shillings per m3 (US$1). This is double the recommended price of 1 shilling (50 shillings per m3) and more than five times the water tariff in the lowest consumption bracket (19 shillings per m3). During the 2009 drought prices in slums rose to 5 and even 10 Kenyan shillings, corresponding to 250 to 500 KSh per m3 (US$2.50‚Äì5.00), which is higher than water tariffs in some European countries. Fraudulent billing remains a challenge. While some parts of the city are so dangerous that meter readers do not venture to enter them, in other cases men posing as employees of the water company threaten to disconnect customers unless they pay them. To combat this type of fraud, the water company has purchased clearly marked motorcycles that will replace the Nissan cars that were previously used by meter readers and disconnection crews. This video includes interviews with Philip Gichuki, managing director of Nairobi Water Company and Reuben Ndolo, Chairman of Athi Water Services Board. However, since 2010 Nairobi Water Company customers can also pay their bills via mobile phone through the money transfer service M-PESA. According to the Water Sector Regulatory Board, collection efficiency ‚Äì the share of bills that were paid ‚Äì was not acceptable at only 75% in 2009/10. Despite the low collection efficiency NWC covered 126% of its operation and maintenance costs, which is within the range considered acceptable by the regulator. 87% of connections were metered, a ratio that was also judged not acceptable by the regulator. Water supply to slums A lack of basic sanitation in the Kibera slum, Nairobi. In Kibera and other slums of Nairobi water is supplied through water kiosks. 98% of kiosks are privately owned and the owners financed the construction of the kiosks and the pipes to the water mains. Only 2% were operated by community-based organisations or NGOs. Water is supplied by the Nairobi utility, but is often not paid for by the kiosk owners. Although two-thirds of the kiosks have water reservoirs, their capacity is insufficient and often water is not available due to supply interruptions.Suzanne Snell:Water and sanitation for the urban poor.Small- Scale Providers:Typology and Profiles, 1998, UNDP-World Bank Water and Sanitation Program, p.19-20 A higher percentage of kiosk users reports scarcity than households with mains connections, suggesting that in times of scarcity kiosks are less likely to receive water than domestic connections.Citizens' Report Card on urban water, sanitation and solid waste services in Kenya, 2007 6 November 2011 According to residents, \\"water is highly contaminated, smells, has a weird color and has particles inside\\", \\"because old, rusty pipes often break and water is polluted by the open drainage lines and sewage lines which run parallel to the water network\\". In 2003, when the new water law was passed, the government threatened to shut down kiosks that were not properly registered, saying that they overcharged the poor and did not pay their bills to the city. As a result, in 2004 kiosk owners formed an association called Maji Bora Kibera (MBK) ‚Äì the Swahili translation of 'better water services for Kibera'. They engaged in a dialogue with the government, paid their arrears, committed not to pay bribes and were trained on courtesy and customer relations.Water and Sanitation Program of the World Bank:Rogues No More? Water Kiosk Operators Achieve Credibility in Kibera, June 2005, p. 9-11 One of the reasons for high water prices charged by kiosks was, and perhaps still is, that kiosk owners have to pay bribes to officials, both to allow the initial construction and to operate the kiosks. To register a water connection the utility requires the applicant's plot number, address details, a landlord's certification as a proof of residence, and a certificate of employment. The kiosk operators often do not have these documents and thus pay bribes. Another reason for high prices is that unregistered kiosk owners are not charged at the preferential bulk sale rate, but rather at the increasing-block rate for residential customers. A 1997 study showed that there is substantial competition between nearby water kiosks. Profits of kiosk owners were low and high prices were caused primarily by high costs. The membership in Maji Bora Kibera dropped from the initial 1500 kiosk owners to only 195 who had paid their membership dues in early 2005. Six years later, the problems had apparently not been resolved. According to statements made at community meetings in the slums of Kibera and Mathare in September 2011, so-called cartels still try to monopolise water supply, resorting even to violence to keep prices high. Allegedly, local politicians back these cartels. The cartels ‚Äúcreate artificial water shortages and, through vandalism and threats, hike up prices‚Äù.Water Hackathon: Water Problems in Nairobi, Retrieved 6 November 2011 External co-operation The World Bank, the French Development Agency and the African Development Bank finance investments in water supply and sanitation in Nairobi.

Examples of the software using the mode are operating systems and Internet Explorer. Operating systems A compatibility mode in an operating system is a software mechanism in which a computer's operating system emulates an older processor, operating system, and/or hardware platform in order to allow older software to remain compatible with the computer's newer hardware or software. This differs from a full- fledged emulator in that an emulator typically creates a virtual hardware architecture on the host system, rather than simply translating the older system's function calls into calls that the host system can understand. Examples include Classic Mode in Mac OS X and Windows 2000's / Windows XP's / Windows Vista's / Windows 7's / Windows 8's / Windows 8.1's / Windows 10's compatibility mode, which both allow applications designed for older versions of the operating system to run. Other examples include Wine to run Windows programs on Linux / OS X and Mono to run .NET programs on various Unix-like systems. Internet Explorer \\"Compatibility View\\" is a compatibility mode feature of the web browser Internet Explorer in version 8 and later. When active, Compatibility View forces IE to display the webpage in Quirks mode as if the page were being viewed in IE7. When compatibility view is not activated, IE is said to be running in native mode. In IE11, a user can turn on compatibility mode for a web site by clicking the Gears icon and clicking Compatibility View Settings. = IE8+ = Internet Explorer 8 was promoted by Microsoft as having stricter adherence to W3C described web standards than Internet Explorer 7. As a result, as in every IE version before it, some percentage of web pages coded to the behavior of the older versions would break in IE8. This would have been a repetition of the situation with IE7 which, while having fixed bugs from IE6, broke pages that used the IE6-specific hacks to work around its non-compliance. This was especially a problem for offline HTML documents, which may not be updatable (e.g. stored on a read-only medium, such as a CD-ROM or DVD-ROM). To avoid this situation, IE8 implemented a form of version targeting whereby a page could be authored to a specific version of a browser using the \`X-UA-Compatible\` declaration either as a meta element or in the HTTP headers. In order to maintain backwards compatibility, sites can opt into IE7-like handling of content by inserting a specially created meta element into the web page that triggers compatibility mode in the browser, using:MSDN \\"What's New in Internet Explorer 8\\" . A newer version of the browser than the page was coded for would emulate the behavior of the older version, so that the assumptions the page made about the browser's behavior hold true. Microsoft proposed that a page with a doctype that triggers standards mode (or almost standards mode) in IE7 would, by default, trigger IE7-like behavior, called \\"standards mode\\" (now called \\"strict mode\\") in IE8 and future versions of IE. The new features of IE8 are enabled to trigger what Microsoft called the \\"IE8 standards mode\\" (now called \\"standards mode\\"). Doctypes that trigger quirks mode in IE7 will continue to do so in IE8. Peter Bright of Ars Technica claimed that the idea of using a meta tag to pick a specific rendering mode fundamentally misses the point of standards-based development but positioned the issue as one of idealism versus pragmatism in web development, noting that not all of the Web is maintained, and that \\"demanding that web developers update sites to ensure they continue to work properly in any future browser version is probably too much to ask.\\" The result for IE 8 Beta 1 was that it could render three modes: \\"Quirks,\\" \\"Strict,\\" and \\"Standard.\\" When there is an old DOCTYPE or when there is no DOCTYPE, IE renders it like IE5 would (quirks mode). When a special meta element or its corresponding HTTP header is included in a web page, IE8 will render that page like IE7 would (strict mode). Otherwise, IE8 renders pages with its own engine (standard mode). Users can switch between the three modes with a few clicks. The release of Internet Explorer 8 Beta 1 revealed that many web sites do not work in this new standards mode. Microsoft maintains a list of websites that have been reported to have problems in IE8's standards mode, known as the compatibility view list. When a user enables this list IE8 will render the websites in the list using its compatibility view mode. The list is occasionally updated to add newly reported problematic websites, as well as to remove websites whose owners have requested removal. The Internet Explorer team also tests the websites on the list for compatibility issues and removes those where none are found.

He was also Rector of Stoke Newington and of St Benet, Gracechurch. For a long time, he was secretary to the Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge. A street in Islington bears his name. Life The son of John Gaskin, a leather-seller (1710‚Äì1766), and of Mabel his wife (1707‚Äì1791), he was born at Newington Green, London. He was educated at a classical school in Woodford, Essex, and went to Trinity College, Oxford, in 1771. He proceeded B.A. in 1775, M.A. in 1778, and D.D. in 1788. He was ordained deacon in 1774, when he became curate of St Vedast, Foster Lane. He was then appointed to fill the vacant office of lecturer in the parish of Islington, a post which he occupied for forty-six years. In 1778 he accepted the curacy of the parish of Stoke Newington. His first preferment was the rectory of Sutton and Mepal in the Isle of Ely. This, however, in 1791 he exchanged for the living of St Benet Gracechurch, in order to be on hand for fulfilling his duties as secretary to the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge. He was employed on behalf by the society to visit and report on the mission schools and churches of the Scilly Islands. He was a supporter of the Episcopal Church of Scotland and was selected as a member of the English committee for the obtaining of a bill known as An Act for granting Relief to Pastors and Ministers and Lay Persons of the Episcopal Communion in Scotland. In 1797 he was further promoted to the rectory of Stoke Newington. On attaining his seventy-second year he was presented (25 May 1822) to a vacant stall in Ely Cathedral, was able to resign his secretaryship, and ultimately his post as lecturer of Islington. He then took a prominent position in assisting church institutions in the western United States, and in 1823 acted as trustee of the funds collected for the infant church of Ohio. He died on 29 June 1829, from a rapid succession of epileptic fits. Gaskin was married in early life to Elizabeth Broughton, daughter of the Rev. Thomas Broughton, rector of Allhallows, Lombard Street, and of Wotton, Surrey. Works Gaskin's published works included sermons. He compiled and revised in 1798 the writings of Richard Southgate, who bequeathed him all his manuscripts. In 1821 he published an edition of sermons written by the American bishop Theodore Dehon.

The film started life as a part of a 90-minute TV special for CBS, entitled Orson's Bag, consisting of Welles' 40-minute condensation of The Merchant of Venice, and assorted sketches around Europe. This was abandoned in 1969 when CBS withdrew its funding over Welles' long-running disputes with US authorities regarding his tax status, and Welles continued to fashion the footage in his own style. The film features contributions from British comedians Tim Brooke-Taylor, Graeme Garden, and Bill Oddie, before the trio became known as The Goodies. Segments The film consists of five segments, all of them comic: Churchill, Swinging London, Four Clubmen, Stately Homes and Tailors. =1. Churchill= The first segment is filmed entirely in silhouette. Welles plays Winston Churchill fielding press questions and then exchanging bons mots with Nancy Astor (Oja Kodar). Each line spoken by Churchill is a well-known witticism commonly attributed to him. Graeme Garden provides narration. =2. Swinging London= The longest segment of the film (9 mins) has a bowler-hatted reporter (Tim Brooke-Taylor) wandering through \\"Swinging London\\", searching for Carnaby Street with limited success. Most of the supporting roles are played by Welles in a variety of disguises: a British policeman, an old lady selling \\"dirty postcards\\", a Chinaman luring customers into a strip club, and the omnipresent one-man band. The song \\"One Man Band\\" was written by Bill Oddie (who had joined Brooke-Taylor and Garden for the second season of the TV sketch series Broaden Your Mind). Garden appears briefly as a rude workman and as a Morris dancer. This segment is noteworthy for what reviewers have called its \\"Pythonesque\\" style \\\\- which is significant as it was filmed before Monty Python's Flying Circus first aired in October 1969. A shortened, not restored version of Swinging London appeared in the documentary Orson Welles: One-Man Band on the 2005 Criterion DVD of F for Fake. =3. Four Clubmen= Apart from Welles' introduction, the soundtrack has been lost for this segment. It is set in a London club in which Welles plays four different members, all under heavy make-up, plus a noisy waiter who drops things. =4. Stately Homes, a.k.a. Lord Plumfield versus Welles= This segment features Welles as a journalist wandering around the stately home of Lord Plumfield. Welles also plays the eccentric, penniless Plumfield; Tim Brooke-Taylor has a cameo as Plumfield's moronic son; and Graeme Garden plays Plumfield's feeble butler, Blemish, who does chicken impressions. (Plumfield says, \\"I'd give him the sack except we need the eggs.\\") Garden also provides some narration. =5. Tailors= Welles plays a shy American tourist being measured by two rude English tailors (Charles Gray and Jonathan Lynn) who are dismissive of his ignorance of tailoring, and keep mocking his weight. Production In 1969, Orson Welles was in London and got in touch with writer/performers Tim Brooke-Taylor and Graeme Garden. Brooke-Taylor recalled, The collaboration between Welles and Brooke-Taylor led to both men appearing in the Italian comedy The Thirteen Chairs (a.k.a. 12 + 1). Of the \\"Lord Plumfield\\" sketch, Garden recalled, The bulk of filming was completed in 1968-9, although assorted linking narrations and inserts were filmed by Welles in 1971. The 1971 sequences are noticeable because Welles had grown a long beard by then, whereas he was clean-shaven in all the parts he played in 1968-9. The film was left unfinished in Welles' lifetime. After Welles' death in 1985, all of his unfinished films were bequeathed to his long-term companion and mistress Oja Kodar, and she in turn donated many of them (including One Man Band) to the Munich Film Museum for preservation and restoration. In 1999 the Munich Film Museum then edited together the complete footage into a 29-minute cut, which has subsequently been screened at numerous film festivals.

It also includes smaller segments like radio, music, out-of-home advertising, animation, gaming and visual effects (VFX) and internet advertising.Yojana August, 2011 The entertainment industry in India has registered explosive growth in the last two decades making it one of the fastest-growing industries in India. From a single state-owned channel, Doordarshan in the 1990s there are more than 400 active channels in the country. Worldwide, 2010 saw the global economy begin to recover from a steep decline in 2009. Improved economic conditions in 2010 played a major role in a rebound in customer spend. Since the world economy began to recover from the global financial crisis of 2008, improved economic conditions played a major role in a rebound in consumer spending. While India was not critically impacted by the downturn in 2008 and 2009, it demonstrated one of the highest growth rates this year and continued to at a healthy pace. The rising rate of investments by the private sector and foreign media and entertainment (M&E;) majors have improved India's entertainment infrastructure to a great extent. As per the recent report by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC), Indians are likely to spend more on entertainment in the coming years with steady growth in their disposable income. And as per the combined survey report by KMPG and FICCI, the entertainment industry in India is expected to expand by 12.5% every year and is likely to reach US$20.09 billion by the year 2013. The industry pegged at INR 5808 billion in 2009 as compared to INR 3565 billion in 2005. The Indian media and entertainment industry grew from US$12.9 billion in 2009 to US$14.4 billion in 2010, a growth of 11 percent, according to a report by the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FICCI) and research firm KPMG. The report also states that backed by positive industry sentiment and growing media consumption, the industry is estimated to achieve growth of 13 percent in 2011 to touch US$16.2 billion. As the industry braces for exciting times ahead, the sector is projected to grow at a CAGR of 14 percent to reach US$28.1 billion by 2015.  Television industry  Television is one of the major mass media of India and is a huge industry and has thousands of programs in all the states of India. Today India boasts of being the second- largest television market in the world. The small screen has produced numerous celebrities of their own kind some even attaining national fame. TV soaps are extremely popular with housewives as well as working women. Approximately half of all Indian households own a television. Television first came to India in the form of Doordarshan (DD) on Sept 15, 1959. Doordarshan is the National Television Network of India and also one of the largest broadcasting organisations in the world. Apart from the state-run Doordarshan, there are six direct to home players with 54.52 million DTH users in India with the present prediction; it is likely to overtake the US in terms of the largest DTH market in the world. As of 2012, the country has a collection of free and subscription services over a variety of distribution media, through which there are over 823 channels of which 184 are pay channels. Total television viewership of 415 million is amongst the world's highest with nearly 15-16 Television companies beaming programmers to India. The major players being Doordarshan, STAR TV (Satellite Television Asia Network), Zee Television, United Television, CNN, Sony Television, ATN (Asia Television Network), BBC World, SUN TV, Discovery Channel, TNT and others. India's television business has an estimated $3.4 billion in revenue in 2005, according to PricewaterhouseCoopers. With the government focusing more on digitalization, TV distribution is taking a new shape. Digitalization has been a major challenge for the government as the digital cable is not gaining momentum. According to the new deadline, pan India digitalization is expected to happen by December 31, 2014. Another challenge for the Television Industry is Average Revenue Per User (ARPU). India is amongst the countries with the lowest ARPU as compared to developed countries like the US and UK where ARPU is around US$45 to US$60, India has an ARPU approximately US$3.5. Print industry The Indian print media industry is expected to grow by 9.6 percent over the period 2010-15. The print industry is expected to grow from Rs 128 bn in 2006 to Rs 232 bn by 2011, at 12.6% CAGR. While the newspaper industry is estimated at Rs 112 bn, the magazine segment is valued at Rs 16 bn.http://www.equitymaster.com/detail.asp?date=09/14/2007&story;=5&title;=Indian- Print-industry-An-overview The newspaper industry is also projected to perform well for the next five years growing at a CAGR of 10.1 percent according to a report titled \\"India Entertainment and Media Outlook 2011\\" by PricewaterhouseCoopers. Indian print industry is growing strong and is expected to grow similarly while the global print industry is moving towards digitalization and showing a negative growth rate year on year. The print industry in India is the world's second-largest with over 90 million copies in circulation daily after China with 130 million copies in circulation daily. Most newspaper has an online presence and a growing view counts on their portals. Much of the entertainment and media segments are now focusing on growth in regional areas and smaller towns. In 2009, when there was a slowdown, the regional print showed growth in local to local advertisement.http://www.npes.in/print/INDIAN%20PRINT%20INDUSTRY.pdf In 2010, regional print further increased its share in overall print advertisement revenue pie. Regional papers give advertisers access to localized populations and their niche target audience, difficult to do via national broadcast media. Newspapers have realized the value and have gone one step further and have launched area specific newspapers. With the rise in literacy in past decade has let to the rise of regional newspapers, they have much greater reach and a large audience to entertain. Magazines have not been at their best performance in past few years. However, niche magazine are doing well and is expected to show positive growth. The major challenge faced by this segment of media and entertainment industry is newsprint which continues to threaten profitability. Newsprint forms a major component of the cost of publishing a newspaper. It is roughly 40 -50 percent of the total cost. Film industry Films are the most important form of entertainment in India. Film industry in India is among the largest in the world in terms of films produced (approximately 1000) in different languages which include films in Hindi, Kannada, Bengali, Tamil, Marathi, Telugu, Punjabi and Malayalam. Approximately twenty-three million Indians go to see a film every day. Film Federation of India is the apex body of the film industry in India whose objective is to popularise and promote the cinemaFilm Federation Of India http://www.filmfed.org/ According to unofficial estimates available in January 2001, the Indian film industry has an annual turnover of Rs. 60 billion (approximately US$1.33 billion). It employs more than 6 million people, most of whom are contract workers as opposed to regular employees. As at the start of 2001, a reasonable budget film in any Indian language could cost US$1.75 million. A low budget Indian language film can be made for even as low as Rs. 15 million. A big-budget Indian language movie can cost in excess of US$30 million. The 'bigness' of the budget is attributable mainly to the high fees paid to 'stars', celebrated music directors, high-end technologies and expensive travel costs to shoot in exotic locations worldwide. At the time of writing, it is believed that lead actors 'stars' are paid around Rs. 100 million (US$440,000) per film. India has a National Film Development Corporation (NFDC) which finances some films. A few filmmakers, who would find it hard to obtain finance from the regular sources, have been financed by the NFDC. However, NFDC cannot be considered to play a central role in the film industry because it finances too few films which, too, are not of the type that has made the Indian film industry so vibrant. =Animation industry= Radio industry Radio broadcasting in India started in British India in 1923 with the Radio Club of Bombay. All India Radio (AIR) was established in 1936 which is one of the largest radio networks in the world including the AIR FM. AM, FM and even Satellite Radio have made a huge impact on the Industry in India. Most of the media houses either already have a presence in the industry or are looking to get a license in the next round. Famous stations are Radio Mirchi (of the Times Group) has maintained a lead position in most cities it operates in and other channels like Radio City, Red FM, Big FM, Fever, Radio One have also been able to get significant traction.http://strat.in/2009/08/insights-into-the-indian-radio-industry/ Till 1990 Indian economy was closed, no private player was allowed to enter and Akashwani has the sole responsibility to cater to the wide and culturally diverse Indian consumer base. In the last 5 years, the Radio industry in India has seen a compound annual growth rate of approximately 20% and has grown to a size of around Rs. 8.3 billion in 2008. By the end of 2010, there were 245 active radio stations in India and had a market size of INR 10 billion. It registered a cumulative growth rate of 11 percent from 2007 to 2010. The industry is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20 percent over 2010- 2015 and is expected to be INR 25 billion in terms of revenue. Phase III privatisation of the radio FM is expected to add 839 new radio stations in 294 cities. The government has approved Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) in FM radio channels to 26 percent from the current 20 percent. Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is planning to release additional frequencies in all markets, automatic renewal of the license at the end of the initial term of the license of the term. One of the major reasons for such an interest in the industry is the increased profitability. The government has cut the license fees to 1/10th of the previous amount. Controversial IP protection by the Indian film industry The indian film industry has allegedly engaged in illegal activities by hiring IT professionals who were said to have launched a Denial- of-service attack against websites that they believe are violating the intellectual property of their clients.

From October 1941, on her initiative and involving many co-workers, she organized and provided assistance to mostly Serbian Orthodox women and children detained in the Ustashe camps in the Independent State of Croatia, a Nazi puppet state established in occupied Yugoslavia. The operation, known as \\"Action Diana Budisavljeviƒá\\", succeeded in saving around 10,000 children. Budisavljeviƒá described the course of the Action in a diary, starting with 23 October 1941 and the final entry on 7 February 1947. The diary was released in Croatian in 2003. After her story was better publicized in 2012, she received substantial posthumous recognition. Early life Born in Innsbruck, Diana Obexer married Julije Budisavljeviƒá in 1917, who at that time worked as an assistant at the surgical clinic in Innsbruck. By 1919, the couple had moved to Zagreb, at the time part of Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. Julije Budisavljeviƒá was an ethnic Serbian, who was known for founding the surgical clinic at the Faculty of Medicine, University of Zagreb. World War II During World War II, Yugoslavia was invaded by the Axis forces in April 1941 and the Nazi-allied Independent State of Croatia began a genocidal campaign against Serbs, Jews and Roma, setting up numerous concentration camps in Croatia. After she learned about children held at the camp Lobor-Grad, in October 1941, together with a number of co-workers, in particular Marko Vidakoviƒá and ƒêuro Vukosavljeviƒá, she launched a relief campaign named \\"Action Diana Budisavljeviƒá\\". The Action took care of mostly Serbian children but also women held in various concentration camps including the Jasenovac death camps.Dragoje Lukiƒá, Rat i djeca Kozare (Beograd: Knji≈æevne novine, 1990), p. 27 With the help from the local Jewish community in Zagreb, which had permission to support the camp inmates, her team sent supplies of food, medicines, clothes and also money, first to Lobor-Grad and later to Gornja Rijeka and √êakovo. Her team also helped the members of the Croatian Red Cross at the main railway station in Zagreb, providing travel supplies for workers in trains that stopped there on their way to forced labor in Germany ‚Äì some of those men, women and children returned to Zagreb after they were stopped in Maribor and Linz and were not allowed to travel further due to their illness ‚Äì they were taken care by the Red Cross and the Action. During that work, in March 1942, Budisavljeviƒá met the head nurse, Dragica Habazin, who became a close collaborator in the following months and years in helping the inmates from various camps that were relocated to Zagreb and other places. At the beginning of July 1942, with assistance from German officer Gustav von Koczian,, she obtained written permission to take the children from the Stara Gradi≈°ka concentration camp. With the help of the Ministry of Social Affairs, especially prof. Kamilo Bresler, she was able to relocate child inmates from the camp to Zagreb, Jastrebarsko and later also to Sisak. After the rescue efforts in Stara Gradi≈°ka, Budisavljeviƒá, wearing the uniform of a Red Cross nurse, took part in the transport of children from Mlaka, Jablanac and Ko≈°utarica. More than 6,000 children had been moved away from those camps in July and August 1942. After obtaining permission in August 1942 to move the children from the institutions in Zagreb into the care of families, she and Kamilo Bresler worked together with the Zagreb Archdiocese branch of the Caritas and in that way made it possible for several thousands of children to be placed with families in Zagreb and rural communities. According to the Correction of the Report from Marko Vidakovic in May 1945, Budisavljeviƒá stated that the Action succeeded in saving about 10,000 children from the concentration camps. At the request by Kamilo Bresler in August 1942, she and Ivanka D≈æakula, with some other co-workers, started to compile card-file information on children, based on transportation lists and sources from various institutions that kept their own lists. By the end of the war the files contained information of approximately 12,000 children. Upon a signed request on 28 May 1945 by a Federal State of Croatia official Tatjana Mariniƒá, at that time Head of Ministry of Social Affairs, Budisavljeviƒá handed over the card-files. It is not known where they are now and whether they are preserved or not. Later life Budisavljeviƒá was almost forgotten after the war, for decades publicly rarely mentioned or not at all, and if mentioned then described in a role not according to her real importance, because the post-war authorities did not look favorably upon her. She lived in Zagreb with her husband until 1972, when they moved back to Innsbruck. She died on 20 August 1978, aged 87. Legacy In 2003, the Croatian State Archives published Budisavljeviƒá's war-time diary, translated from German to Croatian by Silvija Szabo. Silvija Szabo is a granddaughter of Budisavljeviƒá and a retired professor at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, University of Zagreb, who in 2005 stated that she had read an April 1983 Vjesnik feuilleton that had described Diana Budisavljeviƒá as a mere Communist Party activist inside the Red Cross. She knew that that had not been the truth, so she decided to read Budisavljeviƒá's diary to learn the full extent of her grandmother's deeds. A Zagreb film production studio Hulahop produced a documentary about Diana Budisavljeviƒá, titled Dianina lista, and produced by Dana Budisavljeviƒá and Miljenka ƒåogelja. The documentary won the prize from the EAVE European Producers Workshop at the When East Meets West Forum in January 2012 in Trieste. One of the authors is a distant relative of Diana Budisavljeviƒá's husband, yet had not heard of her heroism until seeing a 2009 documentary about Zagreb in World War II. On 15 February 2012, at the Serbian Statehood Day, the President of the Republic Boris Tadiƒá posthumously decorated Diana Budisavljeviƒá with the Golden Medal of Milo≈° Obiliƒá for courage and personal heroism. In October 2013, Serbian Patriarch Irinej awarded posthumously Diana Budisavljeviƒá with the high distinction of the Serbian Orthodox Church ‚Äì the order of Empress Milica. Since May 2012 a park in the Dubrava district of Zagreb has been named \\"Park Diane Budisavljeviƒá\\". Streets in Belgrade, Kozarska Dubica, and Gradi≈°ka have been named for Diana Budisavljeviƒá, and an initiative was active in 2015 to do so in Banja Luka as well. In October 2017, a park area with a memorial plate for children injured in Sisak concentration camp has named \\"Park Diane Budisavljeviƒá\\".http://sisak.hr/usvojen-rebalans-proracuna-za-2017-godinu/ In September 2018, the local district representation of Donaustadt (Vienna), decided to name a local alley \\"Diana-Budisavljevic Gasse\\". In June 2017, the European co-production fund Eurimages granted 160,000 EUR in support for the Croatian-Slovenian-Serbian co-production The DB Campaign (working title Diana's List) by Dana Budisavljeviƒá. The world premiere of the resulting feature film The Diary of Diana B. was at the Pula Film Festival on 18 July 2019. The film was awarded with the Grand Golden Arena for Best Festival Film, Golden Arena for best Director, Golden Arena for Editing, Golden Arena for Best Music, Golden Gate of Pula Audience Award and recognition for Best Croatian Feature Film Her birthplace on Maria Theresia Street in Innsbruck is known as Obexer House.

Cornelis Brouwer Biography in De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) by Arnold Houbraken, courtesy of the Digital library for Dutch literature While visiting with van der Neer, who took his pupil along on trips to Leiden and Amsterdam, Brouwer met Adriaen van der Werff and in 1676 helped the seventeen-year-old by taking his self-portrait and showing it to all of his art friends in Rotterdam, who were amazed at the ability of such a young man. According to the Netherlands Institute for Art History (RKD) he is known for genre works and historical allegories of the Rembrandt school.Cornelis Brouwer in the RKD He is sometimes confused with Justus Brouwer.

The symbol was created in 2006 based on the principle of the traditional red remembrance poppy for Remembrance Day. In contemporary service, most animals in United Kingdom military service are military working dogs, particularly in the 1st Military Working Dog Regiment. Historically the greatest number of animal casualties in conflict have been horses and ponies.  Background  The purple poppy was created in 2006 by the charity Animal Aid as a way to commemorate animals which served during conflicts as the charity viewed that they had been the forgotten victims of war. Approximately eight million horses and donkeys died during the First World War. It was created to be worn alongside red or white poppies. Animal Aid continued to sell the purple poppy with proceeds going to them until 2015 when they replaced the symbol with an enamel purple paw badge as they felt it was being misinterpreted the animals are not \\"heroes\\" but victims. The purple poppy symbol was subsequently picked up by the Murphy's Army charity in 2016 and continued to be sold by them. There is a specified purple poppy day in addition to Remembrance Day on 11 November where purple poppies would be worn. The date is movable, however. In 2018, in order to coincide with 100 years since the end of the First World War, 23 August was chosen as purple poppy day to coincide with the Battle of Mons. This was the date of the first battle between British and German forces during the First World War.  Reaction  Wreath of purple poppies at The Cenotaph, Whitehall in London on the centenary of the end of World War I in 2018 The purple poppy was not endorsed by The Royal British Legion, which sells the official red remembrance poppies. However they did state: \\"We see no conflict in wearing the red poppy next to the purple or white poppy. Many animal rights supporters also support our work. We do ask that the items are not offered alongside each other however as this would confuse the public.\\" Some towns have included purple poppies alongside red ones in official Remembrance displays.

History =1978‚Äì2015= Plans for Lycoming Mall were announced in 1975, with 674,000 sq. ft. of space and Gee Bee, Hess's, and Sears as anchors. Hess's would open on March 1, 1978, with the rest of the mall opening July 15, 1978, and Sears a few weeks later. Plans included a $4.7 million expansion in 1985 that added 115,800 sq. ft. and a Bon-Ton to the mall. J. C. Penney moved from downtown Williamsport to the mall in the late 1980s. During this time, an independent attempt to build a second area mall in downtown failed. Value City would close in March 2008, with Burlington Coat Factory announced as its replacement in May. Books-A-Million opened in November 2011, replacing a closed Borders. The Gap and RadioShack closed in February 2015, with a Gap Factory store opening in the Lycoming Crossing Shopping Center, near Lycoming Mall. Pennsylvania Real Estate Investment Trust put Lycoming Mall up for sale in January 2015. =Sale and downturn: 2016 ‚Äì present= The mall was sold to Kohan Retail Investment Group for $26.35 million on March 22, 2016, who owns it under the name Lycoming Mall Realty Holding. Macy's closed in March 2017, and owned its anchor store. J. C. Penney closed at the mall on July 31, 2017. Sears was announced to close in January 2018. Lycoming Mall's owners are appealing its tax assessment of $44.89 million. The former Macy's was sold for over $500,000 to MC Storage Lycoming LLC, and it will be changed into storage. Bon-Ton closed due to the chains liquidation. The mall lost power in late August 2018 due to owner not paying its PPL electric bill, but reopened the next day. Lycoming Mall faced sheriff's sale in February 2019 due to unpaid bills from the Lycoming County Water and Sewer Authority. The auction did not occur due to a partial payment by Kohan. Notoriety The mall is noted for the 90-foot-high, 55-foot-wide, 140 ton steel sculpture known as the Hadany Arch. It is named after Israel Hadany, who designed it in 1977. The arch was purchased by board members from Hess's and Crown American, with its dedication being in November 1978.Some sources report as 100-foot-high.

Only two were built, one in the UK and one in Canada. The latter did not fly until 1975, being under construction for 26 years; the former remained active until at least 1994. Design and development In 1947 the British Gliding Association held a competition for a two-seat glider design. The tandem seat Harbinger was designed jointly by Waclaw Czerwi≈Ñski, who had already developed several gliders in Poland before World War II, and Canadian Beverley Shenstone, who had worked in Germany on the Junkers Ju 52 then later, in the UK, on the Spitfire. The Harbinger came fifth in the competition, which the Kendall Crabpot won. The Harbinger was, apart from its wing mountings, an all wood aircraft. It had braced, high-set demountable wings each built around a single main spar. These were plywood covered ahead of the spar and fabric covered behind. The inner sections, which together provided about 11 ft (3.35 m) of the total 60 ft (18.3 m) span, had constant chord and were swept forward at about 17¬∞, partly to bring the centre of gravity (cg) forward and partly to enhance upward visibility from the rear seat. These sections were thinnest at the root, to minimise wing-fuselage aerodynamic turbulence. The outer wing panels were tapered, though the leading edges were unswept, and had elliptical wing tips. The outer panels carried ailerons and spoilers, each composed of four pairs of small square plates which rotated out above and below the wing, were situated at mid-chord across the junction between inner and outer panels. The wing roots were mounted to the front and rear of a horizontal metal rectangular frame built into the fuselage. On each side another pair of horizontal braces ran from the rear root connection to a point on the spar at the inner-outer panel junction. The front member of the fuselage frame was also shared by a second, vertical square fuselage frame. The external metal tube lift struts were attached to its lower corners. The rest of the fuselage was all-wood and plywood covered, oval in cross-section and tapering toward the tail. As designed, the cockpit canopy was multi-piece, rounded in profile and extended to the nose. The tail surfaces were conventional, with the tailplane on the upper fuselage. The rudder and elevators were unbalanced, the former extending to the bottom of the fuselage and moving in a small elevator cut-out. A central landing skid ran from the nose to below the bottom of the lift strut where there was a single, part exposed, fixed wheel. The extreme rear fuselage had a tail bumper extension. Two Harbingers were built, both over long periods, one in Canada and on in the UK. Construction of the latter began in February 1949 and the other was started at about the same time. The UK aircraft was built at Camphill, Great Hucklow, the home of the Derbyshire and Lancashire Gliding Club by Fred Coleman and was not completed until the Summer of 1957, when it was discovered that as designed the cg was too far aft. To counter this the forward fuselage was extended by 15 in (380 mm) by increasing the space between the seats. The extension resulted in a revised, more vertical canopy windscreen. It also increased the weight by about 45 lb (20.4 kg); in addition, about 25 lb (11.4 kg) of lead ballast in the nose was needed to get the cg to within the acceptable range. Construction of the Canadian aircraft was not so far advanced in 1957 and its builders chose to retain the original design fuselage but add slight rearward sweep to the outer wing leading edge, moving the center of pressure backwards. This aircraft lacked the spoilers but also the excess weight of the British aircraft, coming in close to the original design estimate. The UK aircraft, which has become known as the Harbinger Mk 2, first flew on 26 July 1958 at Hucknall; the Canadian Harbinger Mk 1 did not fly until 1975, some 26 years after building began. Operational history The UK Harbinger returned to Camphill after its early tests and flew there until damaged in an aerial collision in June 1959. Returned to flight in 1962 with a more rounded canopy closer to the original design, it was the highest ranked two seater at The Northern Glider Competition held at Doncaster in July 1965. In 1966 it made a fight of almost 9 hours duration at Camphill. After an inactive period, it was restored and flying again in 1985 and remained airworthy until at least 1994, flying at Lasham at the 22nd International Gliding Rally. It also appeared at the same event in 2000, though it did not fly. It remained airworthy until 2002. The Canadian Harbinger made some thirty fights with the Gatineau Gliding Club, based at Pendleton Airport near Ottawa, between 1975 and 1977 before being retired. Surviving aircraft The Canadian built Harbinger is in the collection of the Canada Aviation and Space Museum. It is not on public display but is accessible with advanced notice. The UK built Harbinger is currently kept at Bicester Gliding Centre and is flying (C of A March 2013).

His father was put on his trial in 1589 on the charge of having contrived the death of the Earl of Leicester by witchcraft and went into exile. In 1589 Croft was elected Member of Parliament for Carmarthenshire. He was a J.P. for Carmarthenshire and for Herefordshire from 1591 and for Oxfordshire from about 1592. In about 1592 he became steward of the lordships of Kerry, Kedewen and Montgomery, Montontgomeryshire and was steward of crown lands in Herefordshire from October 1592.

He was re-elected MP for Herefordshire in 1614. In about 1617, he became a Catholic and a monk at the English Benedictine priory of St Gregory the Great at Douai, where he wrote pamphlets in defence of his new faith.

The vessels were ordered in year 2000 to replace the eight boats of the Neustadt class. Using prefabricated hulls that had been built in the Yantar special economic zone of Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia, the three vessels were completed by Abeking & Rasmussen at Lemwerder, Germany. They are equipped with a diesel hybrid engine for fast speeds and a separate diesel-electric plant for an efficient cruising speed. The eponymous vessel Bad Bramstedt was commissioned on 8 November 2002 with a pennant number BG 24. Two other boats, Bayreuth (BG 25) and Eschwege (BG 26) followed on 2 May 2003 and 18 December 2003 respectively. With the transition of the German Federal Border Guard Bundesgrenzschutz into a federal police force (), the pennant numbers were changed to BP 24, BP 25 and BP 26. Bad Bramstedt and Bayreuth are based in Cuxhaven in the German Bight while Eschwege operates from Warnem√ºnde in the Baltic Sea.
