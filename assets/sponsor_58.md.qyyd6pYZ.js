History  The Red Curtain was designed by the engineer Felice Trojani, among the emergency equipments for the crew members who were about to get off the aerial view on the North Pole; of the equipment was also part of the Ondina 33 radio, through which the Marconist Giuseppe Biagi was able to launch the SOS first and then to lead the rescue to the survivors. The tent design was preceded by an accurate study of those used in previous polar expeditions, and was carried out by Moretti Company in Milan. The Red Curtain was of a central type, with a parallelepipedal base of 2.75 √ó 2.75 m for 1 m high, overlaid with a pyramidal part whose vertex was nearly 1 m from the ground. The access was secured through a circular entrance of one meter in diameter and closed by a windshield sleeve. The exterior walls and the bottom were in crude silk, not colored, while the inner walls were blue silk; The color was chosen as palliative against the snow ophthalmic. The tent, designed to accommodate up to four people, hosted nine (including two leg wounds, Umberto Nobile and Natale Cecioni), Titina's mascot, a part of the radio and the batteries that fed it. Once the curtain was recovered between the materials scattered on the pack, it was lifted by Trojani, while Mariano and Viglieri planted the picks in the ice and tensed the winds, loading the edges with recovered food and other weights. At the bottom were placed the cartons containing the sailing cards and the only surviving sleeping bag that, cut and opened, would host the two wounded Cecioni and Nobile, next to the catalytic stove on. To properly assess the height of the airship relative to the ground, were not sufficiently reliable altimeters available at the time, and was therefore used a more efficient system: from the cabin of the airship were dropped the vials of glass, stuffed with fuchsin, by measuring the time of a fall with a special stopwatch, made in Rome by Hausmann, starting from the release until the vial collapsed, packing red. In order to make the tent visible from above, the survivors decided to use the fallen firecracker vials to draw a line of red lines. Once communications were established through the radio, the rescuers became aware of the new color, and the journalists coined the name \\"Red Curtain\\". The continual and aggressive light of the Nordic summer made the delicate aniline vanish in just a few days, bringing the tent to its original livery. The Red Curtain was retrieved, along with Einar Lundborg's airplane and all the field materials, from the Krasin crew. Upon returning to Italy, Umberto Nobile donated the Red Curtain to the City of Milan, the sponsor of the polar expedition, who dedicated it to the Museum of the Castello Sforzesco, today the National Museum of Science and Technology Leonardo da Vinci, where Felice Trojani mounted it for the last time. The Red Curtain was exposed to the public until the mid -nineties, and is now waiting for a long and delicate restoration that once again allows its public exposure.

Featuring Sushant Singh Rajput and newcomer Sara Ali Khan in lead roles, it tells an inter-faith love story between a wealthy Hindu Brahmin girl whose family owns a lodge and shops near the historic Kedarnath Temple in the Uttarakhand mountains and a Muslim boy who is a 'pithoo' (porter) working in the same vicinity. As their relationship grows closer, the pair face many obstacles, including familial disapproval and contrasting backgrounds; when the sudden rains of the 2013 Uttarakhand floods devastate the region, the couple are forced to survive against the elements and face the ultimate test of their love. The film is produced by Ronnie Screwvala of RSVP Movies, and Guy in the Sky Pictures, along with Pragya Kapoor and it was co-written with Kapoor by Kanika Dhillon. The film's production began in June 2012, and principal photography commenced on 5 September 2017. The film released on 7 December 2018 to mixed reviews, but with praise for Sushant's performance, Khan's debut performance and Visuals. Plot In the valley around the Kedarnath temple, Mansoor Khan is a local Muslim porter. Mandakini \\"Mukku\\" Mishra is the daughter of a Hindu priest who runs the hostel for pilgrims by the temple on behalf of the temple committee. She is engaged to the nephew of the head priest. He was meant to marry her older sister, but he dumped the sister and switched to her when she grew up to be prettier, and her father agreed. Out of rebellion, Mukku flirts with the local boys and convinces them to come to her house and propose in order to embarrass her father and fiance. However, Mansoor is different, as they both notice each other and then Mukku makes the first move and hires him as her regular porter as she goes from her family home to a neighbouring village to help at her uncle's shop. She talks and talks to him and flirts outrageously and finally gets enough of a reaction to know he feels the same way. They are trapped in the rain together, share stories of their childhood, and then share a kiss. Her envious sister tells Mansoor that Mukku is just flirting with him as she has flirted with all the other boys. Mukku is unable to defend herself when he confronts her, but starts following him around everywhere, finally sitting in the rain outside his house. Her sister tries to cover for her, but she is found out and her family come for her, planning to throw out all the Muslims, which, not-so-coincidentally, will also open up space for the new luxury hotel they are planning. Mukku is taken home by her family who move up her wedding. Nevertheless she keeps insisting that Mansoor will come for her. Mansoor comes, but is spotted and beaten brutally by Mukku's fiance. However, his friend pleas to save him and carries an unconscious Mansoor back to his home. While the porter community prepares to leave the valley, Mansoor decides not to leave without Mukku. Mukku is married and slits her wrist, but is saved by her family; her now-husband taunts Mansoor with the news. Mansoor runs to Mukku and promises he will come back for her that night when she is recovered, so they can leave the valley together. Her husband plans to take his band of priests and kill Mansoor and drive out all the Muslims. All of a sudden it rains and floods begin. Mansoor sends his mother with the other porters into the mountains and runs towards Mukku. She and her family are trying to gather the guests of their hostel in a top floor, her husband and his mother arrive driven in by the storm and Mukku refuses to go to him. And then the floor crashes down and her sister and mother are swept away along with half the other people. Mukku and her father and a few others make their way to the temple, Mansoor finds them there just as the water sweeps down. He grabs her hand in the flood, and her father holds on to her and all three are saved. After the water goes down, they make their way to a house that is still standing and wave at an Indian army helicopter that is coming to save them. Mansoor sends up the woman and child who are with them first, then Mukku's father, then Mukku, and finally prepares to go himself. But there is only space for one more person and the father of the family has not gone yet, so Mansoor sacrifices himself and sends him instead. Mukku screams as she helplessly watches Mansoor die as the ground below him crumbles into the raging river. Three years later, Mukku is still seen living with her father and running the lodge, listening to Mansoor's favourite song on the radio which she dedicated to him as she smiles.  Cast  * Sushant Singh Rajput as Mansoor Khan, a porter (pithoo) at Kedarnath, Mukku's love interest * Sara Ali Khan as Mandakini \\"Mukku\\" Mishra, Mansoor's love interest, Brinda's younger sister, Kullu's Wife * Nitish Bharadwaj as Brijraj Mishra, Mukku's father * Nishant Dahiya as Kullu (Dead), Mukku's husband * Alka Amin as Ameena Khan, Mansoor's mother * Sonali Sachdev as Lata Mishra (Dead),Brinda and Mukku's mother * Pooja Gor as Brinda Mishra ( Dead), Mukku's elder sister * Mir Sarwar as Bashir * Sunita Rajwar as Daddo * Arun Bali as Chief Priest * Faiz Khan as Hemchand * Sharad Vyas as Himalaya Tyagi * Priyadarshan as Tarang * Hitesh Bhardwaj as Helicopter Co-Pilot * Lalu Makhija as Uncle at party Production The film's principal photography began on 5 September 2017. The first motion poster of the film released on 19 August 2017. The first look of Sara Ali Khan came out on 8 October 2017. Rajput's portions of the shoot was completed on 16 June 2018. Sara Ali Khan promoting Kedarnath in 2018 In February 2018, a dispute between director Abhishek Kapoor and the producers KriArj Entertainment led to a lawsuit that threatened the completion of production. The producers later clarified their intent to continue production. An ensuing court case led KriArj to drop out of the film's production entirely when Ronnie Screwvala's RSVP Movies opted to take over. The legal battle brought about some confusion for the shooting schedule of lead actress Sara Ali Khan, as she was simultaneously shooting for her second film Simmba with Ranveer Singh. Due to having free days as per the Kedarnath producers' court case, Khan allotted those days to film with the Simmba crew; this decision was unfitting to Kedarnath director Kapoor who took Khan to court. The two eventually settled out of court as Khan agreed to split her time between both films. The case also had an effect on the release of the film; as the producers ended up losing several lucrative prospective release slots near the end of the year; it seemed as if the film would be releasing in 2019 and that Rohit Shetty-directed Simmba would be Sara Ali Khan's debut film. However, when the producers' of Ajay Devgn-starrer Total Dhamaal relinquished their 7 December release date in favor of late February 2019, RSVP Movies was quick to secure it for Kedarnath. In November 2018, priests of Kedarnath demanded a ban on the film as they believed it promotes love jihad. A BJP leader, Ajendra Ajay of Dehradun's BJP media relations team, also took issue and urged a ban; he wrote to the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC) asserting that the film makes fun of Hindu sentiments despite being set against the backdrop of the Uttarakhand floods. Speaking at the trailer launch of the film, producer Ronnie Screwvala addressed concerns by stating that he believed there was \\"nothing offensive in the film,\\" and that he would be \\"happy to talk\\" about objections once the Censor Board themselves have seen the film. Director Abhishek Kapoor concurred, urging people to watch the film itself and not judge based on the teaser. In December 2018, two lawyers from Andheri filed a complaint to the Mumbai police and the Films Division of Mumbai, requesting the film not to be released. They claimed that it promotes 'love jihad', and stated that the film's producers \\"cooked up an imaginary love story,\\" and warned that should the film release, it would \\"give birth to grave chaos and anarchy in the whole country and certainly cause huge destruction everywhere.\\" On 6 December, the day before the film's release, the Bombay High Court dismissed the lawyers' plea that the film hurt religious sentiments and \\"lowered the dignity of the eponymous deity,\\" and allowed the film to be released as planned. In an interview with the Mumbai Mirror, Sara Ali Khan denied that the film promoted 'love jihad,' stating that the film was \\"really not that kind of a film, rather it's about how Kedarnath is as much Mansoor's world as it's Mukku's. I don't understand this kind of divisiveness...just as everyone doesn't have to like every movie, we can coexist with different world views.\\" On 5 December 2018, a PIL (Public interest litigation) filed by Prakash Rajput, head of the IHS religious society, was met with disapproval from the High Court of Gujarat. Rajput asserted that the film hurt Hindu sentiments by portraying Muslim-Hindu love, and that it had a kissing scene, which was not appropriate for family audiences. The court questioned him thoroughly before eventually dismissing his complaints as \\"a publicity stunt\\" and fining him Rs. 5,000.  Marketing and release  The film was scheduled for release in June 2018, but was postponed to 7 December 2018. An official poster of film was released on 29 October 2018; the following day, 30 October, a teaser was released. The official trailer and theatrical release poster were released on 12 November 2018. On 5 November 2018, the first song and music video from the film was released, titled \\"Namo Namo,\\" a devotional song composed by Amitabh Bhattacharya and sung by Amit Trivedi, portrayed on Sushant Singh Rajput's character Mansoor, introducing him as a \\"jolly yet hardworking pithoo\\" (porter around the Kedarnath area), who cares for his customers as they pilgrimage. On 12 November 2018, lead actors Rajput and Khan started promotions of the film by appearing on the Reality TV competition show Indian Idol 10. On 15 November 2018, the film's second song was released on Youtube: \\"Sweetheart.\\" Written by Amitabh Bhattacharya, composed by Amit Trivedi, and sung by Dev Negi, the song is a \\"foot-tapping number\\" picturized on the lead pair as they dance enthusiastically to a stirring dhol beat. A mehendi/sangeet ceremony is in the backdrop of the song and hints at the developing relationship between the two. On 20 November 2018, a third song was released, \\"Qaafirana,\\" depicting the lead couple's budding romance on their journey through the Kedarnath hills. It was composed by Amit Trivedi, and sung by Arijit Singh and Nikhita Gandhi. On 24 November, a short dialogue promo of the film was released, titled \\"Panditji Senti Hogaye.\\" It depicts Mukku as a \\"free-spirited woman\\" who doesn't want to be confined to household chores and running her parents' hotel. She is in conflict with her dad, whom she calls \\"Panditji,\\" and dreams of going off on her own. On 27 November 2018, lead actors Rajput and Khan promoted the film on the Reality TV singing competition show Sa Re Ga Ma Pa. On 28 November 2018, the film's fourth song, \\"Jaan 'Nisaar,\\" was released. A love ballad sung in both male and female versions by Arijit Singh and Asees Kaur respectively, written by Amitabh Bhattacharya and composed by Amit Trivedi, the song depicts the caste-based conflict and heartbreak the couple eventually go through in their relationship. On 2 December, a second short dialogue video was uploaded -\\"Aadat daal lo\\", which depicts Mukku's wit against Mansoor's flirtatious insults, and eventually her romantic inclinations towards him. On 4 December, another short dialogue was released, titled \\"Koshish Ki Hai Kabhi\\" which reveals the ensuing romantic banter between Mukku and Mansoor as they journey through the mountains. 5 December, several days before the film's release, the producers held a special screening for Bollywood industry personalities. Soundtrack The songs of the film are composed by Amit Trivedi while lyrics are written by Amitabh Bhattacharya.  Reception  = Critical response = Kedarnath released to mostly mixed reviews from critics. While most of them highly praised Sushant's performance and Sara Ali Khan's debut performance, and acclaimed the visuals, they summarized the plot as \\"predictable\\" and \\"worn out.\\" Rachit Gupta of the Times of India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars, called it an \\"an all-too- familiar love story\\" yet praised the debut performance of Sara Ali Khan, calling her a \\"live wire,\\" and commending her on-screen charisma and confidence, saying that she reminds audiences of \\"a young and boisterous Amrita Singh (her mother) in films like Betaab and Chameli Ki Shaadi.\\" Sushant Singh Rajput gives a commendable support to Khan, but doesn't do much heavy lifting. While the film suffered from a slow pace, its climax and CGI buildup strongly helped the narrative. He noted no truly memorable songs save for \\"Namo Namo,\\" but stated that the setting of the film helped keep the film fresh, along with Khan. Ruchika Kher of Times Now News gave the film 3.5 out of 5 stars, saying that the film has all the ingredients of a hit film: \\"a fresh face (a star kid at that), an inter-faith love story, the backdrop of a real-life tragedy, and good performances.\\" She commended the chemistry between the two leads, saying that much of their romantic interplay can \\"bring a smile to your face.\\" Like other reviewers, she highly praised Sara Ali Khan, calling her \\"brilliant\\" and \\"a breath of fresh air,\\" noting that she gave a stellar performance in the climax. She also praised Rajput's nuanced performance, \\"effortlessly mixing restraint and aggression as required.\\" She admired Kapoor's direction and the film's songs as well, yet was critical of certain tonal inconsistencies in scenes where Rajput's character is attacked, and when Khan's family finds out about the romance. Overall, she called it a respectable debut film for Sara Ali Khan. Meena Ayer of Dna India gave the film 3 out of 5 stars. She highly praised Khan, calling her an \\"a superstar on the rise...extraordinarily-talented star kid,\\" finding it \\"hard to believe that this is her first film because she is so spectacular,\\" noting that director Abhishek Kapoor \\"does full justice to her.\\" Rajput was a \\"talented actor\\" who \\"is game to complement her without displaying any ego.\\" She criticized the predictability of the love story, saying that \\"the conflict is there, but it is not enough to evoke more than a certain degree of emotion.\\" In the second half of the film's disaster scenes, she praised Abhishek Kapoor for being \\"a sensitive director\\" who \\"stayed true to the story,\\" yet noted that the disaster scenes seem a bit \\"disturbing\\" and take up so much time that \\"a pall of gloom descends on the audience.\\" Yet she ultimately called it a worthy watch for Sara Ali Khan. Shubra Gupta of The Indian Express gave the film 2 out of 5 stars, calling the film a \\"weepie without the tears.\\" Like Rachit Gupta, she also noted the similarity of debutante Sara Ali Khan to her mother, showing a \\"perky confidence.\\" Sushant Singh Rajput was on average form, and while supporting actors Nishant Dahiya, Pooja Gor, and Alka Amin made an impact, Nitish Bharadwaj \\"as the angry ‚Äòdoor-ho-jaao-meri-nazaron-se- baap‚Äô is old, old hat.\\" She was more critical of the structure of the film, saying that the \\"writing is sketchy, and the tone confused, never quite knowing whether to go quiet and life-like or to swell with wailing violins.\\" Kunal Guha of the Mumbai Mirror have the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, praising the cinematography's well-defined landscaping, Sara Ali Khan's performance, and the song \\"Namo Namo.\\" He criticized the direction of Kapoor, Rajput's performance (calling it \\"struggling\\"), and the \\"ghisa-pita formula.\\" He said that Khan \\"shines\\" and that \\"she often conveys it through her eyes alone ‚Äì giving us a taste of the diverse faces she can throw on.\\" He was critical of the film's flow and tonality as a whole, saying it \\"seems like watching an '80s Hindi movie for an hour-and-a-half and then an '80s shark movie for another 10 minutes.\\" Manjusha Radhakrishnan of Gulf News gave the film 2.5 out of 5 stars, saying that the film is \\"perfectly stormy and is good for a one- time watch.\\" She noted that the brisk pace makes up for the lack of emotional investment in the lead character, and called Rajput \\"as earnest as they come in attempting to play Mansoor.\\" She praised Sara Ali Khan, calling her \\"a natural,\\" and that while she has rawness in a few emotional scenes, she \\"has a commanding screen presence.\\" She called the film as one that evidently \\"belongs to Khan as all forces are at work to display her range as an actor.\\" She said that the chemistry between the two leads worked well in the first half, but unraveled into melodrama in the second. She criticized the \\"archaic\\" antagonists, the fiance figure (Tarun Gahlot) and the father (Nitish Bharadwaj); she also noted how the second-half wedding feels undeserved. Yet she praised the visual effects of the natural disaster, saying that they \\"rattle you\\" and \\"makes you believe that a natural disaster is the biggest leveller in life.\\"  Box office  Kedarnath earned 6.85 crore on first day of opening from its India shows. In first weekend of opening, domestic earning was 27 crore. The first week domestic earning of the film was 40.85 crore. The film grossed 85.28 crore in domestic market and 11.36 crore in overseas market, taking worldwide gross to 96.64 crore.

The case became controversial when the official police reports differed from witness accounts and CCTV footage. Background =Philippine drug war= In accordance with his campaign promise, President Rodrigo Duterte initiated the war on drugs shortly after he took office on June 30, 2016. As of July 26, 2017, the Philippine Information Agency reported 68,000 anti-drug operations which resulted in around 97,000 arrests, 1.3 million surrenders, and around 3,500 drug personalities killed in legitimate police operations. Thousands of others have been killed by vigilantes, which the police have categorized as \\"deaths under investigation\\". The night of August 14‚Äì15, just prior to Delos Santos's death, was the \\"bloodiest night\\" in the Philippine drug war, where dozens of police operations resulted in 32 drug suspects killed and more than 100 arrested in the province of Bulacan. =Kian Loyd delos Santos= Kian Loyd D. delos Santos (May 26, 2000 ‚Äì August 16, 2017) was 17 years old at the time of his death and was a resident of Barangay 160, Caloocan. Delos Santos was the third of four siblings. His mother, Lorenza, worked as a domestic helper in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, while his father, Saldy, operated a sari-sari store which was manned by Kian from 5:30 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. every day before he went to school. After closing the store at night, he would usually walk around the block for some small talk with neighborhood friends. At the time of his death, he was a Grade 11 (senior high school) student at Our Lady of Lourdes College in Valenzuela. His high school principal stated that Delos Santos was never summoned to his office for any delinquency or misconduct. According to a classmate and close friend of his, Delos Santos wanted to become a cadet of the Philippine National Police Academy. Delos Santos was also in favor of the government's war on drugs, according to another classmate. Both Senior Superintendent Chito Bersaluna, the Police Chief of Caloocan, and Chief Inspector Amor Cerillo, the commander of the local Police Community Precinct, have separately admitted that Delos Santos was not on their police watch list. However, they believed that he was a drug runner \\"based on a statement of another arrested drug suspect\\". The officials of Barangay 160, Caloocan also confirmed that Delos Santos was not on their drugs watch list. On August 26, 2017, a Catholic funeral Mass for Delos Santos was held at 8 a.m., at a parish in Sta. Quiteria, Caloocan; it was attended by his family and friends, and hundreds of other people, including human rights advocates. At around 2 p.m., Delos Santos was interred at La Loma Cemetery. Incident Barangay 160, Caloocan (in 2016), where the victim lived At around 8:00 p.m PST on August 16, 2017, officers of the Philippine National Police (PNP) led by PO3 Arnel Oares, were conducting a \\"one-time, big-time\\" anti-illegal drugs operation in Barangay 160, Caloocan where Delos Santos lived. During the anti-drug operation, Delos Santos went missing for almost an hour, which prompted his family to look for him at the nearest police station but failed to find him there. Several gunshots were then heard. At 8:57 p.m., C/Insp. Amor Cerillo and another police officer, both in plainclothes, arrived at the hall of Barangay 160 to report a supposed shootout. In a muddy and dark alley near his house, which was the site of the alleged encounter, Delos Santos was found in fetal position with gunshot wounds to his head. Recovered from his corpse were a .45-caliber pistol, four cartridges, and two sachets of suspected methamphetamine. =Police report= According to the official police report, at around 8:45 p.m, Delos Santos tried to flee when he noticed the police officers approaching him. He then drew his gun and \\"directly shot\\" towards the police, which prompted PO3 Arnel Oares to fire back in self-defense, killing Delos Santos. The pistol, cartridges, and two sachets of methamphetamine were then found in Delos Santos's possession. According to Cerillo and Bersaluna, a drug dealer that they earlier arrested claimed that Delos Santos was the mule of \\"Neneng\\" Escopino, a local drug dealer on the police watch list. =Witness accounts and CCTV footage= Witnesses claim that Delos Santos was just loitering near his house at around 8:00 p.m., when two unidentified men grabbed him and led him away. The barangay's CCTV footage of the incident shows that at 8:24 p.m., a young man believed to be Delos Santos was being dragged by two men in plainclothes towards the area where his corpse would be later found. The video also showed a third man that headed towards the same direction. Cerillo confirmed that the two men in the video were plainclothes police officers. He also clarified that the person being dragged was not Delos Santos, but rather a police asset. Bersaluna and Cirillo also clarified that police officers are not required to wear their uniforms during anti-illegal drugs operations. Two witnesses who approached Dominic Almelor of ABS-CBN News claimed that Delos Santos was blindfolded by the two men and forced to hold a gun, fire it, and run. Another witness who approached Saleema Refran of GMA News claimed that Delos Santos begged for his life before getting shot. Afterwards, the shooters approached the witness and asked him if he knew the victim, which he denied. The witness later confirmed that the men who were filmed inside the barangay hall reporting the alleged shootout were the same men who shot Delos Santos. A 13-year-old witness interviewed by The Manila Bulletin claimed that she saw Delos Santos being punched and slapped by four armed plainclothes officers before he was dragged away. Delos Santos's uncle, Randy, questioned the police claim that the victim had a concealed firearm, since his nephew was wearing boxers at that time. Delos Santos's father, Saldy, also pointed out that the pistol was recovered from the left hand of his otherwise right-handed son. Reactions =Public response and protests= Many Filipino netizens expressed outrage over Delos Santos's death. Both the hashtag #JusticeforKian and the phrase \\"Kian delos Santos\\" were among the top Philippine trends on Twitter on August 18. A rally titled Himagsikan para kay Kian (\\"Revolution for Kian\\") took place on August 21 (Ninoy Aquino Day) at the People Power Monument in Quezon City. Among the groups present were Akbayan, Alliance of Progressive Labor, Alyansa Tigil Mina, Sentro, Partido ng Manggagawa, Kalipunan ng Kilusang Masa, Block Marcos, Silent Minorities, and Kalipun. Senator Bam Aquino, former Bayan Muna Representative Teddy Casi√±o, and former Education Secretary Armin Luistro were also present. A moment of silence was held at 8:24 p.m., the same time Delos Santos was allegedly filmed being dragged by police officers on August 16. The protesters‚Äînumbering from 500 to 1,000‚Äîalso called for the investigation of other drug war killings. Earlier that same day, the Liberal Party Youth, with the support of other groups, also held a rally at Plaza Miranda in Manila, denouncing Delos Santos's killing. The rally also commemorated the 1971 Plaza Miranda bombing and the 1983 Assassination of Senator Ninoy Aquino. =Public figures= During a press briefing on August 18, Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella called the shooting of Delos Santos an \\"isolated\\" incident, and added \\"[President Duterte] will defend the police in their carrying out of duties. However, he will also not tolerate any abuse and any breaches of the law\\". On August 19, in an interview with Radyo Pilipinas, Assistant to the Presidential Spokesperson China Jocson stated: \\"Presidential Spokesperson Ernesto Abella would like to make it clear that the violent death of any Filipino is one death too many, especially that of Kian Loyd delos Santos. This deeply regrettable incident has triggered deep public sentiment, and challenges those in law enforcement to be wary of the reckless exercise of power and authority.\\" Also on the same day, the Department of Education released a statement saying it \\"strongly condemns\\" the killing of grade 11 student Kian Delos Santos and that while it acknowledged \\"efforts to battle illegal drugs,\\" it maintained that \\"upholding the rule of law should not be compromised.\\" The agency also said that it \\"denounces all forms of violence against our students, teachers, and personnel.\\" Also on August 19, during an emergency peace and order council meeting, Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan said \\"It seems hard to believe that a 17-year-old would shoot it out with three police officers\\" and added: \\"even if Kian were indeed a drug pusher, he shouldn't have been killed unless the cops were only defending themselves. The public perception is that the cops killed Kian when he was obviously helpless.\\" Senator Risa Hontiveros was among the first public figures who condemned the murder of Kian delos Santos. She was one of the main initiators of a Senate investigation against the police personnel that killed Delos Santos. She also took legal custody of the witnesses of the case, with proper written consent from the minor and their parents, after fears of police retaliation against the witness surfaced. During the Senate investigation, Hontiveros caught Duterte's justice secretary, Vitaliano Aguirre II, drafting fabricated charges against her through text messages during the hearings. Aguirre's text messages instructed former Negros Oriental representative Jacinto Paras, a member of controversial group VACC, to 'expedite' cases against Hontiveros, the lead investigator against the murderers of Kian delos Santos. The revelation was protested nationwide as instead of focusing on the murder case, Duterte's justice secretary was focusing on how to imprison Hontiveros. On August 16, 2018, a year after the murder, Hontiveros filed a resolution seeking to declare every 16 August as a \\"National Day of Remembrance\\" for all the victims of extrajudicial killings (EJKs) under the Duterte government's war on drugs in commemoration of Kian delos Santos. Arrested senator Leila de Lima, a key figure against the Philippine Drug War, also condemned the murder of Kian delos Santos. She asked the Supreme Court of the Philippines to allow her to be present in the Senate investigation against the murderers of Kian, however, the court rejected her request. She criticized President Duterte after Duterte commented that the drug sweep was \\"good.\\" Senator JV Ejercito, through a series of tweets, described the incident as \\"very very disturbing\\" pointing out that Delos Santos was the same age as his eldest son. He recommended that the police officers involved should all be legally prosecuted. Senator Joel Villanueva called it the \\"breakdown of our humanity, with people cheering the killings of individuals who have not been proven guilty\\" and added that \\"we cannot allow lawlessness in this country\\". In a statement, Senator Francis Escudero described the police officers involved as \\"killers and criminals\\". While Senator Sonny Angara called for the reform of the justice system and decried vigilante justice and killings. In a statement, National Youth Commission chairperson Aiza Seguerra said: \\"We want to curb the drug menace; however, we are alarmed by the deaths and injury of minors in the process.\\" Senators Antonio Trillanes, Win Gatchalian, and Loren Legarda also condemned the shooting of Delos Santos. Meanwhile, Senator Panfilo Lacson, a former police director general, insinuated that the PNP would cover up the incident. On August 20, Vice President Leni Robredo visited the wake of Delos Santos and inspected the site of the shooting. On her weekly radio show on DZXL, Robredo condemned the shooting, saying: \\"kung nangyari sa kanya, puwedeng mangyari sa mga anak natin (if it happened to him, it could also happen to our children)\\" and later added \\"[I]lan na ba iyong Kian na dumaan? Ilan pa ba iyong Kian na mangyayari? Kaya tayo naman, kapag ganito, tingin ko obligasyon natin ipahayag iyong ating pagkamuhi sa ganitong klaseng pangyayari (How many Kians have we had? How many more Kians will follow? That's why when this happens, I think it is our obligation to express our condemnation)\\". During the visit, Robredo was accompanied by human rights lawyer Jose Manuel Diokno of the Free Legal Assistance Group (FLAG), who offered his legal services to the Delos Santos family. Other politicians who visited the wake include Senators Bam Aquino, Risa Hontiveros, and Antonio Trillanes, Kabataan Partylist representative Sarah Elago, Caloocan Mayor Oscar Malapitan, and former Vice President Jejomar Binay. Representatives from Amnesty International, the Commission on Human Rights, and Iglesia ni Cristo also visited Delos Santos's wake. Kalookan Bishop Pablo Virgilio David condemned the shooting, calling it a \\"very specific case of abuse\\". Bishop David also criticized the ongoing drug war and the alleged abuses by the police. Father Antonio Moreno, head of the Society of Jesus in the Philippines, called Delos Santos's death a \\"heartless killing\\". Fellow Jesuit Father Jose Ramon Villarin, president of Ateneo de Manila University, also condemned the killing of Delos Santos. Lasallian Brother Armin Luistro, former Secretary of Education, called for \\"a minute of silence every night at 8:24 p.m. to remember Kian Loyd delos Santos and all innocent victims of merciless deaths in our land\\". Lingayen-Dagupan Archbishop Socrates Villegas, who is also the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of the Philippines (CBCP), ordered the churches in his archdiocese to ring their bells from 8:00 to 8:15 p.m. every night from August 22 to November 27 in honor of Delos Santos, and as \\"a call to stop approval of the killings.\\" The chief of the Philippine National Police (PNP), Director General Ronald dela Rosa expressed regret over Delos Santos's death, saying he was \\"very sorry for what happened\\". However, he added that he would rather see his police officers alive than dead. Dela Rosa also promised an investigation on the killing, saying: \\"Basta pag merong pang-aabuso hindi ko palalampasin 'yan\\". (\\"If there was indeed abuse [of authority] I will not let it pass\\"). Despite the incident, he guaranteed that the campaign against illegal drugs would continue. He also refused to visit Delos Santos's wake, believing it was inappropriate for him to do so, since the main suspects were police officers. He also claimed that visiting the wake would make him pretentious like the politicians. When President Rodrigo Duterte saw the CCTV tape, he allegedly called PNP Chief Ronald Bato Dela Rosa 'as fast as [he] can', and asked the PNP to bring those policemen who are involved in Kian's killing to jail. The president also \\"warned\\" some police officers. He later visited the wake of Delos Santos. Investigation The four police officers, who were tagged in the shooting of Delos Santos, were relieved from their posts. An autopsy was conducted on August 20, showed that Delos Santos sustained three gunshot wounds: the first entry point was at the back of the head, the second entry point was behind the left ear and the third entry point was inside the left ear. The family of Delos Santos, on August 25, filed murder and torture charges against police officers involved in the drug operation. Convictions and later events Three Caloocan City policemen Police Officer 3 Arnel Oares, PO1 Jeremiah Pereda and Jerwin Cruz were found guilty of killing Kian Lloyd delos Santos during an anti-narcotics and were sentenced to life in prison for murdering a teenager during a drug sting in 2017 by Caloocan Regional Trial Court Branch 125 Judge Rodolfo Azucena sentenced the three policemen to life in prison without the possibility of parole on November 29, 2018. On June 4, 2018, President Rodrigo Duterte approved the appointment of Roberto Fajardo to return to active duty after he was tapped as the new chief of the Philippine National Police-Highway Patrol Group, nearly a year after he was relieved due to the murder of Kian Loyd delos Santos. Deaths of Carl Arnaiz and Reynaldo de Guzman The case of Kian delos Santos has been likened to the cases of other teenagers, 19-year-old Carl Arnaiz and 14-year-old Reynaldo \\"Kulot\\" De Guzman. Arnaiz went missing for ten days; his dead body was found on August 28 in a morgue in Caloocan. According to the Caloocan police, Arnaiz was involved in a robbery at C-3 road. The police said that he declared a robbery to the driver of the vehicle he allegedly hit, and drew a gun. The driver reportedly sought help from the police and Arnaiz successfully shot PO1 Jefrey Perez and PO1 Ricky Arquta who in turn fired in retaliation causing the teenager's death. The police claimed in an August 30 report that they retrieved two packs of marijuana in his pocket and three packs of a substance suspected to be methamphetamine in his backpack. A CCTV footage showing the streets Brgy. 28, Caloocan where three men in motorcycles followed by the taxi approached in the area at 3:40am. The taxi was driven by the man named Tomas Bagcal, wherein Arnaiz allegedly robbed the taxi. Afterwards, the escorting motorcycles left the area. Aside from Bagcal, there were other passengers present who were named as PO1 Jeffrey Perez, de Guzman, Arnaiz and unnamed man. According to the witness, the man, after emerging from the taxi, who was talking to the phone is PO1 Perez. Shortly, Perez returns to the taxi. At 3:47am, the taxi parks at the sidewalk; though it was not shown in the CCTV, however, according to the witness, another taxi approaches and told that the robbery took place inside. A few minutes later, the taxi leaves and heads to C3 with de Guzman, Arnaiz, Perez and unnamed man on board. Two gunshots were heard by the witness. When investigating the source of the gunshots, the witness saw the lifeless body of Carl Arnaiz at the grassy area. Investigation team found .38 caliber revolver and three bullet containers which was allegedly used to return fire at the police. In early September 2017, the witness added that Perez accompanied de Guzman at the police mobile in C3. However, the statements between the witness and Bagcal are contradictory. On September 4, a paraffin test concluded that Arnaiz's right hand tested positive of gunpowder residue. During the Senate hearing, according to the PNP Crime Laboratory, Arnaiz sustained five gunshots in the body (four in the chest and one in the stomach). There were abrasions found on Arnaiz's body but the police cannot determined the cause of it. A Cainta, Rizal resident, Arnaiz left his house with de Guzman to eat midnight snacks on August 17 according to his parents. Arnaiz's father says that his son's only vice is smoking and denied he possessed said contraband. De Guzman's alleged body was found floating in Kinamatayang Kabayo creek in the town of Gapan, Nueva Ecija. De Guzman's father theorized that his son may have been killed so he could not testify against the killers of Arnaiz. The Philippine National Police conducted a DNA test on the corpse and said that the body is not De Guzman's. However, his parents dispute the findings saying that they are certain that the body is that of their son. According to the investigation, de Guzman sustained 30 stab wounds in the body. On January 19, 2018, in a 35-page resolution released to reporters, the Department of Justice indicted Perez and Arquilita with two counts of murder after probable cause for the slay of the two teenagers was found. Perez and Arquilita were also charged with two counts of torture and three counts of planting of evidence. The Caloocan City Regional Trial Court (RTC) Branch 122 issued warrant arrests against the aforementioned police officers. The warrants of arrest were dated January 23. No bail was recommended.

It was discovered by James Dunlop in 1826. Located approximately 4,000 light years away from Earth, it is located in the Carina-Sagittarius arm. There are 570 probable member stars within the angular radius of the cluster and 262 within the central part of the cluster. The tidal radius of the cluster is 6.0 - 8.1 parsecs (19 - 26 light years) and represents the average outer limit of NGC 5316, beyond which a star is unlikely to remain gravitationally bound to the cluster core. The brightest member of the cluster (lucida) is star No. 31 (mag. 9.40). Star 31 has significantly more barium than the rest of the group and the Ba II line is visually stronger than the rest of the cluster. The turn-off mass of the cluster is estimated to be at 5.0 . The hottest stars of the cluster are of spectral type B5‚ÄìB7. NGC 5316 has metallicity nearly the same as the solar one ([Fe/H] = ‚àí0.02 ¬± 0.05). The age of the cluster has been estimated to be from as low as 51 myr (by the first photometric study of the cluster, in 1968, by Lindoff) to as high as 195 myr (by Battinelli & Capuzzo- Dolcetta, 1991).

He inherited the estate of Ahtiala in Lohja, but he did not have any personal contact with the farm. Between 1908 and 1918 J√§nnes acted as the rector of Helsinki Agricultural Lyceum, for which he was called by Hannes Gebhard. In 1917 J√§nnes graduated as a Licentiate of Philosophy and later became a doctorate in the following year. J√§nnes was chairman of SOK from 1916 to 1917, when he failed to prevent the division of the co-operative movement. When the Finnish Federation of Agricultural Producers was founded in 1917, J√§nnes was elected as the first chairman of the delegation. The membership of the Organization was initially small and its influence was based on the expertise of management personnel. J√§nnes remained a relatively distant person to the members of Agricultural Producers' Union. At the start of the Finnish Foreign Service, J√§nnes was appointed to the 1918 Delegation Counselor and the Chairman of the Trade Commission in Berlin. Between 1919 and 1920 he served as envoy to Berlin. President K. J.

The Pellonraivaus Oy was founded in 1940 on the suggestion of the fence in order to promote the clearing of the new lands. After the war, the membership of the Agricultural Producers' Union expanded considerably and the operation became more brisk. J√§nnes did not give up on the chair until 1955.

History In 1914, the French army realised the need for increased fire support and mechanisation, which started the requirement for \\"Auto-canons\\" armoured cars armed with rapid fire guns. The author of this particular vehicle was Lieutenant Villeneuve-Bargnemont, who worked with Renault to produce a prototype based on a commercial 2.7 tonne truck chassis. the prototype vehicle was delivered August 15, 1915, but by that time the stabilisation of the front left little need for a vehicle of its type and only 4 vehicles would be completed. In use, the 15 hp engine was overloaded and the armourer grill didn't have enough airflow, leading to frequent overheating, The armoured cab overloaded the front suspensions. The vehicles would see limited use in the north and were dismantled shortly after the war.  Description  the vehicle is based on the Renault Type EP commercial truck, the truck had a wheelbase of 3 metres. the track width was 1620mm at the front axle, and 1670mm at the rear axle, it was rear wheel drive with steering front wheels, the driver sat on the right. the engine had the classical disposition at the time of being placed in front of the radiator, the truck bed was low enough that the wheel arches protruded. The cab was armoured in the style of the Auto-mitrailleuse Renault Mod√®le 1914, the armour had a wedge shape and was narrower over the engine compartment. The armoured ammunition rack was situated right behind the cab. The bed was not armoured, the bed sides dropped to form a platform for the gunner to stand on when firing over the sides. The 47mm Mle 1902 gun was installed on a pedestal mount between the wheel arches and was provided a shield. the gun placement allowed it a firing arc of 270¬∞ to the rear, an elevation of 25¬∞ and a depression of 10¬∞.

B. Robinson, A woman of the century Abigail Colburn \\"Abbie\\" Ballou Robinson (September 18, 1828 - 1893) was editor of the Green Bay Advocate and a political writer. Early life and family Abigail Colburn Ballou was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, on September 18, 1828. Her father was George Colburn Ballou (1798-1876), a cousin of Rev. Hosea Ballou and of President James A. Garfield's mother, Eliza Ballou. Her mother's maiden name was Ruth Eliza Aldrich (1801‚Äì1873). She had 4 siblings: Celia Ann Ballou Arnold (1825-1906), Oliver Aldrich Ballou (1827-1827), Alpha Bartlett Ballou Brown (1830-1884), and David Ballou (1833-1908). George C. Ballou, a Universalist, opened a Woonsocket spinning mill in 1829. He later bought control of several mills, and acquired a huge amount of farming lands. He died a millionaire. She was a woman of ideas quite in advance of her time, brought up, as her ancestors had been, under the Quaker system of repression. The daughter inherited from both parents most desirable qualities of devotion, courage and mental strength. She was educated in her native town and in New England boarding-schools. She studied music in Boston and spent three years in Warren Seminary, Rhode Island. She took the regular course in the institute in Pittsfield, Massachusetts. Career Abbie C. B. Robinson was as famous for political wisdom as her husband. Of her newspaper career it is somewhat difficult to write, since her public work was so closely interwoven with her private experiences during the very sorrowful and troublous period of her connection with the \\"Advocate.\\" She went into the office of that paper by the usual route, the desire to help her husband, in the early part of 1882, as Colonel Robinson's health was failing rapidly. Gradually the sick man's duties fell to his devoted wife, and before long she assumed charge of them all, taking the place in the office while she performed her own duties at home, doubly increased by the care of a dying husband. After three years of editorial management of the \\"Advocate\\", she was placed in a position to assume control of the whole establishment connected with the paper, including not only the business management, but also a job department, a bindery and store. That position she held for four years, during which time Colonel Robinson died. Then came the inevitable result, nervous prostration, an attempt again to take up the work, then her final retirement from the paper in 1888. She won for herself an enviable reputation as a woman of much force and ability, always animated by the highest, purest motives, and as an easy, graceful, cultured writer. She was also a good deal of a politician, with original Republican tendencies, though the \\"Advocate\\" was a Democratic paper. The story of her having brought out a Republican issue of the paper, when it was once put under her charge during Colonel Robinson's editorship, is a standard joke, and is periodically repeated in the State papers. The stand taken by the \\"Advocate\\" during the labor strikes and riots in Milwaukee, in 1881, is said to have saved the Democratic party in Wisconsin from making a serious mistake. Personal life On July 12, 1854, Abbie C. Ballou married Charles D. Robinson (1822‚Äì1886), of Green Bay, Wisconsin. He was the founder and editor of the Green Bay Advocate and for many years one of the controlling minds of Wisconsin in all matters of public polity. He was at one time Secretary of State. She died in 1893 and is buried at Oak Hill Cemetery, Woonsocket, Rhode Island.

Background  Portico Quartet is Portico Quartet's third studio album. The album saw a notable development in style, incorporating significant use of electronics and looping compared to the acoustic sound of their first two albums Knee-Deep in the North Sea and Isla. The group had already been exploring use of electronics, live samples and looping when touring their second album Isla in 2010. This was accelerated when founding member Nick Mulvey left in 2011 to pursue a career as a singer- songwriter. Without their main hang player, the group turned to sampling the hang, as well as using a hybrid mix of electronic and acoustic drums, and electronically treated and looped bowed bass and saxophone lines. The drummer, Duncan Bellamy, explained the new approach for the track Laker Boo in a contemporary interview: ‚ÄúThe twinkly loop that starts it is actually the hang on the loop station but pitched up a couple of octaves and then I pitched the hang down two octaves so the bass notes on that tune are the hang as well. Then Milo is bowing the bass and I was playing the bass drum and the hi hat - then Jack was playing all the samples on the keyboard - because we are now looking for ways to not always have the saxophone, or the sound of the hang, but it's still in there - and that really felt like a breakthrough.‚Äù The artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins.  Critical reception  Portico Quartet received widespread critical acclaim upon its release. In the UK it charted at #98 the week after its release. Many reviewers heralded the album's mix of electronic and acoustic sounds, and its use of texture. Music OMH highlighted how it managed to ‚Äúamalgamate arrangements of modern and traditional instruments to devastating, hypnotic effect‚Äù and All About Jazz praised the ‚Äúgreatly expanded sonic palette and stylistic purview‚Äù. DIY Magazine called it ‚Äúone of the first truly remarkable records of 2012‚Ä¶an album which grabs the zeitgeist but still stays true to its roots: callipygously shuffling, painlessly seguing, mingling the darkest rags ‚Äòn‚Äô bones of dubstep, d ‚Äòn‚Äôb and off-kilter jazz, all the while interweaving heck loads of new-found textures and electronics. It‚Äôs a forward-thinking game-change which feels rich, warm and ‚Äì quite simply ‚Äì astounding‚Äù. Other reviewers highlighted the album's production. Crack Magazine said that ‚ÄúPortico Quartet's subtle musical intricacies combined with production values heralding unrivalled clarity have been meshed in a very modern way to create an album of wonderful proportions and balanced minimalism. Stunning.‚Äù The inclusion of a track with vocals - for the first time ever on a Portico Quartet album - divided opinion, however. The Guardian called it ‚Äúthe best track‚Ä¶a triumph‚Äù, while Music OMH thought it was ‚Äújarring‚Äù. The album came 3rd in Crack Magazine's top 100 albums of 2012 who commented that it was ‚Äúa glorious success in changing direction‚Ä¶less focused on the hang-drum that defined previous releases, the minimal sparse approach and killer production quality left an indelible mark on our listening.‚Äù  Track listing  All songs composed, arranged and performed by Portico Quartet. # Window Seat - 3:18 # Ruins - 5:34 # Spinner - 4:39 # Rubidium - 8:44 # Export to Hot Climates - 1:08 # Laker Boo - 7:51 # Steepless ft.

Haas-Heye headed the fashion department of the Kunstgewerbemuseum in Prinz- Albrecht-Stra√üe 8. He was editor at the Graphische Modebl√§tter. Biography Otto Ludwig Haas-Heye was born in Heidelberg on 16 December 1879 to Hermann Haas (1852‚Äì1902) and Hermanna Helene Heye (1857‚Äì1942). After his parents divorced, Haas-Heye moved with his mother to her birth place Bremen in 1889. He grew up in a Hanseatic patrician atmosphere, attendeding the Gymnasium at first, later the Real-Gymnasium and finally a commercial school. From 1895 to 1899 he studied painting at the Kunstakademie D√ºsseldorf. After a year of volunteering at the Schwere Reiter Regiment in Munich, Haas-Heye continued this artistic training at the Acad√©mie Julian in 1901‚Äì1902. Haas-Heye's father died in 1902, leaving him with a considerable fortune. He moved to Munich that same year, to Rome in 1904, to Paris in 1905 and then continued to travel through Turkey, Egypt, Greece and Albania in 1906. Haas-Heye studied at the Berlin University of the Arts under Arthur Kampf in 1907‚Äì1908. On 12 May 1909, Haas-Heye married with Viktoria Ada Astrid Agnes, Countess of Eulenburg, the youngest daughter of Philipp, Prince of Eulenburg, and a godchild of Augusta Victoria of Schleswig-Holstein. This gave him access to European aristocracy. The couple went to Great Britain in 1910 and from 1912 to 1914 they lived in London and Paris. Together they had three children: , Ottora Maria, and Libertas, (see entry 8d) During his stay in France, Haas-Heye became acquainted with many couturiers, including Paul Poiret. The outbreak of World War I forced him to return to Germany in 1914. =Zeit-Echo= On 22 April 1914, Haas-Heye took over Graphik-Verlag in Munich after selling his shares in the M√ºnchner Zeitung and the Mannheimer Zeitung, cofounded by his father.In M√ºllers Adre√übuch von 1916: Graphik-Verlag G.m.b.H Verlagsbuchhandlung, Kunstverlag, M√ºnchen Gl√ºckstr. 5 und Berlin NW 7, Pariser Platz 7, gegr√ºndet 22.4. 1914, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer: Otto Haas-Heye see Gr√∂tzinger, 1993, p. 88 Haas- Heye moved the publishing house to Max Liebermann's townhouse in Berlin, becoming editor for Zeit-Echo, ein Kriegstagebuch der K√ºnstler (\\"Zeit-Echo, an artist's wartime diary\\", containing prose, poetry, reviews and graphic arts) until December 1916. He worked under editor-in-chief and art director in 1914, followed by editor-in-chief Hans Siemsen in 1915. Ludwig Rubiner took over as editor in 1917. =Fashion career= Haas-Heye also founded a fashion house in 1914. It was housed in the Hatzfeld Palace on Wilhelmplatz in Berlin. Out of protest against the war, he named it \\"Alfred-Marie\\" after a longtime friend in Paris. Haas-Heye was its artistic director until 1916. Through hand-colored prints by Annie Offterdinger (1894‚Äì1987) published by Graphik-Verlag, Haas- Heye made his designs accessible to the general public. During World War I, haute couture from Berlin was regarded as a trend-setting model for German fashion. The younger ladies of the distinguished society were particularly impressed by Haas-Heye's creations. The ladies of the aristocracy, who still held the necessary financial resources, as well as celebrities, now turned to Berlin fashion houses like Gerson, Manheimer, and Alfred-Marie. Haas-Heye was conscripted in April 1916, but was allowed to leave in August, probably due to his father-in-law's relations, through which he could have an audience with Helmuth von Moltke the Younger, Chief of the German General Staff. Later that year, he assisted Hermann Muthesius in setting up the Deutscher Werkbund exhibition in Basel, where he organized a large fashion show, held in 1917 on a self-made stage. He lived in Switzerland until 1919, designing costumes for mime and balls. In 1920, Bruno Paul appointed Haas-Heye as teacher at the , where he founded and the fashion and costume classes, subsequently receiving the title of professor in 1921. From then on he devoted himself to costume design and stage decoration.

Origins Born about 1360, he was the younger son of John Cokayne (died 1372), of Ashbourne in Derbyshire, Chief Steward for the northern half of the Duchy of Lancaster, and his wife Cecily, daughter of Sir William Vernon, of Haddon and Harlaston, and his wife Margaret, daughter of Sir Robert Stopford. After 1372 she married Robert Ireton, of Kirk Ireton. His elder brother Edmund (died 1403) was heir to the family lands and John entered the law. Career By 1394 he had become Recorder of London, holding the post until 1398, and in 1396 was made a serjeant-at-law. From 1398 to 1400 he followed his father as Chief Steward of the Duchy north of the Trent, an appointment by John of Gaunt who named Cokayne as one of the executors of his will. In 1400 he was made a Chief Baron of the Exchequer and in addition, in 1405, a Justice of the Common Pleas. He gave up the Exchequer post in 1413. In 1425 he sat with the Chief Justice, Sir William Babington, on a case over parliamentary expenses brought by the borough of Bedford. It was decided that the expenses of the two MPs representing the town should be borne by all the inhabitants, not just by those on the electoral roll.BOR B/G1/1 10 Feb 1425 He made his will on 10 February 1428, asking to be buried beside his wife in the church of St John at Bury Hatley, and died on 22 May 1429, his will being proved in August.PROB 11/3/212 Will of John Cokayn of Bedfordshire, August 1429 His monument in the church has since been destroyed.

Biography  = Early years = He was the youngest of six children of a working-class family and had three brothers and two sisters. His family lived in Schulstra√üe 17, not far from today's subway station Leopoldplatz. = Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft = When he was a student he met Magnus Hirschfeld after a lecture in Munich around 1918. Later, Giese became an employee in Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft and finally a lover of Hirschfeld. He took over the management of the archive of Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft. Hirschfeld described their relationship as a \\"physical-mental connection\\". Giese also gave lectures, curated exhibitions and wrote articles. During this time, Giese met the British archaeologist Francis Turville-Petre and the French author and later Nobel Prize laureate Andr√© Gide. British-American writer Christopher Isherwood, who lived for some months in the neighboring building, wrote about himself and Karl Giese: Ellen B√¶kgaard, a dentist from Copenhagen and World League for Sexual Reform committee member, describes Giese in her memoirs as \\"woman of the house\\". According to B√¶kgaard, Giese enjoyed decorating the place and doing needlework, as well as looking after Hirschfeld's wardrobe. Karl Giese was interested in theater and acting. He was part of a theater group Theater der Eigenen. Giese also had a role as the young violinist Paul K√∂rner in Richard Oswald's film Different from the Others When Magnus Hirschfeld traveled on world tour in 1930, he entrusted Giese to run the affairs of the institute. = Exile in Paris = Hirschfeld did not return to Germany from his world journey in 1932, and Giese went to meet him in Paris. He found Hirschfeld living with another partner, a 23-year-old Chinese medical student called Li Shiu Tong. Despite some initial jealousy, they all lived together in Paris in a m√©nage √† trois. After the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft in Berlin fell victim to the Nazi Regime with books from its library burned, Giese spent several months in Brno in 1933 trying to purchase surviving literature from the Institut's archives. He also made contact with the magazine, Nov√Ω Hlas: list pro sexu√°ln√≠ reformu (New Voice: Journal of Sexual Reform), arranging the publication of some articles by both Hirschfeld and himself. = Later years = In 1934, Karl Giese was caught having sex with another man in a public bathhouse and sentenced to three months in prison on charges of \\"arousal of public annoyance\\". As a result of his imprisonment, Giese's residence permit was not extended and he was forcibly required to leave France in October 1934. He then went to Vienna and lived there for a year, studying for matriculation exams. Hirschfeld, B√¶kgaard and Norman Haire provided him with money for living and studying. Hirschfeld and other Giese benefactors hoped for him to study medicine in London after completing exams in Vienna. After Hirschfeld's death in 1935, Giese managed to return to Nice for the funeral. Two months before his death, Hirschfeld had named his two lovers, Li Shiu Tong and Karl Giese, as his sole heirs. However, Hirschfeld stipulated in his will that both men use their inheritance for the purposes of sexual science and not for personal use. Karl Giese was awarded the library and the objects that had been saved from the Institut f√ºr Sexualwissenschaft. Eventually he wasn't able to use his inheritance. Norman Haire privately provided Giese with financial help in the hopes he'd settle in Britain as per Hirschfeld's wishes. However, Giese moved to Brno in 1936 and lived with Karel Fein for several months before moving into his own flat. In March 1938 Karl Giese committed suicide in Brno. His heir, the lawyer Karl Fein, was deported and murdered by the Nazi regime in 1942. All of Giese's possessions, including his inheritance from Hirschfeld, have since been lost.

In 2011 VARA and BNN announced that they would merge. On 6 November 2011 the members of VARA voted for the merger, after the member council of BNN had already done so a week earlier. The merger was opposed by the VVD and the Freedom Party. BNN and VARA announced on 8 February 2012 that the decision to merge was definite. On 1 September 2018, existing members of BNN and VARA were converted into members of BNNVARA, thus ending the separate member associations that still existed. Network After the merge, BNN and VARA kept using their separate branding, but on 24 August 2017 it was announced that as a new broadcaster, BNNVARA (formerly BNN-VARA) would start to show programs though VARA, and for radio later the following morning on 28 August. In 2017, controversy arose when the documentary Jesse, about the leader of the GroenLinks party Jesse Klaver, was aired by BNN-VARA.

She was a professor of English and a leader in the temperance movement. Willing wrote several books including From Fifteen to Twenty-five: A Book for Young Men and serials for newspapers. She married a lawyer and Methodist pastor at age 19. In 1873, she and her husband became professors at Illinois Wesleyan University. Willing came to notice when she joined the Illinois Woman's State Temperance Union, serving as its leader for some years. She and Emily Huntington Miller were involved with creating and presiding over the Cleveland convention of 1874 where the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union was formed. She served as the editor of the national organization's journal for a period. In 1895, she created the New York Evangelistic Training School. Early life and education Jennie Fowler was born in 1834 in Burford, Upper Canada. Her parents, Horatio and Harriet (Ryan) Fowler, were of English, Scotch and Irish descent. Her maternal grandmother was disinherited because she chose to share the wilderness perils with an itinerant minister, Henry Ryan. Her father was a Canadian \\"patriot,\\" who lost all in an attempt to secure national independence. He was glad to escape to the States with his life and his family, and to begin life again in the new West. He could give his children little more than a hatred of tyranny, constant industry, careful economy and good morals. Willing fell into a well at the age of two, and had long term health problems. In 1842, the family removed to Newark, Illinois. Here, her brother Charles Henry Fowler, was engaged for a period to Frances E. Willard. She received the honorary university degree of A.M. degree (Evanston College for Ladies, 1872 or 1873). Career Jennie Fowler Willing =Educator, writer= She began teaching school when she was 15 years old. The next year, she finished teaching the winter term of a village school, from which the \\"big boys\\" had \\"turned out\\" their young man teacher. In 1853, at the age of 19, she married William Crossgrove Willing, a Methodist Episcopal Church minister, and went with him to western New York. The many duties of a pastor's wife left small time for study, but she continued to study language and a science. She began to write for the press at the age of 16, and, besides constant contributions to papers and magazines, she produced two serials for New York papers and 10 books. In 1873, she was elected professor of English language and literature in the Illinois Wesleyan University. After that, she was connected as trustee or teacher with several literary institutions. In 1874, she was nominated, with a fair prospect of election, to the superintendency of public instruction in the State of Illinois. On account of other duties, she was obliged to decline the nomination. =Social reformer= Jennie Fowler Willing Her inherited love of reform brought her to the fore when the crusade swept over the United States. For several years, she was president of the Illinois Woman's State Temperance Union. With Miller, she issued the call for the Cleveland convention, and she presided over that body, in which the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union (NWCTU) was organized. She was the first editor of the NWCTU's organ, later titled the Union Signal. Willing was drawn into public speaking by her temperance zeal, and soon she found herself addressing immense audiences in all the large cities of the U.S.. As one of the corresponding secretaries of the Woman's Foreign Missionary Society, she presented the temperance claims at conferences of ministers, and in scores of large towns in different parts of the U.S., interesting thousands of people in its work. Her other roles included superintendent of the NWCTU's Evangelistic Training Department, and president of the Frances Willard WCTU. For several years, she rendered similar service to the Woman's Home Missionary Society. As an evangelist, she held many large and important revival services, and with marked success. After her removal to New York City, in 1889, she was busy with her home mission work, her evangelistic services, her Italian mission and the bureau for immigrants, with its immigrant girls' home, in New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. She was a women's suffrage leader in Illinois. Personal life Willing died a widow in New York City on October 6, 1916, and left her money to charities.\\"Willing, Jennie Fowler (1834‚Äì1916).\\" Women in World History: A Biographical Encyclopedia.

Background  Portico were a band formed by three original members of Portico Quartet. Despite the similarity in name, they considered this to be a new, separate group due to the difference in musical style. While Portico Quartet are known for their jazz-influenced instrumental music, Living Fields is an electronic experimental pop album featuring guest vocal collaborations. The overall themes for the album, both musically and lyrically, were drawn from the 2010 documentary Nostalgia for the Light. The band identified this as a means of unifying the issues that they were themselves facing in their own lives: \\"The film is about ideas of loss and new beginnings, it's about death and ideas of afterlife, it's about history and time, the beginning of the universe, it's about many many things and deep issues. So it's not about the film necessarily but it's more about the themes and it was a good way to get a thread through the whole album\\". The group's musical influences were also thematically tied to the overall concept of the album. They described the music as \\"somewhere between disintegrating ambiance and pop songs\\" and identified Tim Hecker, William Basinski, Actress, and Oneohtrix Point Never as major influences on their sound. The album features guest collaborations with three singers, all of whom the band had a personal connection with: Joe Newman from Alt-J, Jamie Woon, and Jono McCleery. The band sent the documentary Nostalgia for the Light to them to guide their lyrics: \\"We sent that to each of them and each of them seemed to write about a different aspect of what the film kind of evoked in them. Some had ideas about how we are all bound atomically to the universe in a very scientific but also philosophical way. And then other ones wrote about searching for their lost lovers and family, this idea of loss. Others had ideas about the road that we go down on when we pass away\\". Artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins. The front cover image is a sculpture by Henri Gaudier-Brzeska.  Critical reception  Living Fields was generally positively received on its release. It was listed as one of Mojo magazine's top 10 electronica albums of 2015. Several reviewers highlighted the album's atmosphere and textures. The Line of Best Fit wrote that with its \\"Bleeding sounds so that instruments never quite feel entirely synthetic nor material, it's a very British electronic record, with its echoing clatters and restless lack of pattern to tracks [...] brooding throughout, dark by its production and vocals, and its messages\\". It also said that the album \\"achieves that rare feat of giving electronic music a beating heart, and is without a doubt one of the best records of its class this year\\". The Skinny called it \\"A moody, elegant record with flickers of shiny, shiny pop [... it] navigates a tricky path between the purely atmospheric and the distinctly rhythmic\\" and DMCWorld praised the \\"widescreen, cinematic soundscapes that really stretch the music out, wringing maximum tension and emotion from their harmonies...Moody and rather magnificent\\". Some critics however felt that the album lacked energy and did not stand out sufficiently. PopMatters wrote that the album \\"feels lifeless [...] These songs are ethereal to a fault, unable to gain a foothold in memory\\" and MusicOMH said that \\"with their synth textures and post-dubstep influences, they don't sound all that different from much of the pop music being made at the moment\\".

Rasmussen killed at least six people in a crime spree that spanned decades and stretched across the continental United States. Due to his use of many aliases, most notably \\"Bob Evans\\", Rasmussen is known as \\"The Chameleon Killer\\". Rasmussen is the perpetrator of the Bear Brook murders. The bodies of his girlfriend, California woman Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch, her two daughters and his own daughter were discovered in two barrels in Allenstown, New Hampshire, in 1985 and 2000. He had settled in nearby Manchester, New Hampshire, under the alias \\"Bob Evans\\" in the late 1970s. As Evans, he dated Denise Beaudin, who disappeared in 1981. Beaudin's daughter was abducted by Rasmussen and taken to California, where he raised her under the pseudonym \\"Gordon Jensen\\". He abandoned her in 1986 and was subsequently imprisoned on child abandonment charges. After his release, he assumed the name \\"Larry Vanner\\" and married chemist Eunsoon Jun in 2001. He died in prison in 2010 after being convicted of her 2002 murder. Although the Allenstown barrels were discovered during his lifetime, Rasmussen was not named as the culprit until 2017, when DNA profiling connected him to the crime. Subsequent investigations led to Honeychurch and her daughters being identified as three of the four victims found in Allenstown; the identity of the fourth victim, his daughter, remains unknown. Since 2017, he has been named as a suspect in several other crimes. Early life Rasmussen was born on December 23, 1943, in Denver, Colorado. He grew up in Arizona and attended North High School in Phoenix until dropping out during his sophomore year in 1960. Rasmussen enlisted in the United States Navy in 1961 and served until he was discharged in 1967. He married in 1969, had four children and lived with his family in Phoenix and Redwood City, California. His wife left him and took the children in 1975 after he was arrested for aggravated assault. They last saw Rasmussen around December 1975 or 1976, when he showed up with an unidentified woman. The divorce was finalized in 1978. Rasmussen lived in a number of states, including: Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Virginia, Texas, Ohio, Oregon, Hawaii and California. He settled in New Hampshire sometime in the late 1970s. It was reported that he was known to travel with women and children. He often worked as an electrician for oil and gas companies. While living in Manchester, New Hampshire, Rasmussen lived under the alias \\"Robert 'Bob' Evans\\" and worked at the Waumbec Mill. Throughout 1980, he was arrested in Manchester three times for writing a bad check, theft and diverting electric current. A woman named \\"Elizabeth Evans\\" was listed as his wife during his time in New Hampshire; this woman has never been identified. Crimes =Bear Brook murders= By 1978, Rasmussen was dating Marlyse Elizabeth Honeychurch. Honeychurch was last seen in La Puente, California, on Thanksgiving day that year. After an argument with her family, she left with Rasmussen and her two daughters, six-year-old Marie Elizabeth Vaughn and one- year-old Sarah Lynn McWaters. In November 1985, the bodies of Honeychurch and Vaughn were found in a barrel in Bear Brook State Park in Allenstown, New Hampshire. They were found to have died of blunt force trauma to their heads. A second barrel was found about 100 yards from the first one in 2000 containing the body of McWaters and an unidentified child aged between two and four years old. The identities of Honeychurch and her two children were not known until they were confirmed by DNA profiling in 2019. , the third child remains unidentified, but authorities were able to confirm that Rasmussen was her biological father. =Denise Beaudin and Lisa= While using the pseudonym Bob Evans, Rasmussen dated Denise Beaudin, who disappeared from Manchester, New Hampshire, after Thanksgiving of 1981 with her six-month-old daughter. Authorities believe that Rasmussen killed Beaudin somewhere in California, although her body has never been found. Beaudin was not reported missing at the time as her family believed she left town due to financial reasons. Throughout the early 1980s, Rasmussen remained in possession of Beaudin‚Äôs daughter, whom he called Lisa, and posed as her father. He was arrested in Cypress, California, in 1985 under the name Curtis Kimball for charges of driving under the influence and endangering the welfare of a child but failed to appear in court. He then took on the alias Gordon Jenson and abandoned the child at an RV park in Scotts Valley, California, in 1986. Rasmussen was arrested under another alias, Gerry Mockerman, in 1988 for driving a stolen vehicle. In 1989, he received a three-year prison sentence for child abandonment. Under a plea deal, an additional charge of child abuse was dropped. He was paroled in 1990 and subsequently absconded. =Eunsoon Jun= Rasmussen resurfaced in December 1999 under the pseudonym Larry Vanner when California-based chemist Eunsoon Jun introduced him to her family. The two were married in an unofficial ceremony in 2001. Jun disappeared in June 2002 and her body was found buried in cat litter in their home after having died from blunt force trauma to the head. He was arrested that November and pleaded no contest in 2003 to charges relating to her murder and dismemberment. He was sentenced to 15 years to life in jail. The guilty plea came as a surprise to the court and Contra Costa County homicide detective Roxane Gruenheid has stated that she thinks he pleaded guilty after overhearing her say that she was going to request a paternity test for Lisa. A fingerprint match had confirmed that along with Vanner, he had previously used the aliases Jenson and Kimball, linking him to the child abandonment case. In 2003, the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department opened a case to find Lisa's biological family. DNA evidence eventually found that he was not Lisa's father and the case spent years without any significant developments. Rasmussen died while imprisoned at High Desert State Prison on December 28, 2010. His cause of death was a combination of lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and pneumonia. Posthumous findings Reconstructions of the four victims found in Allenstown. The child pictured at the far right, who was Rasmussen's biological daughter, remains unidentified. San Bernardino detective Peter Headley got Lisa's case in 2013 and genealogy website databases had grown since the case had started. Aided by genetic genealogist Barbara Rae-Venter in 2015, Beaudin's daughter discovered her mother's identity and that the man she once thought had been her father was her kidnapper. This linked him to New Hampshire in the same timeframe as the Bear Brooks murders, when he was known as Robert Evans. On January 26, 2017, authorities publicly announced that Evans was a suspect in the disappearance of Denise Beaudin and the Bear Brook murders. Additionally, they announced that DNA confirmed that he was the father of the middle child found in Allenstown but that Evans was a pseudonym and his legal identity was not known. Police released a video of a police interview of Evans in June 2017 in hopes of finding his true identity. Two months later, he was confirmed to be Rasmussen, through Y-DNA testing from a DNA sample contributed by one of his children from what is believed to be his first marriage. The use of genetic genealogy to identify Rasmussen represented new possibilities in forensic investigations. These techniques have since been used in other high-profile cases, including the Golden State Killer case, leading to the arrest of suspect Joseph James DeAngelo in April 2018. New Hampshire investigators announced that the identities of Honeychurch, Vaughn and McWaters were confirmed through DNA testing in June 2019. The identities of the middle child, who Rasmussen fathered, and her mother remain unknown. Investigators believe that the mother of the child was also killed by Rasmussen. Criminologist Jack Levin has stated that Rasmussen is unlike any serial killer he has ever studied, stating: \\"What distinguishes Rasmussen from most serial killers, is that he targeted people with whom he had a relationship. Most serial killers would never do that; it's the last thing they would do. Instead, they focus on complete strangers.\\" He has been dubbed \\"The Chameleon Killer\\" due to his use of various aliases and his crime spree which stretched across the country. Suspect in other crimes Shirt found with the San Joaquin County Jane Doe, who was left in a refrigerator in California in 1995. Rasmussen lived a mile and a half away from 14-year-old Laureen Rahn when she disappeared from Manchester, New Hampshire, in April 1980. Denise Daneault, a 25-year-old woman who lived two blocks from the Rahn residence, went missing from a bar in June 1980. Daneault had been living on the same street as Rasmussen. Police and FBI agents conducted a search in Manchester after receiving an anonymous tip regarding Daneault in November 2017, after Rasmussen was announced as the Bear Brook killer. A second search was conducted in May 2018. By 2020, New Hampshire Senior Assistant Attorney General Jeff Strelzin said there was no \\"evidentiary connection\\" between Daneault and Rasmussen but that the interest in his case brought renewed attention to Daneault's disappearance. Elizabeth Lamotte was 17 years old when she disappeared from the Youth Development Center in Manchester in 1984. She left the group home after receiving a furlough, so she was not reported missing until police were seeking more information on Rasmussen in 2017. At that time, a tipster speculated that she could have been the \\"Elizabeth Evans\\" that had been listed as Rasmussen's wife during his time in Manchester. However, DNA from Lamotte's relatives later proved that she was one of the victims in the Redhead murders, a series of unsolved homicides across the United States which are unrelated to Rasmussen. Lamotte had been found in Tennessee in 1985, killed about four months after her disappearance. When Lisa was interviewed by detectives in 1986, they asked her if she had any siblings. She said that she did but \\"they died eating ‚Äògrass mushrooms‚Äô when they were out camping\\". Her answer led police to believe that Rasmussen killed them too. San Joaquin County, California Assistant Sheriff John Huber speculated that Rasmussen may have been responsible for killing the San Joaquin County Jane Doe. In 1995, the unidentified woman's body was discovered by scavengers inside of a refrigerator which had been dumped in a canal. Like Rasmussen's other victims, she had died of blunt force trauma to the head.

This stepwise elongation allows for complete control of the stereochemistry, as any bis-amino acid can be incorporated to allow for elongation; or any mono-amino acid can be added to terminate a chain. This can be accomplished using either solution-phase or solid-phase reactions. Zachary Z. Brown, Jennifer Alleva, and Christian E. Schafmeister, \\"Solid-Phase Synthesis of Functionalized Bis-Peptides\\" Biopolymers, (2011), 96(5), 578-585 The original synthesis of spiroligomers allowed for functionalization on the ends of the oligomers, but it did not allow for the incorporation of functionality on the interior diketopiperazine (DKP) nitrogens.

Structure Spiroligomers can be synthesized in any direction, and between any pair of bis-amino acids. Spiroligomer diketopiperazines can be created between either end of a bis-amino acid.

Since the Muslim conquests of the 7th century, Cilicia had been a frontier province of the Muslim world and a base for regular raids against the Byzantine provinces in Anatolia. By the middle of the 10th century, the fragmentation of the Abbasid Caliphate and the strengthening of Byzantium under the Macedonian dynasty allowed the Byzantines to gradually take the offensive. Under the soldier-emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (), with the help of the general and future emperor John I Tzimiskes, the Byzantines overcame the resistance of Sayf al-Dawla, who had taken control of the former Abbasid borderlands in northern Syria, and launched a series of aggressive campaigns that in 964‚Äì965 recaptured Cilicia. The successful conquest opened the way for the recovery of Cyprus and Antioch over the next few years, and the eclipse of the Hamdanids as an independent power in the region.  Background  Map of the Hamdanids at their greatest extent under al-Dawla, ca. 955 As of the middle of the tenth century, Byzantium was in the midst of a resurgence. In 961 they had reclaimed Crete from the Muslims and, following the conquest, were prepared to make expeditions against the Arabs in Anatolia. The Emir of Aleppo, and ruler of the Hamdanid dynasty at the time, was Sayf al-Dawla (). A confident and aggressive commander, he executed numerous raids into the Greek heartland, as far as Iconium. After al-Dawla confirmed his rule in Aleppo in 944, he continued the Arab practice of raiding into Byzantine territory, formally resuming war in 945/46. Despite the frequency and effectiveness of his raids in disrupting Byzantine commerce and generally creating chaos on Byzantium's eastern front, al-Dawla's tactics were defensive in nature, and his armies never posed a serious threat to Byzantine domination of Anatolia; contemporary Arab sources claim (indeed perhaps exaggerate) that Byzantium's armies probably outnumbered al-Dawla's by around 70,000.Bianquis (1997), p. 107Whittow (1996), p. 320Kennedy (2004), p. 270 Al- Dawla's Emirate was inherently weak. It lacked any kind of naval presence, as al-Dawla sought actively to avoid any kind of pressure to Byzantium's dominance of the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Meanwhile, the Thughur system of Hamdanid administration was inefficient and ineffective. Adapted from the Byzantine Themata system, from which the name derives, combined with the devastating effects of Byzantium's scorched earth tactics on the populace, the Thugur system left the Hamdanid provinces in destruction and poverty. Al- Dawla's winter raid (945-6) was of little effect, and fighting between the two powers died down for a few years. In 948 and 949 the Byzantines managed two successful invasions of the Hamdanids and sacked Hadath in the first expedition and Marash in the second, even raiding as far as Antioch. In 950 al-Dawla attempted to raid into Byzantine territory, and was crushed by Leo Phokas, losing 8,000 men in the \\"dreadful expedition\\".Treadgold (1997), p. 489 Later the same year al-Dawla again attempted to raid Byzantine territory, rejecting their offers of peace, but was soon forced to retire by the coming of winter. The next year Bardas Phokas launched a failed expedition into Cilicia in an attempt to prevent the Arabs from repairing some strategic fortresses. Two years later Bardas once again tried and failed to invade al- Dawla's Cilicia. The Hamdanids would hold out against two more Byzantine attacks in 954 and 955.Treadgold (1997), p. 492 More serious conflict began in the spring of 956, when al-Dawla began a renewed invasion of Byzantine territory. John Tzimiskes, commanding the Byzantine army, managed to counter by his own invasion of Cilicia, managing to secure a pass in al-Dawla's rear. However, when the two clashed, al-Dawla won decisively, killing 4,000 of Tzimiskes' men. At the same time, Leo Phokas invaded Syria, engaging and defeating al-Dawla's cousin, Abu'l-'Asha'ir. In 957 Nikephorus managed to capture and subsequently raze Hadath, and al-Dawla was unable to respond due to the discovery of a plot against him. From there the tide continued to turn against al-Dawla. In 958, Tzimiskes invaded Arab territory once again, seizing Dara and defeating an army of 10,000 men under al-Dawla's lieutenant Nadja. The next year Leo Phokas managed a raid which extended as far as Cyrrhus.  Call for Jihad  Tensions reached their apex in 960 when al-Dawla declared a Jihad.Romane (2015), pp. 7 He attempted to marshall and consolidate his forces under the call for a holy war perceiving a weakness in Byzantium's defenses following Nicephorus' departure for Crete. Leo soon passed into Muslim territory, avoiding the brunt of al-Dawla's forces and plundering as he went. He waited for the return of the raiding Arab army and soon prepared an ambush for them. Under the Arab general Ali ibn Hamdan, the army was caught completely off-guard by Leo. Its forces were quickly slaughtered and Leo recovered loot of both Byzantine and Arab origin, decisively destroying the army.Romane (2015), pp. 8 The successive loss of these battles began to have more internal effects for al-Dawla, as well as external ones, as his own government began to lose faith in him.Bianquis (1997), pp. 107‚Äì108Treadgold (1997), p. 495 Unfortunately for al-Dawla, Nicephorus now returned victorious from Crete with the majority of the Byzantine army. From 961 to 962, Nicephorus led his armies into Cilicia, quickly taking Anazarbus. Nicephorus retired to Byzantine territory for Easter, 962, and returned in the Autumn in order to drive al-Dawla, who was in Cilicia itself, out of the province. He invaded Arab territory with a 70,000-man strong army, taking Marash, Sisium, Duluk, and Manbij. Nicephorus proceeded to ignore al-Dawl's advance forward and brought his army to Aleppo in mid-December, which he managed to capture and plunder. In 963, war died down between the two powers, as the Byzantine Emperor, Romanus II had recently died, and a brief succession crises was to ensue in which Nicephorus would ascend the throne as Nicephorus II Phocas (). On the Hamdanid end, however, things were less peaceful. Al-Dawla faced rebellion after rebellion, first in 961, carried out by Ibn az-Zayyat, then in 963 by Hibat Allah, and finally in 963-64 by Nadja. A brief Arab raid was countered by Tzimiskes who was appointed Nicephorus' successor upon his ascension. He soon invaded Cilicia, defeated an Arab army, and tried and failed to siege the important fortress of Mopsuestia.Treadgold (1997), p. 499  Final conquest of Cilicia  The Byzantine themes of Asia before the conquest of Cilicia By the time Nicephorus became emperor, after his successful seizure of Crete, he had decided on a grander plan to expand Byzantine territory, rather than merely sack the Arab cities and withdraw. He began his invasion in Autumn 964 and set out with an army of 40,000. He began by spreading out his lighter infantry throughout the Cilician countryside and ordered them to loot and plunder the villages in order to ensure a general atmosphere of confusion and disarray among al-Dawla's administration.Romane (2015), pp. 23 Nicephorus then marched the main segment of his forces, the Imperial Army plus the forces of the themes of Asia Minor, through Arab territory and began to capture major fortresses and cities. He took Adana, Anazarbus, and around twenty other fortified cities. He then marched on to Mopsuestia. Tarsus and Mopsuestia were the two largest remain fortresses in the region. Nicephorus quickly realized, after bombarding the city, that only a prolonged siege would manage to force Mopsuestia to capitulate. Soon, with the coming of winter, Nicephorus retreated to his regional capital of Caesarea, where he passed the season preparing for next year's campaigning season on the sieges of Mopsuestia and Tarsus. At the spring of 965, Nicephorus once again collected his forces and departed for Cilicia. This time, however, Nicephorus headed strait for Tarsus. There he met the garrison outside of the walls of the city and engaged it. He decisively defeated the army and drove them back into the fortress. He then blockaded the city, raided the surrounding countryside and left for Mopsuestia, leaving the city besieged, blockade, and surrounded by destruction and desolation. He began to in turn siege Mopsuestia, bombarding the city with archers and siege engines. He then employed a similar strategy as used in the Siege of Chandax only four years earlier. He instructed his engineers to dig under the city fortifications while the Arabs were distracted and collapse the weakest perceived section of the wall. This worked, and soon the Byzantines began to pour into the city from the destroyed section.Romane (2015), pp. 26 The city was then looted and razed, while Nicephorus deported all of its inhabitants. He then returned to Tarsus where the populace, after hearing of the destruction of Mopsuestia, sought terms with the Greeks. They handed over the city to Nicephorus in exchange for the safe passage of migrants seeking to emigrate to Syria, which he granted. With the capture of these two cities, Cilicia once again came under the suzerainty of Byzantium, and Nicephorus returned to Constantinople.Kennedy (2004), pp. 278‚Äì279Treadgold (1997), pp. 500‚Äì501 It was around this time that on Cyprus the Byzantine general Niketas Chalkoutzes staged a coup. The nature of the circumstances of this coup are dubious due to a lack of sources, but it is clear that the Abbasid authorities had no preconceived notions of it as it was incredibly successful. The island was returned to the Byzantines and reintegrated into the Theme System.Romane (2015), pp. 34, 35  Aftermath  Following the quelling of some civil unrest in the spring of 966, Nicephorus once again set out for the east.Romane (2015), pp. 34 Nicephorus' strategy was not one of traditional Byzantine origin, but combined the tactics used by the Arabs with his own strategy. He largely avoided open confrontation, pillaging, raiding and capturing cities where he could. He marched east with his army from Constantinople, joining up with his new forces as he passed through Byzantine Cilicia, and advanced onto Syria.Romane (2015), pp. 35 Nicephorus soon led his army to Antioch, where he set up a light siege and began to raid the countryside. In the fall of 967, Nicephorus captured many forts in southern Syria, and eventually came to Tripoli. He wished to meet up with his navy there, but the winds and tides were uncooperative and he could not besiege the city, and instead marched north to the fortress of Arqa, which he soon captured and looted. It was around this time in 967 that al-Dawla died. His successor, Sa'd al-Dawla, was a weak and ineffectual ruler, and by the time he ascended the throne, Hamdanid territory had become a mere battlefield on which the Byzantines and Fatimids could settle their disputes. Nicephorus did not cease the pillage of Syria until the spring of 969 when he returned to Constantinople. However, he left a large garrison in a citadel of his construction outside of Antioch in order to maintain the siege.Romane (2015), pp. 36 Around a year later, Byzantine forces retook Antioch and cemented Byzantine control of the region. Romane (2015), pp. 37 Following the loss of Cilicia and Antioch, the Hamdanid state began to deteriorate rapidly. A string of rebellions would fracture and crush the dynasty's power, and the state would barely last to the end of the century before being vassalized and subsequently dissolved by the Fatimid Dynasty of Egypt, which would in turn rise to dominate the Levant and the near east for centuries.Kennedy (2004), pp. 280‚Äì282 Byzantium, on the other hand, would continue to expand under the successive emperors Nicephorus, John II Tzimiskes, and Basil II. In fact, the Byzantines would see nearly unchecked expansion for over a century from the conquests of Cilicia and Antioch, only finally being subdued by the Seljuk Empire at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071.

Background  Isla is Portico Quartet‚Äôs second studio album and the follow-up to Knee-Deep in the North Sea, their Mercury Prize-nominated debut album. The album saw a continuation and refinement of the live acoustic sound developed in Knee-Deep in the North Sea. While those songs were written busking, the songs for Isla were written over a period of four winter months in the band‚Äôs garden shed. Reflecting this the album has a darker, more introspective tone than its predecessor. Songs for the album were recorded in May 2009 at Abbey Road Studio 2. The album was produced by John Leckie. Electronic overdubs and string arrangements were added at Fish Factory Studios. Artwork and design for the album was done by the drummer Duncan Bellamy, who has a degree in Fine Art from Central Saint Martins. The cover is a painting by Bellamy.  Critical reception  Isla received widespread international acclaim upon its release. The Observer highlighted their development in sound and that the album had \\"exceeded the unreasonable expectations prompted by their impressive debut‚Ä¶it is better focused and better executed‚Ä¶genuinely innovative\\". Other reviewers noted the albums darker tone compared to its predecessor. Jazzwise commenting that it was a \\"highly atmospheric album\\" with a \\"haunting sonic texture\\" and \\"brooding ambience\\" that \\"is much more focused in intent\\". The BBC described a \\"deepier, scarier world\\" and Music OMH called it \\"hypnotic, sultry and mesmorising\\". The album was also acclaimed for its fusing of genres. The Washington Post praised this \\"quietly impassioned set of originals that fuse elements of pop, jazz, classical and electronics music‚Ä¶wholly original, 21st century experimentalism that stirs both body and soul\\". Pop Matters wrote that \\"It‚Äôs one thing to crisscross musical genres. It‚Äôs another to make it sound like second nature\\" and Mojo highlighted the albums \\"glorious eclecticism‚Ä¶Isla feeds on Steve Reich mathematics, Radiohead dread, African desert grooves and ECM northern melancholy\\".

Creek and Seminole Indians ceded large tracts of land to the firm as payments for their debts, and the Spanish governor ratified the title. What became known as the Forbes Purchase equaled over 1.4 million acres acquired by Forbes and Company during the period from 1804‚Äì1812, making it the largest land grant in Spanish Florida. In 1817, the Forbes Purchase was sold to two merchants named Carnochan and Mitchel, who later formed the Apalachicola Land Company. In territorial Florida (1821‚Äì1845), the title to land near the Apalachicola River was not settled until 1835, and lawsuits related to land claims in the Florida Panhandle by heirs of Thomas Forbes were contested as late as 1887. The Forbes families Brothers Thomas and John were children of James and Sarah Gordon Forbes, who lived in the County of Banff, Scotland. John was christened on December 20, 1767, near Gamrie, and died in Matanzas, Cuba, on May 13, 1823. Thomas' birth date is not known; he died in 1808. The men had two sisters named Anne and Sophia. Like Thomas and John, Sophia's husband, Alexander Glennie, also worked in trans-Atlantic trade. Genealogical records suggest that John Forbes, though never married, had children with a widow in Mobile, Alabama, named Marie Isabelle Narbonne (1770‚Äì1822). The couple had two children named Sophia Forbes (1797‚Äì1823) and Juana Forbes. A third child named Margaret Forbes is mentioned in genealogies but not confirmed by historical records. The family moved to an estate in Matanzas, Cuba in about 1818, where Forbes ran a sugar mill with his sons-in- law. Marie Narbonne died in 1822. A letter received by James Innerarity states that John Forbes died of dysentery on May 13, 1823 while sailing to New York. Thomas Forbes married Elizabeth Anne Yonge in the Bahamas in 1789 and the couple had four children named William Henry, John Gordon, Mary Sophia and Thomas Irving Forbes. Some of Thomas Forbes' descendants later sued successors to John Forbes and Company to obtain reimbursement for lands that the company originally owned. Colonial export-import companies Thomas Forbes, the older brother, probably arrived in Charleston, South Carolina before the American Revolutionary War and began meeting his future trading partners of Panton, Leslie and Company. His maternal uncle, John Gordon, had arrived around 1760. John Gordon and Company hired William Panton as a clerk in 1765 while importing goods from England that were sold to colonists and traded with the Cherokee and Creek (Muscogee) nations that controlled land west and south of the American colonies. In 1772, Gordon named Panton as one of his attorneys. Another future partner and fellow Scotsman, John Leslie, began trading in the Charleston area before 1779, but primarily did business in British East Florida. Just before John Forbes arrived, all prior companies were dissolved when William Panton, John Leslie, Thomas Forbes, William Alexander and Charles McLatchy formed Panton, Leslie and Company in 1783. The new firm expanded into Florida and came to dominate the Indian trade from St. Augustine to Pensacola. In 1784, John Forbes sailed from Scotland to the Bahamas, where the company maintained wharves and warehouses, and then to St. Augustine, headquarters of the company in East Florida. He was shortly assigned to assist William Panton at the West Florida headquarters and to manage the store in Mobile, West Florida (Alabama did not become a U.S. territory until 1817.) Panton, Leslie and Company and its successors took part in what is called the triangular trade during the colonial period. Basically, manufactured goods from Britain were taken to Africa and traded for slaves. The slaves were taken to the West Indies and American colonies and sold to plantation owners, including some Creek Indian chiefs. Rum, sugar, salt and indigo from the West Indies were taken to the colonies for trade. Other goods, including firearms, gunpowder and lead bullets were exchanged with the Indians in return for deer hides and peltries. Hides, cotton, tobacco, sugar, rum and rice were taken back to England and sold to purchase merchandise for the next round of trade. All of the partners of Panton, Leslie and Company were Scots who remained British loyalists or Tories during the American Revolutionary War. The decision was pragmatic because their trade depended on English manufactured goods. The partners were opposed fiercely by American revolutionaries, and they were declared treasonous by the Committee for Safety in South Carolina. Owing to the hazards of staying in the original colonies, in 1776 the partners moved to St. Augustine, Florida, which remained a haven for loyalists until the British were forced to transfer the territory back to Spain in 1783. William Panton and Thomas Forbes developed a working relationship with the British Governor of Florida, Patrick Tonyn. Their trading firm operated out of East Florida and Nassau in the Bahamas, acquiring trading posts along the St. Mary's and St. Johns rivers and plantations that grew indigo, rice, tobacco and cotton. The firm periodically imported African slaves who worked the plantations or were sold to other owners. Thomas also managed a very successful operation in the Bahamas. When the Revolutionary War concluded, Britain was forced to transfer East and West Florida to Spain. The new governors viewed the Indian trade as a key element in controlling the territory, and soon learned that the Creeks in particular preferred to deal with Panton, Leslie and Company. The partners gained status as agents of the Crown and were granted a near monopoly on trade. Pensacola soon garnered the most business, and Panton, Leslie and Company moved its headquarters from St. Augustine to Pensacola. Creek and Seminole Indian trade A major reason that Panton, Leslie and Company dominated the trade with Creek Indians was the cooperation of a Creek chief (‚Äúmico‚Äù) named Alexander McGillivray. The son of a Scotsman, Lachlan McGillivray, and half-Creek woman named Sehoy Marchand of the Wind clan, Alexander studied in Charleston before the Revolutionary War and worked in a Savannah-based mercantile house. However, he returned to Creek country before the war and became the British commissary. Because American rebels confiscated his lands in Georgia, he remained loyal to Britain, and came to favor trade with Panton, Leslie and Company. In 1783, McGillivray was named a head warrior of the Creek nation. Panton, Leslie & Company established a headquarters in Pensacola, West Florida, and other trading houses in Mobile and St. Marks, Florida from which goods could be carried into Creek and Seminole lands by boat and pack train. Deer hides were the principle item bartered between the Creeks and the trading company, partly because there was strong demand for leather during periods when the cattle plague (Rinderpest) depleted leather stores in Europe. Hides and furs brought in by the Indians were exchanged for woolen goods, cotton and linen cloth, handkerchiefs, leather shoes, saddles and bridles, rifles and muskets, gun flints, bullets, brass and tin kettles, axes, metal pots and pans, scissors, fishhooks, tobacco and pipes. However, gunpowder was always the major item of trade. Indians of the Southeast had begun trading with Spanish, British and French in the 17th century. None of the tribes had developed the ability to manufacture cloth, iron goods, or glass, and firearms became essential not only for procuring deer hides but also for defending tribal lands against rivals and settlers from the American colonies. All of the southeastern Indians became dependent on manufactured goods, and traditional crafts such as the ability to fashion stone-tipped knives and arrows diminished. Like the Cherokee, Creeks took on many practices of European culture, including stable village life with agriculture based on corn, beans, squash, melons and cotton supplemented by raising cattle and hogs. After William Panton's death in 1801, John Leslie returned to London to manage the firm's business. In July, 1803, ‚ÄúJohn Forbes and Company‚Äù appeared on the books, and in 1804, officially replaced Panton, Leslie and Company. During the same period, partners in Florida including John and James Innerarity, interpreter William Hambly and others sought payment from the Indians for bad debts. From 1804 to 1817, John Forbes and Company dominated Indian trade in Spanish Florida even though making a profit was difficult during the War of 1812, the Creek War, and the first Seminole Wars. Spanish authorities, including governor Vicente Folch, defended the company's duty-free status as a way of preventing incursions from American fur traders. James Innerarity and Edmund Doyle opened a new store at Prospect Bluff 20 miles north of the Apalachicola River mouth, and James managed the store in Mobile, which remained in West Florida although the United States claimed it had been part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. John Forbes and Company operated in West Florida under the protection of the Spanish Crown. When the United States annexed Mobile and part of West Florida in 1814, Forbes and his partners, James and John Innerarity, claimed Spanish citizenship by residence, and obtained decrees from the Spanish governor verifying their status. The men adopted Spanish names and probably spoke fluent Spanish. To help affirm Spain's right to possess the territory, \\"Juan Forbes\\" wrote a book in 1804 entitled Descripci√≥n de las Floridas y medios de fomentarlas, which was translated as John Forbes Description of the Spanish Floridas, 1804. Land cessions to the United States Many of the Indian tribes that traded with Panton, Leslie & Company and John Forbes & Company lived on land between the state of Georgia and the Mississippi River. That area had been organized as Mississippi Territory in 1798 after Spain ceded the land to the United States with the Treaty of Madrid, and President Thomas Jefferson was interested in removing Indian tribes as a way to foster settlement of the territory. Benjamin Hawkins, Indian agent in Mississippi Territory, and John McKee, Indian agent in Tennessee, met with John Forbes and discussed using Forbes & Company as an intermediary. Because the Creek (Muscogee), Choctaw, Chickasaw, and Cherokee (with the Seminoles, all were members of the five civilized tribes) owed debts to Forbes & Company, the tribes might agree to cede land in exchange for repayment of the debts by the United States government. The plan was discussed with U.S. General James Wilkinson, who forwarded the idea to Henry Dearborn, the U.S. Secretary of War. In 1804, Forbes set out for Washington to discuss the plan with Secretary Dearborn, taking with him a letter of introduction from General Wilkinson to Secretary of the Treasury, Alexander Hamilton. Forbes & Company negotiated successful agreements with the four tribes in 1805. The U.S. signed separate treaties with each of the tribes, and the land cessions that totaled about 8,000,000 acres were approved between 1805 and 1814. The Creeks ceded land in Georgia between the Oconee and Ocmulgee rivers, the Choctaw ceded land between the Alabama and Pearl rivers, and the Chickasaw and Cherokee ceded holdings north of the Tennessee river. The United States paid Forbes & Company over $77,000 for their services. The Forbes land grants Land ceded by the Seminoles and Lower Creeks to John Forbes & Company in 1804-1811 became known as the Forbes Purchase. The grants comprised 1.4 million acres of land on the Gulf of Mexico between the Apalachicola and Wakulla Rivers in West Florida. Even after his negotiations on behalf of the United States, John Forbes insisted that the Lower Creeks and Seminoles owed his company a large debt due to their participation with William Augustus Bowles in two robberies of the trading post on the Wakulla River in 1792 and 1800. The company had also issued credit to members of several tribes, including Creeks, Choctaws and Chickasaws, and claimed a total of over $192,000 was due to be repaid. Forbes sailed for London after John Leslie's death in 1803 to register the name change from Panton, Leslie and Company to John Forbes and Company. Meanwhile, his partners, James and John Innerarity and William Hambly, negotiated with 24 Creek and Seminole chiefs for land cessions as payment. Between 1804 and 1811, the company collected most of the debt, being paid when the tribes ceded land to the company, with approval of the Spanish governor Vicente Folch y Juan. The transfer of land between the Apalachicola River and Wakulla River to the company became known as Forbes Grant I or the Forbes Purchase. It contained over 1.4 million acres that ran from the barrier islands of Apalachicola Bay to the Upper Sweetwater Creek in present-day Liberty and Leon Counties. The Creek Indians had agreed to grant Forbes & Company their land only if the firm would establish a trading post on the Apalachicola River. In 1804, James Innerarity and Edmund Doyle built a post at Prospect Bluff, about 20 miles north of the river mouth. The trading post included a building for storing hides, quarters for Negro slaves, and a cow pen for several hundred cattle that were raised nearby. During the War of 1812, British troops looted the store and freed the slaves. Losses during the war later caused the company to petition the Spanish governor for a second land grant, later known as Innerarity's Claim or Forbes grant II. The second claim contained 1.2 million acres west of the Apalachicola River, but was overturned in Florida courts in 1830 when future Florida governor, Richard K. Call, learned that the cession took place too late to be valid. When it was not possible to restore profitable trade after the War of 1812‚Äì1814, Forbes decided to sell the land in Forbes Grant I. Probably foreseeing that Spain and the United States would negotiate a treaty that would jeopardize his claims, he sold the property to two merchants named Carnochan and Mitchel in 1817. Future lawsuits related to the land would principally involve them and James Innerarity, who still owned about 40,000 acres of the grant. Heirs of the partners continued to file lawsuits until their claim was denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 1906 in United States vs. Dalcour. After John Forbes' departure, James and John Innerarity continued managing John Forbes and Company for several years, but sales were primarily with American settlers rather than Creek Indians. In 1830, John Innerarity purchased the remaining company assets in Pensacola, retired from the firm and closed the Pensacola store. The company's claim to land west of the Apalachicola River was denied by the courts, and their remaining Indian clients were forced to move west of the Mississippi River as a result of the Indian Removal Act of 1830. James continued managing the firm from Mobile, but John Forbes & Company came to an end when he died in 1847. Carnochan, Mitchel and Company James Innerarity (left; 1777‚Äì1847) and his brother John (right; 1783‚Äì1854) took control of Forbes & Company after John Forbes retired in 1817. Both men became prominent U.S. citizens and lived in Pensacola or Mobile for most of their lives. John Forbes had attempted to generate a profit for his firm by selling land to settlers. He also had attempted to secure direct payments of cash or land from the Spanish Crown, but neither of these strategies was fruitful. In December, 1817, John Forbes sold most of the lands his company had acquired east of the Apalachicola River for $66,666 to two merchants from Savannah and Cuba named Richard Carnochan and Colin Mitchel. He and his partners held about 25,000 acres in reserve, including Forbes Island in the Apalachicola River. An initial payment was to be made in London in 1818, and the balance of $50,000 was to be settled through annual installments. That balance was to be paid through mortgages that Forbes and his partners never received. The lands of the Forbes Purchase were conveyed to Carnochan and Mitchel in the same year that John Quincy Adams and Luis de On√≠s began negotiating terms under which Spain ceded Florida to the United States. The emissaries signed the Adams‚ÄìOn√≠s Treaty in 1819 and it was ratified in 1821. Nominally, Spanish land grants made before January 24, 1818 were supposed to be lawful, but had to be validated through territorial or federal courts. The mechanism to secure title for large grants such as the Forbes Purchase was not set up by the U.S. Congress until 1828. After the sale of the land, John Forbes gradually retired from company business, and he died in Cuba in 1823, leaving future disputes about inheritances to Carnochan and Mitchel, James Innerarity, and numerous heirs who believed that they had never received their promised inheritance when Panton, Leslie and Company and Forbes and Company disbanded. The Apalachicola Land Company The first American settlers who moved into the territorial Florida Panhandle occupied what they considered unclaimed public land, but often was part of the Forbes grant. For example, Major Charles I. Jenkins, a U.S. customs collector in the District of Apalachicola, built a customs house on the west side of the Apalachicola River mouth. He was joined at the place called Cottonton or West Point by other squatters on land claimed by Forbes' successors. The validity of Colin Mitchel and his partners' claim to the title of the Forbes Purchase could not be verified immediately. The partners laid out a settlement called Colinton near their former trading post several miles north on the river, but most newcomers bypassed the town and built homes near the customs house at West Point. In 1821, James Grant Forbes (no relation to John Forbes) included a map of Colinton and a description of the Forbes Purchase in his book about East Florida. Although the land had a vast reserve of virgin forest, most of the area was not suitable for farming or manufacturing. In 1828, the U.S. Congress permitted claimants of Spanish land grants to file suits in federal courts, and Mitchel and partners petitioned the U.S. District Court to validate their claim. Their petition was denied in 1830, and the associates appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. In the last decision taken by Chief Justice John Marshall, the court ruled in favor of Mitchel and partners in 1835. The partners reorganized as the Apalachicola Land Company, planning to raise funds by selling land and lots in the town that had been renamed Apalachicola, Florida in 1831. Immediately after the favorable decision, the company hired Asa Hartfield to survey the area in an attempt to provide documentation that could validate land titles. The initial sale of lots in Apalachicola raised $443,800, but later sales declined. An 1835 deed recorded in Leon County, Florida, shows Thomas Baltzell, future Florida supreme court justice, as the President of the Apalachicola Land Co. Leon Co. Deed Book E Future disposition of lands in the Forbes Purchase never was straightforward. Some residents purchased lots and built homes. Others founded a new town called St. Joseph on land that was not included in the Forbes Purchase, roughly 20 miles northwest next to a deep-water harbor on St. Joseph's Bay (see St. Joseph, Gulf County, Florida). Most residents moved back to Apalachicola after a yellow fever epidemic in 1841 depopulated the town. The Apalachicola Land Company continued attempting to sell land from 1835 up to the American Civil War. However, land sales never materialized, and without sufficient income, the company was forced to pay its debts and taxes by ceding land to its creditors. In addition, heirs of Thomas Forbes felt that they had been cheated of their inheritance, and filed a lawsuit in 1851. In 1855, John Beard was appointed as receiver for the company, and attempted to auction off the properties. He yielded his position to George Hawkins in 1866. Most of the land was sold for a few cents an acre. The Apalachicola Land Company ceased to exist, and years of litigation were required to settle titles to the land and barrier islands near Apalachicola. Forbes Purchase and Florida county boundaries When citizens of Apalachicola moved to St. Joseph outside of the Forbes Purchase in 1835, they petitioned the Territorial Legislative Council to become the county seat of Franklin County. Although the petition was denied, a new county called Calhoun was split off from Franklin County and Washington County in 1838. The western Forbes boundary became the county line between Calhoun and Franklin, and persists to this day as the boundary between Franklin and modern Gulf County. The western border between Franklin County and Calhoun (modern Gulf) County follows the border of the Forbes Purchase (red arrow). Likewise, Liberty County was formed from Franklin and Gadsden Counties partly to separate lands in the original Forbes Purchase from public lands (yellow arrow). The red dotted line approximates the outline of the Forbes Purchase. When the heirs of Thomas Forbes sued the Apalachicola Land Company in 1851, residents who lived in Gadsden County in the northern part of the Forbes Purchase feared that they could lose title to their lands or face new taxes. The county representative suggested dividing Gadsden in two, with Liberty County in the southern central area containing most of the land from the Forbes Purchase. In 1855, Liberty County was formed by taking sections from Gadsden and Franklin counties. Gulf County was formed from Calhoun County in 1922 and follows the boundary of the Forbes Purchase. As a result, the Forbes Purchase continued to influence Florida boundaries and property sales long after the dispute was settled in 1887.

It was originally identified as a photooxidized derivative of the amino acid tryptophan and suggested to be the endogenous liagand of the AhR.  Occurrence  FICZ can be found in any solution, including cell culture media, containing the amino acid tryptophan, especially if exposed to Ultraviolet light or visible light. In human keratinocyte (HaCaT) cells treated with Trp and thereafter irradiated with UVB formation of intracellular FICZ could also be demonstrated. In a similar way FICZ has also been identified and quantified in Jurkat cells incubated in tL- Trp enriched medium. FICZ was first identified in humans as sulfogonjugates Sulfation, a type of metabolites of FICZ, by use of liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) (LC/MS/MS) Liquid chromatography‚Äìmass spectrometry. FICZ has been identified in the skin of persons with the disease vitiligo Vitiligo. and in extracts of skin originating from patients with the Malassezia-associated diseases Seborrhoeic dermatitis (SD) or Pityriasis versicolor (PV). Malassezia yeasts are commensal microorganisms found on the skin on many animals including humans. When the yeast stain Malassezia furfur is cultured on agar containing Trp as the only nitrogen source it produces a variety of indole derivatives some of which activate AhR e.g. FICZ. The gastrointestinal tract is a rich source of microorganisms and a favorable environment for formation of indoles and indole derivatives. Although FICZ itself has not yet been identified in mouse cecum extract or fecal pellets other indole derivatives that are precursors of FICZ e.g. indole-3-pyruvate and tryptamine have been found .  Biosynthesis and mechanisms of formation  Microbiota both on human skin and in the gut can convert Trp to several metabolites, some of which with an affinity for the AHR. In the first report on the structure elucidation of the Trp photo-oxidation product FICZ indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A) was suggested to be a precursor of FICZ In addition to the light or H2O2-induced formation of FICZ, a number of other enzymatic pathways have been identified to convert Trp to FICZ via the precursor indole-3-acetaldehyde (I3A). The oxidation product of I3A is indole-3 acetic acid, the most common natural plant hormone auxin Auxin. Decarboxylation of Trp catalyzed by the enzyme aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase (AADC) yields tryptamine, while decarboxylation of 5-hydroxy- Trp, by the same enzyme also (called DOPA decarboxylase) gives serotonin.Serotonin Tryptamine is then oxidatively deaminated by monoamine oxidases MAO-A and B) Monoamine oxidase to produce the FICZ precursor I3A. Post incubation after deamination of the reaction mixture in the absence of an active enzyme generate FICZ but also its oxidation product CICZ. These non- enzymatic reactions were favored by low pH or increased temperatur. This diagram shows three different biosynthesis pathways generating the high affinity endogenous AHR ligand 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole FICZ  Chemical syntheses  The indolo[3,2-b]carbazoles have been intensely studied as synthetic targets due to their diverse biological effects numerous applications in materials chemistry. The double Fischer indolization for the synthesis of the parent system indolo[3,2-b]carbazole was first reported by Robinson 1963 and has since been applied for the synthesis of FICZ and related structures. A more practical chemical synthesis of FICZ has been reported by Zhang et al. (2019) using readily available and commercially obtainable starting materials such as 1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indole and 1-(phenylsulfonyl)-1H-indole-3-carbaldehyde. In order to reach gram amounts in the multistep synthesis of this low solubility ring-closed carbazole (FICZ) the final purification by column chromatography was replaced by a crystallization step instead.  AHR-binding and gene induction When the high-affinity AHR ligand FICZ binds to the receptor, which is a ligand dependent transcription factor activation of many target genes takes place. The most well-studied of these target genes is the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 1A1 Cytochrome P450. The CYPS are a superfamily of enzymes involved in the metabolism of large number of both endogenous and exogenous compounds. The first chemical compound to be recognized as a high affinity AHR ligand was 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, TCDD. The CYP-induction by TCDD is sustained while the induction by FICZ is transient because of its rapid metabolic degradation by CYP1A1. Various effects of the AHR and FICZ in cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have also been described. Moreover, it is generally believed that sustained AHR activation can be prooncogenic, dysregulating key physiological processes and thereby influencing tumor initiation, promotion, and progression, as well as metastasis in a cell-type specific manner.  Metabolism In a first analysis of the metabolism of FICZ S9 fractions prepared from mouse Hepa-1 cells were used. Three HPLC fractions representing FICZ metabolites were occurring with time in the treated S9 derived from the wild type cells while no metabolites were detected in the CYP1A1-deficient cells. In the further analyses of the CYP1A1 derived metabolites two monohydroxylated FICZ metabolites (2-hydroxyindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6-carboxaldehyde and 8-hydroxyindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6-carboxaldehyde) and three dihydroxylated metabolites 2,8-, 2,10-, and 4,8-dihydroxyindolo[3,2-b]carbazole-6-carboxaldehyde respectively, were identified by LC-MS and NMR spectroscopy Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopyand the chemical structure of the metabolites were confirmed by chemical analyses. Kinetic studies using human recombinant CYP1A1, -1A2, and -1B1 expressed in E. coli showed that the catalytic efficiencies (kcat/Km) Specificity constant were found to be 5‚Äì50-fold higher for FICZ than for the standard substrates 7-ethoxyresorufin and 7-metoxyrsorufin and at least 5000-fold higher compared with the hydroxylation of estrogens. CYP1A1 catalyzed hydroxylation of FICZ extremely efficiently, with kcat/Km of 8.1x107 M-1 s-1. The catalytic efficiency for FICZ as a CYP1A1 substrate is close to the limit of diffusion, thus FICZ is an excellent CYP1A1 substrate, but is also a very good substrate for CYP1A2 and CYP1B1. The mono- and di- hydroxylated metabolites of FICZ are subject to further metabolic changes to glucuronide- and sulfate-conjugates. Sulfotransferase (SULT) catalyzed reactions resulted in a more pronounced reduction of the hydroxylated FICZ metabolites than the glucuronidation. Further studies using human recombinant SULTs showed that SULT1A1, -1A2, -1B1 and -1E1 exhibited high catalytic efficiencies and 2-hydroxylated FICZ was more efficiently conjugated than the 8-hydroxylated FICZ. With a kcat/Km of 1.1 107 M-1 s-1 with 2-OH-FICZ as substrate SULT1A2 exhibited a higher values than for any other substrate. Also dihydroxylated FICZ metabolites are converted to disulfuric acid esters but at a slower rate with intermediate formation of monosulfoconjugates, one of which was identified in human urine.  The FICZ/AHR/CYP1A1 feedback loop  Already in the 1980s Daniel Nebert and coworkers proposed that a feedback loop involving an endogenous AHR ligand that is also a substrate for CYP1A1regulates this signaling. FICZ also has the capacity to inhibit CYP1A1 activity, but the inhibition is transient since FICZ is such an exceptionally good substrate for the CYP1A1 enzyme. There are several substances, both exogenous and endogenous, which can inhibit CYP1A1 leading to an accumulation of FICZ in the cell and a subsequent activation of the AHR and induction of CYP1A1.This feedback system is essential for the physiological function of the AHR signaling, since the AHR regulates the balance between the quiescence and proliferation of a large number of cells, such as intra-thymic progenitor cells, as well as hematopoietic, pulmonary, and neuro-epithelial stem cells.  Physiological functions mediated by FICZ  = Self-renewal and differentiation of stem/progenitor cells = The AHR seems to play important roles in normal embryonic development and a reversible repression of the receptor is essential for the maintenance of the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells (ESC). It has been shown that expansion of early progenitor murine hematopoietic stem cells is promoted by down-regulation of AHR signaling through the RNA-binding protein Musashi-2 and 250 nM FICZ reversed this effect.Furthermore, expansion of human induced pluripotent stem cells was enhanced by the AHR inhibitor CH223191 and blocked by FICZ.In contrast, by applying a novel, pluripotent stem-cell based in vitro culture system Smith et al. demonstrated that the potent AhR ligand FICZ resulted in an exponential expansion (600-fold increase) of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC)-derived hematopoietic progenitor cell (HP) populations. Furthermore, FICZ treatment for extended periods of time (60 days) resulted in a progressive erythroid specification and maturation of the HP cells. In addition, ex vivo treatment of rat hepatic progenitor cells with 1-100nM FICZ led to both sustained AHR activation and triggering of cell proliferation. Various effects of the AHR and FICZ in cancer cells and cancer stem cells (CSCs) have also been described. Moreover, it is generally believed that sustained AHR activation can be prooncogenic, dysregulating key physiological processes and thereby influencing tumor initiation, promotion, and progression, as well as metastasis in a cell-type specific manner.Treatment of breast cancer cells with 500nM FICZ, for instance, has been shown to increase aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 (ALDH1) a marker for CSCs in adult cancers and 100nM FICZ treatment of head and neck squamous carcinoma cell lines did up-regulate several growth factors. On the other hand, did FICZ cause cell cycle and proliferation arrest in colon cancer cells, as well as inhibition of tumor growth in mice implanted with T-cell lymphoma or B16 melanoma cells. Stockinger and coworkers demonstrated the importance of CYP1A1 for the endogenous availability of FICZ. Th17 cells from mice expressing CYP1A1 constitutively metabolized FICZ rapidly and responded with lower production of IL-22 when treated with 0.01nM FICZ compared to wildtype Th17 cells. Metabolic clearance of FICZ in mice that overexpress Cyp1a1 in the gut epithelium led to a pseudo-AHR-deficient state and when infected with Citrobacter rodentium, these animals exhibited markedly reduced numbers of group 3 ILCs and Th17 cells and succumbed rapidly. = Immune responses and differences in immune cells = The AHR is involved in the regulation of T helper 17 cell (Th17) and regulatory T cell (Treg) differentiation, which is of importance for the treatment of autoimmunity, infections and cancer. The initial set of experiments indicated a ligand specificity in the response, i.e. AHR activation by TCDD induced functional Treg cells, while activation by FICZ boosted Th17 cell differentiation. In later studies, however, no such effects were found and it was confirmed that only the dose and duration of AHR activation by the high-affinity ligands are the primary drivers of T cell differentiation. AHR activation by FICZ can promote the development of Th17 cells causing inflammation and autoimmunity, but also promote an expansion of the Treg cell population and thereby stimulate immunosuppressive activity.Taking rapid metabolic degradation of FICZ into account, there seems to be no intrinsic difference in the effects of FICZ and TCDD on T cell differentiation and T cell-mediated adaptive immune responses. Similarly, FICZ can stimulate or inhibit cytokine production and the maturation and homeostasis of Mastcells in vitro, as well as anaphylactic responses in vivo, depending on the dose and timing of exposure. = Effects of FICZ on immune barriers = The AHR is highly expressed in cells of the immune barrier organs, such as skin, lung, gut, and mucosal epithelia, as well as in the placenta. The intestinal epithelium is a relatively impermeable physical and immunological barrier. Intestinal epithelial cells participate in the inflammatory and immune responses when activated by interleukin 22 (IL-22). Innate lymphoid cells seem to be one dominant endogenous sours of IL-22.AHR- deficient mice have fewer intestinal IELs and ILCs and therefore a reduced expression of IL-22 and do not survive an infection by the intestinal pathogen Citrobacter rodentium. It has been found that in wildtype mice, FICZ increased the production of IL-22 by the ILCs.Daily i.p. injections of 100 mg kg-1 FICZ to adult mice dramatically reduced their mortality following infection with the intestinal pathogen Listeria monocytogenes.Stockinger and coworkers demonstrated the importance of CYP1A1 for the endogenous availability of FICZ. Th17 cells from mice expressing CYP1A1 constitutively metabolized FICZ rapidly and responded with lower production of IL-22 when treated with 0.01nM FICZ compared to wildtype Th17 cells. Metabolic clearance of FICZ in mice that overexpress Cyp1a1 in the gut epithelium led to a pseudo-AHR-deficient state and when infected with Citrobacter rodentium, these animals exhibited markedly reduced numbers of group 3 ILCs and Th17 cells and succumbed rapidly. Conversely, mice lacking CYP1A1 or when CYP1A1 is inhibited results in an elevate level of endogenous FICZ and conversely, mice lacking CYP1A1 or with inhibited CYP1A1 activity show elevated levels of endogenous FICZ and increased protection against intestinal infection. The composition of the murine commensal microbiota influences susceptibility to gastrointestinal infections and induced colitis and specific components of this microbiota promote the production of AHR ligands resulting in protection against intestinal damage induced by dextran sulfate sodium (DSS). Lamas and co- workers have shown that mice with dysbiotic microbiota due to their lack of the caspase recruitment domain 9 (CARD9) produced lower levels of endogenous AHR agonists and recovered more poorly from DSS-induced colitis. When 1 ¬µg FICZ was injected i.p. one day after DSS administration, the severity of colitis in these animals was reduced significantly. Also, the effects of defects in the colonic expression of IL-22 and genes coding for antimicrobial proteins in Card9 KO mice could be reversed by FICZ. Administration of AhR agonists in different animal models of colitis has underscored the role of AhR in gut inflammation. After FICZ treatment, the severity of different types of induced colitis in mice significantly decreased, characterized by the down- regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and production of IL-22. Moreover, administration of anti-IL-22 prevented the anti-inflammatory effect of FICZ, demonstrating that the therapeutic effect of FICZ at least is partially mediated by IL- 22. The effect of AhR ligands in reversing inflammatory responses has also been demonstrated in a clinical setting. FICZ treatment of lamina propria mononuclear cells from Crohn‚Äôs disease patients resulted in decreased IFN-Œ≥ expression and up-regulation of IL-22. FICZ is also involved in the physiological regulation of Th2-mediated immunity in the lung. FICZ markedly inhibited the lipopolysaccharide- and ovalbumin-induced proliferation of T cells. FICZ likewise suppresses pulmonary Th2-type cytokine production in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic asthma. The key roles played by dynamic AHR signaling in skin immunity have been emphasized by Stockinger and coworkers (Di Meglio et al. 2014). When full-thickness biopsies from the lesional skin of patients with psoriasis was exposed to FICZ, 29 genes belonging to the psoriasis transcriptome were down-regulated. A later murine study confirmed that FICZ decreased IL-17 expression and lessened the severity of psoriasis. Similarly, FICZ and AHR may be involved in the etiology of cutaneous systemic lupus erythematosus and atopic dermatitis. There are also evidence for an important physiological role for FICZ in the expression of IL-22 in the skin. The uptake of Trp and intracellular accumulation of FICZ in skin Œ≥Œ¥ T cells is regulated by the activation marker CD69 in combination with the aromatic-amino-acid-transporter complex LAT1-CD98. These results revealed the importance of Trp uptake for AHR dependent secretion of IL-22 by Œ≥Œ¥ T cells during the development of psoriasis.  The toxicity of FICZ  Several findings indicate that high levels of FICZ can exert ROS-dependent toxicity, whereas low doses can transiently elevate local levels ROS/Ca2+, thereby promoting cellular adaptation, survival, and proliferation. FICZ has proven to be potently embryotoxic toward fish and birds. Zebrafish embryos demonstrated a dramatically increased mortality and severe toxicity, however only when CYP1A1 was inhibited.FICZ can also act as a nanomolar photosensitizer potentiating UVA-induced oxidative stress irrespective of AHR ligand.

When forgiveness is used to create a false sense of superiority it is a toxic act.\\" Music video The music video for \\"Forgiveness\\" was directed by Lindsey Mann. It is a dark, lo-fi video in which Glass writes the lyrics to the song in lipstick across various mirrors, before smudging the words at the end. Those scenes are interspersed with footage of her playing live with her band, and being mostly submerged in a pool of water. Glass said the video was shot at her house, and that \\"it was originally just going to be a lyrics video with me writing in lipstick on mirrors but then we drank too much tequila and filmed more fun stuff.\\" References Category:2018 singles Category:2017 songs Category:Alice Glass songs Category:Loma Vista Recordings singles Category:Songs written by Atticus Ross ","title":"Forgiveness (Alice Glass song)"},{"id":"54959777","text":"Mangelia subcircularis is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Mangeliidae.

In the fall of 1849, Bonaini became acquainted with Johann Friedrich B√∂hmer, an important member of the Central Management of the German Historical Monument (MGH) and famous publisher of the Regesta Imperii, who went to Florence to carry out archive research on the documents Imperial, urged him to accept the request of the Tuscan government for his intervention in favor of the reorganization of the Florentine archives. From 1856 he was the Chief of the Archives of Tuscany, and could thus contribute to the reorganization of both the Florentine (1852‚Äì55) and Tuscan archives, thanks also to the contribution of notable collaborators such as Cesare Guasti, Salvatore Bongi, Giovanni Sforza.

Life  Yun Ko Eun is her pen name and her real name is Ko Eun-ju. She was born in 1980 in Seoul, South Korea. She studied creative writing at Dongguk University. She made her literary debut in 2004 when she won the 2nd Daesan Collegiate Literary Prize. In 2008, she won the 13th Hankyoreh Literary Award for her novel Mujungryeok jeunghugun (Î¨¥Ï§ëÎ†•Ï¶ùÌõÑÍµ∞ The Zero G Syndrome). She has published three short story collections: Irinyong siktak (1Ïù∏Ïö© ÏãùÌÉÅ Table for One), Aloha (ÏïåÎ°úÌïò Aloha), and Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo (ÎäôÏùÄ Ï∞®ÏôÄ ÌûàÏπòÌïòÏù¥Ïª§ The Old Car and Hitchhiker)‚Äîand the novel Bamui yeohaengjadeul (Î∞§Ïùò Ïó¨ÌñâÏûêÎì§ Travelers of the Night). Despite having chosen to major in creative writing, she aspired to be a television writer or journalist during her time at Dongguk University. Prior to her literary debut, she ran a blog on which she posted short travelogues or entries about her everyday life. Now she uses the blog (http://blog.naver.com/shellmaker) as a platform to interact with readers. For several years following her graduation, Yun took on various jobs including tutoring, writing for an in-house periodical, and creating educational material for children, yet she did not write any fiction even though she had already won the Daesan Collegiate Literary Prize. Then at one point she formed a writers club with old friends from Dongguk University. Two years later, she won the 13th Hankyoreh Literary Award with Mujungryeok jeunghugun. In 2016, she participated in the Overseas Translation Workshop Program held by MCST and LTI Korea at the National Institute for Oriental Languages and Civilizations (INALCO) in France. She has named Kenji Maruyama and Martin Page as her favorite authors outside of Korea.  Writing  Mujungryeok jeunghugun, Yun Ko-eun's first breakthrough novel, begins with the following sentence: \\"Loneliness is the best Viagra.\\" Literary critic Do Jeong-il and writers Hwang Sok-yong and Kim Insuk, who judged the Hankyoreh Literary Award and selected Mujungryeok jeunghugun as the winning work, critiqued that it \\"figuratively and humorously depicts the sense of alienation people feel in today's society. The weight of their alienation is portrayed lightly, and the intensity of their pains cheerfully.\\" In the novel, the moon splits into two, then four, and finally into six moons one day, like a planarian. The strange phenomenon plunges people on Earth into chaos, stoking their lunar fantasies, apocalyptic fears, or desire to earn profit from these moons. Yun says she conceived the idea of splitting and multiplying moons when she was at a convenience store purchasing a bun that looked like a full moon. Then she took the idea and expanded it into a novel \\"like the leavening of bread.\\" Literary critic Gang Ji-hui says \\"Yun Ko-eun seems to have earned a reputation for distorting reality with whimsical imagination.\\" On Yun's narrative structure, Gang notes: \\"The characters in Yun Ko-eun's novels typically follow a curve that starts from zero, increases in entropy as some imaginative event unfolds, hits peak levels, and falls back down to zero.\\" Such characteristics are also evident in Yun's 2016 short story collection Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo (ÎäôÏùÄ Ï∞®ÏôÄ ÌûàÏπòÌïòÏù¥Ïª§ The Old Car and Hitchhiker). A review summarizes the collection as follows: \\"Yun Ko-eun's third short story collection Neulgeun chawa hichihaikeo consists of eight stories that bring readers to the boundaries between reality and imagination. Some of these stories tip the scales toward the side of imagination: \\"Y-ray\\" is about a 'y-ray' machine, a defective product manufactured in an x-ray machine factory, that goes on to diagnose certain individuals as potential dissidents who must be shunned from society; \\"Bultaneun jakpum\\" (Î∂àÌÉÄÎäî ÏûëÌíà Burning Works of Art) involves a residency program that invites artists to create artwork over six months, exhibits their completed works once, then burns them up; \\"Daokjeong chilbeonji\\" (Îã§Ïò•Ï†ï 7Î≤àÏßÄ Daokjeong Number 7) presumes that 1930s Korean writer Park Taewon comes back from the dead in 21st-century Seoul and guides tourists around the places in which his novel is set.\\" (The novel mentioned here refers to Park Taewon's A Day in the Life of Kubo the Novelist). Despite their fantastical nature, Yun Ko-eun's stories do not lead readers to a state of actual zero gravity, but to an illusion of it, as the term \\"Zero G Syndrome\\" indicates. The illusion is born from the imagination and desires of people whose lives are firmly grounded in reality.

Along with his younger brother, Pierre Curie, he studied pyroelectricity in the 1880s, leading to their discovery of some of the mechanisms behind piezoelectricity. He is buried in the Saint-Lazare cemetery in Montpellier.  Biography  In 1883, Jacques Curie was appointed professor of mineralogy at the University of Montpellier. This appointment marked the end of his collaboration with his brother Pierre. He remained in Montpellier until his death in 1941 with the exception of the years 1887‚Äì1889, which he spent in Algeria, teaching at the School of Science of Algiers and conducting his research. It was not until 1903 that he was appointed to the chair of physics, a position he retained until his retirement in 1925. His daughter Evelyne married Jacques de Hauteclocque, the first cousin of Marshal Leclerc. His son Maurice Curie was a physicist.  Research and discoveries  The major legacy of Jacques Curie is the discovery of the piezoelectric effect with his brother Pierre in 1880. The two brothers were then laboratory assistants at the Faculty of Sciences of Paris, under the direction of Charles Friedel. The accounts of their discovery generally give Jacques Curie only a minor role in favor of his brother Pierre. Doubtless the comparison between the latter's brilliant career and the more quiet one of Jacques gives some reason for this, however there is no evidence that Jacques was limited to a minor role: In particular he had more experience than his brother in the study of pyroelectricity. In fact it is almost impossible to clearly separate the contributions of the two brothers as they constantly shared their ideas. According to Shaul Katzir, one must consider the discovery as a joint contribution. The Curie‚Äìvon Schweidler law refers to the response of dielectric material to the step input of a direct current (DC) voltage first observed by Jacques Curie and Egon Ritter von Schweidler.

He was mainly a portrait artist. After training in Antwerp he spent in the early 17th century a decade in Genoa where he was a successful portrait painter. He returned to Flanders where he worked in Brussels as a portrait painter to the Governors of the Habsburg Netherlands Archduke Albert and the Infanta Isabella.Guilliam van Deynum at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life  Guilliam van Deynum was born around 1575 in Antwerp. He is believed to be identical with the Gilliam van Deynen (or van Deynum) who was registered in the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke in 1596. The name of his teacher is not recorded.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 385, on Google books He had a brother called Antoni (or Antoon) who was a pupil of Frans Francken the Elder in 1595 and became a master of the Guild in the guild year 1616-1617.De liggeren en andere historische archieven der Antwerpsche sint Lucasgilde Volume 2, by Ph. Rombouts and Th. van Lerius, Antwerp, 1864, p. 388 and 536, on Google books Portrait of a nobleman Van Deynum arrived in Genoa in 1602 in the company of two brothers, one of whom was the Antoni mentioned earlier and another of whom the name has not been preserved.Piero Boccardo, Feste e intrattenimenti in giardino fra XVI e XVII secolo, Silvana Editore, p. 35 He must have achieved success early on as he painted a portrait of the local doge Agostino Doria sitting on a throne with his family not long after his arrival.Piero Boccardo, El Siglo de los Genoveses: e una lunga storia di arte e splendori nel Palazzo dei Dogi, C. Di Fabio, Raffaella Besta, Electa, 1999, p. 324 It is known that he was the victim of an assault in 1606 and that in 1607 he was imprisoned for non- payment in a case concerning his activity as an art dealer. The Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress (Palazzo Bianco, Genoa) dated 1610 is the latest dated painting attributed to the period of his residence in Genoa.Francesco Rossi, Van Deynen, Guilliam in: Dictionnaire des peintres belges He is believed to have remained in Genoa until 1613.Anna Orlando, Van Deyen Guilliam (1575-1618), Ritratto di dama con collana di perle at Aste Boetto Between 1613 and 1614 he is documented in Brussels when the Archdukes Albert and Isabella commissioned two miniatures with their weapons and scenes of the 'Circumcision' and the 'Resurrection'. These works were sent on 10 May 1614 to Philip II, Duke of Stettin and Pomerania, who had requested these works in May 1613. On 20 May 1614, 10 days after the miniatures were delivered, van Deynum formally entered the service of the Archdukes and was named an illuminator of the Brussels court. After some time van Deynum came into conflict with the Brussels Guild of Saint Luke. As long as he solely worked for the Archdukes he was free from the local Guild requirements. However, once he started to work for private patrons, the Guild protested and the Guild's deacon fined van Deynum. Van Deynum refused to pay and was then sued before the Magistrate's court. The court requested he either join the Guild or cease to work as an artist. He appealed the verdict to the Council of Brabant, which confirmed the court's ruling. He then took his case to the Archdukes who supported him. By letters executed in Ghent on 31 July 1618 they exempted him from the obligation to join the painter's Guild and relieved him of all his obligations towards the Guild. Van Deynum is documented working on private commissions for Charles d'Arenberg and Anne de Croy in Enghien around 1614-1617. He collaborated with Servaes de Coulx and Jacob van der Laemen on the Adoration of the Magi (Enghien, convent of the Capuchins). His contribution to this work was probably limited to the portraits in the background. Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress The last mention of his work at the court of Brussels is in the year 1624. It is not known when or where he died. Work The known oeuvre of van Deynum is limited to about 10 works. Van Deynum painted portraits and history paintings. Due to confusion with the still life painter G. van Deynum, some still lifes have erroneously been attributed to the artist. He was an oil on canvas painter as well as a miniature painter and illuminator who worked with gouache on parchment.Flemish School, c. 1610-15, Archduchess Isabella and Archduke Albert in a horse-drawn sleigh on the Grote Markt of Brussels, the town hall beyond at Christie's The work of the artist is still not very well studied and understood. The signed and dated Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress (1610, Palazzo Bianco, Genoa) plays an important role in identifying his oeuvre. The Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress of 1610 shows his work to be strongly linked to the forms of expression of the end of the 16th century and to closely follow the cold and impersonal approach of Frans Pourbus the Elder. His style of portrait painting is situated in the so-called international style of painting. At the time van Deynum painted the Portrait of a Genovese lady in a black dress in Genoa, the city was in a period of transition, during which, before the arrival of Anthony van Dyck in 1621, he and other Flemish artists introduced a form of delicate and sincere naturalism in the rigid late 16th century schemes. Apart from three female portraits and one male portrait given to the artist, the best known works of the artist are a miniature representing The doge Agostino Doria sitting on a throne with his family (private collection) and a painting depicting Archduke of Austria and Isabella of Austria at a reception ball in Genoa (private collection).A. Orlando, Dal North in Genoa, Flemish-Genoese painting in the 17th century, Genoa and Atlantic Europe, by P. Boccardo and C. Di Fabio, Genoa 2006, pp. 187-189 The doge Agostino Doria sitting on a throne with his family The portrait of doge Agostino Doria and his family of 1604 was likely painted for the private use of the doge as Genoese law did not allow the doges to commission public pictures of themselves to show off their achievements. The painting shows in the foreground the doge, his wife and their four children sitting on a large terrace next to a classicizing building, and offering in the back a view over the Ligurian coastline. Behind three columns in the back, six other figures appear to be peering in at the doge's family. They include on the left the doge's nephew and the painter van Deynum himself and on the right two bearded guards with halberds. There is also a bearded black African man dressed in a green outfit with white collar and lace trimming. The face appears to be the likeness of a particular individual. It is not clear what the role of this figure is. He is likely not a guard nor a page. It is not clear whether he is linked to the character dressed in a gaudy red outfit with a large ruffed collar and moronic grin next to him. They could be court entertainers, but the expression of the African man seems to be too serious for this.[http://dubois.fas.harvard.edu/sites/all/files/Kongo%20Ambassadors.pdf Paul Kaplan, Kongo Ambassadors, Papal Politics and Italian Images of Black Africans in the Early 1600s, on 29 October 2008 in Cambridge, MA Archduke of Austria and Margaret of Austria at a reception ball in Genoa The painting of the Archduke of Austria and Isabella of Austria at a reception ball in Genoa was painted in collaboration with his brother Antoni. The painting consists of two planes: on the foreground is shown a lively gathering of elegantly dressed people in distinctive poses while in the back there is a wide landscape occupying three quarters of the composition. On the mountain in the distance a profile of Genoa is depicted.Fausta Franchini Guelfi, Alessandro Magnasco, Galerie Canesso, 11 July 2017, p. 88 It is possible that Guilliam was responsible for the portraits, which are very delicately rendered with a lot of detail while the collar and other parts which do not display the same lightness of touch were executed by Antoni.

Description Syncrossus beauforti resembles Syncrossus berdmorei but has 11-14 dorsal fin rays as opposed to 9‚Äì10 in S. berdmorei. Tn both species there are rows of small, dark spots running along the length of the body and the head, but in S. beauforti these markings are a slightly smaller and it has 9-12 faint vertical bars on its body. As the fish matures bars may fade leaving the longitudinal rows of dark markings. The dorsal fin has a black margin and 3 rows of spots, while the caudal fin has several vertical rows of spots. When excited, these fish are able to produce clicking sounds. They grow to a maximum length of 25 cm standard length. Distribution Syncrossus beauforti is found in south-east Asia and the species was originally described from specimens taken in a stream in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province in southern Thailand and was then recorded in Trang Province and has now been found to occur in the basin of the Salween River on the borders between Thailand and Myanmar and the Chao Phraya River system in western and central Thailand. Records from the Mekong are now attributed to two separate species, S, yunnanensis and S. formosanus which may be synonyms of Syncrossus lucasbahi.Kottelat, M. (2012): Conspectus cobitidum: an inventory of the loaches of the world (Teleostei: Cypriniformes: Cobitoidei). The Raffles Bulletin of Zoology, Supplement No. 26: 1-199. Habitat and Ecology Syncrossus beauforti occurs in the demersal zone of small and medium-sized rivers and it is habitually associated with streams which clear and fast flowing with a stony or rocky substrate, with large amounts of wood debris and leaf litter. It may enter flooded forest during the high-water periods during the monsoon and returns to the rivers during November and December. It digs burrows in sand or excavates them under rocks. It is omnivorous with the bulk of its diet being made up of insect larvae and benthic animals. Species in the genus Syncrossus are sociable and are known to form dominance hierarchies within social groups and to undertake ritualised behaviours to determine their place in the hierarchy. These fish possess sharp sub-ocular spines which they can move, these are normally hidden inside a pouch of skin but when the fish is stressed it can erect these spines. In addition they make sounds when excited but the purpose of the sounds is unknown. Human Use and Conservation Syncrossus beauforti is sometimes recorded in fish markets being sold for human consumption. It is an aquarium fish but it has not been known to have been bred in captivity so all of the individuals traded are assumed to have been caught in the wild. The taking of specimens for this trade appears to be the principal threat to this species. It is also threatened by pollution and by the damming of the rivers it occurs in which may prevent the fish from migrating to its spawning areas during the periods of flooding, as well as increasing sedimentation and causing habitat degradation. The population is thought to be decreasing but the population size and extent of the decline is unknown.

The cathedral wealth expanded during the 13th and 14th centuries, with bishops imposing taxes on the locals. Moreover, no one was able to fish or hunt near the lands of the cathedral without the bishop's consent. Revenues were also collected from local hot springs which were believed to have medicinal value. Nonetheless, by the late 14th century, Greenland began its years of decline.

He graduated from the University in 1871, receiving a doctorate in chemical and philosophical sciences. After university, he studies agriculture in the German cities of Hoffenheim and Halle. From 1878 to 1879 he studied winemaking in France, where he met winegrower Jean Baptiste Camus. In 1880, Sarajishvili returned to Tiflis and settled in the house of his parents on Sergievskaya. In May 1880, his father died and left a legacy of 700 thousand rubles. In the fall of 1880, Sarajishvili married Ekaterina Ivanovna Porakishvili. They did not have children. Sarajishvili House on Sergievskaya Street In 1884-85, Sarajishvili laid the foundation for the construction of the future Tbilisi Cognac Factory, which opened in 1888. In 1885, Sarajishvili, together with his father-in-law Ivan Porakishvili, created the Kizlyar Brandy Factory. Also in 1885 in Tiflis on Olginskaya Street (now - Merab Kostavy Street), Sarajishvili built a distillation plant for the distillation of fruit and grape vodka. In 1887, he opened a distillery in Tiflis. In 1894 he opened a factory in Yerevan, in 1895 in Kalaras, and in 1896 in Baku. He also owned a vodka distillery in Vladikavkaz. Sarajishvili was the first to start producing cognac at his enterprises in the Russian Empire by keeping grape spirit in barrels of Caucasian mountain oak. The enterprises of Sarajishvili occupied an almost monopoly position in the Russian Empire. The total production in 1890 was almost 218 thousand bottles, and in 1910 it was 600 thousand bottles. In 1902, Sarajishvili destroyed his parents' house on Sergievskaya Street and temporarily moved to the house number 3 on Freylenskaya Street (now Sulkhan-Saba Orbeliani Street). The architect of the new building project, the construction of which was completed in 1905, was the German architect Karl Zaar. For achievements in the production of alcoholic beverages, Sarajishvili received the title of \\"Advisor for Commerce\\", and in 1913 his company received the title of \\"Supplier of His Imperial Majesty's Court\\". In recent years, Sarajishvili was seriously ill - he was diagnosed with cancer. He issued his deathbed testament notarized in Rostov-on-Don. He died on June 20, 1911. The funeral commission was supervised by Valerian Gunia. The requiem prayer took place in the temple of Sioni. One of those who spoke at the funeral procession was the poet Akaki Tsereteli. Sarajishvili's body was buried on the Didube Pantheon. In 1938, the dust of the couple was moved to a new location in Vake. By the initiative of the founder and president of the Sarajishvili joint-stock company, Guji Bubuteishvili, in 1995, the remains of David Sarajishvili and Ekaterina Porakishvili were reburied near the Kashveti church.  Charity  David Sarajishvili was engaged in charity, supported many famous Georgian artists and musicians. Sarajishvili was the initiator of the creation of a committee chaired by Niko Tskhvedadze, who was engaged in financing talented young people and granted scholarships for education in Russia and abroad. Among the Sarajishvili scholarship holders were the composers Zakhary Paliashvili, Dimitri Arakishvili, Meliton Balanchivadze, Kote Potskhverashvili, Ia Kargareteli; artists Gigo Gabashvili, Moses Toidze, Grigol Meskhi; sculptor Iakob Nikoladze; singers Vano Sarajishvili, Valerian Kashakashvili; scientist Filippo Gogichashvili; future Georgian patriarch Callistrat. Sponsored archaeological excavations led by Ekvtime Takaishvili. Sarajishvili was also the patron of the construction of the building of the noble school (now - Tbilisi State University). He assisted Georgian social democrats, in particular in 1910, according to the police department, allocated a monthly stipend of 150 rubles to Noe Zhordania policy.

He is currently based in Berlin, Germany.  Early life  Shapira was born in Petah Tikva, Israel and raised in the Israeli settlement of Oranit located in the Seam Zone. Shapira's maternal grandfather was the only Holocaust survivor in his family. Shapira's paternal grandfather, Amitzur Shapira, was an Israeli sprinter and a coach for the Israeli track and field team at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich, Germany. He was murdered by Palestinian terrorists in the Munich massacre. In 2002, Shapira immigrated with his mother and younger brother to Germany. The family took residence in the small town of Laucha in the German state of Saxony-Anhalt. With the Neo-Nazi party (NPD) reaching its statewide highest outcome of 13.55% in 2009's local elections, Shapira described the town as an \\"eastern German NPD-Stronghold\\". In 2010, Shapira's younger brother was physically attacked and called a \\"Jewish pig\\" by a right-wing extremist. On New Year's Eve 2014, Shapira was attacked by a group of men after asking them to stop singing anti-Semitic songs on the subway and refusing to delete a video he recorded, showing the men singing \\"fuck Jews, fuck Israel\\" in the middle of the crowded train. The incident was covered by numerous news outlets around the world with Shapira getting the media's attention for refusing to let his case be exploited by right-wing populists to stir up hatred against Muslims.  Work  After New Year's Eve 2014 events, Shapira wrote an autobiographical book about his youth in Israel and Germany, the hostage- taking and murder of his paternal grandfather and the story of his maternal grandfather's survival through the Holocaust. The book was in Germany's Der Spiegel Bestseller list. In 2015, Shapira launched the \\"90's Boiler Room\\" ‚Äì a parody of the global online music broadcasting platform Boiler Room. It was his first project to gain international attention. Shapira replaced the soundtrack of the live music sessions with 90s-era pop hits by Dr. Alban, N*SYNC and the Backstreet Boys. The parody videos gained millions of views on YouTube and Facebook. In early 2017, Shapira launched the controversial online art project \\"Yolocaust\\", combining selfies from the Berlin Holocaust Memorial with footage from Nazi extermination camps. After noticing numerous instances on social media sites such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Tinder and Grindr of people posting smiling selfies with the memorial as a backdrop, and photos of themselves doing yoga or otherwise jumping or dancing on the memorial's stone slabs, Shapira decided to ironically point out the jarring disconnect of taking such inappropriately cheerful pictures in such a somber setting. The project gained worldwide attention, a video about the project by the online news channel AJ+ was viewed 78 million times on Facebook. In August 2017, Shapira sprayed 30 homophobic, Islamophobic, anti-Semitic and racist tweets outside Twitter's German headquarters in Hamburg after the social network failed to remove the offensive hate posts from its platform. Explaining his project, named \\"#HeyTwitter\\", in a YouTube video, Shapira claimed to having reported around 300 tweets to the company within six months, receiving only nine responses from the company, each rejecting the suggestion that the tweets were a violation of the company's terms of service. After the majority of tweets were not removed, Shapira used washable chalk-spray to take the hateful tweets into the real world and confront Twitter, gaining worldwide attention to his project and Twitter's hate speech policies. In September 2017, in collaboration with the satirical political party Die PARTEI, Shapira took control of a number of far-right Facebook groups, including several used by high-ranking members of the Alternative for Germany party. The former admins were locked out, the groups were made public and then renamed to, among others \\"I <3 Antifa\\" and \\"Hummus-Liebe\\".

Language Gooniyandi with Bunuba is one of the two languages of the Bunuban language family. Country Gooniyandi traditional land stretched over some from Fitzroy Crossing in the west to Margaret River Stations 150 miles to the east. Their heartland lay north around the limestone enclaves of the Wunaamin Miliwundi Ranges and around Stony river. Norman Tindale states that their territory encompassed also Bohemia Down, the Ramsay, Sandstone, Mueller, Burramundy, and Geikie Ranges. According to their tradition, they also had a native purchase on the plains on the northern side of Christmas Creek before the advent of whites, but had lost this area to the Walmadjari. Social organization Gooniyandi society is divided into 8 subsections (gooroo), each divided into male and female classes. * (M) jawalyi A1 = B1 jagadda :(F) nyawajaddi A1= B1 nagadda * (M) jawangari A2 = B2 jambiyindi :(F) nawangari A2 = B2 nambiyandi * (M) joowooddoo CI =DI jawandi :(F) nyawooddoo CI =D1 nyawana * (M) jangala C2 = D2 joonggoodda :(F) nangala C2 = D2 nyanyjili Ecology and economy The Gooniyandi comprised numweouas inland foraging bands, each harvesting the rich resources, of reptiles, crustaceans and fish to be found along their water courses. They had three distinct terms for the types of territory their land covered. Though basically riverine dwellers, shifting around pools, springs and rivers in what they called walibiri lands (river country), they also ventured over pindiri or plains of scrub-land (ti:winji) and forested zones (ke'rede (trees)) to hunt for kangaroos. A third term was ka:waro, denoting the mountainous areas where the euro could be found. Labour was gendered, with men hunting game, which included bustards, echidnas and emu, while the women gathered vegetables, honey and such protein foodstuffs as witchetty grubs and frogs. The Fitzroy Crossing Gooniyandi were ideally placed to be intermediaries in northwest trade, which they called tjirdi or wirnandi. The crossing was a strategic transit point for trading goods that were passed on over vast distances. They would exchange with southern tribes manufactured goods from the northwest and east like tjimbila, bifaced pressure-flaked stone knives for rites like circumcision and also used for spear blades. Shellware collected by the Djaui of the Sunday Islands, and bartered with the Warwa and Nyigina in exchange for spears, would in turn be traded by these tribes to the Bunuba and Gooniyandi, who called them tjakuli. These tjakuli trade goods were used in exchanges with the Gija people and the Djaru. Many such objects from the Djaui would eventually end up among the Western Desert tribes. History of contact After Alexander Forrest had, in 1879, surveyed Gooniyandi lands, and wrote a glowing account of their potential for development, they began to be selected for pastoral leases in the late 1880s, when pastoralists began to \\"open up\\" the Fitzroy River area to establish cattle and sheep stations.

The Song of Scorpions had its world premiere at the 70th Locarno Film Festival in Locarno, Switzerland on August 9, 2017. Plot According to an ancient myth, the sting of a scorpion in Jaisalmer, Rajasthan can cause death in less than 24 hours and the only cure is the song sung by a scorpion singer which counters the poison of the scorpion. The Song of Scorpions is the story of a tribal woman Nooran (Golshifteh Farahani) who takes lessons from her grandmother Zubaida (Waheeda Rehman) so as to become a scorpion singer like her. After being struck by a tragedy and snubbed by the people of her village, Nooran is offered a marriage proposal by Aadam (Irrfan Khan), a camel trader who has been in love with Nooran ever since he heard her voice. But soon after getting married, Nooran receives another setback which sets her on a path of vengeance to redeem all the misdoings that were inflicted upon her.

Reception =Critical response= Gautaman Bhaskaran of The Hindustani Times rated the film highly, saying \\"The Song of Scorpions is a story set on the undulating golden sands of the Thar Desert in Rajasthan, the sights and sounds of the mesmeric atmosphere caught most imaginatively by cinematographer Pietro Zuercher. I was bowled over by the light and shade contrasts he presents - the harshness of the daytime desert rubbing shoulders with the darkness of a night illuminated by the light of a million stars, twinkling away and guiding Singh‚Äôs folktale narrated through pain, pathos, love, humiliation, revenge, pardon and forgiveness. I think Singh has this unique ability to fathom the human mind, and in a way, his plot resembles a Shakespearean drama - sans the drama.\\" Boyd van Hoeij of The Hollywood Reporter commended the cinematography of the film saying that, \\"The film is absolutely gorgeous to look at, with Swiss cinematographers Pietro Zuercher and Carlotta Holy-Steinemann relishing the opportunity to film a country that looks so unlike their own\\".\\" Allan Hunter of Screen Daily praised the cinematography, direction and acting performances in the film saying that, \\"Although leisurely in places, The Song Of Scorpions retains its grip, especially as we grow more involved in Nooran‚Äôs refusal to become a victim and her response to the many challenges placed in her path.

The site began as a religious campground and local cemetery for the area's Presbyterian congregation; a church was added to the site in 1906. In 1838‚Äì39, when the Trail of Tears passed through Illinois, Cherokee who were removed from their homeland used the site as a campground. The campground included two springs, which were used as a source of fresh water for the Cherokee and their animals, and a gristmill run by local landowner George Hileman. In addition, several Cherokee children are buried in unmarked graves in the cemetery; the Trail of Tears was deadly for many of those who were forced to travel it, and children were among the most common victims. It is suspected that Hileman allowed the Cherokee to bury their dead in the local cemetery out of sympathy, as his own sons had died recently, though he may have also done so out of a sense of obligation toward fellow Christians.

The company began offering delivery services in Philadelphia before moving into other cities, including Seattle, Boston, Phoenix, and Atlanta. In 2016, goPuff raised $8.25 million in A round funding. In 2019, the company reportedly raised $750 million in funding from SoftBank, with a commitment for up to $250 million more. Also in 2019, goPuff opened a new headquarters in the Finnigan's Wake building in Northern Liberties. Gola and Ilishayev were included in a 2017 Forbes 30 Under 30 list for retail and ecommerce and later in the year, were together named Target Magazine's target marketer of the year.

Adams stated that she preferred to intercept Italian signals as Italians were often excitable when transmitting which lead them to make mistakes causing them to repeat their messages, and thereby giving her a second chance to capture their messages. Having signed the Official Secrets Act, Adams did not talk to anyone, not even her husband, about her work during the war. When MI6 officer Frederick Winterbotham published his book The Ultra Secret in 1974, she then felt able to mention her work. Adams married Bob Adams, an accountant, in 1950. They had three children, Bob, David and Lorna. After the war Adams trained as a radiographer at Manchester Royal Infirmary. After her children were born she worked as a volunteer at the Citizens' Advice Bureau, going on to work as trainer and tutor at its Edinburgh offices. In 2009 Adams was presented with the Bletchley Park Commemorative Badge in recognition of her role during the war. In later life she suffered from Alzheimer's disease and was cared for at a nursing home. She died on 12 July 2010.

The film stars Samuel L. Jackson, Jessie T. Usher, and Richard Roundtree. It is the fifth film in the Shaft series and a direct sequel to the 2000 film with the same title. The film was released theatrically in the United States on June 14, 2019 by Warner Bros. Pictures, and digitally in international markets on June 28, 2019 by Netflix. It received mixed reviews from critics and underperformed at the box office.  Plot  In 1989, NYPD Detective John Shaft II, his wife Maya, and his infant son John \\"JJ\\" Shaft III survive an assassination attempt by drug lord Pierro \\"Gordito\\" Carrera. Concerned that Shaft's lifestyle will put them in danger, Maya moves upstate and raises JJ on her own. Twenty-five years later, Shaft has quit the NYPD to become a PI and JJ is a rookie FBI analyst and cybersecurity expert with a degree from MIT. After Karim, his childhood friend and former US Army soldier, is said to have died because of a heroin overdose, JJ concludes he must have been murdered. JJ travels to Harlem to investigate Manuel, the drug dealer who sold the heroin that Karim allegedly bought, but is violently ejected from his property. While being treated for a minor injury in the hospital by doctor Sasha, JJ's other childhood friend and his unrequited crush, he shows her Karim's toxicology report. She notes that the amount of heroin in Karim's system would have killed him long before he could have taken that much by himself, suggesting that he was indeed murdered. With no other recourse, JJ turns to his father for aid. Shaft agrees to help after realizing that JJ's case may lead him to Gordito. The two begin investigating together, but JJ's progressive white collar outlook on life clashes with Shaft's old-school street ways. After confronting Manuel, the Shafts investigate \\"Brothers Watching Brothers\\", the drug rehab clinic Karim helped create with fellow ex-soldiers Cutworth, Williams and Dominguez. There they learn that Karim stopped going to rehab in favor of attending services at a mosque currently under suspicion by the FBI for terrorism. Sasha accompanies JJ and Shaft to investigate the mosque, where they are removed from the premises after the imam notices JJ's FBI badge. After Shaft convinces JJ and Sasha to plan a dinner together, the two Shafts investigate a convenience store owned by a woman named Bennie Rodriguez who donated $500,000 to the mosque. Maya calls JJ to inform him that she is coming to New York City to meet a man for dinner; she is overheard and later followed by Shaft. The Shafts, each at separate restaurants, survive assassination attempts orchestrated by Bennie. Maya forces Shaft to kick JJ out of the investigation for his own safety. JJ turns over the evidence they have gathered to the FBI, who arrest the mosque's imam. However, the media accuses the FBI of islamophobia, and JJ's boss Vietti fires him. JJ returns to Shaft and overhears a conversation about Gordito, leading him to believe that his father was stringing him along the entire time. While Shaft visits and reconciles with Maya, JJ and Sasha track down Bennie to an abandoned warehouse and learn that \\"Brothers Watching Brothers\\" is a front for a drug smuggling ring; Karim was killed by Cutworth when he threatened to blow the whistle on their operation. JJ gets discovered by the smugglers; Sasha is kidnapped while JJ is rescued by Shaft. Shaft introduces JJ to his grandfather, John Shaft Sr., where they acquire more firepower, and Shaft Sr. decides to accompany them in an assault on Gordito's penthouse. The Shafts kill the drug smugglers while JJ has an intense fight with Cutworth and kills him, avenging Karim's death. He rescues Sasha before being confronted at gunpoint by Gordito. Gordito attempts to shoot JJ to spite Shaft, but Shaft takes the bullet and shoots Gordito, causing him to crash through a window and fall to his death, before collapsing himself. In the aftermath, Shaft recovers at the hospital, with Maya's support. At the insistence of Shaft Sr., JJ and Sasha kiss and finally begin a relationship. Vietti soon offers JJ a promotion to field agent, but JJ turns it down in favor of joining his father and grandfather in their PI business and at the end, the three generations of Shafts walk away together.

Club, Ignatiy Vishnevetsky gave the film a C, writing, \\"With its groaner jokes and TV-pilot production values, the new film makes the last attempt at updating the character to contemporary action-hero tastes (in 2000's Shaft, directed by the late John Singleton) look downright old-school.

He served as a professor at the University of Rochester from 1985 until his retirement in 2011, serving as department chair from 1994 to 1996. During his tenure as the department chair, the University of Rochester experienced severe financial challenges which led to significant restructuring entitled the Rochester Renaissance Plan. In November 1995, the mathematics department was told by the University of Rochester administration that the doctoral program was slated for removal and that the departmental faculty slated for significant downsizing, and admissions to the University of Rochester doctoral program in Mathematics were suspended. This decision led to the involvement of the American Mathematical Society, who passed a resolution urging Rochester to reconsider and formed a task force (chaired by Arthur Jaffe) to address the issue. After a fact-finding committee organized by Neisendorfer sent their report to the university administration, the doctoral program in mathematics was restored.

He was probably the best horse sired by the ill-fated Shergar, winning at the highest level in both Ireland and Australia. He was unraced as a two-year-old but won four of his five races as a three-year-old in 1986, culminating in an emphatic victory in the Irish St. Leger. After failing to reproduce his best form in 1987, he was set to race in Australia where he recorded major wins in the Queen Elizabeth Stakes and Underwood Stakes. After his retirement from racing he stood as a breeding stallion in Japan but had little success as a sire of winners. Background Authaal was a bay stallion with a broad white blaze and three white socks bred in Kentucky by the Swettenham Stud. He came from the first and only crop of foals sired by Shergar who won The Derby, Irish Derby and the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 1981. Shergar was kidnapped from his owner's stud farm in 1983 and never seen again: it is generally believed that he was killed by his captors who were members of the Provisional IRA. Authaal's dam Galletto was a successful racemare who won the Galtres Stakes in 1977 and was a daughter of the Irish Oaks winner Gaia. Authaal was the only one of his sire's first crop to be put up for auction as a foal in 1983 and was sold for 325,000 guineas. A year later at the Goffs sale, he broke the European record for a yearling when he was bought for 3.1 million guineas by the bloodstock agent Tote Cherry- Downes on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed. The colt was sent into training with David O'Brien. Racing career =1986: three-year-old season= Authaal did not race as a two-year-old and did not appear as a three-year-old in 1986 until July, when he won a maiden race over one and a half miles at Leopardstown Racecourse. He followed up despite being dropped in distance in early August when he won a minor race over nine furlongs at Phoenix Park Racecourse. Later that month, he was stepped up in class and sent to England for the Group Two Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse. Ridden by Christy Roche, he led for most of the way but was outpaced in the closing stages and finished last of the seven runners behind the Paul Cole-trained Nisnas. He returned to Ireland for a minor race over one and a half miles at Naas Racecourse in September and won by four lengths from Bank Step. Christy Roche was again in the saddle when Authaal contested the Irish St. Leger over one and three quarter miles at the Curragh on 12 October. The 1985 winner Leading Counsel started 6/4 joint-favourite alongside the British-trained filly I Want To Be (winner of the Meld Stakes), with the French mare Faburola (Prix Kergorlay) next in the betting and Authaal the 8/1 fourth choice. The other two runners went off at odds of 50/1. With the other six jockeys apparently intent on restraining their mounts, Roche sent Authaal into the lead and opened up a lead of fifteen lengths. Although his pursuers steadily reduced his margin of superiority in the straight, the colt never looked in any danger of defeat and won by five lengths from Faburola. In the official International Classification for 1986, Authaal was given a rating of 125, making him the top-rated three-year-old in Europe over 14 furlongs and beyond. The Independent Timeform organisation gave him a rating of 118?, with the \\"?\\" indicating that the rating was based on \\"inadequate or unsatisfactory data\\". In their annual Racehorses of 1986 Timeform explained that they could not be sure of the extent to which the wide margin of Authaal's win in the Irish St. Leger was the result of Roche's bold tactics. =1987: four-year-old season= On his first appearance as a four-year-old, Authaal finished unplaced over ten furlongs and was then sent to Royal Ascot to contest the Ascot Gold Cup over two and a half miles on 18 June. He went off at odds of 9/1 and finished tailed-off last of the eight runners behind Paean. =1988: five-year-old season= In 1988, Authaal was sent to race in Australia where he was trained by Colin Hayes. He finished third to Ostensible in the Neville Sellwood Stakes in March and then contested the Group 1 Queen Elizabeth Stakes over 1800 metres at Randwick Racecourse on 4 April. Ridden by Darren Beadman he started at odds of 3.25/1 and won from Ostensible. After the winter break, Authaal returned in the Underwood Stakes at Caulfield Racecourse in which he was partnered by Brent Thomson. He won his second Australian Group 1 as he came home three lengths clear of Fair Sir. In October, he finished fourth to Sky Chase in the Caulfield Stakes and third under top weight in the Caulfield Cup. Stud career In 1989, Authaal was retired from racing and sent to Japan to become a breeding stallion. He spent ten seasons at stud in Japan but attracted little interest from breeders after 1995 and covered his last mares in 1999. The best of his offspring was the Grade III winner Ibuki Rajo Mon. Pedigree *Authaal was inbred 3 √ó 4 to Charlottesville, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

The square takes its name from the Church of Saint Philip Neri, which presides over the square. To the right of the church is the School of Saint Felip Neri which uses the square as a playground. To the left of the church is a house used by the Oratory of Saint Philip Neri. In the centre of the square is an octagonal fountain, dedicated as a symbol of life. The architecture of the square and surrounding buildings is in the medieval Baroque-style. History Pockmarked church walls from bombings The square was once home to the Palace of Neri built in 1752. In the mid-20th century, Gothic buildings from other areas of the city were moved stone by stone to the square, instead of demolishing them to make room for urban developments. When the hotel Neri was built it was faced in similar gothic stone to maintain the gothic style of the square. In 1938 during the Spanish Civil War, Francisco Franco laid siege to the city of Barcelona. On the 30 January 1938, one of Franco's bombs fell on the church killing 30 people most of whom were children from the School of Sant Philip Neri and some were refugee children from Madrid where the church had been turned into a makeshift orphanage. As people pulled survivors from the rubble, a second bomb hit the square, killing 12 more bringing the death toll to 42. It was the second worst bombing hit in Barcelona during the war. Evidence of the bombings can be seen in the pockmarked walls of the church. Museu del Cal√ßat, a footwear museum in the square was closed in 2015 and building remains unused. Myths A myth spread by the Francoist authorities stated that the pockmarks in the stone were from the bullets of an anarchist execution of church priests. This was spread in an attempt to cover up evidence of the 1938 bombings.

It is based on his Ph.D. thesis, 'Upper Lotharingia and Champagne c.850 to c.1100' (University of Cambridge, Faculty of History, 2007). Summary The book's key purpose, discussed in the introduction, is to advance discussion of the origins of feudalism. Whereas Georges Duby and his successors had argued from the 1950s that the 'feudal revolution' began in France around the year 1000, in the 1990s Dominique Barth√©lemy had led an argument that many these changes happened around 900, but only became obvious in the surviving source-material later, while others are more closely associated with the twelfth century. West argues that scholarship had reached an impasse, needing new perspectives drawing on earlier evidence. His chosen case study was the area between the rivers Marne and Moselle, corresponding to Champagne and Upper Lotharingia. The key argument of the book, and its 'biggest departure from the Feudal Revolution model'Theo Riches, review of Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation between Marne and Moselle, c. 800‚Äìc. 1100, Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, Fourth Series 90 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), Early Medieval Europe, 24 (2016), 261--63 (p. 261). DOI: 10.1111/emed.12151 is that the ninth-century Carolingians, faced with a world in which property rights were not clearly defined, and in which the meanings of rituals were fluid and open to interpretation, spurred a drive to define and formalise social relations, now known loosely as the 'Carolingian reforms'. West argues that while many aspects of Carolingian political life did not survive the collapse of the Carolingian Empire in the 880s, this urge to formalise did. He finds that the driver of feudalisation was not primarily the relationship between fiefs and vassals, but the formalisation of power as property rights (particularly ownership of land), which could then be exchanged. 'The ruling family's monopoly on rule was eventually lost, but in the end that was a mere matter of dynastic accident. It seems more important that had the Carolingian project continued, it would have ended in a world dominated by power so formalised and well-defined that it could in some circumstances even be thought of as property, which is more or less exactly what happened' (p. 263). The book is arranged chronologically in three parts. Part I, 'The Parameters of Carolingian Society', is structured as a thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. Chapter 1 shows that the Carolingians' efforts to formalise and integrate institutions of government‚îÄnot least kingship‚îÄwere not merely rhetorical and did have significant consequences. Chapter 2, however, shows the validity of counter-arguments that, despite this, formal ideas of offices and property 'dissolve on inspection' (p. 76), revealing a politics that was more unstable, contested and provisional. Chapter 3 synthesises these arguments by arguing that while Carolingians did not create a public state, their cultural reforms did have a profound effect on elites' ways of thinking: 'the impasse ... between top-down approaches and those centred on the local practice of power, which has shadowed the debate on the Feudal Revolution, can be dismantled. We need to think of symbolic practices reaching throughout society, with eminently practical consequences' (p. 104). This chapter has been seen as 'the keystone of the entire book'.Theo Riches, review of Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation between Marne and Moselle, c. 800‚Äìc. 1100, Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, Fourth Series 90 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), Early Medieval Europe, 24 (2016), 261--63 (p. 262). DOI: 10.1111/emed.12151 Part II, 'The Long Tenth Century, c. 880‚Äìc. 1030', examines a period where evidence is particularly hard to interpret, essentially bridging the better understood periods on either side.Theo Riches, review of Charles West, Reframing the Feudal Revolution: Political and Social Transformation between Marne and Moselle, c. 800‚Äìc. 1100, Cambridge Studies in Medieval Life and Thought, Fourth Series 90 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2013), Early Medieval Europe, 24 (2016), 261--63 (p. 262).

DOI: 10.1111/1468-229X.12057_4 306 West uses the clearer evidence of sections 1 and 3 to establish a framework, and tries provisionally to interpret the disparate evidence about the tenth century through this framework. Chapter 4 argues that the weaker kingship evident in the post-Carolingian period may have been a consequence of the Carolingians' own project of formalising and stabilising the power of the aristocracy, and so a symptom of wider social change rather than a cause of it. Chapter 5, correspondingly, argues that the tenth century saw a process of 'symbolic impoverishment', whereby the social meanings of rituals and practices became less fluid and more fixed. Thus, rather than being defined through relationships with the royal court, the position of count (comes) came to be legally stable on its own terms, independently of the ruling dynasty. Part III, 'The Exercise of Authority through Property Rights, c. 1030‚Äìc. 1130' argues that the emergence of feudalism was a knock-on effect of ninth-century Carolingian reforms. Chapter 6 focuses on the emergence of so-called 'bannal lordship' and argues that the eleventh century saw the emergence of a more tightly defined concept of land ownership familiar today but not before. Whereas before aristocrats might pass on their office to their successors, in the twelfth century they could pass on the ownership of land: a 'precipitation of rights' into a form of 'petrified social power'. Whereas the exercise of power had once been quite improvisatory, 'in the late eleventh century, lords everywhere were busily working out whether they had the right' to extract rents and dues (p. 196). Chapter 7 is the book's closest engagement with Susan Reynolds's seminal Fiefs and Vassals, and argues amongst other things that the ecclesiastical Investiture Dispute is evidence for a more general enthusiasm for defining and constituting more precisely social roles, statuses, laws and rituals. Finally, chapter 8 compares and contrasts Champagne and Upper Lotharingia, considering how different political conditions in these parts of the former Carolingian Empire cast light on West's thesis. 'Judicial rights emerged from the undifferentiated authority of the ninth century everywhere; it was merely the means by which they did so that differed. East of the Meuse, the process took place in a more ordered way, managed by the kings and co- ordinated by the exploitation of intact ecclesiastical estates; in the west, with less co-ordination provided either by ecclesiastical estates or the royal court, there was greater fragmentation' (p. 254).

It consisted of eight companies of Maltese soldiers, and it saw action in the French Revolutionary Wars. It was the second Maltese unit in British service, after the Maltese Cannoneers. British troops first arrived in Malta in 1798 in order to aid the Maltese in their rebellion against the French. On 10 December 1799, the 30th and 89th Regiments of Foot arrived from Sicily in order to enforce the blockade of Valletta, which was being held by the French. By February 1800, the commander of the British forces in Malta Brigadier-General Thomas Graham informed his superiors that he was intending to raise a Maltese force to fight in the blockade. The first two companies of the Maltese Light Infantry were set up on 2 April 1800, and by May the unit had eight companies of 100 men each. It was temporarily commanded by Captain James Weir of the Royal Marines, before being transferred to Brigadier-General Moncrieff on 9 June 1800. Sergeants from the 30th and 89th Regiments became subaltern officers in the Maltese Light Infantry. Soldiers in the battalion were paid 8d a day, and their uniforms consisted of blue-grey coats which had red facings and gold lace, along with nankeen trousers. The battalion fought in the blockade alongside both Maltese irregular forces and British regular troops, until the French surrendered in September 1800. By the beginning of 1801, the battalion had 747 men garrisoned at Fort Manoel and Fort Ricasoli, with a detachment at Fort St. Angelo. Although the battalion was intended for local service, 300 volunteers were sent to Elba on 22 September 1801 on board HMS Athenienne. They arrived on 11 October, relieving the besieged British garrison during the Siege of Porto Ferrajo. The detachment in Elba returned to Malta in April 1802, and the battalion was disbanded upon the expiration of the two-year period for which its men had enlisted. Many of the soldiers re-enlisted in the newly formed Maltese Provincial Battalions. The regimental colours of the Maltese Light Infantry were presented to Major Weir. In 1884, his son returned them to Malta and Governor Arthur Borton presented them to the Royal Malta Fencible Artillery. They were then deposited in the Palace Armoury in Valletta.

His grandfather and uncle had held the seat almost continuously since 1846. After the fall of France, in 1940 Plichon voted in favor of giving power to Marshall Petain. Early years Jean-Pierre Plichon was born in Paris on 13 March 1907. His family was from the Nord department. His grandfather was Charles Ignace Plichon (1814‚Äì88), a company director who was first elected deputy in 1846, and then held office almost continuously until his death. After his grandfather died the Indicateur d'Hazebrouck asserted that \\"Flanders made Plichon, Plichon made Flanders\\". Jean-Pierre's parents were Pierre Plichon (1865‚Äì1936), a lawyer, and Aim√©e Salanson (1882‚Äì1963). His uncle was the industrialist Jean Plichon. In 1924 his uncle was president of the Compagnie des mines de B√©thune and Deputy for Nord. The Bethune mines had become a fief of the Plichons, since Pierre Plichon and Jean-Pierre Plichon also joined the company. Jean-Pierre Plichon studied at the Ecole centrale and qualified as an engineer of art and manufactures. He moved to Bailleul, Nord, where he worked in industry. On 6 July 1937 he married Odile Desmytt√®re (1917‚Äì2004). Political career At the age of 29 Plichon ran for election in the second district of Hazebrouck, Nord, as candidate of the Republican Union. The seat had been occupied by his uncle, Lieutenant-Colonel Jean Plichon, since 1889. In his campaign he made the point that his family had already provided two deputies for the Nord department. He defended the family, stood for protection of commerce and industry, and supported higher prices for farmers and the right for them to organize. He did not have a clear majority in the first round of voting on 26 April 1936, but won in the second round on 3 May 1936. Jean-Pierre Plichon was a member of the Chamber of Deputies representing the Nord department from 3 May 1936 to 31 May 1942 as a member of the Independent Republicans and Social Action group. He was a member of committees on aeronautics and civil and criminal law. He was active in addressing the concerns of his constituents. He proposed laws to provide aid to victims of floods in the Nord, and to clear rivers. He wanted to encourage private construction, but was against excessive rents. He proposed large rural works to combat unemployment, and organization of the coal market. He was interested in many rural questions such as duties on imported hops, veterinary medicine, sharecropping and wheat. Plichon sat on about 20 company boards. He was aged 32 at the outbreak of World War II (1939‚Äì45). He intervened on the subjects of tax relief for mobilized people, maintaining territorial integrity, suppressing espionage and excluding communists from the chamber of deputies. After the defeat of France, on 10 July 1940 he voted in favor of granting the requested constitutional powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain. Jean-Pierre Plichon died in Lille, Nord, on 14 May 1966.

It occurs in shallow water in the West Atlantic Ocean and Caribbean Sea, sometimes as small solid heads and sometimes as unattached cone-shaped forms. Description Skeleton M. areolata is a colonial coral. Budding is intracalicular, occurring within the whorl of tentacles of the polyp. The corallites are arranged in a meandroid fashion, which means there are a series of linked centres in broad valleys, often wide, giving the colony the appearance of the surface of a human brain. The polyps share an elongate oral disc with the tentacles round the rim. Colonies are small, often less than in diameter. Manicina areolata has two entirely different growth forms. Some individuals form small, solid hemispherical heads while others are small, cone-shaped structures that are not attached to the seabed. The surface of the coral consists of long meandering walls with wide intervening valleys. The polyps sit in corallites (stony cups) in the valleys from which fine septa (transverse ridges) extend in several series up to the summit of the walls on either side. Often the whole coral consists of one long, convoluted valley, sometimes with side valleys. Where there is more than one valley, the intervening walls have grooves running along the top. The colour of this coral is yellowish-brown, tan or dark brown, often with the valleys and walls being contrasting colours. The polyps are only extended at night and their oral surfaces are often green. Distribution and habitat M. areolata is native to the tropical and subtropical West Atlantic Ocean. Its range includes the southern half of the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean Sea, southern Florida, the Bahamas and Bermuda. It is found on soft sediments, cobble or rubble, on fore- reef and back-reef slopes and in sea grass meadows. Usually occurring at depths of less than , its lower depth limit is around . The massive form is found on reefs attached to rocks but the unattached form is found on areas of broken coral fragments and on sandy or muddy substrates including lagoons and turtle grass (Thalassia testudinum) meadows. Ecology The unattached cone- shaped form of Manicina areolata can right itself if overturned by a fish, current or wave action. The polyps have pleats and muscles in the mesentries which enable them to extend further from the corallite than can small-polyp corals. This gives them the facility to inflate the body cavity with water, enabling the polyps to swell up and dislodge sediment, and even turn the colony over if this proves necessary. It does this by inflating itself by filling its interior with water and then emitting jets of water on one side to make the whole structure topple over. It is a slow process and is more difficult to achieve as the coral grows larger. This may be the reason that this coral seldom exceeds a diameter of . This coral can rid itself of sediment that threatens to engulf it by producing mucus and sloughing this and the sediment that adheres to it like a skin. The tissues of this coral contain symbiotic unicellular algae called zooxanthella. Manicina areolata is a hermaphrodite, the gametes are produced around the time of the full moon in May and June. Fertilisation is internal and the larvae are brooded inside the colony for two weeks before being released simultaneously on the night of the new moon. The larvae may drift planktonically or settle immediately. Other corals that occupy a similar habitat, and which often co-occur with rose coral, are the free-living corals Porites divaricata, Cladocora arbuscula and several species of Oculina. Status Rose coral is tolerant of a wide range of salinities and temperature variations and some degree of sedimentation. It is a common species and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has rated it as being of \\"least concern\\".

It is the United States' primary arts organization dedicated towards the promotion of Latino art and artists in the United States and Latin America. It supports 900 artists and art-based organizations. Since its founding in 1989, NALAC has provided over 2.3 million dollars in grant money in support of over 185,000 Latino artists and art based organizations throughout the region. History NALAC was founded in 1989 when a group of Latino artists of various disciplines, came together to advocate nationally for Latino art. Initially NALAC provided Latino artists with a network of support, but found itself struggling and without clear direction. NALAC's board of directors appointed long-time volunteer Mar√≠a L√≥pez De Le√≥n as executive director in 2002. Maria served on the National Council of the Arts under president Barack Obama. Maria utilized her network within the art world to raise money and create NALAC's first grant program - NALAC Fund for the Arts. The Fund allowed individual projects to be brought to life, but only provided funding for single projects and most artists had trouble marketing themselves or their work. Leadership Institute In the early 1990s, NALAC began to develop the \\"Leadership Institute\\". The Institute selects promising artists and teaches them how to network and develop business and administration skills. Additionally, they help to cultivate their artistic skills and network with other artists. The Leadership Institute was facilitated by teachers such as Actor/Director Rosalba Rolon, Maribel Alvarez and Abel Lopez and helped develop the career of artist Lia Uribe, among others. Transnational Cultural Remittances Grant Program Created in 2008 and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts, The Ford Foundation and The Andrew Mellon Foundation, it was a way for both individuals and community groups to utilize art for cultural exchange between the United States, Mexico and Central America. Documentary Visiones, produced by Galan productions and NALAC, is a six- part documentary series that takes audiences on a trip across the United States, displaying the creative talent of Latino artists from all walks of life. The documentary was presented on PBS and went on to win the Imagen award. The series, along with its accompanying education curriculum, is a tool created to expose student to Latino arts and culture; it has been distributed to more than 35,000 schools.

Effect 140px =Background= Across the United States, utility poles in a given area may be owned by the local government, a municipal electric company, a private entity, or any combination of the three. In most cases, the poles are owned by a private entity, like a local incumbent phone company or electric company. Make Ready Work Before an Internet Service Provider (or any company) can add a new attachment or line to a utility pole, the existing attachments may need to be moved around so that the pole can be made ready to handle a new attachment or line. This is known as 'Make Ready work.' The reason Make Ready work is necessary is that, under Federal Law, to prevent the risk of outages or other issues, lines on utility poles must be spaced a certain distance apart from each other based on how many lines are on the pole. Under federal guidelines, Make Ready Work must occur sequentially, meaning that attachments can only be moved in the order with which they were originally placed on the line. This process can create massive delays, as well as other large disruptions in high traffic areas, such as alongside major roadways. In addition, the make ready work can take months, or even years, to complete as every company involved must send out their own approved contractor to move only their respective attachment. Each contractor must also schedule their work to not conflict with other contractors performing Make Ready Work, as well as taking into account other local factors, such as weather, traffic, and maintenance work (such as road paving). These factors must be considered as the United States primarily uses aerial work platforms to perform Make Ready Work. =One Touch Make Ready= To rectify these issues, several local governments have passed One Touch Make Ready legislation. While specific portions of the statutes vary, all carry a unifying theme that under these laws, certified construction crews chosen either by the pole owners or local governments are allowed to make all the necessary changes to a utility pole to make it ready for a new attachment. In a location which has adopted one touch make-ready, companies that own utility poles must agree on one or more common contractors that have permission to move existing attachments on a pole, allowing a single crew to move all attachments on a pole on a single visit, rather than sending in a unique crew to move each attachment sequentially. =Differences between localities= Nashville Nashville's OTMR ordinance is unique in that it includes a clause which requires a company wishing to install a new line (henceforth referred to as Company A), after having reached an agreement with the pole's owner, to give every company already on the pole 30 days notice to move their equipment. If those companies do not comply after 30 days, then Company A can perform the complex make-ready work. If there are any errors or problems from Company A's make-ready work, then the companies already on the pole can recoup expenses from Company A. Implementation in various areas As of August 2017, only three cities in the United States have One Touch Make Ready statutes: Louisville, Kentucky; Nashville, Tennessee; and San Antonio, Texas. Numerous other cities are in various stages along the process of implementing the One Touch Make Ready system. =Louisville, Kentucky= On February 11, 2016, the City Council of Louisville, Kentucky voted 23-0 to adopt a One Touch Make-Ready Statute, making it the first city in the country to adopt such legislation. According to city councilman Bill Hollander, who sponsored the legislation \\"This will help businesses locate here and grow here. It will create jobs, and will retain and attract our young people and make Louisville broadband ready.\\" These sentiments were echoed by Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer, who stated that it would help lay the groundwork for entities like Google Fiber, and said \\"Tonight's vote puts Louisville one step closer toward becoming a Google Fiber city.\\" The legislation states that an applicant for attachment must first receive approval from the existing pole owners, at which point it may contract a pre-approved construction crew to perform all make ready work at its own expense. Pole owners and pre-existing providers whose wires were moved may choose to do post-make ready work inspections and call for remedial work if needed, at the new provider's expense. =San Antonio, Texas= On May 6, 2016, San Antonio's municipal utility, CPS Energy, adopted broad new guidelines which included many of the fundamental principles of One Touch Make Ready legislation. The standards include specific requirements for OTMR, and include what needs to happen before, during and after the process. The 128-page standards are far more detailed than the legislation passed by Louisville, Kentucky a few months prior. This is mainly due to CPS being an electric company. The Introduction of the standards states: The standards go on to lay out technical provisions, administrative procedures, as well as various specific provisions for both wired and wireless utility pole attachments. They incorporate recommendations from the FCC on how best to expand broadband while also addressing safety concerns by working into the guidelines various safety standards recommended by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). =Nashville, Tennessee= On August 2, 2016, the Metropolitan Council of Nashville and Davidson County began to debate its own One Touch Make Ready Ordinance. The measure, sponsored by Councilman Anthony Davis, was nearly identical to the measure passed by the city of Louisville several months prior. On September 6, 2016, the Nashville City Council Approved the Measure 32-7 on a roll-call vote, as the Council's computer systems were down. On September 20, 2016, Councilwoman Tanaka Vercher, a critic of the bill, proposed a resolution that would delay voting on the bill for two Council meetings. This resolution was defeated 26-12. A few hours later, the City Council passed the OTMR bill via voice vote. After the vote, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry, stated she would sign the bill. On September 21, 2016, the Mayor of Nashville, Tennessee, Megan Barry, signed into law the city's OTMR ordinance. The ordinance exists under Nashville Law as Ordinance BL2016-343 Notably, throughout the entire process of the debate amongst council lawmakers on the specifics of the bill, Barry remained neutral on the bill's contents, refusing to comment on the bill's status, and only encouraging lawmakers and providers to seek a compromise. Arguments =In favor= Reduced cost, time, and disruption An aerial work platform. Supporters, such as the Fiber to the Home Council (FTTHC) and the National Cable and Telecommunications Association (NCTA), argue that OTMR policies drastically reduce the cost of adding additional lines, noting that allowing a single crew to work on a line over the course of a single workday, as opposed to multiple crews working on multiple, often non-sequential days, reduces the financial cost of adding additional lines, by decreasing the number of workers needed to install a new line, thereby decreasing the total number of man-hours worked. Further, the FTTHC argues that OTMR policies reduce the traffic disruption caused by the large Aerial work platforms used by the overwhelming majority of utility pole maintenance companies in the United States. Increased Competition Supporters, such as Google Fiber and several lawmakers, have argued that OTMR policies create and encourage competition, as they can theoretically allow any outside Internet service provider to lay networks of Fiber optic cables, thus leading to a breakup of the various local internet monopolies which exist across the United States. =Opposed= Numerous groups have criticized OTMR since its implementation in several cities. The American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), along with several lobbying groups, have critiqued the proposal. In addition, the measure has received extremely vocal opposition from cable and telephone providers, mainly AT&T; and Comcast, who together have thus far filed lawsuits against every city which has successfully passed OTMR ordinances. Federal oversight Opponents, including AT&T;, Comcast, and the Nashville Electric Service (NES), have argued that the regulation of telecommunications poles falls under the purview of the Federal Communications Commission. To back this up, they cite federal pole attachment rules, which mandate the Federal Communications Commission, not local municipalities, regulate telecommunications poles. However, on October 30, 2016, in response to the case AT&T; v. Louisville Metro, the Federal Communications Commission stated that states which have opted out of the FCC guidelines (including Kentucky) are not subject to the Federal Pole Attachment rules. Involvement of Google Fiber Opponents, including the American Legislative Exchange Council, have criticized the policy as a blatant attempt by local officials to \\"bend over backward\\" to ensure the continued support of Google Fiber's expansion within their respective cities. ALEC further contends that cities are willing to spend millions of taxpayer dollars to defend legislation in court that they see as only a way to appease Google. They cite Google's willingness to join as defendants in every OTMR lawsuit filed as of August 2017. Rights of corporations Opponents such as the American Legislative Exchange Council have argued that OTMR ordinances violate the property rights of corporations to control what happens on their respective lines. They further claim that OTMR ordinances violate federal property law by allegedly allowing any third party to relocate equipment on a pole, without notifying the equipment's owners, unless the third party believes there will be a service outage. However, so far, all cities which have successfully passed OTMR ordinances have included provisions which mandate that only contractors approved by the pole's owners may work on the lines. Union concerns Opponents, such as the Communications Workers of America (the largest communications labor union in the United States), have argued against One Touch Make Ready proposals on the grounds that the new proposals have the potential to create unsafe working conditions, as well as violate existing labor contracts. In their filing with the Federal Communications Commission on the matter, the union argues that since new attachers would not be required to submit formal applications, this could lead to a situation where existing infrastructure could be damaged by workers who are unfamiliar with the lines. The union further emphasizes that pole owners should be able to conduct a thorough review of the lines before any work can be done. Legality States where One Touch Make Ready can legally be implemented, according to the Federal Communications Commission Under the guidelines of the Federal Communications Commission, states are presented with two options for the regulation of their utility poles. They can either pass legislation recognizing the right of the FCC to regulate their utility poles, or states can form their own regulatory agencies and maintain their right to self-regulate their utility poles. As of 2016, thirty states have turned over regulatory power to the FCC, while the remaining twenty states have maintained their right to self-regulate. All Territories of the United States and Insular areas must adopt the federal guidelines. According to the Federal Communications Commission in 2016, under current regulatory statutes, localities that reside in states which have forfeited their right to self-regulate their utility poles to the federal government are unable to implement One Touch Make Ready legislation in its current form. The twenty states which maintained their right to self-regulate, and thus can pass OTMR legislation are: *Alaska *Arkansas *California *Connecticut *Delaware *Idaho *Illinois *Louisiana *Kentucky *Maine *Massachusetts *Michigan *New Hampshire *New Jersey *New York *Ohio *Oregon *Utah *Vermont *Washington Legal Challenges =AT&T; vs. Louisville Metro Government= On February 25, 2016, AT&T; (which owns an estimated 25-40% of Louisville, Kentucky's utility poles) filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Louisville Metro Government. In the lawsuit, officially titled BellSouth Telecommunications LLC vs. Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government, AT&T; argued that the city's One Touch Make Ready ordinance violated state and federal law. In the 11-page filing, AT&T; asked a federal judge to clarify that the power to regulate pole attachments lies solely with the Kentucky Public Service Commission, as well as with the Federal Communications Commission. In response to the lawsuit, Louisville Mayor Greg Fischer stated: \\"We will vigorously defend the lawsuit filed today by AT&T;, as Gigabit fiber is too important to our city's future.\\" AT&T; responded by stating that the ordinance allowed third parties to seize its property temporarily. In a statement, an AT&T; spokesman said: \\"Unless the court declares the ordinance invalid and permanently enjoins Louisville Metro from enforcing it, AT&T; will suffer irreparable harm that cannot be addressed by recovery of damages.\\" On February 26, 2016, in an official blog post titled \\"Standing With Louisville,\\" Chris Levendos, Google Fiber's Director of National Deployment and Operations stood by the city, stating: \\"Google Fiber stands with the city of Louisville and the other cities across the country that are taking steps to bring faster, better broadband to their residents.\\" On June 29, 2016, Attorneys for Frontier Communications filed a briefing in federal court asking to join AT&T; as plaintiffs in the case. In their briefing, Frontier argued that, even though they do not serve the state of Kentucky, the ordinance's \\"unprecedented scope\\" could set a precedent that could harm Frontier's business in the future. Frontier also noted that they were not paid by AT&T; to assist in the suit, nor were they asked about it. On October 6, 2016, Attorneys for Google Fiber filed a court briefing that, if approved, would allow the company to assist in defending against the suit. In their filing, they claim the ordinance is: \\"a valid exercise of Louisville Metro's unquestioned authority to manage construction activities in public rights-of-way.\\" Further, the attorneys argued that the ordinance would \\"enhance public safety while reducing disturbance and congestion.\\" On October 31, 2016, in response to the lawsuit, the Federal Communications Commission released a statement, which guaranteed that the city's OTMR ordinance does not conflict with federal law. In the filing, the FCC stated that \\"[AT&T;] maintains in its motion for summary judgment that the Louisville Ordinance conflicts with, and is therefore preempted by, the federal pole-attachment rules promulgated by the Commission under Section 224. That argument is wrong as a matter of law.\\" On August 16, 2017, US District Court Judge David Hayes rejected AT&T;'s arguments and threw out the lawsuit. \\"A one-touch make-ready approach inherently regulates public rights-of-way because it reduces the number of encumbrances or burdens placed on public rights-of-way,\\" Hale wrote. \\"The one-touch make-ready ordinance requires that all necessary make-ready work be performed by a single crew, lessening the impact of make-ready work on public rights-of-way.\\" Hale also ruled that FCC guidelines do not apply in Kentucky, as the state exempted itself from those laws. =AT&T;/Comcast vs. Nashville Metro Government= On September 22, 2016, AT&T; filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Metro Government of Nashville, Tennessee, less than 24 hours after the city had passed its One Touch Make Ready Ordinance. At the time, AT&T; owned approximately 20% of the utility poles within the Nashville Metro area. In the lawsuit, titled BellSouth Telecommunications, LLC, D/B/A AT&T;, Tennessee versus The Metropolitan Government of Nashville and Davidson County, Tennessee; In her official capacity as Mayor; and Mark Sturtevant, in his official capacity as transitional interim Director of the Department of Public Works, AT&T; argued that the sole authority to regulate utility poles lies with the Federal Communications Commission. The lawsuit sought from the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee a permanent injunction against the city, preventing the ordinance from ever going into effect. Notably, the lawsuit differed from the one filed against the city of Louisville in that it did not claim that the state had the power to regulate utility poles. On October 26, 2016, Comcast filed a lawsuit in federal court against the Metro Government of Nashville over the city's One Touch ordinance. Comcast, like AT&T;, sought a permanent injunction to prevent the ordinance from going into effect. In response to the filing, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry said: \\"One Touch Make Ready has been litigated in the court of public opinion, and the public overwhelmingly supports this measure designed to speed up the deployment of high-speed fiber in Nashville. Now, we hope that this federal litigation is quickly resolved so that we can get on with the business of expanding access to gigabit Internet throughout Davidson County.\\" On October 31, 2016, Nashville Metro filed a request with a federal judge to consolidate the two lawsuits. In the filing, attorneys representing the city argued for why the cases should be consolidated: > Defendants propose that consolidation is proper because: (1) both cases > arrive from substantially similar operative facts and claims and involve > similar defenses relating to the Metropolitan Government's enactment of > Ordinance BL2016-343; (2) Plaintiff's civil cover sheet in Comcast > references this case as a related case (Comcast, Doc. No. 1-3); (3) allowing > the cases to proceed separately risks inconsistent adjudication; (4) > adjudicating parallel cases in the same Court would inevitably require > duplicative tasks and duplicative rulings; and (5) both cases are already in > the same Court, so consolidation would not require a case to be transferred > to a different Court. For these reasons, Defendants propose that > consolidation of these cases is in the best interest of the parties and > promotes judicial economy. On November 10, 2016, Ken Sharp, the federal judge overseeing the case, approved the request to merge the lawsuits. He also granted an extension to the city's deadline to file a response to the initial filing of the lawsuit, extending their deadline to November 14. On November 14, 2016, the city of Nashville filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, citing that AT&T; did not provide information regarding exactly where the local ordinance conflicted with federal law. \\"The Metropolitan Government determined on a municipal level what approach to rights-of-way management would best serve local needs, and enacted an ordinance that aligns with and supports federal policy,\\" Nashville's filing supporting the motion said. =Charter Communications vs. Louisville Metro Government= On October 5, 2016, Charter Communications, a utility company that owns Time Warner Cable and does business in Louisville, filed a lawsuit against the city's Metro Government. In the lawsuit, Charter alleges that the city's OTMR ordinance violates Charter's fifth amendment rights, specifically over what is referred to as the \\"Taking's Clause.\\" The takings clause states that \\"... private property [shall not] be taken for public use, without just compensation.\\" Charter's lawsuit also hinges on the argument that their right to \\"speak\\" as a corporation is being violated, however, Charter's lawyers did not specifically reference any infringement by the local government. On June 29, 2017, it was revealed through court filings that the case, officially titled \\"Insight Kentucky Partners versus Louisville/Jefferson County Metro Government\\" would be going to trial. The trial is set to be overseen by U.S District Senior Judge Charles Ralph Simpson III. After a federal judge threw out AT&T;'s lawsuit against the city of Louisville, it was revealed that Charter's lawsuit would be unaffected. =Nashville Electric Service vs. Nashville Metro Government= On October 21, 2016, the Nashville Electric Service (abbreviated NES), which is one of the twelve largest public electric utilities in the United States, filed a lawsuit against the Metro Government of Nashville, Tennessee. At the time, NES owned 80 percent of the utility poles in Nashville. After filing the lawsuit, a spokesman for the company said the OTMR ordinance forces the company to choose between complying with the new law or its existing contracts with AT&T;, Comcast, as well as other internet providers. According to the court filing, the declaratory judgment is meant to clarify NES's rights and obligations. The company also stated that it had received a letter from AT&T;, threatening to sue them if they complied with the law. In response to the lawsuit being filed, Nashville Mayor Megan Barry stated: \\"We believe in One Touch Make Ready and look forward to defending its legality. Our focus is simply on providing services to our citizens, who have expressed their desire for those services through their elected representatives.\\" On February 3, 2017, NES announced that it had reached an out-of-court settlement with Google Fiber, as well as the city of Nashville, over the OTMR policy. In the agreement, \\"Google Fiber [has] promised NES it would pay any potential damages that result from NES abiding by the ordinance in relation to the deployment of Google Fiber,\\" NES President and CEO Decosta Jenkins said in a statement issued Friday. She further clarified \\"This is a win for NES, Google Fiber, Nashville and residents who are looking forward to having access to Google Fiber.\\" As part of this settlement, NES dropped its pending lawsuits against Google and the city of Nashville.

These two numbers are both NP-hard to compute. *The Tardos function is monotone, in the sense that adding edges to a graph can only cause its Tardos function to increase or stay the same, but never decrease. *The Tardos function can be computed in polynomial time. *Any monotone circuit for computing the Tardos function requires exponential size. To define her function, Tardos uses a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the Lov√°sz number, based on the ellipsoid method and provided by .. Approximating the Lov√°sz number of the complement and then rounding the approximation to an integer would not necessarily produce a monotone function, however. To make the result monotone, Tardos approximates the Lov√°sz number of the complement to within an additive error of 1/n^2, adds m/n^2 to the approximation, and then rounds the result to the nearest integer. Here m denotes the number of edges in the given graph, and n denotes the number of vertices. Tardos used her function to prove an exponential separation between the capabilities of monotone Boolean logic circuits and arbitrary circuits. A result of Alexander Razborov, previously used to show that the clique number required exponentially large monotone circuits, also shows that the Tardos function requires exponentially large monotone circuits despite being computable by a non-monotone circuit of polynomial size.

As part of the Union Navy, she saw service during the American Civil War.  Construction, acquisition, and commissioning  Bohio was constructed as a civilian brig at Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, in 1856. The U.S. Navy purchased her on 9 September 1861 for service in the American Civil War and commissioned her on 30 December 1861 with Acting Master William D. Gregory in command.  Service history  Bohio joined the Union Navy‚Ä≤s West Gulf Blockading Squadron in the Gulf of Mexico in January 1862 to take part in the Union blockade of Confederate ports and cruised along the coasts of Alabama and Louisiana. During 1862 she took four prizes and forced the scuttling of a fifth vessel. She joined the U.S. Navy screw steamer in destroying the salt works along St. Andrew Bay in Florida between 24 November and 8 December 1862.

Fitzgerald attended Wesleyan Female College in Macon, Georgia and was a founder of the first secret society established at a women's college. Originally called the Adelphean Society, it had six charter members, and its purpose was to support one another in intellectual, social, and moral betterment. The society extended its initial purpose to the field of community service and scholarship aid.  Early life  Fitzgerald was born in Laurens County, Georgia, January 29, 1834. She had three sisters and one brother. Fitzgerald's father was a prominent physician and owner of two plantations with several slaves. He provided governesses for childhood schooling for her and her siblings since there were no adequate public schools available in their rural area and he could afford it. The female tutors were from the Northern states. One had a radical outlook and caused problems among the household servants and was therefore dismissed from her duties. The Tucker family lived in a large house that had a library. Fitzgerald and her brother were then sent to a small town near Milledgeville, Georgia, for further education. They entered an academy and later a college there. Her brother went on to Princeton University in New Jersey. Fitzgerald went on to Wesleyan Female College in Macon. She graduated as valedictorian of her senior class in 1852.  Mid-life  Fitzgerald was first married to Judge Arthur E. Cochran in Glynn County, Georgia, on July 3, 1853, when she was 19 years old. They lived in Macon. The judge was a widower and had a son whom she helped rear until he was able to be on his own. Judge Cochran died in 1854. In 1862 she married Dr. Edmund Fitzgerald who was a widower with a daughter, Caroline (\\"Carrie\\"). After Dr. Fitzgerald died in 1887, Fitzgerald and Carrie moved from Macon to Washington, D.C. Carrie then married Captain A. F. Lucas, a successful civil engineer in the oil industry. Fitzgerald lived there with her stepdaughter and new husband for many years and eventually moved to Fort Worth, Texas.  Secret society  Fitzgerald became one of the founders of the first woman's secret society established in a girls' college on May 15, 1851. The sorority, founded at Wesleyan Female College in Macon, had six charter members. The seven founders were: Eugenia Tucker (Fitzgerald), Octavia Andrew (Rush), Maria J. Easterling, Mary Evans (Glass), Oceana L. Goodall, Ella Pierce (Turner), and Elizabeth Williams. It was originally called the Adelphean Society and in 1903 changed its name to Alpha Delta Pi sorority. Fitzgerald was its first president and held their meetings in the college's Adelphean Room. It was founded for mutual improvement and enjoyment of a group of young women pioneers in college sororities. Its purpose was a desire \\"to better one another morally, mentally, and socially.\\" Their motto is We live for each other. The oldest secret society for college women in the country celebrated its 100th birthday at the University of Tennessee on May 15, 1951. There was a five day centennial convention at the Wesleyan Female College in Macon starting June 25, 1951, at which time a portrait of the founder was dedicated. By 1952 the society had grown from six charter members to over 34,000. The society has extended its initial purpose to the field of community service and scholarship aid to foreign students. It has enabled top performing students of foreign countries to continue their studies in colleges and universities of the United States. Membership was at 55,000 in 1963 within 106 collegiate chapters and 310 alumnae groups.  Later life and death  Fitzgerald spent her last 18 years with her niece in Fort Worth. She died there on December 10, 1928, and was buried in Oakwood Cemetery. Her body was disinterred in 1933 and brought to Macon's Rose Hill Cemetery where she was buried next to Dr. Fitzgerald.

An organ was built from 1622. The church tower was also used as a watchtower by the town, to give the alert to any incipient fires. The medieval tower was itself damaged by lightning in the early nineteenth century, and was replaced by a neo-Gothic tower (probably the first in this style in what is now Slovakia) designed by Fridrich Muck and constructed in 1852‚Äì1870, which is 70 meters high.Anon (2016), \\"The Tower of St. James Basilica\\", leaflet issued by the Town of Levoca. Of the original tower bells, one was relocated in the bell tower of the Town Hall; the others were melted down during World War I and were replaced in 1925.

The principal altars are as follows: *High Altar (Altar of St. James the Apostle). Created by Master Paul 1507‚Äì1517.Gavenda (2006) p. 5. The altar was constructed in stages. The retable was completed in 1508. Additional sculpture and painting may have been completed by 1515. The last phases, including gilding, were carried out by 1517.Homolka (1965), p. 44. Many of the paintings of the Passion on the altar's polyptych are based on the engravings by Lucas Cranach of the Passion cycle, published in 1509. The statues of the Twelve Apostles on the altar's ciborium date from about 1390, and may have been part of an earlier altar in the church.Homolka (1965), p. 47. * Sculptures of the Altar of the Nativity (Master Paul) ‚Äì now included in the baroque Czaky altar. The sculptures were hidden for 200 years in the Town Hall during the period of religious disturbances. *Altar of the Four Saint Johns (1520, Master Paul). * Altar of St. Anne (Altar of Metercia), (1516, Master Paul). *Altar of Saints Peter and Paul (1495, pre-dates Master Paul). * Altar of Bishop St. Nicholas (1507). The figures of St. Leonard and St. John are by Master Paul, but the figure of St. Nicholas dates from 1360‚Äì1370.Gavenda (2006) p. 7. *Altar of St. Catherine of Alexandria (c. 1460) *Altar of St. Michael Archangel (c. 1620). *Altar of The Good Shepherd (c. 1700). * Altar of Virgin Mary of the Snows (Altar of the Thirteen Towns).Gavenda (2006) p. 9. * Altar Vir dolorum, (Altar of King Matthias Corvinus) (1476‚Äì1490). *Altar of St. Elisabeth the Widow, a panel painting of 1492.

Painted epitaphs An unusual feature of the church is a number of painted epitaphs on the church walls. These include the epitaph of Margita Urbanoviƒç, Master Paul's niece, which is the only specific contemporary record that Paul was the creator of the high altar.Gavenda (2006), p. 9; Homolka (1965), p. 43. Organ Replacing earlier instruments, the present organ was built by Hans Hummel, a German-born organ builder, commencing in 1622. During the construction, Hummel fell to his death from the scaffolding in 1630, and the organ was completed by the Polish organ builder Juraj Nitrovsk√Ω. At the time it was the largest organ in the Kingdom of Hungary.

Yip Kue Sum was born in China in 1884. She married Joe Ah Chan, who emigrated to New Zealand in around 1905, but remained in China while he established himself in New Zealand. Kue Sum went to a private tutor in her village to study English, as at the time immigrants were required to pass a literacy test of 100 English words in order to enter New Zealand. She was able to pass the test and moved to New Zealand in 1920. Her husband had opened a general store at Matamata in the North Island, and Kue Sum ran the store together with him. Two years later, the couple moved to Thames and opened a fruit shop and market garden, and in 1924 they leased land for a vineyard and opened Goldleaf Vineyard. In 1935 they expanded to a second vineyard under the same name. As Ah Chan was frequently away from the vineyard for months at a time, Kue Sum was responsible for leading and managing the workers who picked, wrapped and packed the grapes for transportation. She was also responsible for the security of the vineyard, as burglars frequently broke in to steal grapes from the vines. She used an Alsatian watchdog to keep watch, and a broom as her weapon. Ah Chan was known in the local community for her generosity and hospitality. During the Depression she gave work to some of the many desperate people who came to the vineyard seeking employment, and was also a host to the other Chinese market gardeners in the area. The couple intended to retire to China and purchased a property in Canton; however the Communist victory in 1949 changed their plans and in 1950 the couple sold the vineyard and moved to Blockhouse Bay, Auckland. Kue Sum died in 1967 and was buried beside her husband, who had died in 1959, at Waikumete Cemetery. She was survived by her three children.

Starting off with a plunger gun, Cyberdillo must collect items such as platform shoes or bellbottoms to progress to the next level. Enemies the player come across include hairspray and bipedal hotdogs.

Development Cyberdillo was developed by Pixel Technologies and published by Panasonic in 1996. Reception Cyberdillo received mixed reviews from video game critics. A reviewer for GamePro called the gameplay \\"redundant\\" and lacking Doom's suspense. The reviewer was also mixed on the game's music. While calling it \\"tongue-in-cheek\\" and adding charm to the game, they added that the player's tolerance would depend on their liking of disco. They also described the voice acting as \\"unintelligible\\". Steve Bauman from Computer Games Magazine considered the soundtrack to be the best part of the game, while calling the game mediocre. Hardcore Gaming 101 criticized the controls for being too slippery and its level designs for being confusing.

Ciampi's middle name \\"Legrenzo\\" is frequently misspelled \\"Legrenzio\\", an error by F√©tis 1860, corrected by F√©tis & Pougin 1878. He is best known today for a work that cannot be certainly ascribed to his pen, the song \\"Tre giorni son che Nina in letto senesta\\", formerly called Pergolesi's \\"Nina\\".Osborne 2012, p. 205. Education and early career in Italy Ciampi studied at the Naples Conservatorio della Piet√† dei Turchini with Francesco Durante and Leonardo Leo.Van Boer 2012, p. 131. His first known success was the comic opera Da un disordine nasce un ordine, performed at the Teatro dei Fiorentini in Naples in 1737, when he was only eighteen.Walker 1954. Five more of his comic operas were produced in Naples up to 1745, and he also received commissions for operas to be presented in Rome and other Italian cities. In 1746 he was engaged as a harpsichordist at the opera house in Palermo,Van Boer 2012; Libby et al 2001. and his opera seria Ataserse was performed there in 1747.Walker 1954; Libby et al 2001. That same year he was engaged at the Ospedale degli Incurabili in Venice as an assistant to the maestro di coro G. B. Runcher, whom he had succeeded by 1748.Libby et al 2001. Ciampi is given this title in the libretto to his 1748 opera L'Adriano. London Ciampi was one the first music directors of the Ospedale to be given extended leave, and by the autumn of 1748 he was in London. His replacement at the Ospedale was Gioacchino Cocchi. In London Ciampi was the composer and director of music for a company of Italian singers under G. F. Crosa, who presented the first season of Italian comic opera at the King's Theatre, London.Libby et al 2001. The company's repertory consisted of works already presented in Venice, among which was Gli tre cicisbei ridicoli in which appeared the popular song \\"Tre giorni son che Nina\\", often attributed to Pergolesi. This caused Barclay Squire and others to suggest the song was actually composed by Ciampi, however, according to Frank Walker, \\"this is extremely doubtful\\".Walker 1954. See also Walker 1948; Squire 1914; Squire 1899; Libby et al 2001. Ciampi continued to appear in London until 1756.Marshall 2003, p. 233.

Since the 1990s he has lived in Cologne. His work centers around the major genocides of the 20th century, the systematic extermination of the Armenians and the Jews. Critics also praise him for his storytelling and his engagement in human rights work. In general they praise him for his engagement and in particular they praise him for his work with Turkish dissidents. His political point of view has led to several arrests. Life Akhanlƒ± was born in ≈ûav≈üat in the Artvin Province located in the Northeast of Turkey. He grew up in this small village. Age 12 he moved to live with his older brother in Istanbul and to continue education. He was arrested for a brief period in 1975 because he bought a left-wing paper. This incident led to his political interest and engagement. After the coup d'√©tat in 1980 he went underground. From 1985 to 1987 he was imprisoned for political reasons in a military jail in Istanbiul. Akhanlƒ± was tortured there. In 1991 he fled to Germany and requested asylum. Since the mid 1990s he lives in Cologne as a writer of political prose and essays. In 1998 the Turkish authorities stripped him of his citizenship. Three years later he became a German citizen. Akhanli is a collaborator of the association \\"recherche international\\", which furthers the investigation of the Armenian Genocide, committed in the first quarter of the 20th century. He has repeatedly raised his voice to debate the crimes against the Armenians. He also initiated the foundation of the Raphael Lemkin Library, located in Cologne, named after the man, he first described the atrocities against the Armenians as genocide. On 10 August 2010, Doƒüan Akhanlƒ± was arrested on entry into Turkey and was kept in investigative detention due to an alleged participation in a 1989 robbery incident. In December 2010 he was released. The trial continued in 2011 in his absence. Akhanlƒ± denied any involvement in the crime and denounced the accusation as politically motivated and constructed. On 12 October 2011, Akhanlƒ± was acquitted \\"for lack of evidence\\". Two witnesses had withdrawn their accusations, stating that they were forced by police to name Akhanlƒ±. Thereafter the Turkish authorities imposed an entry ban on the writer which was heavily criticized by German politician Cem √ñzdemir. In April 2013, the acquittal was lifted and an international arrest warrant was issued. On 19 August 2017, the Spanish police arrested Akhanlƒ± in Granada at the request of Turkish authorities. After an intervention of German foreign minister Sigmar Gabriel he was set free, but he is not allowed to leave Madrid until the court has decided about the Turkish extradition request. The ruling is expected within the next forty days. On 20 August 2017 German chancellor Angela Merkel sharply criticized the Turkish government because of abusing the international institution Interpol. ≈íuvre Akhanlƒ± has consistently displayed a very direct and open approach to historical violence, defending the universality of human rights and searching for the cause of the violence of the masses. His commitment in literature and political statements centers around the genocides of the 20th century, the Armenian genocide and the Shoah. His literature promotes cross-cultural dialogue and combines it with a call to reconciliation. He is a member of the PEN Centre Germany and has repeatedly spoken out in favor of imprisoned Turkish writers such as Aslƒ± Erdoƒüan.

It was the lead ship of its class, alongside . Deodoro was one of several ships to rebel in the 1910 Revolt of the Lash, and it was used for neutrality patrols during the First World War. It was sold to Mexico in 1924, and broken up for scrap in 1938.  Service  Deodoro was laid down by the French shipbuilding company Soci√©t√© Nouvelle des Forges et Chantiers de la M√©diterran√©e in 1896, supervised by Admiral Jos√© C√¢ndido Guillobel. Its construction was temporarily suspended by the Brazilians while they modified its design. It was launched on 18 June 1898, after a ceremony that was attended by representatives from Brazil, the French Navy, and a Russian gunboat. Its christening was accomplished with an electric button, which sent a signal to cut a cord and let a bottle of champagne break on the ship. At the beginning of the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War (1898), officials from both participants traveled to France to inspect the incomplete Deodoro and sister ship Floriano in view of purchasing them for the conflict. Neither was close enough to completion to make such an acquisition worthwhile.\\"Notes and Queries of Service Afloat and Ashore,\\" Navy & Army Illustrated, 401. Deodoro was completed in 1900, and its trials were successful, including a 24-hour trial with a mean speed of .Brassey, Naval Annual, 1900, 57. After the ship was handed over to Brazil, the ship left France en route for Brazil, stopping along the way in the Spanish Canary Islands. A nearby British warship, which was at that time engaged in the Second Boer War, suspected the ship of being a Boer-chartered privateer heading south to interfere with British merchant ships plying along the coast of southern Africa. Although the Brazilians were able to convince the British of their identity, they steamed with lights off for the next night or two in an effort to avoid further confusion with any other warships.\\"The New Brazilian Armorclad 'Marshal Deodoro',\\" Scientific American, 184.

Deodoro saw its first action in 1904, when it shelled rebelling soldiers at the military school at . Six years later, its own crew rebelled as part of the Revolt of the Lash. The Brazilian Navy at the time was heavily segregated between white officers and a broadly black or mulatto enlisted sailors, and the former would often violently punish the latter for even minor transgressions. Tensions came to a head in November 1910, when sailors aboard the new dreadnought rebelled, and the crews of Deodoro, another new dreadnought (), a new cruiser (), and several smaller vessels joined. The revolt ended peacefully, and the mutineers were granted an amnesty that was later cancelled.Morgan, Legacy, 200‚Äì59. In 1912, the Brazilian Navy overhauled Deodoro in Rio de Janeiro, fitting a new propulsion system and armament.Gardiner and Gray, Conway's 1906‚Äì21, 404. In September and October 1913, the ship took part in a major naval exercise with the majority of the Brazilian fleet, which was observed by the country's president, naval minister, and other politicians. During the First World War, the navy placed Deodoro in its northern squadron, which was responsible for neutrality patrols in the area between the states of Amazonas (located up the Amazon River) and Sergipe. Deodoro, the detachment's flagship, was joined in this task by Floriano, two cruisers, two destroyers, and the six vessels of Brazil's Amazon River flotilla.Scheina, Naval History, 92. On 19 April 1924, Brazil sold the ship to the Mexican Navy, where it was renamed An√°huac.Gardiner and Chesneau, Conway's 1922‚Äì46, 414. The Brazilians used the money gained (eight thousand contos) to purchase a submarine from Italy, .Scheina, Naval History, 136. No further upgrades were made to An√°huac in its remaining service life, and the Mexican Navy sold it for scrap in 1938.  Footnotes   Endnotes   Bibliography  * Brassey, TA, ed.

It is also classified as a LINER galaxy, a class of active galaxy defined by their spectral line emissions. NGC 4457 Is inclined by about 33¬∞. It was discovered by astronomer William Herschel on February 23, 1784. Despite being listed in the Virgo Cluster Catalog as VCC 1145, NGC 4457 is a member of the Virgo II Groups which form an extension of the Virgo cluster. NGC 4457 may have had a recent minor merger with another galaxy. On July 1 2020 an astronomical transient was discovered in NGC 4457 by astronomer Kiochi Itagaki and confirmed by ASAS-SN. Spectroscopic classification determined the object to be a Type Ia Supernova, SN 2020nvb SN 2020nvb TNS. Physical characteristics NGC 4457 has a broad oval zone containing an inner spiral which is defined mainly by two fairly open arms. There is a well- defined outer ring that is completely detached from the inner regions of the galaxy. =Truncated disk= NGC 4457 has a severely reduced amount of star- formation in its disk while its inner regions have a normalized rate of massive star formation.

It is the third part of a projected but unfinished cycle of works based on Hermann Broch‚Äôs novel The Death of Virgil, and uses texts written by the composer as well as extracts from the second book of Broch‚Äôs novel, in the French translation by Albert Kohn. A performance lasts about twenty-five minutes.  History  Chant apr√®s chant was composed rapidly, in just a few weeks, on a commission from Les Percussions de Strasbourg. It was premiered in the Palais des F√™tes at the Strasbourg Festival on 23 June 1966. The performers were Berthe Kal (soprano), Andr√© Krust (piano), and Les Percussions de Strasbourg, conducted by Charles Bruck. The manuscript score is not dated, but was finished late in April 1966. When the score was published in 1968, it bore a dedication to Madame Edouard Blivet, the daughter of Francine Le Faucheur. However, on 20 August 1970, Barraqu√© added to the manuscript score a dedication to Maria and Michel Bernstein . The first commercial recording was made in Copenhagen for Valois Records, from 20‚Äì23 December 1969, in the presence of the composer .  Analysis  The programme note written by Barraqu√© for the premiere begins: Acoustical resonance and visual images of light, sparks, and flashing glimpses are Barraqu√©‚Äôs focus here; so are Broch's characteristic paradoxes (e.g., \\"noch nicht und doch schon\\"‚Äînot yet, and yet already) play a central role here . As in the Concerto, the composer builds Chant apr√®s chant in seventeen phases but, in this case, after having completed the main structure, Barraqu√© added an additional opening section, ending with a cadenza for the piano and a first vocal line. The first phase occupies nearly a quarter of the total duration, and half of the work has elapsed by the time the fifth phase has finished. The second half of the work, therefore, hurries through the remaining twelve phases, sometimes presenting two simultaneously. Barraqu√© uses a rhythmic series of seventeen cells, and for the pitched structure applies his technique of \\"proliferating series\\" to two source rows: the basic row for the Mort de Virgile cycle, and the row from his Piano Sonata .

The monument was dismantled and removed in 2020. History The cornerstone of the Monument plinth was laid during the 1894 Reunion of United Confederate Veterans on Confederate Decoration Day, April 26. and contained a Bible and Confederate flag. The slab of rock was unused for several years, though a surplus artillery piece from the Spanish-American War of 1898 once rested on it. On May 29, 1896, The United Daughters of the Confederacy held a meeting to decide what to do with the plinth and, in 1900, raised money for construction of the obelisk. The 52 foot high monument was completed on April 27, 1905. In 2017, following widespread concern about the monument being a symbol of historic racism, the Birmingham city council erected a barrier surrounding the memorial, resulting in a lawsuit being brought against it by the state. In January 2019, an Alabama court declared unconstitutional the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act that prohibited \\"alteration\\" of the monument. The lower court's decision was reversed in November 2019 by the state Supreme Court, which upheld a fine of $25,000 against the city council. Following protests in 2020 after the killing of George Floyd, during which protestors damaged and tried to remove the monument, the city council removed the obelisk, leaving only the plinth. The state Attorney General responded by filing a new lawsuit against the city council saying the removal was in violation of the Alabama Memorial Preservation Act of 2017, a law passed specifically to prevent the removal of this monument. It was the most prominent Confederate monument in the state. The Alabama Attorney General filed suit against the city of Birmingham for violating the statute. Mayor Randall Woodfin said the expected $25,000 fine for removing the statue would be much more affordable than the cost of continued unrest in the city.

In operation by 1909 and abandoned by 1912, it offered service between the Illinois state capital of Illinois and the Sangamon County rural towns of Clear Lake and Rochester. Its active network was 11 miles (18 km) in length, with a 7-mile-long main line from Springfield to Rochester and a 4-mile-long branch line to what was then the excursion destination of Clear Lake. History The interurban line was incorporated in 1906. One year after going into operation, it was legally reorganized in 1910 as the Mississippi Valley Interurban Railway. Two years later it was no longer operating safely, and the Illinois Railroad and Warehouse Commission ordered in July 1912 that operations be suspended pending urgently required repairs to one or more railroad bridges. The original firm appears to have lacked means to repair the unsafe spans. Shortly after the suspension, separate promoter groups filed legal papers to recharter the \\"Springfield, Clear Lake and Southern Railway Company\\" (August 1912) and the \\"Mississippi Valley Traction Railway Company\\" (September 1912). The Springfield, Clear Lake & Southern promoters told the trade press they planned to work with creditors to acquire operating control of the struggling line by foreclosure, make necessary repairs, and build new trackage to the town of Riverton. However, nothing appears to have come of either charter, and the suspension evolved into abandonment.

The recent scholarly edition of Pendrick, however, sees it as probable that this treatise was written by the same author as the Sophistic works, as does the edition of Laks and Most. Some earlier scholars, though, including E. R. Dodds, take the view that Antiphon the dream-interpreter was a separate person.G.J. Pendrick, Antiphon the Sophist (2002) pp. 24‚Äì26A. Laks and G.W.

Vaccine research  Shaw has done controversial research on the adverse effects of vaccines, including publishing two 2011 reports about the effect of aluminum adjuvants in vaccines.Tomljenovic L, Shaw CA (2011). \\"Do aluminum vaccine adjuvants contribute to the rising prevalence of autism?\\" Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry. 105: 1489‚Äì1499.Tomljenovic L, Shaw CA (2011). \\"Aluminum vaccine adjuvants: are they safe?\\" Current Medicinal Chemistry. 18(17): 2630‚Äì2637. The World Health Organization's Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety criticized the two 2011 reports, calling them \\"seriously flawed\\". The Committee wrote: \\"The core argument made in these studies is based on ecological comparisons of aluminium content in vaccines and rates of autism spectrum disorders in several countries. In general, ecological studies cannot be used to assert a causal association because they do not link exposure to outcome in individuals, and only make correlations of exposure and outcomes on population averages\\".Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (2012). \\"Aluminum Adjuvants\\". Weekly Epidemiological Record. World Health Organization. 87(30): 277‚Äì288. Shaw has received nearly $900,000 in research funding from the Dwoskin Family Foundation and the Katlyn Fox Foundation, both of which question the safety of vaccines. The University of British Columbia and numerous experts said there is no problem with the source of this funding, noting that many researchers accept money from pharmaceutical companies and other entities. In October 2017, Shaw and his colleague, Lucija Tomljenovic, announced that they were retracting a paper they had co-authored in the Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry, claiming to find that aluminum in vaccines caused symptoms \\"consistent with those in autism\\" in mice, after multiple other researchers had criticized the underlying data as invalid or falsified. After seeing some of these criticisms on PubPeer, Shaw and his lab reanalyzed the figures that had been criticized, and requested a retraction from the journal, saying \\"It appears as if some of the images in mostly what were non- significant results had been flipped. We don't know why, we don't know how ‚Ä¶ but there was a screw-up, there's no question about that.\\" In response to this retraction, UBC issued a statement defending academic freedom as well as Shaw's academic integrity. In October 2017, Shaw and Tomljenovic and several other coauthors published an article in Open Access Library Journal, published by Scientific Research Publishing, a predatory open access publisher, about a tetanus vaccine that had been used in Kenya in 2014. The authors withdrew the article, then published it again in the same journal. Shaw is chair of the Scientific Advisory Board of the anti-vaccine Children's Medical Safety Research Institute, founded and funded by Claire Dwoskin. Dwoskin has used Shaw's studies, conducted at UBC, as supposed evidence that vaccines cause autism.

History Holland and Holland advertisement (1886) The ball and shot gun was invented by COL George Fosbery, VC, who in 1885 took out the English patent (patent number 7565) for a system of very shallow rifling in the chokes of smoothbore shotgun barrels. Fosbery immediately offered the patent to Holland and Holland, who bought it and from 1886 until 1899, when the patent expired, had exclusive rights to build this class of firearm, marketing it as the Paradox gun. After the expiry of the patent, most of Britain's larger firearm makers offered similar firearms, some retaining the name paradox gun, others opting for new names such as the Jungle gun, Colindian or Cosmos, although the most famous of these was the Westley Richards' Explora (for 12 bore and above) and Faucita (for 20 bore and 28 bore). Use The 8 bore and 10 bore guns were considered suitable for dangerous game, whilst the most common 12 bore was suitable for medium game. In his Thirty-seven years of big game shooting in Cooch Behar, the Duars, and Assam Nripendra Narayan, the Maharajah of Cooch Behar, states the 12 bore Paradox \\"is an excellent weapon for Tiger, Bear or Leopard at short ranges up to 100 yards.\\" In his African Rifles and Cartridges, John \\"Pondoro\\" Taylor wrote that the 8 bore and particularly the 10 bore ball and shot guns were popular as stand by backups to smaller calibre rifles for lion shooting. He states he used a paradox gun chiefly for shooting leopard, loading one barrel with a 750 gr solid lead bullet and the second with of buckshot. In his Wild Beasts and Their Ways, Sir Samuel Baker described the 12 bore paradox gun as \\"a most useful weapon ..... wonderfully accurate within a range of 100 yards\\" and that \\"the penetration and shock are most formidable\\". Harold G.C. Swayne used an 8 bore paradox gun by Holland & Holland extensively in Africa and India, in his Seventeen trips through Somalialand he states he believed it to be \\"the best weapon in the market for heavy game such as elephant or rhino.\\" =Great War service= In the early stages of the First World War, Holland and Holland paradox guns were pressed into service to combat the threat from Zeppelins. Holland and Holland developed a special 12 bore incendiary round, known as the \\"Holland Buckingham .707 inch Incendiary shell\\", designed to ignite the airship's hydrogen cells. At least 12 paradox guns were purchased by the Royal Naval Air Service for use by UK based patrol aircraft and they remained in use until suitable .303 British incendiary ammunition was developed.

It was established with the goal of defending Germany against Communist uprisings and foreign attacks, though it was also hostile to the Weimar Republic. It was based in Bavaria, where anti-Berlin and anti- republican sentiment attracted such activity. On June 29, 1921, the German government gave in to Allied demands and dissolved the Citizens' Defense. Its militants moved on to fight in other far-right paramilitaries with similar goals. Activity in Germany Units of the Citizens' Defense had existed throughout Germany since the revolution as a modification of the reactionary Freikorps militia with the purpose of quickly reinforcing cities against revolutionary forces by recruiting small groups of civilians. Its stronghold was its unit in Munich, Bavaria, led by Major Doctor Forstrat Escherich. This is in part because Bavarian nationalism and anti-republicanism flourished as many of its politicians, Army officers, and commoners desired a restoration of the House of Wittelsbach monarchy in defiance of Berlin. For example, a 1919 order from the Bavarian Department of the Interior stated that the attitude of the Bavarian administration towards the Citizens' Defense should be that of \\"advisers and supporters.\\" In addition, Bavarian Minister-President Gustav von Kahr protected the Citizens' Defense by telling the British ambassador that there was \\"no militarism in the idea.\\".SA commander and close Hitler ally Ernst R√∂hm was a notable commander in the Bavarian Citizens' Defense. Due to its success in Bavaria, the units of the Citizens' Defense were organized in May 1920 by Bavarian Citizens' Defense leader Forstrat Escherich into a unified national force called the \\"Orgesch,\\" or Organisation Escherich. The Citizens' Defense was supported and supplied by the government, the Reichswehr, and the Freikorps. The Weimar regime became worried that its defense was being entrusted to the far right, and in September 1919 issued a call to its supporters to join the Citizens' Defense. This was not successful and the regime did not pursue the issue. After the failed Kapp Putsch of 1920, the Citizens' Defense was ordered dissolved, but Bavaria refused, keeping its unit in existence for another year. In October 1920, to partially appease Allied demands, the Citizens' Defense surrendered one-third to half of their rifles. On the European Stage Though the Citizens' Defense was involved in internal struggle, it soon became entangled in foreign conflict. Indeed, many of its leaders saw its primary purpose as providing defense for Germany's frontiers. In March of 1921, the Allies, citing the Treaty of Versailles, demanded the dissolution of the illegal paramilitary and occupied two German cities along the Rhine. But Germany did not disband it. That same month, German Communists attempted a short-lived revolt. And in May, Germany sent the Citizens' Defense to help crush a Polish uprising in the important coal province of Upper Silesia. (The fighting had been brought about by the controversy over the results of the plebiscite that had been held there to determine whether Upper Silesia would be controlled by Germany or Poland.) Dissolution All these conflicts may have given the Berlin government justification for the Citizens' Defense. But Germany was hoping to negotiate a more lenient peace deal with the Allies and did not believe resistance to France and Britain would be successful anyway. The German government was replaced in May. The new government was determined to cooperate with the Allies, in the hopes that this would help them achieve a better peace. So on June 29, 1921, Germany officially dissolved the Citizens' Defense, and the Bavarian government, beginning to fear the goals of the paramilitary, allowed it, though Gustav von Kahr soon resigned as Bavarian Minister-President. Disbanded Citizens' Defense militants went on to join other far-right paramilitaries, like the Bund Bayern und Reich (\\"League for Bavaria and Empire\\"), the chief successor organization of the Citizens' Defense.

He represented several high-profile clients, including president Warren G. Harding, oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny, and banker Andrew Mellon. As ABA president he created the association's Committee on the Bill of Rights and supported the controversial Walter-Logan bill. In 1938, Hogan denounced racial and religious intolerance in a half-hour speech aimed at fellow Catholics; the speech was aired on the same 34 radio stations used by the notoriously antisemitic priest, Charles Coughlin, immediately following Coughlin's regular broadcast.  Early life and education  Hogan was born to Maurice Hogan and Mary E. (McSweeney) Hogan in Brooklyn, New York, on January 12, 1877. His father died when Hogan was five years old, leaving his mother to support three children on a seamstress's wages. In the 1880s, the family moved to Charleston, South Carolina, where they lived with Mary's sister. Hogan grew up in a household run by two widowed women, along with his cousin James F. Byrnes, who went on to become governor of South Carolina. At 12, Hogan left school to work as a stockboy in a local store. A stenographer taught him how to write in shorthand, a skill that proved to be valuable throughout his career. He became a stenographer himself and then worked as a railway clerk, a brokerage clerk, and a reporter for a local newspaper. In his spare time, he schooled himself by reading books recommended by friends. In 1898, he joined the US Army and put his clerical and railway experience to work in logistics, serving as secretary to the Chief Quartermaster of the Army, secretary to the Quartermaster General in Washington, and Secretary to the Chief of Staff of the Army. After work, he would spend his evenings studying law at Georgetown University. He completed the three-year program in two years, graduating at the head of his class in 1902.  Law career  After his graduation, Hogan went into private practice. At first he practiced law part-time in the evenings while he worked for the War Department during the day. He cofounded a Washington law firm, Hogan & Hartson, in 1904. From 1912 to 1919, he lectured at Georgetown University on the law of wills, evidence, and partnership. Hogan rose to national fame working on several high-profile cases in the 1920s and the 1930s. His most notable case was his defense of oil tycoon Edward L. Doheny and the Pan- American Petroleum and Transport Company in a series of trials from 1924 to 1930. In what came to be known as the Teapot Dome scandal, Doheny was accused of bribing Interior Secretary Albert Fall to lease the oil production rights at Elk Hills Oil Field. The company was forced to cancel its lease, but Hogan succeeded in clearing Doheny on charges of bribery and conspiracy to defraud the government. In 1935 he successfully defended Andrew Mellon on charges of tax evasion. Other clients included former President Warren Harding, the General Electric Company, Armour & Co., and Swift & Co. He appeared on the cover of Time magazine in 1935. Reportedly, he once said that \\"the best client is a rich man who is scared.\\"  American Bar Association  From 1930 to 1931, Hogan served as president of the Washington Lawyers' Club, and from 1932 to 1933, he was president of the District of Columbia Bar Association. In 1932, he organized the entertainment for the ABA when it held its 55th annual meeting in Washington, DC, and so became interested in its national organization. He was elected to its Executive Committee in 1933, served on the Budget Committee, and helped to create the ABA's House of Delegates in 1936. He became the first DC lawyer to serve as president of the ABA when he was unanimously elected in 1938. During his tenure, he created the Committee on the Bill of Rights. Among other things, it filed an amicus brief in Hague v. Committee for Industrial Organization, an important case on freedom of assembly. Hogan also supported the conservative Walter-Logan bill, which was passed by Congress and would have imposed strict constraints on federal administrative agencies if it had not been vetoed by Franklin Roosevelt. A precursor to the Administrative Procedure Act, the bill was criticized by some as an attempt to undermine the New Deal.  1938 radio address  On December 11, 1938, under the auspices of the General Jewish Council, Hogan denounced racial and religious intolerance in a half-hour speech aimed at fellow Catholics. Titled \\"An American Catholic Speaks on Intolerance,\\" Hogan's speech was interpreted as a rebuke of Charles Coughlin, an anti-Semitic priest whose weekly radio broadcasts were attracting millions of listeners across the country. Although Hogan did not mention Coughlin by name, the implication was clear since his speech was aired on the same 34 radio stations used by Coughlin immediately following Coughlin's regular broadcast. > Upon the unquestionable authority of Pius the Eleventh as given to the world > in his public utterances, I speak today to refute any idea that any one who > preaches racial or religious intolerance speaks for the Catholic laymen or > the Catholic priesthood.... [O]ne hate breeds another. Wherever Jews are > persecuted, there too other creeds and races will sooner or later be > persecuted. This was true of the Ku Klux Klan in our own country, the Klan > whose hatred was not limited to Catholics, but included Jews and Negroes as > well. One thing is becoming ever more clear to serious students of history. > That the Jews have become the barometer of democracy throughout the world. > Where they are oppressed, as in Germany, democracy and freedom have been > utterly destroyed, and Christians have also suffered. Where they are the > equals of all other citizens, as in America, democracy lives and flourishes, > and all men are free whatever their faith. The speech was widely quoted in newspapers the next day. The full text was reprinted in the Pittsburgh Press. Personal life  Hogan married Mary Cecile Adair of Savannah, Georgia, in 1899; they had a daughter, Dorothy. In addition to his professional work, Hogan served for a time as vice president of the Shakespeare Association of America. He also collected rare books and manuscripts, which he kept in a library on the top floor of his home. By the time of his death, the Frank J. Hogan Library was one of the world's most valuable private collections. The books were sold at auction in New York in 1945 and 1946. After completing his term as president of the ABA, he was forced to retire because of poor health. He was diagnosed with the early stages of Parkinson's disease in 1938, and his health steadily declined after that. Hogan died at his home in Washington, DC, on May 15, 1944, after a long illness.  Awards  Hogan received a commendation from the Secretary of War, Newton D. Baker, for his pro-bono services to veterans of World War I. His honorary degrees included an LL.D. from Georgetown University (1925), LL.D. from Laval University (1929), D.C.L. from the University of Southern California (1939), and LL.D. from Manhattan College (1939). At a special service in Jerusalem in 1931, he received an award of the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.

Official statistics of homelessness in the Netherlands are collected by Statistics Netherlands and do not include numbers of people who live in the Netherlands who are homeless, but do not have legal immigration status in the country. Housing solutions Several organizations in the Netherlands, like the Salvation Army, offer places to stay for a night. Reasons that many homeless people do not want to sleep in shelters, sometimes even when it freezes, include high drunkenness among residents, fighting, screaming, sexual harassment, and stealing of personal properties by residents of shelters. Homeless people sleep in the streets, alleys, under bridges, in fields, dunes, along highways, in forests or illegally enter buildings. The number of outside dwellers is higher in the summer than in the winter, when additional places are offered in the shelters. It is illegal to sleep without a permit on property that isn't one's own, so homeless people regularly get fined.

The east building was originally constructed as the Winona High School from 1915 to 1917 and the west building was added as the Winona Junior High School in 1926. An auditorium was added to the rear of the east building in 1928. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as the Winona High School and Winona Junior High School in 2004 for having local significance in the theme of education. It was nominated for representing local efforts to implement progressive educational trends in updated facilities, while offering cultural experiences to the wider community through professional music performances in the auditorium. An adaptive reuse project completed in 2004 converted the former school into the Washington Crossing apartments. Construction Winona's original high school was built on the site of the west building in 1887. By the early 20th century the student body had swollen to twice the intended capacity of the building, pushing instructional spaces into the attic, basement, and stairwells. The Winona Board of Education began planning a new high school in 1913, purchasing the neighboring lot across Washington Street and ultimately hiring architect Clarence H. Johnston Sr. of Saint Paul, who had recently designed what is now Phelps Hall at Winona State University. The board also took the opportunity to incorporate the latest trends in education, such as classrooms for both academic and vocational training, and large windows for maximum sunlight (which was considered to promote student health and cleanse classrooms). Construction began in September 1915 and the district's 10th, 11th, and 12th grades moved into the new building in February 1917. The 1887 building was adapted for another new educational trend, the junior high school, created to provide more of a transition for students between elementary and high school. Initially only eighth and ninth grade met there, leaving seventh grade at the elementary school. In 1922 the board of education prioritized construction of a new junior high school building on the site of the old. The firm of Croft & Boerner was hired, with William B. Ittner of St. Louis as a consulting architect. The new facility was designed to complement the high school across the street. Construction began in February 1925, with half the building complete and available for classes in September of that year and the other half ready in January 1926. The district's next priority project was a gymnasium, another reflection of new educational principles. William B. Ittner was hired back to design a combined gymnasium and auditorium, with a swimming pool in the basement. Again it was closely matched to the style and color of the existing facilities. Construction began in summer 1927 and was complete in December of the following year. Changing use In 1967 the Winona Senior High School was constructed at 901 Gilmore Avenue, and both buildings on Broadway became the Winona Junior High School. In 1988 the junior high school was renamed the Winona Middle School as ninth grade was shifted to the new high school and sixth grade moved in from the elementary school. However the facility was noticeably aging, lacked space for athletic fields, and was awkwardly split into two buildings. Whether to renovate or relocate proved to be a contentious local issue for years. Two referendums to renovate the existing facilities were defeated, but a referendum to construct a new middle school passed in 1997. Proposals for what to do with the existing school buildings included reuse for subsidized housing, a university dormitory, a teen community center, or expansion space for the adjacent Winona Public Library. A special task force ultimately voted in 1998 to sell the buildings to MetroPlains, a Saint Paul-based redeveloper, for conversion into affordable housing. Meanwhile, the new Winona Middle School was constructed at 1570 Homer Road. The final day of classes in the old school was June 7, 2000. That fall, as students began attending the new middle school, renovation work was delayed when the Winona County Courthouse flooded and the west school building was pressed into service to house county offices. Renovations to convert the old middle school into the Washington Crossing apartment complex ultimately took place from July 2003 to October 2004, and new tenants began moving in that December. Auditorium The Washington Crossing renovation did not include the 1928 auditorium/gymnasium attached to the east building, and it has sat vacant since 2000. Pipes burst over the winter have left standing water in the auditorium's balcony and in front of the stage, though the facility remains structurally sound. Options for reuse, however, are complicated by the fact that the city has already restored the Winona Masonic Temple into a community theater space just a block away.

History =Early Years and Formation= The band's founding members, Ryan Steffes and Ethan Langston, met in Athens, GA during their first year attending the University of Georgia in 2013. Steffes had lined up an opening gig at the local Athens venue \\"New Earth Music Hall\\" (now called Live Wire Athens) and put together a band to back him up which included Ethan Langston and Ally Brady. Following the show, Steffes asked the group if they would be interested in forming a band, which led to its creation. For several months, the band debated numerous names before finally deciding on The Welcome Home, a title formulated by Steffes. A few months later, in November 2014, the group officially added Ethan‚Äôs brother, Lane Langston, as its lead electric guitarist. And after working with temporary drummers for several months, the band added local Athens drummer, Alec Parrish, to its official lineup. =2014-2015: A Land Outside of This= In the summer of 2015, the band recorded its first studio EP, titled ‚ÄúA Land Outside of This,‚Äù consisting of 5 original songs, preceded by an intro track. The release was accepted exceptionally online, as the band saw streaming numbers grow quickly on music platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music. This led to fan bases starting elsewhere in the country, and in some cases outside the country, as they saw reviews coming in from elsewhere in the world. Somewhat constrained by their university-related commitments, the band mostly played shows in Atlanta and Athens during the A Land Outside of This album cycle. This led to several opportunities in their hometown, such as being featured on the University of Georgia‚Äôs primary hype video for senior day, the final home football game of the 2015 season. =2016-Present: Remember the Monarchs (Acoustic), New Studio Releases, and Lineup Changes= As the band‚Äôs following continued to grow, they joined bigger acts in Athens‚Äô premier venues such as the Georgia Theatre and the 40 Watt Club. In the summertime of 2016, the group was featured on the main stage at the Athens based festival, Athfest, and on the festival‚Äôs annual compilation CD along with legendary Athens bands such as R.E.M. and Drive-By Truckers. They also self-recorded and released an acoustic version of their biggest hit and single from the first EP, Remember the Monarchs. Since then, the band has been working on writing and recording new music, which is set to release in the next several months. In mid 2017, the band experienced two major personnel changes. In May, the group announced that their long-time keyboardist and vocalist, Ally Brady, would be leaving the band for personal reasons, as she transitioned into a new stage of life. In October, the band's long-time drummer, Alec Parrish, announced that he would be leaving the band to pursue other drumming-related goals,https://www.instagram.com/p/BaT9jrgj6t9/ leaving the band's lineup solely consisting of Steffes and the Langston brothers.

Before it became a book, it was a radio program script (1974). In 1985, the script was adapted into a book and published. The main character, Majid, is an orphan who lives with his grandmother in the city of Kerman, Iran. The book includes 39 chapters detailing the adventures, misadventures, and coming-of-age milestones from the perspective of this Iranian teenager attending the first year of high school. Majid works in a bakery during the summer and sometimes after school in order to supplement the money that his grandmother receives from her deceased husband's retirement funds. There are some similarities between the fictional character, Majid, and Kermani. For example, Majid is an orphan, while in real life, Kermani lost his mother when he was young. Additionally, Majid and Kermani do not have any siblings and lived in poverty while growing up. It was in this state of solitude and loneliness that Kermani began to write.  Chapters  = Book Lover = In this chapter, Majid is introduced to his first novel by chance. While running an errand for his grandmother, BiBi, Majid is given some dry goods wrapped in a paper funnel. When he gets home, BiBi gives the paper funnel to Majid and instructs him to throw it away in the trash. Before he does, Majid notices the paper funnel is really part of a book. He reads the novel, _Escape to the Mountains_ , with enthusiasm. He is devastated when he comes to the end of his section and realizes that the rest of the book is missing. He goes back to the dry goods store to talk to the owner in order to get the rest of the book. However, the owner, Mashasdollah, is disinterested in helping Majid recover the rest of the book. To gain favor with Mashasdollah, Majid begins to tidy up the store. Unfortunately, Majid accidentally blows salt into Mashasdollah's eyes. While Mashasdollah's eyes are burning, Majid tries to remedy the situation by fetching a bowl of water to wash them out. Unable to see, Mashasdollah knocks the bowl of water over, soaking a sack full of sugar cubes. At the end of the chapter, Majid does not recover the end of the novel, despite searching for it in every bookstore in town. Instead, he tries to imagine how the story ended and writes down his own versions. He frequents the bookstores regularly and is allowed to rent books for a nominal sum. Thus, Majid is so changed by his encounter with his first novel that he becomes a book lover. = Cat = BiBi is an animal lover and her household includes a white kitten, named Cutie, and a cage of nightingales. She insists that Majid always treat the animals with kindness, but one day when BiBi was out, Majid decides to mess with the birds. When he hears the front door open, Majid is stunned and accidentally drops the cage, injuring the birds. To cover up his fault, Majid blames Cutie, saying that she wanted to eat the birds. BiBi tells Majid to find Cutie another home, as she puts the cat into Majid's hands. Majid tries to find an acceptable place with owners who love to pet cats at night, who keep lots of creamy milk in their house, and who eat lots of meat. Unable to find a deserving place, Majid returns home, confessing to BiBi that it was his fault that the cage fell. = Woolen Jacket = Majid has a new teacher. During his introduction, the teacher delivers an inspiring speech, saying that he himself lost his dad at a young age, but that adversity should not an obstacle preventing students from going to college. Majid is so touched by this speech that he comments that if that story is true, count him as a future college student. He then offers the teacher for his grandmother to make him a woolen jacket. The teacher jokingly accepts; however, Majid takes his words seriously. Comedic elements are enhanced when Majid tries to secretly obtain the teacher's measurements by sneaking up behind him with pieces of yarn in hand. After a few unsuccessful attempts, Majid decides to nab an old sweater from the clothesline in the teacher's yard. BiBi uses this old sweater to get the teacher's measurements. Majid returns the old sweater to the teacher's clothesline a few days later, but not until the teacher catches a cold due to a lack of his winter-wear. At the end of the chapter, Majid presents the sweater to the teacher, but the teacher is angered and refuses to accept the sweater. The teacher decides to have a conference with BiBi. He accepts the sweater, but tells Majid to never do that again. = Drum = At the beginning of this chapter, Majid explains that he is infatuated with playing the drum or tabl, but has never gotten the chance to. One day, he asks his neighbor if he could play his drum, but the neighbor refuses stating, \\"drums are not for kids\\". Majid can't afford to buy his own drum, so he decides to secretly sneak into his neighbor's shed, where the drum is kept, in order to play it softly. While in the shed, he becomes so carried away that he begins to play the drum loud enough for his neighbor's wife to hear the drum. Fortunately for Majid, when she comes to the shed, a chicken runs across her path, making her think that the sound of the drum was the work of the chicken. Unfortunately for Majid, she locks the shed door, trapping Majid in the small room with the drum. Eventually, temptation wins and Majid is playing the drum with the drumstick so loudly that people have gathered in the yard, thinking that an evil demon is in the shed, banging on the drum. With clubs in hand and the word \\"besmallah\\" on their lips, a group of tough guys come to investigate what is in the shed, only to run away screaming when Majid yells out, \\"I am Majid\\". Eventually, the shed door is unlocked and the people watch Majid exit, anticipating instead to see a demon. = Invitation = In this chapter, Majid learns the lesson not to judge people based on their appearances. At the beginning of the chapter, Majid and BiBi are getting ready to attend a party. Majid realizes that it will be several hours before BiBi is ready, so he asks for permission to go out, wearing his nice, party clothes. He barrows a bicycle from a friend and heads downtown to see the movie posters in front of the cinema. While downtown, he runs into a friend whose family helped Majid and BiBi a great deal after Majid's parents died. He is so happy to see his friend, that he falls off his bike, dirtying his pants and skinning his hands, abdomen, and leg. He invites his friend to a swank ice cream parlor nearby. The two boys are having a great time eating faloodeh and catching up, when Majid realizes he doesn't have any money in his pocket. He left his spending money in his other pair of pants. Majid examines the shop owner to anticipate what will happen when he tells him he doesn't have any money. Majid describes him as fearful looking with thick arms, a thick neck, tattoos, and a face resembling Shimr (or Shemr), the warrior who killed Husayn ibn-Ali in the Battle of Karbala. Majid anticipates that the shop owner will pummel him over the head when he finds out that Majid ordered desserts, but has no money. Majid's guest notices a sudden change in Majid's demeanor, but Majid dismisses it with the comical line, \\"Sometimes I get dizzy when I eat faloodeh. Some people have that problem\\". To make matters worse for Majid, Majid's guest suggests that they also order some ice cream to follow the faloodeh. Even though his friend offers to pay for the ice cream, Majid insists that a guest should never pay. After all, it was Majid who extended the invitation. After the ice cream arrives, Majid begins to cry under the table, trying to pretend that he needs to tie his shoe lace. When Majid's friend looks him in the eye, he asks what happened to his eyes. Majid replies, \\"Sometimes my eyes burn when I eat ice cream. Some people have that problem.\\" When it comes time for Majid to confront the owner about not having any money, he starts babbling about how the bicycle isn't really his, so please don't take it and how his socks should be worth a good deal of money because it is the first time he has worn them, and that if the owner wants to hit him on the head, please do so out of the view of his guest who is waiting across the street. When the shop owner asks Majid to tell him what this is all about, Majid blurts out that he left his money at home, but he invited a friend to eat dessert. The owner laughs loudly and tells Majid to bring the money he owes when he has a chance. At that point, Majid considers the owner to be the kindest soul on earth. Majid says good-bye to his friend, bikes home to get his money, and returns to the ice cream parlor to pay his bill. = The Third Barber = Majid convinces BiBi to let him grow his hair out during the summer break. After a few episodes of chasing Majid around the house with shears in hand, BiBi reluctantly agrees. However, on the first day of school, the principal sees Majid and tells him he must get a haircut. After school, Majid goes to the local barber only to be told that the shop is now closed. Before he leaves, Majid hears the barber complain to another man of the low-lifes who have been coming in lately, only able to pay the barber a small amount of money. Majid realizes that the shop wasn't really closing - the barber was refusing to cut Majid's hair. He goes off to a cheaper barber, only to be treated like a third-class customer and have his hair cut so that his head resembles a corn cob. When he returns home, BiBi is mortified by Majid's appearance. They set out for a third barber who treats Majid like a little king, mends his cuts he received from the second barber, and trims his hair with precision. BiBi sings his praises, but is surprised by the huge amount he wants to charge them. BiBi pays what she is able to pay. = Samovar = BiBi and her friends agree to buy a samovar as a wedding gift for a young woman. Due to their economic situation, they must pool their resources in order to afford to buy a beautiful, copper samovar. On the day the women set out to present it to the new bride, they ask Majid to transport it on his bike. Because the elderly women walk so slow, Majid arrives at the house before the women. He decides to pass the time by visiting his aunt. When he arrives with the samovar, she mistakenly thinks that the samovar is for her. She begins to sing Majid's praises and recounts all the times she helped to raise him and feed him. She even tells him about a dream she had where an angel brings her a gift. Majid is too ashamed to tell her the truth - that the samovar is really for someone else. Thus, he leaves the samovar with his elderly aunt as though he really brought it for her. In order to cover up the fact that the gift had been given to someone else, he peddles home, grabs BiBi's samovar, and arrives at the bride's house after the women have arrived. He later tells BiBi what happened. The women explain to the bride what happened and bring another, new samovar to her later on. = Trip = = The Picture Memento = = Wishes = = Bicycle = = Essay- writer = = Ball = = Travelogue to Esfahan = = Prayer Beads = = The 100-Toman Bill = = The Innocent Child = = Gift for Nowruz = = The Close-Tongued = = Baby's Navel = = Fish = = Dream-Inspired = = Mule = = Encouragement = = Creditor = = Schoolmaster = = Watermelon = = Fame = = Camp = = Shovel = = Abgusht = = Tie = = Tailor = = Bookish = = Bread = = Mustache = = Grade = = Fight = = Mirror to the Past =  Tales of Majid Radio Show  In an interview with Tebyan.net, Kermani described how the Tales of Majid became a regular radio show. In March 1974, Kermani was writing for a radio station. His bosses wanted a story that was appropriate to air during the Persian New Year. Kermani said that he had a story about a boy who was an orphan and lived with his grandmother. His bosses said it wasn't suitable, but Kermani persisted and described it as a humor piece. Originally, it wasn't supposed to be a series, but it ended up being close to 130 episodes.  Tales of Majid Mini-series  The book inspired a television mini-series directed by Iranian director Kiumars Purahmad. The series debuted in 1990 and was shown on Friday afternoons. It became popular among children and adults alike. The series based on the book was one of the most-watched mini-series in Iran after the Islamic Revolution. Mehdi Bagherbigi was chosen to play the part of Majid out of more than 500 boys who were screened for the role by Kiumars Purahmad. Parvin Dokht Yazdanian, Purahmad's own mother, was selected to play Bibi, Majid's grandmother, after Purahmad screened 20 other older women for the part. There are some subtle differences between the book and the mini-series including the fact that in the book, Majid is living in Kerman, while the mini-series has Esfahan as Majid's place of residence. Moradi stated that he wanted the production to take place in Kerman because Kermanis consider _Tales of Majid_ to be a product of Kerman.

It is the first long-run show with original content in Japan.  History  GEAR was first created by Art Complex in Osaka as a project of the Osaka Regional Arts and Cultural Promotion Project Plan. After several successful runs promoted by different cultural affairs agencies in the Kansai region, it opened as a long run show in a specially designated theatre in downtown Kyoto in April 2012. It is currently in its fifth year of performances.  Content  GEAR follows four robots who work in a falling- apart toy factory in the distant future. An electrical accident brings one of the dolls they manufacture to life, and Doll and Robots learn together the value of play and humanity. Each robot discovers a special skill they have, and so the show gradually incorporates mime, juggling, breakdance, and magic. Much of the design for GEAR, costumes and visual style is by Kyoto-based Manga artist Akihiro Yamada, which lends an idiosyncratic look to the show. Another distinguishing mark of GEAR is the extensive use of stage technology. Projection mapping is used extensively, as are lasers, an LED dress, and moving lighting. In the words of Japan Times reviewer Andrew Eglinton: > In contrast, the production was lent a particularly powerful dimension > through projection-mapping technology that allowed the crew to project light > and video designs onto isolated parts of the Modernist factory to create the > impression of a futuristic, automated world. > In ‚ÄúGear,‚Äù though, projection-mapping animates the space and enables fast- > paced scene changes, and is also used to turn audience members into mapping > surfaces to conjure a remarkable holistic experience.

The area consists of the mouth of a fjord, some islands, and a headland. The dominant landscape type is a large, well-developed, and diverse beach meadow community, especially south of Livsneset and around Storholmen. Behind the beach meadows there is damp heath that transitions into a nutrient- poor bog. It has rich and varied vegetation. There are no species on the national red list, but many of them are regionally rare or endangered: herbaceous seepweed (Suaeda maritima), Ray's knotweed (Polygonum oxyspermum subsp. raii), media sandspurry (Spergularia media), and slenderleaf pondweed (Stuckenia filiformis).

It was incorporated in 2008 as a public-private partnership between the Government of Sri Lanka and five private companies, and is notable for being the first public-private research institute in the country. In 2017, it was accredited as a degree-awarding institution by the Ministry of Higher Education and Highways, leading to the establishment of the SLINTEC Academy. Background The idea of a national science policy for Sri Lanka was first discussed in the 1980s, although the matter did not move forward in any concrete way for several decades due to the more pressing economic and budgetary needs of the civil war on successive administrations. Nevertheless, a presidential taskforce was appointed in 1991 to examine possible policy actions to be taken in the field of the sciences. Further advancements came some years later, when the Science and Technology Act No. 11 of 1994 established, among others, the National Science Foundation (NSF; formally founded in 1998 for funding scientific research in the country) and the National Science and Technology Commission (NASTEC; formally founded in August 1998 to formulate scientific policy) under the newly established Ministry of Science and Technology (MoST). Despite these efforts, R&D; investments in the country were minimal, being just 0.19% GDP in 2006 (0.11% in 2008), lower than regional peers such as India (0.61%) and Malaysia (0.63%), and generally holding at <0.2% through the years. This has been attributed to various factors, including a lack of an innovation culture in Sri Lanka and a risk- averse private sector that did not see much benefit in local R&D; ventures. Sri Lanka has thus underperformed significantly in increasing the share of high technology exports as a percentage of its total manufactured exports when compared to regional peers such as India. History The National Nanotechnology Initiative was formed informally in the early 2000s as a collaborative effort between a group of expatriate Sri Lankan scientists and officials from the NSF and the MoST, seeking to promote nanotechnology research in Sri Lanka. The Initiative cited several other related objectives: *developing nanotechnology-based industry in Sri Lanka *attracting nanotechnology expertise of Sri Lankans both in the country and outside it *increasing the competitiveness of local industry through local R&D; *value addition to national resources slated for exports *developing a local skills base centered around nanotechnology. The Initiative approached the minister of science and technology at the time, Tissa Vitharana, going on to brief the president in a presentation in November 2005. This resulted in a cabinet memorandum the same year, proposing the formal commitment of the Government of Sri Lanka to the initiative, which was approved by the cabinet on 23 August 2006. It defined a broad objective of generating a pool of experts with all necessary facilities for nanotechnology-based research at a national level. Due to a lack of funds, however, the project stagnated until the efforts of Ravi Silva, a Sri Lankan professor and nanotechnology specialist at the University of Surrey, who persuaded five private companies to consider investing in the venture. The Ministry of Science and Technology announced a public-private partnership to establish a nanotechnology venture in 2007 with a holding company, NANCO (Pvt.) Ltd., being founded soon after. SLINTEC (through NANCO) was established with the state owning a 50% stake via an initial investment of LKR 250 million through the National Science Foundation, and five private sector partners each investing LKR 40 million and owning 10% stakes for a total seed capital of LKR 450 million. X-ray photoelectron spectrometer, scanning electron microscope and a transmission electron microscope, as well as office space SLINTEC was incorporated as a private company in April 2008. In September of that year, the Board of Investment signed an agreement with NANCO for the development and management of a nanotechnology park in Homagama. SLINTEC was launched officially on 1 December 2008, with initial work taking place in a garage; formal research work commenced on 12 August 2009, operating out of MAS Holdings' Silueta complex within the Biyagama Export Processing Zone, with research staff drawn from local universities. In 2010, NANCO was merged into SLINTEC. The construction of phase 1a of the Nanotechnology Center for Excellence on 50 acres of land within the Homagama Nanotechnology and Science Park began in June 2012, with the hexagonal facility formally opening on 21 October 2013. It currently houses both SLINTEC and the SLINTEC Academy, and a second hexagon is slated for completion by 2019. In 2013, Lankem joined SLINTEC as its sixth private sector partner. The greenhouse complex within the nanotechnology park In 2016, the Yunnan Rural Science and Technology Service Center helped establish a greenhouse within the Nanotechnology Park for use by SLINTEC. =Private sector collaboration= In March 2012, SLINTEC signed two commercial agreements: *One with Nagarjuna Fertilizers and Chemicals Ltd. (NFCL), India. Funded by the agrochemicals arm of its private sector partner Hayleys, SLINTEC had undertaken research into a nanoparticle-based slow-release fertilizer that reduced fertilizer loss through leaching, microbial degradation and other methods (accounting for between 50-70% of conventional fertilizer wastage). NFCL bought the patent for the slow-release fertilizer for US$2.2 million, acquiring rights for commercial production and distribution outside Sri Lanka. As part of the agreement, NFCL invested a further US$0.8 million as a seed fund for SLINTEC to develop second- and third-generation nanotechnology-based fertilizer products for NFCL. *Another with LAUGFS Holdings, wherein the two companies would establish a pilot plant to produce titanium dioxide from the country's large ilmenite mineral sands reserves, ranked 9th in the world at close to 18 million metric tonnes. The venture was based on SLINTEC research initially funded by the Ministry of Technology and Research and the National Science Foundation, drawing a LKR 80 million investment from LAUGFS. Other private sector clients of SLINTEC include MAS Holdings, Teejay Lanka PLC (formerly Textured Jersey), CIC Holdings, British Cosmetics (who launched a new product range in June 2018 based on research carried out by SLINTEC) and Dynawash (introducing a new, environmentally friendly natural textile dyeing technology using biomass pigments). Reduced Graphene Oxide Produced by SLINTEC Process Ceylon Graphene Technologies (Pvt) Ltd, a joint venture of LOLC Group and SLINTEC that aims to place Sri Lanka in the global market for graphene and associated products, was established in June 2018. =COVID-19-related technologies= In April 2020, SLINTEC announced that its scientists were able to reverse engineer the COVID-19 testing swabs and they have started manufacturing test kits consisting of Nasopharyngeal swabs and Oropharyngeal (Throat) swabs at a production capacity of 3,000 specimen collection kits per day.

It covers parts of the contemporary Northern Zhejiang and Southern Jiangsu. The capital of Wu commandery was Wu (today's Suzhou). Major counties of Wu commandery include Wu (county), Yuhang county, and Huating county which later became known as Suzhou, Hangzhou and Shanghai.  History  During its existence, Wu commandery was ruled by various dynasties and regimes. Chronologically, Han dynasty, Eastern Wu, Jin dynasty, Liu Song dynasty, Southern Qi dynasty, Liang dynasty, Chen dynasty, Sui dynasty and Tang dynasty governed Wu commandery in sequence. In the year of 129, Wu commandery was established during the reign of emperor Shun of Han. When Kuaiji Commandery was divided, lands west of Qiantang river in Kuaiji commandery formed the new Wu commandery. After the division of Kuaiji, Wu constitutes one of the commanderies of Yang Province. In 195, local strongman of Fuchun county Sun Ce acquired the entire Wu commandery without the authorization of Han dynasty. His family ruled the commandery until 280. The last ruler of Sun clan Sun Hao divided a part of Wu commandery and formed the new Wuxing Commandery. In 548, Military leader Hou Jing started an open rebellion against Emperor Wu of Liang. Wu Commandery was occupied by Hou's army during his rebellion. Local lords Lu Xiang, Lu An and Lu Yingong of Lu clan were defeated. Xiang died out of fear and anger. The rebels caused great damage to the commandery's economy. It was recorded that, in Wu, human bodies were eaten as rations of the rebels. In 589, Emperor Wen of Sui abolished the commandery system and substituted it with \\"Zhou\\"(administrative division). Consequently Wu commandery was renamed as Suzhou. However, In 607, Emperor Yang of Sui re-established Wu commandery. In 758. Wu commandery was once more renamed Suzhou. Wu commandery ceased to exist nominally in 758 and continued to exist under the name of Suzhou. Shortly after the An Lushan Rebellion, the imperial court enforced heavy taxes on the people of Wu commandery since Wu was not invaded by An's army. However, the tax collection became unbearable for the ordinary peasants of the commandery (An amount of tax that was equivalent to 8 years of laboring was demanded). In 762, a low rank officer of Taizhou Yuan Chao, with angry peasants, stormed and attacked cities of Wu commandery including Suzhou. The Tang court had to pacify Yuan's unexpected rebellion in 763. Yuan was captured by Li Guangbi and was escorted to the capital Chang'An. He was soon executed under the charge of treason.  Subordinate Counties  * Wu County: Administrative centre of Wu cammandery. Shares the same name with the commandery. Today's Suzhou. * Haiyan County: Still exists today under this name as a subordinate county of Jiaxing prefecture. In 549, Hou Jing established Wuyuan Commandery in this county. Shortly afterward, the Wuyuan Commandery was abolished and Haiyan returned to the administration of Wu. * Wucheng County: Today's Huzhou. In 266, Sun Hao established the Wuxing Commandery which included this county. No longer a part of Wu after 266. It was the capital of Wuxing commandery. * Yuhang County: Today's Hangzhou. Later formed a part of Wuxing Commandery and thus no longer belonged to Wu. * Piling County: Today's Changzhou. * Dantu County: Today's Zhenjiang. * Qu'e county: Today's Danyang. * Youquan County: Today's Jiaxing. Changed its name to Jiaxing in 231 according to the decree issued by Sun Quan. * Fuchun County: Today's Fuyang district of Hangzhou. In 225, this county became a commandery, the Dong'an Commandery. Dong'an was soon abolished in 228. * Yangxian County: Today's Yixing, later became a part of Wuxing Commandery. * Wuxi County: Still exists under this name today. Formally joined Wu commandery in 188. Abolished in 234 * Lou County: Today's Kunshan. Abolished before the year of 589. Parts of this county formed Kunshan and Xingyi county. * Yanguan County: Today's Haining. Originally named Haichang. Established in 223. * Huating County: Today's Shanghai. Established in 751 by the governor of Wu commandery Zhao Juzhen.  Functionaries  According to the bureaucratic system of Han dynasty, every commandery has an identical hierarchy of functionaries. The top administrator of Wu commandery is Taishou(the top official of a Commandery). In addition, the Taishou has a subordinate Juncheng(vice Taishou and an assistant of its work). Military affairs are entrusted to the Duwei of a commandery. In terms of counties, Ling(an officer) is in charge of a county with more than 10 thousand registered families. Zhang(an officer) is in charge of a county with a population that is less than 10 thousand. In Wu commandery, many counties reached a relatively large population thus were governed by a Ling. Numerous resources proved Wu, Wucheng , Yuhang, Qu'e, Haiyan, Fuchun, Jiaxing, Yangxian to be some of the large counties with a Ling. During Jin and Southern dynasties, the top official of commanderies (including Wu commandery) were called Neishi. The Neishi, in practice, did not differ from Taishou in any manner.  Society  Wu was the home of the four clans of Wu. In Eastern Wu , the four clans were pillars of Emperor Sun Quan's rule. Wu and Huaisi region's lords together formed two main power blocs of Eastern Wu. Lu Yun, a nobleman of Wu commandery in Jin dynasty, described his native commandery as a culturally and politically advanced region comparable with Zhongyuan. His assertion was validated by the fact that in the records of the three kingdoms, 28 individuals from Wu commandery were biographized making Wu the most prolific source of historically important figures during the three kingdom period. In Han dynasty, Wu had become known for its economic wealth. The 3rd century intellectual Zuo Si had written a rhymed prose concerning Wu commandery. Through his prose, researchers had discovered Wu's prosperous agriculture. On the other hand, Chen Shou's records indicated a flourishing commercial society in 3rd century Wu commandery. During the rule of Eastern Wu, the government planned military-led plantations in Wu commandery. The aim was to provide a logistic base for the armies on the mission of border defense (against Cao Wei). The Disaster of Yongjia forced numerous northern nobles to flee from their homeland.

Girouard's name has been attached to two surviving pastels, including one which was seized from its owners by the Nazis in Paris in 1941, but otherwise much of her biography remains obscure. She showed work at the salon de la Jeunesse in 1759, 1760, and 1761; the portraits which she displayed, in an unrecorded medium, attracted a great deal of commentary from a variety of reviewers, including a set of verses by an anonymous gentleman who claimed the honor of dining with her one evening. Madame de Beaumer, writing in 1761, stated that she was active in both oils and pastels, and spoke favorably of her output. Nothing further is recorded of Girouard, but it has been posited that she is identical to the Catherine-Marguerite Girouard of paroisse Saint- Roch who died in Paris in 1809.Profile at the Dictionary of Pastellists Before 1800.

The church was consecrated on the 31 March 1934 and replaced a nineteenth century corrugated iron mission church, known locally as the \\"tin tabernacle\\", which was located nearby. It is grade II listed with Historic England who describe it as notable for its largely unaltered 1930s decorative scheme which uses fittings mostly designed by the architect that remain a \\"remarkably complete suite\\".

It awards the National Diploma in Technology.Institute of Technology at Moratuwa University to be re-located History The Ceylon College of Technology (CCT) was thus established at Katubedda in 1966 which offered a practically oriented engineering diploma (Diploma in Technology, abbreviated to DipTech) equivalent to a degree which was developed and offered with the technical assistance of UNESCO. The CCT commenced with specializations in Civil Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering, initially utilizing the physical facilities available at the IPT. The IPT continued in the same premises with its full-time courses, but was amalgamated with the CCT in 1967 and the JTO course was restructured and named as the Technician's course. Arising of a perceived need to separate technical education at lower than degree level from the main university, the Institute of Technology University of Moratuwa (ITUM) was established with effect from 10 March 2000 to conduct the National Diploma in Technology course separately from the Faculty of Engineering, with the Ordinance for the same having been gazetted in August 2000. The present ITUM has been relocated to its new building compound at Homagama, Diyagama with the state of the art laboratories and other facilities for the students of this institute under the University of Moratuwa. Organisation and administration ITUM is administrated by the Board of Management headed by director. The \\"Competent Authority\\" work instead of the director of ITUM.

The first-year subjects are designed mainly to equalize, consolidate and improve the students' knowledge in basic sciences and to introduce the specialized discipline of study to which he/she has been selected. It will also give exposure to some basic skills required in engineering practice (e.g. workshop Technology Engineering Drawing). Each discipline offers one or more field subject/s of the students chosen field of study. (e.g.) Civil Engineering Department offers Building Construction for the Civil Engineering stream) The second-year subjects mainly include the application of various engineering phenomena in the selected field of study. The third-year has been allocated for obtaining the required hands-on experience in the industry.

Victory in the battle was declared by the Prime Minister al-Abadi following the capture of the last ISIL-held area in Tal Afar district. The offensive was concurrent with the Raqqa campaign conducted by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) against ISIL's capital city and stronghold in Syria, as well as the Central Syria Campaign, by the Syrian Army to capture ISIL territory towards Deir ez-Zor.  Background  After the United States-led invasion of Iraq, Tal Afar experienced cycles of sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shi'ites and has produced some of ISIL's most senior leaders. The city was captured by the militants during the early period of their June 2014 offensive. It was strategically significant due to its location along a supply route between Mosul and Syria. Iraqi forces in August attacked Tal Afar, one of the last Iraqi areas under control of ISIL. The operation was launched a month after Mosul was retaken from the group. The city has remained cut off from other territories of the group since June 2017. Warplanes had bombarded the group's positions in the city for several days in preparation for ground operations.  The battle  = Advance to Tal Afar = On 20 August 2017, Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the beginning of the Tal Afar offensive, telling the militants \\"You either surrender, or die\\" in a televised speech. Hours beforehand, leaflets were dropped on the city telling the residents to prepare for battle. Later, the PMU advanced three kilometers and retook four hills, progressing toward Tal Afar from the south. Iraqi airstrikes also destroyed four booby-trapped vehicles driven by suicide bombers. The US-led coalition carried out dozens of airstrikes on the outskirts of the city. On 21 August, Lt. Gen. Abdul Amir Yarallah said the Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) seized five villages southwest of Tal Afar and cut off a road leading to the city. The Federal Police and PMU that were deployed in Tal al-Housan village advanced 19 kilometers west of Tal Afar, destroying an ammunition and weapons stash. Additionally, Iraqi forces regained control of ISIL‚Äôs 250 kilometer long tunnel network, killing 20 ISIL militants in the process. PMU shelling destroyed a telecommunications center and a soldiers department. In order to reduce the effectiveness of Iraqi airstrikes, ISIL set fire to several oil wells in Tal Afar. Some sources reported that as many as 400,000 Iraqi soldiers had been mobilized to the region in support of offensive operations in Tal Afar. = Iraqi forces enter Tal Afar = On 22 August, Abu Qatada al- Afri, an ISIL recruitment officer, was killed in central Tal Afar, along with four other members, in an airstrike. Iraqi army troops and the PMU entered central Tal Afar from the east. The PMU recaptured the Tarmi neighborhood with Iraqi Federal Police, located northwest of the town, and two districts in the northwest and southeast of the city. In addition, the PMU killed a total of 25 militants and exploded 12 devices in the southwest region of Tal Afar. The 16th Infantry Division captured two villages, an intersection, and an oil refinery from ISIL. By the end of the day, Iraqi Army captured the districts of Al-Kifah, Al-Nur and al-Askari after entering the city from southeast and northwest. An operational map published by the Iraqi military showed about three-quarters of the city remaining under militant control. The al-Jazirah area, located east of Tal Afar, was also captured by Iraqi forces. It was estimated that up to 1,000 ISIL fighters still remained in the city. On 23 August, Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF) retook the southwestern edge of Tal Afar, while the Iraqi Police (IP) and paramilitary troops have taken over the northwestern edge. Iraqi forces retook five villages and three neighborhoods in the east, south, and west of the city. In doing so, they took control over several strategic buildings. The Counter-Terrorism Service (CTS) played a part in the liberation of one of the neighborhoods, al-Mo'allameen. Lt. Gen. Yarallah said that the CTS \\"defused 752 improvised explosive devices and cleared seven booby-trapped houses\\" that day. Iraqi forces had also liberated Jolaq junction in Tal Afar. The Ninevah Council announced that more that 50 percent of Tal Afar had already been recaptured by the Iraqi government and that 31 neighborhoods were captured, and 302 ISIL militants had been killed so far. = Reaching the city center = By 25 August, Iraqi forces in the Tal Afar area captured over 30 neighborhoods and killed more than 300 ISIL militants, while also breaching the ISIL defense lines in the center of Tal Afar. A statement from the Iraqi Joint Operations Command (JOC) claimed that elite Iraqi units seized the northern neighborhoods of Nida', Taliaa, Uruba, Nasr, and Saad. A JOC map showed that approximately three quarters of Tal Afar were under Iraqi government control, but militants still controlled the city's northeast quarter. Tal Afar center was captured by Iraqi forces, leaving 90 percent of the town under Iraqi government control. CTS cleared the old citadel and its surrounding neighborhood of Basatin of militants. Clashes still remain in the northern parts of the city. It was later reported that only five percent of the city remains under ISIL control as well. The CTS and Iraqi Police (IP) had also captured three districts and the Al-Rabia neighborhood, located west of the citadel. Iraqi forces had also taken over 14 villages, the Shaikh Ibrahim mountain, and the Zambar mountain range, liberating the southernmost part of the Tal Afar pocket held by ISIL before the offensive began. = Al-Ayadiya = Iraqi forces retook the entirety of Tal Afar by 27 August. Some speculate that the rapid downfall of the city was due to the siege, lack of civilians, which allowed Iraqi troops to use heavy artillery, and an overestimation of the fighters that remained in the city. Iraqi troops then headed towards the town of Al-Ayadia, in order to recapture the rest of the Tal Afar pocket. Iraqi forces were reportedly slowed by snipers, booby-traps, and roadside bombs during their advance to Al-Ayadia. Lt. Col. Salah Kareem of the Iraqi Army stated that the most diehard ISIL militants had fled to the town from Tal Afar. Troops announced that complete victory in the battle would be declared when al-Ayadiya is captured. Iraqi Federal Police service chief, Lt. Gen. Shaker Jawdat announced on 28 August that 50 percent of al-Ayadiya has been captured by Iraqi forces Lt. Gen. Yarallah announced on 30 August that tens of villages in the mountain areas in west and north of Aiyadhiya region, including the strategic Qulabash village, were captured from ISIL by Iraqi forces and that 29 ISIL militants had been killed. Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi announced the capture of al-Ayadia district and declared victory in Tal Afar on 31 August. Iraqi military maps airdropped by the Iraqi air force a few hours after the victory declaration also show that the Nineveh province has now been cleared of ISIL as well. Despite al-Abadi's declaration, fighting continued in al-Ayadiya. Pockets of resistance remained, with Iraqi forces still trying to clear out the remaining militants. Two military officers whose units were leading the battle said scattered militants were still hiding in houses and using tunnels. Four soldiers were killed while 10 were wounded in clashes. The Iraqi Army took full control of the area by 2 September. Yarallah announced later on 2 September, that Iraqi forces killed over 2,000 militants and more than 50 suicide bombers, while destroying and detonating 77 car bombs, 71 booby- trapped buildings and 990 roadside bombs. He also said that 115 Iraqi soldiers were killed while 679 were wounded in the battle. Mahalabiyah and Ayadhiyah, which are a part of the 3,206 square kilometre Tal Afar area, were freed from ISIL militants during the offensive.  Execution of captives  According to Human Rights Watch, Peshmerga forces executed up to 400 ISIL members early in September 2017, who were captured or surrendered north of Tal Afar during the battle for the city.  Aftermath  On 20 September 2017, about three weeks after the end of the Tal Afar offensive, the Iraqi Army launched an offensive on the Hawija Pocket, in order to recapture that region from ISIL.

Singh was a leader of the student movement in Bihar, and played a role in building the Naxalite movement in the state. He was imprisoned for eight years. After his release he was elected twice to the Bihar Legislative Assembly. Childhood Singh was born on 21 December 1938 in Sighwara village, Darbhanga district. He grow up in a peasant household. He was the youngest of four children of Bilat Singh and Swayamvari Devi.CPI(ML) New Democracy. Red Salute to CPI(ML) New Democracy Leader Com. Umadhar Singh! His elder brother Shri Ganga Prasad Singh was a socialist leader. Umadhar Singh aided the socialist movement as a young child, carrying food and letters for underground socialist leaders during the Quit India movement. Singh studied middle education in his home village, later to obtain matriculation at the district school. Student movement Singh obtained a BA (Honours) in Economics at CM College in Darbhanga, later obtaining a MA degree in the same subject at Bihar University in Muzaffarpur. As a student he joined the communist student movement. Singh served as president of the student wing of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in Bihar, the Students Federation, during 1965‚Äì1966. He led student protests against K.B. Sahay, the incumbent Chief Minister of the state. During the course of the agitations Singh was charged with arson at Sahay's residence. Naxalbari revolt and Mushari struggle In the wake of the Naxalbari revolt Singh was called to Delhi by the party leadership to attend a meeting of student organisers, where M. Basavapunniah tried to convince them to reject the revolt. In Delhi Singh argued against the line of the party leadership and resigned from the party. He joined the Bihar affiliate of the All India Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries, the Bihar Coordination Committee of Communist Revolutionaries. During this phase Singh befriended Satyanarayan Singh. Seeking to replicate the Naxalbari uprising in Bihar, Singh became a key leader of the Mushari struggle and led the first armed squad in the area. Singh's area of influence included Hayaghat and Darbhanga. On 2 October 1969 a prominent landlord in Darbhaga, B.P. Balani, was killed in broad daylight. B.P. Balani was a socialist, known for his anti-Naxalite stand. On 30 November, Singh was arrested at the Vidyapati Railway Station in Samastipur district. He was charged with the murder of Balani, a charge he accepted in court. Singh was sentenced to life imprisonment, and was kept in solitary confinement, with his legs in chains. Release from jail After the end of the Emergency Satyanarayan Singh launched a campaign to secure the release of revolutionary prisoners. Singh refused to comply with the demand by the government to give an undertaking for the withdrawal of the case against him, and thus his release was delayed. On 21 December 1977 he was released unconditionally by the Janata Party government. After his release he maintained that the killing of Balani had been justified and coherent with the party directives at the time. Singh became a member of the Bihar State Committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) led by Satyanarayan Singh. He led the Ratnopatti peasant struggle of 1978, during which revolutionaries seized 25 bigha of lands from Hari Mahato (a local landlord). The seized lands were distributed to landless peasants. Trade unionism Singh also engaged in trade union activities and founded the APM Kamgar Union at the Ashok Paper Mill.

Singh finished in third place behind the Janata Party and Congress (I) candidates, obtaining 18,686 votes (3.69%). Split from CPI(ML), setting up of COC, CPI(ML) During the crisis in CPI(ML) 1979‚Äì1980, Singh voiced opposition towards the strategy and theoretical line of the party; he affirmed that the principal contradiction in Indian context stood between feudalism and the broad masses of the people (as opposed to seeing imperialist hegemony as the principal enemy). Subsequently Singh split away from Satyanarayan Singh's party led a party of his own for a few years, called the Central Organising Committee, Communist Party of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (not to be confused with the COC, CPI(ML) formed in 1974). Singh contested the Samastipur seat in the 1980 Lok Sabha election, finishing in fourth place with 13,151 votes (2.80%).Election Commission of India.

Under Singh's leadership the APM workers blocked attempts to remove the machinery of the plant. He also struggled for economic compensation for the APM workers that had been laid off, eventually bringing the case in front of the Supreme Court of India.

He finished in first place amongst 22 candidates, obtaining 13,539 votes (21.30%).Election Commission of India. State Election, 1985 to the Legislative Assembly of BIHAR Soon after the election, Singh's party merged into the Communist Organisation of India (Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (COI(ML)). Singh became a member of the COI(ML) Central Committee but his tenure in COI(ML) was short-lived, as he clashed with key views of the COI(ML) leadership (regarding electoral politics, viewing China as a socialist state and considering the line of the original Communist Party of India (Marxist-Leninist) as 'terrorist'). Singh lost the Hayaghat seat in the 1990 Bihar Legislative Assembly election. He obtained 27,052 votes (28.47%).

Plants have evolved intricate immunity mechanism to combat against pathogen infection by recognizing Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMP) and endogenous Damage Associated Molecular Patterns (DAMP). PEPR 1 considered as the first known DAMP receptor of Arabidopsis.  Discovery  First isolation of AtPEPR 1 was carried out from the surface of Arabidopsis suspension cultured cells. I -125 labeled Azido-cys-AtPEP 1 photo affinity analog specifically interacted with PEPR 1 when incubated with Arabidopsis cells. Separation of this labeled protein using SDS- PAGE led to the identification of the 170 kDa PEPR 1 protein. Further, characterization helped to identify a gene; At1g73080 which encodes for 1,124 amino acids containing PEPR 1.  Function in plant innate immunity  Plasma membrane localized pattern recognition receptors (PRR) that recognized pathogen associated molecular patterns, provide the first line of defense in plants innate immunity. Recent studies in Arabidopsis have provided important details on plant innate immunity. Plant membrane PRR mainly consist of receptor like kinases and receptor like proteins. They sense PAMPs such as chitin from fungal cell wall, sulfated peptides, flagellin elongation factors etc. In addition to PAMPs, PRRs also recognize DAMP molecules that present in the intracellular space response to damage caused by pathogens, e.g.cell wall fragments, cytoplasmic proteins. AtPEP 1, a 23-amino acids precursor peptide encoded by c-terminal of PROPEP 1 gene, is considered to be a DAMP associated molecule in Arabidopsis. Later, study using alanine scanning analysis showed that AtPEP 1 was derived by deletion of N-terminal of precursor protein, PROPEP 1. AtPEPs are functionally similar to systemin, an 18 residues peptide which plays critical role in defense signal and induced in response to wounding, jasmonate and ethylene. PEPR 1 is a receptor kinase with extra cellular leucine rich repeat motif and functions as a receptor for AtPEPs. In addition, Arabidopsis genome encode a close homologue named PEPR 2. But PEPR 1 and PEPR 2 have different preferences for AtPEPs. AtPEP 1 interaction with PEPR 1 activates the defense genes that regulates jasmonate/ethylene and salicylate defense hormones and induce the expression of PDF1.2 (defensin) gene being component of plant innate immune system. Expression of these defense genes would result in more production of PROPEP 1 gene through feedback mechanism. This amplify the danger signals during pathogen infection and confers resistance against pathogens. Moreover, PEPR 1 specifically interacts with receptor like cytoplasmic kinase, Botrylic- Induced Kianse 1 (BIK 1) to mediate PEP1 induce defense. C-terminus of PEPR 1 kinase domain showed a strong interaction with BIK 1 and phosphorylates BIK 1 on serine 236 and threonine 237 residues. Thus, BIK 1 phosphorylation by PEPRs is important for amplifying ethylene induce signaling, which is known to play an important role in plant innate immune system. Further, ethylene can enhance DAMP triggered immunity. Later, it was found that AtPEPs also help to transmit danger signals to the cell interior by activating the cell membrane Ca2+ channels to elevate innate immune defense. This activity is dependent on AtPEPR 1 and cyclic nucleotide gated channel 2 (CNGC2) . Activation of CNGC2 occurs through cGMP when produced by the AtPEPR 1 guanyl cyclic domain AtPEP 1 binding. Thus, cytosol Ca 2+ elevation cause expression of pathogen PDF1.2 gene and basal defense in plants.  Structure  First crystal structure of the LRR domain of PEPR 1 with AtPEP1 (1 -23 residues) was solved by Jiao Tang in 2015. This help to reveal the molecular mechanism of AtPEP 1 recognition by PEPR 1. PEPR 1 receptors are receptor kinases with extracellular LRR motifs. AtPEP1 interacts with the inner side of the PEPR 1 LRR helical structure. PEPR 1 contains 27 canonical LRRs and AtPEP1 interacts LRR 4 to LRR 18. Many amino acids are highly conserved among these LRRs and AtPEP 1 only interacts with 3rd, 5th, 7th and 8th position of each LRR motif. The C- terminal residues of AtPEP 1 shows strong interaction with PEPR 1 LRR than N-terminal. However, N- terminal segment of AtPEP1 also important in DAMP signals and both N and C terminal of AtPEP 1 act cooperatively in signaling. Moreover, it was found that AtPEP 1 interacting residues in PEPR 1 are also highly conserved in PEPR2 . However, PEPR2 does not contain the residues that interact with N-terminal of AtPEP1. Consequently, PEPR 1 has high affinity to AtPEP1.

Early life and education Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York City, Leventhal attended a yeshiva elementary school and Brooklyn Technical High School. When he was nine years old, his parents divorced, and he and his siblings were split up, with the father taking Leventhal's older brother to live with him. Leventhal recalled that he rarely saw his father after that, and that on one occasion, when Leventhal was a teenager, he took a younger sibling to see their father, who \\"slammed the door in our face\\". In Leventhal's formative years he was greatly influenced by Judaism's emphasis on community service and in particular recalls being \\"outraged and disgusted by the way white people treated Jackie Robinson\\". He resolved to fight injustice, and in pursuit of this, after receiving his undergraduate degree from New York University's Washington Square College in 1964, he received a J.D. from the New York University School of Law in 1967.State of New York, The New York Red Book, p. 593.

He represented plaintiffs in approximately 75 lawsuits filed throughout the state to eliminate segregation and discrimination in public schools, employment, public accommodations, housing and municipal services (e.g., street paving, street lighting and fire protection). After Leventhal moved back to New York in 1974, he continued to work for LDF as a staff attorney, litigating cases brought in Mississippi and other states. His ten- year career at the LDF was highlighted by three landmark cases: *Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education, 396 U.S. 19 (1969),William P. Hustwit, \\"Integration Now, Alexander v Holmes County and the End of Jim Crow Education,\\" (2019), in passim. in which the Supreme Court of the United States brought to an end the era of \\"all deliberate speed\\" and ordered school districts to desegregate \\"at once\\". *Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455 (1973), in which the Supreme Court of the United States held unconstitutional state textbook assistance to private schools that discriminate on the basis of race. *Hawkins v. Town of Shaw, 437 F.2d 1286 (5th Cir. 1971), affirmed on rehearing en banc, 461 F. 2d 1171 (5th Cir. 1972), in which the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld lawsuits challenging racial discrimination in the provision of municipal services. Leventhal also testified before the U.S. Senate's Select Committee on Equal Educational Opportunity in 1970 on the progress of school desegregation in Mississippi.United States Senate, Part 3B, Desegregation Under Law, July 8, 1970, pp. 1495-1534. Later public service career After returning to New York in 1974, Leventhal remarried. Between 1979 and 1984, he served first as the Assistant Attorney General of New York, in charge of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau, and then as the Deputy First Assistant Attorney General of New York and Chief of the Litigation Bureau. Leventhal has argued two cases before the Supreme Court of the United States, Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455 (1973, argued in 1972) and Blum v. Stenson, 465 U.S. 886 (1984, argued in 1983).

Cavazza, later as Elisabeth Pullen; 1849‚Äì1926) was an American author, journalist, and music critic. Accustomed to speaking Italian and English, she received thorough training in singing, piano, and musical theory. When little more than a school-girl in Maine, she was taught journalism by Stanley Pullen, then the youthful owner and chief editor of the \\"Portland Press,\\" for whose columns she wrote unsigned verse, sketches and book reviews, acting also as musical critic. A parody in the manner of Algernon Charles Swinburne's Atalanta, \\"Algernon in London\\" deceived some leading members of the Century Club of New York City, from whom she received a card of admission to that club, sent on the supposition that the drama was the work of a man. A second parody, in which Robert Browning figured was not only forgiven by the poet, but also rewarded by a letter. In 1885, she was married to Nino Cavazza of Modena, Italy, who was then in the last stage of illness, and he died in her mother's house a few weeks after. She at once resumed writing, becoming known to readers of magazines as E. Cavazza, and published a volume of stories of Calabrian peasant life, entitled Don Finimondone. She was editor of the Italian department of the Transatlantic, and on the editorial staff of the Boston Literary World, also contributing to many periodicals. In 1894, she was married to Stanley Pullen. Her writings signed thereafter as Elisabeth Pullen. She was also the author of The Man from Aidone, Rocco and Sidora, and Mr. Whitman, as well as translations from the Italian and the French. Her poetical tragedies, Algernon in London and Algernon the Footstool- Bearer, published in the Portland \\"Transcript\\", attracted wide attention in the United States and England. Early years and education Elisabeth Jones was born in Portland, Maine, 1849. She was the daughter of Charles (1801-1859 and Anna (Davies) Jones. Charles came from a seagoing family who were traders in the Mediterranean Sea. He was a leading man in Portland in his day, and was largely instrumental in the welfare and upbuilding of that city. He served as president of the Gas Company and managing director of the Portland Company, of which concerns he was also the practical founder and organizer. He died when his daughter was very young. Accustomed from childhood to speak both the English and Italian languages, enacting dramas with her dolls, intensely interested in Shakespeare's fairies, the demons of \\"Dante's Inferno\\" and stories of the Greek gods and heroes‚Äîher early years were not like those of a typical child of New England. She received a thorough musical education, which included singing, the pianoforte, harmony and counterpoint. As a young girl, she was much interested in musical matters, and received a fine musical education, but her interest soon turned more strictly to literature. Career Don Finimondone: Calabrian Sketches (1892) She began writing for the Portland papers, and was so successful in this as to be encouraged to more ambitious efforts. She had for several years been a regular reviewer and contributor to the Boston Literary World. Professor William Milligan Sloane, editor of the New Princeton Review, was the first to accept a story by Cavazza for a magazine. This story was called \\"A Calabrian Penelope\\", and those who read it were struck, not only by the literary ability displayed, but by the novelty and freshness of the subject, namely: the life of Calabrian peasants in Italy. Some little time before this story appeared, Cavazza came into some prominence on account of two comic tragedies contributed to the Portland Press and dealing with eccentric episodes in the poet Swinburne's life. A review of Edmund Clarence Stedman's \\"Victorian Poets\\" won from the eminent critic a flattering letter in regard to the young journalist. She had an unwillingness to be known to write, and, so well was the mystery maintained, that one day after the publication of her parody upon Swinburne's \\"Atalanta in Calydon,\\" there arrived at the Press office a letter enclosing a card of invitation to the Century Club, which bore the endorsement of Stedman, Bayard Taylor, Richard Henry Stoddard, and August Rodney Macdonough, who assumed the author of the parody to be a man. This parody was quoted by the London Saturday Review as the best sample of this kind of literature on this side of the Atlantic Ocean. A second pseudo-Greek drama \\"Algernon, the Foot-Stool Bearer,\\" in which Swinburne and Robert Browning were parodied, was rewarded by a charming letter from Mr. Browning. Just before Bayard Taylor sailed for Germany to assume the post of Minister at Berlin, he came to Portland on purpose to see the young girl and speak encouragingly to her concerning her literary future. Later, she was honored by the warm friendship of John Greenleaf Whittier. Prof. Henry Wadsworth Longfellow thanked her in a letter for a long poem published in the Press on occasion of his 75 birthday; and when, in September, 1888, a statue of the poet was unveiled in his native city, Cavazza was invited to write a poem, which was read upon the occasion. Besides her work in fiction and for the Literary World, she wrote considerably on contemporary Italian literature for the Atlantic Monthly, and was also a member of the staff of the New World, Nicholas Paine Oilman's review. Cavazza was an intimate friend of Mr. Whittier and of those of his relatives who resided in Portland, and attributed much of her encouragement to continue as a writer to their friendly words. Some of her short stories were issued as \\"Don Finimondone: Italian Sketches,\\" 1892. She was married in February, 1885, to Nino Cavazza, of Modena, Italy. He was a son of Cavaliere Alessandro Cavazza, professor of sculpture in the Royal Academy of Modena. His death occurred within a year from their marriage; but Mrs. Cavazza's early interest in all that relates to Italian life and manners was undoubtedly increased by her marriage. After the death of her husband, Cavazza found it best to adopt literary writing as a serious profession, which she had studied in her childhood. She wrote verse and prose for Portland journals, and some of the leading magazines and juvenile periodicals. She married Stanley T. Pullen, a journalist and financier of Portland, on September 8, 1894. Cavazza died in 1926.

Often misrepresented as ethnic and/or religious conflicts, they are the result of economic, political and environmental tensions in the country. Thousands of people have died since the conflict began. Sedentary farming rural communities are often target of attacks because of their vulnerability. There are fears that this conflict would spread to other West African countries but this has often been down played by governments in the region. Causes of the conflict = Background = Since the Fourth Nigerian Republic‚Äôs founding in 1999, farmer-herder violence has killed more than 19,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands more. It followed a trend in the increase of farmer-herder conflicts throughout much of the western Sahel, due to an expansion of agriculturist population and cultivated land at the expense of pasturelands; deteriorating environmental conditions, desertification and soil degradation; population growth; breakdown in traditional conflict resolution mechanisms of land and water disputes; and proliferation of small arms and crime in rural areas. Insecurity and violence have led many populations to create self-defence forces and ethnic and tribal militias, which have engaged in further violence. The majority of farmer-herder clashes have occurred between Muslim Fulani herdsmen and Christian farmers, exacerbating ethnoreligious hostilities. =Land conflicts= Conflicts between farmers and herders can be understood as a problem of access to land. The beginning of the 21st century witnessed an expansion of agriculturist population and cultivated land at the expense of pasturelands in the Middle Belt. In an already politically unstable region, it has never always been possible to ascertain a legal title to land for every farmer. As a result, transhumance routes of herders were no longer available especially in a context of global warming. =Climatic crisis= Deteriorating environmental conditions, desertification and soil degradation have led Fulani herdsmen from Northern Nigeria to change their transhumance routes. Access to pastureland and watering points in the Middle Belt became essential for herdsmen travelling from the North of the country. It is often assumed that climate change is the driver of the conflict but recent study suggest that climate change does not automatically causes the conflict but it has changed herders' migration pattern . Regions vulnerable to climate change (Northern Regions) experience less farmer-herder conflict and less intense farmer-herder fighting. It is argued that identity differentials between farming and herding groups need to be considered in the explanation of the mechanism of the climate change-farmer-herder conflict nexus. =Regional conflicts in Jos and Kaduna= The farmer/herder conflicts have been taking place in regions which have been unstable since the 2000s. Urban conflicts in Jos and Kaduna have been particularly violent and, despite violent clashes with the authorities, their causes have never been addressed politically. Conflicts might not have been addressed adequately because traditional authorities have not been fulfilling their role in colonial-era settlements. Solving the crisis The Nigerian government has been unwilling to address the causes of the crisis. Fighting Boko Haram in the North-East and facing rising levels of violence in different regions of the country, the government has nonetheless tried to implement a few measures. Since 2012, there have been projects to create transhumance corridors through the Middle Belt. Mostly supported by Northern lawmakers and opposed by their Southern counterparts, these endeavours have been rarely successful. In 2019, President Muhammadu Buhari tried to create Rural Grazing Area (RUGA) settlements. His decision was met with fierce criticism. List of attacks Nigerian and foreign newspapers are often unable to provide exact numbers of casualties. Despite the high number of attacks, Nigerian and foreign journalists have rarely access to first-hand testimonies and tend to report inaccurate figures. * According to the Global Terrorism Index, these conflicts resulted in over 800 deaths by 2015. * The year 2016 saw further incidents in Agatu, Benue and Nimbo, Enugu State.Muslim Fulani Herdsmen Massacres Reach Southern Nigeria, Morning Star News.

It is made of roasted flour, usually spelt flour or oat flour. This kiln-dried flour is called Musmehl. It is usually cooked like a porridge with water and milk.

However, the flour can also turn black if roasted too long in the drying kiln.

Nowadays, Brenntar and the Musmehl have been included in the Ark of Taste, Germany, as \\"almost forgotten regional-type food\\" by the Slow Food Deutschland Organization.  Preparation  As a former convenience food used on a daily basis, Brenntar is quite simple to prepare. Originally the Musmehl was cooked in water only, spiced with salt.

It puts into practice the attributes of soccer and basketball.

The main goal of the National Sports Camp is to develop the children‚Äôs coordination during its golden age (5 to 13 years). During the first edition in 2015, the idea of creating a game that would characterize the camp and its main concern, developing the youth's everyday skills, arose. The game mixes soccer and basketball. It adopts specific and well-thought through ruling that helps the children develop and enjoy FooBaSKILL. The ways of scoring points have been adapted to give the opportunity to all participants helping the team win, work on the lower body and upper body, but also to unconsciously working on their rebounding skills in basketball and scoring in soccer. According to the Swiss Armed Forces, FooBaSKILLL will become official sport of the Swiss Army beginning from m January 2018.

FooBaSKILL has become an official sport in the Swiss physical education system.Official PE Channel of the Swiss Federal Office of Sport  Basic rules  The specificity of FooBaSKILL lies in the interchange of lower body (soccer) and upper body (basketball) work. Players change discipline at the midline of the playing field. Half of the pitch is equipped with two soccer goals, consisting of two upper parts of a gymnastic box with a cone or the FooBaSKILL goal on top. In the other half is a basketball hoop. The back and side walls are an integral part of the playing field, so players can use them to bounce the ball against. Two teams of four players face each other. During the first half, a team defends the soccer goals and attacks the basketball hoop. Then in the second half, the teams reverse the roles. The basic rules are identical to those of soccer and basketball.
