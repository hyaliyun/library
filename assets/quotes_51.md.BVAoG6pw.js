On July 12, 2002 a police intelligence officer in Karachi reported that Pakistani authorities had arrested Sheikh Ahmed Saleem, referring to him as an alleged financial advisor of Osama bin Laden in Pakistan. He was reportedly caught along with two other al Qaeda militants. The officer further misidentified Saleem as a Sudan national, who had apparently fled Afghanistan for Pakistan after the US-led military campaign began in October 2001. The three militants were arrested together during an overnight raid on a suburban apartment in the commercial port city of Karachi. However, it later was suggested that Pakistani news organizations and the officials may have confused Ahmed Salim, the FBI-wanted Kenyan who had run a trucking business, with a Sudanese man with a similar name, Mamdouh Salim. In fact Mamdouh Salim had already been captured in 1998 in Germany. But then on September 9, 2002, the Lahore-based Daily Times once again reportedMost wanted Al Qaeda suspects arrested from Karachi?, Daily Times (of Pakistan), 9 September 2002 that Ahmed Salim had indeed been arrested earlier that summer, on July 11, 2002, in Methadar, an area very close to the place from where Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was also arrested a month earlier, according to the paper. But KSM was actually captured a year later. On September 11, 2002, journalist Syed Saleem Shahzad of the Asia Times wrote that back in July 2002, Pakistani intelligence agents were led to Salim's cell by satellite telephone intercepts provided by the FBI. These led to the arrest in Karachi of a more junior al-Qaeda figure, a Saudi known only as Riyadh or Riaz. Riyadh in turn led investigators to Salim, who was arrested in Kharadar in the south of the city.

She was named after Shadwell plantation, Albemarle County, Virginia, the birthplace and early home of Thomas Jefferson, author of the Declaration of Independence and third President of the United States. Initially authorized under the Lend- Lease Act and named Tomahawk, then renamed Waterway upon assignment to the United Kingdom, LSD-15 was reassigned back to the United States and named Shadwell. She was laid down on 17 January 1944 by the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Co., at Newport News, Virginia; launched on 24 May 1944; sponsored by Miss Mary Greenman; and commissioned on 24 July 1944, Lieutenant Commander William K. Brooks in command. Service history = World War II = After shakedown, Shadwell sailed from Hampton Roads on 26 August 1944. She transited the Panama Canal on 1 September and headed for San Diego, where she laid over for a docking period. After almost a month at San Diego, she departed on 2 October to join the Pacific Fleet. Upon arrival, Shadwell was employed in the transportation of heavy amphibious equipment between the islands of the southern Pacific. During this time, she visited Tulagi and Guadalcanal in the Solomons, Espiritu Santo on the New Hebrides, Manus in the Admiralty Islands, and Hollandia and Aitape on New Guinea. On 28 December 1944, Shadwell embarked elements of the 1060th Engineer Battalion, United States Army, and sailed from New Guinea with Task Force 78 (TF 78). Though her convoy came under continual submarine, surface, and air attack, so efficient were the screening units that Shadwells guns remained silent throughout the entire voyage to Lingayen Gulf, Luzon, P.I. However, on 9 January 1945 (D-Day for the Luzon invasion), Shadwell's gunners proved their worth by splashing an A6M Zero. Shadwell returned immediately to the staging area at Hollandia, New Guinea, embarked additional troops of the 1060th Army Engineers, then departed for Leyte, P.I. At Leyte, she joined Task Group 78.8 (TG 78.8), which soon made for Lingayen. On the evening of 24 January 1945, the task group was sailing south of Siquijor Island, in the Philippines, when it was attacked by three torpedo bombers. Two were splashed by the convoy's combat air patrol, but the third escaped into the darkness. It soon returned, swooping down from the hills on the island, and pressed home its attack. The convoy's antiaircraft guns brought the enemy down, but not before he was able to release his torpedo. The air-dropped \\"fish\\" struck Shadwell just forward of amidships on the starboard side, tearing a hole in her bottom wide. The landing ship was taking water badly and soon began to sink. The convoy steamed on while two destroyers stood by to evacuate her crew if necessary. Shadwells crew worked frantically to save their sinking ship and, by morning, their efforts were rewarded. Shadwell was steaming under her own power, steering for Leyte by trick wheel. Of the more than 500 men aboard Shadwell at the time, there were no fatalities and only three casualties, all only slightly injured. Temporary repairs were made at Leyte and, when she was deemed seaworthy, Shadwell steamed on to Manus in the Admiralty Islands. There she went into drydock and underwent further temporary repairs before crossing the Pacific for permanent repairs. On 4 May, she reached Bremerton, Washington, and entered the Puget Sound Navy Yard. Just over two months later, she departed the yard to rejoin the fleet, sailing on 11 July. She stopped over at San Francisco on 14‚Äì15 July, fueled and took on ballast, then set course for Hawaii. On 23 July, she anchored in Maalaea Bay, off Maui and, the next day, shifted to Pearl Harbor. On the 28th, Shadwell set sail for the western Pacific, specifically Eniwetok Atoll in the Marshalls. She arrived there on 6 August and departed on the following day, bound for Samar in the Philippines. En route to Samar, she was diverted twice, first to Saipan, then to Guam, where she arrived on 13 August. Shadwell departed that same day to join the 3d Fleet and, on the 17th, two days after the cessation of hostilities, she joined TG 30.8. Ten days later, the landing ship arrived in Sagami Wan, off Tokyo Bay, and, two days thereafter, moored in the bay itself. Shadwell remained moored at Tokyo through May 1946, operating the boat pool there. Returning to the United States in mid-1946, Shadwell underwent preinactivation overhaul and, on 10 July 1947, was placed out of commission, in reserve. She was berthed at Orange, Texas, as a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. = 1950 ‚Äì 1970 = On 20 September 1950, Shadwell was recommissioned at Orange, Texas. She operated for the next five years in the western Atlantic and Caribbean. Ranging as far north as Labrador, Greenland, and Newfoundland, Shadwell participated in several Arctic Circle expeditions and exercises including \\"Bluejay\\" and \\"Convex\\" in 1951 and \\"Pinetree\\" in 1953. The remainder of her time was spent along the eastern seaboard and in the Caribbean. On Friday, 4 February 1955 Customs Inspector George M. Bacon was killed when he tripped and fell aboard USS Shadwell, which was docked in Hampton Roads. The vessel had just returned from a tour of the Caribbean and had requested Customs clearance. Inspector Bacon fell approximately into the interior dock- well, resulting in significant trauma to his head. He was pronounced dead on the ship. In 1956, after one Caribbean operation, Shadwell departed Norfolk for a tour of duty with the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. Thus she began a schedule of deployments, alternating Atlantic-Caribbean duty with cruises in the Mediterranean, which lasted until she was decommissioned in 1971. Ten times, during the intervening 15 years, Shadwell cruised the \\"middle sea\\" and visited its ports of call. In 1959, Shadwell became the first helicopter- carrying dock landing ship (She had her call letters changed from LSD to LPH when she carried helicopters ). In 1961, she underwent a Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM) overhaul. She was in the Atlantic supporting the Cuban quarantine in October 1962. In February 1964, she participated in the amphibious exercise \\"Quick Kick V\\" on the coast of South Carolina. Seven months later, during the passage to her sixth Mediterranean deployment, Shadwell took part in Operation \\"Steel Pike\\" executed off the coast of Spain. In 1967, she won the Marjorie Sterrett Battleship Fund Award for the Atlantic Fleet. In January 1968, she was in the Caribbean engaged in Operation \\"Spring Board.\\" During August 1968, Shadwell departed the Mediterranean after a five- month deployment. She entered Little Creek, Virginia, on the 19th to begin inactivation overhaul. In October 1968, Shadwell transported Marines to Vieques Island in the Caribbean and returned to CONUS. In December 1968, Shadwell transported Marines to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and returned to CONUS.http://www.ussthomaston.com/images/shadwellhistory.pdf On 8 July 1969, she was involved in a collision with during a night-time exercise off Malta. On 9 March 1970, she was placed out of commission, in reserve. On 9 September, Shadwell was transferred to the James River, Virginia, group of the National Defense Reserve Fleet. Shadwell was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 November 1976. = Mobile Bay = Shadwell in Mobile Bay, 2014. On 10 November 1988, Shadwell, decommissioned and now known as ex-USS Shadwell, was transferred to the Fire Research Detachment, Little Sand Island, Mobile Bay, Alabama. She is serving as a test and training platform in the development of fire models and other damage and control systems. Shadwell is on the stricken list and will eventually be disposed of upon the end of her use as a test and training platform. Shadwell was grounded on Little Sand Island in Mobile Bay, Alabama, as a result of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. The ship was removed from the position of grounding in 2006. A U.S. Navy Mobile Diving and Salvage Unit (MDSU) assisted with the project. In 2017, the ex-USS Shadwell was decommissioned as a fire test ship and later scrapped in place. All fire testing was shifted to land based facilities located at the Naval Research Laboratory's Chesapeake Bay Detachment in southern Maryland.

Whitehead (born November 1, 1953) is an early game designer and programmer. While working for Atari, Inc. he wrote two of the nine Atari Video Computer System launch titles: Blackjack and Star Ship. After leaving Atari, he cofounded third party video game developer Activision, then Accolade. He left the video game industry in the mid-1980s. Career Whitehead attended San Jose State University and received a BS in Mathematics.Interview with Bob Whitehead from DigitPress.com Whitehead worked for Atari in the late 1970s developing games for the Atari 2600 (or VCS for video computer system). There, he developed several games, including a VCS implementation of chess, a feat many other programmers considered impossible for the system. He and his co- workers David Crane, Larry Kaplan, and Alan Miller became informally known as the \\"Gang of Four\\", a group of developers who felt inadequately compensated for their work despite being collectively responsible for 60 percent of the company's profits from VCS cartridge sales. Whitehead is sometimes credited as co-author, together with the rest of the Gang of Four, of the operating system for the Atari 400/800 computers. It has been however clarified both by Al Miller and by Whitehead himself that he was not involved in the OS development, although he took part in developing applications for the computers. Eventually the Gang of Four, disgruntled by the management's decline to provide more recognition and fair compensation to the developers, decided to leave Atari and start their own business. Whitehead together with Miller, Crane and Kaplan co-founded Activision, the first third-party video game developer, in October 1979. There, with others, he created a VCS development system with an integrated debugger and minicomputer-hosted assembler. It was used for most of Activision's VCS titles. He also developed a \\"venetian blinds\\" animation technique: an algorithm that horizontally reused and vertically interlaced sprites several times while rendering each frame, to give the illusion that the system had more than the maximum number of sprites allowed by the hardware. In 1984, he and other founders of Activision became disillusioned with their company. Their stock had dwindled in value and morale was low. They thought that diversification to the home computer market ‚Äî such as with the Commodore 64 ‚Äî was the key to success. He left Activision with Alan Miller (another co-founder of Activision), and they founded Accolade. Soon after, Whitehead left the video game industry for good. Whitehead left in order to \\"give back to God and spend time with 'the fam'\\". After leaving Accolade, Whitehead says he helped with \\"low income families, getting non- profit religious start-ups going, [and] spending time in the garden.\\" Of the current state of the industry, Whitehead said that it is: Games =Atari 2600= * Home Run (Atari) * Football (Atari) * Blackjack (Atari) * Casino (Atari) * Star Ship (Atari) * Video Chess (Atari) * Boxing (Activision) * Stampede (Activision) * Chopper Command (Activision) * Private Eye (Activision) * Skiing (Activision) * Sky Jinks (Activision) =Commodore 64= * 4th & Inches (Accolade) * HardBall!

There are a few city farms closer to the centre of the city and about 30,000 allotments. There are of farmland in the Greater London area. Nearly all of the farmland in the London area is a basis for the growing culture. Farmland in London is predominantly present in five boroughs: Bromley (of which an estimated 35% is farmland), Havering (estimated 44%), Hillingdon (estimated 23%), Enfield (estimate 22%) and Barnet (estimate 17%). The Lea Valley is a significant centre for salad crops.Lea Valley Growers Association https://www.lvga.co.uk/ History Wormwood Scrubs, a part of the common land The dairy at College Farm, Barnet A field of rape, Felthamhill A Havering barley field Many areas which now form part of Greater London were formerly rural and agricultural outskirts and still bear names which indicate this past: Ealing Common, Lincoln's Inn Fields, Shepherd's Bush and Wormwood Scrubs, for example. In 1938, the Greater London area became the first region in Britain to use a green belt policy and introduced the Metropolitan Green Belt in order to combat urban sprawl. A 2005 agricultural census carried out by ADAS showed that 423 holdings were located in the London part of the metropolitan green belt, around 0.25% of the total number in Britain. The total land managed was 13,608 hectares, half of which was rented. Less than 10% of the land farmed was used for cultivation of organic materials, and the total contribution that farming made to the economy, excluding diversification activities, was less than ¬£8 m. However, London's agricultural industry was shown to be much more reliant on activities pertaining to diversification, with just under a third of farm income attributed to it, exceeding the national average. The report stated that whilst farming was not a significant part of London's economy, it did have a vital role to play. The report showed that farming was mainly concentrated in northeast London, but only included figures on arable farming (the surrounding regions of East and South East are where cereal farming is most prevalent). The report commented that livestock farming had decreased in recent years due to a lack of infrastructure (poor access to abattoirs and markets) and problems associated with being located close to the urban fringe (such as dogs). The report concluded that the low levels of stock in relation to permanent pasture suggested equine usage, something often related to diversification activities; the figures produced in the survey showed that 37% of London's diversification activities were equine related. Horticultural activities were mainly confined to the east of London, south of the River Thames. This survey, as well as one carried out by Farmer's Voice in 2004, showed that the majority of farmers (47% and 35%) felt that planning restrictions, which are more widely and stringently enforced in the green belt, were the greatest barrier to diversification. The next highest was a lack of capital, and both polls showed that the Common Agricultural Policy of the EU was perceived to be smallest obstacle towards furthering diversification. The profitability of agriculture in the London green belt was shown to have increased: in 1999, only 4% of London farms reported an increased or maintained profit level, whereas 27% did in 2008. Forty-eight percent said they feared for their business's survival in 1999; 23% felt this way in 2008.  2008 developments  In an effort to boost the efforts of urban farming in the Greater London area, a conference was called on 1 July 2008 entitled \\"Growing Food for London\\". Organized by the London Parks and Green Spaces Forum, and as part of the London Festival of Architecture, solutions were sought to encourage so called \\"fringe farmers\\" (farmers on the fringe of urban areas) by assessing their needs in urban areas. The impetus for the conference was the rising cost of fuel, and the requisite need for food supplies to be provided closer to urban areas to keep food costs low.

In Pennsylvania, public school districts are required to give 150 days notice to the superintendent and business manager regarding renewal of their employment contracts.Pennsylvania General Assembly, Pennsylvania School Code, 2013 Pursuant to Act 141 of 2012 which amended the Pennsylvania School Code, all school districts that have hired superintendents on/after the fall of 2012 are required to develop objective performance standards and post them on the district's website. The Commonwealth Foundation for Public Policy Alternatives Sunshine Review gave the school board and district administration a \\"F\\" for transparency based on a review of \\"What information can people find on their school district's website\\". It examined the school district's website for information regarding; taxes, the current budget, meetings, school board members names and terms, contracts, audits, public records information and more. Academic achievement In October 2015, Pennsylvania Auditor General Eugene DePasquale reported that 9 schools in the district are among the 561 academically challenged schools that have been overlooked by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. The following Scranton schools were listed: Frances Willard #32; George Bancroft #34; John Adams #4; John F. Kennedy #7; John G Whittier #2; McNichols Plaza, Neil Armstrong #40; Robert Morris #27 and William Prescott #38. He also reported the Pennsylvania Department of Education failed to take any action to remediate the poorly performing schools to raise student academic achievement or to provide them with targeted professional assistance. ;Opportunity scholarships: In April 2014, the Pennsylvania Department of Education released a report identifying 7 Scranton School District schools as among the lowest achieving schools for reading and mathematics in the state.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program 2014-15, April, 2014 GEORGE BANCROFT #34; JOHN ADAMS #4; JOHN F KENNEDY #7; JOHN G WHITTIER #2; MCNICHOLS PLAZA; SCRANTON High School and SOUTH SCRANTON Intermediate School were all identified as lowest achieving in the state. In 2011-12, two Scranton school were on the list: GEORGE BANCROFT #34 and JOHN F. KENNEDY #7. In 2012, Scranton High School, South Scranton Intermediate School, Mcnichols Plaza, John F. Kennedy #7, John Adams #4, and George Bancroft #34 were all among the 15% lowest achieving schools in the Commonwealth. Parents and students may be eligible for scholarships to transfer to another public or nonpublic school through the state's Opportunity Scholarship Tax Credit Program passed in June 2012. The scholarships are limited to those students whose family's income is less than $60,000 annually, with another $12,000 allowed per dependent. Maximum scholarship award is $8,500, with special education students receiving up to $15,000 for a year's tuition. Parents pay any difference between the scholarship amount and the receiving school's tuition rate. Students may seek admission to neighboring public school districts. Each year the PDE publishes the tuition rate for each individual public school district. Fifty-three public schools in Allegheny County are among the lowest-achieving schools in 2011. According to the report, parents in 414 public schools (74 school districts) were offered access to these scholarships. Funding for the scholarships comes from donations by businesses which receive a state business tax credit for donating. ;Statewide ranking In 2015, Scranton School District was ranked 456th out of 493 Pennsylvania public school districts, by the Pittsburgh Business Times. The ranking is based on the last 3 years of student academic achievement as demonstrated by PSSAs results in: reading, writing, math and science and the three Keystone Exams (literature, Algebra 1, Biology I) in high school. Three school districts were excluded, because they do not operate high schools: (Saint Clair Area School District, Midland Borough School District, Duquesne City School District). The PSSAs are given to all children in grades 3rd through 8th. Adapted PSSA examinations are given to children in the special education programs. Writing exams were given to children in 5th and 8th grades. *2014 - 446th *2013 - 418th *2012 - 361st *2011 - 306th *2010 - 281st *2009 - 273rd *2008 - 233rd *2007 - 212th out of 501 Pennsylvania school districts. In 2009, the academic achievement, of the students in the Scranton School District, was in the bottom 33rd percentile among all 500 Pennsylvania school districts Scale (0-99; 100 is state best). In 2008, a study was done of public schools in Lackawanna County and Luzerne County. It found that of the 10 public school districts in Lackawanna County, Scranton School District academic achievement ranked 7th in math and 9th in Reading. =District AYP status history= In 2012, Scranton School District declined further to District Improvement Level I Adequate YEarly Progress (AYP) status due to chronic, low student academic achievement. *2011 - declined to Warning status due to low student achievement in several schools. *2010 - achieved AYP status.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Scranton School District AYP Overview 2010, October 20, 2010 *2009 - achieved AYP status through safe harbor provisionsPennsylvania Department of Education, Scranton School District AYP Overview 2009, September 14, 2009 *2008 - declined to Warning AYP status. *2006 and 2007 - achieved AYP status.PDE, Scranton School District AYP Report 2007, 2007 *2005 - remained in School Improvement Level 1 AYP status.PDE, Scranton School District AYP Report 2005, 2005 *2004 - School Improvement Level 1 AYP status.PDE, Scranton School District AYP Report 2004, 2004 *2003 - Warning AYP status due to lagging student achievement in reading and math =Graduation rate= In 2012, Scranton School District graduation rate was 89.27%. *2011 - 82%.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Scranton School District AYP table 2011, September 29, 2011 *2010 - 82%, the Pennsylvania Department of Education issued a new, 4-year cohort graduation rate. According to traditional graduation rate calculations: * 2010 - 90% * 2009 - 93% * 2008 - 90% * 2007 - 90% ;College remediation: In January 2009, the Pennsylvania Department of Education released a study on college preparation that found 22% of Scranton School District graduates required remediation in mathematics and or reading before they were prepared to take college level courses in the Pennsylvania State System of Higher Education or community colleges. Less than 66% of Pennsylvania high school graduates, who enroll in a four-year college in Pennsylvania, will earn a bachelor's degree within six years. Among Pennsylvania high school graduates pursuing an associate degree, only one in three graduate in three years.National Center for Education Statistics, IPEDS Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System, 2008 Per the Pennsylvania Department of Education, one in three recent high school graduates who attend Pennsylvania's public universities and community colleges takes at least one remedial course in math, reading or English. Graduation requirements The Scranton School Board has determined that students must earn 24 credits to graduate, including: English 4 credits, Math 4 credits, Social Studies 4 credits, Arts Humanities 2 credits, Physical Education 1 credit, Health 0.8 credits, Safety 0.2 credits and 4 electives. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. At Scranton School District the graduation project consists of a research paper that must be completed by the end of the first semester of the student's junior year. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania State School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2019, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the respective Keystone Exams for each course. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. Dual enrollment The Scranton School district high schools offer the Pennsylvania dual enrollment program. This state program permits high school students to take courses, at local higher education institutions, to earn college credits. The students continue to have full access to activities and programs at their high school. The college credits are offered at a deeply discounted rate. The state offers a small grant to assist students in costs for tuition, fees and books. Under the Pennsylvania Transfer and Articulation Agreement, many Pennsylvania colleges and universities accept these credits for students who transfer to their institutions. The Pennsylvania College Credit Transfer System reported in 2009, that students saved nearly $35.4 million by having their transferred credits count towards a degree under the new system. In 2010, the district received a $177,704 state grant to be used to assist students with tuition, fees and books. Special education In December 2013, Scranton School District administration reported that 1,763 pupils, or 18.9% of the district's pupils, received special education services, with 44% of the identified students having a specific learning disability. In December 2009, Scranton School District administration reported that 1,776 pupils, or 18.5% of the district's pupils, received special education services. In 2007, Pennsylvania Secretary of Education Gerald Zahorchak testified before the Pennsylvania House Education Committee regarding full-day kindergarten. He claimed that districts which offered the program would see a significant decrease in special education students due to early identification and early intervention. He asserted the high cost of full-day kindergarten would be recouped by districts in lower special education costs. Scranton School District has provided full-day kindergarten since 2008. The district has seen no decrease in the percentage of special education students it serves, yielding no savings. The district engages in identification procedures to ensure that eligible students receive an appropriate educational program consisting of special education and related services, individualized to meet student needs. At no cost to the parents, these services are provided in compliance with state and federal law; and are reasonably calculated to yield meaningful educational benefit and student progress. To identify students who may be eligible for special education, various screening activities are conducted on an ongoing basis. These screening activities include: review of group-based data (cumulative records, enrollment records, health records, report cards, ability and achievement test scores); hearing, vision, motor, and speech/language screening; and review by the Instructional Support Team or Student Assistance Team. When screening results suggest that the student may be eligible, the district seeks parental consent to conduct a multidisciplinary evaluation. Parents who suspect their child is eligible may verbally request a multidisciplinary evaluation from a professional employee of the district or contact the Special Education Department. The IDEA 2004 requires each school entity to publish a notice to parents, in newspapers or other media, including the student handbook and website regarding the availability of screening and intervention services and how to access them. Students who have an Individual Education Plan (IEP) may take the PSSA-M an alternative math exam rather than the PSSA.Eleanor Chute., Modified PSSA test in math offered for 1st time, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, April 18, 2010 Some special education students may take the PASA (Pennsylvania Alternate System of Assessment), rather than the PSSA. Schools are permitted to provide accommodations to some students. In 2010, the state of Pennsylvania provided $1,026,815,000 for special education services. The funds were distributed to districts based on a state policy which estimates that 16% of the district's pupils are receiving special education services. This funding is in addition to the state's basic education per pupil funding, as well as, all other state and federal funding. The Pennsylvania Special Education funding system assumes that 16% of the district's students receive special education services. It also assumes that each student's needs accrue the same level of costs. The state requires each district to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students. Overidentification of students, in order to increase state funding, has been an issue in the Commonwealth. Some districts have more than 20% of its students receiving special education services while others have 10% supported through special education. The state requires each public school district and charter school to have a three-year special education plan to meet the unique needs of its special education students.Amy Morton, Executive Deputy Secretary, Public Hearing: Special Education Funding & Accountability Testimony, Pennsylvania Department of Education, November 11, 2011 In 2012, the Obama Administration's US Department of Education issued a directive requiring schools include students with disabilities in extracurricular activities, including sports. Scranton School District received a $5,223,073 supplement for special education services in 2010. For the 2011‚Äì12, 2012‚Äì13 and 2013-14 school years, all Pennsylvania public school districts received the same level of funding for special education that they received in 2010-11. This level funding is provided regardless of changes in the number of pupils who need special education services and regardless of the level of services the respective students required.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education Funding 2011-2012 Fiscal Year, 2011 For the 2014-2015 school year, ASD received an increase to $1,609,632 from the Commonwealth for special education funding.Pennsylvania Department of Education, Special Education funding report by LEA, July 2014 Additionally, the state provides supplemental funding for extraordinarily impacted students. The district must apply for this added funding. In 2013, the state's Special Education Funding Reform Commission provided a report on the state of funding for special education in the Commonwealth. Funding for special education programs is borne largely on a local basis at 60%, with the state contributing $1 billion or 30% and the federal government providing 10% of the funding. =Gifted education= The District Administration reported that 167 students or 1.75% of its students were gifted in 2009. By law, the district must provide mentally gifted programs at all grade levels. The primary emphasis is on enrichment and acceleration of the regular education curriculum through a push in model with the gifted instructor in the classroom with the regular instructor. This approach permits such specialized instructional strategies as tiered assignments, curriculum compacting, flexible grouping, learning stations, independent projects and independent contracts. Students identified as gifted attending the High School have access to honors and advanced placement courses, and dual enrollment with local colleges. The referral process for a gifted evaluation can be initiated by teachers or parents by contacting the student's building principal and requesting an evaluation. All requests must be made in writing. To be eligible for mentally gifted programs in Pennsylvania, a student must have a cognitive ability of at least 130 as measured on a standardized ability test by a certified school psychologist. Other factors that indicate giftedness will also be considered for eligibility. Bullying Policy The Scranton School Administration reported one incident of bullying occurring in the schools in 2009. The school board prohibits bullying by district students and employees. The board directs that complaints of bullying shall be investigated promptly, and corrective action shall be taken when allegations are verified. No reprisals or retaliation shall occur as a result of good faith reports of bullying. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. District administration are required to annually provide the following information with the district's Safe School Report: the board's bullying policy, a report of bullying incidents in the school district, and information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or education programs. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and antiharassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education. Budget In 2009, the district reports employing over 700 teachers with a starting salary of $34,000 for 185 days for pupil instruction.

Additionally, Scranton School District teachers receive a defined benefit pension, health insurance, dental insurance, life insurance, professional development reimbursement, several paid personal days, 10 paid sick days, 5 paid bereavement days, and other benefits. Teachers are paid an additional hourly rate, if they are required to work outside of the regular school day. The school day is 6 and 1/4 hours in elementary schools and 6 and 3/4 hours in the middle schools/high schools. A retirement bonus of $10,000 a year for 7 years is paid to encourage teachers with more than 20 years service to retire. Retirees also receive $100 for each unused sick day over their career. According to State Rep. Glen Grell, a trustee of the Pennsylvania Public School Employees‚Äô Retirement System Board, a 40-year educator can retire with a pension equal to 100 percent of their final salary. In 2007, the district employed 675 teachers. The average teacher salary in the district was $52,030 for 185 school days worked. In November 2011, both the union and school board rejected the state Labor Relations Board fact-finding report, which outlined contract recommendations. Items in the report included salary issues, and called for teachers to receive a 1.25 percent raise, plus step movement based on years of service and advanced degrees, in 2011-12 and 2012‚Äì13, and a 1.5 percent increase plus step in 2013-14.

The district is funded by a combination of: a local earned income tax or 3.4%, a property tax, a real estate transfer tax 0.5%, coupled with substantial funding from the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania and the federal government. Grants can provide an opportunity to supplement school funding without raising local taxes. In the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, pension and Social Security income are exempted from state personal income tax and local earned income tax regardless of the individual's wealth. =State basic education funding= According to a report from Representative Todd Stephens office, Scranton School District receives 48.8% of its annual revenue from the state.

After the review of the information, the district was not required to implement any of the recommended cost savings changes. =Real estate taxes= The Scranton School Board set property tax rates in 2011-2012 at 109.0000 mills. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value. Property taxes, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, apply only to real estate - land and buildings. The property tax is not levied on cars, business inventory, or other personal property. Certain types of property are exempt from property taxes, including: places of worship, places of burial, private social clubs, charitable and educational institutions and government property. Additionally, service- related, disabled US military veterans may seek an exemption from paying property taxes. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections, which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. Irregular property reassessments have become a serious issue in the commonwealth as it creates a significant disparity in property taxation within a community and across a region. Pennsylvania school district revenues are dominated by two main sources: 1) Property tax collections, which account for the vast majority (between 75-85%) of local revenues; and 2) Act 511 tax collections (Local Tax Enabling Act), which are around 15% of revenues for school districts. *2010-11 - 109.0000 mills. 2009-10 - 109.2400 mills. In 2010, the high number of tax exempt properties became an issue. A Times-Tribune analysis found that 1,204 of Scranton's 27,037 properties were tax exempt and therefore paid no school property taxes. Act 1 Adjusted index The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not authorized to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten the exceptions to the Act 1 Index. The following exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate. The School District Adjusted Index for the Scranton School District 2006-2007 through 2010-2011. * 2006-07 - 5.6%, Base 3.9% * 2007-08 - 4.9%, Base 3.4% * 2008-09 - 6.4%, Base 4.4% * 2009-10 - 6.0%, Base 4.1% * 2010-11 - 4.3%, Base 2.9% * 2011-12 - 2.1%, Base 1.4% * 2012-13 - 2.5%, Base 1.7% Scranton School Board did not apply for exceptions to exceed the Act 1 index for the budgets in 2009-10 or in 2010-11. In the Spring of 2010, 135 Pennsylvania school boards asked to exceed their adjusted index. Approval was granted to 133 of them and 128 sought an exception for pension costs increases. Property tax relief In 2009, the Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief from gambling for the Scranton School District was $334 per approved permanent primary residence. In the district, 13,037 property owners applied for the tax relief. The tax relief was subtracted from the total annual school property on the individual's tax bill. Property owners apply for the relief through the county Treasurer's office. Farmers can qualify for a farmstead exemption on building used for agricultural purposes. The farm must be at least 10 contiguous acres and must be the primary residence of the owner. Farmers can qualify for both the homestead exemption and the farmstead exemption. In Lackawanna County, the highest property tax relief in 2009 was awarded to the approved property owners in Scranton School District. Pennsylvania awarded the highest property tax relief to residents of the Chester-Upland School District in Delaware County at $632 per homestead and farmstead in 2010. This was the second year Chester Upland School District was the top recipient. According to Act 1 of 2006, Scranton School District could use gambling revenues for wage tax relief rather than property tax relief. Additionally, the Pennsylvania Property Tax/Rent Rebate program is provided for low income Pennsylvanians aged 65 and older; widows and widowers aged 50 and older; and people with disabilities age 18 and older. The income limit is $35,000 for homeowners. The maximum rebate for both homeowners and renters is $650. Applicants can exclude one-half (1/2) of their Social Security income, consequently individuals who have income substantially more than $35,000, may still qualify for a rebate. Individuals must apply annually for the rebate. This can be taken in addition to Homestead/Farmstead Property Tax Relief. Property taxes in Pennsylvania are relatively high on a national scale. According to the Tax Foundation, Pennsylvania ranked 11th in the U.S. in 2008 in terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of home value (1.34%) and 12th in the country in terms of property taxes as a percentage of income (3.55%). Extracurriculars Scranton School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and sports. Eligibility to participate is set by school board policies. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those home schooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs, including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools.

For the IEEE technical society, see Computer-Aided Design Technical Committee. CANDE (Command AND Edit) is a command line shell and text editor on the MCP (Master Control Program) operating system which runs on the Unisys Clearpath series of mainframes. Originally implemented on Burroughs large systems, it has a range of features for interacting with the operating system execution environment, focused on executing, editing and compiling programs, and creating, copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files in general. Its full name is CANDE MCS. MCS, or Message Control Subsystem is the general form of a systems program in the Burroughs architecture (other than MCP, the Master Control Program or core OS). As an MCS, CANDE is more than just an editor as it provides overall control for a network of users. The editing capabilities of CANDE are anachronistic for casual (as opposed to scripted) editing as they predate full screen and graphical editors. CANDE was also used on the Burroughs CMS (mini computer) range, with very similar syntax. In contemporary MCP, CANDE is primarily used thru the ODT (Operator Display Terminal) and MARC (Menu Assisted Resource Control) on emulators of the original character oriented terminals as with other legacy mainframe interfaces such as ISPF. Features CANDE provides a command-line interpreter and line editor, although unlike the modern interpretation of an operating system command line interpreter, the CANDE commands are compiled into the CANDE MCS, as shell like capabilities are provided by WFL. Other notable features and functions include: *Create, edit, and maintain (copy, move, remove, print, rename) data and program files *Compile and execute programs *Access and display information about the data communication network including terminal communication lines and remote devices *Dynamically alter the communication network *Access and display job and task information *Utility functions (calculator, system utility test, etc.) In addition to these features CANDE has an on-line help facility. Implementation For extra speed, CANDE implemented user context switching by swapping a block at the top of the stack. This novel method broke several assumptions built into the design of Burroughs large systems, in particular the handling of virtual memory descriptors, and meant that CANDE itself had to be written in DCALGOL with system-level privileges. Architecturally, CANDE is split into two main sections: a primary, single-instanced main process originally supporting up to 255 simultaneous users, and one or more worker stacks. The main process is called BUMP. It receives all input messages, including input from users. Simple requests which can be executed without delay and do not involve any I/O such as disk access are handled immediately. Other requests are added to a work queue and handled by one of the worker processes. The worker process is called GRIND; there can be one or more instances at any time. Each GRIND process has by default five pseudo-threads which actually carry out the work. The internal threading model for context switching selects one of the worker pseudo-threads per GRIND process and makes it the executing context. This is achieved by copying it to the top of the stack. When the worker process needs to execute I/O or other asynchronous activity, it initiates the action, marks what it is waiting for, and calls the context-switching function, which selects a different context for execution. CANDE operates without internal locks, by careful separation of data. Each possible user connection (or station) is assigned an index into a main array called the station array, or STA (\\"stay\\"). The current station index is named STAX (pronounced \\"stay-x\\"). There are multiple words of state data per station, but they are stored with all of the first words together, followed by all of the second words, etc. This allows CANDE to index into the array using only addition, not multiplication (which made for faster operation on the hard-wired CPUs of the era). CANDE was originally written in 1973 by Darrel F. High. It was taken over by Randall Gellens in 1984, at which point the library maintenance (file copying, moving, renaming, and deleting) routines were rewritten to allow for significantly expanded capabilities, a slew of utilities were added using the \\"?\\" syntax (allowing them to be used even while a program was running), and several architectural improvements were made. It was later transferred to the Santa Barbara plant, and eventually to India. The \\"?\\" syntax, originally allowing for control during program execution (when input would normally be directed to the program), grew to include a number of utilities.

The 145th episode of the series overall, it first aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 26, 2006. In the episode, Al Gore visits South Park to warn everyone about a creature called ManBearPig, an allegory for global warming. Gore then gets Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny trapped inside the Cave of the Winds. The creature is actually a homage from the eco-horror cult film Prophecy directed by John Frankenheimer wherein the film's monster is a result of environmental contamination.  Plot  Al Gore (voiced by Trey Parker) visits South Park Elementary and warns the school's students about ManBearPig, an imaginary monster which roams the Earth attacking humans. Gore describes the monster as ‚Äúhalf man, half bear, half pig.‚Äù While Gore continues to spread awareness of the fictional cryptid, Randy advises Stan and the boys to not be involved with Gore as he is only seeking attention. One night, Gore calls Stan about ManBearPig and Stan tries to turn him down gently; Gore weeps from this rejection until Stan changes his mind. Gore then persuades Stan, Kyle, Cartman, and Kenny to attend a ManBearPig meeting, where Gore states that the creature is hiding in the Cave of the Winds. The boys agree to assist Gore in his hunt for ManBearPig in exchange of being officially dismissed from school that day. In the caves, the echo sound the cave is named for causes Gore to mistaken the sound for the creature. He fires a shotgun wildly, which causes a cave-in that leaves the boys trapped in the caverns; all others escape before the cave-in and Gore believes ManBearPig is at fault. While the boys search for a way out of the cave, Cartman discovers a small cavern filled with what appears to be treasure. Greedily, he starts swallowing the treasure piece-by- piece to smuggle it out of the cave. As a rescue team assembles outside the cave to find the boys, Gore diverts the flow of a nearby stream in order to cause a flood which fills the cavern in an attempt to kill the still-unseen monster. The boys manage to escape just as a memorial service is being held for them. Stan angrily yells at Gore and calls him a \\"loser\\", who is unfazed as he is certain that he killed ManBearPig. Cartman tries to walk away, but he does not get far before he begins painfully defecating pieces of treasure. It is revealed to Cartman that the treasure was a prop used for tourist photo ops and is only worth about $14; this upsets Cartman as he continually defecates the fake treasure and Kyle angrily admonishes him for all the trouble of trying to save him. Gore announces his plans to make a film starring himself and dons a cape before pretending to fly away. Reception Eric Goldman from IGN gave the episode a score of 6.0 out of 10. He thought it was a superior episode compared to \\"A Million Little Fibers\\", the previous episode of the season, but still called it an \\"okay, middle of the road\\" episode.Goldman, Eric (April 27, 2006). \\"South Park: ManBearPig Review\\". IGN. Retrieved October 26, 2016. Home release \\"ManBearPig\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Parks tenth season, was released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on August 21, 2007.

Legacy  ManBearPig is one of the antagonist characters shown in the \\"Imaginationland\\" trilogy in the eleventh season of South Park. The episode is notorious as an allegory for climate change denial because Trey Parker and Matt Stone were initially unconvinced about Gore's film An Inconvenient Truth.

Former member of the long-standing influential Hungarian punk rock outfit C.A.F.B., \\"Gabi Hun\\" moved to Seattle not knowing a word of English, and soon after formed Sledgeback. History =Beginning 2004‚Äì2007= Gaining a large following early in their career, Sledgeback have toured both locally, and internationally, playing in 2005's Vans Warped Tour and even opening for the likes of Flogging Molly to sold-out crowds. With their first album release People's Choice through Sliver Records, Sledgeback gained notoriety through bi coastal radio play and crowd pleasing shows due in large part to high intensity performances, while boasting powerfully raw, life inspired lyrics. The band claims on its official website that, Sledgeback started as an attempt of the Gabor Hun to continue his previous project C.A.F.B. which is undoubtedly the biggest influence of group, dates back to 1990. The previous accomplishments of Hun with C.A.F.B. helped build a loyal fanbase for Sledgeback around Hungary, and gained attention in various European countries following the release of their second album by Rebellion Records (Holland) in 2007. After months of negotiation to alleviate the agreement between the band and Sliver Records, regarding the release of the disputed second album, Perception Becomes Reality to Rebellion records, Sledgeback departed the label. Rebellion signed Sledgeback and placed one of the album's song \\"Wonderland\\" to the We are the Underground compilation in addition to the release of Perception Becomes Reality. The work was published as compact disc (CD) and vinyl (12\\") format. =Intermission 2008= Due to several member changes Sledgeback remained relatively silent throughout 2008 with only a handful of Seattle area performances, supporting bands such as the The Acc√ºsed and the Angry Samoans. =Revival 2009‚Äì2010= In 2009, former Himsa drummer Tim Mullen joined Sledgeback. After Parker Lundgren guitarist left to play for Queensr√øche,the group continued working on their third album, Bite the Bullet, as a trio. It released by Sliver Records in November 2010 following a 12 track split cd (compact disc) Reality Bites with Welsh punk veterans Foreign Legion. One of the most popular songs of the band (\\"Pants Off\\") from their debut album, was used in the soundtrack of the German action-comedy DVD feature OTE by Derik Rentrop in 2010. =2011 and beyond= Sledgeback appeared on a (vinyl) 7\\" compilation titled Shut the F*** Up and Listen Vol. IV with a sixty seconds long track, \\"Oi generation\\". Released by PIG Records, the disc contains artists including GG Allin and MDC. Following another appearance with a song on the Zombie Pit compilation in 2012, the band released a three-way split 3 of a Kind with Los Angeles punk rockers The Generators and C.A.F.B. The album also served as retrospective take on the band's deeper millennial roots through C.A.F.B., which was credited as the fundamental starting point of Sledgeback, upon Hun's official departure following their 2004 album. In May 2012, New Music Distribution and the German SN-Punx record label issued the first ever retrospective compilation of Sledgeback with 16 songs. The album, 7 Years Like a Broken Record covered the band's career between 2004 and 2011, including re-mastered and re-recorded versions of some of their previously released songs. Trotter left Sledgeback in mid 2013. He was replaced by Justin McCawley who is also a member of the Seattle punk group The Insurgence. Sledgeback at Whisky a go go Hollywood Style and sound The sound of Sledgeback originates in the Hungarian front man's vocal style that defines the whole structure of the group with lyrics that often describe painful moments of life taken from Hun's personal experiences. Sledgeback may sound close to its influences but still is easily recognizable, creating a unique mixture of the so-called \\"street punk\\" and \\"oi!\\" styles with the timeless sound of 1990s west coast punk, and successfully incorporating the vocals of Gabor Hun that sets them aside from other similar bands. Possibly because of the frontman's Central European heritage, Sledgeback's musical style is comparable with bands like the German B√∂hse Onkelz, The Freeze as well as Pegboy and Gabor Hun's previous group from Hungary, C.A.F.B.. Roots The roots of Sledgeback can be traced back to Gabor Hun's previous group, C.A.F.B. which was an important part of the 1990s Hungarian punk and alternative music revival. (As it mentioned in the most comprehensive Hungarian music encyclopedia Hun left Hungary and with that his band C.A.F.B. to start a new life in Seattle where he later formed Sledgeback. The musical structure of both bands are the same, with the driving stripped down raw guitar chords. The only difference between the two groups is the keyboard, which was also an essential element of C.A.F.B. in the latter albums, particularly their most successful work, Zanza, which launched the band into the Hungarian mainstream in 1997.

It is endemic to southeastern Australia and is found in eastern Victoria and in southeastern New South Wales. The Jenolan Caves tree frog, a population formerly separated as Litoria jenolanensis, is nowadays included in this species. Description A green morph of Ranoidea citropa This is a moderate sized frog, up to about 60 mm in length. Its dorsal surface is brown with a few darker flecks. There is a dark stripe that runs from the nostril, above the tympanum, to the groin. There is a lighter golden stripe above and adjacent to the dark stripe. The frog is normally green on the side of the head (under the eye), side and arms and legs. The amount of green on an individual frog can range from almost none at all to an all green colour morph (see images, both frogs from the same site). The green colour can occasionally be aqua-green. The armpit, thigh, groin, and inner section of the foot are bright red-orange in colour. The belly is white. Ecology and behaviour Blue Mountains tree frogs in amplexus This species is associated with flowing rocky streams in woodland and wet or dry sclerophyll forest. This species has a two-part call, the first is a strong \\"warrrrrk\\" followed by a number a shorter notes, that sound like a golf ball going in a hole. Males call from streamside vegetation and rocks in the stream from spring to summer, normally after heavy rain. This species is often found in highland areas, especially the Blue Mountains, hence its name. The species Litoria jenolanensis is suspected to be genetically the same as this species.

It lies on the slope of North Mountain in the drainage area of Cedar Creek near Star Tannery west of Strasburg. The forest was established by a grant by John and Bernice Hoffman, who owned the land since 1950. The forest is managed by the Virginia Department of Forestry, with a focus on research relating to the re-establishment of American chestnut trees. Public access is not permitted. History Although much of future state forest was too steep and the soil too thin for agriculture, it nonetheless was part of a growing Virginia economy. The first industry to use the forest was iron furnaces established in the mid-18th century and existing until after the Civil War. Isaac Zane, a Quaker from Pennsylvania, built the first two of these furnaces (Zane's Old Furnace 1768-74 and The Marlboro Works 1772-95) and received grants of forest land which included the future state forest to be used to make charcoal as fuel. In 1868 a tannery was constructed and consumed the forest for the tannin-rich bark on the trees. The tannery eventually moved on, leaving only its name attached to the nearby community of Star Tannery. Afterwards, inhabitants cut firewood and timber for charcoal-fueled kilns that produced quicklime from limestone in the Shenandoah Valley. By the middle of the 20th century very little forest remained on the slopes of North Mountain. John and Bernice Hoffman established the current forest on the land by planting timber stands of loblolly pine and encouraging natural regeneration of native hardwoods. They also worked to re-establish the American chestnut, formerly a dominant tree in the Appalachian forest prior to the outbreak of the chestnut blight in the early 20th century. John hopes his trees will help restore the chestnuts to their former glory and that some of them will resist the blight.

Plot A quartet of women on a road trip experience car trouble, and seek shelter in a seemingly abandoned farmhouse, where they have an orgy. The girls are interrupted mid-coitus by the home's owners, a group of hillbilly cousins who make the travellers have sex with them. Afterward, two of the women are tied to chairs and placed in a boathouse, though one of them manages to free herself, and undo her companion's ropes. While those two have sex, they are spied on by three of the rednecks, who eventually join them. Outside, one of the girls has been tied up and placed in the back of a truck. While her abductor digs a grave, the woman tries to make a run for it, but she is quickly recaptured. The girl is taken back to the house, where she and two of her friends (one of whom is placed in a swing) are used for sex. Next, a female member of the backwoods clan has sex with one of the girls, choking her and suffocating her with a bag during the act. Another orgy occurs, this time involving two men and two women, the latter being urinated on before the sex begins. After one of the hillbillies climaxes, the film abruptly ends, with the women presumably still being held prisoner in the farmhouse.

Marcantonio II Colonna (sometimes spelled Marc'Antonio; 1535 - August 1, 1584), Duke of Tagliacozzo and Duke and Prince of Paliano, was an Roman aristocrat who served as a Viceroy of Sicily in the service of the Spanish Crown, Spanish general, and Captain General of the Church. He is best remembered for his part as the admiral of the Papal fleet in the Battle of Lepanto. Biography Marcantonio Colonna, born in 1535 at Civita Lavinia, was a member of the noble Colonna family of the Lazio, then one of the most powerful feudal dynasties of the Papal States and the Kingdom of Sicily, which was under Spanish rule. His parents were Ascanio Colonna, Duke of Tagliacozzo, and Giovanna d'Aragona. The Colonna coat of arms, from the Palazzo Bellomo in Syracuse. Due to acts of rebellion, he was disinherited by his father; but in 1562 Colonna was able to regain the family fiefs for himself, largely thanks to the support of Pope Pius IV. However, he had to forfeit several possessions, such as Nemi, Ardea, and Civita Lavinia, due his father, Ascanio, having left little money. In 1553‚Äì1554, during the war against Siena, Colonna was made commander of the Spanish cavalry. At the Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), he commanded the papal Capitana (flagship) as part of the Centre division, where he rescued the flagship of commander Don John of Austria, the Real. When the Real was almost taken by the Ottoman janissaries, Colonna came alongside with the bow of his galley and mounted a counter-attack. With the help of Colonna, the Turks were pushed off the Real and the Ottoman flagship of Ali Pasha was boarded and swept. The entire crew of Ali Pasha's flagship was killed, including the commander himself. The banner of the Holy League was hoisted on the captured ship, breaking the morale of the Turkish galleys nearby.William Oliver Stevens and Allan F. Westcott, A History of Sea Power, 1920, p. 105-106. Entry of Marcantonio Colonna to Rome, 1571. Etching by Francesco Tramezzino. On Colonna's return to Rome, Pope Gregory XIII confirmed him as Captain General of the Church. In 1577 King Philip II named Colonna as Viceroy of Sicily. He was also Lord of Marino, then a village a few miles south of Rome, where the inhabitants honoured him with a great annual feast which still takes place today, under the name of \\"Sagra dell'uva\\". Colonna often stayed at Avezzano, where he had a fountain built and added a new floor in the castle, as well as a creating a loggia by the Fucine Lake. Later in his life he moved to L'Aquila, where he lived in the house now called the Palazzo Porcinari. He had seven children, including cardinal Ascanio Colonna, Fabrizio Colonna (the father of Marcantonio III Colonna and Filippo I Colonna) and countess Vittoria Colonna de Cabrera.

As of 2018, the principal is Steve Poll, his first year at Ben Lomond (2018/19). Ben Lomond High School History Ben Lomond High School was named for the nearby Ben Lomond Mountain, so called by Scottish settlers who were reminded of Ben Lomond in Scotland. This local cultural influence gave the school its theme, including bagpipers, Royal Stewart tartan, and Scots. Students are known as \\"Friendly Fighting Scots.\\" The school was originally to be called North East Ogden High School, with school colors of black and red and the spikes (a reference to the golden spike driven into the Transcontinental railroad) as the mascot; however, at the very first assembly held on the floor of the wood shop (the school was yet to be finished) the students said that since the school was closest to Ben Lomond it should be named hence. \\"We weren‚Äôt going to Ogden High and we didn't want to be called Ogden High,\\" one student recalled fifty years later. After renaming the school, the \\"Scot\\" became the mascot and the school's colors were changed to red, white and blue, the colors of traditional Scottish uniforms (Stewart tartan). Rivalry Ben Lomond has a long running rivalry with Ogden High School which culminates each year with a football game known as the \\"Iron Horse\\" game. The winner takes possession of a trophy called the Iron Horse, a statue of two trains to signify Ogden's well-known railroad history. In the most recent game, on October 16, 2019, Ben Lomond lost to Ogden High School 33-13. The rivalry also exists in basketball, although not as strongly. Renovations In June 2006, residents of Ogden passed a bond to obtain money to reconstruct and renovate Ben Lomond High and other Ogden City schools. A partial demolition commenced in June 2007 on Ben Lomond's library media center, English/Freshmen building, ceramics room, courtyard, boiler/furnace room, the ROTC drill field and two JROTC classrooms, and was completed in September 2007. Construction of a new building was completed in August 2010. This included the construction of new classrooms, cafeteria, commons area, Media Center, office area, and a \\"facelift\\" to areas not replaced by new construction, including the auditorium and gym areas. The entry of the school was changed to face 9th Street in a southeasterly direction, with a new address of 1080 9th Street. The renovation of Ben Lomond High School was awarded the Mountain States Construction Silver Award for grades K-12 in 2010. Hymn The School Hymn, written by Richard Packham, is sung to the tune of The Bonnie Banks O' Loch Lomond. The song is sung with crossed arms and swaying from side to side. The lyrics are: From the green Scottish hills where the proud pipers play, To the Great Salt Lake and the Wasatch, There's no better clan, nor will there ever be Than the Friendly Fighting Scots of Ben Lomond. We're proud of Ben Lomond and all that she stands for, And though o'er the earth we may wander, A part of our hearts will always yearn to be In the memory-hallowed halls of Ben Lomond.

He was also a soldier, MI6 operative, Master of Foxhounds and author. The son of a Southern Rhodesian farmer, Hastings had visited the country only briefly as a young child, but he grew up with tales of the veldt and the farm. A year after he was elected to Parliament, he accepted an invitation from the British South Africa Company to visit the country, and from then on made frequent visits, getting to know the leading white politicians. Over the next 20 years, Hastings devoted his political energies to injecting what he felt was much needed balance into the debate about Rhodesia's future. When Rhodesia's Prime Minister, Ian Smith, unilaterally declared the independence of Rhodesia in 1964, Hastings was a prominent member of the Rhodesia lobby opposing sanctions - against the official party line. Fourteen years later, he strongly supported the Internal Settlement between Smith and the moderate nationalist leaders under which Bishop Abel Muzorewa became Prime Minister, though effective power remained in white hands. He saw the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979, which created an independent Zimbabwe and led to Robert Mugabe's election, as a disaster caused by \\"unnecessary deference to the delusion of the Commonwealth, the Afro-Asian lobby and to the Americans by a series of British governments\\". Although Hastings claimed to have been invited to join Edward Heath's administration, his stance on Rhodesia effectively rendered him ineligible for office. Even Margaret Thatcher, whom he counted as an ally, kept him on the backbenches, though she recommended him for a knighthood in 1983. In his latter years at his Cambridgeshire home, Stibbington House, the only person whose photographs were displayed in more than one room (apart from those of his beloved late wife, Elizabeth Anne) were those of Smith. Early life He was born in London. His father had run away to Southern Rhodesia at the age of 17 after a disagreement with his father, and, after the First World War, bought a farm there. For the first two years of his life, Stephen lived with his parents on the farm; then he and his younger sister were sent home to England, where they were brought up by their doting and affluent maternal grandmother in Berkshire. Hastings was proud of his Scottish ancestry, among whose relations were the MacDonalds of Sleat. He had an abiding affection for his cousin the historian and journalist, Max Hastings. He learned to ride in Windsor Great Park, becoming an accomplished horseman. He attended Durnford School in Dorset (1929‚Äì34) and Eton College (1934‚Äì39). At Eton he managed to combine an undistinguished academic career, and with the clandestine help of his grandmother and her chauffeur, to engage in racing as an amateur jockey and, more importantly for his future, Hastings began a lifelong love for steeplechasing and fox hunting. Military career On leaving school, his grandmother offered to pull strings to enable him to pursue a career either as a racehorse trainer or in the Scots Guards. He chose the latter. Commissioned in the Scots Guards from Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in January 1940, Hastings saw action against the Italians and Germans in the Western Desert, taking part in Operation Crusader, which relieved Tobruk and threw Rommel out of Cyrenaica. After disagreements with his company commander he joined the SAS, and before El Alamein participated in a successful operation against an airfield, and a disastrous one against Benghazi, earning a Mention in Dispatches. Then, after being diagnosed with chronic bronchitis, he landed a job in Cairo as ADC to the Minister of State, Richard Casey. By mid-1943 Hastings was pronounced fit again, and joined SOE. His first assignment was to accompany the Franco- American landing in the south of France. He arrived in the newly liberated Paris in August 1944, then was dropped with a wireless operator and interpreter behind enemy lines in the Apennines as chief liaison officer to the Italian partisans. He found them demoralised and largely non-existent, but successfully trained and armed them, despite internal conflicts and frequent enemy attempts to capture him. By early April he had organised three divisions of about 4,000 partisans, which seized Piacenza and held a bridgehead over the River Po in a three-day operation. Hastings was constantly to the fore, coolly directing and encouraging his men while under constant machine-gun and mortar fire, according to the citation for his Military Cross. After the capture of Piacenza, Hastings and a few companions journeyed through German-held territory, and strode into the piazza of a seaside village on the Adriatic. Hastings thereupon convinced the German officer in charge that it would be in his best interest to provide them with a fine seaside villa and supplies of champagne for the weeks that it would take the Allies to arrive. At the end of April 1945, Hastings was in the Piazzale Loreto at Milan and saw the bodies of Benito Mussolini and Clara Petacci, who along with other executed fascists, were hanging upside down. He noted that Petacci's skirt had been pinned to her stockings to prevent her underwear from being revealed. Hastings considered this to be a perfect example of the often paradoxical delicacy of the Italian temperament. The Piacenza operation was universally considered a major contribution to the Allied advance. He also found time to assemble a scratch pack - the Brindisi Vale Hounds - which hunted a reported, but probably non- existent, fox. He was spared a posting to Nagasaki by a friend finding him a job in the economic division of the control commission in Austria, a post for which, he admitted at his interview, he had no relevant qualifications. When the friend returned to England, Hastings remained in Austria, taking a staff job with the Army with the sole duty of looking after the polo ponies, and occasionally played himself. He was then sent to a former Wehrmacht training centre, above the Judenburg in Styria, where he captained the British troops' ski-racing team but broke a leg during a competition against the French. 1948 onwards Finding peacetime duties unexciting, Hastings left the Army in 1948. He turned down an offer from Gillette and was refused a job by the BBC. Eventually he was invited by a friend to join MI6, which sent him in 1950 to Finland, disguised as an assistant military attach√©. Four years later he moved to Paris, where he observed the conspiracy over the Suez operation and the machinations that preceded Charles de Gaulle's return to power. From 1958 to 1960, he worked in the political office of the Middle East forces in Cyprus. As a result of his work countering the KGB, Hastings was one of the few Englishmen of his class and age to enjoy vodka neat, as well as the company of all and sundry. He, like his wife Elizabeth Anne, was utterly unsnobbish. The unproven imputations put forward in the book Spycatcher, in which Hastings was portrayed as participating in an attempt to destabilise the Harold Wilson government were always vehemently denied by him. The book's author, Peter Wright, was regularly denounced by Hastings as \\"that traitor\\", though no one knew exactly to what betrayal he was referring. His disgust at the Suez Crisis led to his putting his name down with Conservative Central Office as a candidate, and in 1960 he was offered the safe seat of Mid Bedfordshire; He won a 1960 by-election caused by the elevation to the peerage of Alan Lennox-Boyd. He retained his seat in the subsequent general elections in 1964, 1966, 1970, February 1974, October 1974, and 1979, but stood down at the 1983 general election, when he was succeeded by fellow-Conservative Sir Nicholas Lyell. Hastings quickly established his credentials on the Right of the party, becoming a stalwart of the Monday Club and an ally of the likes of Julian Amery and Ronald Bell. He served on various backbench committees, becoming a member of the executive of the 1922 Committee and vice-chairman of the Conservative backbench Foreign Affairs Committee. At the 1964 Conservative Party Conference, he was cheered to the rafters by conference delegates for a speech deeply critical of the party leadership; he was never invited to speak again. He could be an effective Commons performer. His self-confident, upper- class drawl and theatrical oratorical style enraged Labour MPs. He was often embroiled in controversy concerning Communist infiltration. In 1977 he alleged that five prominent trades union officials were agents for communist countries, based on tape recordings made by the Czech defector Josef Frol√≠k. The following year, before Margaret Thatcher came into office, Hastings and Brian Crozier wrote her a paper setting out \\"the diabolical nature of the Communist conspiracy\\" against Britain. At Hastings's suggestion she appointed a committee comprising Willie Whitelaw, Lord Carrington, Sir Keith Joseph and Hastings himself. This proposed forming a counter-subversion executive but the scheme was quietly dropped after the Tories came to power in 1979. In 1986 Hastings successfully sued The Observer newspaper for libel following allegations that he had been one of two Conservative MPs involved in an MI5 plot to oust Harold Wilson. Hastings remained a friend of Thatcher after his retirement from the Commons in 1983. He and his wife entertained the Thatchers and other notables at Milton Hall, the largest private house in Cambridgeshire. In 1982 Margaret and Denis Thatcher were at dinner with the Hastings at Milton when the butler entered to ask the Prime Minister to the telephone, by which Mrs Thatcher was informed of Argentina's invasion of the British South Atlantic island of South Georgia. This marked the start of the Falklands War. Outside his parliamentary duties, Hastings continued to ride, hunting regularly with the Fitzwilliam and other hunts. In 1982 he was elected chairman of the British Field Sports Society in succession to Sir Marcus Kimball. After retiring from Parliament, he became a partner and manager of the Milton Park Stud, a member of the council of the Thoroughbred Breeders' Association, and joint master of the Fitzwilliam Hunt. He had maintained his lifelong love of racing and each evening before dinner, a glass of champagne in hand, he would watch the races of the day, prerecorded by his butler. Hastings was chairman of the Peterborough Cathedral Development and Preservation Trust and helped raise millions of pounds for the Cathedral's restoration. He was patron of 32 livings, and took his duty to help provide priests for his parishes seriously. He and Elizabeth Anne could be found in the squire's pew at the Church of St Mary the Virgin, Marholm, any Sunday they were at Milton. Hastings was an accomplished painter, a fine sculptor, and wrote two books, The Murder of TSR2 (1966) and a well-received autobiography, The Drums of Memory (1995). He regularly skied in Switzerland until he was in his ninth decade, and hunted with the Fitzwilliam over forty times in the year before his death. Stephen Hastings married first, in 1948 (dissolved 1971), Harriet Tomlin, with whom he had a son Neil and a daughter Carola. He married secondly, in 1975, Elizabeth Anne Marie Gabrielle, the former Lady Naylor- Leyland. Lady Hastings was born the younger daughter of the 2nd and last Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent and Joyce Langdale of Houghton Hall, West Riding, Yorkshire, who secondly married Thomas Wentworth-Fitzwilliam, 10th and last Earl Fitzwilliam. In 1979 Lord Fizwilliam left the bulk of his great art collection and the estates of Milton, Cambridgeshire, Wentworth Woodhouse, near Doncaster, and Malton, North Yorkshire, as well as a grand town house in Belgrave Square to his widow, and to Elizabeth Anne, who was widely known in society as the daughter of Lord Fitzwilliam, a fact which she was known to confirm from time to time, though with reservations. Lady Hastings died from cancer at Milton in 1997. She was succeeded in her stewardship of the Fitzwilliam heritage by her son, Philip Naylor-Leyland, 4th Baronet. Sir Stephen Hastings died on 10 January 2005 at Stibbington House, Cambridgeshire, from oesophageal cancer.

He is best known for playing the accordion with Silly Wizard, as well as in other bands and in duets with his brother, Johnny.

The state-recognized resort of Adelsheim in the Neckar-Odenwald- Kreis looks back on a 1,200-year heritage.  Geography  Adelsheim lies at the mouth of the river Kirnau which comes from the west, emptying into the river Seckach coming from the north. The combined stream was used in building the town fortifications. Farther downstream, the Seckach flows by M√∂ckm√ºhl into the Jagst, thence into the Neckar, and thence into the Rhine. The Adelsheim area is part of the greater geographical region known as the Bauland, a mountain range stretching from the Odenwald in the northwest to the Jagst valley in the south as well as to the Tauber valley in the east. Part of the municipality's area lies within the Neckartal-Odenwald Nature Park. = Communities within the town =  Sennfeld (Baden)  Schloss Sennfeld Sennfeld lies about 3 km southwest along the Seckach valley and has about 1,250 inhabitants. The place was first mentioned in a document in 1110. In 1615, Margaretha von Carben, who was G√∂tz von Berlichingen's granddaughter, endowed the Evangelical parish church. The Sennfeld Schloss (stately home), formerly owned by kin of the Barons of Berlichingen, was built in 1713 in a countrified Baroque style.  Leibenstadt  Leibenstadt, a former knightly village with about 320 inhabitants lying south of Adelsheim was first mentioned in a document in 1293, and has been part of Adelsheim since 1971. Website: http://www.leibenstadt.de  Wemmershof  The hamlet of Wemmershof, lying 3 km west of Adelsheim, saw the beginning of its village history in 1423. In the Middle Ages, the landlords relinquished the property to the farmers who lived there at the time. Today Wemmershof is now, as then, a community shaped by agriculture, and it has about 50 inhabitants.  Hergenstadt  Hergenstadt lies to the southeast. It is a hamlet with about 50 people, founded in 1500.  Adelsheim Business Park  The Adelsheim Business Park (called Business-Park Adelsheim in German) is located 1 km to the west, outside the Adelsheim municipal centre and 8 km from Autobahn A81, right on Federal Highway B 292. The B 292 connects the towns of Adelsheim and Schefflenz and leads to Osterburken.  History  In 1374, Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor raised Adelsheim to town. The landlords were the Imperial Knights (Reichsritter) of Adelsheim. The Reichsritters von Adelsheim were eventually elevated to the rank of Freiherr (Barons of the Holy Roman Empire). Adelsheim was already home to some Jews in the Middle Ages. In 1338, Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor had allowed the brothers Poppo and Berlinger von Adelsheim to \\"keep\\" four Jewish families in their lands. Also in 1690, there were four Jewish families resident in Adelsheim. The establishment of an actual community can be traced back to the seventeenth century. The highest number of Jewish inhabitants was reached in 1885 when the count was 70. Under an ordinance from 1690, the Jewish community yearly had to pay the Barons of Adelsheim four gulden for \\"school\\", that is to say, to be allowed to hold their religious services. The prayer room used at that time, according to oral tradition, was set up on the second floor of the house built by Melchior Keller in 1418 in the Torgasse (\\"Gate Lane\\"). This house was dismantled in 1952. Later, there was a prayer room in a likewise no longer standing building in the yard of the Oberschloss. From the middle of the nineteenth century until 1889, a synagogue stood at Turmgasse 27. A ritual bath and a Jewish school were housed at the old synagogue in the nineteenth century at Turmgasse 27, and as of 1889 at the new synagogue (Untere Austra√üe 1). When the new synagogue was being torn down in 1977, the ritual bath was rediscovered. Burials were performed in Buchen-B√∂digheim and after 1884 in Sennfeld. After the deportations during the Third Reich, at least ten of the 35 Jews living in town in 1933 lost their lives. As a result of the Reformation, the people became Lutheran. Until 2000, Adelsheim was the seat of a deaconate of the Baden State Church, part of the Evangelical Church in Germany. In the course of deaconate reform, the deaconate moved to Hirschlanden in Rosenberg. Catholics are a minority. After 1945 a rough balance between the two faiths was reached through the arrival of refugees from the east. After 1960, a further Catholic church was established, St. Mary's. *The forerunner to the folk festival (Volksfest) was the Homeland Days (Heimattage) in 1948. The occasion for Adelsheim's second folk festival in 1949 was the celebration of the dedication of the new Kirnau Bridge, which replaced one destroyed in 1945. * On 11 November 1948, the Adelsheim District Agricultural School (Kreislandwirtschaftschule Adelsheim) opened its doors under Dr. Leopold Wiswesser's leadership. In the years that were to come, Adelsheim's history was shaped by its schools: the Volksschule moved onto the Eckenberg in 1958, and farther into the forest a few years later, the Gymnasium with its boarding school was established.

Adelsheim's town colours are black and white. The town colours are to be seen at the Schildm√§nnchen ‚Äì an emblem depicting a little man behind an heraldic shield ‚Äì near the centre of town at the Oberschloss-Erker (stately home).  Economy and infrastructure  = Transport = Adelsheim lies on the Frankenbahn railway (Adelsheim Ost or Sennfeld station) and the Neckartalbahn railway, and thereby also on the S-Bahn RheinNeckar (Adelsheim Nord station). Since December 2003 both hourly trains on S-Bahn line S1 (Kaiserslautern - Mannheim - Osterburken) and RegionalExpress trains every two hours (Mannheim - Eberbach - Heilbronn) run on this line. Goods trains run mainly evenings or nights. While line S2 ends in Eberbach, or every two hours in Mosbach-Neckarelz, S1 goes hourly through to Osterburken, giving Adelsheim optimal integration into the Frankenbahn (Stuttgart-W√ºrzburg) timetable. The town has a connection with Autobahn A 81 (Stuttgart - W√ºrzburg) through an interchange lying only 8 km from the centre of town. Federal Highway B 292 also runs through Adelsheim (Sinsheim - Mosbach - Adelsheim - Osterburken - Lauda-K√∂nigshofen). = Court and institutions = Adelsheim, owing to the large nearby youth penal institution, still has at its disposal a small local court, which belongs to the state court region of Mosbach and the higher state court region of Karlsruhe. = Educational institutions = * Evangelical and Catholic kindergartens * Primary school and Hauptschule with Werkrealschule * Eckenberg-Gymnasium with boarding school and the State School Centre for Environmental Education * Volkshochschule Adelsheim = Leisure = * Heated swimming pool, opening times: May‚ÄìSeptember 9‚Äì20 h * Miniature golf * Jugendhaus Adelsheim (youth centre), opening times: Thu-Sat 19-22:30 h (beyond the weekly opening times the centre also regularly organizes live band performances involving all kinds of musical styles, and various themed parties) * Live-Factory  Culture and sightseeing  * Gothic (old) Jakobskirche (church), built 1489 with many tombs on the inner and outer walls; great plague grave. * Ober- and Unterschloss (stately homes) * Town hall with fine half-timbering, 1619, completed and preserved by new building in contemporary style (about 1990). * Evangelical town church, late Baroque. * reconstructed town tower. * Town garden with waterfall lit at night. * Former synagogue in Sennfeld, built 1836. * Old mill * Baul√§nder Heimatmuseum Adelsheim ‚Äì open May‚ÄìSeptember Sundays 14-16 h or by telephoning to make arrangements. * For railway enthusiasts: Ostbahnhof (station) with outlying buildings, Nordbahnhof in late Gothic style with two waiting rooms. * \\"Lookout Bench\\" at Alt-Stadtrat Schmitt (especially for lovers). * Grand-Ducal Local Court with adjoining prison. * Jugendhaus Adelsheim, inaugurated about 1969, earlier housed on a nineteenth-century estate, now in a renovated railway station building. * Youth prison (block or box design from the early 1970s with distinctive \\"town wall\\"), built in a side valley off the Seckach valley. * Kirnau valley with remains of the Grand-Ducal irrigation works for ambitious agricultural projects. * Transmission tower at 49¬∞ 24' 38\\" N, 9¬∞ 23' 29\\" E (freestanding steel lattice construction, bearing until 1993 an SWR MW transmission antenna in the form of a long-wire antenna) = Clubs = Adelsheim: Since the war, there have been four clubs ‚Äì a singing club, a sport club, a youth club, and the fire brigade ‚Äì but a few others have come into being since then, although this traditional core is much the same as it always has been.

January 16, 2010. The Oketz Unit (, lit. sting), is the independent canine special forces (sayeret) unit of the Israel Defense Forces. History It was founded in 1939 as part of Haganah, and later dismantled in 1954. In 1974, a new unit was established by Yossi Labock, who was its first commander. The unit specializes in training and handling dogs for military applications. Originally, Oketz trained dogs to attack kidnappers, but training has since become more specialized, and now each dog is trained in a particular specialty. Attack dogs are trained to operate in both urban and rural areas (they were used extensively in Lebanon). Some dogs are trained to track and pursue selected targets for manhunts and to detect breaches at the Israeli border. Others are trained to search for guns and munitions, to sniff out hidden explosives, and to find people in collapsed buildings. Oketz operators are often assigned to other units when said units are in need of their specialist skills, for instance, the extraction of terrorists from fortified buildings. Though not affiliated with the IDF Paratroopers Brigade, Oketz operators wear the same distinctive red berets and the unit's graduation ceremony is held at the Paratroopers headquarters. However, in order to join Oketz, the recruit must choose the Kfir Infantry Brigade as their preferred choice in the request form and then pass the unit's trials. Dogs Oketz prefers the Belgian Shepherd (Malinois), over the German Shepherd and Rottweiler, which were formerly employed by the unit. The reasons for this preference are twofold: one, the Malinois is large enough to effectively attack an enemy while still being small enough to be picked up by its handler, and two, their coats are short and typically of a neutral to fair color, making them less prone to heatstroke.

He worked as a lawyer from a very early age, though without holding formal qualifications, and subsequently was an administrator for the government of the Republic of Venice. In 1570 he was procurator of St Mark's and, in the December of the same year, capitano generale da Mar of the Venetian fleet in the new war against the Ottoman Turks. He was the commander of the Venetian contingent at Battle of Lepanto (7 October 1571), in which the Christian League decisively defeated the Turks. After the peace he returned to Venice as a very popular figure, and in 1577, at the age of 81, he was unanimously elected Doge. He was married to Cecilia Contarini, who bore him a daughter, Elena Venier, and two sons. One of his sons, Francisco Venier, went to France. Sebastiano Venier died in 1578, allegedly of broken heart after a fire that had heavily damaged the Doge's Palace of Venice. He was interred in the Basilica di San Giovanni e Paolo, a traditional burial place of the doges.

Born in England, Goddard immigrated to Australia in 1890. He started an importing business and also became involved in the militia, being commissioned into the Queensland Defence Force in 1899. Following the outbreak of the First World War, he joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) after being in charge of the defences of Brisbane, where he lived. He commanded an infantry battalion during the Gallipoli Campaign. He suffered health issues and was repatriated to Australia but recovered and was soon serving as commander of the 35th Battalion on the Western Front. He led it through major engagements at Messines, Broodseinde and Passchendaele. During the Spring Offensive of 1918 he temporarily commanded the 9th Brigade at the First Battle of Villers- Bretonneux and Second Battle of Morlancourt. He became the brigade's permanent commander in late-May 1918, leading it through to the end of the war. After the war, he returned to the militia, retiring as a brigadier general in 1931. He died in Sydney in 1955. Early life Henry Arthur Goddard was born in West Hackney, Middlesex, England on 13 December 1869, the son of an insurance clerk. Goddard migrated to Australia in 1890 and settled in Brisbane. He appears to have worked as a clerk but then started an importing business, which involved extensive travel overseas. He experimented with growing malt barley on the Darling Downs. He was also consul for Paraguay from 1906 to 1915. As a young man in England, Goddard had been involved in the militia, serving with the Essex Rifle Volunteers. Despite the move to Australia, he remained interested in the military and in November 1899 he was commissioned into the Queensland Defence Force, serving as a lieutenant in the Moreton Regiment. His travels abroad allowed him to observe military manoeuvres in Europe and keep up to date with defence matters. By 1913 he was commander of the Moreton Regiment. First World War On the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, Goddard was placed in charge of the defences of Brisbane. In March the following year he joined the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) with the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was given command of the 25th Infantry Battalion, which he anticipated leading in active service overseas but two months later, following a reorganisation of the 2nd Division, he assumed command of the 17th Infantry Battalion. He took charge of the 17th Battalion on 12 May as it boarded the transport ship Themistocles, destined for Egypt. =Gallipoli= The 17th Battalion arrived in Egypt on 12 June 1915, remaining there until mid-August, when it moved to Anzac Cove at Gallipoli. However, Goddard remained in Egypt as he had been hospitalised with stomach trouble. On gaining medical clearance, he left for Gallipoli on the Southland; the ship was torpedoed en route on 2 September. Rescued by a ship of the Royal Navy, Goddard eventually arrived at Gallipoli four days later. At the time, the 17th Battalion was responsible for Quinn's Post, which was an exposed and dangerous position on the Allied line. He remained in command of Quinn's Post until the Anzac position at Gallipoli was evacuated. Suffering from dysentery, he was one of the last to leave Quinn's Post when it was abandoned on 20 December 1915. When the 17th Battalion arrived at Alexandria on 4 January 1916 after a short period at Lemnos, it proceeded to Tell El Kebir, a training centre for the AIF, four days later. Goddard's health, seriously impacted by the dysentery he had contracted at Gallipoli, was in decline and he was admitted to hospital shortly afterwards. In April, he was repatriated to Australia, arriving there on 18 May. =Western Front= By July, Goddard had recovered and returned to service with the AIF. He left for the United Kingdom on 1 August, sailing from Melbourne on board HMAT Miltiades, a troop transport. Reporting to AIF Headquarters in London in late September, he was shortly appointed commander of the 35th Infantry Battalion. His new unit was part of the 9th Infantry Brigade, 3rd Division, which at the time was in training on the Salisbury Plain in England. The 35th Battalion began its service on the Western Front in France in late November, being based in the area around Armenti√®res. In June the following year Goddard led it during the Battle of Messines. It later fought in the Battles of Broodseinde and Passchendaele. On occasions during the second half of 1917 he led the 9th Brigade on an acting basis while its regular commander, Brigadier General Charles Rosenthal, was absent. For his leadership at Messines, Goddard was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) in the 1918 New Year Honours. The citation for his DSO read: Worn out after its efforts at Passchendaele, the 35th Battalion spent the remainder of 1917 and the early part of 1918 in a quiet sector. During the Spring Offensive that commenced in late March, the 9th Brigade was moved forward to reinforce the defences in front of Villers-Bretonneux. On 30 March Goddard was ordered to move his battalion to the town to relieve the 61st Division. The size of the sector compromised the battalion's defensive capability so Rosenthal then sent the 33rd Battalion to provide support, delegating Goddard command of all Australian forces in the town. Goddard's headquarters was in Villers- Bretonneux itself, and when the Germans attacked on 4 April to commence the First Battle of Villers-Bretonneux, the Australians withdrew into the town. This placed Goddard's headquarters in the front line. He ordered a counterattack be mounted by 36th Battalion and, with the assistance of British cavalry, was able to hold the line. At the Second Battle of Morlancourt on 5 May 1918, Rosenthal again delegated Goddard to command of the main portion of the 9th Brigade. After five days of fighting, it was withdrawn. Then, on 21 May, following Rosenthal's appointment to command the 2nd Division, Goddard took over as the commander of the 9th Brigade. Soon afterwards he was promoted to full colonel and temporary brigadier general. He led the brigade at Bray- sur-Somme and the attack on the Hindenburg Line. By the end of the war, he had been mentioned in despatches three times and after the Armistice, was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1919 New Year Honours. He was also awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre. Later life Goddard was repatriated to Australia in January 1920 and was discharged from the AIF a few months later. On return to civilian life, he took up residence in Sydney and resumed his importing business, in which he was joined by his son Horace. He remained involved in the militia, commanding the 14th Infantry Brigade from 1921 to 1926. He was also honorary colonel of the 17th Infantry Battalion, which he had commanded at Gallipoli, and served as president of the Imperial Service Club for a number of years. He was placed on the retired list in 1931 with the rank of brigadier general. In his later years, he was commercial representative of The Times in Australia. He died at the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney on 24 October 1955, survived by his wife Elizabeth, who he had married in 1897, and two of the couple's three children. His remains were cremated.

He played the bassoon when in primary school, and at Bryanston School, Dorset, where he was one of the foremost musicians (bassoon and keyboards) of his generation. He attended Corpus Christi College, Cambridge as a choral scholar, where he studied music. He later became a prot√©g√© of Sir Edward Downes and gained experience conducting Verdi operas (as well as Prokofiev's War and Peace and Wagner's Meistersinger) in Australia, at the Sydney Opera House. Elder and his wife Mandy have a daughter, Katie. =The ENO and association with several orchestras= From 1979 to 1993, Elder was the music director of English National Opera (ENO). He was known as part of the \\"Power House\\" team that also included general director Peter Jonas and artistic director David Pountney, and which gave ENO several very successful years of productions. Elder has also served as principal guest conductor of the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra (1992‚Äì1995) and music director of the Rochester Philharmonic Orchestra (1989‚Äì1994).

He has been President of the London Philharmonic Choir from 2014 to the present. =Public pronouncements= He first conducted the Last Night of the Proms in 1987. He was scheduled to conduct again in 1990, but his remarks about the nature of some of the traditional Proms selections in the context of the impending first Gulf War led to his dismissal from that engagement. In 2006, he returned to conduct the BBC Symphony Orchestra for his second \\"Last Night\\" engagement, and used the traditional speech at the end of the concert to criticise aircraft baggage restrictions, in place following the uncovering of the 2006 transatlantic aircraft plot, which have made it difficult for musicians to carry their instruments on aircraft. In a reference to the fact that laptop computers are now allowed in aircraft cabins, Elder said, \\"...it seems to me that next year we should all look forward to 'Concerto for Laptop and Orchestra.'\\" He also made a plea for children to be given more opportunity to sing at school. =Honours= Elder was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 1989 Queen's Birthday Honours. He won an Olivier Award in 1991 for his outstanding work at English National Opera. He received the 2006 conductor prize of the Royal Philharmonic Society. In April 2007, Elder was one of eight conductors of British orchestras to endorse the 10-year classical music outreach manifesto, \\"Building on Excellence: Orchestras for the 21st Century\\", to increase the presence of classical music in the UK, including giving free entry to all British schoolchildren to a classical music concert. Elder was knighted in the Queen's Birthday Honours of June 2008. He was appointed Member of the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) in the 2017 Birthday Honours for services to music. =Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment= In addition to being involved in the above-named orchestras, Elder became \\"principal artist\\" of the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment in December 2011. As noted in the article: \\"His first project with the OAE as principal artist was [to give] a performance of Berlioz's Romeo and Juliet on 18 February 2012 at the Royal Festival Hall, London.\\" =Style= Describing his own conducting style, Elder has said that in contrast to Sir Adrian Boult, who was famously non-perspirational: :I'm quite a physical conductor. I remember seeing Adrian Boult backstage after the 1978 Proms and he was wearing a freshly ironed light blue M&S; shirt and he said to me \\"I see you're one of the sweaty ones.\\" =Recordings and writing= Elder has recorded for the Hyperion, NMC, Chandos, Opera Rara, and Glyndebourne record labels, as well as for the Hall√© Orchestra's own label. In addition to his conducting and recording activities, Elder also has written on music for The Guardian and other newspapers.

Early life and career William Grant was born on 30 September 1870 in Stawell, Victoria, the son of a miner. He was educated at Brighton Grammar School and Ormond College at the University of Melbourne, graduating with a Bachelor of Civil Engineering (BCE) in 1893. He worked in railway construction in New South Wales but after his father's death in 1894 he became a pastoralist, purchasing Bowenville Station on the Darling Downs in Queensland in 1896. Grant was commissioned as a lieutenant in the Queensland Mounted Infantry on 1 January 1901. He advanced rapidly and became commander of the 14th Light Horse in 1910, and was promoted from major to lieutenant colonel on 18 December 1911. He was still in command when the First World War broke out. First World War Grant joined the Australian Imperial Force on 16 March 1915, taking command of the 11th Light Horse Regiment. Part of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, it was sent to Egypt dismounted and there broken up on 26 August 1915. The 11th Light Horse Regiment was sent to Gallipoli, and there itself broken up, with a squadron being attached to each of the 2nd, 5th and 9th Light Horse Regiments. When the commander of the 9th Light Horse, Lieutenant Colonel Reynell was killed in the fighting for Hill 60 on 29 August 1915, Grant took over command of his regiment. He remained with the 9th Light Horse until he was sent for duty at the rest camp on 2 December 1915. When the 11th Light Horse was reformed in Egypt on 22 February 1916, Grant was given command again. At Romani, the 11th Light Horse formed part of a mobile column of light horse and took part in the defence of the Suez Canal. At Maghara in October, the 11th Light Horse led a column on a night march across the desert, navigating by the stars. On the second night of the march, dense fog closed in and hid the stars, but somehow Grant, who apparently had a phenomenal sense of position and direction, managed to lead the column through the desert to emerge at daybreak directly in front of the Turkish position. For his part in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign, Grant was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). On 14 February 1917, Grant led the 11th Light Horse out from Serapeum on a mission to sweep the remaining Turkish troops from the Sinai Peninsula. Grant learned from a British pilot that the Turks were evacuating, Nekhl, a significant town in the central Sinai, situated roughly in the centre of the Sinai, atop the desert ranges. His men entered Nekhl riding with fixed bayonets on 17 February. The light horse had travelled some 150 miles in seven days across steep and rocky mountain tracks. Only a few Turks and Arabs were captured, but the action marked the end of the campaign in the Sinai. In February 1917, the 4th Light Horse Brigade reformed and the 11th Light Horse Regiment rejoined it. On 13 August 1917, Grant became commander of the 3rd Light Horse Brigade and was promoted to temporary brigadier general. Then on 13 September 1917, he took over command of the 4th Light Horse Brigade, becoming a colonel and temporary brigadier general. The Desert Mounted Corps began its most famous campaign on the night of 30 October. The tactics were similar to those at Rafa and Magdhaba, with the mounted troops making a surprise night march, enveloping the left and rear of the enemy's position at Beersheba and attacking it from the east while the infantry attacked frontally from the south. The ANZAC Mounted Division was held up at Tel el Saba, the hill overlooking Beersheba, where the defenders held on until captured by the New Zealanders late in the day. Lieutenant General Harry Chauvel ordered Grant to attempt a mounted attack on Beersheba, his goal being to take the town wells before they could be destroyed. The light horse did not carry swords but had sharpened their bayonet points some days before in anticipation of such a tactic. The 4th and 12th Light Horse Regiments formed up with their squadrons in three lines, each about 300 to 500 metres apart. Wielding their bayonets like swords, they moved forward at a trot while the 13-pounders of the British Notts Battery suppressed Turkish machine guns. Grant initially rode in the lead, but dropped back to the reserve line once the column was headed in the correct direction so as to control their subsequent movements. Three Turkish batteries opposed the light horsemen but they moved forward so swiftly that the Turks could not range on them. The light horsemen swarmed over the Turkish positions and swept into the town, capturing all but two of the seventeen wells before they could be destroyed. For his part, Grant was personally decorated with a Bar to his DSO by the commander-in-chief, General Sir Edmund Allenby, the next day. Grant served as acting commander of the Australian Mounted Division from 15 December 1917 to 2 January 1918. During the raid on Es Salt in May 1918, Grant's 4th Light Horse Brigade was given the task of guarding the flank. When the plan failed, it was on his brigade that the main Turkish blow fell. The light horsemen fought hard but the Turks subjected them to fierce artillery and machine gun fire, and were able to drive them from their positions. Grant managed to avoid being overrun, and was able to withdraw by night without issue. Nine of the twelve British guns supporting the brigade were lost. Grant was blamed for the loss of the guns and for faulty defensive positions. In his final campaign, Grant was ordered to capture the town of Semakh, on the southern shores of Lake Tiberias. With only half his brigade available, Grant surprised the defenders with a quick night approach and a moonlight assault with drawn swords. Grant used his machine guns to reduce the enemy's fire. The garrison, half of whom were Germans, fought hard and the light horsemen had to fight from building to building, but the town was eventually captured. Grant commanded the Australian Mounted Division from 8 November 1918 to 24 December 1918. For his services, he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the 1919 New Year Honours. Post war Grant embarked for Australia on 29 April 1919, where he commanded the 1st Cavalry Brigade from 1920 to 1925. He retired from the Army in 1928. After the war Grant returned to his property at Bowenville but he sold it in 1931 and moved to Brisbane. Then in 1934 he purchased another property near Dirranbandi in southern Queensland. William Grant died suddenly from a heart attack on 25 May 1939 and was cremated with full military honours in Brisbane.

It is strongly associated with Wallum swampland. Description This species is a small species of frog, up to 15 mm in length. It is very similar to the common eastern froglet, and can only readily be distinguished by call and a white stripe on the throat that reaches all the way to the tip on the snout. Its dorsal surface is variable, it can range from grey to brown and is normally smooth in texture. The dorsal surface can be spotted, plain, however it is normally striped. The ventral surface is faintly marbled black and white. Ecology and behaviour This species is confined to acid paperbark swamps in wallum country. Males make a high pitched squeaking noise and call at any time of the year, when water is available. Males normally call from hidden positions in grass, while floating in the water. Breeding happens mostly during autumn and winter and occurs in large swamps and temporary ponds fringing the swamp. Eggs are laid singly on twigs and leaves in still water. Tadpoles are brown with arched tail fins, reaching almost 40 mm in size. Tadpole development takes nearly 6 months, with metamorph frogs ranging from 6‚Äì11 mm. The swamps that these frogs inhabit are coming under increasing threat by urbanisation. Sources *Anstis, M. 2002. Tadpoles of South- eastern Australia. Reed New Holland: Sydney. *Robinson, M. 2002.

He later served as Administrator of Nauru and of Papua New Guinea. Early life Thomas Griffiths was born on 29 September 1865 in the town of Presteigne, Radnor, Wales, the son of a builder. He was educated at the Old Vicarage, Wrexham, Denbighshire. After completing his schooling, he emigrated to Australia. Military career In 1886, Griffiths joined the Victorian Permanent Artillery as a gunner. Four years later, he became a military staff clerk at headquarters in Melbourne. He was promoted to regimental quartermaster sergeant in 1894 and the following year received a further promotion to warrant officer and became chief clerk of the Victorian Military Forces. After the Federation of Australia, he became a clerk in the Australian Military Forces, serving at the Adjutant General's office at Army Headquarters in Melbourne. In September 1908 he was appointed secretary to the Military Board with the honorary rank of lieutenant in the Administrative and Instructional Staff. He became an honorary captain on 30 August 1909. First World War At the time of the outbreak of the First World War, Griffiths held the rank of honorary major. He volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force (AIF) on 15 August 1914, and was appointed as a captain on the 1st Division staff. In January 1915, Major General William Bridges appointed Griffiths as his military secretary. On 28 March 1915 he became Deputy Assistant Adjutant General (DAAG) of the 1st Division. Griffith landed at Anzac Cove with the 1st Division Headquarters at around 7:30 am on 25 April 1915. He would serve throughout the Gallipoli Campaign. As DAAG, he was responsible for personnel and on most nights could be found on the beach, checking and sorting reinforcements, often under fire. On 12 May 1915, Griffiths became acting Deputy Assistant Adjutant and Quartermaster General (DAA & QMG). As such he was deputy to Lieutenant Colonel Cecil Foott, who was responsible for all administration and logistics in the 1st Division area at Anzac Cove. In June, Griffiths was promoted to major. In October 1915, Griffiths was transferred to the staff of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps, then under the command of Lieutenant General Sir William Birdwood. He acted as Birdwood's military secretary, and given responsibility for all matters concerning promotion. In effect, Griffiths became adjutant general of the AIF, and it would be through him that Birdwood administered the AIF. For his work at Gallipoli and in the subsequent reorganisation of the AIF in Egypt, Griffiths was mentioned in despatches and awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). In May 1916, with Birdwood now commanding I Anzac Corps which was intended for service on the Western Front, Griffiths was promoted to lieutenant colonel and formally became Assistant Adjutant General of the AIF. On 8 April 1917, and against his wishes, Griffiths became acting commandant of the AIF Headquarters in London. He was promoted to full colonel and confirmed in the post on 12 May 1917. As such he was responsible for the entire administration of the AIF, the handling of pay and promotions, the recording of deaths and casualties, the postal services and record keeping. Griffiths was also the representative of the Department of the Defence in dealings with the British War Office. On 1 January 1918, he became a temporary brigadier general. The war ended with Griffiths in Australia, having travelled there to work out medical policy with the Department of Defence. The armistice rendered his task moot, and he returned to London in December and resumed duty at AIF Headquarters for several months. He was discharged from the AIF on his return to Melbourne in September 1919. He was highly thought of by his superior, Brigadier General Brudenell White and Charles Bean wrote that he \\"was one of the great figures of the Australian Army.\\"Bean, 1941, p. 79 For his work, Griffiths was appointed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in January 1917 and Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in January 1919. Post war In March 1920, Griffiths became Inspector General of Administration at the Department of Defence but this was only for a short period before he took up an appointment as Administrator of New Guinea the following month. He served in this role for nearly a year. In 1921, he became Administrator of Nauru, a post he held until 1927, when he retired. His retirement was short lived; in 1929 he became head of the Commonwealth War Pensions Entitlement Appeal Tribunal. He returned to New Guinea as Administrator from 1932 to 1934, after which he retired. He attempted to come out of retirement again in 1938, when he unsuccessfully applied for the administrator position in Nauru. During the Second World War he served for a time in the Department of Defence Co-ordination. Griffiths died on 16 November 1947 and was buried with military honours in Melbourne General Cemetery. His wife, who he had married in 1891, predeceased him. The couple had two daughters.

It is located in the central city on the banks of the Avon River overlooking Victoria Square, opposite the former location of the demolished Christchurch Convention Centre. Due to significant damage sustained during the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake, it was closed until 2019. Council staff initially recommended demolition of all but the main auditorium, but at a meeting in November 2012, councillors voted to rebuild the entire hall. In 2020, the town hall was registered as a Category I heritage building. History The first Town Hall in Christchurch was built on the corner of Hereford Street and Cathedral Square, from where one would look down Sumner Road (since renamed High Street). The verandah was used as hustings for elections. Foyer of the Christchurch Town Hall The current building was part of an envisaged civic centre for Christchurch. Part I, the Christchurch Town Hall, was opened on 30 September 1972 by the Governor General, Sir Denis Blundell. The project was carried out by the then six metropolitan territorial local authorities, i.e. Christchurch City Council, Paparua and Heathcote County Councils, Riccarton and Lyttelton Borough Councils, and Waimairi District Council. Five of these local authorities were amalgamated in the 1989 local government reforms, and Lyttelton became part of Christchurch in March 2006, hence Christchurch City Council has sole responsibility for the venue these days. Part II, new civic offices as a replacement for the Civic in Manchester Street, to be built on the corner of Kilmore and Durham Streets, cutting Victoria Street off from going through Victoria Square, was not built. Instead, the Christchurch City Council purchased Miller's Department Store in Tuam Street in 1978 and fitted this building out as the new civic offices, occupying the building in 1980. A hotel stood in the place that was set aside for the civic offices across Victoria Street. Description The Christchurch Town Hall of the Performing Arts was designed for the presentation of a wide range of activities including orchestral concerts and recitals, opera, ballet and dramatic productions, musical comedy, variety, folk, rock and jazz concerts, conventions and conferences. It was designed by Sir Miles Warren and Maurice Mahoney of Warren and Mahoney Architects with acoustic assistance from Professor Harold Marshall. It hosts many civic functions, local cultural and commercial events, shows, and concerts. It is home to the Christchurch Symphony Orchestra, the Christchurch City Choir and several theatrical amateur groups. It has a 2,500-seat auditorium known for its acoustics and the 1,000 seat James Hay Theatre. The Town Hall has several rooms that complemented the Christchurch Convention Centre, but the venue on the opposite side of Kilmore Street was demolished in March / April 2012. The Rieger pipe organ is also in the Christchurch Town Hall of the Performing Arts Auditorium and the curator is international concert organist Martin Setchell. It also has the Limes Room, Cambridge Room and two Conference Rooms which are used for various functions and conferences. On the ground floor of the complex is Boaters Restaurant, which is run by the Christchurch Polytechnic Institute of Technology as a training venue for the hospitality industry. Earthquake damage The Town Hall was closed as a result of significant damage caused by the February 2011 Christchurch earthquake from liquefaction and the related lateral spreading of the ground towards the Avon River. In June 2011, an assessment of the building was underway to determine the extent of the damage. In October 2012, a staff report recommended that only the main auditorium be saved, with the rest of the building to be demolished. On 22 November 2012, Christchurch councillors voted unanimously to rebuild it at a cost of $127.5 million, only $68.9 million of which would be covered by insurance. Earthquake Minister Gerry Brownlee could still however veto the plan. In August 2013, council staff presented four options to city councillors that would all retain the building, at a cost of around NZ$125m. =Restoration= On 11 June 2015 confirmation was given by the Christchurch City Council on the decision for the repairs of the Christchurch town hall to go forward. Work started in November 2015 with the foundations, which will be replaced; new concrete columns will be installed into the ground to help support and stabilise the building. The project will also add improvements to the town hall's design ‚Äì for instance, the James Hay theatre, main auditorium, and restaurant will be modified to fix issues present in the original layout.

Early life and career Harold William Grimwade was born on 18 May 1869 in St Kilda, Melbourne, the son of Frederick Sheppard Grimwade. Harold was educated at Melbourne Grammar School and the Queen Elizabeth School in Ipswich, Essex, England. He qualified as a pharmacist in London before returning to Australia. He became Felton Grimwade's warehouse manager and a partner in the company in 1893. In this role he displayed a considerable talent for leadership and management of employees. Grimwade joined the Victorian Field Artillery in 1891 and was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 16 May 1910. In August 1914, he became Chief Embarkation Officer for Victoria. First World War Grimwade joined the Australian Imperial Force as a lieutenant colonel on 26 August 1915 to command the 4th Field Artillery Brigade, a new unit formed for the 2nd Division. The formation of the 2nd Division Artillery drained Australia of guns and instructors and left the artillery in Australia badly depleted. The 4th Field Artillery Brigade embarked for Egypt on 8 November 1915, arriving on 12 December. The 2nd Division Artillery thus missed the Gallipoli Campaign and instead began intensive training for France. Initially the 4th Field Artillery Brigade was to be reassigned to the 4th Division but General Sir Archibald Murray ruled that the artillery must be provided on the British Expeditionary Force standard of 15 batteries per division rather than on the MEF one of just 9. Whereas the infantry in Egypt had to expand from 32 battalions to 48, the artillery was faced with an expansion from 18 batteries to 60. Priority was given to getting the 1st and 2nd Divisions' Artillery ready, and the 4th Field Artillery Brigade departed Alexandria for France on 12 March 1916. On 10 July 1916, Grimwade was promoted to colonel and temporary brigadier general and appointed General Officer Commanding Royal Artillery (GOCRA) of the 3rd Division Artillery. Grimwade remained there training his new command for some months, until the 3rd Division Artillery was finally deployed to France on 31 December 1916. Although the division carried out a number of raids, its first major operation was at Messines in June 1917. For this battle, Grimwade had not only his own two brigades but also the AIF's three \\"Army\\" brigades (3rd, 6th and 12th) and two British brigades, a total of 120 18-pounder guns and 30 4.5-inch howitzers. At Broodeseinde on 4 October 1917, Grimwade had his two brigades plus five British brigades. German counter-battery fire was fierce and the artillery and ammunition columns came under heavy fire. Despite casualties of the same order as the infantry, the gunners managed once again to produce a tremendous barrage, enabling the infantry to advance. In January 1918, Grimwade was promoted to colonel in the Australian Military Forces. In a quiet sector of the line near Messines the 3rd Division, now part of the Australian Corps, spent the winter preparing for a German Offensive in the Spring. Grimwade and John Monash clashed with the new Corps Chief of Staff, Major General Brudenell White, over the placement of the artillery, which they felt was too far forward and would be overrun in the event of an enemy offensive. In the event, the initial German blow fell on the Somme sector to the south and the 3rd Division Artillery was rushed south to defend the river. For the Battle of Amiens on 8 August 1918, Grimwade had control of 9 brigades of field and horse artillery. They fired the initial barrage and then took up defensive artillery positions. The gunners fired in support of the advance to the Hindenburg Line and beyond, and remained in the line after the infantry had been withdrawn, firing in support of the British and American armies. On 14 November 1918, Grimwade became GOCRA of the Australian Corps. In response to a strike by men of the 3rd Division Artillery in January 1919,Australian Imperial Force Unit War Diaries, 'Headquarters 8th Australian Field Artillery Brigade', January 1919, AWM4 13/36/32, Australian War Memorial, p. 9. https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/C1355597 Grimwade resumed command and listened sympathetically to their troubles, attempted to rectify what he could, and promised to pass the rest on to an equally sympathetic corps commander, Lieutenant General Talbot Hobbs. Grimwade had been made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1917 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1918 and had been Mentioned in Despatches four times. He returned to Australia on 27 February 1919. Post war From 1926 to 1930 Grimwade commanded the 4th Division. He died on 2 January 1949.

This flag is also one of the main flags still used by the Karavas at their ceremonies. Karava () also Karave, Kara and Kaurawa is a Sinhalese caste from Sri Lanka. The Tamil equivalent is Karaiyar. They are traditionally coastal people occupied in seafaring, fishing and naval warfare. They have in recent times given great importance to trade and commerce. The elite families are involved in the estate-owning sector, chiefly in coconut and rubber.  Etymology  The origins of the term Karava are still debated. The name might be a modified word of the Tamil Karaiyar, where \\"Karava\\" share the same root word kara or karai meaning \\"coast\\" or \\"shore\\" in Tamil.Vaduga: Sri Lanka and the Maldive Islands, By Chandra Richard De Silva, p.111 & 137 The name \\"Karava\\" has also been proposed to be a corruption of the Sanskrit name Kaurava, following their origin myth. The first recorded instance is the Abhayagiri vihara terrace inscription dating from the 1st century BC denoting a Dameda Karava navika which means Dravidian or Tamil sailor. Other historical counts refer them and also the Karaiyars as Careas and Kaurawar.  History  Many Karava communities throughout Sri Lanka claim an origin from the Kuru kingdom and the Kauravas of the Hindu epic Mahabharata. For instance, Kurukulattaraiyan was the name ascribed to 'the prince who wore a golden anklet' that commanded the army of Vijayabahu I (11th century AD) to end Chola rule in Sri Lanka. Historical manuscripts such as the Mukkara Hatana indicate that there were migrations from the Kurumandalam coast of Tamil Nadu, South India, and that they were originally Tamil speakers. The Karavas north of Negombo are predomanantly Catholic and bilingual in Tamil and Sinhalese, whereas the Karavas south of Colombo are Buddhist and completely Sinhalized. The Mukkara Hatana describes that they won a three month siege against the Mukkuvars, under the sponsorship of Kotte king Parakramabahu VI in the 14th century AD. The Kotte King Bhuvanaikabahu VI was the son of a Karava chief who was adopted by Parakramabahu VI after the death of his father in the war mentioned in Mukkara Hatana.A. Sebastian, A Complete Illustrated History of Sri Lanka. Vijitha Yapa Publications, 2012. p 397. The Karava chieftains resisted the colonial Portuguese rule in 16th century. The Karava Prince of Uva, Kuruvita Rala (also known as Antonio Barreto), who also had his stronghold in Batticaloa, Wellawaya, Negombo and parts of Sabaragamuwa and Matara region, led his and the troops of Sitawaka Kingdom and revolted against the Portuguese. Kuruvita Rala also raided the Kandy Kingdom and drove the king Senarat of Kandy out of his own capital. They were under Portuguese rule, along with the Karaiyar and Nair recruited as Lascarins and were converted to Catholicism. Large Catholic Karava communities exists ever since, who were Hindus prior to conversion. The Catholic Karava chieftains sided with the Kingdom of Kandy and the kingdom's Dutch allies against the Portuguese empire, and the King bestowed honors and titles to the Karava chieftains. The Karavas amassed wealth through commercial ventures such as in arrack, coconut, rubber, graphites etc. The Karavas formed the elites between 16th century and early 20th century. Numerous organization were formed by them such as Ceylon National Association, one of the predecessors of the Ceylon National Congress. James Peiris, a Karava lawyer and national leader, was an essential character in the Sri Lankan independence movement. Rohana Wijeweera and other Karava leaders formed in the 1960s the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, a communist party and political movement, who were involved in two armed uprisings against the ruling governments in 1971 and 1987.  Traditional status  The Karavas were coastal people, who served in naval warfare and contributed as coastal chieftains and regional kings. Their chiefs were referred in Sinhalese as Patabendi or Patangatim,Patangatin/Headmen of Chilaw baptised in 1606 at Malwana; Ceylon and the Portuguese 1505‚Äì1658, by Paulus Edward Pieris which is derived from the Tamil term Pattamkattiyar (meaning \\"crowned one\\"), which was also used by their equivalent Tamil Karaiyars.

D. Raghavan pp.33‚Äì6,43,66,71‚Äì5 (K.V.G. De Sƒ´lva ) ASIN: B0006CKOV2 A large number of these Karava flags have survived the ravages of time and many are illustrated in E. W. Perera's book Sinhalese Banners and Standards. The sacred usage of conch shell and tying of Nalapata (royal forehead plate) was a common practice among Karavas, also mentioned in the Rajaveliya. The sun and the moon, pearl umbrella are traditional royal symbols used by the Karavas. The Makara, being an emblem of their clan, is the mount of their clan deity, the sea god Varuna. Insignia such as the pearl umbrella, flags, swords, trident, yak tail whisks, lighted flame torches and drums were previously widely used by the Karavas at their weddings and funerals. By the 1960s, such usage has been greatly reduced, whereas some places is it still practiced.  Ancestral names  The Karava's use the vasagama naming system. Vasagama, literally meaning \\"estate (gama) in which one resides\\", is a title or surname that is given to the patrilineal descendants. The most common clans among the Karavas are Kurukulasuriya, Varunakulasuriya and Mihindikulasuriya (formerly known as Arasakulasuriya). Other clans are Koon Karavas and Konda Karavas. Names based on leadership or military activity include Aditya (chief/noble), Arasanilayitta (\\"royal authority\\"), Arasa Marakkalage (\\"house of the Royal Mariners\\"), Patabendige (\\"house of the local headmen\\"), and Thantrige (also Tantulage or Thanthulage, \\"house of experts\\").Royal grant to a port Patangatin, Kingdom of Jaffanapatam, P.E.

As a songwriter, he wrote the song \\"I've Been Everywhere\\" which was an Australian hit for Lucky Starr in April 1962 and became popular in North America when adapted for Hank Snow in November. More than 130 cover versions have been recorded. In 2008, Mack was inducted into the Australian Roll of Renown. Biography Born on 20 December 1922 in Surrey Hills, a suburb of Melbourne. His father was William Arthur Henry McElhinney, and his mother was Ethel Mary (n√©e Park).

In 1944 whilst serving in Borneo, his ability to play the guitar and sing was noticed, and he was seconded to entertain the troops with visiting guest stars. In May 1946, Mack was an ex-serviceman performer on a theatre concert, who \\"was responsible for most of the laughs with his vocal gymnastics, his number, 'In Der Fuhrer's Face', being a gem of its kind, which had the audience in hysterics.\\" At the end of the war, Mack went to Japan with the Occupation Forces to perform, and was appointed to Radio WLKS as the voice of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces. In August 1950, he returned to Australia after performing for British, American, French, German, and Japanese audiences, including his rendition of \\"Waltzing Matilda\\".

In American colleges, this period is known as a Reading Period.https://yalecollege.yale.edu/new-students/transfer-students/general- academic-information/reading-period Generally, this period is one week long and free of classes or assessment, permitting students to spend the period revising material, generally in preparation for final exams. It is not often allocated for mid-semester or ongoing assessment. Each day of such a period may be referred to as a reading day. The term \\"revision week\\" is chiefly used in Commonwealth countries, where it is also known as \\"swotvac\\" or \\"stuvac\\". For post-secondary institutions in anglophone Canada, it is common to have \\"reading week\\" or \\"mid-term break\\" during the third week of February, coinciding with Family Day. While in francophone Canada, \\"semaine d'√©tudes,\\" \\"semaine d'activit√©s libres,\\" or \\"semaine de lecture,\\" typically falls on the first or second week of March. Some Canadian post-secondary institutions have even adopted reading weeks for the fall academic term, either in October or November, typically coinciding with Thanksgiving or Remembrance Day respectively. In the US this period is generally referred to as reading period or (as slang) dead week or dead days. Swotvac The term swotvac (swot vac, swotvac) is commonly used in Commonwealth countries, particularly Australia, to refer to this period. The term is a blend of the swot and vac (vacation), indicating the period free of classes. \\"Swot\\" (or less commonly swat) is a dialectal word (Scottish) originally meaning \\"to sweat\\", which found use as a slang word describing a student paying careful attention to his work. Swot as a verb suggests acting like a swot, studying for one's exams. The use of the uncommon and outmoded word 'swot' has led to the backronym Study Week Or Take VACation or Study WithOut Teaching (or Tuition) VACation. There are many other different backronyms that can be derived, and the term stuvacThe joys of Stuvac, by Asako-Sophia, 2006-10-1 (STUdy VACation, STUdent VACation) is also found. Though once popular and used by universities as the official name for the week, the term seems to have fallen from favour and replaced with study week. As of 2014, however, it is still used by at least three of Australia's Group of 8 universities on the academic calendar. Timing It is scheduled after all the regular class lectures and before final exams. In some universities, reading days in the Fall semesters are being scheduled two days before Thanksgiving holidays to extend the holiday weekend like a spring break. However, this break is followed by the last week of classes and final examination week. Duration In many cases, student governments have lobbied to introduce, extend, or preserve reading days as a day exclusively for study and have run into conflict with teachers who like to use it as an additional day for lectures or exams.Officials review SGA proposal - News Another issue is that some students may prefer to take exams on reading day in order to get the semester over with.Exam period format adds to stress levels - University See also * Dead week *Schoolies week, vacation week following exams *Study skills References External links *Reading day policy out of touch with students, The Daily Campus, 11 November 2015 *OPINION: Reading day: Wrong place, wrong time, Technician, Charlie Melville, Correspondent 27 Apr 2017 * Editorial: UConn must have early weekday reading days, The Daily Campus, 27 April 2017 * Therapy dogs, chocolate, Play-Doh: Universities offer ways to cope with finals, The College Fix, Jeremy Beaman, 8 May 2017 Category:Academic culture Category:Education terminology ","title":"Revision week"},{"id":"4872550","text":"Bunny is a 1998 American computer-animated short film by Chris Wedge and produced by Blue Sky Studios.Watch 3 Early Animated Shorts by 'Epic' Director Chris Wedge Including the Oscar Winner 'Bunny' - Film School Rejects It was featured on the original DVD release of Ice Age from 2002 and its 2006 \\"Super Cool Edition\\" re-release to coincide with the release of Robots, which was also directed by Chris Wedge.

Bunny won the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film in 1998 as well a Golden Nica at the Prix Ars Electronica. Plot Bunny, an elderly female rabbit, lives alone in a small cabin in the forest. While baking a cake one night, she is continually bothered by a large moth that keeps flying around her kitchen. No matter what she does, she cannot get rid of the intruder; she is especially annoyed when it runs into a photograph, taken many years ago, of herself and her late husband on their wedding day. Eventually she knocks it into the cake batter, which she quickly and angrily pours into a pan and shoves into the oven. She then sets the kitchen timer and falls asleep, only to be awakened by loud rumblings and blue-white light coming from the oven, whose door soon falls open. Crawling inside, she finds herself confronted by the moth and begins to float through an otherworldly space toward the source of the light, with a pair of giant moth wings sprouting from her back to propel her as the insect leads her along. She is soon revealed to be among dozens of moths being drawn to the light. The film ends with a close-up of the wedding photo, which comes to life as the younger Bunny nestles her head contentedly on her husband's shoulder; the shadows and reflections of two of the moths play across the image as well.1999 Bunny: Free Download, Borrow, and Streaming: Internet Archive During his introduction to the film on the Ice Age DVD & VHS, Wedge offers his take of these events: Bunny dies in her sleep, and the oven serves as a gateway to the afterlife.

Rauhe has won 13 world championship gold medals, the most by a male kayaker; now with 23 World medals, in 2011 he exceeded the 20 of his compatriot, Torsten Gutsche. Early career Rauhe was selected for the 1997 World Junior Championships in Lahti, Finland at the age of just fifteen years nine months. Competing against paddlers up to three years older he won two medals ‚Äì gold in the K-4 500 m and silver in the K-1 500 m, an unprecedented achievement for a fifteen-year-old. After winning three more gold medals at the next edition of the world junior championships in Zagreb, Croatia, in 1999 he stepped up to the senior German national team. Senior career At the age of seventeen, he enjoyed immediate success, taking the bronze medal in the men's K-1 200 m World Championship final the same year. Since 2000, the Rauhe/Wiesk√∂tter partnership has enjoyed unrivalled success, winning the major K-2 500 m race from 2001 to 2007 (six world titles and the 2004 Olympic gold). The pair have also won eight straight European championships over 500 m (2000‚Äì2008; there was no championship in 2003). Rauhe also dominated the K-1 200 m individual sprint, winning three consecutive golds in both the world and European championships before losing out to Spain's Carlos P√©rez in 2005. If Rauhe's rivals hoped this marked the beginning of a decline in the German's fortunes they were to be disappointed. In 2006 Rauhe was back on top form and won more titles than ever before. At the European Championships in Raƒçice, Czech Republic he won three gold medals, retaining his K-2 500 m title, regaining the K-1 200 m crown from P√©rez and winning the K-2 200 m for the first time in his career. These three victories were repeated at the World Championships in Szeged, Hungary. Rauhe's dominance was best illustrated by his victory in the K-2 200 m final in a race that was scheduled just twenty minutes after his K-1 final (and against a field of rested opponents none of whom had competed in the earlier race). At the World Championships in his home country Germany in 2007, he and his partner Tim Wiesk√∂tter won again the K-2 500 m and came second in the K-2 200 m. On the national level, he has won 50 national titles at the German Championships. His 50th title was the 500 m in the K-1 on 2 May 2009 in Duisburg. In June 2015, he competed in the inaugural European Games, for Germany in canoe sprint, more specifically, Men's K-2 200m with Tom Liebscher. He earned a silver medal. At the 2016 Summer Olympics, he won the bronze medal in the K-1 200 metres event, recording the same time (to a thousandth of a second) as Sa√∫l Craviotto ‚Äì wiping out the memory of his greatest competitive disappointment, finishing last in the final heat of this event four years previously at the London Olympics.

On May 10, 1945, Halyburton was serving with a Marine rifle company against the Japanese on Okinawa when they suffered numerous casualties after advancing into Awacha Draw. Exposed to enemy fire, he rushed to aid a fallen Marine the furthest away. Shielding the man with his own body while administering aid, Halyburton was mortally wounded. For this action, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. He was one of two people from Haywood County, North Carolina, to receive the medal in World War II, the other being Max Thompson. Halyburton is buried at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific at Honolulu, Hawaii.

He was known best as the editor of Future Science Fiction, Science Fiction, and Science Fiction Quarterly, among many other crime-fiction, western, sports-fiction, and other pulp and digest sized magazines for Columbia Publications. Among the most famous writers he was first to publish at Columbia was mystery writer Edward D. Hoch, who in turn would contribute to Lowndes's fiction magazines as long as he was editing them. Lowndes was a principal member of the Futurians. His first story, \\"The Outpost at Altark\\" for Super Science in 1940, was written in collaboration with fellow Futurian Donald A. Wollheim, uncredited. Lovecraftian work Lowndes was also a horror enthusiast‚Äîas a young fan, he received two letters of encouragement from H. P. Lovecraft in 1937.An H.P. Lovecraft Encyclopedia edited by S. T. Joshi and David E. Schultz, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2001 (pg. 158). The two Lovecraft letters are reprinted in Crypt of Cthulhu Volume 8, No 3 (Whole number 62)(Candlemas 1989), a special issue devoted to Lowndes. He wrote a number of dark fantasy stories such as \\"The Abyss\\" (1941) (reprinted in \\"Revelations from Yuggoth\\" No 2 (May 1988) and \\"The Leapers\\" (1942), inspired by Lovecraft. The Crypt of Cthulhu tribute issue also reprints Lowndes' Lovecraftian stories \\"Leapers\\" (a shorter version, first published as by 'Carol Grey' appeared in the Dec 1942 issue of Future Fantasy and Science Fiction; a revised version appeared in the Magazine of Horror; and the Crypt of Cthulhu version represents a third and final revision, with a new intro by Lowndes explaining its publication history) and \\"Settler's Wall\\" (a shorter version of the latter as \\"The Long Wall\\" by 'Wilfred Owen Morley' was published in the March 1942 issue of Stirring Science Stories and was twice revised for later publication). The Lowndes tribute issue also includes two Lovecraftian poems, \\"The Burrowers Beneath\\" and \\"Forbidden Books\\" (which also appeared under the 'Wilfred Owen Morley' pseudonym in Stirring Science Stories for April and July 1941 respectively); along with two critical articles by Lowndes which first appeared in Magazine of Horror, and an essay on Lowndes - \\"Lowndes, Lovecraft and the Health Knowledge Years\\" by Mike Ashley. Lowndes also wrote a series of poems inspired by Lovecraft's Fungi from Yuggoth - \\"The Annals of Arkya\\", which he followed up with \\"The New Annals of Arkya.\\" The 12-sonnet sequence \\"Annals of Arkya\\"was reprinted in Crypt of Cthulhu 10, No 3 (Whole number 78) (St John's Eve, 1991). These have also been reprinted in an issue of Shawn Ramsey's \\"Revelations from Yuggoth\\". His nonfiction \\"A Tribute to H. P. Lovecraft\\" appears in Peter Cannon, ed. Lovecraft Remembered (Arkham House, 1988). The Health Knowledge magazines In 1963, Lowndes initiated the Magazine of Horror (1963‚Äì1971) for Health Knowledge Inc., which mixed reprints with new stories.Mike Ashley, Transformations: the story of the science-fiction magazines from 1950 to 1970. Liverpool University Press, 2005 (p.289) The magazine was popular and spawned several companion magazines: Startling Mystery Stories, Famous Science Fiction (both 1966) Weird Terror Tales (1969) and Bizarre Fantasy Fiction (1970). Lowndes also edited two non-fantastic- fiction magazines for the company, Thrilling Western Magazine (1967) and World Wide Adventure (1967), along with the speculative nonfiction titles they published. However, the collapse of Health Knowledge in 1971 ended these magazines.Peter Nicholls and John Clute, Encyclopedia of Science Fiction, page 738. Startling Mystery Stories was notable for carrying the first stories of Stephen King and F. Paul Wilson.John Clute and John Grant, Encyclopedia of Fantasy, page 611. Lowndes subsequently went on to work on the Gernsback Publications' non-fiction magazine, Sexology. In 1991 he received the First Fandom Hall of Fame award.

(popularly known as Lado Guitars, also J.K. Lado & Co. as seen on early-model headstocks) is a Canadian guitar manufacturing company owned and operated by Joe Kovacic (artistic name \\"Joe Lado\\"). The company is based in Lindsay, Ontario and produces electric guitars and basses. Vintage- custom, hand made Lado guitars remain some of the most sought after guitars in the world to date.  History  Joseph Kovacic was born in Croatia in 1945. After serving in the Yugoslav People's Army, he began training as a luthier at the Zagreb School of Guitar Making in Zagreb, followed by two years additional training at Crossman Guitar Works in Vienna, Austria. Joe immigrated to Canada from Croatia in 1968 and began working for Turner Musical Instruments, a division of Gibson for two years, followed by a job with Hagstr√∂m Guitars as an inspector for one year. In 1971, having reached a workable level of English, Joe began his own business called \\"Joe's Strings\\" from a basement shop on Gerrard Street, in Toronto. In 1973, he formed \\"Lado Musical Inc.\\" and opened a retail shop on Kingston Road, in Toronto. In addition to building Lado Guitars, Lado had an exclusive repair contract with C.F. Martin Guitars for all of Canada. Around 1976, the demand for Lado Guitars had grown so much that he moved to a bigger facility in Scarborough. The 1981 Lado catalogue shows Lado Guitars to have moved again to a new facility ‚Äìthis time located on R.R. #1 in Uxbridge, Ontario, with a photographed staff of 13 employees. In 1987, Lado built a 14‚Äô 3\\" tall, 309 lb \\"Earth\\" model guitar, deemed \\"largest built and presumably the loudest playable electric guitar\\" by the Guinness Book of World Records. The record was held from 1987-1991. The 1988 Lado catalogue shows Lado Guitars to have moved from the Uxbridge factory to a new one on Warden Avenue, in Scarborough, ON. In the 1988 film Eddie and the Cruisers II: Eddie Lives!, the band can be seen playing Lado guitars and basses. In 2003, Kovacic started the \\"Lado School of Lutherie\\", a way to slow down his pace as he was reaching retirement, and also to pass on his craftsmanship and trade secrets to a younger generation of luthiers. Today, Lado Musical Inc. is located in Lindsay, Ontario.  The story behind the \\"Lado\\" name  As his major final assignment as a lutherie student, he built a double bass which, upon completion, he gave to a famous Croatian professional folk dance group called \\"LADO\\", named after a Slavic word often used as a refrain in ceremonial songs of Croatia, and is a synonym for words meaning \\"good\\", \\"love\\", and \\"dear\\". In return for their beautiful handcrafted double bass, the Lado group told Joe that he had their blessing to use the Lado name for his instruments.  Distinctive characteristics of a Lado instrument  * Headstocks always shown the image of a falcon along with the name of the company. It is not to be confused with an eagle or a hawk. * Necks are made of multiple laminates of hardwood, rather than one solid block.

Niles (November 23, 1888 - September 28, 1952; Boston, Massachusetts) was an American political advisor who worked in the White House from 1942-1951 for the administrations of Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman. Niles was one of only two Roosevelt aides retained by Truman upon his assumption of the presidency.  Childhood  Born and raised in Boston's South End, Niles was the eldest of six children who survived to adulthood. His parents were Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire, Asher K. Neyhus and Sophie Berlin, from Rivne and Suwalki respectively. He and his father kept the middle initial \\"K\\" to honor their heritage as kohanim. While in attendance at Brimmer Grammar School, Niles became acquainted with author Edward Everett Hale, who became a mentor to Niles as he \\"supplied the boy with reading material and urged him in his ambition to acquire knowledge\\".  Entry into politics  While in high school, he Anglicized his surname Neyhus to Niles, reportedly inspired by his classmate, figure skater Nathaniel Niles. He graduated from the prestigious Boston Latin School in 1906, but went to work at a department store to support his family. Through attending lectures at Boston's Ford Hall Forum, he caught the eye of its head, Republican George W. Coleman, who took the young Niles under his wing. During World War I, Coleman took Niles with him to Washington D.C. to work in the US Department of Labor's Information Office. Upon his return to Boston post-war, Coleman promoted Niles to the position of Assistant Director of the Ford Hall Forum, where he would later himself become director (1921-1952). Through his position at the Ford Hall Forum, Niles was asked by Wisconsin Senator Robert La Follette and Montana Senator Burton Wheeler to aid their bid for presidency and vice presidency of the United States with the Progressive Party in 1924. He headed the speakers' bureau, and though the campaign failed abysmally, he was able to gain political insight from the experience. In the aftermath of the La Follette presidential campaign, he attracted the attention of Harvard lawyer Felix Frankfurter, who was then defense counsel for the Sacco-Vanzetti trial, and the two began to work together, forming a lifelong friendship.  Roosevelt Administration  Through his work on the presidential campaign of New York Governor Al Smith in 1928, Niles met Harry Hopkins, a vital political contact who would later become one of the chief architects of the New Deal and would bring Niles into the Roosevelt administration. Niles would serve as the Director of the American Business Census in Massachusetts (1933-1934), a consultant, director, and assistant administrator of the Works Progress Administration (1936-1939), Special Assistant to the Secretary of Commerce (1939-1940), as well as a consultant and advisor to the Office of Production Management and War Production Board before becoming a presidential advisor to Franklin Roosevelt.  Communist allegations  In 1943, Congressman Fred Bradley accused Niles of having Communist connections while involved with the Ford Hall Forum. These accusations are thought to have been largely motivated by antisemitism. More recent allegations of Communist connections to Niles have arisen: A Venona decrypted message from New York to Moscow reported on a plan to send a husband and wife team of NKVD 'illegals' to Mexico. The message reads: > Through CAPITAN'S (Roosevelt‚Äôs) advisor David Niles ‚Äìwill take 3-4 days, > will cost 500 dollars.... [A]round Niles there is a group of his friends who > will arrange anything for a bribe. Through them TENOR (Michael W. Burd) > obtains priorities and has already paid them as much as 6000 dollars. > Whether NILES takes a bribe himself is not known for certain. Burd was a Soviet agent and an officer of the Midland Export Corporation in New York City.  Niles and Israel  Following Roosevelt's death, Niles remained as an advisor to President Harry Truman. Niles was a Zionist and was important in providing access to the White House for American Zionists. Niles' efforts on behalf of Jewish statehood earned him the support and praise of such figures as Chaim Weizmann and Moshe Sharett. In 1947, President Truman awarded him the Medal for Merit. Death Niles never married, and died in Boston on 28 September 1952, two months shy of his 64th birthday.

Life and academic career Stampacchia was born in Naples, Italy from Emanuele Stampacchia and Giulia Campagnano. He obtained his high school certification from the Liceo-Ginnasio Giambattista Vico in Naples in classical subjects, although he showed stronger aptitude for mathematics and physics. In 1940 he was admitted to the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa for undergraduate studies in pure mathematics. He was drafted in March 1943 but nevertheless managed to take examinations during the summer before joining the resistance movement against the Germans in the defense of Rome in September. He was discharged in June 1945. In 1944 he won a scholarship to the University of Naples which allowed him to continue his studies. In the 1945‚Äì1946 academic year he declined a specialization at the Scuola Normale in the Faculty of Sciences in favour of an assistant position at the Istituto Universitario Navale.According to , he was assistant professor to the chair of mathematical analysis for the academic years 1946/47 and 1947/48. In 1949 he was appointed as assistant with tenure to the chair of mathematical analysis, and in 1951 he obtained his \\"Libera docenza\\".The \\"free professorship\\" (in a literal free English translation) was an academic title similar to the German \\"Habilitation\\", no longer in force in Italy since 1970. In 1952 won a national competition for the chair at the University of Palermo. He was nominated Professor on Probation at the University of Genoa later the same year and was promoted to full Professor in 1955. He married fellow student Sara Naldini in October 1948. Children Mauro, Renata, Giulia, and Franca were born in 1949, 1951, 1955 and 1956 respectively. Stampacchia was active in research and teaching throughout his career. He made key contributions to a number of fields, including calculus of variation, variational inequalities and differential equations. In 1967 Stampacchia was elected President of the Unione Matematica Italiana. It was about this time that his research efforts shifted toward the emerging field of variational inequalities, which he modeled after boundary value problems for partial differential equations.Guido Stampacchia on The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive He was also director of the Istituto per le Applicazioni del Calcolo of Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche from December 1968Silvia Mazzone, Guido Stampacchia to 1974. Stampacchia accepted the position of Professor Mathematical Analysis at the University of Rome in 1968 and returned to Pisa in 1970. He suffered a serious heart attack in early 1978 and died of heart arrest on 27 April that year. The Stampacchia Medal, an international prize awarded every three years for contributions to the Calculus of Variations, has been established in 2003.

While visiting the latter in February 1970, he was interviewed on a Rhodesian Broadcasting Corporation television program, during which he controversially described Australia as \\"almost a Communist state\\" and praised Rhodesia as \\"much more advanced in some ways than we are\\". Prime Minister John Gorton subsequently stated that the government had no intentions of relaxing sanctions on Rhodesia.

The road has a eastern extension designated County Road 614 (CR 614). Indrio Road's current western terminus is an interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95 or SR 9); its current eastern terminus is an intersection with Kings Highway (SR 713). Indrio Road actually terminates just east of U.S. Route 1 (US 1) at Old Dixie Highway (CR 605). Most of the road passes through orange groves and pastureland. History Over the years, different parts of Indrio Road had different state road designations. A 1960 map prepared by State Road Department (forerunner of the Florida Department of Transportation) showed Indrio Road between Emerson Road (present SR 607) and US 1 as State Road 607‚Äîat the same time the designation as also applied to Emerson Road and Kings Highway (current SR 713). By the end of the decade, Kings Highway was renumbered SR 713, but Indrio Road remained SR 607 until the 1970s, when the portion west of Kings Highway became SR 614 (which was later extended to Interstate 95 upon the opening of an I-95 interchange with Indrio Road). When SR 614 was extended westward, the section east of SR 713 was redesignated State Road 617 despite its east-west alignment. Eventually, SR 617 gave way to County Road 614 as FDOT returned the route to county maintenance and control. The importance of SR 614 was at its height in the time in which I-95 had an \\"interruption\\" and motorists traveling between Florida's Turnpike and I-95 used Kings Highway and Indrio Road to \\"bridge\\" the connection between the two major expressways. As sections of I-95 were completed between Osceola Boulevard (SR 60) near Vero Beach and Okeechobee Road (SR 70) in Fort Pierce from 1978 to 1980, the common methodology of using SR 713 to travel between I-95 and the Turnpike evolved: ‚Ä¢ Until early 1978, northbound motorists turned west onto Indrio Road (SR 614) and north onto Emerson Avenue (SR 607) one mile (1.6 km) to the west. After of Emerson Avenue, northbound motorists turned west onto SR 60, which connected with I-95 six miles (10 km) from SR 607. ‚Ä¢ When a nine-mile (14 km)-long section of I-95 opened in 1978, northbound motorists stayed on Indrio Road (SR 614) after turning left from Kings Highway (SR 713). The then-new I-95 interchange was three miles (5 km) to the west of SR 713 on Indrio Road. ‚Ä¢ When an additional six miles (10 km) of I-95 were opened in late 1978, motorists were directed eastward on Orange Avenue (SR 68) from SR 713 to connect with I-95. Most stayed with this route after a two-mile (3 km)-long section (to SR 70) was opened in early 1979, even though Florida Department of Transportation posted signs encouraging them to avoid SR 713 altogether and use SR 70. The final segment of I-95 to be finished in Florida (Stuart to Palm Beach Gardens) was finally opened in 1987.

It replaced the country's first constitution which was approved in 1948. The constitution consists of seven chapters and 69 articles and codifies North Korea's basic principles on politics, economy, culture and national defense, the basic rights and duties of the country's citizens, the organization of the North Korean government and the country's national symbols. North Korea is also governed by the Ten Principles for the Establishment of a Monolithic Ideological System, which some claim have come to supersede the constitution and in practice serve as the supreme law of the country.Green, Christopher. \\"Wrapped in a Fog: On the North Korean Constitution and the Ten Principles,\\" Sino-NK, June 5, 2012. Retrieved January 3, 2016.  History  = 1948 Constitution = North Korea began to draft its first constitution following the convention of the South Korean Interim Legislative Assembly on 12 December 1946 which began to draft an interim constitution for South Korea and the failure to establish a unified provisional government in Korea due to the collapse of the US-Soviet Joint Commission on 21 October 1947. In November 1947, the People's Assembly of North Korea organized a 31-member committee to enact a provisional constitution. A draft provisional constitution was presented to the People's Assembly of North Korea in February 1948, and it was decided to submit it to an \\"all-people discussion\\" that was held from 11 February until 25 April 1948. On 10 July 1948, the People's Assembly of North Korea adopted the draft constitution as the Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which was implemented by the Supreme People's Assembly throughout the Korean peninsula on 8 September 1948. According to Andrei Lankov, the 1948 constitution was personally edited by Joseph Stalin alongside Terentii Shtykov, the head of the Soviet occupation of North Korea, in Moscow, with some of its articles being rewritten later by Soviet supervisors.\\"Terenti Shtykov: the other ruler of nascent North Korea\\" by Andrei Lankov. \\"...even the North Korean constitution was edited by Stalin himself and became law of the land only after a lengthy discussion in Moscow, where Shytkov and Stalin sat together looking through the draft of the country‚Äôs future supreme law. They approved it, but not completely, since some articles were rewritten by Soviet supervisors. So Shytkov, together with Stalin himself, can be seen as the authors of the North Korean constitution.\\" Korea Times The 1948 constitution consisted of 10 chapters and 104 articles. It codified the reforms being implemented in North Korea since the establishment the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea in 1946, such as land reforms, the nationalization of industries and resources, and the provision of various freedoms and rights to Koreans. The constitution instituted the Supreme People's Assembly as the highest government institution in North Korea with various powers such as the passing of laws and the election of the Cabinet, the Supreme Court and the Procurator General. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly was tasked with exercising the powers of the assembly during its recess, as well as to represent the country in its foreign relations. The Cabinet was instituted to be the highest executive institution, with its Premier being designated as head of government. The 1948 constitution was amended five times in April 1954, October 1954, 1955, 1956 and 1962. = Socialist Constitution = North Korea began drafting the present Socialist Constitution as there was a need to set into law the expanding socialist policies and the political, economic and social changes in the country, which are no longer being reflected in the 1948 constitution. The need for a new constitution had been discussed since the mid-1960s. In the 1970s, the creation of a new constitution was made into an urgent matter. On 23 October 1972, a committee to draft the Socialist Constitution was organized during the 5th plenary meeting of the 5th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. Kim Il-sung said in a report during the meeting that there was a need to codify the \\"socialist revolution and construction\\" and their achievements in the constitution. The draft constitution was presented to the 1st session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly, where Kim Il-sung remarked in a speech during the session on 25 December 1972 that \\"our realities today urgently demand the establishment of a new socialist constitution legally to consolidate the great achievements of our people in the socialist revolution and building of socialism and lay down principles for the political, economic, and cultural spheres in socialist society.\\" The Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was adopted at the 1st session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly on 27 December 1972, the same date that South Korea enacted the Yushin Constitution, a similarly autocratic document providing legal endorsement for a pre-existing dictatorship. The original version of the Socialist Constitution stated that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is an \\"independent socialist state\\" guided by the Juche idea of the Workers' Party of Korea, which was described as \\"a creative application of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism\\" to the situation in North Korea, and based on the socialist relations of production and the independent economy. It codified the Chongsanri spirit and method as the country's basis for all its activities and the Chollima movement as the central line of socialist construction. It establishes the North Korean economy as a planned economy that had achieved industrialisation and is being managed through the Taean work system. North Korea is said by this constitution to be developing a \\"socialist national culture\\" that trains people to become builders of socialism and communism. The constitution established a new government system for North Korea where the President is the head of state, the supreme commander of the entire armed forces, the chairman of the National Defense Commission and the head of the Central People's Committee - the new highest leadership institution established by the constitution with a wide-range of powers on domestic policy. The Supreme People's Assembly still remains to be the highest government institution with the power to pass laws and to elect the President, the members of the Central People's Committee, the members of the Administration Council, the president of the Central Court and the prosecutor general of the Central Public Prosecutors Office. The Standing Committee of the Supreme People's Assembly had its powers reduced to merely exercising the powers of the Supreme People's Assembly during its recess. The Cabinet was replaced by the Administration Council which is headed by the Premier and is tasked with implementing state policy. The Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has been amended eight times in 1992, 1998, 2009, 2010, 2012, 2013, 2016 and 2019.

Amendments to the North Korean constitution are usually considered as an entirely new constitution due to the extent of the changes made to the original document. = 1992 amendment = The Socialist Constitution of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was first amended at the 3rd session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly on 9 April 1992. The amendment solidified Kim Jong-il's position as the successor to Kim Il-sung by making the National Defence Commission a separate institution from the Central People's Committee. It also no longer made the President the supreme commander of the armed forces and the chairman of the National Defense Commission. This made the chairman of the National Defense Commission the highest military authority. These provisions allowed for Kim Jong-il to assume the positions of supreme commander of the Korean People's Army on 24 December 1991 and chairman of the National Defense Commission on 9 April 1993. The amendment's introduction was also a response to the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe and the dissolution of the Soviet Union. It removed mentions of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism in the constitution, and constitutionalized the philosophical principle of Juche with the Workers' Party of Korea being stated to have a leading role in the country's activities.

It also abolished the office of the President and the Central People's Committee with the President's powers as head of state being transferred to the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly (with the President of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly being designated as head of state) while the President's powers on state administration being transferred to the Cabinet.

The preamble was revised to include Kim Jong-il, who was credited with defending Kim Il-sung's policies and turned North Korea into a politico-ideological power, a nuclear state and a military power through Songun politics. It enshrined Kim Jong-il as the eternal Chairman of the National Defense Commission and also recognized that his ideas and achievements were also the basis for the constitution which is now known as the Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il Constitution.

The district stretches from the small town of Mangakino in the northwest to the Tongariro National Park in the south, and east into the Kaingaroa Forest. The district's population is largely located in the two main centres, Taup≈ç and Turangi. Local government The district is governed by the Taupo District Council, with the vast majority of the district falling within the jurisdiction of Waikato Regional Council. History Little is known about early MƒÅori settlement near Taup≈ç, although NgƒÅti T≈´wharetoa have been the main iwi of the area for several hundred years. Major pa were situated at the southern end of the lake to the west of the modern town of Turangi. Taupo town was founded in 1869 as a garrison town during the New Zealand Wars, but remained small due to the poor volcanic soils of the region. It was not until the 1950s that the region started to develop, with forestry and the construction of the Wairakei geothermal power station. Population The town of Taup≈ç is situated on the north-eastern shore of the lake, and T≈´rangi is at the lake's southern extremity. State Highway 1 winds along the eastern shore of Lake Taupo, and several small townships are located along it.

The location of the original Weber High School was between 11th and 12th Street on the east side of Washington Boulevard in Ogden (the site of a current Shopko store and disco). In 1926, Weber County voters approved a bond for a county high school by a vote of 733 to 480. Construction of the building began in 1926 and was completed in 1927. Educators held school in the building in the fall of 1926, although the school was still under construction. In 1953-54 the school expanded with the addition of a new south wing.Sadler, Richard W and Richard C. Roberts. Weber County's History.Ogden, Utah: Weber County Commission, 2000, p.200. When the current campus opened in Pleasant View, the old building remained, until demolished in the mid-1980s. The current location of Weber High was established and opened in 1972 with an addition to the building in 1984. In the fall of 1994, the student population was split and half of the students went to the newly build Fremont High School. Their primary rivals are the Silver Wolves of Fremont High School, due to the close proximity of the two schools and the splitting of Weber in 1994 to build Fremont.

It serves as a north‚Äìsouth connector between NY 31 in the hamlet of Fancher and NY 104 (Ridge Road) midway between the hamlets of East Gaines and Murray. In between, NY 387 crosses the Erie Canal and passes through the community of Brockville. The route was assigned to its current alignment as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. Route description NY 387 southbound in Murray NY 387 begins at a T-intersection with NY 31 in Fancher, a small hamlet located on the Falls Road Railroad in the town of Murray. While NY 31 heads south and west from the junction, NY 387 heads to the north on Fancher Road, crossing the Falls Road Railroad and passing by a small pocket of homes before exiting the hamlet and entering an open, rural area. About from Fancher, the route crosses over the Erie Canal just south of another hamlet known as Brockville. NY 387 runs north‚Äìsouth through the community and across the west branch of Sandy Creek into another undeveloped area, where NY 387 quietly ends later at an isolated junction with NY 104 (Ridge Road). History The highway that is now NY 387 became a state highway on May 1, 1917, when the state of New York assumed ownership of the road following the completion of a $44,848.35 project (equivalent to $ in ) to bring the highway up to state highway standards. It was subsequently designated, but not signed, as State Highway 580 (SH 580). The road served as a north‚Äìsouth connector between two major east‚Äìwest highways: the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway (now NY 31) to the south and Ridge Road (NY 104) to the north. While both of those roads had posted route numbers as early as 1926, SH 580 was not assigned a posted number until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was designated as NY 387.

Drumheller was born in Biloxi, Mississippi. Drumheller claimed the CIA had credible sources discounting some weapon of mass destruction (WMD) claims made during the Iraq disarmament crisis before the 2003 Invasion of Iraq. He received and discounted documents central to the Niger yellowcake forgery prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He has also stated that senior White House officials dismissed intelligence information from his agency which reported Saddam Hussein had no WMD program. According to Drumheller the Bush administration ignored CIA advice and used whatever information it could find to justify an invasion of Iraq. The CIA, brokered by the French intelligence service, recruited Iraqi Foreign Minister Naji Sabri in Europe during the late summer of 2002. Sabri told the CIA in September that Saddam had no major active weapons of mass destruction programs; they had no fissile material and biological weapons were almost non-existent, although he claimed that there were chemical weapons. This information was then transmitted to the White House, but it was ignored in favor of the information acquired by Germany's intelligence service Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND) coming from a source known as Curveball. On September 6, 2007, Sidney Blumenthal, reporting at Salon.com, supported Drumheller's account: \\"Now two former senior CIA officers have confirmed Drumheller's account to me and provided the background to the story of how the information that might have stopped the invasion of Iraq was twisted in order to justify it.\\" In March 2011, Blumenthal sent an email which included \\"apparently highly sensitive information\\" to then U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton with details received from Drumheller, who had spoken with a CIA colleague, mentioning the name of an intelligence source. Drumheller retired from the CIA in 2005 after a 26-year career, where he spent more than 25 years as an intelligence operative. He died on August 2, 2015, from pancreatic cancer at the age of 63 in Falls Church, Virginia. See also William D.

At Nuovo Vesuvio, Tony and Phil celebrate the induction of Gerry and Burt Gervasi into their respective crime families. There are mutters about the deteriorating quality of the restaurant. Tony has a meal at Da Giovanni, a highly successful rival restaurant to Nuovo Vesuvio. Artie is facing problems at his restaurant: it is losing money and there are tensions with Benny, who is flirting with the new Albanian hostess, Martina. While nursing a drink at the Bada Bing, Artie confronts Tony about dining at Da Giovanni; Tony makes excuses. When he offers some tips to increase the restaurant's popularity, Artie angrily rebuffs him and suggests he settle his outstanding tab if he wants to help. Later, Artie rejects his wife Charmaine's suggestions to stop bothering his guests with table-side visits. Fraud investigators for American Express come to the restaurant. Someone has been stealing credit card numbers from Artie's customers, and the restaurant's card usage has to be suspended. Artie learns Martina helped Benny steal the numbers and fires her. Furious, Artie goes to Benny's house in the middle of the night and they get into a fistfight. Artie leaves Benny bleeding on his porch. Tony meets separately with the two men and compels them to make peace. At Tony's insistence, Benny's parents have their anniversary dinner at Nuovo Vesuvio. Artie visits them during their meal. In front of his pregnant wife, Artie offers Benny a \\"martina\\", explaining that it is an Albanian martini. Benny follows Artie into the kitchen and forces his right hand into a boiling pot of tomato sauce, badly burning him. Christopher asks Tony's permission to fly to Los Angeles with Little Carmine to cast actors for Cleaver, and Tony reluctantly consents. While he is away, Murmur makes rounds for Chris; they include delivering card numbers to Ahmed and Muhammad, who are stealing money via the Internet. Benny takes over Chris' credit card operation, giving a cut to Tony. In Los Angeles, Chris and Little Carmine have a scheduled meeting with Ben Kingsley. He is not interested in Cleaver and interrupts Chris and Carmine to speak to Lauren Bacall, who is to be a presenter at an awards show. Chris and Carmine then tag along with him, and Chris is astounded by the great quantity of free expensive luxury items Kingsley is offered. Chris later phones him, asking him to arrange for Chris himself to enter their hotel's Luxury Lounge, but he says he cannot. Kingsley turns down Cleaver. Murmur comes to L.A., as requested by Chris, and finds him intoxicated in his hotel room. Once he sobers up, the two find Kingsley in an elevator and try to subtly intimidate/convince him to gain access into the Luxury Lounge. Kingsley blurts out that award presenters get free goods worth around $30,000. Outside the awards show Chris, masked, mugs Bacall, stealing her gift bag. At home, Chris offers Tony some of the stolen goods, but Tony is more concerned with Chris' lack of focus, blaming his absence for the feud between Artie and Benny.

For students who entered Grade 9 in 1999‚Äì2000, successful completion of the test was not a graduation requirement. However, for those students who took the field test of the OSSLT in 2000‚Äì2001, failed the test, and chose to retake the OSSLT in October 2001, successful completion of the provincial literacy graduation requirement became a diploma requirement. It is administered by the Education Quality and Accountability Office (EQAO). The OSSLT is written every year in March or April in order to assess students' reading and writing skills. The test is taken by all of the province's public secularized and separate secondary schools, and private secondary schools in Ontario. The test is either administered in either English or French, dependent on whether or not the student is enrolled in a anglophone, or francophone school system. Layout The OSSLT consists of two booklets that must be completed by students in two and a half hours. The first booklet includes multiple-choice and short answer questions, as well as a question asking the student to compose a newspaper article based on the headline and picture provided. The second booklet also includes multiple- choice and short answer questions, as well as a question asking the student to write an opinion piece on a given topic (series of paragraph). The test is out of 400 marks. =Reading component= Students are asked to read a variety of selections and answer questions about each of them. The questions asked are designed to measure students understanding of ideas and information that are directly or indirectly stated in the text. Students are also expected to make personal connections related to the reading selections. The selections used in the OSSLT consist of common reading materials, including information materials (e.g. instructions, newspaper articles), graphic materials (e.g. graphs, diagrams, legends) and literary materials (e.g. stories). =Writing component= Students have to produce four pieces of writing for the OSSLT. The writing component is designed to measure the student's ability to develop a main idea, provide supporting details, organize and link ideas and information, use a tone for the particular type of writing and use correct spelling and grammar. Examples of pieces requested in the OSSLT include summaries, opinion pieces, news reports and information paragraphs.Preparing Students for the OSSLT > Ministry of Education Marks may be deducted due to a lack of detail. However, the inclusion of too much information can also result in penalties. Preparation Preparation for the test ranges from \\"Literacy Monday\\" activities in Grade 10 classes every Monday from the start of the school year. Some schools offer part-time after school practice courses to entire semester long courses that occupy a whole \\"period\\" each school day (OSSLC), although this is only targeted at struggling students or students who have failed in the past. Reports have circulated by disgruntled parents that their teen who attends the local secondary school was never informed of the OSSLT's existence and thus was never prepared for the tests. This problem is mostly limited to under performing schools mostly in inner city areas. Procedure Before the OSSLT is written, teachers are expected to assist students in preparation for the test. Upon completion of the test, booklets are shipped for marking. Those who fail must attempt the test the following year or take the Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course (OLC 4O) in grade 12 to meet the literacy requirement. Alternatives =Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course= The Ontario Secondary School Literacy Course (OSSLC, Course Code: OLC3O/OLC4O) is a Grade 11 or 12 Open course that can be taken by those who had written the OSSLT more than once. It is designed to assist students in acquiring basic literacy skills required for getting an Ontario high school diploma. In the course, students will have to read a variety of text (e.g. narrative text) and produce different types of writing (e.g. news reports). Accommodations can be made for students with an IEP (Individual Education Plan) so as to strengthen those students' language skills. The OSSLC can serve as one of at least four first language credits necessary for graduating high school, as well as a replacement for the OSSLT. =Adjudication process= Adjudication panels may be established at the end of the school year by school boards to provide certain students with an additional opportunity to meet the Ontario literacy requirement. Those who qualify for adjudication include students who were unable to write the OSSLT and/or enroll in or complete the OSSLC due to unforeseen circumstances, as well as students who have an IEP documenting required accommodations but, because of unforeseen circumstances, did not have access to these accommodations when taking the OSSLT.  Criticism  The failed implementation of an online form of the OSSLT by Kathleen Wynne's Liberal government was criticized by NDP MP Lisa Gretzky on October 25, 2016.

Savage (born November 14, 1951) is a political science professor at the University of Virginia and teaches public policy in the Department of Politics and at the Frank Batten School of Leadership and Public Policy. He is an expert in government budget and fiscal policies and budget theory. He completed his undergraduate degrees in political science and psychology at the University of California, Riverside, his graduate degrees in political science, public policy, and economics at the University of California, Berkeley, and his post-doctoral fellowship at Harvard University. At Berkeley, Savage studied under Nelson Polsby and Aaron Wildavsky. In 2013, Savage received the Aaron B. Wildavsky Award for Lifetime Scholarly Achievement in budgeting and public financial management from the Association for Budgeting and Financial Management, and in 2014 he was elected as a Fellow of the National Academy of Public Administration. Savage is best known for four books on American and comparative budgeting and fiscal policy: Balanced Budgets and American Politics (Cornell University Press); Funding Science in America: Congress, Universities and the Politics of the Academic Porkbarrel (Cambridge University Press); Making the EMU: The Politics of Budgetary Surveillance and the Enforcement of Maastricht (Oxford University Press); and Reconstructing Iraq's Budgetary Institutions: Coalition State Building after Saddam (Cambridge University Press). The first book explores the origins of the idea of balancing budgets and its effect on American politics, fiscal policies, and institutional development from 1690 through the Reagan presidency. The book argues that the idea of balancing the budget is fundamentally rooted in American political thought that can be tied, for example, to the political differences that divided the Jeffersonians and the Hamiltonians. The second book analyzes the politics of congressional earmarking in the federal budget for universities and colleges. This book explores how the idea of peer review of federal research funding is violated by universities that engage in earmarking. The third book examines how the enforcement of the Maastricht Treaty's budgetary rules played a critical role in the creation of the European Union's Economic and Monetary Union and the later enforcement of the Stability and Growth Pact. The last book argues that consistent with the literature on state building, failed states, and foreign assistance, budgeting is a core state function that is necessary for the operations of a functional government. Employing an historical institutionalist approach, the book first explores the Ottoman, British, and Ba'athist origins of Iraq's budgetary institutions. The book next examines American prewar planning, the Coalition Provisional Authority's rule making and budgeting following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the mixed success of the American-led Coalition's capacity building programs initiated throughout the occupation. The common thread connecting these books together is that budgeting and budgetary policies are deeply influenced by and reflect the contest over ideas and values.

Additionally, their music has appeared on compilations by Sasha and Dave Seaman. In April 2006, Lostep released their first full album, Because We Can on GU Music. The pair also DJ together. History According to their website, accidental discovery is a theme which underlies Lostep's musical approach. While Luke Chable and Phil K were already successful DJs and producers, the collaboration that became Lostep was not necessarily a well-planned endeavor so much as something that took place organically over a period of time. Individually, Luke and Phil had both mixed albums and released records for some of the biggest electronic music labels in the world and had both performed in some of the world‚Äôs biggest and best nightclubs. But it was through their mutual love for electronic music and the spirit of artistic collaboration that Lostep finally came to full fruition. The two initially began a loose collaboration in the studio with the support of Ivan Gough, mostly just the two having fun remixing and creating experimental new material. Eventually the duo produced their first single as a group, titled \\"The Roots,\\" featuring vocalist Lior Attar. Fellow DJ and producer Dave Seaman was enthusiastic about the track and featured it on his electronic mix compilation Global Underground 22: Dave Seaman in Melbourne, which was released in 2002. The duo's next single \\"Burma\\" was another organic collaboration composed once again in Phil's loungeroom studio. The two sent the completed track to friend and fellow producer Sasha, who later included it in his CD compilation album, Involver, which was released in 2004. Several years later, after months of on-again, off-again collaboration in the studio, Lostep released their first album, Because We Can, which quickly received widespread acclaim in the electronic music scene. The album has been described as a ‚Äúdreamlike sequence,‚Äù rather than a typical mix album, and the musical style could fall under a variety of categories, including Breakbeat, IDM (Intelligent Dance Music), Deep House and experimental.http://dancemusic.about.com/od/reviews/fr/LostepBWC.htm Discography Studio Albums 2006: Because We Can (Global Music Records) Singles 2002: The Roots (feat.

Lack of occupancy, in this sense, is a \\"vacancy\\". Building codes It is possible to have multiple occupancies (or building uses) within one building. For example, a high-rise building can have retail stores occupying the lower levels, while the upper levels are residential. Different occupancies within a building are separated by a fire barrierNFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code 2006 Edition, Chapter 6 Classification of Occupancy, Classification of Hazard of Contents, and Special Operations section 6.2.4 with a defined fire-resistance rating. It is common for a penetration (such as a fire door) to have a fire protection rating lower than the wall fire‚Äìresistance rating in which it is installed.NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code 2006 Edition, Chapter 8 Fire-Resistive Materials and Construction, Table 8.7.2 Minimum Fire Protection Ratings for Opening Protectives in Fire Resistance‚ÄìRated Assemblies For example, a two- hour fire separation normally requires fire doors rated at 90 minutes. For some high challenge occupancies,NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code 2006 Edition / Chapter 8 Fire-Resistive Materials and Construction, Table 8.7.2 Minimum Fire Protection Ratings for Opening Protectives in Fire Resistance‚ÄìRated Assemblies the code requirements for an occupancy separation are more stringent than for other fire barriers, even with an identical fire resistance rating. In this case, an occupancy separation with a two-hour fire- resistance rating may not be able to \\"de-rate\\" its closures, such fire doors and firestops. For example, a two-hour rated \\"high challenge fire wall\\"NFPA 5000 Building Construction and Safety Code 2006 Edition, section 8.3 requires two-hour rated fire doors. Firestops in occupancy separations are also more likely to require an equal fire protection rating (a fire resistance rating for closures). They also must provide a temperature rating ensuring that the components of the firestop systems, including the penetrants are not permitted to rise in temperature above 140¬∞C (284¬∞F) on average or 180¬∞C (356¬∞F) at any single point, to lower the likelihood of auto-ignition on the unexposed side. In this manner, occupancy separations are treated similarly to fire walls which are structurally stable in case of a fire, thus limiting the danger of fire-induced building collapse. In this sense, there are two occupancies in many single-family homes: the garage and the living space of the home. Because automobile gasoline is flammable, an occupancy separation is often required between the two should there be a vehicle fire. Water heaters and central heating are often placed in this space as well for their use of natural gas, propane, or other fossil fuels in combustion. This also helps to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. Building utilization The interior of a vacant building showing signs of vandalism and decay Occupancy can also refer to the number of units in use, such as hotel rooms, apartment flats, or offices. When a motel is at full occupancy, it is common practice to turn on a NO VACANCY neon sign. Completely vacant buildings can also attract crime. A 2017 study found that demolishing vacant buildings \\"reduce crime by about 8 percent on the block group in question and 5 percent on nearby block groups\\". Occupancy can also refer to the number of persons using an undivided space, such as a meeting room, ballroom, auditorium, or stadium. As with building codes, fire protection authorities often set a limit on the number of people that can occupy a space at one time. These limits are established primarily to allow all occupants safe passage through exits, but can also be employed to preserve the integrity of a structure. An occupancy sensor is a device that can tell if someone is in a room, and is often used in home automation and security systems. These are typically more advanced than motion sensors, which can only detect motion. Other meanings In transport engineering, occupancy can refer to: #The number of passengers occupying a vehicle #The percentage of time in which a detector is occupied by a vehicle #The average number of particles occupying a state In football, occupancy can refer to: #A team that does not currently have a manager, a president, or a home stadium See also *Building code *Construction *Fire protection *Fire-resistance rating *Fireproofing *Firestop *List of human habitation forms *Passive fire protection *Penetrant References Category:Fire protection ","title":"Occupancy"},{"id":"4872997","text":"Gary Moorcroft (born 16 April 1976) is a former Australian rules football player for Essendon and Melbourne in the Australian Football League (AFL). Moorcroft caught the attention of talent scouts with his winning of the Morrish Medal in 1994 whilst playing for the Northern Knights. Moorcroft was a short, stocky and explosive goalsneak who participated in a premiership with Essendon in 2000 and a Grand Final side against the Brisbane Lions in 2001. He was delisted by Essendon in 2002 after playing 95 games and struggling to retain his spot in a talented side. It was the Demons, who Essendon beat in the 2000 final in which Moorcroft was an outstanding player, who picked him up in the draft. Moorcroft played in three losing games with the Demons and suffered a severe season-ending knee injury after a lacklustre debut. This effectively brought an end to his chances of working his way back into the side, and he was almost immediately delisted. The then-27-year-old's 98-game, nine-year AFL career ended there. Moorcroft is best known for winning the 2001 Mark of the Year, with a spectacular high-flying mark in Round 14, 2001, against the Western Bulldogs, taking the mark over Bulldogs' forward Brad Johnson. The mark was particularly notable in that Moorcroft first jumped onto Johnson's back and then leapt higher into the air by leveraging himself off Johnson; this is very rare, as players will usually jump onto their opponent's back and then appear to hang at the same height while taking the mark (hence the colloquial term hanger for such a mark). For a similar reason, Johnson is often referred to as the springboard for this mark, while the term stepladder is used for the player underneath a hanger. Moorcroft spent a season at Bendigo Bombers in the VFL before retiring from AFL/VFL and moving into the local leagues. In 2005, Moorcroft joined the Silvan F.C. in the Yarra Valley Mountain Football League. During his time at Silvan, Moorcroft won four club best-and-fairest awards and broke the 100-goal mark twice, including topping the goalkicking tables of all leagues with 163 goals in 2008. In fact, this season was so dominant for Moorcroft that he had registered his 100th goal during Round 11! Of his three grand finals at Silvan, two of these were back- to-back premierships in 2007/08. In 2009/10, Moorcroft was playing for the Romsey Redbacks in the Riddell District Football League (RDFL). In 2011, Moorcroft joined Bundoora in the Northern Football League (NFL) and has played in three premierships with the Bulls (2011, 2013 & 2017). As a 41-year-old, he kicked the winning goal in the 2017 Grand Final. At the completion of the 2019 season, while still playing at high level at Bundoora, and at 43 years old, Moorcroft announced his retirement from senior footy for good.

In that race he originally finished second by the smallest margin ever to decide an Olympic swimming final (one hundredth of a second), but was later awarded the gold medal after the victor, American Rick DeMont, an asthmatic, was disqualified when his urine alysis tested positive for traces of the banned stimulant ephedrine. The second of three brothers, Cooper was born in Singapore to Australian parents but moved with his family to Rockhampton, Queensland at the age of five. There, his father was the manager of a cinema centre and the family also water skied on weekends. The Cooper brothers all learned to swim early and joined the Rockhampton Swimming Club, but it was Brad who shone from the start, winning his first Central Queensland medals at age seven. After his parents divorced when he was twelve, Cooper lived with his father while his brothers stayed with their mother. For the next three years his father entered an unsettled phase, during which time he and Brad lived in a dozen men's boarding houses and hostels in Brisbane and Sydney. This disrupted his education and coaching: he would attend fifteen schools and train under ten coaches, briefly including John Konrads, himself a prolific world-record breaking swimmer and Olympic gold medallist. In 1970, at age 15, at the national open championships, Cooper came second in both the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, putting him briefly in contention for that year's Commonwealth Games team. Cooper then moved to Sydney, where he trained with Don Talbot. This paid dividends at the 1971 Australian Championships, when he won both the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, the latter in an Australian record time. He also came second in the 400 m freestyle behind fellow Talbot swimmer Graham Windeatt, surpassing the previous Australian record. This earned Cooper selection for a national team to tour Europe for competitive experience. In January 1972, Cooper hit the headlines when he broke the 800 m freestyle world record. Within a month, at the Australian Championships in Brisbane, he won the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle events and the 100 m and 200 m backstroke, showing versatility over a large range of distances. This included a world record in the 400 m freestyle, while his 1500 m freestyle time was only 0.6s outside the world record. He went to Munich as one of the favourites in both the 400 m and 1500 m freestyle events. In the 400 m event, Cooper contested the race with DeMont and West Germany's Werner Lampe who attacked immediately. In the end Lampe faded, and DeMont touched just 0.01s ahead of Cooper. Both then easily qualified for the 1500 m freestyle final, but news came through afterwards that DeMont had been disqualified from the 400 m and barred from starting in the 1500 m final, due to a positive test for ephedrine after American officials had forgotten to register his asthma drug Marax. The International Olympic Committee initially decided to leave the gold medal vacant, until a protest from the Australian delegation resulted in Cooper being awarded the gold medal. The controversy appeared to affect Cooper in the 1500 m freestyle final. He finished seventh, twenty seconds slower than his time in the heats, and more than half a minute slower than his personal best. His performance in the 200 m backstroke placed him fourth, after lowering his personal best by three seconds, although it was two seconds slower than the bronze medal winner. He also placed fifth in the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay with Windeatt, Michael Wenden and Robert Nay. After the Olympics, Talbot left to become a coach in Canada, forcing Cooper to return to Brisbane to train with Harry Gallagher. In 1973, he was the Australian Champion in the 200 m, 400 m and 800 m freestyle, and the 100 m and 200 m backstroke. However, he continued to switch coaches throughout the year, also training with Allan Wood and Tony Fraser. He went on to compete at the 1973 World Aquatics Championships in Belgrade, where media interest surrounded his 400 m and 1500 m freestyle races against DeMont. In the 400 m, both broke the world record and broke the four- minute barrier for the first time, with DeMont finishing ahead of Cooper. Cooper also finished behind DeMont in the 1500 m, but the race was won by Australian Stephen Holland, who broke his own world record. Cooper also won a silver medal as part of the 4 √ó 200 m freestyle relay. Cooper was then awarded a swimming scholarship to Miami University, but was unable to enrol as he had not finished his secondary education in Australia. At the 1974 Commonwealth Games in Christchurch, he was upset in the 100 m backstroke by fellow Australian Mark Tonelli and finished third, but set a new Australian record in the 200 m backstroke to win gold. In the freestyle events, he managed a silver in the 400 m, three seconds outside his best, and finished last in the 1500 m freestyle, one minute slower than his best. He then won the 400 m freestyle and 200 m backstroke at the Australian Championships, and then retired, saying that \\"I was sick of the daily grind\\". Cooper later worked in periods in the newspaper industry as a journalist, as well as becoming a swimming coach and building his own swim centre. He was inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1990, and the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1994.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, Brad Cooper (AUS) . Retrieved 15 March 2015. He received an Australian Sports Medal in 2000. In 2009 Cooper was inducted into the Queensland Sport Hall of Fame.

He graduated in 1934 with a dissertation on Gustav Mahler but refused a degree in protest of his ordinarius (=professor) Gustav Becking who was a Nazi supporter. He married Gerti (Gertrude) Hermann (d. 1972), a niece of Franz Kafka and the family fled Nazi Germany in 1934. His father died when the family reached the Czech border. He moved to India and worked as a director of music at the All India Radio in Bombay from 1937 to 1946. His contemporary John Foulds, known for banning the harmonium from Indian radio, worked in New Delhi. He founded the Bombay Chamber Music Society along with others like Mehli Mehta (Kaufmann also taught the Mehli's son Zubin Mehta). He also researched Indian and Asian music, writing about them in journals. He composed the signature tune for All India Radio in 1936. During World War II he served in the British Navy and after the war he tried to return to Prague but settled in London and composed music for J. Arthur Rank Films in England from 1947 to 48. He then moved to Canada and taught at Halifax. On the recommendation of Sir Ernest MacMillan he became a conductor for the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra from 1948 to 1956. He married the pianist Freda Trepel in 1950. After moving to the United States, he served as a professor of musicology at Indiana University from 1957 until his death in 1984 in Bloomington.Memorial Resolution.

The type and only species is N. leali. Discovery and naming Left maxilla In the mid-seventies, a fragmentary small theropod skeleton was discovered by Jaime Eduardo Powell and Jos√© Fernando Bonaparte at the Estancia El Brete-site. In 1977, the discovery was reported in the scientific literature.Bonaparte, J.F., Salfitty, J.A., Bossi, G., Powell, J.E. 1977. \\"Hallazgos de dinosaurios y aves cret√°cicas en la Formaci√≥n Lecho de El Brete (Salta), pr√≥ximo al l√≠mite con Tucum√°n\\". Acta Geol√≥gica Lilloana 14: 19-28 The type species, Noasaurus leali, was named and described by Bonaparte and Powell in 1980. The generic name begins with a usual abbreviation of noroeste Argentina, \\"northwest Argentina\\". The specific name honours the owner of the site, Fidel Leal.J. F. Bonaparte and J. E. Powell. 1980. \\"A continental assemblage of tetrapods from the Upper Cretaceous beds of El Brete, northwestern Argentina (Sauropoda-Coelurosauria-Carnosauria-Aves)\\". M√©moires de la Soci√©t√© G√©ologique de France, Nouvelle S√©rie 139: 19-28 The holotype, PVL 4061, was found in a layer of the Lecho Formation of Salta Province, Argentina, dating from the late Cretaceous period, more precisely the early Maastrichtian stage, about seventy million years ago. It consists of a partial skeleton with skull. It contains the maxilla, the quadrate bone, two neck vertebrae, two neck ribs, the centrum of a back vertebra, two hand claws, a finger phalanx and the second right metatarsal bone. One of the hand claws was initially identified as a second toe claw. In 2004, it was recognised as a hand claw, at which occasion the second hand claw was referred.Agnolin, F.L., Apesteguia, S. and Chiarelli, P. 2004. \\"The end of a myth: The mysterious ungual claw of Noasaurus leali\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 24(3): 301A-302A In 1999, a neck vertebra found at the site, specimen MACM 622, was identified as oviraptorosaurian, a rare proof that the Oviraptorosauria had invaded the Gondwanan continents.Frankfurt, N.G. and Chiappe, L.M. 1999. \\"A possible oviraptorosaur from the Late Cretaceous of northwestern Argentina\\". Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology. 19(1): 101-105 In 2007 however, it was reidentified as a noasaurid vertebra, probably belonging to the Noasaurus holotype.Agnolin, F.L. and Martinelli, A.G. 2007. \\"Did oviraptorosaurs (Dinosauria; Theropoda) inhabit Argentina?\\", Cretaceous Research, 28(5): 785-790 Description Size comparison of Noasaurus to a human Noasaurus was a small theropod. Gregory S.Paul estimated its length at 1.5 meters (5 ft), its weight at 15 kg (33 lbs).Paul, G.S., 1988, Predatory Dinosaurs of the World. Simon & Schuster, New York, p 285-286 In 2016 Molina-P√©rez and Larramendi gave a higher estimation of 3 meters (9.8 ft) and 38 kg (84 lbs) with a hip height of 80 cm (2.6 ft). The maxilla bears at least eleven teeth. The teeth are recurved and have serrations at the front and rear edges. The neck is probably long as the neck vertebrae are very elongated. These vertebrae are also strongly vertically compressed with a low neural spine and bear long epipophyses, a typical abelisauroid trait. While originally reported to have a raptorial 'sickle claw' on the foot similar to the claws of the more advanced dromaeosaurids, subsequent studies showed that the claw actually came from the hand.Agnolin, F.L. and Chiarelli, P. (2010). \\"The position of the claws in Noasauridae (Dinosauria: Abelisauroidea) and its implications for abelisauroid manus evolution.\\" Pal√§ontologische Zeitschrift, published online 19 November 2009. The claw is exceptionally curved, has parallel base sides in top view, and possesses a deep triangular cavity at the base underside. Classification Noasaurus is today considered to be a member of the Ceratosauria. Originally, it was seen as a member of the Coelurosauria. Bonaparte and Powell assigned it to a family of its own, the Noasauridae. In 1988, Gregory S. Paul saw them as members of the Abelisauridae and coined a Noasaurinae within that group. He also incorrectly thought they were Megalosauria. Later, the noasaurids were recognised as close relatives of the larger abelisaurids; they are both derived from the same basal abelisauroid ancestor. The following cladogram is based on the phylogenetic analysis conducted by Rauhut and Carrano in 2016, showing the relationships of Elaphrosaurus among the noasaurids:Rauhut, O.W.M., and Carrano, M.T. (2016). The theropod dinosaur Elaphrosaurus bambergi Janensch, 1920, from the Late Jurassic of Tendaguru, Tanzania. Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society, (advance online publication) Paleobiology Reconstructed hypothetical skull based on Masiakasaurus In 1980, it was thought that the presumed foot claw functioned as a sickle claw. Paul in 1988 saw the noasaurines as the South-American counterparts of the Asian and North-American dromaeosaurids, in a process of convergent evolution. Noting that abelisaurids tend to have very short arms, he wondered whether the forelimbs of Noasaurus were of limited length also, forcing the animal to employ a kicking technique instead of grasping the back of a victim in order to disembowel it with the foot claws, a method he assumed the dromaeosaurids used.This hypothesis was undermined when it was determined that the foot claw was in fact a hand claw. In 2001, a more complete genus of noasaurid, Masiakasaurus was discovered. This genus had an unusual down-turned jaw which supposedly was an adaptation for piscivory (a diet of fish), suggesting that Noasaurus was similar in appearance and lifestyle.

She was coached by Terry Gathercole and Don Talbot. Biography The daughter of a fitter and turner who worked in the Wollongong steelworks for more than 35 years, Whitfield was taught to swim along with her sister and their cousins at the age four by her maternal uncle, who was active in the local Learn to Swim program. Along with her sister and cousins, she was a childhood member of the Shellharbour Swimming Club, and was mainly taken to local swimming competitions by her father and uncle. This became even more pronounced following the death of her mother from cancer. Whitfield showed a preference for the breaststroke from an early age, and would do a breaststroke kick when participating in freestyle activities. She showed a wider interest in sport while at Shellharbour Primary School, playing softball, netball, athletics and even playing cricket against her male classmates. However, this ended as she approached the end of her primary school years, with swimming coming to the fore. At the age of nine, Whitfield competed in the Primary School State Championships at North Sydney Pool, coming second to Kathy Whitlam, who happened to be the daughter of future Prime Minister of Australia Gough Whitlam. It was at the age of ten that Whitfield witnessed Australia's Dawn Fraser win her third consecutive 100-metre freestyle Olympic gold medal at the 1964 Summer Olympics, becoming the first Olympian to win an individual event three times consecutively, that forged her resolve to become an Olympian. At the age of 11, her uncle decided to send her to Sydney every weekend to receive training from Terry Gathercole, an Olympic medal-winning breaststroker who was regarded as Australia's foremost breaststroke coach. This involved long daytrips for her family to help her fulfill her dream, usually starting before daybreak. During school holidays, she boarded with Gathercole to train under him on a daily basis. In her first year under Gathercole, she finished third in the 100-metre breaststroke in her age group at the New South Wales Championships. Her improvement was rapid, and in 1968, she won the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke in the under-14 division at the State championships before placing second in her age group at the national titles in Hobart. This her progress to the open Australian Championships, which were the selection trials for the Olympics team. At the age of 14, she narrowly missed selection for the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City, after finishing sixth and fourth in the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke respectively in the trials. In 1969, Gathercole was appointed as a swimming coach in Midland, Texas, forcing Whitfield's father to raise funds for her to travel to Texas and board with his family to continue her training for six months, where she sharpened her racing skills with more frequent racing in the more competitive American scene. Her improvement saw her place sixth and third in the 100-metre and 200-metrebreaststroke respectively at the US Championships in Louisville, Kentucky. On her return to Australia in November 1969, Gathercole arranged for her to train under Don Talbot. Whitfield found Talbot to be a hard-pushing coach: \\"I both hated and loved him. Terry Gathercole and Don Talbot had two different approaches. With Don I had to do all the strokes, the same number of repetitions and the same as everyone else was doing. I was exhausted.\\" Whitfield proceeded to win both breaststroke titles at the 1970 Australian Championships in times of 1 m 18.5 s and 2 m 48 s respectively. She then toured South Africa with the national team before repeating the victories at the 1970 Commonwealth Games in Edinburgh in times of 1 m 17.4 s and 2 m 44.2 s respectively. She relegated England's Dorothy Harrison to silver in setting new Commonwealth records in both races. She added a third gold medal in the 4√ó100-metre medley relay, combining with Lynne Watson, Alyson Mabb and Denise Langford in 4 m 30.66 s. Whitfield continued her winning run in 1971, taking out the Australian Championships in both breaststroke events, although her times were slower than in Edinburgh. A third victory came with the New South Wales team in the medley relay. She competed at the International Coca-Cola Meet at Crystal Palace in London, taking the bronze medal in the 200-metre breaststroke behind the Soviet Galina Prozumenshchikova, the world record holder. Late in 1971, Whitfields' rival Harrison came to Australia on a Churchill Fellowship and trained alongside her with Talbot. At the 1972 Australian Championships, Harrison took both the 100-metre and 200-metre breaststroke titles from Whitfield. Whitfield gradually improved her times in the lead up to the 1972 Summer Olympics during the Australian training camp in Scarborough, Queensland. Dana Schoenfield, Beverley Whitfield, and Galina Prozumenshchikova at the 1972 Olympics Coming into the Olympics, she was not regarded as a favourite, with her best times being substantially slower than other swimmers. Whitfield's best time in the 100-metre breaststroke was only 1 m 18 s, but she repeatedly lowered this throughout the competition, coming third in her heat in a time of 1 m 17.59 s to scrape into the semi-final. She then posted a time of 1 m 16.3 s, again placing third and again scraping into the final. She again substantially improved her time in the final, claiming bronze in a time of 1 m 15.73 s behind Cathy Carr of the United States. In the 200-metre breaststroke, she came second in her heat to Prozumenshchikova in a time of 2 m 44.5 s, making her the sixth fastest qualifier for the final, placing her in lane seven. Talbot told her to stay calm if Prozumenshchikova made an early attack, telling Whitfield that the third lap was the critical part of the race. The Australian public were not expecting much of Whitfield. Her final was on the same night as the women's 100-metre freestyle and the men's 200-metre freestyle, in which Shane Gould and Michael Wenden had been anticipated to win. After the first lap of the race, Whitfield seemed unlikely to deliver an upset victory, turning through the 50-metre mark in last place. She clawed back a little ground in the next lap but was still far behind at the midpoint of the race. She made her move in the third lap as instructed by Talbot, and began to reel in her opponents, causing a crowd reaction. She was fourth at the 150-metre mark, before moving into third place after the turn at Prozumenshchikova's expense before claiming the lead with 20 metres to go by passing Hungary's √Ågnes Kaczander and American Dana Schoenfield. Her time of 2m 41.71s was 2.5 s faster than her previous best, holding off a final ditch attack from Schoenfield. The 4√ó100-metre medley relay was an anti-climax as the Australians swam poorly and came fifth in their heat and failed to qualify for the final. On her arrival in her home town, she was accorded a street parade. This was Whitfield's career peak. She won both breaststroke titles the following year at the Australian Championships in times slower than she had recorded in Munich, but failed to win a medal at the 1973 World Aquatics Championships in Belgrade. Again in 1974, she won both events at the national championships in even slower times, but managed only a bronze in the 200-metre event in a time of 2 m 43.58 s and a silver in the medley relay. In 1975, she lost both of her national titles, and subsequently retired, admitting that she had lost her drive to compete. She later worked for a period as a youth worker for the New South Wales Department of Youth and Community Services in Shellharbour and Wollongong. Whitfield was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame in 1995.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honourees, Beverley Whitfield (AUS). Retrieved 6 April 2015. She died suddenly in 1996 at the age of 42. Whitfield's strength was her kick, with ergometer tests showing her leg power to be comparable to that of weightlifters.

It comes from warmer parts of the West Atlantic, including the Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico. It is a drab, mottled-gray fish lacking the distinguishing features of most other groupers. Its pattern of markings resemble the box-shaped spots of the black grouper (Mycteroperca bonaci). It lacks the streamer-points on the tail fin that scamp (M. phenax) and yellowmouth grouper (M. interstitialis) have, and lacks yellow coloration around the mouth. Description Mycteroperca microlepis has an oblong, robust body which is laterally compressed. The depth of the body is normally less than the length of the head and it is usually roughly equal in depth at the origin of the dorsal fin and at the anal fin origin. The standard length is three to three and a half times the depth of the body. The dorsal profile of the head is convex and the preopercle has a rounded lobe at its angle which is has enlarged serrations. The dorsal fin contains 11 spines and 16-18 soft rays while the anal fin contains 3 spines and 10-12 soft rays. The membranes between the dorsal fin spines are notched with the third and fourth spines being the longest. The caudal fin is square. The adult females and the juveniles are normally pale grey to brown-grey marked with darker blotches and wavy lines that give a marbled appearance to the upper flanks and back. The pelvic, anal and caudal fins have bluish-black margins. When resting they often assume a camouflage pattern with 5 dark brown saddles separated by white bars along the base of the dorsal fin. The large adult males are typically pale to medium grey in colour, with an indistinct reticulated pattern underneath the dorsal fin. They are darker grey or black on the breast and belly, with a similar colour on the margins of the soft rayed part of the dorsal find the caudal fin, as well as the posterior margins of the pectoral and pelvic fins. There is also a colour phase called \\"black-back\\" which has the rear end of the body and all of the soft rayed part of the dorsal fin and the anal fin are black. This species attains a maximum total length of although is a more common length, and the maximum published weight attained is . Distribution Mycteroperca microlepis is found in the western Atlantic Ocean where it has a disjunct distribution. The northern population is found around Bermuda and along the eastern coast of the United States from North Carolina south to Yucatan Peninsula of Mexico but it is largely absent from Cuba, apart from one record of a vagrant. The southern population is found in southern Brazil from Rio de Janeiro State to Santa Catarina State. Juveniles have been recorded in as far north as Massachusetts. Habitat and biology Mycteroperca microlepis have different habitat preferences as juveniles and adults. The juveniles are found in estuaries and beds of sea grass] while the adults are found farther offshore over rocky substrates at depths of and have been recorded as deep as . Adults are occasionally recorded inshore over rock sea beds or sea grass beds. It is one of the commonest species of grouper on the eastern Gulf of Mexico. They can be found both in brackish and marine waters. The adults can be found either in groups of 5-50 fish or as solitary fish. They have been recorded producing thumping sounds when under stress, this is done by vibrating the swim bladder using muscular contractions. The adults are predators on fishes (including smaller conspecifics), crabs, shrimps, and cephalopods while the smaller juveniles prey on crustaceans within the beds of sea grass in shallow waters. The fishes preyed are largely herring, sea bream, jacks and pompanos, drums and grey mullet. This species is a protogynous hermaphrodite, all fish start life as females, attaining sexual maturity between the ages of 5 and 6 years old and having reached a total length of , they will spawn at least once and then some will change sex and become males. In the offshore waters between North Carolina and Florida during 1976-1982 the sex ration was found to favour females, with 84% of the population being female, 15% were males and 1% were in the process of sex change. However, a subsequent study discovered that proportion of males had decreased to around 5.5%, fishing pressures which is concentrated on large males being the probable cause of this result. Although the sex change can occur as early as 5 years old it is more typical for it to take place at 10 to 11 years old and at a total length between . In the Atlantic coastal waters between North Carolina and Florida there are annual migrations in late winter, these migrations involve sexually mature fishes moving to offshore spawning grounds where at depths of . The spawning season in this region runs from December through May, peaking in late March and early April. In the eastern Gulf of Mexico, the spawning season runs from late December through to April, here it peaks in February and April. After spawning the females move towards shallower waters, with depths less than while the males prefer waters of They maximum recorded age is 31 years. Taxonomy Mycteroperca microlepis was first formally described as Trisotropis microlepis in 1879 by the American ichthyologists George Brown Goode (1851-1896) and Tarleton Hoffman Bean (1846-1916) with the type locality given as Florida. Utilisation and threats Mycteroperca microlepis is targeted by commercial and recreational fisheries using handline, bottom longline and speargun. Fishermen target the spawning aggregation while the juveniles are frequently caught as bycatch in the bait-shrimp fishery that fishes over sea grass beds. There have been reports of ciguatera poisoning among humans following the consumption of flesh from M. microlepis. This species is threatened by and is vulnerable to overfishing and both Mexico and the United States have introduced conservation measures.

It is about a company of actors who stage a dramatization of the story of Joan of Arc, and the effect that the story has on them. As in the musical Man of La Mancha, most of the actors in the drama play two or more roles. Ingrid Bergman was the star of the original production, playing both Joan and Mary Grey, the fictional star actress who portrays her. As the play begins, Mary Grey and the fictional director of the play-within-a-play, Jimmy Masters, are in conflict over how Joan is to be played. The conflict is resolved during the course of the play. Bergman won a Tony Award for this performance ‚Äî one of the first such awards ever given. Other notable actors who appeared in this production were Joseph Wiseman and Sam Wanamaker. In 1948, an adaptation of Joan of Lorraine was filmed in Technicolor as Joan of Arc. This film also starred Ingrid Bergman, but it did not use the play-within-a-play framework. Instead, it made the story a straightforward account of Joan's life, omitting the fictional acting company altogether. Anderson's dialogue for the story of Joan was not only retained, but, in collaboration with Andrew Solt, expanded with additional scenes involving historical characters who do not appear in the original play. For her performance, Ingrid Bergman was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost out to Jane Wyman in Johnny Belinda.

The Episcopal Church of the Epiphany was built in Hermanville in 1887. By 1982, the congregation had become inactive as population decreased. In 1985 the building was moved to the Mississippi Agriculture and Forestry Museum in Jackson, where it is used as a chapel.

He was the eldest son of Someshvara I. During his reign Someshvara II was constantly under threat from his more ambitious younger brother Vikramaditya VI. Eventually Someshvara was deposed by Vikramaditya VI. Around 1070 AD Someshvara II expanded his empire and brought Malava under his control. Chola invasion Almost immediately after coming to power, Someshvara II had to face an invasion by the Chola forces led by Virarajendra Chola. The Chola army invaded the Chalukya country and laid a siege to the town of Gutti in (Kurnool district) and attacked Kampili. Instead of assisting his brother in order to save the Chalukya kingdom, Vikramaditya turned the troubles of his brother into his opportunity to capture the Chalukya throne. Vikramaditya's Opportunism Vikramaditya saw the opportunity presented by the confusion in the kingdom due to the Chola invasion. Vikramaditya seduced Someshvara's feudatories from their loyalty towards the monarch, and with their aid, entered into negotiations with the Chola king Virarajendra. Vikramaditya made his alliance with Virarajendra. Chalukya civil war The political situation drastically changed when Virarajendra died in 1070 and his son Athirajendra Chola came to the Chola throne. Kulothunga Chola I eventually came to the Chola throne in a confusion created by civil disturbances in which Athirajendra was assassinated. As Vikramaditya was antagonistic towards Kulothunga, Someshvara II went into an alliance with Kulothunga and prepared to attack Vikramaditya. The conflict eventually occurred in 1075 when Kulothunga launched an attack on Vikramaditya. Someshvara aided Kulothunga Chola by attacking Vikramaditya's rear. What resulted was a brief civil war in which Someshvara suffered heavy defeats and his fate is unknown after the defeat.. Vikramaditya captured the Chalukya king and imprisoned him. Vikramaditya VI proclaimed himself the Chalukuya king in 1076. See also * Virarajendra Chola * Kulothunga Chola I  References  * Nilakanta Sastri, K.A. (1955).

It used a 3-die step system for combat (one die was used for attacking, one for defending, and one for spells & mental abilities). Game Mechanics =Classes= Demon's Lair used a dual-class system. The basic class was the definer of your core abilities, and your \\"profession\\" was used to fine-tune your abilities. There were three class- headers in Demon's Lair, which would determine things such as hit points, combat dice, and skills. There were Warrior Classes (Archer, Fighter, Martial Artist, Street Fighter, Weapon Master), Rogue Classes (Bard, Investigator, Spy, Thief, Thrill Seeker), Scholar Classes (Cleric, Mage, Psychic, Sage, Shaman), and the \\"miscellaneous\\" classes of Civilian and Djorre'l. The djorre'l was a jack-of-all-trades sort of class, with harsh hindrances to make up for the excessive benefits. Once a class was picked, you could add a profession, which would add and modify to your abilities and skills. Professions were not required for a character, however, and later supplements to the rules would show that a character was better off not choosing a profession. =Races= Demon's Lair used most of the common fantasy races, including the gnome, dwarf, human, elf, and orc. However, they did have some unique races, including the following: -Dakhan - This was an evil race, similar to the dark elf of D&D;, but wasn't subterranean. They were also not connected with the elven race. -Draga - This was a race of lizardmen, who would look similar to man-sized dragons. -F√¶ries - Shorter in height (between dwarves & humans), with fairy wings and colorful hair/skin/eyes. -Ithok - Very human-like in nature, but stronger & stockier, and with improved eyesight (each eye had two pupils). -Tarn - Tarns were metallic-skinned kins of elves & dwarves, with a strict caste society. -Toppan- Toppan were a race of cat like people, very dignified and majestic, taller the most humans and sleeker. =Magic= The magic system used Magic Points, and the players would find grand tomes to copy, which would allow them to attain the spells from that grand tome (examples: Book of Fire; Book of Ritual Magic, Book of Summoning). So, if you were 5th level, and had the book of Summoning, your character would be able to cast any spell from that book that was 5th level or lower, as long as you had enough MP. Also, many spells had abstract MP levels to cast it, which would affect the damage taken to the target of the spell on a 1:1 ratio. For example, if Bob the mage cast the spell \\"Flame Bolt\\" on Bill the fighter, and he had 50 MP available to him, he could blow all his MP and do 45 damage to Bill the fighter (5 MP base cost +45 MP damage). =Combat= In Demon's Lair, combat was run using a die-vs-die system. The attacker would roll his \\"Combat Die\\" (CD) versus the opponents \\"Physical Defense Die\\" (PDD). After modifiers are added, the high roll wins. (ties went to the attacker) All weapons did a set amount of damage. Magical attacks would work in a similar fashion, where the spellcaster's \\"Magic Defense Die\\" (MDD) would roll off against the defender's MDD. The high roll would win. Order in the round would be determined by a d10 roll of \\"Order of Combat\\" (OoC). Your character's CD, PDD, & MDD were determined by your class-heading. Each class-header would get a d10, d8, and a d12 for each die-type. Terrania Characters in the Demon's Lair game system would tromp around in the make-believe world of Terrania. The politics of Terrania were such that, at the point of the system being released, the kingdoms were all-encompassing within the continents. The continents were spaced apart within 1 to 2 week boat rides. Five of the kingdoms were formally the mega-continent of Lasalion, which was torn asunder during the war with the demon, Torlon. The remaining kingdoms were known as the \\"outlands.\\" =Bonlund= Bonlund was a kingdom that was north of the central kingdom of Dybana, and was one of the continents that tore apart from the original continent of Lasalion. It had a similar culture to that of 14th- century England. =Shatashatora= Another former Lasalion continent, it was a kingdom to the west of Dybana. The styles & cultures were similar to that of dynastic China, and feudal Japan. =Mastma= Mastma lied east of the central kingdom of Dybana, and was the third Lasalion continent. It was a desert land, with small similarities to ancient Egypt, but with more similarities to a gun- free American west. (the tech for firearms was not developed on Terrania as yet) =Norfic= The fourth Lasalion continent fell south of Dybana, the central kingdom. It was mostly filled with nomadic tribes, and had a culture similar in style to Scandinavia. =Dybana= Dybana was the fifth Lasalion continent, sitting in the middle of the four continents mentioned above. It was a kingdom of closely lain large islands, and had a culture similar to that of the ancient Greeks & Romans (if they would have had Renaissance technologies). The former capital of the Lasalion Empire, Fata Morgana, is currently underwater after the continental split. =Magansi= Magansi was a floating island, of the size of Australia. It was a haven for scholars, and had the holy shrine of the magic god atop the highest peak on it. Magansi was ripped from Terrania at the time that the Lasalion continent was torn apart. =Saopolo= Saopolo was one of the outland continents, and was found east of Bonlund and north of Mastma. Its climate ranged from tropical rain-forest in the south, to frigid fir-tree forests in the north. In the dead-center of the continent lies \\"The Chaos,\\" which was a tear in the fabric of the prime- material plane. If you ventured into the Chaos, it was quite difficult to get out. The culture of Saopolo was a combination of Southern US and Brazil, with Renaissance technology. =Druu= Druu was an outland kingdom of harsh cold. It could be found to the northwest of Bonlund, and north of Shatashatora. Druu was the home of the ithok race, and the culture was similar to that of Russia. =Tarnia= Tarnia was an outland kingdom west of Norfic and southwest of Shatashatora. It's the home of the tarn race, but also has some non-tarn settlements. =Dakharra= Dakharra was an outland kingdom that sat north of Tarnia, south of Druu, far east of Mastma, and west of Shatashatora. It's the home of the Dakhans, and was an evil empire that would regularly attack Tarnia, Shatashatora, and Mastma. =Mordestan= Mordestan was an outland kingdom that was northeast of Norfic and southeast of Mastma. The culture was similar to that of eastern-Europe and Transylvania. Mordestan also had quite the undead problem. Opinions Some gamers enjoyed the system immensely, as the skills & battle skills systems made the average character very customizable. Others felt that the game was excessively tilted towards power- gaming & munchkining. There were also issues with the lack of seriousness in the system. The spell system also had a fatal flaw, in that spellcasters of low levels could blast out a spell that could kill most anyone, as long as they had the MP for it. This game is currently out-of-print; Lasalion Games went out of business in June 2004.

Many White students wanted to attend Jones Vanguard because they would be a racial minority at Jones and wanted to learn about another culture. The Vanguard students competed with the regular students for class rankings slots. The highest class rankings had guaranteed admission to universities in Texas, and Vanguard students had higher grade point averages than regular students. Parents of children in the program clashed with the administration of the school over various matters. Members of the Vanguard community accused various administrators, receptionists, and teachers of expressing a disdain for the Vanguard program because of a belief that the Vanguard program expressed elitism. Parents also criticized the school for not properly marking attendance sheets, forcing parents to examine attendance records and question the Jones administration about attendance. In the fall of 2001, the Vanguard program got Dr. James Simpson as a principal of a separate school. The move that prompted the program's separation from Jones High School altogether was the reinstatement of Allen, a fired Jones principal who was reinstated several days later after protests from neighborhood residents, African-American Vanguard parents and Jones alumni. Craig Beverly, a 1979 graduate of Jones Vanguard, restarted the Jones Alumni Association when his son informed him that Allen was being removed from his post. Beverly argued that Allen needed to be reinstated. Kaye Stripling, the interim superintendent, said that the reinstatement had nothing to do with Quanell X's protests for local Houston- area news stations, and that it had nothing to do with the fact that Allen's mother, Alma Allen, was a member of the Texas State Board of Education. When reinstated he only was in charge of the comprehensive program at Jones. Stripling decided to let Allen keep his job, but she allowed the Vanguard program to move to the former Carnegie Elementary School. Beverly said that he was going to sue the district to try to stop the Vanguard program from leaving Jones. By fall 2002, the program was moved to a separate school, Carnegie Vanguard High School. As of 2005, Jones had Texas Southern Math and Science Academy . Margaret Downing of the Houston Press said that some parents told her that school administration officials asked African-American students to stay at Jones and take Advanced Placement classes instead of moving to Carnegie Vanguard.

A north-south road in northern St. Lucie County and southern Indian River County, it is locally known as Emerson Avenue throughout its route. SR 607 formerly extended into Indian River County, with its northern terminus being at Vero Beach. Route description SR 607's two north-south lanes pass through orange groves in St. Lucie County. History According to a 1960 map prepared by State Road Department (forerunner of the Florida Department of Transportation), Emerson Road shared its SR 607 designation with Indrio Road (present SR 614) and Kings Highway (present SR 713). At that time, Angle Road east of Kings Highway was signed State Road 607A. The road originally ran long, extending into Indian River County along 27th Avenue to SR 60 in Vero Beach. This portion threads between residential developments and is an important commuter road for this growing section of the eastern coast of Florida. Prior to 1978, SR 607 was a primary access road for the local orange groves, once the primary source of commerce of the region (and still a significant industry). Between 1978 and 1980, it served to \\"bridge the gap\\" between the incomplete Interstate 95 (SR 9) and Florida's Turnpike in Indian River and St. Lucie counties. Southbound motorists would exit I-95 at the temporary southern end at SR 60 (Osceola Boulevard/20th Street) west of Vero Beach, travel southward the length of SR 607, then right one mile (1.6 km) on SR 614 (Indrio Road) before going south the remaining on SR 713 (Kings Highway) to SR 70 (Okeechobee Road) and a trumpet interchange with the Turnpike in Fort Pierce.

The concept of anatopism is less widely familiar than that of anachronism, perhaps because much that is anatopic is also anachronistic. Yet the distinction is a valid one; not all that is anatopic is necessarily also anachronistic. The online Collins English Dictionary gives a synonym for \\"anatopism\\": anachorism (from Greek: + , \\"place\\"): \\"a geographical misplacement; something located in an incongruent position\\".https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/anachorism). Examples Catherine Hardwicke's 2006 film The Nativity Story shows a field of maize in a Nazareth farming scene. Maize is native to Mesoamerica, not to the Middle East, and in pre-Columbian times was grown only in the Americas. The use of maize in this film is an anatopism as well as an anachronism. The same anatopism appears in the first part (\\"The Warrior Pharaohs\\") of a three- part 2002 PBS documentary series on \\"Egypt's Golden Empire\\" depicting the history of ancient Egypt's New Kingdom: ears of maize corn are shown in a scene recreating the battle and siege of Megiddo in the 15th century BCE. Ridley Scott's 2000 film, Gladiator, set in 180 CE, features Roman soldiers riding horses using saddles with stirrups. While the Romans had had saddles since about 100 BCE, and stirrups had existed in the world since about 700 BCE, stirrups did not appear in Europe until about the 6th or 7th century CE, making them both anatopic and anachronistic. The opening scene of Disney's 1994 film, The Lion King, features a variety of African animals venturing to Pride Rock. However, the ants that appear in the scene hold leaves in their mandibles, behavior that only leaf cutter ants in Latin America exhibit. John Ford's much-lauded 1939 film Stagecoach was filmed in Monument Valley on the Arizona-Utah border, but textually set in southern Arizona and southern New Mexico. The vegetation and topography of Monument Valley and the lower- altitude deserts are vastly different, rendering the film's actual location notably anatopic. The Polish writer Boles≈Çaw Prus, for the sake of making a point, introduces into chapter 63 of his historical novel Pharaoh, set in the ancient Egypt of 1087‚Äì1085 BCE, a substance that behaves like gunpowder.Boles≈Çaw Prus, Pharaoh, pp. 579-81. This appears to be both an anachronism and an anatopism, since gunpowder is thought to have been invented, some time later, in China or in Arabia. Another apparent anatopism introduced by the author (in chapter 45) is an object that resembles a telescope,Boles≈Çaw Prus, Pharaoh, p. 391. that may also be an anachronism.

He was associated with the aristocratic circle of the late Stanis≈Çaw II Augustus, the last Polish king before the foreign partitions of Poland. Lampi settled in Warsaw around 1815 at the age of 33, and established himself as the leading landscape and portrait artist in Congress Poland soon after Napoleon's defeat in Russia. Early life Lampi was the son of renowned Italian historical painter Johann Baptist von Lampi the Elder from Romeno (b.1751) known as Jan Chrzciciel Lampi in Poland, who was invited to Warsaw by King Stanis≈Çaw II August in 1786 when Franz (Franciszek) was 4 years old (or between 1788 and 1791, according to different source). He was born in Klagenfurt, where his father worked on commissions for the Austrian court. He was the younger brother of Johann Baptist von Lampi (b.1775), also a portrait painter in the Lampi family; and was initially taught painting by his father, before entering the Academy of Fine Arts Vienna in the studios of Hubert Maurer and Heinrich F√ºger. When he was 15 years old, the Lampi family relocated to St. Petersburg in 1797 during the third and final partition of Poland, enticed by an extremely generous offer from the Tsar. Estranged from his father, and disinherited, Franciszek Lampi left St. Petersburg at the age of 32 after the Napoleonic Wars, and settled in Warsaw a year later in 1815. The already well-established reputation of his father in Poland as well as his own Polish childhood helped him blend into society. Later career He exhibited at Warsaw Salons in 1828, 1838, 1841 and 1845; and opened a small private art school in 1841. Close-up of Viennese beauty by Lampi (see below) Lampi painted mostly aristocratic portraits and specialized in the Romantic depictions of attractive women. What's more, he produced fantastic landscapes and seascapes inspired by the new intellectual forces of the Age of Enlightenment and the philosophical evolution of Romanticism in Poland. His art style was similar to the work of Italian Salvator Rosa and Claude Joseph Vernet of France. He gave art classes in his studio, but also traveled. In 1817‚Äì1819 he was teaching in Krak√≥w. Among his most notable students were Wojciech Korneli Stattler and Piotr Micha≈Çowski. In 1823 he went to Lublin on commission, in 1830 to Vilna. After the November Uprising against the Russian Empire he spent a few years in Wroc≈Çaw (Breslau) before returning to Warsaw in 1836. In 1840 he visited Dresden, Berlin and Munich ‚Äì known as Franz Xaver Ferdinand von Lampi in German. In 1850 Lampi returned to Warsaw where he died in 1852 at the age of 70, said to have been a possible victim of the cholera outbreak. His work can be found at the National Museum of Poland and its branches including Warsaw, Krak√≥w, Pozna≈Ñ as well as in the Mykolas ≈Ωilinskas Art Gallery (Kaunas, Lithuania).

It conceptualises victims as having understandable reactions to traumatic events rather than suffering from mental illness. Trauma models emphasise that traumatic experiences are more common and more significant in terms of aetiology than has often been thought in people diagnosed with mental disorders. Such models have their roots in some psychoanalytic approaches, notably Sigmund Freud's early ideas on childhood sexual abuse and hysteria,Candace Orcutt, Trauma in Personality Disorder: A Clinician's Handbook (AuthorHouse, 2012). Pierre Janet's work on dissociation, and Bowlby's attachment theory. There is significant research supporting the linkage between early experiences of chronic maltreatment and severe neglect and later psychological problems.Main, M. & Hesse, E. (1990). \\"Parents' unresolved traumatic experiences are related to infant disorganized attachment status: Is frightened and/or frightening parental behavior the linking mechanism?\\" In Greenberg, M., Cicchetti, D., and Cummings, M. (Eds.), Attachment In The Preschool Years: Theory, Research, and Intervention. Chicago: University of Chicago Press. In the 1960s trauma models became associated with humanist and anti-psychiatry approaches, particularly in regard to understanding schizophrenia and the role of the family. Personality disorders have also been a focus, particularly borderline personality disorder, with the role of dissociation and 'freezing responses' (more extreme reactions than fight-flight when someone is terrified and traumatised) thought to have a significant role in the aetiology of psychological disturbance. Extreme versions of trauma models have implicated the fetal environment and the trauma of being born, but these are not well-supported in the academic literature and have been associated with recovered memory controversies. People are traumatised by a wide range of people, not just family members. For example, male victims of sexual abuse report being abused in institutional settings (boarding schools, care homes, sports clubs). Trauma models thus highlight stressful and traumatic factors in early attachment relations and in the development of mature interpersonal relationships. They are often presented as a counterpoint to psychiatric orthodoxy and inform criticisms of mental health research and practice in that it has become too focused on genetics, neurochemistry and medication. History From the 1940s to the 1970s prominent mental health professionals proposed trauma models as a means of understanding schizophrenia, including Harry Stack Sullivan, Frieda Fromm- Reichmann, Theodore Lidz, Gregory Bateson, Silvano Arieti and R.D. Laing. Based on their clinical work they theorised that schizophrenia appears to be induced by children's experiences in profoundly disturbed families and reflect victims attempts to cope with such families and live in societies that are inherently damaging to people's psychological well-being. In the 1950s Sullivan's theory that schizophrenia is related to interpersonal relationships was widely accepted in the United States. Silvano Arieti's book Interpretation of Schizophrenia won the American National Book Award in the field of science in 1975. The book advances a psychological model for understanding all the regressive types of the disorder.associazionesilvanoarieti.org ‚Äì page on Arieti (mostly in Italian) Some of the psychogenic models proposed by these early researchers, such as the \\"schizophrenogenic mother\\", came under sustained criticism, from feminists who saw them as 'mother-blaming' and from a psychiatric profession that increasingly moved towards biological determinism. From the 1960s pharmacological treatments became the increasing focus of psychiatry, and by the 1980s the theory that the family dynamics could be implicated in the aetiology of schizophrenia became viewed as unacceptable by many mental health professionals in America and Europe. Before his death in 2001, at 90, Theodore Lidz, one of the main proponents of the \\"schizophrenogenic\\" parents theory, expressed regret that current research in biological psychiatry was \\"barking up the wrong tree\\". ‚Äì article on Theodore Lidz Like Lidz, Laing maintained until his death that the cause of both schizoid personality disorder and schizophrenia was influenced by family relationships. And more recent research bears this out, e.g. child abuse has been shown to have a causal role in depression, PTSD, eating disorders, substance abuse and dissociative disorders, and research reveals that the more severe the abuse the higher the probability that psychiatric symptoms will develop in adult life. Judith Herman's book Trauma and Recovery has heavily influenced therapeutic approaches. Recovery entails three phases which are best worked through sequentially: First 'establishing safety'; secondly 'a process of remembrance and mourning for what was lost'; thirdly 'reconnecting with community and more broadly, society'. Critiques Critics of the model, such as August Piper, argue that the logic that childhood trauma causes insanity has a serious flaw: If the claim was true, the abuse of millions of children over the years should have caused higher prevalence rates of mental disorders than the literature reveals. Other critics, particularly proponents of behaviour family therapy, have seen trauma models as parent blaming, and have emphasised the fact that families are usually the main, and often only, source of support for people diagnosed with severe mental illness. Lucy Johnstone has pointed out that some critics advocate family interventions for adult psychiatric patients whilst at the same time maintaining that childhood experiences are not causal as regards mental illness - as if family members can only have a helpful or damaging impact on their adult children. In response to Piper's assertion, it has been noted that Arieti stated in Interpretation of Schizophrenia that a trauma is more significant when committed by people to whom young human beings are emotionally bonded, and abuse is often interwoven with other forms of neglect and confusing behaviours from care-givers: Recent approaches A 2005 meta-analysis of schizophrenia revealed that the prevalence of physical and sexual abuse in the histories of people diagnosed with psychotic disorders is very high and has been understudied. This literature review revealed prevalence rates of childhood sexual abuse in studies of people diagnosed with schizophrenia ranging from 45% to 65%. An analysis of the American National Comorbidity Study revealed that people who have endured three kinds of abuse (e.g., sexual, physical, bullying) are at an 18-fold higher risk of psychosis, whereas those experiencing five types are 193 times more likely to become psychotic. A 2012 review article supported the hypothesis that current or recent trauma may affect an individual's assessment of the more distant past, changing the experience of the past and resulting in dissociative states. Several reviews of risk factors for common mental disorders have emphasised trauma. Such research has rejuvenated interest in this field, both from clinicians, researchers and service user organisations such as the Hearing Voices movement. Psychiatrist Colin Ross calls his model the \\"trauma model of mental disorders\\" and emphasises that, unlike biological models, this addresses the literature on comorbidity of trauma with mental disorders. Ross describes the theoretical basis of his trauma model as common sense: \\"The problem faced by many patients is that they did not grow up in a reasonably healthy, normal family. They grew up in an inconsistent, abusive and traumatic family. The very people to whom the child had to attach for survival were also abuse perpetrators and hurt him or her badly.... The basic conflict, the deepest pain, and the deepest source of symptoms, is the fact that mom and dad's behavior hurts, did not fit together, and did not make sense.\\" ‚Äì Colin Ross' web site In terms of psychoses, most researchers and clinicians believe that genetics remains a causative risk factor but \\"genes alone do not cause the illness\\". Modern views of genetics see genes more like dimmer switches, with environmental factors switching the genes on; the more severe the environmental stress, the more effect genes have. In the field of criminology, Lonnie Athens developed a theory of how a process of brutalization by parents or peers that usually occurs in childhood results in violent crimes in adulthood. Richard Rhodes's Why They Kill describes Athens's observations about domestic and societal violence in the criminals' backgrounds. Both Athens and Rhodes reject the genetic inheritance theories. Criminologists Jonathan Pincus and Dorothy Otnow Lewis believe that although it is the interaction of childhood abuse and neurological disturbances that explains murder, virtually all of the 150 murderers they studied over a 25-year period had suffered severe abuse as children. Pincus believes that the only feasible remedy for crime would be the prevention of child abuse. The logical conclusion of the trauma model is that the task for clinicians is not to treat biological disorders but to help people manage and modify their learned, and often embedded, responses to traumas they have experienced. As such, services need to be reconstituted to focus on this aim.

Early life Norman was born in Adelaide and left school at 13. He worked as a labourer until he enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force's 2/10th Battalion in 1939 at the outbreak of World War II. He served in England, Tobruk, New Guinea and Borneo, where he was mentioned in dispatches for bravery in action as a signaller. After the war he worked on the docks in Port Adelaide and became a leader of the Waterside Workers' Federation and president of the Trades and Labor Council in 1964. Political career He won the federal seat of Sturt from Liberal incumbent Ian Wilson at the 1969 election with a 50 percent primary and 50.5 percent two-party vote from a 15 percent two-party swing. Foster's victory in the historically blue-ribbon Liberal seat was part of an 18-seat swing to Labor that nearly ended the Coalition's record tenure in government. However Wilson won the seat back at the 1972 election from a 2.7 percent swing even as Labor won government. Foster later served in the South Australian Legislative Council from 1975 to 1982 and was probably best known for his support of the Tonkin Liberal government's legislation to enable the Roxby Downs uranium mine in 1982. The legislation was very controversial, and was opposed at the time by Labor. Foster resigned from the Labor Party just before he crossed the floor to give the final vote required to pass the legislation.

Pyotr Petrovich Vershigora (first name also Petr) () or Petro Petrovich Vershyhora () ( ‚Äì 23 March 1963) was one of the leaders of the Soviet partisan movement in Ukraine, Belarus and Poland and later a writer. Petro Vershigora was born in the village of Severinovca near the Transnistrian town of Rybnitsa. His parents were ethnic Ukrainian teachers at the local rural school, who died during his childhood. As a young orphan he worked at various jobs, including shepherd, miller, and librarian, as well as amateur actor and musician in his native village. In 1927, after completing his conscript military service, he enrolled in the Odessa Fine Arts Academy and upon graduation worked as an actor and stage manager. In 1936 Vershigora completed his studies at cinema school and worked on several documentary films with the Kiev cinematographic company. Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union, he joined the Red Army. On 23 June 1942 he was air dropped on a reconnaissance mission in the German-occupied Oryol region with orders to join the underground resistance movement there. Within a few months Vershigora joined the partisan units led by Sydir Kovpak in northeastern Ukraine. After the death of Semyon Rudnev in the summer of 1943, he became Kovpak's right- hand man and the head of his scouting and reconnaissance elements. Under his leadership, the 1st Ukrainian Partisan Division raided German-occupied western Belarus and eastern Poland, harassing the German rear. On 3 July 1944 they joined the regular Soviet army that was fighting to expel German forces from Belarus. In August 1944, after three years of fighting, Vershigora was promoted to the rank of major general. After the war Vershigora taught at the military academy in Moscow and wrote a number of books, including Lyudi s chistoi sovestyu (People with a Clear Conscience, 1947), his memoirs about the war.

The club are currently competing in the Ghana Premier League. Founding years Ashanti Gold SC was founded in 1978 by a group of employees of the Ashanti Goldfields Corporation under the name of Goldfields Sporting Club famously known as Obuasi Goldfields. The employees pleaded with management of AGC to sponsor the team, but they were always refused. The employees continued to pay the salaries and costs for the team and in the 1984 season the club finished as runner-up in the FA Cup. The management took notice and, through their leading shareholder Lonrho, arranged funding and sent an English manager to help the fledgling team. Still, no senior management was brought in to run the club. Because of their success in the FA cup, the team was promoted to Ghana Premier League the most elite football division. For almost a decade the team struggled due to disorganization, until 1993 when a company official at AGC revamped the club and brought in another English manager. 2004 Obuasi Goldfields Sporting Club Ltd. were renamed AshantiGold Sporting Club Ltd. on April 16 due to AshantiGold Sporting Club's former owners Ashanti Goldfields Corporation. Years of success That next season, AshGold finished third in the division after only Ashanti powerhouses Asante Kotoko. The next year a 13-man Board of Directors was established and AshGold won the league. Over the next two years, AshGold won the league again. Pan-African Cups The AshGold has competed in three competitions representing Ashanti. In 1995 they reached the quarter-finals in the African Champions League and in 1996 only into the final 16. In 1997 they were the runners up of the African Champions League. Recent years Ashanti Gold SC has never matched the greatness of their three-year cup run, but have remained a top team in the First Capital Plus Bank Premier League. They continue to produce excellent footballers who have played throughout Europe.

Unlike most medieval/fantasy beat 'em ups, it featured an isometric viewing angle, some platforming (usually involving players stacking rocks or crates to climb on and jump to treasure chests), unusually large stylised sprites, and variable blood/gore settings. Unusually, there are two European versions of the game: one uses the title Light Bringer, and the other uses the title Dungeon Magic. While this game uses the same title as Taito's earlier NES game Dungeon Magic: Sword of the Elements, the two games are unrelated aside from their titles. Plot An evil magician has brought an evil spirit back to life and is plotting to seize control of the kingdom, and has kidnapped the princess for use as a sacrifice. Four warriors venture into the world of magic to save the princess of the kingdom from the wicked magician: Ash the knight, Gren the roving warrior, Cisty the elf, whose whole family was destroyed by the evil spirit in the past, and the old magician Vold with the magic staff must now set off to save the princess. Gameplay In this game, up to four players can choose from four different characters: a knight, a martial artist, an elven archer and a wizard. Consumable items: Collecting treasure gives experience points, and gaining levels slightly increases combo damage and shortens the charging time to perform a super attack (which is done by holding the attack button until the character glows yellow). Consuming food and drink items restores health, and picking up mice increases the chance to unleash a critical hit. Lastly, characters can pick up magical spheres which increase their ability to use their desperation attack. Weapons and shields: There are three different elemental weapons (fire, ice and lightning) that deal increased damage against certain enemy types (for instance, fire weapons do extra damage against orc-type enemies). The starting weapon and the secret \\"power\\" weapon do not deal elemental damage but instead can inflict critical hits randomly; the \\"power weapon\\" increases damage and has a higher critical rate. Characters can also pick up and use single-use projectile weapons such as spears and throwing axes; the crossbow is unique in that it can be fired five times. There are five different shields that allow you to completely negate enemy attacks before breaking. Items, weapons and shields can be found in barrels, crates, and treasure chests. However, players must be cautious to avoid traps, of which there are various kinds. The enemies in the game are fairly standard for a fantasy-them game, including orcs, slimes, lizardmen, werewolves, carnivorous plants, harpies, and others. Bosses (known as Roomguarders) include demons, giant snakes, a spider-woman, and more. The game also features numerous branching paths that present different rooms and secret areas. However, each path must be cleared against a time limit. If the player dawdles in an area too long, then ghosts will eventually appear and swarm the player as punishment. Players must play through the game multiple times to see all of the rooms available. =Characters= *Ash - Ash has many weaknesses compared to few strengths. Some of his weaknesses are a slow attack speed and a vulnerable special attack that has a very limited usage. His strengths are high combo damage (although his means of achieving it are not as effective as the other characters) and the most useful throw in the game. His desperation attack has a long duration, but its effectiveness is negated by low damage and its knockdown feature on all creatures but the giant serpents (which put together lower its damage potential, except against the serpents). Furthermore, his dashing attack does not knock down on hit, leaving Ash without a single reliable attack that knocks down enemies. Ash is best used by experienced players looking for a challenge. (Elemental swords affect Ash's combo, dashing attack, and special attack. The Jewel Star increases damage on the aforementioned attacks. Ash will blink white when his critical attack is triggered.) *Gren - Gren is a balanced and powerful character. His special attack is useful, and benefits greatly from the decreased charging time from high experience levels; however, it does not deal elemental damage. His combo attack can deal elemental damage, and is quick and excellent for performing infinite combos when stopped before the final attack; on the other hand, the final attack has a very high chance of unleashing a critical hit, especially with the Bare Knuckle gauntlets, for massive damage. Most importantly, Gren has the best dashing attack in the game; it hits multiple times, deals high damage, has excellent priority, and can deal elemental damage. Overall, Gren has no weaknesses and performs well throughout the entire game, and can even rival Vold once he gains the Bare Knuckle gauntlets. (Elemental gauntlets affect Gren's combo and dashing attack. The Bare Knuckle increases damage on the aforementioned attacks. Gren's attack will unleash blue flames when his critical attack is triggered; he can critical hit with his combo and dashing attack.) *Cisty - Cisty is a prominently long range fighter who also performs well in other areas. Her combo, as with Ash, is slow to come out but is effective when it fully connects; both Ash and Cisty have slow and risky infinite combos, and thus may have more problems against certain bosses. Furthermore, unfortunately, Cisty's combo does not benefit from elemental damage and does not get enhanced damage with her \\"power\\" weapon. Cisty's bomb attack can potentially hit every enemy on screen, but is very inconsistent and leaves her vulnerable afterward. Her throw is especially dangerous to use as it leaves her widely vulnerable. Cisty's strength lies in her ranged special attack which allows her to safely pick off enemies before they can reach her; however, the attack does not hit multiple enemies, unless they overlap, and thus must be used in conjunction with her slide attack to keep enemies at range. Her biggest weakness is against enemies that are too low or short to hit with arrows, such as the giant serpent, the toad enemies, and the wolf enemies. Overall, Cisty is a much improved Ash as she is superior in most aspects, but many of her moves leave her vulnerable. (Elemental bows only affect Cisty's arrow attack. The Strong Bow only increases the damage of her arrow attacks. Cisty's critical ability is different from the rest of the cast; it ONLY affects her special (NOT super) attack - it allows her to randomly fire off a super attack when using a normal special attack.) *Vold - Vold is the most powerful character in the game. His bomb attack is the most effective, covering excellent range, doing excellent damage, and being able to hit enemies twice due to its long duration. Vold alone has unique special attacks for each elemental weapon: some, such as the fire, ice, and holy staff, are much better than the others. The holy staff is the ultimate weapon in the game, allowing the powerful Vold to become nigh unstoppable. Thanks to his immensely overpowered special attacks, Vold is the easiest character to beat the game with. Vold's only weakness is his throw. His low combo damage is negated by the fact that he is the easiest character to perform infinite combos with, as his first combo attack has the least startup and lag. Vold is the most effective character in the game whether he is used by beginners or experts alike.

Broadly educated, he was also a social activist, legal advocate, city administrator and President of the Krak√≥w Agricultural Society (since 1853). The Sukiennice Museum, a division of the National Museum in Krak√≥w, contains a room that is named after him and devoted to Micha≈Çowski's work.

His artistic talent developed at an early age of 13 under the watchful eye of several artists including Micha≈Ç Stachowicz, J√≥zef Brodowski (1817) and Franciszek Lampi. He formally studied a broad range of subjects at the Jagiellonian University including classical philosophy, agriculture and mathematics. During the November Uprising against the Russian rulership, Micha≈Çowski helped run a Polish munition factory. To avoid capture, he escaped to Paris, France with his new wife Julia Ostrowska and her father. While in Paris, he continued his studies of painting and anatomy with Nicolas Toussaint Charlet (1832-1835), greatly influenced by the art of Th√©odore G√©ricault, Rembrandt and Vel√°zquez. His watercolour studies of horses became very popular in France, sold by local art dealers since 1833 to English, German and American collectors. Micha≈Çowski returned to Krak√≥w in 1835 and in 1837 settled into his family estate in Krzysztoforzyce. In the 1840s and 1850s he produced numerous equestrian paintings and dramatic landscapes including his famous Romantic \\"Battle of Somosierra\\" (1844-1855, several versions), \\"Parade before Napoleon\\" and other battle sites.

Early life and career Atkinson was born to longtime Nashville-area residents Fitzgerald Atkinson Sr. and Catherine Kerr Atkinson. He attended Davidson County public schools, including the former Central High School, from which he graduated. Following high school Atkinson enrolled in the University of the South in Sewanee, Tennessee, but left in June 1942 to serve in the United States armed forces in World War II. He enlisted into the United States Marine Corps, serving primarily with the 1st Tank Battalion, 1st Marine Division. He was wounded in the Battle of Okinawa and was subsequently awarded the Purple Heart and the Navy Cross. Atkinson was honorably discharged in 1946 and the same year was licensed as an insurance agent. Early in his insurance career, he was a partner in the insurance firm of Stokes, Bandy & Atkinson. Politics While with Stokes, Bandy & Atkinson, Atkinson was first elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives. Like almost all members of the Tennessee General Assembly from the western two-thirds of the state in that era, Atkinson was at least nominally a Democrat. However, the party's Southern wing, especially at this time, was not particularly liberal, and Atkinson was in many ways somewhat typical of his era. Atkinson was to serve a total of three terms in the Tennessee House, serving Davidson and Williamson Counties as a \\"floterial representative\\", part of an arcane system which was then in use in Tennessee to avoid the constitutionally-mandated redistricting of the House according to population every ten years following the census (and which was eventually invalidated by the United States Supreme Court in its landmark Baker v. Carr ruling). In 1964 Atkinson left Stokes and Bandy to form his own insurance firm. Atkinson's service in the Tennessee General Assembly came at time when there was no actual salary but rather only an expense per diem for the days in which the legislature was actually in session; in no way was politics providing him with a substantial living. In 1966, Atkinson was elected to an unusual five-year term as vice mayor under the Metropolitan Charter, which had been adopted by voters four years earlier to merge many of the functions of Davidson County and the Nashville municipal government. In one of the charter's many compromise provisions, most of which had been included to overcome the objections which had led to the defeat of an earlier Metropolitan Charter proposed during the 1950s, it was agreed that the second group of office holders elected under the charter would serve for five years rather than the usual four in order to take the metropolitan offices out of the election cycle for statewide offices such as governor and state legislature and holdover county offices such as property assessor, court clerk, and the like. Ostensibly this was in the interest of a shorter ballot and to give these offices the weight of importance that they deserved; to critics this provision meant to move the offices to being elected at a time when only persons with a strong interest in the local government -- most notably municipal employees and their families and friends -- were likely to vote. Atkinson's primary role as vice mayor (other than to serve as the mayor's successor in the event of his death, resignation, removal from office, or excessive absence from the city) was to serve as speaker of the Metropolitan Council. Atkinson's low-key leadership style and his desire for everyone, council member and member of the public alike, to be heard on any issue on which they desired to speak, was commended by some, but was harshly condemned by others, particularly some of the council members. Members of the Metropolitan Council, one of the largest U.S. municipal legislative bodies, composed of 40 part-time members, most of whom had other jobs, often found themselves getting home after meetings in the early hours of morning after any meeting involving contentious issues, which were fairly frequent. Nonetheless, Atkinson was encouraged by some to run for mayor in 1971, even after it became apparent that incumbent mayor Beverly Briley was going to seek a third term, permissible under the term limit provision then in the Metropolitan Charter, making him the second consecutive vice mayor to challenge Briley for the top spot. Unlike his previous races, Atkinson now faced several better-known and better-financed opponents. A total of nine candidates finally entered the race. Besides Briley and Atkinson, two other well-known Nashville political figures, Trustee Glenn Ferguson and Assessor of Property Clifford Allen were in the race. A surprise opponent was movie projectionist Casey Jenkins, who ran a campaign based on the idea of \\"massive resistance\\" to forced busing, which had just been ordered in the now-merged metropolitan school district to foster racial desegregation. Briley, Jenkins, Allen, and Ferguson all bought relatively large (for that period) amounts of television air time, which was beyond the financial ability of Atkinson's campaign. Atkinson finished fifth in the race. (Briley eventually defeated Jenkins in a runoff.) Later life Although Atkinson never sought elected office again, he was nonetheless active in many civic and charitable activities. He was an active member of Civitan and Kiwanis, as well as the United Methodist Church. He and wife, Ruth, resided in the Otter Creek Rd area of Davidson County, which he had represented years before in the legislature. His death was attributed to congestive heart failure. He is buried at Nashville's Woodlawn Memorial Park.

He has been a member of the South Australian Legislative Council since May 2006, representing the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. Wade has served as the Minister for Health and Wellbeing in the Marshall Ministry since 22 March 2018. Background and early career Wade was a ministerial adviser to former state minister Dr Michael Armitage before working in the water industry. Political career Wade nominated for the Liberal Party's Legislative Council ticket for the 2006 state election with the support of the party's moderate faction. It had been predicted that as a moderate he would only receive the distinctly unwinnable seventh position, but in an upset result, he instead took the theoretically winnable fifth position. However, the party suffered a particularly bad defeat at the election, and the party was only able to win three seats. Wade received a second chance soon after the election, however, when the Liberal Party opened nominations for a casual vacancy that had occurred prior to the election when former shadow minister Angus Redford resigned in order to make an unsuccessful bid to shift to the House of Assembly to contest the electoral district of Bright after Wayne Matthew resigned prior to the 2006 election. He emerged as the leading moderate contender for the position, challenging conservative Tim Keynes, who had occupied the fourth position on the ticket at the election and Joe Scalzi, a defeated Member of the House of Assembly. Keynes was widely seen as the favourite, particularly after the victory of conservative Cory Bernardi in a vote to fill a Senate vacancy in March, but in an upset result, Wade won 112-84-32 respectively in the first round of balloting, and 134‚Äì96 in the second. He was subsequently appointed to the vacancy on 2 May, the first sitting day of the new parliament, and served out the remaining four years of Redford's term. On 18 April 2007, within a year of the election, Wade was appointed to the Shadow Ministry. Following a reshuffle in July 2009, Wade served as Shadow Minister for Disability Services, Housing, Families and Communities, Social Inclusion and Assisting the Shadow Attorney-General. Wade was elected from second position on the Liberal ticket at the 2010 state election. A law graduate who has never practiced law, Wade was appointed Shadow Attorney-General and Shadow Minister for Justice in April 2010.

Biography  Born on December 25, 1942, in West Columbia, West Virginia, Stewart joined the Army from Ashland, Kentucky in 1960. Service Profile He served in Vietnam as a staff sergeant with Company B of the 2nd Battalion, 12th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile). On the morning of May 18, 1966, Company B was manning a defensive position when they were attacked by a reinforced North Vietnamese company, with the main thrust of the assault pitting Stewart's 6-man squad against a platoon-sized hostile force. Although his five squadmates fell wounded, Stewart ignored an opportunity to withdraw and instead held his position alone for four hours, tossing back enemy-thrown grenades and crawling through heavy fire to retrieve ammunition from the wounded. When a friendly platoon arrived and counterattacked the North Vietnamese, he moved forward and was killed while assisting their effort. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in September 1967. Stewart, aged 23 at his death, is buried in Middleport, Ohio. His name is listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (\\"The Wall\\") on panel 07E - Row 084.

Life  From 1809 to 1811, Karl Julius Perleb studied at the University of Freiburg and earned a doctorate in philosophy and in 1815 a degree in medicine. He lived in Vienna for a brief period of time. In 1818 he returned to the University of Freiburg and began a post-doctoral fellowship. He remained at the university for the remainder of his life. He became an associate professor of natural history in 1821, and in 1823 he became a full professor. From 1828 to 1845 he served as director of the Freiburg Botanical Garden. In 1838 he was appointed prorector at Freiburg University. He left his library and herbarium to the university, together wirh money for its administrastion and for travel grants for young scholars of the natural sciences.ADB:Perleb, Karl Julius at Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie  Work  Perleb was an author of numerous scientific publications and was a friend of Freiburg historian Heinrich Schreiber. He worked on the natural method of the classification of plants. In 1818 he translated de Candolle's Essai sur les propri√©t√©s m√©dicales des plantes compar√©es avec leur classification naturelle into German as Versuch √ºber die Arzneikr√§fte der Pflanzen, verglichen mit den √§u√üeren Formen und der nat√ºrlichen Classeneintheilung derselben, with additions and comments. This was followed in 1826 by his Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte des Pflanzenreichs in which he developed his own classification, based on that of de Candolle, but further developing the idea of a hierarchy in which orders were introduced as a rank between families and classes. He divided de Candolle's Calyciflorae into those with either fused of free petals and increased his number of subclasses by one. He then developed a key to the diagnostic ranks, updated from the Lehrbuch, his Clavis classium, ordinum et familiarum atque index generum regni vegetabilis (1838), following the method of Ray. In his system, there were 9 classes, 48 orders and 330 families. A second part of the Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte, the Lehrbuch der Zoologie was published in 1831. He also published an account of the botanical garden at Freiburg, De horto botanico Friburgensi (1829) = List of selected publications = SourcesBiodiversity Heritage Library published works * Versuch √ºber die Arzneikr√§fte der Pflanzen, verglichen mit den √§u√üeren Formen und der nat√ºrlichen Classeneintheilung derselben (1818) * Conspectus methodi plantarum naturalis in usum auditorum typis exscribi curavit (1822) * * De Horto Botanico Friburgensi (1829) * Lehrbuch der Naturgeschichte: Lehrbuch der Zoologie, (1831-1835) *  Legacy  The botanical genus Perlebia (synonym Bauhinia) is named in his honor.

The pass traverses the Continental Divide in the Lewis Range, along the boundary between the Lewis and Clark National Forest and the Flathead National Forest. The pass forms the southern limit of the Continental Ranges, a major grouping of the Rocky Mountains which extends as far north as McGregor Pass in the Northern Rockies of the Canadian province of British Columbia. The Great Bear Wilderness in Lewis and Clark National Forest is south of the pass and Glacier National Park is to the north. During the winter, the pass is the only way to cross the Continental Divide by road in the U.S. north of Montana's Rogers Pass (distinguished from British Columbia's Rogers Pass), because of the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex. History The pass was charted in December 1889 by John Frank Stevens, principal engineer of the Great Northern Railway (GN). The location of the pass had been rumored for several years beforehand, but it took Stevens and a Flathead guide named Coonsah, who had been hiding out with the Blackfoot in Browning, to discover it. The pass proved ideal for a railroad, because its approach was broad and open, within a valley ranging from one to six miles wide, and at a gentle grade that would not require extensive excavation or rockwork. Construction of the railroad through the pass began on August 1, 1890, starting from Fort Assinniboine toward Marias Pass. The railroad followed the Middle Fork of the Flathead River west of the Continental Divide.Guthrie, C.W., (2004), All Aboard for Glacier, Farcountry Press: Helena, MT, 1-56037-276-1 Stevens also discovered the pass across the Cascades in central Washington which bears his name. Roosevelt Memorial Obelisk A memorial to President Theodore Roosevelt was constructed along the Continental Divide at the top of the pass. Construction began in 1930, with the original intent to produce a granite archway across the highway, and a cornerstone was placed to the southeast of the highway. Eleanor Roosevelt was later on hand to place a small copper box filled with a copy of the bill that appropriated funds for the memorial as well as some other documents into the cornerstone. The obelisk is in height and extends into the ground. It has a tapering cement core covered on all sides with slabs of Montana granite quarried near Helena. It was later decided to build an obelisk instead of an archway; it was completed in 1931. Today, U.S. Route 2 uses the pass, along with the BNSF Railway, a successor to the Great Northern Railway. The railway line, which sees freight traffic, as well as Amtrak's Empire Builder, is part of BNSF's Northern Transcon line linking Chicago and the Pacific Northwest.

Many consider Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez to be the father of Mexican Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In 1972, he founded the first Child and Adolescent Psychiatry subspecialty program in Mexico, at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). He also founded and was the first president of AMPI (Mexican Child Psychiatry Association) in 1975. He was the training director of the only Child and Adolescent Psychiatry training program in Mexico, at UNAM, from 1972 until 1998. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez was considered the most influential psychiatrist in Mexico. In the early eighties, he was simultaneously President of the Mexican Psychoanalytic Association; Secretary General of the Mexican Board of Psychiatry; Director of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at UNAM; and Main Consultant to the System for the Integral Development of the Family (DIF), a nationwide government funded system of child and family guidance centers. His later contributions were in Bioethics, and he evolved into a researcher within this field and an International Psychoanalytic Association officer. Early life Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez was born into a middle-class family on 20 May 1941. Raised as an only child in downtown Mexico City, L√≥pez's father, Isa√≠as L√≥pez Su√°rez, was a Spanish prestigious downtown \\"abarrotero\\" (grocer) who owned his own food store. L√≥pez's mother, Carmen G√≥mez Alatriste (de L√≥pez), came from a Mexican family with historical lineage in Puebla. Her family had been much involved in the Mexican Liberal Movement of the 19th Century. Carmen's cousin, Aquiles Serd√°n Alatriste, was a notable figure of the Mexican Revolution of 1910. Carmen was also great granddaughter of Miguel C√°stulo Alatriste, a Governor of Puebla who fought as a liberal and was slayed during the \\"Guerra de Reforma\\" (Reform War). Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez was exposed to eminent Mexican intellectuals since he was a child. The influence of his academician uncle, Sealtiel L. Alatriste, and the writer and painter Dr. Atl (Gerardo Murillo) early on promoted his interest of the in-depth study of ideas and emotions. L√≥pez's mother and grandmother often invited famous members of the Mexican cultural circles to their apartment in San Juan de Letr√°n Avenue, in downtown Mexico City. The building where L√≥pez grew up housed the \\"Caf√© S√∫per Leche\\", which later gained national prominence when the building collapsed in the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. Many of L√≥pez's friends from childhood and their families died in the event. Education L√≥pez attended the Medical School at UNAM, Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico, with the idea of later training in Psychiatry and Psychoanalysis. As a medical student he developed strong relationships with the psychoanalytic group at UNAM, the psychiatrists at General Hospital of Mexico, and - through his father's Spanish connections - to the Hospital Espa√±ol de M√©xico. These relationships would later support his efforts of integrating differing groups into the training program he developed at UNAM. L√≥pez then graduated as a psychiatrist from the Medical College of Pennsylvania, and as a child and adolescent psychiatrist from the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute (EPPI). He studied Psychoanalysis and Child Psychoanalysis at the Institute of the Mexican Psychoanalytic Association. Psychiatric Practice L√≥pez lived and practiced from 1972 to 2009 in a suburb of Mexico City. From 2009 to 2013 he practiced in Barcelona, Spain, and in New York from 2013 to 2017. During his last years, L√≥pez helped organize the first program in child psychoanalytic training at IPTAR (The Institute For Psychoanalytic Training and Research), in New York City. Academic Life L√≥pez published more than 150 original articles and two books: \\"La Encrucijada de la Adolescencia (\\"The Crossroads of Adolescence\\") and \\"√âtica en Psiquiatr√≠a, Psicoan√°lisis y Psicoterapia\\" (\\"Ethics in Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychotherapy\\"). In 2018, the Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez Foundation published posthumously his book \\"Desarrollo de la Identidad y Nacionalismo Mexicanos: A Quinientos A√±os\\" (\\"The Development of Mexican Identity: A Psychological Perspective\\"). Mann de Day√°n describes the \\"Sensory Oversaturation Syndrome\\" as L√≥pez's main contribution to the psychodynamics of adolescence. According to this phenomenon, the adolescent manages to move away from his own narcissistic needs by overstimulating himself, as a first step before he projects his needs to outside sources. Death Manuel Isa√≠as L√≥pez died in New York City on November 29, 2017.

Calloselasma is a monotypic genus created for a venomous pit viper species, C. rhodostoma, which is endemic to Southeast Asia from Thailand to northern Malaysia and on the island of Java. No subspecies are currently recognized. Description From Karawang, West Java Underside of its body Attains an average total length of , with females being slightly longer than males. Occasionally, they may grow as long as .Mehrtens JM. 1987. Living Snakes of the World in Color. New York: Sterling Publishers. 480 pp. . A specimen with a total length of has a tail long. Dorsally it is reddish, grayish, or pale brown, with two series of large, dark brown, black-edged triangular blotches, which are alternating or opposite. There is also a thin dark brown vertebral stripe, which may be interrupted or indistinct in some specimens. The upper labials are pink or yellowish, and powdered with brown. There is a broad, dark brown, black-edged diagonal stripe from the eye to the corner of the mouth, with a narrower light-colored stripe above it. Ventrally it is yellowish, uniform or powdered or spotted with grayish brown. The smooth dorsal scales are arranged in 21 rows at midbody. Ventrals 138-157; anal plate entire; subcaudals 34-54 pairs.

This is the only Asian pit viper with large crown scales and smooth dorsal scales.U.S. Navy. 1991. Poisonous Snakes of the World. US Govt. New York: Dover Publications Inc. 203 pp. . Geographic range Found in Nepal, Thailand, Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, northern West Malaysia and on the Indonesian island of Java. The type locality is listed as \\"Java\\". There are unconfirmed, but credible reports from southern Myanmar (Burma), northern Sumatra and northern Borneo. Habitat and diet Prefers coastal forests, bamboo thickets, unused and overgrown farmland, orchards, plantations as well as forests around plantations, where it searches for rats and mice. Reproduction This species is oviparous and the eggs are guarded by the female after deposition. Venom This species has a reputation for being bad-tempered and quick to strike. In northern Malaysia it is responsible for some 700 incidents of snakebite annually with a mortality rate of about 2 percent. Remarkably sedentary, it has often been found in the same spot several hours after an incident involving humans. Its venom causes severe pain and local swelling and sometimes tissue necrosis, but deaths are not common. Many victims are left with dysfunctional or amputated limbs due to the lack of antivenom and early treatment. In a 2005 study of 225 Malayan pit viper (Calloselasma rhodostoma) bites in Thailand, most victims had mild to moderate symptoms, but 27 of 145 patients (18.6%) developed permanently swollen limbs. There were only two deaths (related to intracerebral hemorrhage) and no amputations. The antivenin manufactured in Thailand seemed effective in reversing the blood clotting caused by the venom. Most patients remained stable and did not require antivenin. The authors suggested that victims not use traditional healers and avoid overuse of tourniquets. In a prospective phase of the study, bites occurred throughout the year but mostly early in the monsoon season (May and June). =Venom and thrombosis treatment= The venom of this species is used to isolate a thrombin-like enzyme called ancrod. This enzyme is used clinically to break down and dissolve thrombi (blood clots) in patients and lower blood viscosity to help prevent heart attack and stroke.Guangmei Yan, Jiashu Chen, Pengxin Qiu, Hong Shan. \\"Fibrinolysin of Agkistrodon acutus Venom and its Usage.\\" References Further reading * Kuhl, H. 1824.

His staunch defence of his political party, the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) ‚Äì which leads the governing Barisan Nasional coalition ‚Äì led to him being given the moniker \\"Lion of UMNO\\". He was also known for his radical views on Malay sovereignty over Malaysia, and Malay supremacy in politics, and is of Hadhrami Arab descent.Official Website for Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia He was born in Celebes, Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia) and migrated when he was 14 years old to Singapore (then part of British Malaya). He served as the Secretary-General of UMNO during the early 1960s, but resigned after Singapore was allowed to secede from Malaysia. Political career After the 1963 Singapore state elections held shortly after Singapore merged with Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form Malaysia, it emerged that the Singapore UMNO branch had been terribly defeated by the ruling People's Action Party (PAP). Albar then travelled to Singapore to address the Malays, and denounced Malay PAP leaders such as Othman Wok as traitors to the Malay race and UnIslamic. Later, he had participated in verbal duels with the Singaporean Prime Minister, Lee Kuan Yew, over the issue of ketuanan Melayu (Malay sovereignty over Malaysia). Lee accused Albar of being an \\"ultra\\" for making remarks such as \\"Wherever I am, I am a Malay.\\" Lee criticised him for this, asking \\"If I had been going round and saying what [he] has been saying ‚Äì wherever I am, I am a Chinese ‚Äì where would we be? But I keep on reminding the people that I am a Malaysian. I am learning Bahasa Kebangsaan (Malay, the national language) and I accept Article 153 of the Constitution.\\"Keith, Patrick (2005). Ousted!, p. 128. Media Masters. . Albar also accused Lee and some other Chinese Malaysians ‚Äì referring to them as kaum pendatang or pendatang asing (immigrants) ‚Äì of being lodgers (orang tumpangan), abusing the hospitality of the Malays who were the \\"masters of the house\\". This provoked a response from Cabinet member Lim Swee Aun, who insisted \\"we are co-owners, not lodgers, not guests.\\"Lee, Kuan Yew (1998). The Singapore Story, p. 620. Marshall Cavendish Editions. .Keith, p. 115. Lee took a swipe at his politics by arguing \\"According to history, Malays began to migrate to Malaysia in noticeable numbers only about 700 years ago. Of the 39% Malays in Malaysia today, about one-third are comparatively new immigrants like the secretary-general of UMNO, Dato' Syed Jaafar Albar. Therefore it is wrong and illogical for a particular racial group to think that they are more justified to be called Malaysians and that the others can become Malaysian only through their favour.\\"Ye, Lin-Sheng (2003). The Chinese Dilemma, p. 143. East West Publishing. . The Malaysian Prime Minister, Tunku Abdul Rahman, eventually tired of the bickering and told Singapore to secede from Malaysia. The matter was hushed up, with not even the UMNO Members of Parliament such as Albar being informed of what 9 August 1965 Parliamentary session would be concerned about. When Albar demanded more information on why their presence was demanded, he was rebuffed. Upon discovering that day itself that the purpose of the meeting was to allow Singapore to secede, Albar left Parliament House, not participating in the final unanimous vote. As this was directly contrary to his orders, the Tunku insisted on sacking Albar as UMNO Secretary- General, but was later persuaded to permit Albar to graciously resign instead. Albar was opposed to the idea of allowing Singapore to secede, because he felt that imposing emergency rule over Singapore and removing Lee as Prime Minister would have been an ideal solution. Before secession, he had vocally called for Lee to be arrested for destroying racial harmony through his \\"Malaysian Malaysia\\" campaign, which the Malays saw as threatening the special rights granted to them under Article 153 of the Constitution. Albar also served as Minister of Rural Development for a time. Family Syed Jaafar had a son, Syed Hamid Albar, who later followed in his footsteps to be active in politics. Syed Hamid went on to serve as Foreign Affairs Minister and Home Minister. In April 2009 however, Syed Hamid was dropped from the cabinet. Death Syed Jaafar Albar died in 1977 in Kuala Lumpur and was buried in Makam Pahlawan near Masjid Negara, Kuala Lumpur.

He created landscapes, portraits and genre scenes in a combination Romantic and Realistic style. Most of his paintings are small.  Biography  He grew up just outside Krak√≥w, where his family had a small farm. They moved into Krak√≥w in 1846 to become merchants and he began his studies in 1850 at the Academy of Fine Arts with Wojciech Stattler and W≈Çadys≈Çaw ≈Åuszczkiewicz. His father was not supportive of his studies, so he had to continue working in their shop and taking his lessons intermittently.Brief biography and appreciation by Ewa Micke-Broniarek @ Culture.pl. In 1857, he began exhibiting with the Society of Friends of Fine Arts. Finally he sold some paintings and, with the assistance of Stattler, obtained a scholarship from the Ministry of Religion and Education which enabled him to enroll at the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna, where he studied with Ferdinand Georg Waldm√ºller, among others. He returned to Krak√≥w in 1862 and became involved with a patriotic group that met in the studio of the sculptor, Parys Filippi, which was located in the Church of St. Francis of Assisi. Although this group became involved in the January Uprising, Kotsis spent most of the years 1862 to 1864 painting church murals. After receiving another scholarship in 1866, he moved to Warsaw, then to Paris in 1867, followed by Brussels. When he returned home, he established a studio and worked constantly, spending his summers painting en plein aire in the Tatra mountains. He also began exhibiting extensively throughout Poland and Northern Europe. After 1870, he travelled frequently and, from 1871 to 1875, lived primarily in Munich, where he often exhibited with the Kunstverein M√ºnchen. He shared a studio with his friends, Antoni Kozakiewicz and Franz Streitt, and went on painting excursions to the Bavarian Alps with them. In 1875, he received an offer of a professorial chair at his alma mater but, that same year, was diagnosed with an incurable brain disorder. He was forced to refuse the chair and was unable to continue working. He died two years later.

Berlin. 1st Edition. 368 pp. . is a venomous pit viper species endemic to Hunan and Guangdong provinces in China. No subspecies are currently recognized. This is a nocturnal pit viper that is also known as the Mangshan iron-head snake, Chinese pit viper, and the Ironhead viper. They eat frogs, birds, insects, and small mammals. They have a white tail tip that they wiggle to mimic a grub so that prey comes into striking range - a behaviour known as caudal luring. The venom causes blood clotting and corrodes muscle tissue and can kill people. Unusually for vipers, P. mangshanensis is oviparous with the female laying clutches of 13 - 21 eggs which she will guard until they hatch.  Description  The species reaches an adult weight of and a length of up to . Geographic range The species is known from the type locality: \\"Pingkeng, Mangshan (Mt. Mang), Yizhang County, Hunan\\", as well as from Ruyuan Yao Autonomous County in Guangdong province, both in southern China. Conservation status This species is listed as \\"Endangered\\" by the IUCN on the basis that this species has an extent of occurrence and area of occupancy both unlikely to exceed , it is known from two locations at risk from harvesting for the international pet trade and as a local delicacy, and there is a continuing decline in the number of mature individuals. Habitat thumb This pitviper is found in mountainous regions in southern Hunan and northern Guangdong at elevations of 2,620 - 4,270 ft (800 - 1,300 m) asl. Although first discovered in the Mt. Mang mountain range, it is also found in surrounding areas, primarily in subtropical montane forest with thick vegetation and cover. It is often found lying along lichen-covered logs and other structures along animal trails to ambush prey, and can also be found in the numerous limestone caves in the region. Winter temperatures in the region come close to freezing, whilst summer temperatures can reach or higher. Taxonomy This species was originally described in the genus Trimeresurus. A new genus, Ermia, named in honor of Chinese herpetologist Zhao Ermi, was erected for the species in 1993.Zhang F.-J. (1993), Division of the genus Trimeresurus (sensu lato) (Serpentes: Viperidae), based on the morphology of their skulls,‚Äù in: E.-M. Zhao, B.-H. Chen, and T. J. Papenfuss (eds.), Proc. of the First Asian Herpetol. Meeting, Huangshan, China. Forestry Press. Beijing. pp. 48 ‚Äì 57. However, by coincidence, this generic name was already in use for a genus of locusts. The new generic name Zhaoermia was therefore proposed as a replacement name for Ermia.Gumprecht A, Tillack F. 2004. Proposal for a replacement name of the snake genus Ermia Zhang, 1993. Russ. J.

Even in the best laboratory conditions, dissociative recombination is hard to observe, but is an important reaction in systems that have large populations of ionized molecules, for instance in atmospheric-pressure plasmas. In astrophysics, dissociative recombination is one of the main paths via which molecules are broken down, and other molecules are formed.

It is used to aid in the prevention of, as well as speed the recovery from canker sores, denture irritation, orthodontic irritation, and oral injuries or after dental procedures. It is distributed in a powdered form that requires reconstitution with warm water, after which it is used as a mouth rinse. It is customarily packaged in 1.7g envelopes.

History Ghetto Ruff came to be in the late 1980s when Lance Stehr (current Managing Director of the label) formed the Cape Town-based hip hop group, Prophets of Da City. POC did extremely well in South Africa as well as internationally. In many ways POC enabled Stehr to expand and grow the label into the premiere kwaito label in South Africa today. South Africa's R&B; star Ishmael was born out of POC and in 1996 he helped Ghetto Ruff Records enter the kwaito genre when the group Skeem was formed, another splinter group of POC was the acclaimed Afrikaans hip hop group Brasse Vannie Kaap. With this foundation, Stehr was able to discover and nurture most probably the most artists from an independent label resulting in hundreds of thousands of record sales over the year. Stehr also produced the sound track for YIZO YIZO, TSOTSI (OSCAR WINNER), and went on to TV to do JOZI - MOVING THE CITY, FLY CHIX and SKYROOM LIVE.

The special is hosted by The Cat in the Hat, who introduces animated adaptations of the Dr. Seuss stories The Sneetches, The Zax and Green Eggs and Ham. Allan Sherman reprised his role as the voice of The Cat in the Hat from the 1971 television special. Dr. Seuss on the Loose was Sherman's final project; he died about one month after the program's original broadcast. The special was titled Green Eggs and Ham and Other Stories for the sing-a-long videocassette release and the deluxe edition releases.  Plot  = The Sneetches = The first story in the collection tells of a group of yellow bird-like creatures called the Sneetches, some of whom have a green star on their bellies. At the beginning of the story, Sneetches with stars discriminate against and shun those without. An entrepreneur named Sylvester McMonkey McBean (calling himself the Fix-It-Up Chappie) appears and offers the Sneetches without stars the chance to get them with his Star-On machine, for three dollars. The treatment is instantly popular, but this upsets the original star-bellied Sneetches, as they are in danger of losing their special status. McBean then tells them about his Star- Off machine, costing ten dollars, and the Sneetches who originally had stars happily pay the money to have them removed in order to remain special. However, McBean does not share the prejudices of the Sneetches and allows the recently starred Sneetches through this machine as well. Ultimately this escalates, with the Sneetches running from one machine to the next... : \\"...until neither the Plain nor the Star-Bellies knew : whether this one was that one... or that one was this one... : or which one was what one... or what one was who.\\" This continues until the Sneetches are penniless and McBean departs as a rich man, amused by their folly. Despite his assertion that \\"you can't teach a Sneetch\\", the Sneetches learn from this experience that neither plain-belly nor star-belly Sneetches are superior, and they are able to get along and become friends. = The Zax = In The Zax, a North-going Zax and a South-going Zax meet face to face on the Prairie of Prax. Each asks the other to make way, but neither budges, saying it is against their upbringing to move any other way. Because they stubbornly refuse to move (east, west, or any direction except their respective headings) to get past each other, the two Zax then face off against each other with their arms crossed. The Zax stand so long that eventually, they realize that the world didn't stand still, and a highway overpass is built around them. The story ends with the Zax still standing there \\"unbudged\\" in their tracks. = Green Eggs and Ham = In Green Eggs and Ham, Sam-I-Am pesters his friend Guy-Am-I to eat a plate of green eggs and ham. However, Guy refuses while responding, \\"I do not like green eggs and ham. I do not like them, Sam-I-Am.\\" He repeats similar responses all throughout the story while Sam persistently follows him, asking him to eat them in eight locations (House, box, car, tree, train, rain, and boat) and with three animals (Mouse, fox and goat), but Guy still refuses, saying, ‚ÄúI do not like them here or there. I do not like them anywhere!‚Äù Finally, in exasperation, he vainly accepts the offer, samples the green eggs and ham, happily announcing he would eat them anywhere and with anyone, and ends the story, saying, ‚ÄúI do so like green eggs and ham.

When referring to woodwork or cabinet shops, pipe clamps are usually composed of commercially manufactured clamp heads or \\"jaws\\" and a length of common threaded pipe. The capacity of the clamp is determined by the length of the pipe used. When referring to piping, pipe clamps are used to connect the pipe to the pipe hanger assembly. Description In woodwork, a pipe clamp uses clamp heads produced commercially by numerous manufacturers. They are available in various diameter sizes, commonly ¬Ω‚Äùor ¬æ‚Äù, suited to the same diameter piping. The pipe is usually threaded on both ends. One head is fixed on the pipe by spinning it onto standard pipe threads. This head includes the screw mechanism for tightening the clamp. The other, movable, head slides onto the other end of the pipe. This head has a mechanism, often a series of movable ‚Äúclutches‚Äù which allow it to slide along the pipe when setting up the clamping operation but which lock onto the pipe when clamping pressure is applied. Pipe clamps serve a similar purpose to bar clamps but are generally less expensive to purchase and have a versatility derived from the ability to use a variety of lengths of pipe to suit one's needs. The same clamp heads might be switched over from a two-foot length of pipe to a twelve-foot length as the project at hand dictates. Having threads at both ends of the pipe also allows the use of pipe couplings, joining two lengths of pipe to extend the length of the clamp. In piping, a pipe clamp is a bottled attachment that clamps around the pipe. The clamps can be manufactured with black or galvanized finishes. Uses Pipe clamps being used to glue up a wooden lamination A common use of pipe clamps in woodworking is for edge gluing; several boards being joined edge to edge to produce a wider surface such as a table top or cabinet components. In this case several pipe clamps will be set up on the workbench so that clamping pressure can be applied evenly along the length of the boards being joined. Pipe clamps can be used to assemble the four sides of boxes or cabinets. As with most other forms of clamps, a wide variety of uses might be found.

They started out as a side-project of fellow Trondheimers, Motorpsycho, who decided to record a country-album when their drummer, H√•kon Gebhardt, bought a banjo. Their line-up got extended (see below) and the story had its beginning. The first album was released (and subsequently became a rarity, as it was pressed in low amounts) and the band played several concerts. Later on, the International Tussler Society, as the project was named, developed a life of its own, aside from the Motorpsycho- universe. Despite the long gaps between recordings and tours, the band can still be seen as standing on its own feet. They derive their musical style from Country/Southern rock-veterans such as The Byrds, The Grateful Dead, The International Submarine Band, The Band, The Allman Brothers Band, Neil Young and The Flying Burrito Brothers. Like the Grateful Dead and the Allman Brothers Band, they also have two drummers since 2003, when Even Gran√•s joined them. They are also known for playing very long sets which include intense jamming, most of the 2004 tour-concerts lasted around three hours.

It is a sequel to Gateway (1977) and Beyond the Blue Event Horizon (1981) and is set about three decades after Gateway. It has been cataloged as the third book in a six-book series called Heechee or The Heechee Saga (the Heechee are a fictional alien race that use advanced technology, created by Pohl) but Kirkus reviewed it as completing a trilogy and a German-language edition of the three books was published as the Gateway trilogy (Die Gateway-Trilogie, Munich: Heyne Verlag, 2004) after all six were out. Plot  Robinette Broadhead, a married millionaire with health problems, returns in this novel. Even with his need for medical care, Broadhead does not feel that he deserves transplants to keep him alive, as he is still feeling guilty about his horrible journey to a black hole many years ago. He still attempts to research more about the advanced alien Heechees and their star-travelling technology. At the same time, a madman named Wan attempts to search for his father within black holes, using stolen equipment and a Heechee ship. Wan's probing is noticed by a sentient race of slow-moving creatures who inform a Heechee patrol that is sent out of their black hole to observe the galaxy. Fearing that humans may alert a malevolent race of beings known as the Assassins, the Heechee patrol tries to find out more about human achievements in space flight and whether or not the damage done by them can be undone. Wan's probing also releases Gelle- Klara Moynlin from her two decade-long entrapment. Moynlin was a companion of Robinette on his journey to the black hole, which Moynlin experienced as only several elapsed days. The journeys of these past and future friends of Robinette begin to converge, and in the end, humans finally meet the Heechee race. Reception Dave Langford reviewed Heechee Rendezvous for White Dwarf #57, and stated that \\"The ending's less than perfect, with some problems ignored rather than confronted, but Heechee Rendezvous completes a worthy trilogy.\\" Readers of Locus ranked Heechee Rendezvous third in the 1985 poll to confer the annual Locus Award for Best SF Novel.

The eastern terminus of SR 68 is at an intersection with North Fourth Street (US 1-SR 5); the roadway continues east a short distance towards Indian River Drive (County Road 707) in downtown Fort Pierce without state or county designation. The western terminus is with Kings Highway (SR 713), just west of Interstate 95 (SR 9). West of Kings Highway, Orange Avenue transitions into County Road 68, heading west for another , maintaining the CR 68 designation as it crosses into Okeechobee County before ending at an intersection with US 441. Initially a key road in the citrus industry, SR 68 has since become an important commuter road providing the residences of central Fort Pierce with access to Interstate 95 (SR 9) 0.3 miles east of SR 713. The rural nature of the western end of SR 68 is slowly giving way to urbanization, a trend throughout the Atlantic coast of the State of Florida, as orange groves are gradually being replaced by residential developments. History The historic western terminus of State Road 68 is about west of the current one. Originally, SR 68 extended from Micco Bluff Road in Okeechobee County west of Basinger near the Kissimmee River, following US 98-SR 700, Northeast 160th Street (present County Road 68), Parrott Avenue (US 441-SR 15), Northeast 224th Street (present County Road 68), and the aptly named Orange Avenue (present County Road 68) to SR 713 as it cuts across the wetlands and the orange groves of central Florida to Fort Pierce. All portions of SR 68 in Okeechobee County as well as the portion from the St. Lucie County east to Kings Highway were transferred to county control in the mid-1980s. In the late 1990s, the alignment of SR 68 immediately west of US1 was changed - Orange Avenue between N 7th Street and US1 was made into an eastbound one-way road, carrying SR 68 along its 2 lanes towards US1; westbound SR 68 was rerouted one block north of Orange Avenue along Avenue A. From US1, Avenue A headed west as a 4-lane one-way street for two blocks before ending at N 7th Street. Traffic wishing to follow SR 68 west were forced to turn left onto N 7th Street, then immediately turn right one block later onto Orange Avenue and SR 68 west. A few years later, in the late 2000s, Orange Avenue between N 7th Street and US1 was restored to two-way traffic, ending the ill-advised and short-lived Avenue A and N 7th Street's SR 68 designation.

This work was written at the request and with the patronage of Matilda, a half-sister of Roger and, from 1131, estranged wife of Ranulf II, Count of Alife. It covers only the years after 1127 in detail, ending abruptly in 1136. Though written for the sister of Roger and wife of his chiefest enemy, it was definitely sympathetic to Roger.

Early life and education Clendinnen was born in Geelong, Victoria, in 1934. She was the youngest of four children. Her father owned a cabinet-making business and later became a Geelong City Councillor; her mother was a homemaker. Clendinnen graduated from the University of Melbourne in 1955 with a Bachelor of Arts with Honours, followed by a Master of Arts in 1975. Career Clendinnen's work focused on social history, and the history of cultural encounters. She was considered an authority on Aztec civilisation and pre-Columbian ritual human sacrifice.Nicolas Rothwell, \\"That's not all, Volk\\", The Weekend Australian, 26‚Äì27 September 1998, Review, p. 14 She also wrote on the Holocaust, and on first contacts between Indigenous Australians and white explorers. Clendinnen held the post of senior tutor of History at the University of Melbourne from 1955 to 1968, was a lecturer at La Trobe University from 1969 to 1982, and was then a senior lecturer in History until 1989. Forced to curtail her academic activities after contracting hepatitis in 1991, Clendinnen began working on her memoir, Tiger's Eye, which focused on issues of illness and death. She retained an association with La Trobe University, however, as she was appointed Emeritus Scholar. In 1999, she was invited to present the 40th annual Boyer Lectures. The ideas presented in these lectures, concerning first contacts in Australia, were later published as True Stories.

It was directed by Jacques Tourneur and Mario Bava. It starred Steve Reeves as Phillipides. The film was a co-production between Italy's Titanus and Galatea Film and France's Lux Compagnie Cinematographique de France and Societe Cinematographique Lyre. Plot The story is set in 490 BC, the time of the Medic Wars, during which Persian armies sweep through the Ancient world. Having brought home to Athens the Olympic victor's laurel crown, Phillippides becomes commander of the Sacred Guard, which is expected to defend the city-state's liberty, a year after the expulsion of the tyrant Hippias. Athenian supporters of Hippias conspire, hoping to sideline Phillippides with a marriage to Theocrites' expensive servant Charis, and thus neutralize the guard. She fails to seduce him, as his heart is already taken by a young girl before he learns her name is Andromeda, daughter of Creuso. Everything personal is likely to be put on hold when the news breaks that the vast army of Darius, the Persian King of Kings, is marching on Greece, hoping that its internal division will make its conquest a walk-over. Theocrites instructs Miltiades to hold back the Sacred Guard to defend the temple of Pallas after a likely defeat, and proposes instead to negotiate terms with Darius, but is told an alliance with Sparta could save the Hellenic nation. Phillippides makes the journey and survives an attempt on his life by conspirators; he returns with Sparta's engagement during the Persian attack in far greater numbers on Militiades valiant troops. Charis, left for dead after overhearing Darius's orders, reaches the camp to tell that the Persian fleet, now commanded by the traitor Theocrites, is heading for the Piraeus to take Athens. Miltiades sends Phillippides ahead to hold out with the Sacred Guard until his hopefully victorious troops arrive, and after his perilous journey back they successfully beat back the Persians. Cast Production The Giant of Marathon was shot on location in Italy. Ten days before the premiere, director Mario Bava was forced to reshoot exterior scenes because several extras were spotted smoking cigarettes on camera.Hughes, p.49 Release In Italy, the film was released on 3 December 1959. The film was dubbed into English for its North American release. This release included several underwater scenes of the sacred guard planting spikes in coral and fighting alongside Persian ships. The film opened in Los Angeles on 20 May 1960 and in New York on 25 May 1960. The film was released in the US as Giant of Marathon and everywhere else as Battle of Marathon.Della Casa, Steve; Giusti, Marco (2013). \\"Il Grande Libro di Ercole\\". Edizione Sabinae. Page 103. The film was very successful at the box office: according to MGM records the film earned $1,335,000 in the US and Canada and $1.4 million elsewhere resulting in a profit of $429,000..

Lethem adapted the novel from several unpublished short stories he had written, all about catastrophic, apocalyptic events. In finished form Amnesia Moon bears homage to Philip K. Dick. In fact, during a party scene, one guest describes a battle of wills in West Marin, clearly a reference to Dick's Dr. Bloodmoney, or How We Got Along After the Bomb. One character even cites a West Marin inhabitant named \\"Hoppington\\", evocative of the mutant telepath Hoppy Harrington in the latter book.  Plot  The protagonist is a survivalist named Chaos, who lives in an abandoned megaplex in Wyoming after an apparent nuclear strike. The residents of his town of Hatfork are reliant on a sinister messianic figure named Kellogg for food. Kellogg also has powerful dreams, which he transfers into the minds of others. Chaos's mind is especially receptive, making him reluctant to sleep. Both Lethem and Chaos abandon this premise early on, and Chaos also goes by the name of \\"Everett Moon\\", depending on where he is. The novel plays with several other dystopian and post-apocalyptic setups. One area is covered in a thick green fog, save for an exclusive private school. Vacaville, California, has converted to a luck-based social system, taken to totalitarian extremes. Again, this is reminiscent of Dick's Solar Lottery, where society is also based on chance. There are echoes of other works by Dick. For example, when Moon and his travelling companion, Melinda, reach San Francisco, hallucinogenic drugs play a role in altered perceptions that provide access to other characters in this world, as in The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. Elsewhere, it is argued that the depicted realities splintered away from each other to provide resistance to a hive-like alien invasion of Earth. Such solipsistic worlds are reminiscent of Dick's early novel Eye in the Sky. The one constant throughout is the idea that reality is shaped by powerful and charismatic \\"dreamers\\". The reason for the break in realities, and Chaos/Moon's place in this world, is a unifying mystery.

Anderson, Black Patie: the Life and Times of Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, Lord of Zetland (Edinburgh, 1992), 148-49. ‚Äì 6 February 1615) was a Scottish nobleman, the son of Robert, Earl of Orkney, a bastard son of King James V. Infamous for his godless nature and tyrannical rule over the Scottish archipelagos of Orkney and Shetland, he was executed for treason in 1615. Career Patrick was the second of five sons born to Earl Robert and his wife Lady Jean Kennedy. On the death of his uncle Lord Robert in 1581, he was given the gift of the Priory of Whithorn.Register of the Privy Seal, vol. 8, (1982), 485, no. 2742. On the death of his elder brother Henry around 1588, he became heir to the Earldom of Orkney. In his youth Patrick was a good friend of his cousin James VI; however, their relationship became strained in the 1590s after Patrick succeeded his father as Earl of Orkney. In June 1589 he wrote from Kirkwall to Patrick Vans of Barnbarroch with news of a pirate called Peterson who claimed to have a letter from Earl Robert to the Duke of Parma. Such a letter would be compromising to them, and Patrick hoped Barnbarroch could investigate and mitigate any danger to them.Robert Vans Agnew, Correspondence of Sir Patrick Waus of Barnbarroch, vol. 2 (Edinburgh, 1887), pp. 433-4. An early example of his rapacity occurs in 1594, when he was accused of spoiling a Danzig ship; however he was absolved of this crime.Balfour Paul, Sir James, in The Scots Peerage, Volume VI (Edinburgh, 1909), pp. 575-7 The same year he accused three of his younger brothers of conspiring to kill him, after he caught one of John's servitors with poison on him. The servitor was tortured and executed, along with Allison Balfour, a \\"witch\\" who supposedly aided in the conspiracy; the brothers, however, were later acquitted.Steuart, Archibald, in The Scots Peerage, Volume II (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 440-1 The ruins of the Earl's Palace Patrick became a prominent figure at Court, and served as a \\"sewer\\" (assistant) to the King at the baptism of his son Prince Henry Frederick in 1594. He ruled Orkney and Shetland in the north of Scotland in the manner of an independent sovereign, severely oppressing the islanders and getting into massive debt. In 1599 he built Scalloway Castle on the Mainland of Shetland, partly to strengthen his power there against his half-uncle Laurence Bruce, who had been appointed Sheriff of Shetland by the deceased Earl Robert. Patrick also feuded with George Sinclair, the Earl of nearby Caithness. In March 1599, James VI ordered Patrick and George to furnish their strongholds against the possibility of an invasion by the exiled Earl of Bothwell. This scare was renewed in July 1601. In 1607 Earl Patrick began the construction of the Earl's Palace in Kirkwall, the capital of Orkney. Patrick joined the King in a hunting trip in Teviotdale in the Scottish borders in March 1600. The hunting party was shadowed by an agent of the English border warden, who noted the Earl's presence.HMC, Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol.10 (1910), 47 Earl Patrick's financial mismanagement and his brutality against the local population led to him being summoned before the Privy Council in 1609, and then imprisoned, firstly in Edinburgh Castle and then in Dumbarton Castle. Rebellion and death After Earl Patrick's imprisonment, he sent his illegitimate son Robert Stewart to raise a rebellion in Orkney in his favour. Robert seized the Palace of Birsay with thirty companions in May 1614, then occupied the Earl's Palace, the castle and St Magnus' Cathedral in Kirkwall. As many as 700 rebels subscribed to a band which claimed their action was restoring royal justice in Orkney under the direction of Robert Stewart during the Earl's absence. Robert was defeated by a force commanded by the Earl of Caithness at the end of September, after a five-week siege of the Earl's Palace. The Earl of Caithness battered the Palace with 140 cannon shot; he said the castle was so strong that some of his cannonballs broke in two like golf balls. Twelve of Robert's men were hanged at the castle gate. Robert was taken to Edinburgh, put on trial, and hanged with five others. Robert and his father denied they had planned the rebellion together, but Robert's accomplice, Patrick Halcro, insisted he had acted on Earl Patrick's instructions. Evidence was taken in Orkney from Margaret Buchanan, a servant who claimed she had read instructions for Halcro written by the Earl. She said that Halcro showed the paper to Robert, who tore it into pieces and they both told her it were better so, that it could do no hurt in time coming, and \\"the Earl of Orkney should not want his head for it\\".Ancient Criminal Trials, vol.3 issue 1, (1833), 272-308 Robert's execution evoked much sympathy from the people, owing to his young age, around twenty-two, and his \\"tall stature and comlie countenance\\". The trial of Earl Patrick followed that of his son. His titles were forfeited and he was sentenced to death, but his execution was postponed after a plea from the chaplains, who, finding him so ignorant he could barely recite the Lord's Prayer, wanted time to educate him and give him Communion. The execution eventually took place on 6 February 1615, when he was taken to the Market Cross in Edinburgh and beheaded. Marriage and marriage plan In 1595 King James suggested the Earl's marriage to Emilia, a sister of Count Maurice of Nassau. An envoy, Colonel Stewart, proposed the plan to the States to cement a league between Scotland and the Netherlands, but objections included the Earl's doubtful title to Orkney and Shetland, and that Emilia was unwilling to dwell so far from her home and family. Patrick had partly funded the Colonel's mission, which was resented by the Scottish resident ambassador-lieger and consul to the States General, Robert Deniston.HMC, Calendar of the Manuscripts of the Marquis of Salisbury at Hatfield House, vol.5 (1894), 110, 111, 167: CSP Scotland, vol. 11 (1936), p. 498. Patrick instead married Margaret Livingstone, the wealthy widow of Sir Lewis Bellenden and a daughter of the Lord Livingston and Agnes Fleming on 19 August 1596. Margaret was a gentlewoman in households of Anne of Denmark and Prince Henry. After squandering her fortune, Patrick left her to die in poverty. They had no children, though Patrick did have several bastards: *Robert Stewart, son of Marjorie Sinclair (who was present with her son at the siege of Kirkwall and was wounded in the hand) *Mary Stewart *Catherine Stewart, married John Sinclair of Ulbster Ancestry References Notes Citations Sources * Balfour, David, ed., Oppressions of the sixteenth century in Orkney & Zetland from original documents, Edinburgh (1859) * Pitcairn, Robert, ed., Ancient Criminal Trials, vol.3 issue 1, (1833), pp. 272‚Äì327.

It has seen three major movements, the Revolution of 1951, Jana Andolan and Loktantra Andolan (Nepali: ‡§≤‡•ã‡§ï‡§§‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡•ç‡§∞ ‡§Ü‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•ã‡§≤‡§®, romanized: Loktantra ƒÄndolan) which ultimately abolished the Shah monarchy, transitioned Nepal towards a republic and reintroduced multi-party bicameral democracy. The beginning of a national movement for democracy in Nepal was the ousting of the Ranas, the long-established Nepalese royal family, in the mid-20th century which was influenced by ethnic and political developments from the Indian nationalist movement. However, this period of democracy ended in 1960 and the Panchayat system of government was introduced, abolishing recent democratic institutions, banning political parties and restricting some forms of freedom of speech. Student protests in 1979 led to a referendum on the direction of the political system resulted in minor adaptations to the existing party-less system, at times increasing executive control over the opposition. A period of economic disputes with India and mounting repression in Nepal led to the Jana Andolan popular movement resulting in the re-establishment of multi-party democracy under a constitutional monarchy framework. Until 2001, the economic and political situation progressed despite corruption, nepotism and the presence of a Maoist insurgency which developed into a nation-wide civil war between the Maoist insurgents and the Government of Nepal. Following the assassination of the Nepalese royal family, King Gyanendra took control of the government and ruled until 2006 through emergency powers enforcing nation-wide oppression of media and civil society. Widespread protests headed by a coalition of seven Nepalese Parties alongside the Maoists led to the resignation of the King and the reinstation of the Parliament, the abolishment of monarchy and transitioned Nepal towards a federal republic, marking an end to the country's civil war.  Rana dynasty and colonisation  Jung Bahadur Kunwar320x320px As one of the regions oldest nation-states, Nepal was unified by the Shah Dynasty and has since been ruled by the Rana royal family after a coup d'√©tat that installed Jung Bahadur Kunwar as prime minister, and later Maharaja of Kaski and Lamjung. During the 19th century, Nepal's expansionist aspirations came in conflict with the British Empire and the British East India Company culminating in the Anglo-Nepalese War of 1814-16. Sugauli Treaty and its effect on Nepalese territory The war eventually concluded with the Treaty of Sugauli on 4 March 1816 which defined Nepal's current territorial boundaries. The treaty therefore spared Nepal of colonisation similar to that of neighbouring countries. Throughout the Shah dynasty Nepali society underwent a period of Sanskritisation which established the political, economic and cultural dominance of high-caste Indo-Aryans, most notably the Bahuns and Chhetri caste who established Khas Kura, later known as Nepali, as the official state language.  Democracy movement of 1951  The mid-20th century saw the emergence of an educated elite in Nepal due to an expansion of the country's education system leading to much increased literacy rates and rising levels of higher education attainment in the country. After India's independence, political parties were established and engaged an organised struggle against the Rana monarchy in neighbouring Nepal. The Nepal Communist Party was founded in 1949 with the goal to set up a democracy and People's Republic. Conversely, the Nepali Congress Party, later Nepali Congress, was formed in 1947 and gained support from the Nepal Communist Party to stage an armed revolution against the Rana monarchy. Under significant international and domestic pressure, the royal family and the Nepali Congress agreed to institute a peaceful and stable transition of democracy regarded as the Delhi Compromise of 1951. A transitional government was instituted with in a constitutional monarchy framework, and elections won by the Nepali Congress Party which was instrumental in abolishing the Rana regime and ran on a social-democratic basis. In December 1960 King Mahendra dissolved the parliament and devised a ban on political parties and police jailed members of political parties and members of the national cabinet.  Panchayat era  King Mahendra and Queen Ratna of Nepal in 1957 The King introduced the Panchayat system of governance which restructured political power to the King elections to holding direct elections at a communal level. While Panchayat legislation formally guaranteed freedom of speech, it was restricted through a number of royal laws, including l√®se-majest√© legislation which prohibited critique of the royal family. The political reforms restructured and curtailed the parliament's autonomy and authority as the King held executive power. Political representatives were strictly monitored on their loyalty to the monarch, and political representation held narrow. Popular discontent mounted in 1979 in student protests leading to a referendum on the future of the Panchayat system which resulted in the preservation of the Panchayat system with minor institutional reforms.  Jana Andolan 1990  Following a trade dispute with India that resulted in price hikes and shortages of consumer goods a coalition of seven political factions and the Nepali Congress lead a process of reintroduction of democracy in Nepal. In April 1990, students, human rights organisations and professional unions staged protests which led to the closure of universities and schools. The protests culminated in the first Jana Andolan, or People's Movement which pressured the King to reinstate multi-party democracy in the framework of a constitutional democracy. Its constitution declared Nepal as a Hindu state with Khasa-Nepali as the official language despite Nepal's poly-religious and linguistic population. The restoration of democracy in Nepal solidified a shift to neoliberal government policies that promoted economic liberalisation such as the removal of price controls, privatisation and introduction of convertibility for the domestic currency.  Nepalese civil war  Communist graffiti in Kathmandu. It reads: \\"Long Live Marxism-Leninism-Maoism and Prachanda Path!\\" The Nepalese civil war, or People‚Äôs War, was the result of stalled peace negotiations between the democratic government and the paramilitary wing of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist). It resulted in a build-up of around 30,000 insurgency fighters and caused approximately 13,000 casualties with thousands unaccounted for. Nepal's first decade of democracy is considered turbulent due to frequent government changes, internal party battles and corruption. Politics continued to be dominated by the Brahmin and Chhetri castes with an underrepresentation of ethnic minorities and women. After the transition to the constitutional monarchy in 1991 Nepal remained one of the least developed countries, situated at 113 out of 130 countries in Human Development Index. General elections in 1999 produced a victory for the Nepali Congress, ushering in 4 years of political stability. The dissolution of the House of Representatives for the 1994 mid-term election led to a hung parliament producing 8 unstable coalition governments within 5 years. Following a split in the United People's Front into the rcognised and unrecognised wing, led by Puspa Kamal Dahal, elections were boycotted, and armed rebellion was instigated. The government was presented with demands to institutionalise Nepal as a federal republic, therefore abolishing monarchy, formation of an interim government and the establishment of a constituent assembly. On the 13 February 1996 the People‚Äôs War was declared in response to the perceived government failure to honour the insurgent's demands. On 1 June 2001 the royal family was murdered, triggering the crowning of Gyanendra as king. On 25 November 2001 a truce between the Maoist insurgents and the government broke following an increase in violent attacks against the police and army. This triggered the declaration of a national emergency and the passage of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Control and Punishment) Ordinance (TADO). TADO declared the Maoists as terrorists and deployed the Royal Nepalese Army against them. alt= Following political confrontations between members of the House of Representatives and King Gyanendra, several constitution articles were suspended, especially ones relating to freedom of speech, expression, press, movement and rights to peaceful protest. The then prime minister Deuba‚Äôs government stayed in office and ruled through government decrees until dismissed by Gyanendra due to a perceived inability to hold elections and quell the Maoist insurgency. Deuba was replaced by Lokendra Bahadur, a former Panchayat politician and Nepalese royalist who failed to negotiate a peace deal with the Maoists and faced the rise of a popular pro-democracy movement joined by major Nepali political parties, including the Nepali Congress, Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) (UML), Rashtriya Prajatantra Party, Nepal Congress Party (Democratic), United Left Front, Nepal Workers and Peasants Party. After the reappointment of Deuba as prime minister the Nepali Congress (Democratic), UML and Rashtriya Prajatantra Party left the civil movement and joined the government. The TADO legislation was further renewed and has contributed to Nepal‚Äôs record numbers of unexplained forced disappearances in 2002 and 2003 (Malagodi 2013, p. 187). Following a brief period of political stability, King Gyanendra dismissed the Deuba government and assumed full executive control over the country through the declaration of a State of Emergency under the laws of the 1990 Constitution.  Loktantra Andolan  thumb In 1996 the Maoist insurgency launched a violent campaign to overthrow the political- economic status quo, redistribute land and affect a ‚Äòproletarian revolution‚Äô in Nepal. The ensuing civil war caused human rights violations and killings of more than 13,000, as well as a decline in Nepal's GDP growth rate, fuelled by a drop in tourist arrivals and the destruction of infrastructure. Following the assassination of King Birendra and his family in 2001 by Maoist insurgents, the multi-party democracy was placed under a State of Emergency by the preceding King, tightly controlling the opposition, censoring news and media organisations, and shutting down telecommunications in parts of the country. The civil war developed into a military and political stalemate that ended in 2005. Protests against the political and economic situation drew an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 in Nepal's capital Kathmandu and 5 million in the entire country. An alliance of seven political parties developed a coalition government, abolished the monarchy and signed a peace agreement with Maoist insurgents in 2006. This was achieved through cooperation between main-stream political parties and the Maoist insurgency facilitated though a 12-point agreement which outlined the democratic framework to be instituted after the abolition of monarchy. This framework set out the formation of an internationally monitored interim government, holding free and fair elections in a system of governance which guarantees civil, political and human rights, as well as the rule of law. Furthermore, the Constitution was redrafted to: # remove the right and role of the monarch; # shift executive power to the Council of Ministers of the incumbent government therefore abolishing of the Raj Parishad, the royal advisory body; # remove terms that referred to the monarch as the leader of Nepal, such as \\"his majesty's government\\"; # establish accountability for the Council of Ministers through the House of Representatives; # bring all executive organs of government, such as police, army and administration under the influence of the republican government; # compel the king to pay taxes on fortunes and estates; # integrate the Palace Service into the state civil service; # declare Nepal as a federal republic; # declare Nepal as a secular state; The Royal Nepalese Army has been accused of suppressing the demonstrations with an unproportional use of force leading to a high-level investigation into law enforcement brutality towards the 2006 protests. After the release of the Rayamajhi Commission the government implemented its recommendations and dismissed the chiefs of Nepal's police organisations.International Commission of Jurists (2012), \\"Commissions of Inquiry in Nepal: Denying Remedies, Entrenching Impunity\\", accessed 29 May 2020, http://icj.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/06/Nepal- Commissions-of-Inquiry-thematic-report-2012.pdf Following elections in 2008, the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist‚ÄìLeninist) won 38% of the votes contrary to international predictions.

They issued it only in the $10 denomination, depicting Benjamin Franklin. Their issuance reflects the end of a coin- hoarding period that began during the American Civil War, and represented a return to public confidence in paper money. When the Treasury issued the bonds, silver coins were in wide circulation and gold coins were just beginning to appear at banks nationwide. The Treasury paid out $40,012,750 in notes, the majority‚Äî$39,398,110 (or 98.5%)‚Äîin the fourth quarter of 1879, as long lines of people gathered at Post Office branches and Treasury offices. The Refunding Certificate originally promised to pay 4% annual interest in perpetuity. The obligation on these notes reads: :\\"This certifies that the sum of Ten Dollars has been deposited with the Treasurer of the United States under Act of February 26th, 1879 convertible with accrued interest at 4 per cent per annum into 4 per cent bonds of the United States issued under the Acts of July 14, 1870 and January 20, 1871 upon presentation at the office of the Treasurer of the U.S. in sums of $50. Or multiples thereof.\\" However, in 1907, Congress passed an act that ended the interest accrual of the certificates, and fixed the value of them at $21.30, over twice their face value. By January 1, 1885, all but $260,000 (99.4%) in face value had been redeemed, and since that time most others have met the same fate. Consistent with the Treasury Department paper used in printing the Fourth and Fifth Issues of Fractional currency (1869‚Äì76), anti-counterfeiting devices of the period included embedding large silk fibers as well as the use of blue tinted paper.Kravitz, 2012, pp. 40‚Äì41.Blake, 1908, p. 39.

It offers classes for students from Form 1 to Form 6. Since 1994, the school changed it status from a boys school to a co-ed secondary school. It was situated on Jalan Cochrane before the school was relocated to a new building in Jalan Shahbandar in late 2004. The school was renamed to SMK Cochrane as it is no longer situated on Jalan Cochrane. The new school building was official opened on 4 February 2005 by Dato' Seri Hishammuddin Hussein, Minister of Education. The school, like the road it was once situated on before, was named after the 17th British Resident of Perak, Charles Walter Hamilton Cochrane. The old structure on Jalan Cochrane is now called the Cochrane Youth Sports Centre dedicated to the development of young talented sportsmen. The move received many objections initially as many old boys of the school firmly believe that the location of the school and the huge football field that surrounded it embodied the true spirit of the education institution.Debbie Chan (6 October 2007).

Truman; he served under Oscar R. Ewing on an \\"unofficial policy group\\" within the Truman administration (1947‚Äì1952). Background Mordechai Lowenthal was born on February 26, 1888, in Minneapolis, Minnesota. In the 1870s, his parents Nathan (Naphtali) Lowenthal and Gertrude (Nahamah) Gitel, Orthodox Jewish, emigrated from Kovno (now Kaunas), Lithuania, to Minnesota. At a young age, he started using the more \\"American\\" name of Max. He had two older siblings, of whom only one survived childhood. He graduated from North High School in 1905, first in his class. He also attended Talmud Torah, where he learned Hebrew. He received a BA in 1909 from the University of Minnesota and graduated in 1912 from Harvard Law School, where he began a lifelong friendship with Felix Frankfurter. Career Many of Lowenthal's accomplishments are presumed unknown as some are being discovered through historical research. Lowenthal had an incredibly discreet personality and often refused to take credit for his accomplishments. A memo in Lowenthal's FBI file reveals the following chronology (supplemented): * 1907‚Äì1909: Reporter at Minneapolis Journal * 1912‚Äì1913: Law clerk for Judge Julian Mack at $1,800 per annum * 1913‚Äì1914: Law clerk for Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft (AKA Strong & Cadwalader) at $1,800 per annum * 1915: Starts own law firm in New York City * 1917: Clerk or assistant at U.S. Department of State * 1917‚Äì1918: Assistant secretary to U.S. President Woodrow Wilson's Mediation Commission (Morgenthau Mission, recommended by Felix Frankfurter)) * 1918: Informal aid at U.S. Department of War * 1918‚Äì1919: Assistant chairman for War Labor Policies Board to Felix Frankfurter * 1919‚Äì1920: Returns to private practice; defends Sidney Hillman and Amalgamated Clothing Workers in \\"landmark injunction case\\" * 1920‚Äì1921: Assistant secretary to Second President's Industrial Congress * 1920-1929: Partners in Szold Branwen [sic] law firm and becomes a \\"very wealthy New York lawyer\\" in Lowenthal, Szold and Brandwen of 43 Exchange Place, New York City. (FTC commissioner John J. Carson later mistakenly recalled one partner as \\"Max Bramblin\\" of \\"Lowenthal & Bramblin\\" ) Lowenthal knew Walter Weyl (father of Ware Group member Nathaniel Weyl), who recommended Adelaide Hasse as a researcher for the War Labor Policies Board. =Private law practice= Logo of the Russian-American Industrial Corporation, brainchild of Sidney Hillman. Lowenthal ran a private law practice from 1912 to 1932. Cases involved workers rights, defense of right-to-strike legislation and shareholder rights in receivership cases. In the early 1920s, Lowenthal seems to have had a law office in New York City. While Ann Fagan Ginger does not mention him as a mentor of Carol Weiss King in her biography of King, Ginger does say that King formed a \\"loose partnership\\" with radical attorneys, who included Joseph Brodsky, Swinburne Hale, Walter Nelles, and Isaac Shorr as well as a long-term association with Walter Pollak (once partner of Benjamin Cardozo, whom she met through her brother-in-law Carl Stern. Nevertheless, newspaper accounts of King (in the 1950s) mention Lowenthal as not only an associate but her employer. The Saturday Evening Post went even further in 1951 in a long article on Carol Weiss King: > Lowenthal is of special interest. A product of Harvard Law, he has been > described by a New Deal associate as \\"self-effacing and ubiquitous.\\" > Shuttling between New York and Washington, he has maintained a New York > office while holding a variety of Government posts dating back to World War > I. On one hand, he has been an assiduous cultivator of high-level > friendships, including Presidents Roosevelt and Truman and Supreme Court > Justices Felix Frankfurter and Louis Brandeis. On the other, he has been an > equally assiduous collector of proteges for whom he has found many > Government jobs. Alger Hiss and Lee Pressman benefited by his friendship, > and, for a time, did one George Shaw Wheeler, a young lawyer who became so > carried away by communism that he denounced his United States citizenship to > make a new career bebind the Iron Curtain. Back in 1920, at the time of her > admission to the New York bar, Carol also was a Lowenthal prot√©g√©e, and it > was in his office that she served her first and only legal clerkship. Another important protege of Lowenthal's (and his partner Robert Szold) was Benjamin V. Cohen, later known as one of Felix Frankfurter's Hotdogs in the New Deal. Lowenthal and Cohen both knew Judge Julian W. Mack, who was one of Cohen's professor at Harvard (and was uncle of Lowenthal's wife). In October 1920, Cohen first worked for Lowenthal on a bankruptcy case involving E.F. Drew & Company. In 1923, Lowenthal was general counsel for the Russian- American Industrial Corporation (RAIC) of 31 Union Square, New York City, launched by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers union in 1922, following a 1921 visit to the Soviet Union by union president Sidney Hillman. He was also one of the original directors of the Amalgamated Bank of New York, as advertised in the Liberator magazine. The ad mentions that the bank is owned and operated by the Amalgamated Clothing Workers. It lists chairman Hyman Blumberg, president R. L. Redheffer, vice president Jacob S. Potofsky, cashier Leroy Peterson, and other directors: Hillman, August Bellanca, Joseph Gold, Fiorello H. La Guardia, Abraham Miller, Joseph Schlossberg, Murray Weinstein, Max Zaritzky, and Peter Monat. The Amalgamated relationship seems to have started with Lowenthal defended Hillman in 1920 in a labor dispute in Rocherester, New York. As late as 1929, Lowenthal still had a close relationship with Amalgamated, as after Wall Street Crash of 1929 he recommended that the bank sell its securities for cash; throughout the Great Deparession, the bank held its assets in cash or cash-equivalents. \\"It was the advice of Max Lowenthal that helped more than anything else to keep our banks open during the Hoover banking collapse,\\" Hillman later noted. Advising Lowenthal in this period was Benjamin V. Cohen. =Government service= George Woodward Wickersham. During his early days in politics, Lowenthal served as advisor to several United States senators. In 1929, he served as pro bono secretary on U.S. President Herbert Hoover's National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement (later called the Wickersham Commission) to investigate gang-related crimes and Prohibition enforcement through July 1930, when he resigned. He assisted Ferdinand Pecora with Senate committee hearings investigating the causes of the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The hearings launched a major reform of the American financial system.Moyers, Bill.: Pecora Part II?, \\"Bill Moyers Journal\\", Retrieved April 25, 2009. Around 1930, \\"another job that I was given in connection with the charge that in the Government that men were taking positions in the Government who had private investments,\\" connected (unclearly recounted later by Lowenthal) to his Harvard Law School friend, U.S. Solicitor General Charles Hughes, Jr. (1929‚Äì1930), son of 11th Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Sr. In 1933‚Äì1934, he consulted to the U.S. Senate Banking and Currency Committee. \\"I can't remember that I had worked for any congressional committee before that, but this I would not want to affirm categorically.\\" Railroad reorganization In 1933, Lowenthal began advocating railroad reform by republishing his original Harvard Law Review argument The Railroad Reorganization Act in book form along with a second book, The Investor Pays (1933) (Felix Frankfurter attributed much of the work on The Investor Pays to Benjamin V. Cohen.) Abuses he cited included: control of receivership and of reorganization by owners prior to acknowledgement of insolvency, inadequate administration of properties prior to reorganization, inadequate regulatory supervision, and conflicts of interest. While making rounds \\"as agents of the President\\" with Tommy Corcoran (one of Felix Frankfurter's \\"Happy Hotdogs\\"), Lowenthal told any and all that nothing would happen \\"without the help of railway labor.\\" On July 5, 1935 Federal Coordinator Joseph Bartlett Eastman wrote to Senator Wheeler (committee chair), with Lowenthal as committee counsel, to recommend 18 railroads (including Van Sweringen Lines, Pennsylvania Railroad, Wabash Railway, and Delaware & Hudson Company) plus financiers (J.P. Morgan & Company, and Kuhn, Loeb & Company) for investigation, as reported in the New York Times and Railway Age. Only in December 1936 did Lowenthal manage to obtain enough subpoenaed documentation to begin actual investigation, according to Railway Age. By 1939, the Senate had introduced a \\"Lowenthal Bill\\" to create a special \\"Railroad Reorganization Court\\" for bankrupt railroads and downsizing of capitalization and reduction of fixed charges. In April 1939, ICC commissioner Walter M. W. Splawn and committee counsel Lowenthal testified. Lowenthal explained changes in the new Reorganization Act of 1939 (passed and signed into law on April 3, 1939). Its special court would make for \\"sounder reorganizations\\" thanks to judges trained in railroads. Truman Counsel and chief investigator Max Lowenthal huddles with U.S. Senator and acting chairman Harry S. Truman on the Senate Committee investigating railroad financing, as it resumed its open hearings today, when Senator Truman was presiding for Senator Burton K. Wheeler. In 1935, Lowenthal met Harry S. Truman, after Truman joined a subcommittee of the U.S. Senate Interstate Commerce Committee, investigating railroads and holding companies (which resulted in U.S. Senate Resolution 71 on February 4, 1935. Senator Robert F. Wagner had to withdraw from the subcommittee, and Senator Burton K. Wheeler filled his place with Truman. Senators on that subcommittee included: Wheeler (chair), Truman, Alben Barkley, Victor Donahey, Wallace White, and Henrik Shipstead. Heading the legal counselors for that subcommittee was Telford Taylor, assisted by Lowenthal and Sidney J. Kaplan (who later headed the Claims Division in the Solicitor General's office of the U.S. Department of Justice during World War II, George Rosier, Lucien Hilmer, and John Davis. According to close Truman's Appointments Secretary Matthew J. Connelly, \\"Lowenthal served as counsel for Senator Truman during the hearings on the setting up of the Civil Aeronautics Board.\\" According to daughter Margaret Truman, Truman relied on Lowenthal to keep up pressure on the Missouri Pacific Railroad and Alleghany Corporation over the \\"Alleghany-Missouri Pacific matter.\\" Lowenthal later recollected, \\"Until we went into World War II, I may have been doing some work for the Interstate Commerce Committee. I was for a number of years, in that category which was referred to as dollar-a-year men, but, when we went into the war, I had a talk with Senator Wheeler and suggested that probably I ought to be available on some wartime work, and Chairman Wheeler thought that was right.\\" Thus, Lowenthal did not serve with Truman on the so-called \\"Truman Committee\\" (1941-1944) (formally, the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, 1941-1948, from 1948 the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations or \\"PSI,\\" and current the \\"United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations\\"). \\"I attended one or two hearings out of interest, but I was completing work for the Interstate Commerce Committee at that time and then I was involved in some work in the war effort which was pretty absorbing -- it was day and night work,\\" he later recalled. From 1944 to 1946, Lowenthal left official government service. In 1944, Lowenthal attended the 1944 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. In 1944, Truman wrote to his daughter that Lowenthal, William M. Boyle, and Leslie Biffle \\"were on my trail... Yes, they are plotting against your dad\\" along with many others \\"trying to make him VP against his will.\\" Truman told Lowenthal that FDR had included him on his shortlist of candidates for vice president. Lowenthal went with Truman to meet with Philip Murray, head of the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) union for support. \\"I think that someone in his organizationSince Lowenthal was a legal counselor, his counterparts attending such an important meeting could have started Murray's CIO general counselor Lee Pressman. had been urging another name on Phil Murray, but I believe in time he swung behind Mr. Truman.\\" In Fall 1946, Lowenthal had lunch with Bob Patterson, newly promoted from Assistant Secretary of War to Secretary of War, whom he had known \\"for many years\\": Patterson told Lowenthal he was sending him to Berlin for a \\"war job, or a wartime-produced task... I think that was the last official position I held in government.\\" The job was restitution of property stolen by Nazis. Lowenthal reported to the U.S. High Commissioner of Germany, General Lucius D. Clay. Specifically, Lowenthal spent six weeks in Germany to collect evidence so he could draw up a report. Upon his return to the States, Lowenthal \\"had a good deal of work\\" on Nazi-related cases of \\"heirless\\" property. In that period, the U.S. Attorney General (Tom C. Clark at that time) made recommendations that included \\"relaxing the universal ban on wire tapping\\"‚Äìat which time, Lowenthal \\"noticed that that was in the list.\\" In 1948, Truman felt (according to Lowenthal in 1967) that the Mundt-Nixon Bill that year was \\"to punish sedition.\\" =FBI and HUAC investigations= Former U.S. Senator Burton K. Wheeler served as Lowenthal's counsel before HUAC in 1950 During 1947-1948, the FBI investigated Lowenthal. They used wiretaps, as evidenced in later- FOIA-ed FBI files. FBI files on Lowenthal also include draft versions of his 1948 book on the FBI. In 1950, Lowenthal published a book critical of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (see Works, below), which led to testimony denying he had \\"aided and abetted\\" Communist in government service before the House Un-American Activities Committee. The book and negative press helped end a 38-year career in public service. On August 28, 1950, Lee Pressman testified that he had not recommended Lowenthal for a job at the War Production Board. On September 1, 1950, Charles Kramer refused to answer questions as to whether he was acquainted with Lowenthal. That same day, U.S. Representative George A. Dondero called Lowenthal \\"menace to the best interests of America.\\" Dondero said that his government career was \\"replete with incidents where he aided and abetted Communists\\" starting in 1917. On September 15, 1950, Lowenthal appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee AKA \\"HUAC\\" (two of whose members were Mundt and Nixon‚Äìof the Mundt-Nixon Bill). Already in August 1950, HUAC had re-subpoenaed four witness who had been part of Whittaker Chambers's Ware Group: Lee Pressman, Nathan Witt, Charles Kramer and John Abt. The committee had asked both Pressman and Kramer whether they knew Lowenthal; both confirmed. Lowenthal brought former U.S. Senator Burton K. Wheeler as counsel. After reviewing his curriculum vitae, the committee tried to link him with known Communist Party members and organizations, some of which he confirmed, others not, all without admitting any wrongdoing. Names mentioned included: Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, David Wahl, Bartley Crum, Martin Popper, Allan Rosenberg, Lee Pressman, the Russian-American Industrial Corporation, the Twentieth Century Fund, and the International Juridical Association. On November 19, 1950, the government published Lowenthal's closed-session testimony from September 15, 1950. During testimony, Lowenthal had denied aiding or abetting Communists in government service. Specifically, he denied any involvement in the employment or sponsoring of George Shaw Wheeler, a former US government employee who had defected to Czechoslovakia in 1947 and publicly requested political asylum there in 1950. He noted that Wheeler had been transferred to his division on the Board of Economic Warfare from the War Production Board \\"toward the end of my service with the board\\" He also said that Wheeler had not worked with him in Germany.\\" He also claimed to have advised Lee Pressman in 1944 against naming Henry A. Wallace as Democratic candidate for vice president. On November 27, 1950, Senator Bourke B. Hickenlooper noted, \\"In the Washington Post of November 26, 1950, there are published two reviews of a recent book entitled The Federal Bureau of Investigation, by Max Lowenthal, New Deal mystery man of Washington.\\" The first (\\"A Lawyer's Indictment in Mood of Prosecutor\\") was by Rev. Edmund A. Walsh S.J., of Georgetown University, which Hickenlooper read into the record. The second by Joseph L. Rauh Jr., a former civil servant, whom Hickenlooper denounced for criticizing the FBI, for chairing the National Committee for Democratic Action, and for affiliations with Alger Hiss, Donald Hiss, Felix Frankfurter, William Remington, and James L. Fly of Americans for Democratic Action. Hickenlooper stated \\"I have the greatest admiration and respect for the integrity of the director, Mr. J. Edgar Hoover, and his staff personnel\\" at the FBI. =Unofficial policy group member= During the 1950s, Lowenthal supervised \\"an operation... conducted... to prepare answers to the charges that Senator McCarthy was making.\\" This followed McCarthy's to the State Department of \\"a list.\\" Lowenthal was later unable to recall clearly the names of anyone who helped him: Truman Library oral historian Jerry N. Hess suggested that they might have included Herbert N. Maletz, Lowell Mellett, and Franklin N. Parks. The White House was supportive: when Lowenthal came to Washington to work, sometimes he would get office space there. In May 1951, White House Appointments Secretary Matthew J. Connelly asked Lowenthal to help General Harry H. Vaughan in \\"setting up testimony\\", after Vaughan admitted repeated episodes of trading access to the White House for expensive gifts. Later, he also helped Connelly himself (who was convicted of bribery charges in 1956). (When asked whether Lowenthal served on that counter-McCarthy committee, Connelly, however, said, \\"Not that I recall. He had nothing to do with the White House.\\") In mid-summer 1951, Truman wrote Lowenthal to thank him for a letter and respond regarding Senator Joseph McCarthy's speech of Jun 14, 1951, attacking George Marshall. They discussed the need for the U.S. government to support international security. \\"I certainly did appreciate your good letter,\\" Truman ended. In 1952, when Truman announced he would not seek re-election, Vice President Alben Barkley could not secure the presidential nomination from the Democratic Party due to a lack of endorsement from labor leaders. Connelly later recalled: > Hess: Do you recall the difficulty that Mr. Barkley had at the 1952 > convention with the labor delegates? > Connelly: I remember it very well because I had Max Lowenthal‚ÄìI believe you > know Max Lowenthal‚ÄìI had him out there and Max was very close to the labor > boys. I had a room at the Mayflower Hotel with two TV sets watching the > convention, and I used to get calls from Max, from Chicago, and the day > Barkley arrived‚Äìunfortunately he had very bad eyes‚Äìand he walked through the > lobby of the hotel and he didn't recognize the labor boys who were there. So > they thought they were snubbed. So I then got Les Biffle on the phone and > Les had always been very close to Barkley and he was out there at the > convention, as a matter of fact, he was sergeant at arms of the convention, > and I told Les what happened. So then they made a strategic mistake, because > labor leaders are all prima donnas, and I suggested to Les that Barkley set > up a meeting with these fellows and talk to them individually. So instead of > that they set up a breakfast the next morning and invited all the labor > leaders. Well, they are very jealous of each other. So, all that achieved > was one more snubbing for the prima donnas, so they sat on their hands as > far as Barkley was concerned. Lowenthal introduced Truman to U.S. Supreme Justice Louis Brandeis. In 1953, Lowenthal was \\"member\\" of the Truman Administration, according to the papers of American evangelist Billy James Hargis (who also lists him among \\"Alleged Reds\\" 1950‚Äì1954). Lowenthal's best known accomplishment occurred during his term as the chief adviser on Palestine to Clark Clifford, an advisor to President Truman, from 1947-1952. President Truman credited Lowenthal as being the primary force behind the United States recognition of Israel. (Apparently in contrast, Matthew J. Connelly pointed to David Niles, an associate of Harry Hopkins from the WPA), as \\"very effective in the problems we had in connection with the recognition of Israel\\" because of his contacts in the Jewish community: \\"David Dubinsky, Abraham Feinberg. You name any leader in the Jewish faction, and he had intimate contacts with him.\\" Connelly denoted Lowenthal as one of contacts‚Äì\\"oh, very much so, very much so.\\" When Niles died in 1951, Connelly chose Feinberg to succeed him in that liasion role.)) Historian Michael J. Cohen argues that Clark Clifford relied on Lowenthal for advice on Israel, and Lowenthal in turn on Benjamin V. Cohen. In the late 1950s, Norman Thomas criticized Bertrand Russell for citing Lowenthal and Cedric Belfrage as authorities on wrongdoings by the FBI. Russell responded in \\"The State of Civil Liberties\\" in The New Leader, published on February 18, 1957. Russell retorted, \\"You seem to imply that criticisms of the FBI can be ignored if they come from Communists or Fellow-travellers. In particular, you point out that Mr. Lowenthal had a grievance against the FBI. It is, however, an almost invariable fact that protests against injustice originate with those who suffer from them.\\" In which case, Russell recommended that Thomas go buy and read Lowenthal's book. As late as 1967, Lowenthal denied ever even discussing Israel with President Truman and claimed to have only heard of the partition of Palestine through a secondhand source in the White House. Personal life and death New Milford (2007), where Lowenthal maintained a home for many years Lowenthal was married to Eleanor Mack, niece of Judge Julian Mack. They had three children: David (1923), John (1925) and Elizabeth (Betty). His sons were David Lowenthal and John Lowenthal. On September 15, 1950, Lowenthal told HUAC that he kept homes at 467 West Central Park in Manhattan and in New Milford, Connecticut. During World War II, he resided at 1 West Irving Street, Chevy Chase, Maryland. Regarding Truman overall, late in life Lowenthal told Truman Library oral historian Jerry N. Hess: > I was deeply sold on Mr. Truman's usefulness to America. I haven't been a > hero worshipper but I have had deep affection for some men in public affairs > whom I got to know, and that was certainly true in the case of Mr. Truman. During the same interview, however, Lowenthal remembered Truman only one staff by name (Victor Messall). Regarding Truman's views on red scares in the United States, Lowenthal commented: He died age 83 on May 18, 1971, at home (444 Central Park West) of heart ailment. Lowenthal was a trustee of the Twentieth Century Fund from 1924 to 1933. Recollections about him Recollections of Lowenthal from Truman Library oral histories are mixed. Some are favorable: * \\"Disciple of Louis Brandeis\\": Margaret Truman * \\"A famous investigator\\" in 1935: Roswell L. Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense (1961‚Äì64) Others are less favorable: * \\"(Truman said)... I have two Jewish assistants on my staff, Dave Niles and Max Lowenthal. Whenever I try to talk to them about Palestine they soon burst into tears because they are so emotionally involved in the subject\\" in 1948: : Oscar R. Ewing, organizer and member of unofficial political policy group during Truman administration (1947‚Äì52) * \\" I know they thought he was a Communist. And I never could figure that out. They came around to me about it. Max was a far-out liberal. He was a very good investigator on the railroads.\\": Raymond P. Brandt, St. Louis Post-Dispatch Washington Bureau Chief (1934‚Äì1961) Stephen J. Spingarn, Federal Trade Commission Commissioner (1950‚Äì1953), recalled, > Max Lowenthal was a good friend of the President's from the days in the > '30s... They became friends at that time, and he had total access to the > White House. During the McCarthy period he was there all the time, almost > daily; he used to hang out in Matt Connelly's rear office. I had had an > encounter early in my White House career with Max Lowenthal. Clark Clifford > told me that Max was worried about an Internal Security bill (of 1950). However, Spingarn also suspected that Lowenthal (and Connelly) \\"stuck the knife in me.\\" Phileo Nash told Spingarn it was Connelly, influenced by Lowenthal: > I mentioned that Max Lowenthal had once told Niles, and possibly others that > I was a Facist, that was in 1949, because I told Lowenthal I favored > wiretapping under proper controls... Nash said it was quite possible that > Max Lowenthal was very vindictive, and he mentioned that Max Lowenthal is > currently spending much time in Matt's office with L's son. Spingarn further recalled: After the FBI book came out, Westbrook Pegler, a right‚Äêwing columnist, called Lowenthal \\"the mysterious New York lawyer, who now appears to have picked Harry Truman for President.\\" In the early 1930s, claimed Whittaker Chambers in his 1952 memoir Witness, Lowenthal (Max \\"Loewenthal\\" in Witness) was a member of the International Juridical Association (IJA), along with Carol Weiss King, Abraham Isserman, and Lee Pressman. In the inaugural issue of the Monthly Bulletin of the International Juridical Association (May 1932), \\"Max Lowenthal, member of the New York bar\\" appears in an article called \\"Protest Meeting.\\" During his 1950 HUAC testimony, Lowenthal admitted that he had helped organize the \\"National Lawyers Guild\\" in the 1930s. He was also a member of the American Bar Association and the New York Bar Association. Works J. Edgar Hoover, FBI director (1924‚Äì1972) In 1950 he wrote a book about the FBI,The Federal Bureau of Investigation (William Sloane, pub. 1950)The Federal Bureau of Investigation (Turnstile Press Limited, pub. 1950) in which he dealt with issues he felt were still unresolved \\"although they were brought to light and discussed by statesmen in 1908 and 1909 when the police force now known as the FBI was created.\\" The New York Times announced the book a day in advance of its publication on November 21, 1947, with a subtitle that read \\"Lawyer Says Hoover Policies Set Up Secret Police.\\" In New York Times Sunday Book Review, Cabell Phillips said the book showed \\"immense research and careful documentation\\" and \\"almost for the first time... it pulled aside the self‚Äêrighteous cloak in which the FBI has wrapped itself.\\" Writing for the University of Chicago Law Review in 1952, however, T. Henry Walnut (member of the Pennsylvania Bar) noted \\"From Mr. Lowenthal's review of the FBI's political activities they would appear negligible between the years 1924 and 1946, when the Bureau picked up the trail of the Communist. This period, however, was not a political vacuum. It was filled with differences as bitter as any the country has ever known... If Mr. Lowenthal is still looking for evidence as to what can be done through the FBI, under its present centralized direction from Washington, to oppress dissenting individuals and groups, it would be well for him to study the period from December 8, 1941 to the end of 1945. George M. Elsey, Administrative Assistant to the President (1949‚Äì1951) felt that \\"Lowenthal had a passionate dislike of the FBI and J. Edgar Hoover in particular.\\" Asked to read galley proofs for his book on the FBI, he later commented, \\"The book was so unfair, so grossly biased, so sloppily done in every respect that it couldn't possibly influence anybody about the FBI. Any serious reader would just lay the thing aside in disgust... The President was just tolerant, shrugged his shoulder, tended to laugh it off and say, 'Oh, Max is that way'.\\" Books: * The Investor Pays (1933) (1936) * The Railroad Reorganization Act (1933) * Uncredited speeches for Harry S.

Robert Stewart was half-brother to Mary, Queen of Scots and uncle to James VI and I of Scotland and England. Biography In 1539 Robert was made Commendator of Holyrood Abbey, and Commendator of Charlieu Abbey in France by 1557.Joseph Robertson, Inventaires de la Royne d'Ecosse, Bannatyne Club (1863), xxxviii, note. On 9 February 1560 he testified against the Hamilton Duke of Ch√¢tellerault and Earl of Arran, and the Protestant Lords of the Congregation to James MacGill and John Bellenden of Auchnoule. They were collecting evidence for Henri Cleutin and Jacques de la Brosse, the French advisors of his step-mother Mary of Guise who planned to have the Hamiltons charged with treason against his half-sister, Mary, Queen of Scots and France. Robert himself had signed some of the letters that were to be cited as evidence.Dickinson, Gladys, ed., 'Report by De La Brosse and D'Oysel,' in Miscellany of the Scottish History Society, no.9, SHS (1958), pp.98, 118-120. Robert, his half-brother Lord John, the Marquis of Elbeuf and others performed at the sands of Leith in a tournament in December 1561. There was \\"running at the ring\\" on the sands of Leith, with two teams of six men, Robert's team dressed as women, the other as exotic foreigners in strange masquing garments. Robert's team were the winners.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 576. There was a similar tournament in 1594 at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle. He was knighted as Sir Robert Stewart of Strathdon on 15 May 1565, as part of marriage celebrations of Mary, Queen of Scots and Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 2, (1900), 161. In 1581 he was named, by James VI, the 1st Earl in a second creation of the Earldom of Orkney. The new earldom replaced a short-lived Dukedom of Orkney, which had been awarded in 1567 by Mary, Queen of Scots, to her notorious third husband James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell. This dukedom was forfeit later that same year after Mary was forced to abdicate and Bothwell was charged with treason. Prior to this dukedom there had existed an Earldom of Orkney that was surrendered in 1470 by William Sinclair, 3rd Earl of Orkney. Mary wrote a will at Sheffield in 1577 ineffectually declaring his title to Orkney null and void,A. Labanoff, Lettres de Marie-Stuart, vol. 1, 44; vol. 4, 361. after Robert was imprisoned in 1575 for obtaining a letter from the King of Denmark declaring him sovereign of Orkney. His crimes included colluding with Shetland pirates. The Earl was imprisoned at Linlithgow Palace.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (1907), 205-209, 277. He was released in 1579. He built the Palace of Birsay on Orkney. On his death in 1593 the earldom passed to his son Patrick Stewart, 2nd Earl of Orkney.

Three nondescript quotations in ancient authors were all that was known of the play until 1912,Hunt (1912) 31. when the extensive remains of a second-century CE papyrus roll of the Ichneutae were published among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri. With more than four hundred lines surviving in their entirety or in part, the Ichneutae is now the best preserved ancient satyr play after Euripides' Cyclops, the only fully extant example of the genre. The plot of the play was derived from the inset myth of the Homeric Hymn to Hermes. A newborn Hermes has stolen Apollo's cattle, and the older god sends a chorus of satyrs to retrieve the animals, promising them the dual rewards of freedom and gold should they be successful. The satyrs set out to find the cattle, tracking their footprints. Approaching the cave in which baby Hermes is hiding, they hear him playing the lyre, which he has just invented. Scared by the strange sound, the satyrs debate their next move. The nymph of the mountain in which Hermes is hiding, Cyllene, explains to them the nature of the musical instrument. Outside the cave the satyrs see some sewn cow-hides and are convinced that they have found the thief. Apollo returns as the papyrus breaks off.

The race is run as a benefit for youth activities in Marathon, Florida.http://7mbrun.com The event was first held in 1982 to commemorate the completion of the Florida Keys bridge rebuilding program. The bridge, one of the longest segmental bridges in the world, spans the channel between Knight's Key and Little Duck Key. It is one of the few races that takes place entirely over water, and actually covers a distance of - a little shorter than the name suggests. The local Sheriff's Department close the bridge between 6:45am and 9am, with the race kicking off at 7:30am. Runners therefore have up to 1 hour 30 minutes to traverse the bridge, and 'beat the bus' - if they can't keep up with the pace they are picked up by one of a small fleet of yellow school buses. A post-race party follows after the finishing runners are returned to the starting area by bus. Until 2012, entry to the race was via a postal lottery, with demand for places far outstripping the 1,500 spots available, restricted due to safety reasons. Applicants sent a self-addressed stamped envelope to the Marathon Runners Club before a specified deadline, at which date the Club sends all the applications to the prospective participants in the same delivery. The first 1,500 applications they then receive back are the 1,500 runners who gain entry. As a result, most participants were from the South of Florida and the Keys. Since 2012, registration has taken place online, typically with places filling up within an hour of opening. April 21, 2012 was the first and only year that the race was not run as planned. There were severe thunderstorms over Knight's Key during the early hours of the morning and just before the starting pistol was due to fire, the decision was taken to abandon the race rather than allow the runners on the bridge to be at risk of lightning strike.

Earlier implementations of the engine were known as W3D (Westwood 3D) while later versions were branded SAGE 2.0. History The first version of the engine, originally named W3D, was a major modification of the SurRender 3D engine developed by Hybrid Graphics Ltd.Majik 3D Project announces co-operation with Taika Technologies, Ltd. - SurRender 3D is one of the leading 3D libraries on the market and is currently being used in many commercial titles such as Westwood Studios' Command & Conquer: Renegade. Westwood first used W3D for their first-person shooter Command & Conquer: Renegade and their massively multiplayer online role-playing game Earth & Beyond. After Westwood was dissolved by their parent company, Electronic Arts, the engine was renamed SAGE (Strategy Action Game Engine) and updated for the release of Command & Conquer: Generals. The rendering portion remained nearly identical to the W3D engine, but most other elements had been redesigned from the ground up. The updated SAGE engine allowed for dynamic lighting that would cast realistic shadows and reflections on most objects, as well as higher quality visual effects and a stop-motion camera feature. The SAGE engine would continue to be used by EA Los Angeles on additional titles in the Command & Conquer series and on the real-time strategy series The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth. Following the release of the Command & Conquer 3 expansion Kane's Wrath, the engine underwent a large overhaul of its major systems. This new version of the engine was called SAGE 2.0 and was first used on Command & Conquer: Red Alert 3. Major upgrades included support for the PlayStation 3, an upgrade of the renderer to RNA (RenderWare New Architecture), complete replacement of the math library with RenderWare Math, integration of RenderWare Physics, dynamic environmental music, and numerous minor internal improvements.

History Prior to the establishment of Hill Air Force Base in 1940, the city of Roy had only one school that housed students of all ages. In 1943, that schoolhouse reached capacity and high school students were bused across Ogden to the north end of Washington Boulevard, a procedure practiced until 1965 when Roy High School was built. It became Weber County's largest high school at the time, and was later rated as one of the ten best in the nation. For the 2016‚Äì17 school year, Gina Butters, the former principal was promoted to the Board of Secondary Education, and Kirt Swalberg was named the new principal. In 2008, Roy High launched a new website for viewing full length boys' basketball games. In November 2018, the Utah High School Activities Association changed Roy High's sports classification to 6A, the highest in the state.

Life and career Hadida was born in Casablanca, Morocco. In 1978, he co-founded the company Metropolitan Filmexport with his brother Victor. The company later became a successful independent distributor of films in the French-speaking world. Metropolitan Filmexport is the current French distributor for films by Lionsgate and, formerly, New Line Cinema (Warner Bros. now releases New Line films). In 1990, Hadida formed a new company, Davis Films. Since 1993, the company has produced more than thirty Hollywood films, with True Romance being the first. Though Hadida contributed to the film industry over many decades, his work in spearheading the Resident Evil film franchise is what he is best known for. When Hadida learned the project was struggling, he reached out Constantin Film and offered a 50/50 venture deal. This project, as well as his work with the film adaptation of Silent Hill, has contributed to his recognition within the realm of video game adaptations. Hadida died at the UCLA Santa Monica Hospital after a short illness.https://deadline.com/2018/11/samuel-hadida-dies-industry- reactions-1202510165/ Controversy In 2011, Davis Films signed an agreement to create a film adaptation of the book series House of Night.

He was born in Slavyansk-na-Kubani, Krasnodar Krai, before moving to Tomsk with his family. After graduating from the Tomsk Medical Institute, he worked as a surgeon in Krasnoyarsk Krai before returning to Tomsk to work in the local psychiatric hospital. He later entered the Tomsk State Pedagogical University and earned his teaching certification. After two years of teaching, Makarov entered public service: first as the chairman of the presidium of Sovietskii Rayon (1990‚Äì1992) and later as the head of the Sovietskii raion administration (1992‚Äì1996). In 1994, he won a seat in the Tomsk Oblast duma. His seat in the duma became a springboard for his run for the mayorship of the city in 1996. Makarov defeated Gennadiy Konovalov that year and was re-elected in 2001 and 2006. From 1996‚Äì2001 he served simultaneously as mayor and as a duma deputy.  Arrest  On 6 December 2006, Makarov was taken into custody on charges of abusing his office. He was initially accused of extorting over three million rubles ($114,000) from residents by threatening to destroy their real estate and preventing them from rebuilding. After further investigations, the police reported that they discovered Makarov held over $1.5 million worth of cash in his apartments. A search of his home uncovered one million rubles ($38,000) with another 300,000 rubles ($11,400) on the mayor himself.Graft probe targeting Siberian mayor reveals large sums in cash  Russia  RIA Novosti.

The Intellivoice is a large, brown cartridge that plugs into the Intellivision's side-mounted cartridge slot; games specifically designed for the device can then be inserted into a slot provided on the right-hand side of the module. An international version of the Intellivoice was planned, but never released. The Intellivoice was discontinued in 1983 due to poor sales, with only five titles released with support for the device. Despite this, it has been called an important innovation in gaming, since the Intellivoice software used speech as an important gameplay element. Development In the late 1970s and early 1980s General Instrument, like nearly every microelectronics manufacturer, was rolling out their own series of microprocessors and support chips in hopes of gaining a share of the then-new and rapidly exploding market for increasingly sophisticated consumer and industrial electronics. One of the peripheral and support chips introduced for G.I.'s microprocessors was the SP0256 Narrator speech synthesizer chip. Since the Intellivision was already based on General Instrument's CP1610 microprocessor and support chips, and talking electronic products (such as Texas Instruments' Speak & Spell) had already captured the public's fascination, it didn't take long for someone at Mattel Electronics to get the idea that a speech-synthesis module might be an interesting add-on for the console. Engineer Ron Carlson was put in charge of designing a device capable of utilizing the chip. Programmer Ron Surratt was hired to write the software for the module, and Patrick Jost would analyze the voice data for the device.Intellivision Lives Intellivoice Page The Narrator had 2kB of Read-Only Memory (ROM), and this was utilized to store a database of generic words that could be combined to make phrases in Intellivision games. The words included numbers, \\"press,\\" \\"enter,\\" \\"and,\\" \\"or,\\" and \\"Mattel Electronics Presents\\" in a generic male voice. These phrases (as well as the speech for the first game, Space Spartans) were recorded and digitized by Carlson and Jost at General Instrument's facility in New York, and the resulting data was turned into a mask so that a customized version of the SP0256 could be manufactured with the generic phrases permanently stored inside the chip. Since the Orator chip could also accept speech data from external memory, any additional words or phrases needed for specific games could be stored inside the game cartridge itself. According to Ron Surratt, when he first received Carlson & Jost's data from G.I.'s New York facility and loaded it into the prototype unit, all the device would do was repeat \\"Auk yooo! Auk yooo!\\" over and over to the Mattel executives and marketing personnel who had come to see the demonstration. This led to several heated phone calls between Hawthorne and New York, and considerable finger-pointing between the hardware and software camps until the problem was found. Once the bugs were ironed out, Mattel Electronics committed itself to producing voice games and built a state-of-the-art voice lab at their Hawthorne, California facility to do the recording and digitization on site. = International Intellivoice = This unit would have contained additional internal ROMs with the built-in \\"generic\\" library of words translated into French, German, and Italian, and would have been sold along with appropriately translated versions of the Intellivoice titles into those markets. While at least two prototypes were known to have been built, and translated versions of Space Spartans were programmed, neither they nor the International Intellivoice were ever released. = Intellivoice II = A restyled version of the Intellivoice module, designed to match the \\"white brick\\" style of the redesigned Intellivision II Master Component, appeared in the 1983 Intellivision catalog. However, no such restyled module was ever actually produced, not even as a prototype; the module seen in the catalog is simply a carved and painted block of wood. Market failure After testing Intellivoice games at the summer 1982 Consumer Electronics Show, Danny Goodman of Creative Computing Video & Arcade Games stated that the peripheral was \\"exciting\\" because \\"the initial games designed for it have made the voice an integral part of game play\\", unlike the Magnavox Odyssey¬≤'s voice module. The device was brought to the public in 1982 with an initial lineup of 3 games: Space Spartans, Bomb Squad, and B-17 Bomber. Despite critical acclaim, the Intellivoice did not sell nearly as well as Mattel had hoped; while initial orders were as high as 300,000 units for the module and its associated games, most of them just sat on retailers' shelves. Even a promotional giveaway of a free Intellivoice by mail with the purchase of an Intellivision Master Component failed to kick-start sales of the Intellivoice game titles; the fourth Intellivoice game release, Tron: Solar Sailer, sold 90,000 units. There were several issues that contributed to the system's failure in the marketplace: * The digitized voice data required a great deal of ROM space; as much as, or even more than, the game itself. At the time, these larger ROMs were much more expensive to produce, and so the Intellivoice-supporting titles ended up retailing for much more than a standard Intellivision game; while standard non-voice titles typically debuted at $39.95, then quickly dropped to around $20 ‚Äì $25 as new titles were released, Intellivoice titles retailed for as much as $45 apiece and were much slower to drop in price. * The Intellivoice itself was a costly add-on, debuting at around $100, and rarely selling for less than $80 (at least not until the unit was discontinued and retailers began dumping the inventory at cost to get rid of it). Though the Intellivoice package was bundled with a game (B-17 Bomber), this was considered a high initial investment. * Due to the limits on the amount of ROM space that could be put inside a cartridge, words had to be digitized at the lowest possible sampling rate at which they could still be understood, and it wasn't unusual for the sampling rate to be changed three or four times within the same word (lower rates for vowels, higher for consonants) to save space. This tended to give the voice a distinctly mechanical, unnatural sound. * No third-party games supported the Intellivoice. This was partly due to the difficulty of producing voice data for the Orator chip (since the data consisted of strings of analog-filter coefficients to modify the behavior of the chip's synthetic vocal-tract model, rather than simple digitized samples, the process was somewhat complex and required considerable support from G.I.), and partly due to the lack of information on how the Intellivoice module worked since Mattel, like most other game-console manufacturers of the day, did not want third parties to be able to compete with them by producing games for their systems. In August 1983 all personnel related to Intellivoice game and hardware development were laid off, and development on all further Intellivoice games was halted except for two: Space Shuttle, and World Series Major League Baseball. Space Shuttle, a NASA space mission simulator, continued development for a time, but was eventually cancelled for being \\"too much simulation and not enough game\\". World Series Major League Baseball, however, was completed as part of the initial round of games produced for the Entertainment Computer System add-on module, making it the final game produced with Intellivoice support. Unlike the other four Intellivoice games, WSMLB didn't actually require the use of the Intellivoice in order to play; the game was merely \\"voice enhanced\\" for those Intellivision owners who happened to have both the ECS and Intellivoice modules.

Biography He was born Irving Goldberg in Brooklyn, New York, United States. A member of ASCAP (American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers) since he was a teenager, he enlisted in the US Navy the day after the Attack on Pearl Harbor. While in uniform, he and Vic Mizzy wrote entertainments for personnel stationed at the Staten Island Navy Yard, and he later served as a quartermaster on an LST involved in African and European invasions during World War II. He married Katharine Snell, an American dancer, model and actress, on 20 September 1942 and they had two children. He had changed his last name by 1936 from Goldberg to Taylor. He lived and worked in New York City until enlisting in the Navy. After the war ended, he began writing and producing for television (The Carmen Cavallero Show, The Freddy Martin Show, and several situation comedies), and maintained homes in both New York City and Los Angeles, California, until finally settling in Los Angeles around 1956. In the late 1950s, Taylor wrote words and music for a series of novelty albums which were released on the Warner Bros. label. The first was Terribly Sophisticated Songs, which parodied various genres of the popular music of the time, and featured \\"Pachalafaka,\\" which was covered by Soupy Sales and broke into the Top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 in 1958. The following year saw The Garbage Collector in Beverly Hills, which parodied work songs \\"for the odd job holder.\\" This was followed by Drink Along With Irving, which parodied songs about alcohol such as \\"You Go To My Head\\" and \\"The Whiffenpoof Song.\\" In 1960, Warner Bros. released The Whimsical World of Irving Taylor, a compilation of the most popular of the numbers from the preceding albums. Many of the arrangements for all of the Warner Bros. albums were written by Henry Mancini. Taylor formed a publishing company, Kiss Music Co. in the late 1950s. Also a member of ASCAP, \\"Kiss\\" was an anagram made from the first letters of Taylor's wife and children's first names. Kiss Music Co. now does business in [Philadelphia, PA], where Taylor's son Stephen resides. His daughter Suzanna died on January 5, 1995, in Wilmington, NC, where her children continue to reside. Taylor died on December 3, 1983, in [Westlake Village, California], Los Angeles County, California. He is buried at Mt. Sinai Memorial Park, in Los Angeles.

Her talent attracted the attention of masters such as Teodulo Romulo, Rufino Tamayo, Jean Dubuffet, and Gilberto Aceves Navarro who all took Veronica under their wings as a student and prot√©g√©. She was commissioned to paint a mural at the ABC Hospital that was unveiled by the U.S. Ambassador in Mexico, Charles J. Pilliod Jr. and attended by Prince Charles, Prince of Wales, and later a mural for the Hamon Science Building at the Southwest Medical Center in Dallas for Nancy Hamon. In addition, Veronica has held several solo exhibitions including the Museo de Arte Moderno in Mexico, Mexico Loteria, the , Nordstrom in the Galleria of Dallas and the Irving Art Center. Biography Veronica Ruiz de Velasco was born in M√©xico D.F. to Pedro Ruiz de Velasco (1915-1996) and Susana Zenteno Ruiz de Velasco and was the 15th child out of 18 siblings. In 1983, Ruiz de Velasco was accepted to take art courses at La Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes La Esmeralda in Mexico City. In 1984, the curator of the Gallery of Lourdes Chumacero in Mexico exhibited her work. This was a springboard into the Mexican Art community, as it was attended by many leading painters such as Teodulo Romulo, Thomas Parra, and Gilberto Aceves Navarro. Romulo offered Ruiz de Velasco lessons on his technique. In 1984, Ruiz de Velasco went to Paris, France, to discuss art technique with Jean Dubuffet. In 1985, Rufino Tamayo asked Ruiz de Velasco to come to his studio to take some private lessons with him. Tamayo commented that Ruiz de Velasco's art had \\"an excellent Color\\". 1985‚Äì88, Ruiz de Velasco took several courses at the Academia de San Carlos (Old San Carlos Academy) in Mexico City while taking private lessons from Gilberto Aceves Navarro. She considers him as her most important teacher. Exhibitions in Mexico In 1985, Ruiz de Velasco held an exhibition at the Gallery of the Loteria National of Mexico. In 1986 she held an individual exhibition in the terminal of the Benito Juarez International Airport in Mexico City. In 1987, she was the youngest female artist to exhibit at the Museo de Arte Moderno (national Museum of Modern Art) in Mexico. The exhibition was an homage to Andrew Lloyd Webber and had reference pieces such as Cats, Jesus Christ Superstar, Evita, Starlight Express, and the Phantom of the Opera. The Museo de Arte Moderno published their twenty five year celebration book and included Ruiz de Velasco as one of Mexico's leading artists. In 1989, Ruiz de Velasco painted a mural in the American British Cowdray Medical Center in Mexico D.F.. This mural took almost a year to complete. The inauguration of the mural was a national event in Mexico, unveiled by the U.S. Ambassador in Mexico, Charles J. Pilliod Jr. Charles, Prince of Wales was also present and congratulated Ruiz de Velasco on the donation of her time and effort. In 1991, Ruiz de Velasco created a painting for the Playboy Collection in Chicago, Illinois. She was then asked by the curator, Jack Bolton, of the Rockefeller Collection in New York City to create a piece for their collection. In 1994, Goodyear Corporation in Akron, Ohio held an exhibition of Ruiz de Velasco's artwork in their private executive gallery. In 1995, Coronado S.A. de C.V. held an exhibition of Ruiz de Velasco's artwork in their gallery in M√©xico, D.F. In 1996, Ruiz de Velasco created a portrait for President Bill Clinton. President Clinton and Hillary Clinton sent a letter of appreciation for this portrait. Career in the United States In the summer of 1995, Ruiz de Velasco was vacationing for two weeks with her father in Cozumel and met her future husband. In July, 1996, she married him at the Igelsias San Miguel on the Isla de Cozumel. In August her father died at the age of 81. In September she returned to Dallas with her husband. The January 1997 edition of the Lifestyle Magazine contained a biography of Ruiz de Velasco's Career. In February the Anasazi Gallery in Dallas held a solo exhibition for Ruiz de Velasco. In April, Lucent Technologies held an exhibition of her work in their private executive gallery in Mesquite, Texas. In June, AT&T; held an exhibition in their private executive gallery in Las Colinas, Texas. In October, Nordstrom of the Galler√≠a in Dallas promoted Ruiz de Velasco's oil paintings throughout their store in honor of Hispanic Heritage Month. Ruiz de Velasco signed several hundred autographs. Nordstrom of the Galler√≠a also held a fashion show with their top clothing lines with Ruiz de Velasco's art images used as a photographic backdrop. In 1997, Mrs. Nancy Hamon asked Ruiz de Velasco to create a mural for the Nancy and Jake L. Hamon Biomedical Research Building at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas. The mural was 3 meters by 4 meters. It was inaugurated by Nancy Hamon and the Director of the Medical Center, Dr. Kern Wildenthall. In April 1999, Ruiz de Velasco held an exhibition at the Florence Art Gallery in Dallas, Texas. In July 1999, the Beaux Art at the Dallas Museum of Art chose Ruiz de Velasco to provide several of her paintings to auction off for charity. In October, she held an individual exhibition at the Irving Arts Center (Museum) in Irving, Texas. In April 2000, Ruiz de Velasco held an exhibition at the Mission Gallery in Highland Park, Texas. In 2003, she created two murals and donated them to the Beaty Early Childhood School in Plano, Texas. In 2005 she painted an airplane hung from the ceiling of the new International Terminal at the Dallas-Fort Worth Airport. In 2007, she painted the front cover of the September/October 2007 edition of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists. In 2009, Veronica Ruiz de Velasco is one of five Mexican artists selected to create a painting representing Mexico at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. In 2019, Veronica Ruiz de Velasco is interviewed on the TV Show \\"Estamos Unidos America\\" which will air on Mega TV.

The Chief of the Name and Arms of Burnett is James Comyn Amherst Burnett of Leys, Baron of Kilduthie. They are from Deeside, near Banchory, in Northeast Scotland. From the early 14th century to the mid 16th century the family occupied a lake dwelling on the Loch of Leys, and resided there or on land near the lake for over 200 years. It is from this lake that the family eventually acquired the designation \\"of Leys\\". Origins of the name It remains uncertain if the name of Burnett is of Saxon or Norman origins. It has been suggested that the name Burnett is derived from the Old French burnete, brunette, which is a diminutive of brun meaning \\"brown\\", \\"dark brown\\". Another proposed origin of the name is from burnete, a high quality wool cloth originally dyed to a dark brown colour.Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 2-3 There is also evidence which suggests that Burnett stems from the English surname of Burnard, a derivative of the Anglo-Saxon name \\"Beornheard\\". Spelling variations of the name in early documents show Burnet and Burnard/Bernard being used interchangeably for the same family and at times for the same person. It is likely that the family of de Bernard first came to Scotland with the return of David I of Scotland and that they settled in Roxburghshire. Early Burnetts in Scotland There is documented evidence of the family of Burnard in England from the Norman Conquest in 1066, but not before. These are found in the Domesday Book, the Chartulary of St Neots Priory and in charters concerning the Waltham Abbey.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 3 Roger Burnard was the Domesday tenant of Alrichesey and also held a manor in Rodedie hundred, Hampshire and the manors of Celdretone and Coteford in Wiltshire; all of which were held of William De Ow.Frederic Madden; Bulkeley Bandinel; John Gough Nichols, Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica, Vol. VI (London: J. B. Nichols and Son, 1840), p. 198 He, his wife Margaret and his son Odo were named in several charters of St. Neot's and in one there is a mention of a daughter, Magilia Burnard.Frederic Madden; Bulkeley Bandinel; John Gough Nichols, Collectanea Topographica Et Genealogica, Vol. VI (London: J. B. Nichols and Son, 1840), p. 199 Among the English who came north in the train of David I of Scotland were Burnards who settled in the County of Roxburgh and owned the considerable barony of Farningdoun (aka. Fairnington).Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 6-7 They were benefactors of Melrose Abbey and other religious houses. They soon move on to the Northeast of Scotland, where Alexander Burnard settled near Banchory. This Alexander Burnard is considered \\"The first of the Deeside Burnards, or Burnetts as they were later called\\".George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 6 =Burnets of Farningdoun= Roger Burnard of Faringdoun gave two grants of land of that barony; one being witnessed by his sons Geoffrey, Walter, Ralph and Richard.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in Southern Scotland', Eileen A. Bailey, 'Saxon or Norman?',Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 7 Ralph, his son and heir appears in the Episcopal Records of Glasgow in 1208 as providing fuel in the form of peat to the Bishop of Glasgow. In 1252 Richard Burnard of Farningdoun sold the Eastmeadow of Faringdoun to the Abbey of Melrose, confirmed in a charter of Alexander III of Scotland that same year. After 1381 the link between the Burnards and Fairingdoun seems to have been lost.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in Southern Scotland', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 8 =Burnets of Burnetland and Barns= The Burnards or Burnets owned lands in Peeblesshire named for them, Burnetland. A Robert de Burnetland () was a witness to the foundation charter of Selkirk Abbey by David I prior to his becoming king, and to several charters afterwards.Montgomery Burnett, Genealogical account of the family of Burnet, of Burnetland and Barns (Edinburgh: 1853), p. 13 An indicator of when this family became of Barns is from the will of William Burnet of Barns, Treasurer- Clerk of Scotland, dated 30 April 1656 stating that his predecessors had held Barns for three hundred years. This would date the family's connections to Barns to at least 1356. The genealogy of the Burnet family of Burnetland and Barns traces down to when the estate was sold in 1838.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in Southern Scotland', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 8‚Äì22 At times the family of Burnet of Barns and that of Leys have contended for the chiefship of the House of Burnet. =Burnard of Ardross and Currie= Thought to be originally of the Burnards of Farningdoun, John Burnard owned part of the lands of Ardross in Fife and of a part of those in Currie in Midlothian. He accompanied king David II of Scotland on his journey south in 1346 and in the attack on the fort of Liddell where John Burnard was severely wounded and left at Roxburgh Castle where he later died of his wounds.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in Southern Scotland', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 23 But before he died Roxburgh surrendered to the English and it was assumed John Burnard was a traitor who joined the English. As a result, his lands were forfeited and given to Alexander Maitland. When David II was released from captivity the truth was known and the lands were restored by royal charter to John Burnard's nearest kinsman, William of Dishington. The Dishington's continued ownership until about 1700 when the lands were sold.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in Southern Scotland', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 23-4 Burnetts in north-east Scotland Burnetts who settled in the north-east of Scotland are primarily located in Kincardineshire and Aberdeenshire. These branches stemmed from the family of Leys, the ancestors of the present Chief of the Name of Burnett, James C. A. Burnett of Leys.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets in North- East Scotland', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 26 =Burnett of Leys= Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys, 3rd Bt and 15th Laird painted by John Scougal. the coat of arms of James Comyn Amherst Burnett of Leys, Chief of the Name and Arms of Burnett, Baron of Kilduthie. Alexander Burnard, almost certainly of Farningdoun, is considered \\"The first of the Deeside Burnards, or Burnetts as they were later called\\".George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 6 Alexander was an adherent of Robert the Bruce and for his services to the king he was rewarded in 1323 with land in Banchory and a position as the Royal Forester of Drum. He also received a charter of that king of the lands of Kilhenach, Clerech, and other lands in Aberdeenshire dated 28 March 1324.Robert Douglas, The Baronage of Scotland, vol. I (Edinburgh: 1798), p. 41 This was about the time the Burnard or Burnett family first took up residence on an artificial island called a crannog, on the Loch of Leys.National Trust for Scotland. 1969. Crathes Castle, Fifth ed. Edinburgh. 4. The history of the family from this time onward is recorded in detail. During the next three centuries the Burnetts came to gain prominence in the area by making connections with the church, granting lands and other endowments. John Burnet \\"of Leyis\\", the fifth laird, was the first in this family to bear the distinction \\"of Leys\\" which from this time onward was applied both to the lands and to the family who held them.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), pp. 10-11 His son, Alexander Burnet of Leys was the first 'Baron of Leys' during the reigns of James II of Scotland, James III and James IV.Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 36 In 1553, Alexander Burnet of Leys, the ninth lord of Leys began construction on Crathes Castle, which was finished by his great- grandson, another Alexander, the twelfth lord, in 1596.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 22 Alexander Burnett, 12th Laird of Leys (d. 1619), Laird of Crathes Castle, acquired Muchalls Castle about 1600 and commenced its early 17th-century reconstruction. Having died in 1619, the completion of Muchalls Castle was carried out by Alexander Burnett's son, Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet. Ownership of Muchalls Castle passed from the Burnett of Leys family about 1882. Crathes remained in the ownership of the Burnett family descendants for over 350 years, until 1952 when Sir James Burnett, 13th Baronet gave it to the National Trust for Scotland as part of Scotland's heritage.The National Trust for Scotland. 1988. Crathes Castle and Garden. Edinburg: Marketing Services Division of the National Trust for Scotland. 6-9. Heraldic history There were no known seals for Burnett of Leys before 1621.Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 177 In 1550 Burnet of Burnetland (later Barns) appealed to the then Lord Lyon King of Arms to change his motto to that already in use by Burnett of Leys, Virescit vulnere virtus (strength draws vigour from an injury).Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 178 Apparently successful, the Burnett of Leys lord then began using the motto Alterius non sit qui potest esse suus (he would not be another's who could be his). The earliest arms for Burnett of Leys was found on a carved panel dated to some thirteen years later showing the impaled arms of Burnett and Hamilton commemorating the marriage between Alexander Burnett (1529‚Äì1574) and Janet Hamilton. The arms of Burnett of Leys in 1553 used a shield, charged with three holly leaves and a hunting horn, blazoned: Argent, three holly leaves in chief vert and a hunting horn in base sable stringed Gules. The crest, a hand holding a knife shown pruning a vine had the motto: Alterius non sit qui potest esse suus (same meaning as above) or a variant: Alterius non sit qui suis esse potest (who can be his would not be another's).Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 179 The next progression was that of Thomas Burnett of Leys, knighted in 1620, whose seal of Bore a shield with holly leaves and hunting horn, set within foliage decoration with his name and rank but no crest or motto. By 1627 and upon completion of Muchalls Castle, the impaled arms of Sir Thomas Burnet and his second wife Janet Moncreiffe now had supporters. On the dexter side was a huntsman in contemporary dress with a hunting horn suspended from his shoulder while the sinister supporter was a greyhound with a collar.Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 180 In addition to the current motto, displayed beneath the supporters, was the motto above the hand, knife and crest, apparently ignoring the ruling of 1550 by the Lord Lyon Sir David Lindsay, the previous Burnett motto: Virescit vulnere virtus. In 1672 the Scottish Parliament decided to record every coat of arms in Scotland, a project that took over twenty years to complete just the first volume.Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 181 Appearing in folio 122 in the first volume were the arms of Sir Thomas Burnett, 3rd Baronet (1663‚Äì1714). This version had no supporters and only one motto: virescit vulnere virtus.. In 1822 King George IV visited Scotland and encouraged by Sir Walter Scott highland chiefs were to appear before the king in their appropriate tartan. Many of these chiefs had no idea what their tartan was and a Mr. Wilson, a weaver of Bannockburn near Stirling was quick to come up with numerous designs which was the start of the commercial tartan industry in Scotland. In a petition to the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas, the head of an established lowland house decided the Burnetts should be considered highlanders, possibly to impress the king, and petitioned the Lord Lyon to change the huntsman supporter to a highlander with kilt. This achievement was recorded in Folio 33, in the fourth volume of the Public Register of All Arms and Bearings in Scotland (24 October 1838). The next significant change came one hundred and twenty-nine years later when the current head of the House of Burnett, James Comyn Amherst Burnett of Leys, Baron of Kilduthie, petitioned the Lord Lyon to confirm him as heir of the undifferenced arms of Burnett of Leys.Charles J. Burnett, Ross Herald, 'The Heraldry of the Burnett Family', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 182 The third matriculation of the Burnett arms were granted to him on 22 May 1967 with changes: a silver shield with three holly leaves, black hunting horn decorated in gold with a red strap, and the crest is a hand with a knife pruning a vine. The crest sits on a red baronial chapeau, symbolising the baronies of Leys and Kilduthie. Above the crest is the established motto: Verescit vulnere virtus and the kilt of the highlander supporter is the official Burnet of Leys tartan. The two supporters stand on a compartment (in the form of a grassy mound) with a ribbon bearing the motto: Alterius non sit qui suus esse potest not used since 1550. Following a meeting of Burnett kin in 1993 the title was formally changed to the House of Burnett. A fourth petition was made to the Lord Lyon for a Standard and a Pinsel recognising the head of the house of Burnet which was duly granted. The current Chief of the Name and Arms of Burnett, James C. A. Burnett, Baron of Kilduthie, arranged with the National Trust for Scotland for a room on the top floor of Crathes Castle to display items of interest for members of the Burnett family worldwide including armorial bearings. =Ramsays of Balmain= Through a marriage between Sir Thomas Burnett, 6th Baronet of Leys and the sister of Sir Alexander Ramsay, 6th Baronet of Balmain, the Burnetts became heirs of the line of Ramsay of Balmain.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 101 When Sir Alexander died in 1806 s.p. his estates passed to the immediate younger brother of his heir of that line, Alexander, second son of Sir Thomas Burnett of Leys. Alexander resigned the Sheriffdom of Kincardineshire on his succession to Balmain and after some time traveling he returned and built an elegant mansion called Fasque House. By Royal licence he assumed the name and arms of Ramsay and on 13 May 1806 he was created a Baronet of the United Kingdom as Sir Alexander Ramsay of Balmain. He died at Fasque on 17 May 1810 and his descendants retained the name of Ramsay dropping the surname of Burnett altogether. =Burnetts of Craigmyle= James Burnett, son of Alexander Burnett of Leys and next younger brother of Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet of Leys. Upon his marriage in 1608 to Elizabeth Burnet, daughter of Thomas Burnett of Craigmyle and Tillihaikie, the grandson of William Burnett of Craigour, Campbell and Tillihaikie who fell at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547. He and his wife had sasine of the lands of Craigmyle, Pitmedden and the Mill of Craigmyle.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 112 By this marriage he became almost as considerable a laird as his brother Sir Thomas.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets of Craigmyle & Crimond', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 89 He was known as a peacemaker and negotiator in his time. The cadet line of Craigmyle died out in the male line after 1750.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets of Craigmyle & Crimond', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 91-2 =Burnetts of Crimond= This branch descends from Robert Burnet, Lord Crimond, another brother of Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet. He was the third son of Alexander Burnet, above-mentioned, and Katherine Gordon.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnets of Craigmyle & Crimond', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 92 Robert studied law in France for several years and in 1617 was admitted to the Scottish Bar. He was a Scottish advocate and Judge of the Court of Session in 1661 as Lord Crimond. His heir was his third son Alexander Burnett. His fifth son was Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Salisbury. =Burnetts of Kemnay= James Burnett, the next younger brother of Sir Thomas Burnett, 1st Baronet, married Elizabeth Burnett as mentioned above. Their second son, Thomas Burnett of Kemnay was the first laird of Kemnay.Bernard Burke, A Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Great Britain & Ireland, Vol. I (London: Harrison & Sons, 1894), p. 256 Thomas was a writer in Edinburgh and married Margaret Pearson, daughter of John Pearson, a merchant in Edinburgh.George Burnett, The Family of Burnett of Leys; With Collateral Branches, ed. James Allerdyce (Aberdeen: The New Spalding Club, 1901), p. 118 He purchased Kemnay from Sir George Nicolson, Lord Kemnay, a Lord of Session. The older residence that the newer mansion replaced, was built by Sir Thomas Crombie, had been owned previously by the Auchinlecks and the Douglases of Glenbervie.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnetts of Kemnay', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 97 The current laird of Kemnay is Susan Letitia Burnett, 9th of Kemnay. =Burnetts of Monboddo= Monboddo House This branch stems from James Burnet of Lagavin, the third son of James Burnett of Craigmyle and his wife Elizabeth Burnett.The Family of Burnett of Leys, Aberdeen University Studies, No. 4 (Aberdeen: University of Aberdeen, 1901), pp. 143-44 In 1642 James married Isobel Forbes who died a short time later after which James married secondly Elizabeth Irvine, daughter of Robert Irvine of Monboddo and Elizabeth Douglas of Glenbervie. About 1671 James purchased Monboddo from his brothers-in-law. In addition to Monboddo, which became the seat of this branch, James acquired Kair, Whitefield, Sillyflat, Hallgreen, Johnshaven and Ballandro in Kincardineshire and Aberdeenshire. His grandson, James Burnett, the third laird of Monboddo supported the Stuart cause and was captured at the Battle of Falkirk Muir. He was held prisoner for some time but was liberated through the influence of powerful friends. But subsequent events caused him to have to sell all but Monboddo and Lagavin, which he sold to his eldest son, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo, the fourth laird who rose to become an eminent scholar and judge.The Family of Burnett of Leys, Aberdeen University Studies, No. 4 (Aberdeen: University of Aberdeen, 1901), pp. 144‚Äì45 =Burnetts of Camphill= This branch is apparently descended from William Burnett of Craigour, Wester Camphill and Tillihaikie who fell at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnetts of Camphill, Elrick and Kirkhill', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 128-30 His son Andrew Burnett succeeded him to the lands of Camphill. In 1605 these lands were part of the Leys estate and at that time William Burnett, the son of Andrew Burnett held Camphill as a tenant. A Thomas Burnett of Camphill, mentioned in the Aberdeenshire Poll Book of 1696, was at the time living in Aberdeen. =Burnetts of Elrick= The eldest son of the abovementioned Andrew Burnett of Camphill, John Burnett (1625‚Äì1666) was the 1st of ElrickAlexander Johnston, Short memoir of James Young, merchant burgess of Aberdeen, and Rachel Cruickshank, his spouse, and of their descendants (Aberdeen : J. Craighead, 1861), p. lxi John Burnett acquired these lands by assignation from William Innes of Kinnermonie who had a charter for Elrick in 1663.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnetts of Camphill, Elrick and Kirkhill', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 130-32 The barony of Elrick included the lands of that estate, along with the mill and croft, Smiddieland and Broomiebrae of Elrick, the lands and town of Monacabback, Ord and Scrogley of Monacabback and the lands of Snellen. The lands were still in this family after the death of Peter Burnet of Elrick in 1870.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnetts of Camphill, Elrick and Kirkhill', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), p. 137 =Burnetts of Kirkhill= The first of Kirkhill, in the parish of Dyce near Aberdeen, was Alexander Burnett (1620‚Äì1685), the son of Thomas Burnett, merchant, and his wife Margaret Johnston.Eileen A. Bailey, 'The Burnetts of Camphill, Elrick and Kirkhill', Crannog to Castle; A History of the Burnett Family in Scotland, ed. Eileen A. Bailey (Banchory: Leys Publishing, 2000), pp. 138-39 As a Baillie of Aberdeen Alexander Burnett was designated Polls or Poles indicating a merchant with strong trading ties to Poland, a designation his son, the 2nd laird Thomas took as a nickname. The great granddaughter of the first laird, Margaret Burnett (born 1719) eventually succeeded to Kirkhill and by her marriage to Alexander Bannerman of Frendraught, also a merchant in Aberdeen, the lands of Kirkhill passed to the Bannerman family.Eileen A.

With a mind towards designing rather than editing fashion, she left ELLE after less than two years, preferring apprenticeships even when they paid little and offered no time off. She became a designer, buyer, and press attach√© for Doroth√©e Bis in Paris. She freelance designed for Limitex, Pierre d'Alby, V de V, and Eversbin in the years 1965 and '66. In the latter year, she founded CMC (Comptoir Mondial de Creation), parent of the agn√®s b. label. She opened her first boutique in Les Halles in 1975. Formerly a butcher shop, the black and white tiled store had a rustic, communal atmosphere, defined by an indoor swing for children and an impromptu aviary (in reality an on-site bird population that over time grew from two to 30). Birds flew free in the cavernous space, built nests and hatched their chicks in the displays. \\"It was very cool\\" she says \\"We were writing on the walls.\\" agn√®s's friends were her first repeat customers.

She opened her first international store on Prince Street in New York's SoHo district in 1983. Her enthusiasm for the city stemmed from her love of the American crime film genre, dubbed film noir in France. This interest extended to the store's decor, which included vintage, oversized movie posters. The one-sheets would eventually draw the attention of filmmaker Harmony Korine, who would begin an artistic collaboration with agn√®s in 1999. agn√®s b. launched \\"Le b.\\" perfume in 1987, a skincare and cosmetics line.

He is known for his work on French identity and memory. His name is associated with the study of new history. He is the brother of the late Simon Nora, former French officer. Nora occupies a particular position that he himself qualifies as on \\"the side\\" of the French historical sphere.  Education  In the 1950s he took hypokh√¢gne and kh√¢gne at the Lyc√©e Louis-le-Grand but, contrary to a persistent legend, he was not accepted at the √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure. Thereafter, he obtained a licence de lettres (equivalent to the Bachelor of Arts) degree in philosophy. He passed the agr√©gation d'histoire in 1958. Career He was a teacher at the Lyc√©e Lamorici√®re d'Oran in Algeria until 1960. He wrote a book about his experiences, published under the title Les Fran√ßais d'Alg√©rie (The French of Algeria) (1961). From 1961 to 1963, he was a resident at the Thiers Foundation. From 1965 to 1977 he was first assistant and then lecturer at the Institut d'√âtudes Politiques de Paris (Paris Institute of Political Science). Since 1977 he has been the director of studies at the √âcole des hautes √©tudes en sciences sociales (School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences). In 2014 Nora received the Dan David Prize Award. = Publishing = Concurrently, Nora had managed an important career in publishing. He joined √âditions Julliard in 1964, where he created the Archives paperback collection. In 1965 he joined √âditions Gallimard: the publishing house, which already had a good marketshare in literature, wanted to develop its social sciences sector. It was Pierre Nora who achieved this mission by creating two important collections, the Library of social sciences in 1966 and the Library of histories in 1970, as well as the T√©moins collection in 1967. At √âditions Gallimard, Nora published in these collections that he was directing, important works which generally constitute indispensable references in their fields of research, in particular: * In the Library of social sciences, Raymond Aron (Les √âtapes de la pens√©e sociologique, 1967), Georges Dum√©zil (Mythe et √©pop√©e, 1968‚Äì1973), Marcel Gauchet (Le D√©senchantement du monde, 1985), Claude Lefort (Les Formes de l'histoire, 1978), Henri Mendras (La Seconde R√©volution fran√ßaise, 1988), Michel Foucault (Les Mots et les Choses, 1966, and L'Arch√©ologie du savoir, 1969). * In the Library of histories, Fran√ßois Furet (Penser la R√©volution fran√ßaise, 1978), Emmanuel Le Roy Ladurie (Montaillou, 1975, best sale of the collection with 145 000 copies), Michel de Certeau (L'√âcriture de l'histoire, 1975), Georges Duby (Le Temps des cath√©drales, 1976), Jacques Le Goff (Saint Louis, 1997), Jean-Pierre Vernant (L'Individu, la mort, l'amour, 1989), Maurice Agulhon (Histoire vagabonde, 1988‚Äì1996), Michel Foucault (Histoire de la folie √† l'√¢ge classique, 1972, Surveiller et punir, 1975, and Histoire de la sexualit√©, 1976‚Äì1984). * Foreign researchers whom he introduced in France, like Ernst Kantorowicz (Les Deux Corps du roi, 1959, published in 1989), Thomas Nipperdey (R√©flexions sur l'histoire allemande, 1983‚Äì1992, in 1992), Karl Polanyi (La Grande Transformation, 1944, in 1983). This important role gave to Nora a certain power in French publishing and he was also the object of criticism. To begin, he refused in 1997 to translate Eric Hobsbawm's work, The Age of Extremes (1994), because of that author's \\"attachment to the revolutionary cause.\\" Nora explained that context of hostility towards Communism in France was not appropriate to that type of publication, that all the editors, \\"like it or not, had an obligation to take account of the intellectual and ideological situation in which they had written their works\\".Pierre Nora, \\"Traduire : n√©cessit√© et difficult√©s\\", Le D√©bat , 142(93), January/February 1997 (on line archive), pp.93‚Äì95  Intellectual life  In May 1980, Nora founded at Gallimard the review Le D√©bat with philosopher Marcel Gauchet; this quickly became one of the major French intellectual reviews. He had participated at the Saint-Simon Foundation, created in 1982 by Fran√ßois Furet and Pierre Rosanvallon and dissolved in 1999. He opposed himself to the law of 23 February 2005 \\"supporting national recognition and national taxation in favour of French repatriations\\" and cosigned a petition in the daily Lib√©ration entitled \\"Libert√© pour l'histoire\\".He presides over the eponymous Association This law, at line 2 of article 4, was abrogated on 15 February 2006, establishing that research programmes must be accorded more importance in lieu of French overseas presence and that the programmes of study came to recognize the positive role. Nora is equally well known for having directed Les Lieux de M√©moire, three volumes which gave as their point the work of enumerating the places and the objects in which are the incarnate national memory of the French. Nora's book Les Fran√ßais d'Alg√©rie (The French of Algeria) (1961) has received scholarly criticism for its bias against French Algerians (\\"Pied Noirs\\") ‚Äì a prejudice held by many French intellectuals of the time. Nora posited that the French Algerians (or settlers) were different from the French of the Metropol. His opinions were developed from his two years as a high school teacher in Algiers. \\"The French of Algeria\\" is described as synthesizing \\"a self-righteous anti-pied noir discourse\\". [Todd Shepard, \\"The Invention of Decolonization\\", Cornell University Press, 2006, pp. 195 ‚Äì 204.] \\"The French of Algiers\\" is often held out as a scholarly work, but as David Prochaska, American historian of French Algeria points out, it is in fact \\"not based on original research and is devoid of the usual scholarly apparatus\\". [David Prochaska, \\"Making Algeria French: Colonialism in B√¥ne , 1870 ‚Äì 1920\\", Cambridge, 1990, 6, quotes from Pierre Nora, \\"Les Fran√ßais d‚ÄôAlg√©rie\\", preface by Charles-Andre Julien (Paris, 1961), 87, 98.]  Private life  Nora is Jewish.Pascal Faustini, \\"La communaut√© juive de Hellimer\\" 2004, pp.268-270 He was married to art historian and curator Francoise Cachin.

It is common in shallow waters of the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea, where it is an important commercial and game fish. Description Atlantic bonito belong to a group which have the dorsal fins very near, or separated by a narrow interspace. Its body is completely scaled, with those scales in the pectoral fin area and the lateral line usually larger in size. Bonitos (fishes in the genus Sarda) differ from tuna by their compressed bodies, their lack of teeth on the roof of the mouth, and certain differences in colouration. Atlantic bonito share Atlantic waters with the striped bonito, Sarda orientalis (the Atlantic population of which is sometimes considered a separate species, Sarda velox). The striped bonito has been taken on the Atlantic coast as far north as Cape Cod. It is similar in its habits, but somewhat smaller than the more common Atlantic bonito. The Atlantic bonito can be distinguished from its relative by its dark oblique stripes on the back and with a maxillary only about half as long as the head, whereas the striped bonito has striping on its topside nearly horizontal and a maxillary more than half the length of the head. Atlantic bonito grow up to and weigh at this size. The world record, , was caught in the Azores. Habits It is a strong swimmer. Normally, it travels in fairly large schools and is common offshore in the vicinity of New York City, where it is known as \\"skipjack\\" because of its habit of jumping from the water. (However, the name \\"skipjack\\" more commonly refers to the skipjack tuna, Katsuwonus pelamis.) The spawning season is June, and specimens long are taken in September off Long Island. Diet Atlantic bonito eat mackerel, menhaden, alewives, silversides, sand lances, and other fishes, as well as squid. Fishing technique Bonito are often captured by tuna fishermen when trolling for bigger game. Bonito have also been caught using pound nets, and amongst other species as bycatch during the traditional fishing practice of Almadraba in addition to the main catch, the far larger Atlantic bluefin tuna. Thought by most fishermen to be inferior to tuna as a food fish, possibly because of the greater oiliness, it is sometimes used as bait. As food Bonito is a popular food fish in the Mediterranean; its flesh is similar to tuna and mackerel, and its size is intermediate between the two.Alan Davidson, Mediterranean Seafood, Penguin, 1972. , p. 123 Bonito under or so (called palamut ~ –ø–∞–ª–∞–º—É–¥ in Bulgarian) are often grilled as steaks. Larger bonito (torik in Turkish) are cut into steaks and preserved as lakerda. Bonito is also canned, but canned bonito del norte (Spanish) is not bonito, but albacore tuna. In Algeria and Spain, it is often prepared as escabeche, which preserves it for about a week. Bonito may also be baked and served cold.\\"Palamut papaz yahnisi\\", Davidson, p. 359  References  * E.

The film premiered in New York in August 2005, and it opened in other countries, including Venezuela, later that year. Plot The film follows the kidnapping of Carla (Maestro) and her boyfriend when they are suddenly kidnapped in Caracas, Venezuela. Carla (M√≠a Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul Leroux) are a young upper-class couple fresh from a night of dancing and partying when they cross paths with Trece (Carlos Julio Molina), Budu (Pedro Perez) and Niga (Carlos Madera), three men who make their living by kidnapping unwitting young adults to extort quick money from their wealthy parents. Carla and Martin become their next victims and are sent on a terrifying overnight journey through Caracas as they wait for Carla's father Sergio (Rub√©n Blades) to hand over twenty thousand dollars - a small amount for a rich Caraque√±o, but the equivalent of more than 8 years of the Venezuelan minimum wage. They are emotionally and physically hurt, but soon form a relationship with their captors to try to escape. However, none of their plans pan out. They continue in the Land Cruiser, listening and understanding, even if slightly, their captor's point of view. Through the many mishaps they encounter, they begin to, albeit scarily, bond with the kidnappers. Martin flees the kidnappers in a crowded square, telling Niga to kill his girlfriend, abandoning her. However, he is soon apprehended by one of their cronies and returned to them and murdered in the trunk of a taxi. After her father pays their ransom, the kidnappers heatedly argue over her fate, between murder, rape, and release. Trece pays his share to the others to release her unharmed, and Carla is soon released, only to be found by another set of kidnappers. However, Trece returns to the scene and shoots them, freeing her again at that time. In the final scene she can be seen with much more modest attire and an inelegant car, continuing her work with sickly, impoverished children.  Production  Jakubowicz wrote the screenplay based on his own experience of being kidnapped. Reception Secuestro Express was nominated for Best Foreign Language Film at the 2005 British Independent Film Awards. It was passed uncut (certificate 18) for DVD release in the UK by the British Board of Film Classification. It was released in the UK around the time of a visit by Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez, but did not coincide. The social narrative is highly discussed, with critics generally in agreement that social issues are made apparent but not commented on, with no \\"well-examined social theory\\". According to critic Ed Gonzalez, the film overall gives a \\"juvenile inspection of [the] country's moral oblivion\\", and shows a \\"pat reduction of [its] machismo\\". Another, Elizabeth Weitzman, offers that \\"the sadism is so gleefully nasty that it overshadows any rational argument\\", with Luke Y. Thompson adding that \\"the apparent thesis that poverty justifies such acts doesn't quite wash\\"; the New York Times reviewer opines that \\"the villains become more human, even sympathetic\\", in this film with \\"constant threat of violence and rape\\" that she does say is \\"difficult to endure\\". Peter Bradshaw for The Guardian wrote that there is \\"the lingering suspicion that Jakubowicz can neither be fully and sexily callous in the Tarantino style, nor sober enough to attempt a thorough critique of Venezuelan poverty\\". However, it still \\"enraged\\" Hugo Ch√°vez enough to publicly threaten Jakubowicz, a filmmaker who became more prominent and celebrated in the years after this. There were several controversies, primarily when the film was not selected to represent Venezuela in the Best Foreign Language category at the Academy Awards, with 1888: El Extraordinario Viaje de Santa Isabel chosen despite being less popular and acclaimed. Also, two lawsuits were filed against the film in the Venezuelan Supreme Court; one to remove the film from circulation because it contained alleged defamation, the other to charge Jakubowicz with promoting drugs and vilifying the regime. Commenting on being threatened, with Ch√°vez saying that he should be in prison, Jakubowicz said \\"even if they haven't banned the film, they're engaging in a kind of indirect censorship. How will future Venezuelan artists feel about expressing their opinions when [authorities] want to put us in jail even though we never attacked them, or even spoke ill of them at any time?\\" The controversies made the film more popular in the box office, becoming the second highest grossing film shown in Venezuela ever (behind Shrek 2), earning $2.5 million by November 2005.

At the simplest level, in pre-settlement times, Illinois had two watersheds: the Mississippi River and Lake Michigan, with almost the entire State draining to the Mississippi, except for a small area within a few miles of the Lake. This has been complicated by modifications around Lake Michigan, making the Lake itself to some extent a part of the Mississippi watershed. Although it would now be correct to describe Illinois as part of the Mississippi watershed, such classification would not be particularly useful for locating bodies of water within the State. The following lists are based on the method of subdividing the State that is followed by the Illinois State Water Survey. Any body of water in Illinois can be located within this system. The Mississippi and Ohio Rivers contain many small, direct tributaries, such as Marys River, which are not considered separate \\"watersheds\\" under this system. These small, direct tributaries to the main rivers are considered to be part of the \\"Mississippi watershed\\" or \\"Ohio watershed\\". A list of the small, direct tributaries that have articles in Wikipedia is also shown. This list can be used in conjunction with the alphabetical List of rivers of Illinois. Each of the articles about rivers in Illinois should locate that river within the list of watersheds.

Numbers indicate years before present. The indigenous peoples of the Americas are held by modern scientists to descend from the Paleo-Indians, who migrated from North Asia to Alaska via the Beringia land bridge, and not from the Middle East as claimed by the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon, the founding document of the Latter Day Saint movement and one of the four books of scripture of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), is an account of three groups of people. According to the book, two of these groups originated from ancient Israel. There is generally no direct support amongst mainstream historians and archaeologists for the historicity of the Book of Mormon. Since the late 1990s pioneering work of Luigi Luca Cavalli- Sforza and others, scientists have developed techniques that attempt to use genetic markers to indicate the ethnic background and history of individual people. The data developed by these mainstream scientists tell us that the Native Americans have very distinctive DNA markers, and that some of them are most similar, among old world populations, to the DNA of people anciently associated with the Altay Mountains area of central Asia. These evidences from a genetic perspective agree with a large body of archaeological, anthropological, and linguistic conclusions that Native American peoples' ancestors migrated from Asia at the latest 16,500‚Äì13,000 years ago. (See Settlement of the Americas and Genetic history of indigenous peoples of the Americas). The mainstream scientific consensus about the origin of the ancient Americans and peoples is at odds with the claims put forth in the Book of Mormon, though Mormon apologists have made efforts to reconcile these contradictions. The LDS Church released an essay on their website titled \\"Book of Mormon and DNA Studies\\". The conclusion states, \\"Much as critics and defenders of the Book of Mormon would like to use DNA studies to support their views, the evidence is simply inconclusive.\\" Overview of the genetic challenges to the Book of Mormon story =The genetic challenge= The understanding of Joseph Smith and of traditional Mormonism is that the Book of Mormon reveals that the American Indians are descendants of the Lamanites, who descended from Lehi and are therefore a \\"remnant of the House of Israel.\\" =Researchers compare existing genetic evidence with the Book of Mormon story= Mormon researchers such as anthropologist Thomas W. Murphy and ex- Mormon plant geneticist Simon Southerton state that the substantial collection of Native American genetic markers now available are not consistent with any detectable presence of ancestors from the ancient Middle East. They have argued that this poses substantial evidence to contradict the account in the Book of Mormon. Both Murphy and Southerton have published their views on this subject . The arguments of both Murphy and Southerton were disputed by David G. Stewart in a 2006 edition of FARMS Review. =Followup of genetic claims in the media= Southerton's work was later used as a source for a 2006 article written by William Lobdell and published in the Los Angeles Times, which stated: \\"For Mormons, the lack of discernible Hebrew blood in Native Americans is no minor collision between faith and science. It burrows into the historical foundations of the Book of Mormon, a 175-year-old transcription that the church regards as literal and without error.\\"Lobdell, William. \\"Bedrock of a Faith Is Jolted\\" , Los Angeles Times, 16 February 2006 Lobdell's article prompted a response from Latter-day Saint supporters, including several articles referenced on the official LDS Church's web site. The origin of groups described in the Book of Mormon =Statements regarding the Hebrew ancestry of Book of Mormon people= LDS Church leaders have long equated Amerindians with Lamanites. In the Doctrine and Covenants, revelations delivered by Joseph Smith refer to native people in the United States as \\"Lamanites\\".Doctrine and Covenants 28:8‚Äì9, 14; 32:2; 54:8. Smith reported that when the golden plates were revealed to him in New York, an angel told him that the plates contained \\"an account of the former inhabitants of this continent, and the source from whence they sprang.\\"Joseph Smith‚ÄìHistory 1:34. Brigham Young and other 19th-century church leaders generally equated Lamanites with the native Indians of the Americas.See, e.g., ; ; In the October 1959 church general conference, apostle Spencer W. Kimball stated: \\"Millions of you have blood relatively unmixed with Gentiles. Columbus called you 'Indians,' thinking he had reached the East Indies. ... The Lord calls you 'Lamanites,' a name which has a pleasant ring, for many of the grandest people ever to live upon the earth were so called. In a limited sense, the name signifies the descendants of Laman and Lemuel, sons of your first American parent, Lehi; but you undoubtedly possess also the blood of the other sons, Sam, Nephi, and Jacob. And you likely have some Jewish blood from Mulek, son of Zedekiah, king of Judah (Hel. 6:10). ... You came from Jerusalem in its days of tribulation. You are of royal blood, a loved people of the Lord. In your veins flows the blood of prophets and statesmen\\".Spencer W. Kimball, \\"To You ... Our Kinsmen\\", Conference Report, October 1959, pp. 57-62. Similarly, at a 1971 Lamanite Youth Conference, Kimball stated: \\"With pride I tell those who come to my office that a Lamanite is a descendant of one Lehi who left Jerusalem six hundred years before Christ and with his family crossed the mighty deep and landed in America. And Lehi and his family became the ancestors of all of the Indian and Mestizo tribes in North and South and Central America and in the islands of the sea\\".Spencer W. Kimball, \\"Of Royal Blood\\" , Ensign, July 1971. Ted E. Brewerton, a general authority of the LDS Church, stated in 1995: \\"Many migratory groups came to the Americas, but none was as important as the three mentioned in the Book of Mormon. The blood of these people flows in the veins of the Blackfoot and the Blood Indians of Alberta, Canada; in the Navajo and the Apache of the American Southwest; the Inca of western South America; the Aztec of Mexico; the Maya of Guatemala; and in other native American groups in the Western Hemisphere and the Pacific islands\\".Ted E. Brewerton, \\"The Book of Mormon: A Sacred Ancient Record\\" , Ensign, November 1995. An introductory paragraph added to the Book of Mormon in the LDS Church's 1981 edition stated in part: \\"After thousands of years, all were destroyed except the Lamanites, and they are the principal ancestors of the American Indians.\\"Stack, Peggy Fletcher. \\"Single word change in Book of Mormon speaks volumes\\", Salt Lake Tribune, 08 November 2007Moore, Carrie A. \\"Debate renewed with change in Book of Mormon introduction\\" , Deseret News, 08 November 2007 In a 2006 edition, the statement was altered to indicate that \\"the Lamanites ... are among the ancestors of the American Indians.\\" This change, church leaders said, was in harmony with the claims of the Book of Mormon itself, and what some Latter-day Saints had long perceived. For instance, in 1929 Anthony W. Ivins, of the LDS Church's First Presidency, cautioned church members: \\"We must be careful in the conclusions that we reach. The Book of Mormon teaches the history of three distinct peoples ... who came from the old world to this continent. It does not tell us that there was no one here before them. It does not tell us that people did not come after. And so if discoveries are made which suggest differences in race origins, it can very easily be accounted for, and reasonably, for we do believe that other people came to this continent. A thousand years had elapsed from the time the Book of Mormon closed until the discovery of America, and we know that other people came to America during that period.\\"Anthony W. Ivins, Conference Report, April 1929, p. 15 =The origin of the Jaredites= According to the Book of Mormon, the Jaredites were a group of people that left the Old World after the fall of the Tower of Babel. Some Mormon researchers believe that Jaredite survivors of the war that destroyed their civilization, as described in the Book of Ether, could be ancestors to some Native Americans . Some writers theorized that American Indians received their Asiatic genetic heritage from the Jaredites . =Nephites and Lamanites in the Book of Mormon= According to the Book of Mormon, the terms \\"Nephites\\" and \\"Lamanites\\" actually lose their original significance pursuant to the visitation of Jesus Christ to the American continent after his resurrection; his coming ushered in a period of peace in which the two conflicting nations merged into one, in which \\"[t]here were no robbers, nor murderers, neither were there Lamanites, nor any manner of -ites; but they were in one, the children of Christ, and heirs to the kingdom of God.\\" (). Later on in the narrative, as members of the unified nation fell away from the faith, the term \\"Lamanite\\" comes to signify wickedness rather than blood heritage, whereas \\"Nephite\\" came to signify a follower of Christ; both terms alluded to the previous nations' predominant moral tendencies. Eventually, however, even the righteous \\"Nephites\\" grew proud and fell into wickedness more severe than that of those termed Lamanites. The Nephites battled with the Lamanites until around AD 400, near the close of the Book of Mormon, the Nephites were annihilated by the Lamanites. The nation of the Lamanites is understood to have continued on beyond the close of the Book of Mormon. Response to the genetic challenge from Book of Mormon defenders =Book of Mormon population models= Defenders of the Book of Mormon have made arguments that center on the idea that the Book of Mormon peoples from the Middle East formed only a small contribution to the population of the Americas, and that their genetic heritage may have been diluted beyond what can now be detected. The Limited Geography Model of the Book of Mormon supports this position. This geographical and population model was formally published in an official LDS Church magazine, The Ensign, in a two-part series published in September and October 1984.; Critics of the Limited Geography Model say that the Book of Mormon does not make clear reference to any other group of people that may have existed in the Americas alongside Book of Mormon people that would account for the dilution of the Middle Eastern genetic markers in the New World.{} Therefore, it is argued, a \\"traditional reading\\" of the Book of Mormon suggests that \\"most, if not all\\" of the ancestry of the pre-Columbian inhabitants of the Americas came from this Hebrew migration in ancient times .Regarding the hemispheric geography model, Southerton states: \\"Since the traditional geography model most closely aligns ... with an uncontrived reading of the Book of Mormon, it is not surprising that it is still the most widely accepted view in the church.\\" According to the Limited Geography Model proponents, the most direct evidence of prior inhabitants was when Lehi's party found domesticated animals when they arrived in the Americas (). Advocates of the mound builder setting for the Book of Mormon maintain that native peoples of Central and South America are predominantly of Asiatic origin. =Factors affecting DNA composition of the New World population= Michael F. Whiting, director of Brigham Young University's DNA Sequencing Center and an associate professor in BYU's Department of Integrative Biology, concluded in his article \\"DNA and the Book of Mormon: A Phylogenetic Perspective\\" that Book of Mormon critics attempting to use DNA \\"have not given us anything that would pass the muster of peer review by scientists in this field, because they have ignored the real complexity of the issues involved. Further, they have overlooked the entire concept of hypothesis testing in science and believe that just because they label their results as 'based on DNA,' they have somehow proved that the results are accurate or that they have designed the experiment correctly. At best, they have demonstrated that the global colonization hypothesis is an oversimplified interpretation of the Book of Mormon. At worst, they have misrepresented themselves and the evidence in the pursuit of other agendas.\\" Additionally, although he admits the usefulness of population genetics and of DNA in inferring historical events, he contests that, \\"given the complexities of genetic drift, founder effect, and introgression, the observation that Native Americans have a preponderance of Asian genes does not conclusively demonstrate that they are therefore not descendants of the Lamanite lineage, because we do not know what genetic signature that Lamanite lineage possessed at the conclusion of the Book of Mormon record.\\" Lastly, he concludes, \\"[There is] a strong possibility that there was substantial introgression of genes from other human populations into the genetic heritage of the Nephites and Lamanites, such that a unique genetic marker to identify someone unambiguously as a Lamanite, if it ever existed, was quickly lost.\\" and that, \\"[t]here are some very good scientific reasons for why the Book of Mormon is neither easily corroborated nor refuted by DNA evidence, and current attempts to do so are based on dubious science\\" . Murphy has responded to Whiting's comments as follows: \\"While Whiting, in his presentation for FARMS at BYU, exclaimed delight at the prospect of evolutionary biology coming to the defense of the Book of Mormon, he offered no scientific data to substantiate an Israelite origin of indigenous peoples anywhere in the Americas. In fact, he conceded, 'current genetic evidence suggests that Native Americans have a genetic history representative of Asia and not the Middle East.'\\" Murphy further states: \\"One of the most surprising critiques to emerge was the false allegation that I am evading peer review or that the research I reviewed would not stand up to peer review ... [T]he article [\\"Lamanite Genesis, Genealogy, and Genetics\\"] was a summary of genetic research on Native American origins, nearly all of which had been subjected to peer review prior to publication in leading scientific journals such as American Journal of Human Genetics, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, and American Journal of Physical Anthropology ... Whiting's and Lambert's claims are little more than an inaccurate projection of the inadequacies of LDS apologetics onto my publications.\\" =Response to West Eurasian origins= In November 2013 Nature published a discovery on an Upper Paleolithic Siberian site linking Western Eurasians in the Middle East and Europe to the indigenous Native American population. According to the study the genomes sequenced show distinct genetic markers that are unique to the indigenous Native Americans and western Eurasia, but with no relation to East Asians. The study indicates that 14 to 38% of Native American ancestry may originate through this gene flow. One of the authors, Professor Kelly Graf, explained the significance of this, stating that: > Our findings are significant at two levels. First, it shows that Upper > Paleolithic Siberians came from a cosmopolitan population of early modern > humans that spread out of Africa to Europe and Central and South Asia. > Second, Paleoindian skeletons like Buhl Woman with phenotypic traits > atypical of modern-day indigenous Americans can be explained as having a > direct historical connection to Upper Paleolithic Siberia. Book of Mormon defenders have responded to the article with reservation. While the descendants of Lehi would carry similar genetic markers, defenders have pointed out that the genome would have already been in the Western Hemisphere far earlier than the Book of Mormon claims.

Early years  Clinton Clarence Hartung was born in Hondo, Texas, on August 10, 1922. His hometown was the source of his nickname, \\"the Hondo Hurricane.\\" He stood and weighed . His high school team won a state baseball championship in 1939.  Baseball career  Originally signed for the Minneapolis Millers, Hartung played for the Eau Claire Bears of the Northern League for two months in 1942, hitting .358 and winning three games as a pitcher. He was then drafted into the Army Air Forces, where he spent the duration of World War II playing on military teams such as the Hickam Field Bombers; for the latter he went 25‚Äì0 as a pitcher and batted .567. A year before his demobilization, the Giants signed him for $35,000, a very high sum, and expectations were proportionally high: Sportswriter Tom Meany later said of him, \\"Rather than stop at the Polo Grounds they should have taken him straight to Cooperstown.\\"New York City Baseball: The Last Golden Age, Harvey Frommer Other reports hailed him as the second coming of Babe Ruth; \\"he could hit a ball 700 feet and had a bazooka for an arm,\\" James S. Hirsch summed up the exaggerations of Hartung's ability. In he finally debuted in the major leagues, but his performance under these conditions quickly proved less stellar. His first season he only managed 9‚Äì7 pitching and .306 hitting. In 1948 his stats declined to 8‚Äì8 and .179; his pitching never recovered, and was his last year in that job for the Giants, while his hitting did recover somewhat but he never achieved anything like his earlier numbers. As with some other phenoms, he was noted for doing much better in spring training than he would in the regular season. His fielding was never good, and reportedly he was unable to hit curveballs. After 1950, he was relieved of his duties as a pitcher and was switched to the outfield‚Äîa very rare position shift in the major leagues. Hartung was the 11th player in history whose first homer in the majors was as a pitcher to later hit a home run as a position player; the previous player to do so was Babe Ruth, but the next was not until Rick Ankiel repeated the feat in the 2000s. He was at least present, though passively, as the pinch runner at third base in the 1951 play known as the Shot Heard 'Round the World. By 1953 he was back in the minor leagues, playing for the AAA Minneapolis Millers. In 1954 and 1955, he played mostly for the Cincinnati Redlegs' AAA farm team the Havana Sugar Kings of the International League. In 1955, he also briefly played for the Nashville Volunteers of the Southern Association, and the Oakland Oaks of the Pacific Coast League. He played for the Plymouth (Oil Company) Oilers, a nationally known semi-pro team in Sinton, Texas, for several years after leaving the minor leagues, including the summer of 1956, the same year Don Larsen pitched his perfect World Series game against the Dodgers. The baseball statistical reference by Bill James commemorates Hartung with its \\"Clint Hartung Award\\", for the most overhyped rookie of each decade (and honors him with one for the 1940s), and baseball-themed musician Terry Cashman wrote a song called \\"The Hondo Hurricane\\". Hartung died at his home in Sinton, Texas July 8, 2010.

The 'Petit Brak' was the king or seigneur of the Kingdom of Biffeche, with his capital compound at Maka on the Senegal River, near Saint-Louis, Senegal. The kingdoms of Waalo and Biffeche were labelled as 'Brak' or 'Braque' on some French maps of the area, not to be confused with the moorish realm of Brakna north of the Senegal River. Waalo was conquered by the French in the mid-19th century. The Braks of Waalo were chosen from three leading families of Dyoos, Teedyo and Logar, and ruled through a council consisting of various officials with specific delegated functions. It has been claimed that the Brak of Waalo ruled through a local kind of African traditional democracy, but the rulership had definite patrilineal and matrilineal hereditary restrictions. They claimed descent from the legendary first Brak of Waalo and Jolof, Ndiadiane Ndiaye.

Brak appeared alongside his twin brother Sisto in such episodes as \\"The Lure\\" and \\"The Looters\\", and was also a member of the Council of Doom (an organization of Space Ghost villains which originally consisted of Zorak, Moltar, Metallus, Creature King, Black Widow, and himself). In the 1990s the Brak character re-appeared on Cartoon Network's animated talk show Space Ghost Coast to Coast, and then became the main character in its spin-off The Brak Show also on Cartoon Network. The last two incarnations of Brak's character changed from an evil genius supervillain into a childlike simpleton. It was confirmed in Cartoon Planet that Brak is a dunce because he suffered brain damage after being thrown into a swarm of Pirranamyte in the Space Ghost episode \\"The Lure\\". Voice actors Brak's voice was provided by Keye Luke in the original 1966 animated series and Sisto's voice was provided by Don Messick. In the premiere episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast (in the Beavis and Butt-head parody) Brak and Sisto were both voiced by C. Martin Croker. In all appearances after that episode, Brak has been voiced by Andy Merrill. Space Ghost (1966) Brak first appeared along with his brother Sisto as villains on the 1966 Hanna-Barbera cartoon Space Ghost. The two were portrayed as cat-like alien space pirates trying to conquer the galaxy. Brak and Sisto were the main adversaries in the episodes \\"The Lure\\" and \\"The Looters\\", and the duo were also featured during the six-part Council of Doom storyline (primarily in the episode \\"The Two Faces of Doom\\"). Brak was voiced by Keye Luke for all of his original Space Ghost appearances. In the episode \\"The Lure\\", Brak and Sisto had cat-like whiskers. Space Ghost Coast to Coast and Cartoon Planet Brak and his brother Sisto returned in the premiere episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast in 1994, appearing as a parody of Beavis and Butt-Head. Brak would continue to make frequent appearances on Space Ghost Coast to Coast, often just yelling short phrases like \\"All hail Brak!!!\\" or \\"Hi, my name is Brak!!\\". His character would develop more of a personality (as well as an expanded vocabulary) on the spin-off program Cartoon Planet, which premiered on TBS in 1995. Brak was voiced by C. Martin Croker in the first episode of Space Ghost Coast to Coast, but Andy Merrill took over the role for the series, as well as all of Brak's subsequent Cartoon Network/Adult Swim appearances. In response to a viewer's letter read on an episode of Cartoon Planet, Brak revealed that his current level of stupidity was the after-effect of being thrown into a space dust cloud by Space Ghost at the end of \\"The Lure\\". Cartoon Network's write-up for Brak explained: \\"This toothy, mask- wearing former pirate made his first TV appearance on Space Ghost. It was during this adventure that Brak was irradiated by Pirranamyte, releasing him from the burden of intelligence. Now armed only with his meager wits and the love of a peppy tune, Brak happily entertains fans and annoys his co-stars with equal aplomb. He will continue to do so as long as he receives a steady diet of pineapple and processed meats.\\" The Brak Show In 2000, Brak hosted two hour-long Sonny & Cher-style variety specials entitled Brak Presents The Brak Show Starring Brak. These specials were intended to test the waters for a Brak spin-off show, but they received only a lukewarm reception from viewers and fans. A pilot for The Brak Show premiered unannounced at a very early hour on December 21, 2000. In this new program, a parody of traditional sitcoms such as Leave It to Beaver, Brak plays a suburban teen living with his parents and brother and hanging out with his friend Zorak. This version of Brak is even more childlike and friendly than any previous depiction of him. The Brak Show was added to the regular Adult Swim line-up on September 2, 2001. In addition to Brak's family and Zorak, new characters such as Brak's robot neighbor Thundercleese were added. The Brak Show would run for two seasons on Adult Swim and a third, shorter season of webisodes on the Adult Swim website. Cartoon Planet 2012 On March 30, 2012, Cartoon Network launched a new version of Cartoon Planet which focused on showing the network's cartoons from the 1990s and 2000s. Brak and Zorak were brought back as hosts. Throughout the characters' dialogue, it is revealed that the original Space Ghost show is considered canon, preceding the events of the show.  Other appearances  In 1999, the comedic singer Luke Ski released \\"Baby Got Brak\\" on his album Carpe Dementia, parodying \\"Baby Got Back\\" by Sir Mix-a-Lot and the cast of Space Ghost Coast to Coast.https://lukeski.bandcamp.com/track/baby-got-brak On January 15, 2000, Cartoon Network had an election known as \\"Cartoon Campaign\\", where viewers could vote online for a popular cartoon character to be president. Brak was one of the contenders to be nominated. On Sunday, March 19, 2000, the winner of the election was announced to be Scooby-Doo, who received 17.4% of the more than three quarters of a million votes received, followed by The Powerpuff Girls with 11.1% and Bugs Bunny with 8.6%. A mini- marathon of Scooby-Doo cartoons celebrated the election winner on Sunday, March 19, 2000. Around 2000, Cartoon Network aired a parody of Survivor called \\"Staylongers\\", where Brak and other cartoon characters, were on an island and they had to decide who would get to be voted off. Brak ended up not getting voted off the island and won the event. A \\"Staylongers\\" segment was included as a bonus feature on The Powerpuff Girls complete series DVD set, on disc 2, side B. In 2001, Space Ghost, Moltar, Zorak, Mojo Jojo and Brak interviewed professional soccer player Hugo S√°nchez on the Latin America Cartoon Network channel. In 2003, Moltar and Eustace (Courage the Cowardly Dog) interviewed goalkeeper √ìscar P√©rez Rojas. These were done in the style of Space Ghost Coast to Coast. In the summer of 2002, Brak made appearances advertising The Powerpuff Girls Movie and Austin Powers in Goldmember. On New Year's Eve, 2002, Adult Swim celebrated the holiday by having Brak and Carl Brutananadilewski (Aqua Teen Hunger Force) host a New Year's Eve special from 11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.https://www.awn.com/news/carl-and-brak-team-adult- swims-new-years-eve-bash In 2003, Brak started to appear on Adult Swim bumps titled \\"Adult Swim News\\", where Brak updated viewers on the Adult Swim schedule. On February 9, 2003, after the NBA all star game, Adult Swim aired a block on the TNT Network called \\"Adult Swim All-Star Extravaganza\\", as a one- time special from 11:00 p.m. to 12:15 a.m. ET. It had bumps featuring Carl and Brak.http://www.animationmagazine.net/tv/adult-swim-takes-the-court-on-tnt/ On New Year's Eve 2003, Adult Swim had another New Year's Eve special, this time featuring some of the Adult Swim characters celebrating at Brak's house. It was on this night where The Brak Show was officially cancelled. Adult Swim aired a bump showing Brak and Meatwad reenacting scenes from Pulp Fiction. A crudely-drawn version of Brak can be seen at the end of the 2004 Sealab 2021 episode \\"ASHDTV\\" (season 3, episode 8). In 2018, Brak was featured on the Dr. Demento album Dr. Demento Covered in Punk, covering \\"Institutionalized\\" by the band Suicidal Tendencies.https://www.stereogum.com/1978397/please-enjoy-brak- covering-suicidal-tendencies-institutionalized/music/ See also * List of Space Ghost Coast to Coast characters * The Brak Show References External links Category:Space Ghost characters Category:Television characters introduced in 1966 Category:Male characters in animation Category:Fictional television personalities Category:Hanna-Barbera characters Category:Fictional pirates Category:The Brak Show Category:Space Ghost Coast to Coast Category:Extraterrestrial supervillains Category:Fictional twins Category:Teenage characters in television Category:Talk show characters ","title":"Brak (character)"},{"id":"4874360","title":"Anthea Bell"},{"id":"4874361","text":"King Abdullah University Hospital (), often abbreviated KAUH, is a hospital in Ar Ramtha, Jordan. It is the largest medical structure in the north of the country, serving approximately one million inhabitants from Ramtha, Irbid, Ajloun, Jerash, and Mafraq governorates. It is also the teaching hospital affiliated with Jordan University of Science and Technology (JUST), located within the campus adjacent to the university's Medical Faculties Complex. The hospital is staffed with full-time physicians and surgeons who are faculty members of the JUST Faculty of Medicine, in addition to many others from the Ministry of Health, and the Royal Medical Services (RMS). The overall area of various hospital buildings is 95,583 m¬≤, in addition to a double story car park of 9,000 m¬≤ area. The hospital has a bed capacity of 683 which can be increased to 800 beds in an emergency situation. Structurally, the hospital is composed of a 15 story high-rise building, in which all hospital beds are located, and a 3 story low-rise buildings in which patient clinics, diagnostic and other services are located. The hospital is connected to various health science faculties via the ground floor of the low-rise building. During the COVID-19 pandemic, KAUH was designated by the Jordanian Ministry of Health as the main center for COVID-19 testing and isolation in the north of Jordan and one of 7 such centers in the country. History King Abdullah University Hospital as seen with the JUST Medical Faculties Complex. Built by Acciona at a cost of approximately $120 million, the King Abdullah University Hospital was the culmination of efforts inaugurated by the late King Hussein bin Talal to address the critical lack of central, advanced medical facilities serving the population of Northern Jordan. Though King Hussein laid the cornerstone in a 1994 ceremony, he himself did not live to see the completion of the massive hospital, named after his grandfather, the founder of Transjordan, King Abdullah I. KAUH which was inaugurated by his Majesty King Abdullah II on 28 November 2002, has become, within short period of time, one of the most prominent and reputable non-profit hospitals in Jordan and the region. It opened with founding departments in obstetrics - gynecology, pediatrics, internal medicine, and general and special surgery, in addition to emergency facilities including a medevac heliport. JUST medical, dentistry, and nursing students complete laboratories, practicals, internship, and residency at or in close conjunction with KAUH and its extensive facilities. Departments According to the KAUH official Web site, the hospital includes the following departments: * General Surgery * Special Surgery * Emergency Department * Pediatrics * Obstetrics and Gynecology * Internal Medicine and Dermatology * Cardiac Center * Diagnostic X-Ray * Pathology and Laboratory * Endoscopy Unit * Ophthalmology * Physical Therapy and Rehabilitation * Physiology Function Test * Neuroscience * Nursing * Information System Department Administration Currently, Professor Sa'eb A. Khresat, president of Jordan University of Science and Technology is Chairman of Board of Directors of the hospital, and Prof. Mohammad Alghazo, Professor of urology, is the General Director.

The unit was first raised in 1885 during the North-West Rebellion and disbanded after hostilities ceased. In the 20th century, the unit was operational from 1913 to 1936 and 1941 to 1946. The PAV is now incorporated by amalgamation in the North Saskatchewan Regiment (N Sask R). North-West Rebellion The Prince Albert Volunteers or Prince Albert Rifles were organized in Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, North-West Territories, for service in the Canadian Militia during the North-West Rebellion. \\"Gentleman\\" Joe McKay, an Anglo-M√©tis scout of the North-West Mounted Police was sent to Prince Albert from Fort Carlton to enlist about 20 men as volunteers on 20 March 1885. On the 21st, 22 men were sworn in before Lieutenant-Colonel Alexander Sproat. The volunteers were commanded by Captain Moore, who had retired from the Canadian Militia. On the 23rd they arrived at Fort Carlton and were armed with Snider-Enfield rifles. They saw their only action fighting alongside the police against Gabriel Dumont's M√©tis forces at the Battle of Duck Lake on March 26, 1885, where they suffered the heaviest casualties of combatants involved: of the 41 Volunteers sent, nine were killed. Most of those who died are buried at St. Mary's Anglican Church cemetery just west of Prince Albert. Nine of them were killed at Duck Lake, their bodies left on the field until emissaries from Louis Riel arranged for their safe retrieval by citizens of Prince Albert. For the remainder of the rebellion the Volunteers stayed penned up in the stockade at Prince Albert, safeguarding the community until relieved by General Frederick Middleton and his Northwest Field Force after the Battle of Batoche. All the Volunteers who served during the rebellion received the North West Canada Medal and a grant of of land, or scrip of $80 in lieu. =Members killed at Duck Lake= * Constable Joseph Anderson * Constable James Bakie * Constable Skeffington C. Elliott * Constable Alexander Fisher * Constable Daniel McKenzie * Constable Daniel McPhail * Constable Robert Middleton * Captain John Morton * Corporal William Napier 20th century A infantry unit was again created in Prince Albert on January 2, 1913, named the 52nd Regiment \\"Prince Albert Volunteers\\". The 52nd Regiment was allied with the Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire Light Infantry in England. Like most other Non-Permanent Active Militia (NPAM) units, the 52nd Regiment was not mobilized as a unit in the First World War, but many from the regiment signed up with the 53rd Battalion, CEF. In the post-war reorganization of the NPAM, the 52nd Regiment was merged with 102nd Regiment (Saskatoon Fusiliers) in 1920 and became the 2nd Battalion (Prince Albert Volunteers), the North Saskatchewan Regiment. In 1922 the battalion was granted the perpetuation of the 53rd Battalion. In 1924 the battalion again became a distinct regiment as the Prince Albert Volunteers. The regimental badge was the head of an American bison, in quarter-profile facing the viewer's right, above a scroll with the regiment's name. In 1927, the PAV became allied to the Bedfordshire and Hertfordshire Regiment in England. Nine battle honours from the Great War were granted to the PAV in 1930, in recognition of the service of soldiers recruited by the regiment.General Order 71/30 Bold type indicates honours authorized to be emblazoned on the regimental colour. * Mount Sorrel * Somme, 1916 * Arras, 1917 * Hill 70 * Ypres, 1917 * Amiens * Arras, 1918 * Hindenburg Line * Pursuit to Mons In the 1936 Canadian Militia reorganization, the PAV were merged with the Battleford Light Infantry as the Prince Albert and Battleford Volunteers (PABV). The PABV's work in the early months of the Second World War was recognized in 2015 when the PABV's successor, N Sask R, was granted an honorary distinction to be emblazoned on its regimental colour: the wartime badge of the Regina Rifle Regiment (RRR) with the year dates \\"1944‚Äì45\\" in recognition of the role played by the PABV in the mobilization of the Canadian Active Service Force unit of the RRR.Canadian Forces General Message 032/15 In 1941, the cavalry unit based in the Battlefords, 16th/22nd Saskatchewan Horse (Reserve), was converted to infantry under the name 2nd (Reserve) Battalion, the Battleford Light Infantry (16th/22nd Saskatchewan Horse). The Battlefords personnel from the PABV were transferred to this unit, and the remainder of the PABV in Prince Albert were renamed to the Prince Albert Volunteers once again. On March 5, 1942, the active service 1st Battalion PAV was formed. This battalion was stationed in Vernon, British Columbia, as part of the 19th Infantry Brigade until October 1943, when it was transferred to the 15th Infantry Brigade Group in northern British Columbia. The 15th Brigade was involved in the Terrace mutiny in November 1944. The 1st Battalion PAV was disbanded on November 30, 1945, and the regiment reverted to being a solely militia organization. After the Second World War, 1946, the infantry in the Battlefords and Prince Albert were merged for the second time as the Prince Albert and Battleford Volunteers. After further amalgamations, Prince Albert's infantry subunit is now part of the N Sask R. The mess at the garrison in Prince Albert was renamed in 2014 to the \\"Prince Albert Volunteers Mess\\" (under leadership of Captain Luchia as president of the mess committee) to honour the sacrifices made by those serving the Prince Albert Volunteers.

Publication history Created by Fabian Nicieza and Mark Bagley, Psionex first appeared in New Warriors vol. 1 #4. Fictional character biography Psionex are a group of artificially created superhumans who appeared as enemies of the New Warriors. The members are young people (assumed late teens to early twenties) altered by genetic, chemical, or biosurgical means by Harmon Furmintz of the Genetech Corporation to gain superpowers. They first battle the team of similarly aged heroes known as the New Warriors early in the latter team's career, but are soundly defeated and restrained.New Warriors (Volume One) #4-5 They later violently attempt to escape Genetech's custody, feeling that they are little more than lab specimens, but are again opposed by the Warriors; this battle would lead to the rebirth of Terrax, a former herald of Galactus whose essence had been contained at Genetech. Mathemanic and Impulse volunteer to aid the Warriors against Terrax (Mathemanic out of altruism, Impulse out of battle lust), but both receive severe injuries in the fight; though Mathemanic recovers and returns to his studies of mathematics, Impulse's injuries require him to permanently use a wheelchair, and he is forced to retire his costumed identity.New Warriors (Volume one) #15-17 The rest of Psionex escapes during the battle and go their separate ways. Warriors members Nova and Marvel Boy later check in on Pretty Persuasions at a New York City strip club, and Coronary would return to Genetech voluntarily for help in controlling his powers and possibly returning him to human form. Asylum struck out on her own, resurfacing in Central Park fighting Nova and two other Warriors, Firestar, and Speedball, a fight that ends with the female Asylum's disappearance. Henrique Manuel Gallante, a drug-addicted mutant with powers allowing him to access the Darkforce dimension, takes the name Darkling. Driven mad by his abilities, he attacks New York. Several superheroes are able to convince Gallante to stop, and Gallante disappears into the Darkforce dimension. He later returns to Earth through Asylum's mask. He takes her name and regroups Psionex as \\"heroes\\" under his leadership, including Impulse, whose powers allowed his body to eventually heal its injuries.New Warriors Annual #4 After an extended run of crime-fighting in which much excessive force is used to apprehend criminals, the team becomes wanted by the law after a boy dies in an encounter with Asylum, and Psionex is again opposed by the New Warriors. Though the death is ruled accidental (an undiagnosed heart condition determined as the cause), Asylum eventually takes responsibility and submits to police custody, while the rest of Psionex return to Genetech for observation.New Warriors #52 Mathemanic briefly makes trouble through good intentions, focusing so desperately on the desire to turn back time and prevent the boy's death that he affects the perception of time in the greater NYC area, making it seem that the boy's death and subsequent events had yet to occur. Comforted by the Warriors, Mathemanic accepts that he cannot undo what has already happened and consciously dispels his effect.New Warriors #53 Psionex has not operated as their own team since the second Asylum's departure, though at least one member, Pretty Persuasions, has appeared out of Genetech's custody and at large (in the pages of New Thunderbolts, again employed as an exotic dancer). During the Superhero Civil War, the individual members of Psionex (excepting either incarnation of Asylum) are apprehended by agents of the United States government who are enforcing the Superhuman Registration Act. They choose to join the Thunderbolts to avoid being jailed and are forced into a global conflict against the Grandmaster. Psionex later becomes the Initiative team for MarylandAvengers: The Initiative #26 and sides with Norman Osborn during the Siege of Asgard. Osborn's forces are defeated and the Initiative purged of criminals.Siege #1-4 (January 2010 - May 2010) Members *Pretty Persuasions - Heidi P. Franklin is an exotic dancer who received the ability to amplify the erotic urges of other people, and can manifest a psionic energy whip. She has a history of returning to her career as a dancer whenever Psionex has disbanded; thus she has above-average (though not superhuman) levels of agility and athletic ability maintained by such constant \\"exercise\\". *Coronary - James Sharp is a medical student who became a bio-telepath, capable of inducing different bodily states on other people - vomiting, unconsciousness, etc. For some reason, his genetic alterations also gave his body a crystalline composition, which caused him to shatter when Namorita dropped him from a great height. He later reformed his body when he focused his power inward, allowing himself to control his own bodily state, including making himself intangible and having a minor ability to shapeshift. He can take a form that appears to be made up of jagged glass (this was once permanent, but he has since appeared in his original form). Coronary has gradually increased in size and mass since reforming his body; whether this translates into increased physical ability is unknown. *Mathemanic - Thomas Sorenson is a genius mathematician who received the ability to transmit mathematic figures telepathically, which can have various disabling effects. For example, he forces Firestar to perceive interstellar distances, which effectively rendered her unable to perceive smaller distances. He later turned this power inward, allowing him to make incredible calculations to perform feats that seemingly defied physics, such as manipulating gravity; he once subsconsciously affected the perception of the passage of time in a great number of people, in the futile pursuit of actually reversing time itself. Mathemanic is the least anti-social and criminally minded of the group, though he is somewhat absent-minded and distant in non-academic matters. *Impulse - Dwight Hubbard is a violent former gang member who was granted enhanced reflexes and speed. He wielded poisoned barbs on his gauntlets. He assisted the New Warriors in a battle solely for the violent thrill, but injuries sustained during the battle forced him into a hospital and a wheelchair. Over time, his enhanced metabolism led to a full recovery, and he rejoined Psionex when the team reformed under the second Asylum. *Asylum - The first Asylum was an unnamed mental patient who was imbued with Darkforce energies that converted her body into a psionic mist which caused hallucinations in anyone who touched it. She was later able to use her Darkforce energies as an offensive weapon. She was vulnerable at the one solid part of her body, a golden mask. After being defeated while fighting solo against the New Warriors Nova, Firestar and Speedball, she seemed to dissipate except for her mask, and has not been seen in action since. *Darkling / Asylum - Henrique Manuel Gallante was a drug addict who became mentally disturbed by his mutant ability to access the Darkforce Dimension, claiming that he heard a voice from within the Darkforce. While trying to control his energies, he inadvertently unleashed its powers into and amongst the people of New York City, including other superhumans whose powers were drawn from the Darkforce. Calling himself Darkling, he asserted enough control to face New York's resident superheroes, including members of the New Warriors, Avengers, and Fantastic Four, before ultimately choosing to spend time within the Darkforce Dimension alone to further develop his abilities. Later, Gallante returned to Earth using the original Asylum's mask, taking the identity for himself and reorganizing Psionex as its leader. After accidentally killing a young boy, he voluntarily submitted to police custody, and later to a mental institute to serve a term of undetermined length.

It is one of the most famous and impressive forts in the state and has been known through history as the Sonagir or the \\"golden mount\\".  History  The precise year of its construction is not known. However, it is believed to be have been built between the 8th and the 10th centuries. Jalore was ruled by a Paramara branch in the 10th century. Kirtipala, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of Nadol, established the Jalore line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181 and took the clan name Songara after the place. His son, Samarasimha, succeeded him in 1182. After him, Udayasimha became the ruler. The rule of Udayasimha was a golden period in the history of Jalore. He was a powerful and able ruler. He ruled over a large area. He captured back Nadol and Mandore from the Muslims. In 1228 Iltutmish circled Jalore however Udayasimha offered stiff resistance. He was succeeded by Chachigadeva and Samantasimha respectively. After Samantasimha his son Kanhadadeva became ruler of Jalore. During the reign of Kanhadadeva, Jalore was conquered in 1311 by Ala ud din Khilji, Sultan of Delhi. Jalore was conquered by the Rathore of Ratlam and remained a part of Jodhpur State until it integrated to India.Rathors of Marwar pg.212  Physical features  Jalore fort is perched atop a steep and perpendicular hill. It commands the town from rocky outcrop 336m (1200 ft) high fortified with a wall and bastions with cannon mounted upon them. The fort has four gigantic gates however it is approachable only from one side, after a two-mile (3 km) long serpentine ascent. The approach to the fort is from the north, up a steep, slippery road through three rows of fortification to a single rampart wall 6.1m (20ft) high. It takes an hour to climb up. The fort is built on the lines of traditional Hindu architecture. The Main Poles or Gates Built into the front wall are four mighty gates or pols that lead into the fort: The Suraj Pol, Dhruv Pol, Chand Pol and the Sire Pol. The Suraj Pol or the \\"Sun gate\\" is built so that the first rays of the morning sun enter through this gateway. It is an impressive gate with a small watch tower built over it. The Dhruv Pol is rather simple looking compared to Suraj Pol.  Attractions inside the Fort  The mahal or \\"the residential palace\\" inside the fort is now desolated, and what is left of it are the ruined symmetrical walls with huge rock formations around it. The cut-stone walls of the fort are still intact at many places. There are some drinking water tanks in the fort. =Hindu Temples= There is an old Shiva temple, a temple devoted to Lord Shiva. It was built by Kanhaddev Ruler of Jalore. Same was renovated by Mah Singh Ruler of Jodhpur and built a Samadhi Mandir of Shri Jalandharnath. Recently this temple renovated again by Shri Santinathji Maharaj in 2005 with all facility for devotees. A triple temple dedicated to Amba Mata, Ashapuri and Hanuman (the monkey god) is also located within the fort premises. =The Islamic Mosques= The Kila Masjid (Fort Mosque) within the fort is also noteworthy as they demonstrate the widespread influence of the architectural decorations associated with the Gujarati styles of the period (i.e. late 16th century). This is because it was built by destroying existing Hindu temple. Another shrine in the fort is that of Saint Rehmad Ali Baba. Near the main gate, there is the tomb of Malik Shah, a noted Mohammedan saint. =The Jain Temples= Jalore is also a place of pilgrimage for Jains and the famous Jain temples of Adinath, Mahavira, Parshvnath and Shantinath are located here. The oldest temple is that of Adinath, which existed as far back as in the 8th century. The mandapa was subsequently built in 1182 A.D. by Yasovira, a Srimali vaishya. The temple stands out the most among the dark fort walls and rocky surrounding. Built in white marble this imposing structure is quite a sight. The temple of Parsvanath was built by the ruler of Jalore and then rebuilt in 1785 A.D. This temple has a spectacular toran or an archway and a golden \\"cupola\\" in the hall meant for theatre performances. Built near the Bal Pol, which is situated northwest of the fort. The temple of Mahavira was also known as Chandanavihara Nahadarao, named after a Pratihara ruler and a hero of Jain tradition who built it in the 14th century. The temples of Santinatha and the Ashtapads are believed to have existed in the 13th century.

He was the first acting president of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens, where he implemented the university's first physics curriculum in 1801, and also president of the Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences. His grandson was Major General Montgomery C. Meigs. History Meigs was the 13th and last child of Jonathan Meigs and Elizabeth Hamlin Meigs., Meigs Family History and Genealogy website His older brother was Return J. Meigs, Sr., whose son (Josiah's nephew) was Return J. Meigs, Jr., who served as a United States Senator and Governor of Ohio. After graduating from Yale University in 1778 with a Bachelor of Arts (B.A) degree, Meigs studied law and was (from 1781 to 1784) a Yale tutor in mathematics, natural philosophy and astronomy. Yale class of 1778 included Noah Webster, Joel Barlow, Oliver Wolcott, Uriah Tracy, Zephaniah Swift, Ashur Miller, and Noah Smith.Meigs 1887 : 10 He was admitted to the bar in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1783, and served as New Haven city clerk from 1784 to 1789. During this period he established and published The New Haven Gazette (later known as The New Haven Gazette and the Connecticut Magazine). During his time as Editor he published, on 16 November 1786, General George Washington‚Äôs Papers concerning \\"The Asgill Affair\\" of 1782. When Captain Charles Asgill received a copy of this edition, in London, he immediately wrote a letter of rebuttal to the Editor, on 20 December 1786. Meigs decided not to publish Asgill‚Äôs letter, thereby depriving history of a balanced account of these events. Two hundred and thirty three years later this was rectified by The Journal of Lancaster county's Historical society VOL. 120, NO. 3 Winter 2019 which has devoted the entire issue to this subject. In 1788 Meigs published the first American Medical Journal.Josiah Meigs by Rick Meigs, Meigs Family History and Genealogy website =Career= In 1789 Meigs left New Haven for St. George, Bermuda, where he practiced law and was involved in defending the owners of U.S. vessels that had been captured by British privateers. In 1794 he returned to the United States and took the chair of mathematics and natural philosophy at Yale. As a Republican, he was in conflict with the Federalists who ran Yale.Meigs 1887 : 38-43 He taught there until 1801 when he was chosen as the first acting president of the University of Georgia (UGA) in Athens. His salary at Georgia was fixed at fifteen hundred dollars, and he was given four hundred dollars in moving expenses for his family. At Georgia, Meigs implemented the university's first physics curriculum in 1801. He resigned as president on August 9, 1810, after clashing with the Board of Trustees for the University; however, he continued on in the position of Professor of Mathematics, Natural Philosophy and Chemistry for one more year. John Brown was elected by the Board of Trustees as the new president. After his academic career at UGA, Meigs was appointed Surveyor General by President James Madison in 1812, residing in Cincinnati, Ohio.Meigs 1887 : 62 He then accepted an appointment as Commissioner of the United States General Land Office in Washington, D.C., in 1814. During his tenure at the U.S. Land Office, under Jefferson ,he instituted the nation's first system of daily meteorological observations at the land offices throughout the country which evolved into the National Weather Service . =Societies= During the 1820s, Meigs was a member of the prestigious society, Columbian Institute for the Promotion of Arts and Sciences, who counted among their members former presidents Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams and many prominent men of the day, including well-known representatives of the military, government service, medical and other professions. Meigs was also at one point, the president of the Columbian Institute. He was also one of the original corporators and trustees of Columbian College (now George Washington University), and professor of experimental philosophy there. =Personal= Marker over the grave of Josiah Meigs at Arlington National Cemetery. In 1782, Meigs married Clara Benjamin. Their son Henry Meigs served in the U.S. Congress. Another son, Charles Delucena Meigs, became a prominent obstetrician. Their daughter Clara married John Forsyth, U.S. Secretary of State under Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren. Meigs died on September 4, 1822 and was originally buried in Holmead's Cemetery in Washington, D.C. The cemetery was disbanded and the graves removed, so he was reinterred in Arlington National Cemetery in 1878 in the lot of his grandson, Major General Montgomery C. Meigs. =Legacy= He is remembered at the University of Georgia in the name of the university's highest teaching honor. The university annually recognizes up to five faculty members with the Josiah Meigs Distinguished Teaching Professorship.

Although he gained wide visibility as the nation's \\"baseball doctor\\", Reese reportedly \\"drew no line between rich and poor patients\\". During his long career, the Welsh-born Reese delivered therapy to clients including industrial workers, celebrity athletes, and heads of state. His work brought him considerable recognition within the Welsh-American community during his later years. At the time of his death, Reese was regarded as a national figure, and his death was marked by The New York Times, which printed a detailed obituary.  Early life and career  Reese was born in Rhymney, Wales, to a coal miner who died while Reese was an infant. He was orphaned by the death of his mother a decade later and went to work at the Welsh ironworks. Reese was taken in by an ironworker named Tom Jones, who taught him the trade of \\"bonesetting\\", a term the Welsh used for treatment of strains of muscle and tendon, not the setting of broken bones.Strickler (1984), p. 28. Jones trained Reese until Reese left for the United States in January 1887.Strickler (1984), p. 76. Reese became a coal miner and then roller's helper at Jones & Laughlin Steel in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. He later moved to Youngstown, Ohio, where he took a job at the Brown-Bonnell Mills. Within a few years, he assumed the skilled position of \\"roller\\" at the Mahoning Valley Iron Company. There, his skills as a healer came to the attention of one of the mill's administrators, James A. Campbell, who later became chairman of the board of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company. Campbell encouraged Reese to pursue his medical career full-time.Strickler (1984), p. 99. Reese attended Case University (now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland for three weeks before discontinuing his formal studies in medicine. Despite his lack of formal credentials, Reese's practice continued to grow.  Later career  Reese's viewed his involvement with baseball players as a sideline. He preferred baseball players but worked with other athletes. The primary focus of his practice was treating his one-time colleagues, the mill workers of Youngstown. Reese's unique ability to manipulate muscles and ligaments put working men and ballplayers alike back to work, giving him the reputation of \\"miracle\\" worker in some circles. By the 1920s, Reese was a national phenomenon. As Time magazine wrote: \\"His deft fingers developed Reese into an outstanding and nationally famed expert at rehabilitating errant bones. Especially desired is he of athletes‚Äìprecious professionals require the delicate care of specialists, hardy amateurs must please the alumni regularly‚Äìand many a sports luminary has hastened to Reese as a Good Samaritan\\". His eclectic group of patients included baseball luminaries such as Cy Young, Ty Cobb, Rogers Hornsby, Walter Johnson, and John McGraw. But Reese also treated international leaders such as fellow Welshman Lloyd George. Yet, Reese's growing celebrity never distracted him from the essentially humanitarian nature of his vocation. His compassionate and egalitarian approach to medical care was conveyed in a brief article that appeared in a local newspaper about a year before his death. The article stated: \\"Athletes, theatrical people, rich men, poor men, bakermen, and no, not thieves, but others, in all walks of life have made their way to the home of John D. Reese to have him lay his healing hands on their broken bodies, and restore them to health and usefulness\\". A respected figure within the Welsh- American community, Reese became the recipient of the highest honor bestowed by the American Gorsedd. On June 26, 1926, he was invested with the Druidic degree in an Eisteddfod ceremony held at Youngstown's Wick Park. A local newspaper reported that the event marked \\"the first time this degree had been conferred in this country\\". The ceremony was reportedly \\"a survival of the days of the Druids in Wales\\".  Personal life  Reese and his wife, Sarah, comfortably raised five daughters: Mary Ann, Sarah, Gertrude, Elizabeth and Kathryn. Sarah (his wife) died in 1911.  Death and legacy  Reese's funeral was held at Youngstown's Welsh Congregational Church Reese died in 1931, at his large residence on Youngstown's North Side. He was 76 years old. His death was noted in a front-page article that appeared in the Youngstown Vindicator. Reese's obituary observed that he treated patients as they came in and added that the famous often were forced to stand in line. According to the article, patients paid Reese what they could afford, while widows and orphans of mill workers were not charged for his services. At Reese's funeral service at Youngstown's Welsh Congregational Church, the presiding minister described Reese's contributions in the following terms: \\"He began to serve early in his life and kept on. He was faithful to the end. The only life worth living is the life of service\\". Meanwhile, the New York Times noted that Reese developed his much-vaunted skills during the years of poverty and obscurity that he spent in his native Wales. Youngstown's famous \\"baseball doctor\\" was interred at Youngstown's Oak Hill Cemetery, where his wife, Sarah, had been buried 17 years earlier.  Notes   References  * David L.

It was first climbed on 29 June 1865 by Edward Whymper, Christian Almer and Franz Biner, a fortnight before the fateful first ascent of the Matterhorn. Whymper was unable to climb with his usual guide, Michel Croz, who had to wait for a client in Chamonix. As a result, Whymper hired the services of Christian Almer, who had been with Alfred Wills on the Wetterhorn in 1854. Whymper describes the push for the summit: The second ascent was by Charles Hudson, T. S. Kennedy and Michel Croz via the Moine ridge. The first ascent of the Ar√™te Sans was accomplished by Nicolas Jaeger in 1972.

Subject Eadweard Muybridge was an English-born photographer who relocated to the American West and was an early pioneer in photographic technology. He photographed well-known landscapes of Yosemite that pushed the aesthetic and technological boundaries of the medium. His early photographic motion studies conducted in association with Leland Stanford led to the earliest moving photographic images. In 1874, Muybridge murdered Major Harry Larkyns (referred to as 'Colonel Harry Larkyns' in this work), whom he suspected of being his wife's lover, and was acquitted by a jury against the instructions of the judge on the ground of justifiable homicide. His trial is well-known because his defense argued that a head injury incurred in a stagecoach accident altered his personality, which modern neuroscientists believe could have been caused by certain types of brain damage. The text included in Glass' work is based on words drawn from the transcripts of the trial and Muybridge's actual letters to his wife. The second act features a slideshow of Muybridge's photographs. While based on historical events in Muybridge's life, the work also comments on aspects of Muybridge's work, melding both themes. Synopsis The form of this work consists of three acts: a play with incidental music, a concert accompanying a slideshow of Muybridge's work, and a dance with musical accompaniment. In total, the piece lasts about 90 minutes. =Act I= Act I is a play that includes three incidental pieces of music that fit into the play. The play recounts Muybridge's murder of Major Harry Larkyns and the trial, with an irreverent tone. The incidental piece \\"A Gentleman's Honor\\", includes words drawn from the actual trial transcript, commentary, and Muybridge's letters. It draws on the incident in which Flora sent Larkyns a portrait of Muybridge's son Florado, seeming to imply that Larkyns could be the father ('Whose baby is this'), and draws on the commentary of spectators ('All that white hair and a long white beard'), as well as referencing Muybridge's carriage accident and his later motion studies ('Horses in the air '). The phrases 'Artificial moonlight' and 'Artificial sky' may refer to techniques used by Muybridge in his landscape technology (overlaying clouds onto his images). Glass notes that he originally conceived the text of A Gentleman's Honor as based on a poem by Muybridge called \\"Circles\\", but Glass reconsidered and asked David Byrne to use material from the trial itself, as well as Muybridge's letters. =Act II= Act II is a violin solo, or \\"concert\\", that either features a figure representing Muybridge in the darkroom in the background or a slideshow of images by Muybridge. Critics have compared the see-saw sounds of the solo violin to a hoe-down or \\"early American\\" sound, although Glass claims this analogy was not necessarily intentional. =Act III= In Act III, the characters from Act I return for a dance (including Muybridge, Flora, Larkyns, and Victorian bystanders). In some productions, the dance features photographs \\"developed\\" in the second half. Composition and premieres The preview of this work premiered in May 1982 at the Royal Palace in Amsterdam for Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands and commissioned by the Holland Festival, and its first public performance was in June 1982 as part of the Holland Festival, for which the work was commissioned. The work was suggested and developed by the Dutch director/designer Rob Malasch. Later, Glass rewrote the piece and renamed it \\"The Photographer: Far from the Truth\\". Though based on Malasch's original premise, this new version of the play was rewritten by Rob Coe. Glass also performed this work as a selection of incidental songs from Act I and the instrumental work in Act III. Glass's distinctive minimalist musical style complements the theme of the opera, since the ideas of repetitive sounds and small changes seem to mirror Muybridge's techniques in his famous motion studies. Despite Muybridge's achievements and this relationship to the composer's work, the work does not necessarily treat the subject of Muybridge's trial reverently, and the dance appears to use the subject as an opportunity to comment on the contradictory mores of Muybridge's own time. Glass has stated that he intended to reflect the idea of a \\"Victorian melodrama\\" in his music. This piece seems to show Glass's transitioning from ensemble works like Einstein on the Beach to more traditional instrumentation in his later works. Glass has stated that using the word \\"minimalist\\" to apply to this work is \\"misleading\\" and would not reflect what the listener would expect to hear. Recording The recording was conceived with the idea that most listeners would not have experienced the stage work. Several pieces were shortened or left off the album entirely, and the order of the music is changed. Only two of the original three incidental pieces contained in Act I are included. The album was released on June 26, 1984 by CBS Records / Epic and is just 42 minutes long (compared to the 90-minute-long original work).

The other is Kenmore East Senior High School. History =Founding= In 1938, a WPA grant of about $700,000 was received from the federal government toward the creation of a separate building for the senior high school on Highland Parkway, and the school district provided over $1M in additional funds. The plot on which the school is situated cost $35,000. The school opened in the fall of 1939 with fifty faculty members and 1,250 pupils. In 1959, Kenmore East High School was opened as the district continued to grow. At that time, the Highland Parkway school officially became Kenmore West High School. Raymond Stewart Frazier (1901‚Äì1998) was appointed of principal of Kenmore West in 1952. =History of the land= The plot is part of what used to be the Philip Pirson homestead, a 75-acre farm.The Town of Tonawanda, by John W. Percy, Arcadia Publishing (1997), pg. 27 =Building expansion and additions= The community continued to grow in the subsequent years, requiring a classroom addition to the west wing of school in 1967‚Äì1968. In the late 1990s, the school district proposed building a new library information center on the west lawn and an athletic complex east of the original gymnasium. Voters narrowly approved funding for the projects in 1997. The additions were designed by Duchscherer Oberst Design, P.C., an architectural firm in Buffalo. Joseph L. Kopec was the lead architect. The library was completed at a cost of about $10 million in the fall of 2000. The design won an award for educational architecture in the summer of 2001. Another capital enhancement to the building occurred after a May 2002 fire in the cafeteria bay, causing a multi-month relocation of the cafeteria to the Old Gym while a new cafeteria was erected, opening January 31, 2003, to an appreciative student body. =Enrollment and leadership= Kenmore West's enrollment grew steadily through about 1970, and reached its peak in 1969 with over 3000 students in grades 10, 11 and 12. Alan Hammon MacGamwell (1926‚Äì2004), a 1944 graduate of the school, was appointed its third principal in 1971, after serving as a teacher, coach and assistant principal in the Ken-Ton Schools. In that era, the school boasted large numbers of National Merit Scholarship winners. In 1969, Kenmore West, under coach Jules Yakapovich, won the Niagara Frontier League Football Championship and drew national attention as theoretical national champions, determined statistically by a computer match-up with a Florida high school team. MacGamwell retired in 1980 and served the Ken-Ton District on the Board of Education. Another Kenmore graduate, Charles Kristich, class of 1955, succeeded him as principal that year. Douglas H. Smith became Principal in December 1994 and led the 9‚Äì12 school building until December 2005. Karen Geelan, former Assistant Principal in the West Seneca School district, was hired as the Principal of grades 9 and 10, and Smith would continue to lead grades 11 and 12. In 2007, Geelan became Lead Principal of the building under Smith's tutelage until he transferred to Benjamin Franklin Middle School in 2008 where he was Principal until his retirement in 2010. Geelan earned an educational doctorate from the University of Buffalo in 2011 and left Kenmore West in June of that year to become the Superintendent of Allegheny Limestone Central Schools. Dean R. Johnson, who had been a Kenmore West Assistant Principal from 2008 to 2011, succeeded Geelan in 2011 as principal of Kenmore West. Dina Ferraraccio, Anne Martell, and Brandon Hafner are currently assistant principals. Brett Banker is the school district's Athletics Director.http://www.ktufsd.org/domain/196 =Declining population= The Kenmore community, like the rest of Western New York, lost population between 1970 and 1990. Enrollment of Kenmore West dipped to a low of under 1,400 students in the early 1990s, and many teachers were laid off. Despite the loss of population, however, Kenmore West continued to be recognized for its achievements. The Ken-Ton population continues to drop, and teachers and support staff continue to be laid off as the district economic climate changes. In the 2016-2017 school year, after the consolidation of Kenmore Middle School, Kenmore West now houses eighth graders as well as ninth, tenth, eleventh, and twelfth graders.http://www.kentonbee.com/news/2016-08-31/Front_Page/KenTon_District_enters_consolidation_year.html Academics In 2013, Kenmore West Senior High School was ranked 74th out of 135 Western New York high schools in terms of academic performance. =International Baccalaureate Program= In January 2011, Kenmore West was designated as an International Baccalaureate (IB) School. They were the second public school in Western New York with this distinction. As of 2016, only two other high schools in Erie County offered the program: Kenmore East High School and City Honors School. By 2015, about 18% of Kenmore West students participate in the IB Diploma Program.

History In the 1950s, the John Menzies Group acquired Smythson, which was at the time also operating under the name \\"Pendragon\\". In 1998, Smythson's then managing director Sarah Elton led a management buyout backed by a private investor. Since then, the business has grown and the company is now operating outlets in the UK, US and France and online through their website. In 2004, Smythson recorded ¬£12m in sales revenues. In early 2005, Smythson shareholders appointed Cavendish Corporate Finance Limited to advise on the disposal of their stake in the business. Besides maximising value for themselves, the shareholders wanted to find a buyer who would protect the heritage of the brand and offer the management team the opportunity to continue to grow. Kelso Place Asset Management and King Street Partners, backed by a consortium of high-net-worth individuals, were identified as the preferred bidders. Sarah Elton commented that she was satisfied with the deal. In mid December 2009, the label was sold for ¬£18 million to Greenwill SA. Jacques Bahbout became Chairman of Smythson. In 2018, Xavier Rougeaux was appointed CEO.

It is a four-lane divided road (albeit with traffic lights) for most of its length. It is known as Mile Strip Road. A small section between U.S. Route 62 (US 62) and NY 5 in Blasdell, however, is a limited-access highway known as the Mile Strip Expressway. It connects to two major expressways, the New York State Thruway (Interstate 90 or I-90) and the Southern Expressway (US 219), by way of interchanges. It serves as a connector road between them and three other major routes, NY 5, US 62, and US 20\\\\. Thus it is very busy not only at rush hours, but also after Buffalo Bills' home football games due to its proximity to Ralph Wilson Stadium. The Mile Strip Expressway was first constructed in the 1960s from NY 5 in Hamburg to US 62 in Blasdell. By 1968, it received its NY 179 designation. This was extended to the Thruway in the next decade and by 2001, was extended to its current eastern terminus at US 20 in Orchard Park. Although never constructed as such, the Mile Strip was intended to be a portion of the Belt Expressway, an outer loop for the city of Buffalo. Route description NY 179 westbound approaching an interchange with NY 5 in Hamburg NY 179 begins at an interchange with NY 5 (Lake Shore Road) near the shores Lake Erie in Woodlawn Beach State Park. NY 179 proceeds eastward through the town of Hamburg as the Mile Strip Expressway, running north as a four-lane boulevard north of a stamping plant, operated by the Ford Motor Company. Just after the stamping plant, NY 179 enters its first interchange, Mile Strip Road, which connects to NY 179 east via a jughandle. Crossing into the town of Blasdell, the expressway crosses over three separate railroad grades consecutively before crossing into downtown Blasdell. In Blasdell, another railroad crosses the freeway after an interchange with Jeffrey Boulevard. A short distance later, NY 179 intersects with US 62 (South Park Avenue), where the expressway ends and NY 179 becomes the four-lane arterial boulevard known as Mile Strip Road. After re-crossing into Hamburg, NY 179 continues eastward as Mile Strip Road, entering a large interchange with the New York State Thruway (I-90 exit 56), which connects via trumpet interchange. After bending northeast, the route crosses over the Thruway, becoming a two-lane commercial street, passing north and south of several strip malls until an intersection with County Route 204 (CR 204; McKinley Parkway). After CR 204, NY 179 passes north of McKinley Mall, proceeding eastward as a four-lane divided boulevard past several residences before bending northeast, intersecting with CR 4 (Abbott Road) in the town of Orchard Park. NY 179 eastbound approaching US 219 in Orchard Park After CR 4, NY 179 proceeds east through Orchard Park as a two-lane boulevard, intersecting the northern terminus of CR 461 (California Road). After crossing under another railroad, NY 179 returns to four-lanes, passing south of several strip malls in Orchard Park. The route soon becomes a divided highway, entering a cloverleaf interchange with US 219 (the Southern Expressway). After the interchange, NY 179 parallels as a four-lane boulevard between several strip malls, soon intersecting with US 20 (Southwestern Boulevard), where NY 179 terminates. CR 460 continues eastward along Mile Strip Road to NY 187. History The Mile Strip Expressway, a highway extending from NY 5 to US 62, was constructed in the mid-1960s and designated as NY 179 by 1968. A short continuation of the expressway east of US 62 providing direct access to New York State Thruway exit 56 was opened to traffic as an extension of NY 179 at some point in the late 1970s or early 1980s. The junction between the expressway and Mile Strip Road was initially a four-way intersection, with Mile Strip Road passing east-west through the intersection and NY 179 entering from the south to connect to Thruway exit 56 to the north. The entirety of Mile Strip Road east of US 62 was initially maintained by Erie County as CR 460. By 2001, the junction between NY 179, Mile Strip Road, and the Thruway was reconfigured into its current design and NY 179 was extended east to its current terminus at US 20. CR 460 was then truncated to US 20 on its western end, transferring maintenance of Mile Strip Road from the Thruway to US 20 to the New York State Department of Transportation. The Mile Strip Expressway was to be part of the Belt Expressway, an outer loop connecting Buffalo and Niagara Falls. This plan was ultimately cancelled. The only two portions of the loop that were constructed are the LaSalle Expressway east of Niagara Falls and the mile-long Mile Strip Expressway.

Some place self-care on a continuum with health care providers at the opposite end to self-care while others see a more complex relationship. In modern medicine, preventive medicine aligns most closely with self-care. A lack of adherence to medical advice or the onset of a mental disorder can make self-care difficult. Self- care is seen as a partial solution to the global rise in health care costs placed on governments. The notion that self-care is a fundamental pillar of health and social care means it is an essential component of a modern health care system governed by regulations and statutes. Self-care is considered a primary form of care for patients with chronic conditions who make many day- to-day decisions or self-manage their illness. Self-management is critical and self-management education complements traditional patient education in primary care to support patients to live the best possible quality of life with their chronic condition. Self-care is learned, purposeful and continuous. In philosophy, self-care refers to the care and cultivation of self in a comprehensive sense, focusing in particular on the soul and the knowledge of self.  Requisites  There are a number of self-care requisites applicable to all humans across all ages and necessary to fundamental human needs. For example, as humans we need to intake sufficient air, water and food; care also needs to be taken with the process of elimination and excrement. There must be a balance between rest and activity as well as between solitude and social activities. The prevention and avoidance of human hazards and participation in social groups are also requisites. Maturity requires the autonomous performance of self-care duties.  The Middle-Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness  According to the Middle-Range Theory of Self-Care of Chronic Illness, self-care is defined as the process of maintaining health through health promoting practices and managing illness and is performed in both healthy and ill states. Self-care is composed by three dimensions: self- care maintenance, self-care monitoring and self-care management. Factors affecting self-care are: experience and skill, motivation, cultural beliefs and values, confidence, habits, functional and cognitive abilities, support from others, and access to care. = Instruments to measure self-care in chronic diseases = Stemming from the theoretical framework many instruments were developed in order to allow clinicians and researchers to measure the concept of self-care in different situations in patients and their caregivers: * Self-Care Heart Failure Index (patient version ‚Äì caregiver contribution) * Self-Care of Hypertension Inventory (patient version) * Self-Care of Diabetes Inventory (patient version ‚Äì caregiver contribution) * Self-Care of Coronary Heart Disease Inventory (patient version) * Self-Care of Chronic Illness Inventory (patient version)  Self-care maintenance  Checking blood pressure at home with an electronic sphygmomanometer. Blood sugar testing for diabetes Asthma inhalers contain a medication that treats the symptoms of asthma Self-care maintenance refers to those behaviors performed to improve well-being, preserve health, or to maintain physical and emotional stability. Self-care maintenance behaviors include illness prevention, illness behaviors, and proper hygiene. =Illness prevention behaviours= Illness prevention measures include tobacco avoidance, exercise, and diet. Tobacco use is the largest preventable cause of death and disease in the US. By avoiding or quitting tobacco use, overall health and quality of life are improved and risk of disease and premature death are reduced. The benefits of regular physical activity may include weight control, reduced risk of chronic disease, strengthened bones and muscles, improved mental health, improved ability to participate in daily activities, and increased chance of living longer. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends 2 hours and thirty minutes of moderate activity each week. Examples of this include brisk walking, swimming, dancing, riding a bike, and even jumping rope. Another important aspect to self care includes eating fresh fruits and vegetables, lean meats and other proteins. Processed foods should be limited. Limiting saturated fats, trans fats, sugars, and sodium will also contribute to a healthy diet. Illness behaviors include taking medication as prescribed and getting vaccinations. When medication is not taken as prescribed, complications can occur. These complications include disease progression, reduced functional abilities, lower quality of life, and increased hospital visits. Vaccination helps protect individuals from serious illnesses and complications related to vaccine-preventable diseases like pneumonia. =Hygiene= Hygiene is another important part of self-care maintenance. Hygienic behaviors include adequate sleep, regular oral care, and hand washing. Getting seven to eight hours of sleep each night can protect physical and mental health. Sleep deficiency increases the risk of heart disease, kidney disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and obesity. Sleep deficiency can also lead to depression, suicide, and risk-taking behavior. Teeth brushing and personal hygiene can prevent infection. = Factors affecting self-care maintenance = Self-care maintenance behaviors can be influenced by external factors, such as access to healthcare and living environments. Social determinants of health play a huge role in how people take care of themselves. Access to care is one major determinant an individual's ability to carry out self-care maintenance behaviors.This includes having access to transportation to visit a health care facility, availability of open hours of offices/clinics, and whether or not the care is affordable. These external factors can determine a person's ability to perform self-care maintenance because a person may not be able to perform a behavior based on its availability. Access to facilities that promote self-care within an individual's living environment is another factor that influences self-care maintenance. An individual's environment determines whether they are able to go to the gym to exercise or go to a grocery store to buy healthy food. Living in a food desert or having limited resources that allow for physical activity would decrease the likelihood of participating in self-care maintenance behaviors. Internal factors, such as motivation, emotions, and cognitive abilities also influence self-care maintenance behaviors. Motivation is often the driving force behind performing self-care maintenance behaviors. A person who is motivated to stay healthy and manage and/or prevent a chronic illness is more likely to be interested in performing maintenance behaviors as aforementioned. Emotions are also indicative of whether a person is going to perform such behaviors. A person with depression is more likely to have a poor dietary intake low in fruits and vegetables, reduced physical activity, and poor medication adherence. An individual with impaired cognitive or functional abilities also has a diminished capacity to perform self-care maintenance behaviors. Some of these behaviors, such as medication adherence, require the ability to maintain a schedule, but someone with memory impairment may have difficulty completing tasks that rely on memory. Additionally, an individual's motivation influences their ability to perform self-care behaviors. Individuals need to be able to plan, set goals, and make appropriate decisions regarding their health needs. In addition, self-care is influenced by an individual's attitude and belief in his or her self-efficacy. Having the confidence to perform an action and to overcome barriers is indicative of success in performing self-care behaviors. Cultural beliefs and values may also influence self-care, for example it may be viewed as highly important in some countries or within certain cultures that value independence. However, in other cultures, self-care may contradict their beliefs and values as they strongly promote a hard-working lifestyle. Certain values have been proved to have an effect on self-care in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus. Social support systems also influence how an individual performs self-care maintenance. Social support systems include family, friends, and support groups. Examples of support groups are religious groups, groups that manage chronic illnesses, or a community group. These support systems can help by providing people to talk to or help make decisions about your care. Self care can also help prevent suicide. Individuals who live with chronic illness acknowledge that shared care can help make living with a chronic illness less stressful. The presence of co-morbid conditions makes performing self-care maintenance behaviors harder to complete. As an example, a patient with diabetes would need to exercise, but if they also have COPD they easily develop shortness of breath which would cause them to stop exercising. It is important to address all symptoms of chronic illnesses that an experiences so that individuals with chronic illnesses can successfully perform self-care maintenance behaviors. Self-care is also taking care of minor ailments, long term conditions, or one's own health after discharge from secondary and tertiary health care. For example, self-care is the recommended treatment for neck pain. Patients who are better informed and more educated possess greater motivation for self- care. Experts and professionals support self-care to enable individuals to undertake enhanced self-care. The recognition and evaluation of symptoms is a key aspect of self-care. The main issues involved with self-care and the onset of illness are medically related such managing drug side effects, emotions and psychological issues, changes to lifestyle and knowledge acquisition to assist in decision-making. Self-care support has crucial enabling value and considerable scope in developing countries with an already overburdened health care system. But it also has an essential role to play in affluent countries where people are becoming more conscious about their health and want to have a greater role in taking care of themselves. To enable people to do enhanced self-care, they can be supported in various ways and by different service providers. = Improving self-care maintenance = Multifaceted interventions that tailor education to the individual are more effective than patient education alone. Approaches used to improve self-care are summarized here. * ‚ÄúTeach-back‚Äù is used to gauge how much information is retained after patient teaching. Teach-back occurs when patients are asked to repeat information that was given to them. The educator checks for gaps in the patient's understanding, reinforces messages, and creates a collaborative conversation with the patient. It is important for individuals with a chronic illness to comprehend and recall information received about their condition. Teach-back education can both educate patients and assess learning. One example of how a provider can initiate teach-back is by asking, ‚ÄúI want to make sure that I explained everything clearly. If you were talking to your neighbor, what would you tell her/him we talked about today‚Äù. This phrase protects the patient's self-esteem while placing responsibility for understanding on both the provider and patient. One study performed showed that patients with heart failure who received teach-back education had a 12% lower readmission rate compared to patients who did not receive teach-back. Although the teach-back method is effective in the short-term, there is little evidence to support its long-term effect. Long-term knowledge retention is crucial for self-care, so further research is needed on this approach. *Habits are automatic responses to commonly encountered situations. One example of a habit is hand washing after restroom use. The main characteristic of a habit is automaticity. A habit is formed when environmental cues result in a behavior with very little conscious deliberation. *Behavioral economics is a subset of the study of economics that examines how cognitive, social, and emotional factors play in role in an individual's economic decisions. Behavioral economics is now influencing the design of healthcare interventions aimed at improving self- care maintenance. Because humans do not always make rational decisions when it comes to self-care, behavioral economics takes into account the complexity and irrationality of human behavior. *Motivational Interviewing is a way to engage people in critically thinking about their self-care needs. MI uses an interviewing style that focuses on the individual's goals and can be used in any context. MI is based on three psychological theories: cognitive dissonance, self-perception, and the transtheoretical model of change. MI is intended to enhance intrinsic motivation for change. *Health coaching is another method of promoting motivation to initiate and maintain behavior change. The health coach facilitates behavior change by emphasizing personal goals, life experiences, and values.  Self-care monitoring  Self-care monitoring is the process of surveillance that involves measurement and perception of bodily changes, or \\"body listening\\". Effective self-care monitoring also requires being able to label and interpret changes in the body as normal or abnormal. Listening to your body and recognizing signs and symptoms, increasing factual knowledge towards disease or illness are all important factors. Being able to interpret and label your symptoms, understanding the process of your disease, and knowing how to act and treat accordingly allows competency in knowing when to seek further medical help. Self-care monitoring consists of both the perception and measurement of symptoms. Symptom perception is the process of monitoring one's body for signs of changing health. This includes body awareness or body listening, recognizing symptoms relevant to health, and interpreting and labeling these symptoms. Changes in health status or body function can be monitored with various tools and technologies. The range and complexity of medical devices used in both hospital and homecare settings are increasing. Certain devices are specific to a common need of a disease process. For example, various types of glucose monitors are used by patients with diabetes to track their blood sugar levels. Other devices can provide a more general set of information, such as a weight scale, blood pressure cuff, pulse oximeter, etc. Less technological tools can include organizers, charts, and diagrams to trend or keep track of things such as amount of calories, mood, vital sign measurements, and more. = Barriers to self-care monitoring = A patient's ability to engage in self-care monitoring greatly impacts the progression of his/her disease. Barriers to monitoring can go unrecognized and end up interfering with effective self-care. Barriers can include knowledge deficits, undesirable self-care regimens, different instructions from multiple providers, and limitations to access related to income or disability. Psychosocial factors such as motivation, anxiety, depression, confidence can also serve as barriers. *Cost of equipment ‚Äì This is a common barrier to self- care monitoring. Certain equipment is needed to monitor symptoms, such as test strips and needles in blood glucose monitoring. The cost of equipment can be expensive for some individuals, so they are less motivated and less likely to keep track of symptoms. *Lack of knowledge ‚Äì With monitoring, it is important to understand what you're looking for and why you're doing it. For example, some individuals may not understand the implications of high blood sugars or high blood pressure. Thus, they don't feel the need to monitor it. Also, if you don't understand the importance of the monitoring, you will not do it. *Fear of outcomes/fear of using equipment ‚Äì In the example of blood glucose monitoring, some people may be afraid of needles, which will deter them from doing fingersticks to read their blood sugar. Other people may have a fear or anxiety of how results may turn out and may avoid them. For example, a person who did not follow a diet to maintain their blood pressure or blood sugar may have a fear that it is already high and thus, does not want to monitor it. *Familial/social support (or lack thereof) ‚Äì Monitoring something implies doing it on a regular/frequent basis. Doing anything consistently sometimes requires reminders or a little encouragement from others. = Improving self- care monitoring = Because self-care monitoring is conducted primarily by patients and their caregivers, it is necessary to work with patients closely on this topic. Providers should assess the current self-care monitoring regimen and build off this to create an individualized plan of care. Knowledge and education specifically designed for the patient's level of understating is central to self-care monitoring. When patients understand the symptoms that correspond with their disease, they can learn to recognize these symptoms early on. Then they can self-manage their disease and prevent complications. Additional research to improve self-care monitoring is underway in the following fields: *Mindfulness: Mindfulness and meditation, when incorporated into a one-day education program for diabetic patients, have been shown to improve diabetic control in a 3-month follow-up in comparison to those who received the education without a focus on mindfulness. *Decision-making: How a patient's decision making capacity can be encouraged/improved with the support of their provider, leading to better self-care monitoring and outcomes. *Self- efficacy: Self-efficacy has been shown to be more closely linked to a patient's ability to perform self-care than health literacy or knowledge. *Wearable technology: How self-care monitoring is evolving with technology like wearable activity monitors.  Self-care management  Self-care management is defined as the response to signs and symptoms when they occur. Self-care management involves the evaluation of physical and emotional changes and deciding if these changes need to be addressed. Changes may occur because of illness, treatment, or the environment. Once treatment is done, it needs to be evaluated to judge whether it would be useful to do again in the future. Treatments are based on the signs and symptoms experienced. Treatments are usually specific to the illness. = Self-care management behaviors = Self- care management includes recognizing symptoms, treating the symptoms, and evaluating the treatment. Self-care management behaviors are symptom- and disease-specific. For example, a patient with asthma may recognize the symptom of shortness of breath. This patient can manage the symptom by using an inhaler and seeing if their breathing improves. A patient with heart failure manages their condition by recognizing symptoms such as swelling and shortness of breath. Self-care management behaviors for heart failure may include taking a water pill, limiting fluid and salt intake, and seeking help from a healthcare provider. Regular self-care monitoring is needed to identify symptoms early and judge the effectiveness of treatments. Some examples include: *Inject insulin in response to high blood sugar and then re-check to evaluate if blood glucose lowered *Use social support and healthy leisure activities to fight feelings of social isolation. This has been shown to be effective for patients with chronic lung disease = Factors affecting self- care management = Access to care: Access to care is a major barrier affecting self-care management. Treatment of symptoms might require consultation with a healthcare provider. Access to the health-care system is largely influenced by providers. Many people suffering from a chronic illness do not have access to providers within the health-care system for several reasons. Three major barriers to care include: insurance coverage, poor access to services, and being unable to afford costs. Without access to trained health care providers, outcomes are typically worse. Financial constraints: Financial barriers impact self-care management. The majority of insurance coverage is provided by employers. Loss of employment is frequently accompanied by loss of health insurance and inability to afford health care. In patients with diabetes and chronic heart disease, financial barriers are associated with poor access to care, poor quality of care, and vascular disease. As a result, these patients have reduced rates of medical assessments, measurements of Hemoglobin A1C (a marker that assesses blood glucose levels over the last 3 months), cholesterol measurements, eye and foot examinations, diabetes education, and aspirin use. Research has found that people in higher social classes are better at self-care management of chronic conditions. In addition, people with lower levels of education often lack resources to effectively engage in self-management behaviors. Age: Elderly patients are more likely to rate their symptoms differently and delay seeking care longer when they have symptoms. For example, an elderly person with heart failure may experience the symptom of shortness of breath differently than someone with heart failure who is younger. There are many reasons contributing to this difference in symptom experience. Providers should be aware of the potential delay in provider-seeking behavior in elderly patients which could worsen their overall condition. Prior experience: Prior experience contributes to the development of skills in self-care management. Experience helps the patient develop cues and patterns that they can remember and follow, leading to reasonable goals and actions in repeat situations. A patient who has skills in self-management knows what to do during repeated symptomatic events. This could lead to them recognizing their symptoms earlier, and seeking a provider sooner. Health care literacy: Health care literacy is another factor affecting self-care management. Health care literacy is the amount of basic health information people are able to understand. Health care literacy is the major variable contributing to differences in patient ratings of self-management support. Successful self-care involves understanding the meaning of changes in one's body. Individuals who can identify changes in their body are then able to come up with options and decide on a course of action. Health education at the patient's literacy level can increase the patient's ability to problem solve, set goals, and acquire skills in applying practical information. A patient's literacy can also affect their rating of healthcare quality. A poor healthcare experience may cause a patient to avoid returning to that same provider. This creates a delay in acute symptom management. Providers must consider health literacy when designing treatment plans that require self- management skills. Co-morbid conditions: A patient with multiple chronic illnesses may experience compounding effects of their illnesses. This can include worsening of one condition by the symptoms or treatment of another. People tend to prioritize one of their conditions. This limits the self-care management of their other illnesses. One condition may have more noticeable symptoms than others. Or the patient may be more emotionally connected to one illness, for example, the one they have had for a long time. If providers are unaware of the effect of having multiple illnesses, the patient's overall health may fail to improve or worsen as a result of therapeutic efforts. = Improving self-care management = There are many ways for patients and healthcare providers to work together to improve patients and caregivers' self-care management. Stoplight and skill teaching allow patients and providers to work together to develop decision-making strategies. 1\\\\. Stoplight is an action plan for the daily treatment of a patient's chronic illness created by the healthcare team and the patient.Pollack, A. N. (2017). Community health paramedicine. Jones & Bartlett Learning. Retrieved from: https://books.google.com/books?id=jm4aDgAAQBAJ&pg;=PT960&lpg;=PT960&dq;=stoplight+action+plan&source;=bl&ots;=2cdEMMl5ZB&sig;=RupYBfmdp2H0x2JNqEWA16HnGos&hl;=en&sa;=X&ved;=0ahUKEwjJtv- Jk-3SAhVG5CYKHflSCpM4ChDoAQguMAQ#v=onepage&q;=stoplight%20action%20plan&f;=false It makes decision making easier by categorizing signs and symptoms and determining the appropriate actions for each set. It separates signs and symptoms into three zones: * Green is the safe zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms are what is typically expected. The patient should continue with their daily self-care tasks, such as taking daily medications and eating a healthy diet.(aafa, n.d.) * Yellow is the caution zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms should be monitored as they are abnormal, but they are not yet dangerous. Some actions may need to be taken in this zone in order to go back to the green zone, for instance taking an additional medication. The patient may need to contact their healthcare team for advice. * Red is the danger zone, meaning the patient's signs and symptoms show that something is dangerously wrong. If in this category the patient needs to take actions to return to the green category, such as taking an emergency medication, as well as contact their healthcare team immediately. They may also need to contact emergency medical assistance. The stoplight plan helps patients to make decisions about what actions to take for different signs and symptoms and when to contact their healthcare team with a problem. The patient and their provider will customize certain signs and symptoms that fit in each stoplight category.(Lung Foundation, n.d.) 2\\\\. Skills teaching is a learning opportunity between a healthcare provider and a patient where a patient learns a skill in self-care unique to his or her chronic illness.Bennett, H. D., Coleman, E. A., Parry, C., Bodenheimer, T., & Chen, E. H. (2009). Health coaching for patients with chronic illness. Family practice management, 17(5), 24-29. Some of these skills may be applied to the daily management of the symptoms of a chronic illness. Other skills may be applied when there is an exacerbation of a symptom. The patient should not only learn the purpose of self-care skills. It is also important to learn when to apply skills in daily management of a chronic illness and how the skill might be modified or changed when the patient experiences an exacerbation of a symptom. For example, a patient newly diagnosed with persistent asthma might learn about taking an oral medicine for daily management, control of chronic symptoms and prevention of an asthma attack. However, there may come a time when the patient might be exposed to an environmental trigger or stress that causes an asthma attack. The patient starts to experience shortness of breath, chest tightness or wheezing. When this unexpected symptom occurs, the skill of taking daily medicines and the medicine that is taken may change. Rather than taking an oral medicine daily, a different medication is needed for quick rescue and relief of symptoms. The rescue medication works quickly with an inhaler. Knowing to choose the right medication and knowing how to take the medicine with an inhaler is a skill that is learned for the self-care management of asthma. In skills teaching, it is important for the patient and provider to discuss skills and address any lingering questions. It is important for the patient to know when and how a skill is to be implemented, and how the skill may need to be changed when the symptom is different from normal. See the summary of tactical and situational skills above. Learning self-care management skills for the first time in the care of a chronic illness is not easy, but with patience, practice, persistence and experience, personal mastery of self-care skills can be achieved.  Support  Self-care support can include the following: * Self-care information on health and human body systems, lifestyle and healthy eating. * Support to capture, manage, interpret, and report observations of daily living (ODLs),Health in Everyday Living Robert Wood Johnson Foundation primer the tracking of trends, and the use of the resulting information as clues for self-care action and decision making. * Information prescriptions providing personalised information and instructions to enable an individual to self-care and take control of their health * Self-care and self-monitoring devices and assistive technology. * Self-care skills and life skills training programmes and courses for people. * Advice from licensed counselors, clinical social workers, psychotherapists, pharmacists, physiotherapists and complementary therapists. * Self-care support networks which can be face to face or virtual, and made up of peers or people who want to provide support to others or receive support and information from others (including a self-care primer for provider/consumer convergence). = Approaches = Senator Kamala Harris talks about her self care during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Self-care practices are shaped by what are seen as the proper lifestyle choices of local communities. Health- related self-care topics include; * General fitness training and physical exercise * Healthy diet, meals, diet foods and fasting * Smoking cessation and avoiding alcohol abuse * Personal hygiene * Life extension * Pain management * Stress management * Self-help and personal development * Self-care portals and the use of health apps A lack of self-care in terms of personal health, hygiene and living conditions is referred to as self-neglect. The use of caregivers and Personal Care Assistants may be needed. An aging population is seeking greater self-care knowledge primarily within families connections and with responsibility usually belonging to the mother. ;Gallery File:USDA Food Pyramid.gifFood pyramid File:Auto -massagem 2.JPGSelf-massage File:2006Taipei101RunUp OSIM Massage.jpgMassage with robotic massage chairs  Philosophy  Michel Foucault understood the art of living (French art de vivre, Latin ars vivendi) and the care of self (French le souci de soi) to be central to philosophy. The third volume of his three-volume study The History of Sexuality is dedicated to this notion. For Foucault, the notion of care for the self (epimeleia heautou) of Ancient Greek and Roman philosophy comprises an attitude towards the self, others and the world, as well as a certain form of attention. For Foucault, the pursuit of the care for one's own well-being also comprises self-knowledge (gn≈çthi seauton).18.Foucault M: Technologies of the Self. Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press; 1988. As cited by: M. Foucault: The Hermeneutics of the Subject: Lectures at the College de France 1981‚Äì1982 Around the same time that Foucault developed his notion of care for the self, the notion of self-care as a revolutionary act in the context of social trauma was developed as a social justice practice in Black feminist thought in the US. Notably, civil rights activist and poet Audre Lorde wrote that in the context of multiple oppressions as a black woman, ‚Äúcaring for myself is not self-indulgence, it is self-preservation, and that is an act of political warfare.‚Äù With the rise of the term in the medical usages, for instance, to combat anxiety, the association with black feminism has fallen away in clinical and popular usage. However, in feminist and queer theory, the link to Lorde and other scholars is retained. The self-care deficit nursing theory was developed by Dorothea Orem between 1959 and 2001. The positively viewed theory explores the use professional care and an orientation towards resources. Under Orem's model self-care has limits when its possibilities have been exhausted therefore making professional care legitimate. These deficits in self-care are seen as shaping the best role a nurse may provide. There are two phases in Orem's self-care: the investigative and decision-making phase, and the production phase.

History  =Inception= The idea was conceived by a young Pakistani civil engineer Malik Aftab Ahmed Khan (Sitara e Jurat), a graduate of NED University, in mid-1950, when an article of his was published by the Military College of Engineering, Risalpur, Pakistan. The article Persian Pipeline also mentioned the method for its protection along the hostile territory by establishing mini battalion-size cantonments along its proposed route through Balochistan/Sindh. The project was conceptualized in 1989 by Rajendra K. Pachauri in partnership with Ali Shams Ardekani and Sarwar Shar, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Iran. Pachauri proposed the plan to both Iranian and Indian governments in . The government of Iran responded positively to the proposal. At the 2012 annual conference of the International Association of Energy Economics, Ardekani backed Pachauri's proposal. =Timeline= Discussions between the governments of Iran and Pakistan started in 1995. A preliminary agreement was signed in 1995. This agreement foresaw construction of a pipeline from South Pars gas field to Karachi in Pakistan. Later Iran made a proposal to extend the pipeline from Pakistan into India. In February 1999, a preliminary agreement between Iran and India was signed. In 2004 the project was revived after the UNDP's report Peace and Prosperity Gas Pipelines by Pakistani petroleum engineer, Gulfaraz Ahmed, was published in December 2003. The report highlighted benefits of the pipeline to Pakistan, India and Iran. In February 2007, India and Pakistan agreed to pay Iran US$4.93 per million British thermal units (US$4.67/GJ) but some details relating to price adjustment remained open to further negotiation. In April 2008, Iran expressed interest in the People's Republic of China's participation in the project. In August 2010, Iran invited Bangladesh to join the project. In 2009, India withdrew from the project over pricing and security issues, and after signing a civilian nuclear deal with the United States in 2008. However, in March 2010 India called on Pakistan and Iran for trilateral talks to be held in May 2010 in Tehran. On 4 September 2012, the project was announced to commence before October 2012 and be completed by December 2014. On 30 January 2013, the Pakistan's federal government approved a deal with Iran for laying the Pakistan's segment of a pipeline. On 27 February 2013, the construction of the Pakistani section was agreed. On 11 March 2013, the construction work on the Pakistani section of the pipeline was inaugurated by president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari and president of Iran Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. According with Javad Owji, managing director of the National Iranian Gas Company, the pipeline in Pakistan is expected to be constructed in 22 months with the participation of Iran. On 27 May 2013, Iranian deputy minister for petroleum, A. Khaledi, in a letter to the Pakistan government expressed concern over the delay in the start of the Pakistani portion of the pipeline. He said that after a government-to-government agreement between the two countries, they were supposed to select entities for the construction of the latter part of the pipeline. Pakistan still hasn't officially nominated Tadbir Energy and local sub-contractors to begin work on the Pakistani half of the pipeline. On 12 June 2013, the newly elected prime minister of Pakistan, Nawaz Sharif, allayed any fears regarding the abandonment of the project and said that the Pakistani government is committed to the fulfillment of the project and targets the first flow of gas from the pipeline in December 2014. The premier also stated that his government is planning to commit to the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India gas pipeline project as well. On 28 November 2013, a 'friendly' country anonymously offers $1 billion to help fund the pipeline. On 10-November-2013, a meeting between Pakistan Federal Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi and Iranian Minister of Petroleum Bijan Namdar Zangeneh held at the Ministry of Petroleum at Tehran. The Pakistani Officials assured their Iranian counterparts that project would continue despite \\"external pressure\\". On 25-Feb-2014, Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Pakistan, Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told the National Assembly that the project for the moment is off the table, he cited international sanctions as the issue, he said \\" In the absence of international sanctions the project can be completed within three years, but the government cannot take it any further at the moment because international sanctions against Iran are a serious issue\\". Pakistan will face the penalty if it failed to lay its side of pipeline till December 2014. Analysts however points at Saudi Arabia's pressure to not to carry out the project. Iran plans to abandon this pipeline project, as per April 2014 news article. During the state visit of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif to Iran in May 2014, both the government stated to remain committed on the completion of the pipeline and also agreed to extend the completion date by one year. However, on 30 May 2014, ISNA news agency quoted Iranian Deputy Oil Minister for International and Trade Affairs Ali Majedi as claiming that the deadline has not been extended as no such agreement was signed during Nawaz Sharif's visit and the deadline to complete is still December, 2014. During the year 2017, India is planning to disassociate from this pipeline project and working on cheaper independent under sea pipe line directly from Iran. As of early 2019, the project remains substantially delayed. While the Iranian section of the pipeline has been completed, the Pakistani section remains under construction and subject to renewed delays thanks to concerns about the US sanctions regime According to Presstv, the Tehran PM urged that both countries should work hand in hand to finish the project. Controversies In January 2010, the United States asked Pakistan to abandon the pipeline project. If canceling the project, Pakistan would receive assistance from the United States for construction of a liquefied natural gas terminal and importing electricity from Tajikistan through Afghanistan's Wakhan Corridor. However, on 16 March 2010 in Ankara, Iran and Pakistan signed an agreement on the pipeline. According to the agreement each country must complete its section by 2014. In July 2011, Iran announced that it has completed construction of its section. If Pakistan does not fulfill its obligation to complete the pipeline on its side by the end of 2014, it will have to pay a daily penalty of $1 million to Iran until completion. On 13 March 2012 Pakistan's ministry of finance announced that private investors were showing diminished interest and that the government might have to impose a tax on consumers, or seek government-to- government arrangements with Iran, China and Russia to build the pipeline. On 29 March it was reported that officials from Pakistan's petroleum ministry would travel to Russia in early April for talks with Gazprom. Then, in a 7 April article the Pakistani daily PakTribune reported that Gazprom would both finance and construct the pipeline. This would require setting aside the Public Procurement Regulatory Authority rules which require international bidding for such a large project. The Economic Coordination Committee would be asked in its next meeting to give such permission. The article also informed that the reason the private consortium no longer would contribute to the project was US opposition. On 15 April 2012, it was reported through unnamed diplomatic sources in Islamabad that Saudi Arabia was offering to deliver an \\"alternative package\\" to Pakistan if the country abandoned its cooperation with Iran. In addition to oil the package would also include a cash loan and oil facility. The news came in connection with a visit to Pakistan by the Saudi deputy foreign minister. On 1 May 2012, it was reported that Pakistan's foreign minister, Hina Rabbani Khar had said that Islamabad will not give in to US pressures to mothball the project and will finish the huge pipeline project \\"at any cost\\" and that the project was in line with the country's national interest. On 29 January 2013, US consul general Michael Dodman threatened Pakistan with economical sanctions if it does not abandon the project. In late October 2013, Sustainable Policy Development Institute published a report in which the proposed pipeline was termed as \\"death sentence\\" for Pakistan. Since the prices in the contract are linked to crude oil prices, the government \\"blatantly ignored the energy dynamics and its pricing while going for this deal\\". The gas sold to Pakistan will be higher priced than the current domestic prices of gas in the country.http://sdpi.org/publications/files/IP-Report.pdf  Route  The length of the pipeline that will be supplied from the South Pars field has been given variously as , , and . It starts from Asalouyeh and stretches through Iran. The Iranian section is known as Iran's seventh cross-country gas pipeline. The first part of this section runs from Asalouyeh to Iranshahr. The second part runs from Iranshahr to the Iran‚ÄìPakistan border. In Pakistan, the length of the pipeline is . It will pass through Baluchistan and Sindh. In Khuzdar, a branch would spur off to Karachi, while the main pipeline will continue towards Multan. From Multan, the pipeline may be expanded to Delhi. The route in Pakistan may be changed if China will participate in the project. As there are concerns over the pipeline being attacked by Baluchi insurgents, an alternative offshore route from Iran to the maritime boundary between India and Pakistan off Kutch was proposed. According to this proposal, from there one branch was to run to Pakistan while other branch to run to Kutch.  Technical description  The initial capacity of the pipeline was to be of natural gas per year, which was expected to be raised later to . However, as a bilateral project between Iran and Pakistan, the pipeline will carry only of gas per year as contracted and as a maximum capacity. The pipeline has a diameter of . It is expected to cost US$7.5 billion and to be commissioned by 2013. It is expected that gas delivered from Iran through the pipeline will cost US compared to which is expected to be price of gas delivered through the proposed Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline and of imported LNG. Authorities blamed Lack of safety measures and old infrastructure for the Thursday explosion in a gas pipeline near the city of Mahshahr in southern Iran. One child, one woman and two others were killed in the explosion.At Least Five Killed In Iran Gas Explosion Companies In different times several companies have been interested to build the pipeline. Companies included Gazprom, BHP Billiton, National Iranian Gas Company, Petronas, and Total S.A.. A consortium consisting of Royal Dutch Shell, BG Group, Petronas and an Iranian business group had negotiated on exporting of gas from South Pars to Pakistan. From India, GAIL had been involved. However, the pipeline's section in Iran was built by the National Iranian Gas Company. It used Khatam al-Anbia as a subcontractor. In Pakistan, Inter State Gas Systems (Pvt.) Limited is responsible for the construction of the pipeline. The contract for engineering, procurement, construction and financing of the Pakistan's section was signed with Iran's Tadbir Energy. Iran agreed to provide a $500 million loan for construction payable in 20 years. However, on 13-December-2013, Pakistan's Minister for Petroleum and Natural Resources Shahid Khaqan Abbasi said that Iran refused to fund the project citing 'acute financial constraint' as the reason. Pakistan authorities however said to remain committed with the project. Both sides have decided to constitute a working group which would re- establish in two months the new parameters for the projects, including a new time-frame and other important issues involving financing of pipeline to be laid down in the territory of Pakistan.http://tribune.com.pk/story/644785/in- limbo-iran-takes-back-pipeline-financing-deal/  See also  * Trans- Afghanistan Pipeline * Iran‚ÄìPakistan relations * List of power stations in Iran * List of power stations in Pakistan * Energy in Iran  References   External links  * Iran-Pakistan-India Pipeline: A View from Washington by Gal Luft, 15 June 2007. * Iran-Pakistan pipeline: Iran‚Äôs new lifeline by Gal Luft, 29 May 2009.

Unlike the younger Sicilian-Americans, known as the \\"Young Turks,\\" the old- guard Mustache Petes had large mustaches and usually committed their first killings in Italy. Their most prominent members were Joe \\"the Boss\\" Masseria (1886‚Äì1931) and Salvatore Maranzano (1886‚Äì1931). Many of them also had connections with the Sicilian Mafia. The Mustache Petes wanted to maintain Sicilian criminal traditions in their new country and were more interested in working with and exploiting their fellow Italians than the public at large. To that end, they opposed their younger members' desire to work with the powerful Jewish and Irish gangs and in drugs. The younger members wanted to branch out since they realizes the numerous other ways in which to make their fortunes, but they were stifled by the Mustache Petes. This annoyed younger caporegimes, such as Lucky Luciano (1897‚Äì1962) and Vito Genovese (1897‚Äì1969). Luciano and other \\"Young Turks\\" in the New York Mafia soon concluded that the Mustache Petes were too set in their ways to see the millions of dollars that working with non-Italian gangsters could bring. During the Castellammarese War (1930‚Äì31), Luciano built a network of younger mafiosi in both the Masseria and Maranzano camps and secretly intended to assassinate one of the older bosses, then bide their time before killing the other. They eventually decided to kill Masseria and feigned loyalty to Maranzano until they had a chance to eliminate him as well. Following the death of Maranzano on September 10, 1931, the newer generation of Italian mobsters reorganized the National Crime Syndicate and founded The Commission, becoming closer to the modern American Mafia. Journalists marked this day as a purge of older mafiosi, known as the \\"Night of the Sicilian Vespers.\\" Several days later, on September 13, the corpses of two other Maranzano allies, Samuel Monaco and Louis Russo, were retrieved from Newark Bay, showing evidence of torture. Meanwhile, Joseph Siragusa, leader of the Pittsburgh crime family, was shot to death in his home.

It is one of the earliest venues of the Parisian philatelic trade, and it was one of the first covered commercial passageways in Europe. Bazaars and souks in the Orient had roofed commercial passageways centuries earlier but the Passage de Panoramas innovated in having glazed roofing and, later on, in 1817, gas lights for illumination. It was an ancestor of the city gallerias of the 19th century and the covered suburban and city shopping malls of the 20th century. The passage was opened in 1800 on the site of the town residence of the Marechal de Montmorency, Duke of Luxembourg, which had been built in 1704. The doorway of the modern building, of the house, which opened on rue Saint-Marc, facing the rue des Panoramas, was the gateway of the original mansion. Its name came from an attraction built on the site; two large rotundas where panoramic paintings of Paris, Toulon, Rome, Jerusalem, and other famous cities were displayed. They were a business venture of the American inventor Robert Fulton, who had come to Paris to offer his latest inventions, the steamboat, submarine, and torpedo, to Napoleon and the French Directory. While waiting for an answer, Fulton earned money from his exhibition. Napoleon, who had little interest in the navy, finally rejected Fulton's projects. Fulton left behind his Panoramas and went to London to offer his inventions to the British. In 1800, Paris streets were narrow, dark, muddy and crowded, and very few had sidewalks or lighting; they were very unpleasant for shopping. The first indoor gallery, at the Palais Royal, had opened in 1786, followed by the passage Feydau in 1790-91, the Passage du Caire in 1799, and the Passage des Panoramas in 1800. . The rotundas were destroyed in 1831. In the 1830s, the architect Jean-Louis Victor Grisart renovated the passage and created three additional galleries inside the block of houses: the Saint-Marc gallery parallel with the passage, the gallery of the Vari√©t√©s which gives access to the entry of the artists of the Th√©√¢tre de Vari√©t√©s, and the Feydeau galleries and Montmartre. Stern the famous engraver settled there in 1834, then merchants of postcards and postage stamps, and some restaurants moved in. The part of the passage close to the Montmartre boulevard is richly decorated, while the distant part is more modest. The passage, as it was in 1867, is described in chapter VII of √âmile Zola's novel Nana.

The game takes place in a post-apocalyptic wasteland located around the American Grand Canyon. Fallen Earth's gameplay features FPS/RPG hybridization, first-person/third person views, hundreds of items, including improvised equipment and weapons, a variety of functional vehicles, a real-time, in-depth crafting system (which includes vehicles), various skills and abilities, factions and tactical PvP, all existing within 1000 square kilometers of usable terrain based on real-world topographical maps of the area. The game was released on September 22, 2009. Two years later, GamersFirst purchased the intellectual property and made the game free to play. It was acquired by the publisher Little Orbit in 2018. Plot The Fallen Earth story begins in the 21st Century, when the first in a series of natural disasters hits the United States. As Americans struggle to recover, an investment tycoon named Brenhauer buys a controlling stake in a mega- corporation named GlobalTech. By 2051, he moves his headquarters to the Grand Canyon Province, where GlobalTech eventually creates a self-sufficient economic and military mini-state. Meanwhile, in India and Pakistan, the Shiva virus, named for the dance-like convulsions that it caused in its victims, appears among the human populace. As the infection starts to spread, countries accuse each other of engineering the virus. Political paranoia turns to open aggression and nuclear conflict. The nuclear conflict combined with the virus devastates the planet. Less than one percent of Earth's population survived the Fall, and the Hoover Dam Garrison and Grand Canyon Province are the only known outposts of human civilization. Outside the protective confines of the Hoover Dam Garrison, the player encounters ruins of the old world, genetically altered creatures, strange technology, and six warring factions. Some factions seek to rebuild the old world, others wish to build a new one in their own image, and some simply desire chaos and anarchy. Gameplay The game world of Fallen Earth is based on a real-world topographical map of the Grand Canyon. The world map covers more than 1000 square kilometres of usable terrain. The environment is zoneless and set in sectors which continue the story-arc of the game, and which can be advanced through at the player's own pace. Parts of the map will be unreachable at release, but will be gradually opened as more content is developed. The game includes first-person and third- person views, a classless system, Player-versus-Player combat, mounted combat, crafting, and a noise-based stealth system. Fallen Earth offers customizable features, including: clothing, facial features, skin tones, hairstyles and colors, age, body and facial hair, body art (tattoos and piercings), height, and makeup. Also after this process players can add points to their character to build strength and other skills. Fallen Earth does not have a fixed class system. It uses skill-based character development with a strong emphasis on flexibility and player preference. The game features active skills‚Äîtrade- skills as well as mutation-based skills‚Äîwhich can be increased through Advancement Points (APs) or skill usage. Advancement Points are earned alongside level experience, and aside from increasing skill points, can also be used to boost Attributes. Players can undo and \\"re-spec\\" their skill point allocation. Combat in Fallen Earth is generally in a first-person shooter format. The camera can be moved to alternate between third and first person modes. Players will need to manually keep their targets in a targeting reticle to actually hit them in combat. Skills can be used to influence combat in different ways, but again, enemies must still be manually targeted. There is no \\"target locking\\" as in other MMOs. There are three main methods of dealing damage in the game. These are broken down by a weapon's effective range. Rifles, pistols, and melee are the primary weapon types. Rifles specialize in long distance damage, but are capable of using some short distance weaponry. Pistols are considered the most balanced of the weapon types, able to do damage at medium to short range. Melee, with its short range, is for close- quarters combat. Fallen Earth has thousands of items as well as equipment and accessories of varying strength for players to craft and equip in up to 22 separate equipment slots. Each piece of equipment varies in weight, and possesses different qualities. Heavier equipment, for example, will generally offer higher defense bonuses, but also increases noise while moving - making stealth more difficult. Fallen Earth allows its players to carry as many as six active weapons which alter the character's appearance. The game also has a variety of vehicles. Players start out neutral in Fallen Earth and can remain neutral or choose to align themselves with a particular faction. Aligning with a faction will give characters a head start in skills and specialized equipment. The game supports PhysX and Vivox, Inc.'s in-game voice communication technology. Development After a number of years in the making, Fallen Earth developers announced in a June 2008 press release that the game had reached feature-complete status. In October 2008, the Fallen Earth website reported that the game had reached content-complete status. The first wave of Alpha tests began in August 2008, and closed Beta testing began in February 2009. As part of a promotional campaign, Fallen Earth announced a National Tour on their website in February 2009. They planned to sponsor IGDA meetings, and participating in events across the United States, doing public demonstrations promoting the game and taking part in question-and-answer sessions with the audience. The game was released on September 22, 2009 with pre-orders from Direct2Drive, Steam and the official website granting early access from September 9, 2009. On March 10, 2010, Icarus Studios announced the beta release of Fallen Earth for the Mac OS X platform. The Mac OS X version of Fallen Earth uses Wine technology and requires an Intel-based Mac system with a discrete graphics processor. On April 5, 2010, the Fallen Earth team announced that Lee Hammock was leaving Fallen Earth to work as story designer on a new MMO title, Gargantuan.http://forums.fallenearth.com/fallenearth/showthread.php?t=36213 On April 30, 2010, Chief Executive Officer of Icarus Studios, Inc., James Hettinger, announced a restructure of the company resources and staffing, effective immediately.http://forums.fallenearth.com/fallenearth/showthread.php?t=37356 Among these changes was the promotion of Fallen Earth writer/content developer Wes Platt to Director of Content Development.

He is known for his bravery in breaking the German blockade of Tobruk in the Second World War with his small schooner Maria Giovanni. During the Second World War he was wounded several times and finally taken prisoner by the Germans, from whom he attempted numerous escapes. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross in 1941 for \\"courage, skill and devotion to duty in operations off the Libyan coast\\", and made a Member of the Order of the British Empire in 1944. Early life Palmer's name at birth was Alfred O'Brien. He first went to sea on the Daniel, a 185-ton sailing vessel built in Norway in 1830. After three voyages to New Zealand on the Daniel in November 1916, Palmer joined the Burrowa, an Australian merchant sailing vessel (2902 gross tonnes). On 27 April Burrowa was attacked and sunk \\"sixty miles west of the Scilly Isles\\" by a German submarine. The crew spent two nights in a lifeboat. They were sighted by a patrol plane, picked up and taken to Penzance. Palmer then served in the British navy until the end of the First World War. Between the First and Second World Wars, Palmer was a merchant seaman serving on many Commonwealth Line ships. He was a crew member of the Carawa when it was run aground in the Gal√°pagos Islands. The crew members returned to Sydney on the steamers Australrange and Australmont in July 1920. In 1928, as the depression began, the Commonwealth line was sold and crews were retrenched. He commanded a company of the Chinese Lancers in Shanghai and was a member of the volunteer reserve. On the outbreak of the Second World War he rejoined the Royal Navy, and first served as executive officer of . Maria Giovanni The Maria Giovanni was a 200-ton schooner captured from the Italians by the British destroyer on 1 January 1941. Palmer was made skipper of the Maria Giovanni in January 1941, and the ship was used to ferry supplies to the beleaguered town of Tobruk. He \\"won fame through his cussedness on the Spud Run\\", and by his willingness to carry any cargo. The supply of Tobruk by Palmer and others was known as the \\"Ferry Service\\". There are slight differences in accounts of how his ship was captured, with one source saying the Italians \\"trapped him by a ruse\\", and the other saying the Germans \\"kidded him\\" to make landfall in their territory. Regardless, Palmer and his crew became prisoners of war in Italy. He was well liked in the POW camps and always had a positive effect on his companions. CNRRA Incident Palmer was accused of embezzlement while working as marine superintendent of waterways transport for the Chinese National Relief and Rehabilitation Administration in 1947. He was convicted and sentenced to one year hard labour, but the conviction was overturned on appeal. Later life Palmer and his wife flew from Florida to Australia to attend a Rats of Tobruk reunion in 1977, where around 600 veterans marched through Sydney streets.

Corcoran (April 4, 1905 ‚Äì June 23, 1977) was a golf tournament director, publicist, agent and business manager. Known around the world as \\"Mr. Golf,\\" he was one of the first non-players to be inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1975. He acted as tournament manager of the PGA in the 1930s, promotion manager in the 1940s; the founder of the LPGA, the Golf Writers Association of America, the Metropolitan Golf Writers Association; tournament director of the Thunderbird and Westchester Classic; and the director of the International Golf Association. In addition to golf, his diverse career also included the world of baseball, boxing, hockey, football as he at one time managed the business affairs of Sam Snead, Ted Williams, Babe Zaharias, Stan Musial, Tony Lema, Ken Venturi, Seve Ballesteros, Tom Weiskopf and Pete Gogolak. Corcoran is honored annually with the Corcoran Cup, a golf tournament featuring the nation's top blind golfers, to raise funds for Guiding Eyes for the Blind, an organization that trains dogs for the visually impaired. He was inducted into the Massachusetts Golf Hall of Fame in 2002. Early life Born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, Corcoran started in golf as a nine-year-old caddie at Belmont Country Club, carrying bags for Francis Ouimet and Alexa Stirling. At the age of 12, he became the youngest caddie master in America, collecting five cents from every boy who carried a bag. As a young man he worked for the Massachusetts Golf Association, with Donald Ross at Pinehurst, and as the official scorer for the United States Golf Association. Among his innovations was the first tournament leaderboard that reflected birdies, pars and bogies, marked in different colored crayons, a method that caught on immediately and is used around the world today. PGA tournament manager, agent In 1936, he became the PGA Tour's tournament manager and the business manager of Sam Snead. During the 1940s, he took golf from a minor curiosity to a major business. He later served as the PGA's Promotions Director until 1948. Both idea man and publicist, with a pinch of hustler thrown in, Corcoran raised the awareness and business of golf through many avenues. In 1940, he put together a charity match between Gene Tunney, Babe Ruth, Gene Sarazen and Jimmy Demaret, where he brought the Fred Waring band and \\"Colonel\\" Stoopnagel, of radio fame, to follow the match with a sound truck, offering an absurd commentary. A year later, he arranged for a three- course match between Ty Cobb and Babe Ruth, which allowed them to settle their long-term rivalry on the golf course. He established golf's first Hall of Fame that year as well. He managed three United States Ryder Cup teams, and was official scorer at 34 USGA championships. During World War II, Corcoran worked for the Red Cross and USO, staging golf exhibitions with the help of Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, and bringing sports shows to the troops with Lefty Gomez and Jack Sharkey. Founds LPGA, GWAA From the mid-1930s to the late 1940s, there was some friction and dispute on the PGA Tour over Corcoran's perceived conflict of interest as a personal manager of certain tour players at the same time he was promoting and running tournaments where those players competed against others. There was also controversy over how Corcoran should be paid for his services to the Tour, and expenses incurred doing his jobs; the Tour was at the time still a loosely run, evolving branch of the PGA of America, with little structure or assigned responsibilities and chain of command for the weekly tournaments around the large country. Few disputed Corcoran's skills and worth, but budgets were tight and prize moneys low in the wake of the Great Depression, and professional golf in the USA was but a shadow of what it would become decades later. Corcoran was fired and re-hired several times during this period, but took the conflict in stride, and emerged with his reputation intact. After World War II, Corcoran helped found the Ladies Professional Golf Association and the Golf Writers Association of America (GWAA). He was well known for providing anecdotes, quotes, and stats to golf writers from a file cabinet inside his head. He worked at the Tournament Director of the LPGA from 1950 to 1954. He also managed the career of Babe Zaharias, entering her into the 1945 Los Angeles Open as the first woman to play a PGA Tour event. He managed golf star Marlene Bauer Hagge, and baseball superstars Ted Williams and Stan Musial. Develops World Cup of Golf Corcoran's own modest, self-described claim to fame is that he three-putted in 48 counties. In 1955, Corcoran took over the ailing Canada Cup, which traveled the globe to promote international goodwill through golf with team and individual championships. The Canada Cup became the World Cup and was played under Corcoran's direction until his death in 1977. The World Cup introduced to the world such international stars as Seve Ballesteros, Greg Norman, Gary Player and Roberto DeVicenzo; it was supported during this period by the top American stars such as Sam Snead, Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, and Lee Trevino, who traveled the world to compete in it. The World Cup became a significant championship, and had an invaluable role in broadening golf's international profile and appeal. Corcoran also worked as Tournament Director for the Thunderbird Classic and the Westchester Classic golf tournaments, which were at the time, the richest in golf. He managed the business of \\"Champagne\\" Tony Lema, Ken Venturi, and Tom Weiskopf. He orchestrated the move from the AFL to the NFL by New York Giant placekicker, Pete Gogolak. In 1975, Corcoran was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in the lifetime achievement category, and he won the William D. Richardson Award in 1960. In 1964, he published his autobiography, Unplayable Lies. His daughter, Judy, updated, reorganized and added to that book as Fred Corcoran: The Man Who Sold the World on Golf in 2011. Corcoran died June 23, 1977, in White Plains, New York from complications of a stroke suffered days earlier at his home in Scarsdale, New York.NYHistory.org, entry for Fred J.

It is an instrument consisting of two rulers of equal length joined by a hinge. A number of scales are inscribed upon the instrument which facilitate various mathematical calculations. It was used for solving problems in proportion, trigonometry, multiplication and division, and for various functions, such as squares and cube roots. Its several scales permitted easy and direct solutions of problems in gunnery, surveying and navigation. The sector derives its name from the fourth proposition of the sixth book of Euclid, where it is demonstrated that similar triangles have their like sides proportional. It has four parts, two legs with a pivot (the articulation), a quadrant and a clamp (the curved part at the end of the leg) that enables the compass to function as a gunner's quadrant. History Galileo's geometrical and military compass, thought to have been made c. 1604 by MazzoleniThe sector was invented, essentially simultaneously and independently, by a number of different people prior to the start of the 17th century. De fabrica et usu menti ad omnia horarum genera describenda (1592), where Giovanni Paolo Gallucci is among the first to describe the sector Cl√©ment Cyriaque de Mangin, Usage du compas de proportion, 1637 Fabrizio Mordente (1532 ‚Äì ca 1608) was an Italian mathematician who is best known for his invention of the \\"proportional eight-pointed compass\\" which has two arms with cursors that allow the solution of problems in measuring the circumference, area and angles of a circle. In 1567 he published a single sheet treatise in Venice showing illustrations of his device. In 1585 Giordano Bruno used Mordente's compass to refute Aristotle's hypothesis on the incommensurability of infinitesimals, thus confirming the existence of the \\"minimum\\" which laid the basis of his own atomic theory. Credit for the invention is often given to either Thomas Hood, a British mathematician, or to the Italian mathematician and astronomer Galileo Galilei. Galileo, with the help of his personal instrument maker Marc'Antonio Mazzoleni, created more than 100 copies of his military compass design and trained students in its use between 1595 and 1598. Of the credited inventors, Galileo is certainly the most famous, and earlier studies usually attributed its invention to him.  The scales  The following is a description of the instrument as it was constructed by Galileo, and for which he wrote a popular manual. The terminating values are arbitrary and varied from manufacturer to manufacturer. =The Arithmetic Lines= The innermost scales of the instrument are called the Arithmetic Lines from their division in arithmetical progression, that is, by equal additions which proceed out to the number 250. It is a linear scale generated by the function f(n) = Ln/250, where n is an integer between 1 and 250, inclusive, and L is the length at mark 250. =The Geometric Lines= The next scales are called the Geometric Lines and are divided in geometric progression out to 50. The lengths on the geometric lines vary as the square root of the labeled values. If L represents the length at 50, then the generating function is: f(n) = L(n/50)^{1/2}, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 50. =The Stereometric Lines= The Stereometric Lines are so called because their divisions are according to the ratios of solid bodies, out to 148. One of this scale's applications is to calculate, when given one side of any solid body, the side of a similar one that has a given volume ratio to the first. If L is the scale length at 148, then the scale-generating function is: f(n) = L(n/148)^{1/3}, where n is a positive integer less than or equal to 148. =The Metallic Lines= These lines have divisions on which appeared these symbols: Au, Pb, Ag, Cu, Fe, Sn, Mar, Sto, (gold, lead, silver, copper, iron, tin, marble, and stone). From these you can get the ratios and differences of specific weight found between the materials. With the instrument set at any opening, the intervals between any correspondingly marked pair of points will give the diameters of balls (or sides of other solid bodies) similar to one another and equal in weight. =The Polygraphic Lines= From the given information, the side length and the number of sides, the Polygraphic lines yield the radius of the circle that will contain the required regular polygon. If the polygon required has n sides, then the central angle opposite one side will be 360/n. =The Tetragonic Lines= Tetragonic Lines are so called from their principal use, which is to square all regular areas and the circle as well. The divisions of this scale use the function: f(n) = L(3^{1/2}\\\\tan(180/n)/n)^{1/2}, between the values of 3 and 13. =The Added Lines= These Added Lines are marked with two series of numbers, of which the outer series begins at a certain mark called D followed by the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on out to 18. The inner series begins from this mark D, going on then to 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, also out to 18. They were used in conjunction with the other scales for a number of complex calculations.  Use  Sector with dividers, probably Dresden, c. 1630 The instrument can be used to graphically solve questions of proportion, and relies on the principle of similar triangles. Its vital feature is a pair of jointed legs, which carry paired geometrical scales. In use, problems are set up using a pair of dividers to determine the appropriate opening of the jointed legs and the answer is taken off directly as a dimension using the dividers. Specialised scales for area, volume and trigonometrical calculations, as well as simpler arithmetical problems were quickly added to the basic design. Different versions of the instrument also took different forms and adopted additional features. The type publicised by Hood was intended for use as a surveying instrument, and included not only sights and a mounting socket for attaching the instrument to a pole or post, but also an arc scale and an additional sliding leg. Galileo's earliest examples were intended to be used as gunner's levels as well as calculating devices. Bibliography * Galilei, Galileo, Operations of the Geometric and Military Compass, 1606.

Biography  Harvey was born at Summerville near Limerick, Ireland, in 1811, the youngest of 11 children. His father Joseph Massey Harvey, was a Quaker and prominent merchant.http://limerickslife.com/harveys-quay/ William started his education at Ballitore School in County Kildare and by the age of 15 had already established algae as his over-riding interest.Papenfuss, G.F. 1976. pp.21‚Äì46. Landmarks in Pacific North American Marine Phycology. in Abbott, I.A. and Hollenberg, G.J. 1976. Marine Algae of California. Stanford University Press, California. After leaving school he joined the family business. Harvey was an authority on algae and bryophytes (mosses), and author of A Manual of the British Algae (1841), Phycologia Britannica (4 vols., 1846‚Äì51), Nereis Boreali-Americana. (3 parts 1852‚Äì85) and Phycologia Australica (5 vol., 1858‚Äì63).http://users.ugent.be/phycology/harvey He spent several years in South Africa, and was the author, with German botanist Otto Wilhelm Sonder, of the Flora Capensis (7 vol. in 11, 1859 ‚Äì 1933). Harvey's main algal herbarium is located at Trinity College, Dublin. Harvey's discovery in 1831 of the moss Hookeria laetevirens at Killarney, new to Ireland, led to a lifelong friendship with Sir William Jackson Hooker, who was then Regius Professor of Botany at Glasgow University. Hooker recognised the talent of the young man and lent him books and specimens. Soon afterwards Hooker invited him to contribute the section on algae to his British Flora (1833) as well as the section on algae for The Botany of Captain Beechy's Voyage. left In 1835 Harvey went to South Africa aboard the vessel \\"Carnatic\\", with his brother Joseph who had been mistakenly nominated as Colonial Treasurer by Thomas Spring Rice instead of William. When Joseph's health failed in the following year, William took over his duties. They left for Britain together on 14 April 1836 and Joseph died on the voyage. Back in Cape Town, and now officially Treasurer-General, William took up residence at Bishop's Court, rising before dawn every day, collecting in the mountains or sea-shore, and working on the plants at night. In March 1837 he wrote: 'I have taken so many excursions lately that I almost fear I shall earn the sobriquet of Her Majesty's pleasurer general'. In the same year he enlisted the services of botanical collector Karl Zeyher, who was in Uitenhage, to collect specimens. He developed a close friendship with Baron von Ludwig who had started his famous gardens in Cape Town, and dedicated his Genera of South African Plants to him. Under the patronage of Sir George Grey and with the assistance of a team of collectors and of Otto Wilhelm Sonder, he set about writing a Flora Capensis in English ‚Äì he lived long enough to see the first three volumes completed and published in Dublin, the third in 1865. He came home in 1842, having resigned his position due to illness. In 1844 Harvey became curator of the Trinity College Herbarium (TCD)http://www.tcd.ie/Botany/herbarium.html and in 1848 Professor of Botany of the Royal Dublin Society. In 1853 he made a three-year voyage, visiting South Africa, Ceylon, Australia, New Zealand, Tonga, Fiji, and Chile. On his return he published further important books dealing with the botany of North America and South Africa and in 1858 was appointed Professor of Botany at Trinity College, Dublin. He died from tuberculosis on 15 May 1866 at Torquay and was buried there. Botanic Works As a result of the publication of his 1858 book, The genera of South African plants, in which he asked South African readers to send him specimens so that he could begin documenting the flora of the Cape, he began a correspondence with Mary Elizabeth Barber, an amateur naturalist who lived in Cape Colony. Their ongoing correspondence took place during a time when it was not generally accepted for women to engage in scientific discussion; indeed, in the beginning Barber did not disclose the fact that she was a woman. Barber became one of Harvey's main suppliers of plants from South Africa and also assisted him in the naming and classification of numerous species. Over a nearly 30-year correspondence, she sent Harvey approximately 1,000 species with notes on each one. Harvey described over 750 species and in excess of 75 genera of algae.Guiry, M.D., Boalch, G.T. and Peters, A.F. 2010. William Henry Harvey's Grave Rediscovered. The Phycologist. Number 79: 14‚Äì15 His Phycologia Britannica was published in 1846‚Äì1851 and his publication of Nereis Australis Or Algae of the Southern Ocean (1847‚Äì49) along with other publications established his reputation. His Phycologia Australica represents one of the most important books on phycology in the 19th century. Published in five volumes between 1858 and 1863 it is the result of his extensive collecting on the Australian shores. By the time Harvey set foot in Western Australia he had already established himself as a leading phycologist having published several large works. He earned the title: \\"father of Australian Phycology\\". He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1858. Legacy About 600 specimens from Ireland, Ceylon, Friendly Islands, Australia and Tasmania collected by Harvey are in store in the Ulster Museum Herbarium (BEL), almost 90 of which are in the 5th volume of the William Thompson collection in the Ulster Museum, catalogue numbers: F8848‚ÄìF8937. However his primary collection is still in the TCD Herbarium attached to Botany School building of Trinity College. There are also collections of Harvey's specimens in: The former Botany Department of University College, Cork, Ireland; West Chester, Pennsylvania, USA; National Herbarium of Victoria (MEL), Melbourne, Australia; National Herbarium of New South Wales (NSW), Sydney, Australia and the Herbarium of St. Andrews University (STA). In Harvey's era naturalists often relied upon the exchanging of specimens with other scientists and contributions by amateur collectors. His 1841 Manual of the British Algae was dedicated to British beachcomber, Amelia Griffiths. In his Phycologia Britannica Harvey often notes the \\"distribution\\" of each species giving the name of the collector who reported the record. In the Preface of Vol. 1 he lists 19 people to whom he is indebted. These include: Rev Pollexfen and Dr McBain for Orkney algae. The others are: Rev Hore, Dr Cocks, Mr Rohloff, Mr Boswarva, Miss White, Miss Magdalene Turner, Miss Warren, Miss (Anne) Ball, Miss (Isabella) Gifford(4), Miss Cutler (1), Mrs Gatty, Mrs Gulson (?‚Äì1871)(5), Mrs Hayden, Rev Dr Landsborough, Dr Dickie (2), Mr Ralfs and Mr Cresswell. Others noted in volume 1 include: Mr Winch, Mr McCalla (c.1814‚Äì1849)(3), Mr Wigg, Mr Borrer, Miss Hutchins, Mr John Templeton, Mr T.N.Cole, Rev Clouston, Rev H. Davies, Mr Stackhouse, Mrs Ovens, Mr W. Backhouse, DR James Dr. P. Neill and others. Harvey recognised Turner's help and named Cladophora magdalenae Harv. in her honour. Harvey also honoured Susan Fereday's contribution to his work by naming the species Dasya feredayae and Nemastoma feredayae after her. This botanist is denoted by the author abbreviation Harv. when citing a botanical name.

The mountains are located between the cities of Asheboro and Lexington and are bisected by US Highway 64. The mountains are known for their rugged and steep terrain and rise to over 1,000 feet. Typically the Caraways are said to be a part of the Uwharrie Mountains and make up the northern extent of this range. They extend from roughly south of High Point, NC and transition into the Uwharries, stretching roughly 30 miles. The range is only about 10 miles wide. The range takes its name from Caraway Creek, which was named after a Native American tribe that lived in the area before European settlement. The area was once a highly used Indian trading area and many early settlers noted that the Indian trading paths tended to \\"disappear\\" into the mountains. Prominent peaks in the area are Caraway Mountain, Back Creek Mountain, Daves Mountain, Ridges Mountain, and Mount Shepherd, the latter at 1,150 feet being the highest point in Randolph County.

After its postwar reconstruction, it has become a local agriculture hub, as well as a tourist destination.  History  The town was founded some time in the 14th century in dense forests covering the area back then. The first mention dates back to August 14, 1358, when a chronicler noted GoniƒÖdz as a seat of a powiat within the land of Wizna. On December 2, 1382, the dukes of Mazovia (Siemowit IV and his brother and co-regent Janusz I) awarded the Wizna castle, together with the surrounding land, to the Teutonic Order. The land was bought back from the Teutons in 1402, but at the same time the order sold it to the Duke of Lithuania. Because of that, the town was disputed by both the Kingdom of Poland, Duchy of Mazovia and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, with the latter state briefly gaining the upper hand. Eventually the series of Polish-Lithuanian Unions resulted with the town being somewhat of a borderland: owned by noble houses from both sides of the border, with laws of both states applied. In 1430 the duke of Lithuania Vytautas founded a church there. Other owners of the town also expanded the small castle, the most notable of them being Prince Micha≈Ç Gli≈Ñski, Miko≈Çaj II Radziwi≈Ç≈Ç and Sigismund II Augustus, the future king of Poland. In 1547 GoniƒÖdz was granted with a city charter that was modeled on Che≈Çm law. Four years later, King Sigismund Augustus decided that only Polish law be applied for the land surrounding GoniƒÖdz and finally in 1569 the town was annexed by Poland and remained within its borders until today. In 1572 GoniƒÖdz became part of the starostship of Knyszyn; the following year the Sejm, or the Polish parliament, confirmed the city charter. The town continued to grow rapidly and in 1579 was granted with the right to trade with salt, one of the most expensive minerals back then. On May 28, 1621 a huge fire destroyed the town, but it was quickly rebuilt and by 1667 became a seat of local administration. By 1765 the town had 243 houses and roughly 1500 inhabitants, mostly Poles, but also Jews and Tatars. In 1775 a new church was erected by bishop of Przemy≈õl Antoni Beta≈Ñski. = World War II = The Germans occupied the town for 10 Days in September 1939 and burnt the synagogue prior to handing the town over to Soviet forces. The town was reoccupied by the Germans on 26 June 1941 and after consulting with the local priest they appointed a collaborationist town council led by Jan Balonowski.The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945, Geoffrey P. Megargee, Martin C. Dean, and Mel Hecker, Volume II, part A, page 885-886. On 29 June 1941 Polish policemen tortured some 30 Jews, identified as communists. On 2 July 1941 after a few Jews were found hiding in surrounding villages, the town council ordered that \\"All Jews present in nearby villages are ordered to return to town. Any farmers caught harboring a Jew will be shot alongside the Jew\\". On 4 July, an SS unit arrived in the town, assembled the Jews and humiliated them, and prior to leaving gave the Polish authorities a free hand in regards to alleged communists. Some prisoners were released in exchange for payment, but others were tortured or beaten to death. Survivor estimates vary between 20 and 180 dead alleged communists (mainly Jews, some Poles). On 6 July 1941, five Jewish youths were killed by German soldiers after they were caught by the Polish police outside of town. On 20‚Äì21 July 1941, Polish policeman, probably overseen by a small SS unit, instigated a pogrom in which 20 Jews were killed. Following the pogrom, and threatened with further violence, Jewish women conscripted for labor at the German military command at Osowiec, appealed for help from the local German colonel. The colonel dispatched a German military police unit which arrested and then executed six of the perpetrators for stealing Jewish property. There were a number of attempts by Polish and subsequently German authorities to set up a closed ghetto, however after being bribed this was not carried out. 14 Jews were executed by the SS in August 1941 after being rounded up by Polish police as suspected communists. Jews were used for forced labor in a number of Wehrmacht enterprises. On 2 November 1942 the SS drove out most of the Jewish inhabitants to a transit camp in the village of Bogusze. From there they were sent to Treblinka extermination camp and Auschwitz concentration camp and most of them were murdered on arrival, 10 GoniƒÖdz Jews survived in the extermination camps. Another 10 survived hiding near Goniadz. In May 1944 the Germans arrested and shot dead 3 Jews and the Polish couple that was sheltering them. In 1949 some 10 Polish collaborators were tried together for the murder of 25 Jews on 7 July 1941; one received a life sentence and another a six-year term. In 1950 an additional Polish collaborator received a six-year sentence for a different incident.

He taught art history in a number of universities in England and the United States, including Harvard and the University of California, Berkeley. Clark has been influential in developing the field of art history, examining modern paintings as an articulation of the social and political conditions of modern life. His orientation is distinctly leftist, and he has often referred to himself as a Marxist. Life and work University of California, Berkeley, where Clark was a professor until his retirement in 2010 Clark attended Bristol Grammar School. He completed his undergraduate studies at St John's College, Cambridge, he obtained a first- class honours degree in 1964. He received his PhD in art history from the Courtauld Institute of Art, University of London in 1973. He lectured at the University of Essex 1967‚Äì69 and then at Camberwell College of Arts as a senior lecturer, 1970‚Äì74. During this time he was also a member of the British Section of the Situationist International, from which he was expelled along with the other members of the English section. He was also involved in the group King Mob. In 1973 he published two books based on his PhD dissertation: The Absolute Bourgeois: Artists and Politics in France, 1848‚Äì1851 and Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the Second French Republic, 1848‚Äì1851. He taught at the University of California, Los Angeles in 1974‚Äì76. In 1976, he became a founding member of the Caucus for Marxism and Art of the College Art Association. Clark returned to Britain in 1976 when he was appointed professor and head of the Department of Fine Art at the University of Leeds. In 1980 Clark joined the Department of Fine Arts at Harvard University, which angered some of the more conservative, connoisseurship-oriented faculty members, especially the Renaissance art historian Sydney Freedberg, with whom he had a public feud. In 1982 he published an essay, \\"Clement Greenberg's Theory of Art\\", critical of prevailing Modernist theory, which prompted a notable and pointed exchange with Michael Fried. This exchange contributed to the debate between formalist and social histories of art. Clark's works have taken art history in a new direction, away from traditional preoccupations with style and iconography. His books regard modern paintings as expressions of sociopolitical conditions in modern life. In 1988 he joined the faculty at the University of California, Berkeley, where he held the George C. and Helen N. Pardee Chair as Professor of Modern Art until his retirement. In 1991 Clark was awarded the College Art Association's Distinguished Teaching of Art History Award. Notable students include Thomas E. Crow, Michael Kimmelman, John O'Brian and Jonathan Weinberg. As a member of Retort, a Bay Area-based collective of radical intellectuals, he co-authored the book Afflicted Powers: Capital and Spectacle in a New Age of War, published by Verso Books in 2005. In 2005 Clark received a Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award. In 2006 he received an honorary degree from the Courtauld Institute of Art. He and his wife Anne Wagner, who also taught art history at Berkeley, retired in 2010 and moved to London. He continues to be active as a guest lecturer, author, and now as a poet. His book Picasso and Truth: From Cubism to Guernica is based on his Mellon Lectures in Fine Art delivered in spring 2009. Publications * Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution.

It was the first peaceful transfer of power in the history of the Comoros. Personal life Sambi was born in Mutsamudu, on the island of Anjouan. He is a father of seven children including two named Intisware and Fatoumat. He owns factories which produce mattresses, bottled water and perfume - a key Comorian export. He lives above a shop called The House of Mattresses in Mutsamudu, the capital of Anjouan. He also set up a television station called Ulezi (education). He is of Hadhrami ancestry, descending from the Ba 'Alawi family of Hadhramaut (now part of Yemen). Therefore, he is a descendant of Ali al-Uraidhi ibn Ja'far al-Sadiq and hence a Sayyid. =\\"The Ayatollah of Comoros\\"= He was educated in Islamic studies in Sudan, Saudi Arabia and Qom, Iran. According to the Tehran-based Tabnak news agency, while Sambi was there he studied under Ayatollah Mesbah Yazdi.

In the 14 May election, Sambi was declared the victor on 15 May by Secretary of State for elections Ali Abdallah over retired French air force officer Mohamed Djaanfari and long-time politician Ibrahim Halidi, whose candidacy was backed by Azali Assoumani, the outgoing president. Corruption charges In 2018 Sambi was charged with stealing money in a $200 million dollar deal with the UAE government, in which the Comoros passports were provided to Bidoon (stateless) families residing in UAE. Political views Sambi has been quoted as saying that Comoros is not ready to become an Islamic state, nor will anyone be forced to wear a veil under his presidency.

The deck of the pier is above sea level, while the top of the restaurant structure at the end of the pier is Measured via Google Earth's elevation profile feature. The Huntington Beach Pier is on the California Register of Historical Resources. It is one of 123 historic places and districts listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, California (Ref. No. 89001203).National Register of Historic Places in Orange County, California One of the main landmarks of Huntington Beach, also known as \\"Surf City, USA\\", the pier is the center of the city's prominent beach culture. A popular meeting place for surfers, the ocean waves here are enhanced by a natural effect caused by the edge-diffraction of open ocean swells around Catalina Island, creating consistent surf year-round. History The Pier from a boat The Pier from the air The pier was built circa 1902, before the incorporation of Huntington Beach in 1909. The Huntington Beach Company (Standard Oil), built a wooden pier at the terminus of Main Street in 1904\\"A Historical and Geographical Survey of the Huntington Beach Municipal Pier and the Surrounding Beach\\", City of Huntington Beach Public Library, 1975, which extended into the Paciic Ocean. In 1910, it was damaged by a severe storm that caused a large portion of it to plunge into the Pacific. The Huntington Beach Township's board of trustees approved a $70,000 bond in 1911 to construct a new pier made of concrete extending in length. The newly constructed pier was re-dedicated in 1914\\"Finest Concrete Pier on the Coast will be Dedicated Here June 21-21\\", Huntington Beach News, May 22, 1914 and set a record at that time as the longest and highest concrete pleasure pier in the United States.\\"This City has One of the Finest Concrete Piers in the World\\", Huntington Beach News, June 12, 1914 Legendary surfer George Freeth provided a surfing demonstration at the pier re-dedication. In 1931, the city extended the pier by and added the Sunshine Cafe at the end.Jepson, Chris (21 May 2011). \\"The End\\", O.C. History Roundup The extension separated from the original pier during the 1933 Long Beach earthquake. Repairs were made by the City of Huntington Beach, but the pier was damaged again by hurricane weather in 1939. Reconstruction of the pier was completed a year later. After the attack by Japan at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on December 7, 1941, Huntington Beach, along with many other coastal cities, mobilized to help the war effort. The U.S. Navy installed a submarine lookout post on the pier, along with a heavy caliber machine gun. When the war was over, all military equipment was removed and the pier was returned for public use. In 1983 and 1988, Pacific storms destroyed the pier and the \\"End Cafe\\".Jepsen, Chris (21 May 2011). \\"The End\\", O.C. History Roundup Fluor/Daniel Consultants of Irvine conducted a study on the structural stability of the pier and the pier was declared unsafe. It was closed in July of that year. A community group called P.I.E.R. (Persons Interested in Expediting Reconstruction) was organized to raise funds for the pier's reconstruction. P.I.E.R. raised over $100,000 by selling T-shirts and other merchandise with the P.I.E.R. logo. An additional $92,000 was donated by the community of Anjo, Japan, a Huntington Beach Sister City. Construction of a new 1,856-foot pier began in October, 1990. The pier was completed and re-dedicated on July 18, 1992, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony. Over 500,000 people attended the re-dedication and grand re-opening. The City of Huntington Beach established a management and observation program to maintain the pier, an iconic feature for the community. The pier was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) on August 24, 1989, deeming the structure worthy of preservation by the federal government. The pier was reconstructed once more, removing some of the architectural features in 1992, including Neptune's Locker and a bait shop\\"Queen of the Huntington Beach Pier\\", Los Angeles Times, September 13, 1982.  Engineering  The pier at sunset The design of the present-day pier replicates the architectural form of the 1914 design. The concrete pier incorporates reinforced steel, coated with epoxy, to protect it from the corrosive effect of the damp salt air. It is also built to withstand waves or a 7.0 magnitude earthquake and uses an increased space between piles to accommodate surfers - as requested by the City. The pier slopes gently up toward the seaward end in a straight line which alternates with three octagonal platforms and one rotated square (108 feet on a side) that forms a diamond at the pier's seaward end. Not only is the pier structurally sound, it also retains a number of design elements from the original pier including haunches at the pile caps and corbels supporting light standards. Uses and features Ruby's Diner Huntington Beach at sunset The pier is frequented by sport fishermen as well as surfing spectators. Ruby's Diner established at the end of the pier in 1993. Strolling the pier is a popular pastime for both local residents and visitors. The pier has a midnight curfew, two hours after the beach closes to the public. During curfew, there are public safety patrols on the beach and at the pier. Prohibited on the pier are riding bikes and skateboards, smoking, and possession and/or consumption of drugs or alcohol. The City of Huntington Beach operates a 24-hour webcam with a view on the pier, looking west. The City of Huntington Beach beach headquarters provides beach conditions and surf reports are updated throughout the day on the City of Huntington Beach website and at an automated phone line (714-536-9303). The reports include surf, water, wind, and tide information such as surf height, water temperature, and wind speed, and high and low tide times. Special events The annual U.S. Open of Surfing is held on the south side of the pier every summer, hosted by Vans and formerly sponsored by companies such as Hurley, Nike, Converse, and others. It is the largest surfing competition in the world and typically lasts one week. As part of the event, notable people in the world of surfing are also inducted into the Surfing Walk of Fame and the Surfers' Hall of Fame, both located directly across from the pier on Main Street. The Surfing Walk of Fame incorporates embedded plaques in the Main Street sidewalk; the Surfers' Hall of Fame incorporates the surfer's own hand prints. Sunset on Sunday, 9/7/14 at Huntington Beach Pier The pier also features many other events throughout the year, though most occur in the summer. Many other surfing competitions are held here like the PSA, NASSA, and CSA. Tournaments are also held for other sports such as volleyball, wrestling, BMX, kite flying, paintballing, and fishing. Races and marathons such as the Surf City Marathon & Half Marathon, which is held every Super Bowl Sunday and the Surf City 10, which is in October pass by the pier. The city also hosts an Annual Pier Swim and Rough Water Swim in which participants have to swim around the pier. There are also fireworks and parades to celebrate the Fourth of July.

As of 2007, many American private schools have K‚Äì8 configurations.Radcliffe, Jennifer. \\"HISD transitioning some campuses to K‚Äì8.\\" Houston Chronicle. December 31, 2007. Retrieved on April 9, 2013. History The \\"junior high school\\" concept was introduced in 1909. In the late 19th century and early 20th century most American elementary schools had grades 1 through 8. As time passed, until the 1940s, junior high schools increased quickly.Wiles, p. 3. The installation of junior high schools was made in order to provide more academic and social opportunities for adolescent students prior to entering high school. By the 1960s many U.S. school districts separated the elementary and junior high school levels, with seventh through ninth grade students at junior high school. As years passed, the model changed to middle schools serving grades six through eight. By 2007, in some communities, schools in areas where academic performance at the middle school level was low were converting back to the K‚Äì8 model in an attempt to increase academic performance. By 2008 many urban school systems converted middle schools to K‚Äì8 schools. Districts moving to K‚Äì8 schools included the Baltimore City Public School System, Cincinnati Public Schools, and the School District of Philadelphia.Bloom, Alex. \\"K‚Äì8 or middle school? Which is better?.\\" The Arizona Republic. December 28, 2008. Retrieved on November 24, 2013. Jennifer Radcliffe of the Houston Chronicle said that teachers said that the scenario that \\"students aren't tripped up during the disruptive year that they transition to middle school\\" was \\"[o]ne of the biggest perks\\" of the conversion to K‚Äì8 schools. Radcliffe said that experts told her that \\"By staying on the same campus, kids can focus on academics, rather than being forced to re-establish themselves socially. Teachers are able to establish solid relationships with families. As a result, parents are more apt to stay involved with the campus through the middle school years\\". Radcliffe added that compared to traditional middle schools, a K-8 has a reduced capacity in offering athletics and elective classes.  References  * Wiles, John (editor).

Background Born in Denver, Colorado, Tymkovich is a third-generation Coloradan; his great-grandfather emigrated from Ukraine to the United States via Ellis Island and worked as a miner. Tymkovich received a Bachelor of Arts degree at Colorado College in 1979 and his Juris Doctor at the University of Colorado Law School 1982. He then clerked for Justice William Erickson, Chief Justice of the Colorado Supreme Court, from 1982 to 1983. From 1983 to 1991, Tymkovich worked in private practice in Denver and Washington, D.C. In 1991, Colorado Attorney General Gale Norton appointed him Solicitor General of the State of Colorado. Tymkovich served in that position until 1996, arguing several cases in front of the Supreme Court of the United States. Most notably, in Romer v. Evans (1996), he unsuccessfully argued that Colorado's Amendment 2 (which revoked local legal protections for members of the LGBT community) was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. He then returned to private practice in Denver. Tenth Circuit nomination and confirmation President George W. Bush initially nominated Tymkovich to the seat on the Tenth Circuit on May 25, 2001, and renominated him on January 7, 2003. President Bill Clinton previously had nominated Christine Arguello for the seat, but she never received a hearing or a vote from the United States Senate. Tymkovich was confirmed by the United States Senate in a 58-41 vote on April 1, 2003, and received his commission the same day. He replaced Judge John Carbone Porfilio, who took senior status. He became Chief Judge on October 1, 2015. In September 2016, Tymkovich and his circuit colleague Neil Gorsuch were named as possible U.S. Supreme Court nominees by Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. In 2018 Tymkovich was tasked with reviewing more than a dozen ethics complaints filed against U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. Beginning in 2001, Kavanaugh was involved in a campaign to get Tymkovich appointed as a federal judge. Notable cases United States v. McCane, 573 F.3d 1037 (10th Cir. 2009): Markice McCane was convicted of being a felon in possession of a firearm in violation of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 922(g)(1). On appeal, he contended that the felon-in- possession statute was unconstitutional in light of District of Columbia v. Heller (2008). But the Tenth Circuit affirmed the conviction after noting the statement in Heller that \\"nothing in our opinion should be taken to cast doubt on longstanding prohibitions on the possession of firearms by felons.\\"128 S.Ct. at 2816-17. In a concurring opinion, Judge Tymkovich expressed concern that the statement \\"short-circuits at least some of the analysis and refinement that would otherwise take place in the lower courts,\\" particularly since the statement was based on a possibly questionable premise‚Äîthat the felon-in-possession prohibition was longstanding. Guttman v. Khalsa, 669 F.3d 1101 (10th Cir. 2012): Dr. Stuart Guttman brought suit under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 after the New Mexico Board of Medical Examiners revoked his medical license. In an opinion written by Judge Tymkovich, the Tenth Circuit held that the Eleventh Amendment protected States from lawsuits based on professional licensing decisions. United States v. Strandlof, 667 F.3d 1146 (10th Cir. 2012): Rick Glen Strandlof was convicted of violating the Stolen Valor Act of 2005, 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 704(b), which makes it illegal to falsely claim to have received a military award or honor. In an opinion written by Judge Tymkovich, the Tenth Circuit held that the First Amendment does not protect knowingly false statements of fact. In United States v. Alvarez (2012), a plurality of the Supreme Court held that the Act was unconstitutional, although a majority of justices held that lies about easily verifiable facts (e.g., receiving military honors) are outside the core of First Amendment protection. Hobby Lobby Stores v. Sebelius, 723 F.3d 1114 (10th Cir. 2013): The court found for-profit corporations Hobby Lobby and Mardel Christian Bookstores could assert religious freedom as \\"persons\\" under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.http://www.ca10.uscourts.gov/opinions/12/12-6294.pdf Judge Tymkovich wrote for the five-judge en banc majority, over a three-judge dissent.Recent Cases: Tenth Circuit Holds For-Profit Corporate Plaintiffs Likely to Succeed on the Merits of Substantial Burden on Religious Claim, 127 Harv.

It is the administrative headquarters of Katol taluka, one of the 14 talukas of this district. Being located in orange belt it is a major centre for orange trading. Mythology In Dvapara Yuga, during the reign of Raja Chandrahasa, Katol's name was Kuntalapur. Katol is also mentioned in the Ashwamedh canto of the Mahabharat as Kuntalapur. Katol is the location of two of the Hemadpanthi temples, Maa Chandika and Maa Saraswati, which are said to date from the days of Rawan and to have been built in one night by his demons. The mud fort dates from the time of the Gond dynasty. Geography and climate Katol is located at .Falling Rain Genomics, Inc - Katol It has an average elevation of 417 metres (1368 ft). Katol is approximately 56 km to the west of Nagpur, with which it is connected by a road of fair quality that also passes through the town of Kalmeshwar, 18 km from Nagpur. The town now includes the large adjoining village of Peth Budhwar, which lies on the Jam, a tributary of the Wardha River. The combined population of Katol and Peth Budhwar was 7040 in 1891 and 7313 in 1901, but as the town is the trade centre of a wide cotton-growing tract, it has grown considerably since the last census. The old town-site is crowded, lying in a hollow, but the recent trend of extension has been towards the higher ground on the southeast where the cotton factories stand. Map of Nagpur district with major towns(including Katol) and rivers. Katol has a tropical wet and dry climate (K√∂ppen climate classification) with dry conditions prevailing for most of the year. Demographics As of 2011 Indian Census, Katol had a total population of 43,267, of which 22,064 were males and 21,203 were females. Population within the age group of 0 to 6 years was 4,174. The total number of literates in Katol was 35,231, which constituted 81.4% of the population with male literacy of 83.6% and female literacy of 79.2%. The effective literacy rate of 7+ population of Katol was 90.1%, of which male literacy rate was 92.8% and female literacy rate was 87.4%. The Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes population was 6,086 and 3,425 respectively. Katol had 9866 households in 2011. Administration The Corporation of Katol. The Corporation of Katol was established in 1919. Katol reached the first stage of modern municipal development in 1905 when it was designated as a Town-Fund area. For the first year its income was only Rs. 4761, but it has now risen to about Rs. 7176. Its prosperity depends chiefly on cotton trading, and in recent years most of the municipal income has for that reason been expended on a cotton market. This is a large enclosure of about , securely fenced, and provided with a weighing shed, well, water trough, young shade trees, and an arc light. Economy Indian hybrid Orange The weekly market of Katol has long been important and is now attended by from 6000 to 8000 people. Commodities of all kinds are dealt in but the bazar is more especially important as being the second largest cattle - market in the town. In the month of Ashvin (October) the Saraswati fair (Navaratra) is held and is usually attended by about 20,000 people a day. The orchards of the town are, noted for their growth of fine & world-famous oranges. Cotton ready for harvest But cotton is the staple of Katol trade. In the year 1905-06 26,723 carts of raw uncleaned cotton were sold in the market, and that number is liable to be exceeded in years of heavy harvest, for the town draws produce from the rich valleys of the Jam and Wardha rivers and from many villages of the Amravati and Wardha Districts. There are now four ginning factories at work, and three of these have presses also. They are fitted with 216 gins, which in 1905-06 turned out 32,000 bales (or 512,000 maunds) of cleaned cotton. The Katol tahsil has a total area of , of which 56 are comprised in Government forest. Katol has, on the whole, the poorest soils of the four tahsils as regards composition, although it has all the kali soils of the first class in the District . The percentages of the various soils are 2 for kali, 55.9 for morand, 28.5 for khardi and 13.2; for bardi. Nevertheless, from an agricultural point of view Katol is the most advanced of the four tahsils, and its lands produce kharif crops as valuable as the wheat of the other tahsils. The cultivators are intelligent and enterprising to an unusual degree and spend much time and money on improvements to their fields. Of the of irrigated garden land at settlement were in Katol. Of the total area of at settlement, 358,000 were occupied and 332,000 were in cultivation. The actual area cropped has risen since the thirty years' settlement from to in 1906‚Äì07, an increase of 29 percent, which is the largest in any tahsil. Of the total area 75 percent is occupied, 8.7 is scrub jungle, 4.2 tree-forest, and 11.8 unculturable. Once Katol and Kalmeshwar talukas in Nagpur district had enough groundwater to irrigate their orange orchards, but in the past decade or so, the water table has gone down to 700‚Äì900 feet in almost the entire belt and digging of bore wells has become uneconomical. Farmers here have now switched to conventional dry-land farming of cotton and soybean, with the area under orange cultivation reduced almost to half. Temples Chandika Devi Mandir ‚Äì The temple is believed to have been built during the reign of one king Chandrahasa, who is supposed to have ruled over this territory in the dim and distant past. The construction of the temple is. in the Hemadpanthi style. It is situated in the old Basti. The 'Gabhara', which contains the idol of the goddess, measures 9.290 m.2 (10' x 10'). It is beautifully carved out of black rock and is in a standing position. On either side of the entrance to the 'Gabhara' are two images in standing posture which appear to be the bodyguards of the goddess Chandika. Outside is the ' Sabhamandap' having windows on all the four sides which serve as inlets for the sunlight. In the center exactly facing the goddess is a 'Honikunda' housed by a little dome. On the 'Mandap' wall, to the left of the goddess, is engraved the image of Lord Gajanan with exquisite skill. Against the outer side of the Mandap-walls are carved the images of animals, wild as well as domestic, and numerous deities which add a tinge of glory and glamor to the solid and grave structure of the building. The architectural designs speak eloquently of the architects of those times. In Navratra , Shardotsava is celebrated with great √©clat when thousands of people gather to pay homage to the goddess. Sharada Mandir‚Äî The idol is supposed to be ' Svayambhu'. It is a small building housing two images of the same goddess of unequal size. The images depict a sort of crude and rough architecture. In front of the temple is a tank of water of the size of a square measuring 37.161 m.2 (20' x 20'), whose water, it is said, never dries up. The place is venerated by the Hindus as a ' Tirtha Ksetra'. By the side of the tank is another small temple which houses the images of Maruti, Ganapati and Shivling. To the left of the Sharada Mandir is housed yet another Shivling by the side of which are three small samadhis of unknown persons. Two fairs, one on the occasion of Shardotsava and the other on Chaitra Shuddha 15th, are held when devotees of the goddess gather in large numbers. Shiv Mandir ‚Äì The Mandir is situated on the southern bank of a beautiful tank, now let on lease to the Government for pisciculture, with a lovely hillock at the hack and a giant Pimpal tree in the front. The inner shrine or 'Gabhara' of the temple is 5.945 m.2 (8' x 8') with Ling occupying the central position. The Ling is donned with a brass plaque. On the wall facing the visitor are engraved the images of innumerable deities in beautiful and attractive designs. Outside is the 'Mandap' of the temple enclosed on all the four sides with walls having a single entrance in the front. It is used to deliver Kirtans and hold religious discourses in praise of the God. To the south of the temple of Shiv there is a temple of Maruti whose image is about 3 meters (10 ft) tall. The idol of Maruti has become the major attraction to the people. The Pimpal tree protects under its shade one more Shivling and an image of Nandi both carved out of black stone. The natural surroundings like the tank, the hillock and the Pimpal (tree provide an excellent setting and add charm and beauty to the temple. Especially the evenings, at the time of sunset, are lively and pleasant. It has become a good spot of recreation. Education Banarasidas Ruiya High School and Junior College, Katol.

Reviews of the book fault the selection of data used, the methodology, and the conclusions drawn from the data, resulting in criticism that it is \\"the sort of book that gives IQ testing a bad name.\\" Summary As with Lynn's and Tatu Vanhanen's 2006 book IQ and Global Inequality, the book was published by Washington Summit Publishers.Washington Summit Publishers It was followed in 2008 by The Global Bell Curve. Lynn's survey is an expansion by nearly four times of the data collected in his 2002 book IQ and the Wealth of Nations with Tatu Vanhanen, which dealt with the relationship between IQ and economic development. The book claims to represent the largest collection and review of the global Intelligence Quotient (IQ) data, surveying 620 published studies from around the world, with a total of 813,778 tested individuals. Lynn defines races as the genetic clusters or ancestral population groups identified in previous genetic cluster analysis by Luigi Cavalli-Sforza and his colleagues in their 1994 book The History and Geography of Human Genes. Many current ethnic groups would be mixtures of these races. Reception Psychology professor J. Philippe Rushton, who argued for many of the same conclusions as Lynn and served with Lynn on the board of the Pioneer Fund, wrote a favorable review and called it Lynn's \\"crowning achievement\\". In a 2008 review of the data used in Lynn's book, Hunt and Wittmann write: > \\"The majority of the data points were based upon convenience rather than > representative samples. Some points were not even based on residents of the > country. For instance, the ‚Äúdata point‚Äù for Suriname was based on tests > given to Surinamese who had migrated to the Netherlands, and the ‚Äúdata > point‚Äù for Ethiopia was based on the IQ scores of a highly selected group > that had emigrated to Israel and, for cultural and historical reasons, was > hardly representative of the Ethiopian population. The data point for Mexico > was based upon a weighted averaging of the results of a study of ‚ÄúNative > American and Mestizo children in southern Mexico‚Äù with result of a study of > residents of Argentina. Upon reading the original reference, we found that > the ‚Äúdata point‚Äù that Lynn and Vanhanen used for the lowest IQ estimate, > Equatorial Guinea, was actually the mean IQ of a group of Spanish children > in a home for the developmentally disabled in Spain. Corrections were > applied to adjust for differences in IQ across cohorts (the ‚ÄúFlynn‚Äù effect), > on the assumption that the same correction could be applied internationally, > without regard to the cultural or economic development level of the country > involved. While there appears to be rather little evidence on cohort effect > upon IQ across the developing countries, one study in Kenya (Daley, Whaley, > Sigman, Espinosa, & Neumann, 2003)Daley et al., 2003 T.

Neumann, IQ on the rise: The Flynn effect > in rural Kenyan children, Psychological Science 14 (5) (2003), pp. 215‚Äì219. > shows a substantially larger cohort effect than is reported for developed > countries.\\" A review by Nicholas Mackintosh, Emeritus Professor in the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Cambridge, expresses astonishment that Lynn infers that Kalahari bushmen, with an average measured IQ of 54, should be regarded as mentally retarded; and that an 8-year-old European child with the equivalent mental age would have no problems surviving in the same desert environment. Mackintosh questions Lynn's hypothesis that migration to more harsh northern climates and ice ages selected for higher IQ by pointing to harshness of environments such as the Australian Outback. Lynn argues that racial differences in brain size indicates different evolutionary pressure on intelligence. Mackintosh argues that the cranial capacity of early Homo sapiens, 100,000 or more years ago, was rather greater than that of modern Europeans. He criticizes Lynn for reporting data incorrectly, in some cases from studies by Mackintosh himself. He writes: \\"The errors may not be particularly important, and I do not know how typical they are. But they do not increase my confidence in Lynn's scholarship.\\" He also writes: > A more egregious example is provided by his treatment of the Eyferth (1961) > study of two groups of illegitimate children fathered by (mostly) American > black and white servicemen and brought up by their (carefully matched) > German mothers. Eyferth reported an average IQ of 96.5 for the mixed race > children and of 97.2 for the whites. Lynn reduces the former number to 94 to > compensate for use of an old test, and compares it, not with the score of > the white sample, but with an average IQ of 100 for German children. He is > thus able to conclude that the IQ of these mixed race children is half way > between that of Americans and Africans.

Loehlin, University of Texas Professor emeritus, argues that the general trends in the data that Lynn presents are probably dependable, but faults Lynn for carelessness in how his conclusions are presented. Loehlin summarizes his view of the book as follows: > Is this book the final word on race differences in intelligence? Of course > not. But Richard Lynn is a major player, and it is good to have his > extensive work on this topic together in one place. Future workers who > address these matters under this or any other label will find that Lynn has > done a lot of spadework for them.

It is a unique hydro-engineering system for flood control and hydrotechnical management, amelioration, forestry, water supply, waste water evacuation, navigation, tourism, fishing, hunting. Name It was named after the two large rivers which it connects ‚Äì the Danube and the Tisa. There are several other names used for the canal in other languages: ; , etc. Geography It covers the northern part of Serbia ‚Äì the territory of Vojvodina (Baƒçka and Banat regions), with the total area of about 12,700 km¬≤. It consists of a number of canals, including: *Great Baƒçka Canal *Little Baƒçka Canal Characteristics The total length of the dug main canals is 929 km, including new and old canals and streams which were completely or partially reconstructed and thus included in the new system. In the basic canal network there are 51 structures ‚Äì 24 gates, 16 locks, five safety gates, six pumping stations, and 180 bridges. There are 14 cargo ports on the canals. On the new canals of the Danube-Tisa-Danube water system, 84 bridges were built ‚Äì 62 carriageway, 19 railway and 3 pedestrian bridges. One of the most important structures within this water system is the dam on the river Tisa near Novi Beƒçej which regulates the water regime in the basic canal network in Banat, for irrigation of about 3,000 km¬≤.  History  Historically the channel is called Franz Channel, after emperor Franz II. He was the Emperor of Austria as its construction started in the time when Hungary was part of the Habsburg Monarchy. Even the emperor visited the construction site. The smaller channel that starts from Stapar and goes to Novi Beƒçej was called Franz Joseph Channel. The dam is based on the plans of Albert Hainz, who was the technical director of the channel. The dam was constructed between 1895 and 1899. Istv√°n T√ºrr participated in the compilation and implementation of the plans. The dam locks are powered by electricity. The electrical power required for operation is provided by the lock-built hydroelectric power generator. According to the official records, delegations arrived from as far as Japan for the inauguration ceremony. At the time of its construction, it was one of the most sophisticated dam-locks in the world.

East Blatchington is associated with Tide Mills, and is sometimes given as an alternate name for the Tide Mills area. History The area was settled by the Romans, who probably used it as a port to transfer goods to mainland Europe. The area was taken over by the Saxons after the Romans had left it. The village originally ran from the church to the duck pond. Like Seaford and Newhaven, its western neighbour, East Blatchington was a front line coastal defence during the Napoleonic war, and had a military barracks built in 1794 and demolished after the Great War. In its early years, it was badly supplied, which resulted in 500 men mutinying and occupying Seaford. The townspeople gave them provisions and alcohol. The following day, the regular army, based at Newhaven overpowered them and arrested twenty mutineers. The leaders were executed and the others punished. The barracks were lightly manned, until the First World War and became a staging post for soldiers fighting in France, who were shipped from Newhaven. After the war, the barracks were demolished. St Peter's Parish Church dates back to about 1100 and the church registers date from 1563. The church has a memorial to pioneer balloonist Henry Tracey Coxwell. Blatchington Pond was restored in 1980 and remains largely the same to this present day. There is a connection with Jimi Hendrix and his estranged fianc√© Monika Dannemann through her book 'The Inner World of Jimi Hendrix (1995)' and a legal dispute with Kathy Etchingham sadly leading to Monika's alleged suicide at 50 Belgrave Road, East Sussex on 1 May 1996. Sport The area has a seven court tennis club, called Seaford Lawn Tennis Club. It is also nearby to one of the oldest golf clubs in Sussex, Seaford Golf Club.
