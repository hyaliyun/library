He is credited with building the organization and is one of the founders of the modern German Intelligence Community, as well as one of the first general officers of the Bundeswehr. He became a professional soldier in the Weimar Republic in 1924 and started his career in intelligence in the Foreign Armies East unit that analysed the Soviet Union during WWII; before his 1955 appointment as Director of MAD he worked for the CIA during the early 1950s. He is the father of Gerhard Selmayr and the grandfather of the Secretary-General of the European Commission, Martin Selmayr. Early career and WWII Selmayr was born to a Catholic family from Bavaria, as the son of the pharmacist Josef Selmayr (1877–1927) and Josefine née Betz (1879–1938). His grandfather Georg Selmayr (1852–1920) was the brother of the last mayor of Bogenhausen, now a district of Munich, also named Josef Selmayr. He became a professional soldier in 1924 during the Weimar Republic and served in a number of administrative posts in the interwar period and the Second World War. He became a captain in the late 1930s and a major around 1942, and was promoted to colonel near the end of the war. He eventually served as a staff officer on the general staff of Army Group F in the Balkans and in the Foreign Armies East military intelligence organization, which focused on analyzing the Soviet Union and other East European states. He received the German Cross in Gold and the Iron Cross First Class and Second Class. At the end of the war he initially became an American prisoner of war, but was later transferred to British control. He was never a member of any political party; political activities were forbidden for members of the military, a policy dating back to the establishment of the Weimar Republic and that was enforced until 1944.Josef Selmayr (author), Gerhard Selmayr (editor.): Ein Sandkorn im Sturm: Aufzeichnungen eines Soldaten 1905–1945, 2016, Imprisonment in Communist Yugoslavia In 1946, he was delivered as prisoner of war from the British army to the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, at the time a one-party state allied with Stalin.John B. Allcock, Explaining Yugoslavia, C Hurst & Co Publishers, 2000, page 271 In late 1948 he was sentenced by the Yugoslav communist regime to 15 years in jail, but was released about a year later in 1950. Selmayr recounted his experiences in Tito's Yugoslavia in the book Die grosse Pause: Deutsche Soldaten in Titos Gewalt; according to the book he and his fellow soldiers were essentially hostages of the Yugoslav communist regime and he described the trials that took place there as political show trials based on political charges produced by the country's communist regime and unrecognised under international law; he and the other soldiers were released following the Tito–Stalin Split and the realignment of Yugoslav foreign policy that resulted in better relations with West Germany, after Chancellor Konrad Adenauer had negotiated with the Yugoslav government for the repatriation of the remaining German prisoners of war.Josef Selmayr (author), Gerhard Selmayr (editor): Die grosse Pause: Deutsche Soldaten in Titos Gewalt, 2014, Work for the CIA In 1950 he made it back to West Germany, and in 1951 he was employed by the Gehlen Organization, a CIA-affiliated intelligence agency focused on the East European communist regimes, especially the Soviet Union. He served with the CIA as an expert on the Eastern European communist regimes. The Gehlen Organization was transferred from the CIA to the West German government and became the Federal Intelligence Service a year after Selmayr left the organization. Director of the Military Counterintelligence Service In 1955 he was promoted to Brigadier General in the West German Bundeswehr and appointed as the first Director of the Military Counterintelligence Service, serving in the position for nine years until 1964. He is credited with building the organization.Dieter Krüger (ed.): Konspiration als Beruf. Deutsche Geheimdienstchefs im Kalten Krieg. Links, Berlin 2003, , S. 312. He thus became one of the first general officers of the Bundeswehr, one of the founders of the modern German military and one of the founders of the modern German Intelligence Community. Josef Selmayr has been described as a close associate of Reinhard Gehlen; in the early days of the Cold War Gehlen succeeded in gaining a monopoly for himself in the West German intelligence community, and he succeeded in getting his confidant Selmayr appointed as Director of the Military Counterintelligence Service, which was formally part of the military and separate from the Federal Intelligence Service, where Gehlen was President.Matthew M. Aid, Cees Wiebes, Secrets of Signals Intelligence During the Cold War and Beyond, p. 166, Psychology Press, 2001 Retirement and final years At the end of his career, Selmayr became known for contesting his retirement with legal means. The normal retirement age for senior military officers was 60 years, but the Ministry of Defence at the time sought to retire senior officers even before they reached 60 to make room for younger talent, and accordingly it was decided that Selmayr had to retire in 1964, the year he turned 59. Selmayr contested this decision in the Federal Administrative Court, but lost.Sperre geknackt, Der Spiegel He died in 2005 at the age of 100, 41 years after he retired. He wrote a memoir about his own experiences as a soldier and a book about his experiences in Tito's Yugoslavia, which were published after his death by his son Gerhard Selmayr. He also wrote a book about his family.

During the Second World War, Slavik worked as a cryptographer and translator on the Japanese desk of the Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht. He continued to work in his old age, and was recently working on collecting material for a work on the Susanoo-no- Mikoto and the cultural history of the Izumo area in ancient Japan (History of Japan) He was a pioneer of Japanology and Japanese ethnological studies in Vienna. Life Alexander Slawik was the son of an Imperial and Royal (German:kaiserlich und königlich) (Abbr. KuK) officer family who was part of the Austria-Hungary Monarchy and grew up in Kraków, where his father was commander of the city. Slawik became interested in the Japan and the Japanese language, in discussion with his father, who was interested in the Russo- Japanese War and who made significant contributions to the corpus. During his time, his father purchased a course in Chinese grammar, which was bought in Vienna. He then undertook a study of a Japanese course, and while he was in pupil in Secondary school, undertook extensive study of Kojiki and Nihon Shoki at Krems an der Donau. As an 18-year-old, he found himself destitute and penniless in Vienna after the end of the war in 1918 and a failed apprenticeship as a metalworker. He then began to study law in order to make a living, but when he failed his staatsexamen, (state exams) he was only too happy to give up this career in favour of East Asian studies. He earned his livelihood at this time as a commercial employee, working as a clerk at Siemens-Schuckert (1924–31). Through his contacts with the small Japanese community in Vienna he remained in contact with the field. Slavik came into contact with the Austrian diplomat, former imperial envoy in Beijing and sinologist Arthur von Rosthorn, who would later become an mentor. Through discussions with Rosthorn, Slawik formulated a dissertation through the study of early contacts between Japan, Korea and China during the Han dynasty. However, Slawik was informed by the deans office that the University of Vienna, where his mentor Rosthorn held an honorary professor, that it was not possible to obtain a doctorate, since at that time the disciplines of sinology and Japanology did not yet exist in Vienna. Through his Vienna circle, he met the poet, neurologist and psychiatrist Mokichi Saitō where the discussed Tanka stories and the ethnologist Masao Oka (岡正雄) who would have a profound effect on Salwik. In 1931, he returned to study with a focus on Japanese ethnogenesis, where he was promoted to Dr. Phil with a thesis called: Cultural strata in Old Korea (German:Kulturschichten in Alt-Korea) Career A planned appointment to the Fujian University of the SVD Order, which later became the Fujian Normal University in Beijing was prevented by the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in East Asia. He then taught as a lecturer for Japanese language at the Consular Academy in Vienna, later also at the University of Vienna. At that time he was already engaged in the underground for the Nazi Party, which would later lead to his dismissal from the state service in 1945. Together with Professor Oka, he established research at the Japan Institute. This institute was donated by Baron Mitsui Takaharu (高原 高原) in 1937/38. In 1939, he was conscripted. Through his efforts to preserve the Japan Institute and particularly its library, he gained the trust of the anthropologist, Professor Wilhelm Koppers, who was director of the Institute of Ethnology at the University of Vienna. Starting from 1948 he was appointed as an assistant Professor, then assistant to Koppers, particularly with the establishment of the library at the university. He later became the head of a Japan department. From 1964 he was promoted to Professor extraordinarius, within the Institute of Ethnology, which was transferred to an independent institute for Japanese studies in 1965. He was the director until his retirement in 1971. For the first time, he visited Japan, with the support of UNESCO (Paris) during 1957-58. During the stay, he undertook field studies at the Ainu and in Kyushu villages (Kyushu). The collected Ainu of the Saru Valley cult objects are an important part of the collection of the Museum of Ethnology, Vienna. At the invitation of the Japanese Foreign Ministry in 1966, he researched in the Fukuoka area. During 1968-69, further work on Hokkaido and Kyushu laid the cornerstone of the interdisciplinary project, developed and managed by him, whose aim was the comprehensive recording of the culture of a historically comprehensible space. The result of this long-standing project, a documentation on the topography, social and economic history, the rural equipment inventory as well as the situation of the Burakumin in the Aso basin (Asō Bay), is available in three volumes. Among the pupils of Slawik, who themselves made a name for themselves for Japanese studies of the \\"Wiener Schule\\", were Josef Kreiner, Peter Pantzer and Sepp Linhart. Slawik spent his life in a Viennese retirement home. He was buried at the Vienna Central Cemetery. War work During the Second World War, Dr Slawik, along with Dr Wolfgang Schmal, ran the Japanese desk of the language department of Cipher Department of the High Command of the Wehrmacht as he was the most experienced individual with Second Lieutenant () Dr Walter Adler in command.

After graduating from the Art College in 1939, Boris Nesterenko entered the Leningrad Institute for Painting, Sculpture and Architecture on the recommendation of his teachers, but did not get a chance to study since he was called up for military service in the same year to serve as a tank commander. Subsequently he moved to the BSSR in a paratroop drop where he organized a partisan party and conducted sabotage efforts on the communications of the German fascist invaders. Boris Nesterenko was the commissar of a partisan detachment in Belarus, Baranovichi region.

In his works, Boris Nesterenko combined elements of the traditional soviet, Ukrainian and Belarusian art schools, academic social realism and the so-called “soviet impressionism”. He worked in different genres of the easel painting - including marine and municipal landscapes. He also painted old Kiev. Some of his subjects included scenes of Vydubichi, Kyiv-Pechersk Lavra, also cultural Sedniv, the location of the Art Centre of Ukrainian Artists. Many landscapes of Sedniv are depicted in works of a well- known Ukrainian painter Tetyana Yablonska.

It was a fully-fledged municipality before the 1977 fusion of the Belgian municipalities. The village is a member of the non-profit organization Les Plus Beaux Villages de Wallonie (\\"The Most Beautiful Villages of Wallonia\\").  Geography  The main road N83 between Arlon and Bouillon runs along the west side, above the village. The east side of the village is bordered by the Semois, a tributary of the Meuse. Chassepierre is bounded on the south by the French border.  Name  The name Chassepierre comes from Casa petrea, the Latin for \\"stone house\\". Indeed, the houses of the village are mostly made of stones from the 18th and 19th century.  Architectural heritage  thumb The church of Saint Martin was built in 1702.  Festival  left The village, considered one of the most charming of Belgium, is mainly famous for its international festival of street art, more commonly known as la Fête des Artistes (literally \\"the Artists' Festival\\"). The Chassepierre Festival takes place every year on the second-to-last weekend of August. This festival is the second biggest summer event in Wallonia, after Les Francofolies de Spa, an annual music festival. The festival currently gathers some 50 professional performance companies with different artists such as actors, musicians, dancers, and acrobats from all over the world. More than 30,000 visitors take part in this festival every year. = History = In 1972, some artists, the poet Marie Fizaine and the writer Georges Linze among them, decided to organise La fête des Artistes. In 1973, Alain Schmitz, organiser of social programmes in Florenville, became artistic director of the festival. For its first official edition under the leadership of the village committee, an entire street was dedicated to poets and street artists. A non-profit organisation, La Fête des Artistes de Chassepierre, was then founded to manage the budgets of the festival that were becoming more important. An inhabitant of the village, Marc Poncin, became president of the association and increasingly the festival spread itself to the whole of the village. In 2003, the Festival expanded to meadows situated in the other side of the river Semois. It was then possible to cross the river on a temporary footbridge. Ten years later, in 2013, a permanent bridge was built on the pillars of a former tramway bridge. In 2016, the 43rd edition of the festival took place, gathering more than 50 performance companies from Belgium, but also from The Netherlands, France, Spain, Italy, Austria and Great Britain.

It was originally known from isolated teeth from England, before a more complete jaw with teeth was found in the Kilmaluag Formation of Skye, Scotland. Etymology Wareolestes rex was named by Eric Freeman, who named it for Dr. Martin Ware \\"in recognition of this major contribution\\" to Freeman's successful work. The second part of the generic name, lestes, comes from the Greek for brigand. The species name rex, Latin for king, is both in recognition of the relatively large size of this Mesozoic mammaliaform, and a pun on the name of Mr E. J. King. Discovery Wareolestes rex was first found in and named from the Forest Marble Formation of Kirtlington, Oxfordshire, England. The holotype is a single molar tooth, originally described as a lower molar, but later argued to be an upper molar.Hahn G., Sigogneau-Russell D. and Gogefroit P. 1991. New data on Brachyzostrodon (Mammalia; Upper Triassic). Geologica et Paleontologica, 25, 237-249. Only a few more single teeth were found from the same site in the subsequent years.Butler P. and Sigogneau-Russell D. 2016. Diversity of triconodonts in the Middle Jurassic of Great Britain. Palaeontologia Polonica, 67, 35-65. In 2017 a more complete Wareolestes was recovered from the Isle of Skye in Scotland. This fossil was an almost complete lower jaw, with some permanent adult teeth and several unerupted adult teeth still inside the jaw, as revealed by microCT scanning. This fossil also confirmed the original interpretation of the holotype tooth as being a lower molar. Biology The Scottish fossil Wareolestes, a dentary (lower jaw) had three permanent adult molar teeth, and several unerupted adult premolar teeth still inside the jaw below the gumline. This shows Wareolestes replaced its teeth in the modern mammalian way (diphyodonty), an important step in the evolution of true mammal characteristics. It also suggests that Wareolestes produced milk to feed its young.The Guardian - New fossil mammal was the first ‘King’ of Scotland This is because diphyodonty is associated with replacing smaller 'milk' teeth, present when an animal is young and growing quickly (and being fed on milk), with larger adult teeth that allow it to process adult food and be weaned. The environment in which Wareolestes is found is brackish and lagoonal. These lagoons were populated by crocodiles, turtles, and basal squamates and salamanders. Classification Wareolestes is a mammaliaform, but it was not a true or crown-group mammal. This is because, as a morganucodontid, it probably retained both the mammalian and non mammalian jaw joint, and also retained the postedentary bones. It belongs in the order Morganucodonta, and the family Megazostrodontidae. Mammaliaforms are often referred to as mammals colloquially, even though this is not considered technically correct by palaeontologists. They are also often referred to as stem mammals, or Mesozoic mammals. ;Phylogeny  See also  * Evolution of mammals  References  Category:Jurassic synapsids Category:Transitional fossils Category:Bathonian life Category:Jurassic mammals of Europe Category:Jurassic England Category:Fossils of England Category:Jurassic Scotland Category:Fossils of Scotland Category:Fossil taxa described in 1979 ","title":"Wareolestes"},{"id":"53964406","text":"This is a list of electoral district results for the 2007 New South Wales state election.

She later became a slave mistress of a wealthy Venetian citizen of Crete, with whom she had two daughters. Margaret was able to return to Hungary in 1405. Family background Margaret was born into the Döbrönte branch of the influential Himfi noble family. Her father Benedict Himfi governed the Hungarian-occupied Vidin and the surrounding areas as Ban of Bulgaria from 1366 to 1369. Her mother was Dorothea Essegvári, whose family originated from the Lőrinte kindred. Margaret's exact date of birth is unknown but her father died in October 1380. She also had a brother Nicholas, a courtly knight. After becoming a widow, Dorothea joined the Saint Catherine's Monastery of Veszprém in 1385 and adopted the name of Margaret. According to Benedict's last will and testament, the family estates laid mostly in Temes County where he formerly also served as ispán (count). Abduction and slavery During one of the first Ottoman incursions at the borderland of the Kingdom of Hungary, Margaret was abducted from the family seat, the village of Egerszeg in Temes County (today part of Vermeș in Romania). The exact date of the event is indeterminable. Premonstratensian monk and historian L. Bernát Kumorovitz connected the abduction with King Louis I's 1375 campaign against Wallachia which entered into alliance with the Ottoman Empire during the rule of Vladislav I. Margaret's father Benedict compiled his last testament in the next year as intended to pilgrimage to the Holy Land, alongside Voivode Stephen Lackfi. Kumorovitz claimed Benedict started to journey to East to search his abducted daughter. During their pilgrimage, Lackfi also negotiated with Robert de Juilly, Grand Master of the Knights Hospitaller in Rhodes over Hungarian estate matters, and Kumorovitz argued the Knights Hospitaller were also involved in the search inquiry. As Margaret was only found by 1405 and she had two underage children, historian Pál Engel considered 1375 as date of the abduction is too early, as it would be difficult to believe that she was still being searched for thirty years later, and she could not have minor daughters still in 1408. As a result, Engel set 1391 or 1392 as the year of the kidnapping. Péter E. Kovács highlighted Benedict Himfi has been granted permission to journey to the Holy Land already on 27 June 1375, when the Wallachian campaign was still happening. As Margaret has not forgotten her origin, kinship and native language, the date of 1391–92 is more acceptable, as she had to be more than eleven years old during the abduction (Benedict died in 1380), but she could have still minor children in 1405. E. Kovács argued it is also possible that Margaret was abducted and enslaved by Ottoman marauders during a small skirmish, and not during a large-scale campaign. Historian Enikő Csukovits also considered 1391 or 1392 as the year of the event. Sometimes before 1405, Margaret was sold to Crete which then was overseas colony of the Republic of Venice under the name Kingdom of Candia. She became a slave mistress of a wealthy citizen, Giorgio Darvasio, who came from a Venetian merchant family. His father Marco already settled down on Crete, while his mother Ysabeta signed her last testament in Venice in 1416. It is plausible that Giorgio was born on Crete and inherited a large fortune from his father. He had strong business ties with the powerful Mocenigo family (when Margaret still resided on Crete, Tommaso Mocenigo, who later became doge, ruled the island as Duke of Candia). Margaret had two daughters from his slave master; Marieta and Iacoba, who were still minors in 1405 and even in 1408. According to that charter which narrated Margaret's story, the lady was well treated by his slave master and lover Darvasio during her captivity. Thus he was possibly attached to her emotionally. Return to Hungary Despite her relative good fate in Darvasio's estate, Margaret never gave up her intention to return to Hungary. On 1 July 1405, a charter was issued on Crete in the case of the noblewoman. Accordingly, Nicholas Marcali, a former Voivode of Transylvania personally arrived to the island in order to liberate Margaret. Darvasio agreed to release her without any ransom and also took an escort for her mistress. Initially he wanted one of their daughters to stay on Crete, but later his only condition was occasional visit opportunity to Hungary to see her former slave and their two children. As Marcali was not a relative of the Himfi family, it is uncertain why he was chosen to go for Margaret. As he failed to take the noblewoman back to home after the arrangement, it is probable he may have been asked because he intended to travel with some other purpose, for instance Christian pilgrimage or diplomatic mission. In addition, Marcali was regarded as one of the Hungarian barons, thus he could be more influential during the conclusion of the contract than a lesser nobleman. In the charter, Marcali expressed his intention to return to Crete for Margaret and the two children. Marcali's mission proved that Margaret finally was able to contact with her kinship in Hungary, and her memory has preserved at home by that year. As she was a slave, there was no need for requesting authorization from the Venetian authority which regulated the free travel of islanders on Crete. Darvasio transferred Margaret and their daughters to Venice in order to travel to Hungary. There he hand them over to Margaret's alleged brother-in-law John of Redel, and also covered her travel expenses. As there is no record of such relative with that name in the genealogical data, it is possible she was conned and robbed during the journey. Nevertheless, Margaret was able to return to Hungary after lengthy years and resided in Buda with her children. On 1 July 1408, Darvasio turned to the Great Council of Venice to complain that neither Nicholas Marcali nor John of Redel did not reimburse travel expenses. The Council forwarded the message to Sigismund, King of Hungary and asked for his intervention. On 10 November 1408, Francesco Bernardi, a Florentine-origin burgher responded a letter to his unidentified friend, who wrote to him on 21 August. According to this, Margaret, who spoke better in Italian than Hungarian, was a regular guest in his house at Buda, the Hungarian capital. As an esteemed member of the Italian community in Hungary, Bernardi received Darvasio's demands and promised his intercession to the royal court. According to him, his \\"late friend\\", Benedict Himfi had commissioned Bernardi to send 200 gold to Padua in 1373, but before her arrival, he did not know Margaret's fate. Bernardi served as ispán to collect thirtieth () in the 1390s. Though he was arrested and a large portion of his assets was confiscated in 1402, to the pressure of the German community, he retained his influence at the royal court and the Hungarian nobility. In his letter, Bernardi stated he supports financially Margaret Himfi and also reassured Darvasio through his unidentified friend that the Himfis – namely Benedict II, son of Nicholas I, her late brother and Stephen from the Remete branch – took care of the woman. He called Margaret as \\"trustworthy\\" and \\"patient\\", \\"and [she is] not at all frivolous\\". According to the letter, Margaret spoke of her former slave master with the greatest respect. Bernardi confirmed Marcali has not met yet Margaret at the time of writing the letter, and she \\"is waiting for him\\". He added, Marcali probably will not help her when he arrives to Buda, because he is a \\"typical Hungarian\\". He argued the Hungarian lord made a mistake when helped Margaret to return to Hungary, because those women who were abducted and enslaved before becoming concubines in such circumstances, were considered as a shame for the female kinship in Hungary. Bernardi promised he will adopt Marieta and Iacoba as his legitimate children, if Marcali or the Himfis refuse to take care Margaret and her minor daughters hereinafter. Bernardi's letter was the last information about Margaret. After her return to Hungary, Darvasio left Crete for Venice. There lying on his deathbed, he made his last will and testament on 20 February 1413. According to his intention, one of his freed Tatar slaves and mistress was supposed to inherit 10 ducat and several fabrics, while another concubine received 20 ducats to \\"raise her children\\" who were probably fathered by Darvasio himself. He did not mention Margaret and their two daughters in his last will. He was buried at the Scuola di Santa Maria della Misericordia.

Her life was dedicated to providing aid to the poor, with particular emphasis on education, first in Aachen and later in the Netherlands. A decree introducing her cause for beatification was issued in 1958 by Pope Pius XII, at which time she became titled a Servant of God. In 1991, following confirmation of her heroic virtue by Pope John Paul II, she was titled Venerable. Pope Francis confirmed a miraculous healing attributed to her intercession on 4 May 2017. Her beatification was celebrated in Aachen on 5 May 2018. Life Young Clara Fey Clara Fey was born on 11 April 1815 in Aachen, the fourth of five children of wealthy textile industrialist Louis and his wife Katherine. Louis was to die following a stroke in 1820, when Clara was aged five years. Fey studied under noted teacher Luise Hensel and became acquainted with Pauline von Mallinckrodt and Franziska Schevier. In her childhood she observed the poor conditions in her town and was resolved to aid the poor in their suffering more so because of the importance her mother placed on helping those less fortunate than herself. To that end she would later set up a school with some likeminded friends in Aachen in 1837 in order to cater to the educational needs of poor children. Fey's brother Andreas would go on to become a priest, later serving as the vicar of the Saint Paul parish in Aachen. On 2 February 1844, Fey established the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus in Aachen, as a means of leading children to Jesus Christ and educating children in a religious environment. Around 1835 she started to read the works of Teresa of Ávila and professed a desire to become a Carmelite nun. In 1841, however, her spiritual advisor Wilhelm Sartorius motivated her to instead read the works of Francis de Sales for greater theological inspiration. Fey made her vows as a nun in 1850. Her order received diocesan approval on 28 January 1848 from the Archbishop of Cologne and a papal decree of praise from Pope Pius IX on 11 July 1862, with full papal approval for the order issued by Pope Leo XIII on 15 June 1888. The Rule of her order would be based on the teachings of Augustine of Hippo. Fey served as the order's first superior general from its founding until her death despite her frail health and frequent bouts of illness. In 1875, the Kulturkampf forced her and the order to relocate to the Netherlands where she remained until her death in May 1894. After her death a devotional cult began at the site of her grave in Simpelveld. Beatification Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus carrying banners of the beatified Clara Fey in the Relics Procession in Maastricht, May 2018 The beatification process opened in Roermond in an informative process that lasted from 1916 until its closure in 1924 while a second inquest was held from 1923 until 1924; one final process – the apostolic one – was held from 1963 until being closed in 1967. The formal introduction to the cause came on 11 August 1958 under Pope Pius XII and she became titled as a Servant of God. Officials from the cause compiled and submitted the Positio dossier in 1983 to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints. Theologians investigated and approved it on 29 May 1990 as did the C.C.S. officials on 26 February 1991. The late religious was named as Venerable on 14 May 1991 after Pope John Paul II confirmed that she had lived a model life of heroic virtue. Pope Francis authorized the promulgation of a decree on 4 May 2017 approving a miracle attributed to her intercession; this allowed for her to be beatified in Aachen on 5 May 2018.

Refugees across the border in Serbia planned the rebellion and rose up together with villagers from the area during a scheduled meeting of the two sides agreed upon by the Serbian Prince Miloš Obrenović, the community protector, and the Vali of Rumelia. He had promised to help the rebels, but broke out his promise and remained loyal to the Ottoman Sultan. The Serbian prince suppressed the rebels and punished the fugitives. Background In the aftermath of the Serbian Revolution (1804–17), in which several commanders from the Pirot area participated in and during which also a part of the Pirot nahiya was liberated, and the Serbian rebel army engaged the Ottomans in the vicinity of Pirot,, , some locals saved themselves from zulum (cruelty, oppression, persecution) and fled to the newly established Principality of Serbia. From there, some organized into hajduk bands that crossed Knjaževac (formerly Gurgusovac) into Ottoman territory. Due to the Serbian Revolution and influence of the Principality of Serbia, the Ottomans viewed suspiciously of Pirot. During the Greek Revolution (1821–29), the locals turned to Prince Miloš for aid and protection. There was a dispute between Serbia and the Ottoman Empire in 1831–34 over border demarcation in the Stara Planina area; Prince Miloš tried hard to have the western part ceded to Serbia, which failed, as the new borders were set up and held officially until 1878. In January 1835, 16 villages in Lower Ponišavlje rose up due to Ottoman zulum; the rebellion was suppressed with the mediation of Prince Miloš. The zulum continued however and a large group of villagers therefore migrated to Serbia. Another rebellion broke out in March, in which 100 rebels died; the rebellion was suppressed, again with the mediation of Prince Miloš and his minister Avram Petronijević. Pirot was a larger town, inhabited by Orthodox Christians and Muslims, estimated to have had a population of 6–8,000. It suffered greatly from plague in 1834, 1835 and 1836. Prelude Serbian Prince Miloš Obrenović was the mediator, as protector of the Orthodox population south of Serbia, in the events surrounding the rebellion. In 1836, the ayan (leader) in Pirot was Mahmud the Kapıcıbaşı, while the Orthodox bishop was Hieronymos, a Greek., These two acted in concert, and amerced and oppressed the population. Between 27 January and 10 April, 726 people fled to Serbia. Due to this, the community leader Hadži-Neša Filipović, a wealthy and respected man, left Pirot for Knjaževac (since 1833 part of Serbia) with a large group of people when complaints to the Vali of Rumelia at Bitola bore no fruit. At this time, relations between Serbia and Pirot were intimate. Mahmud and Hieronymos sent 17 locals to the Vali who pictured the refugees as miserable and restless people, wanting to justify themselves, and on 5 March 1836 sent Đorđe Kokal and Alija, a Turk, to Knjaževac to try to persuade the refugees to return home. The refugees at Knjaževac answered that none of them would return as long as those two leaders were present in Pirot. Distributed over the area of Knjaževac and neighbouring villages, the refugees began arming themselves and readying for a rebellion in the Pirot area. The situation became serious, as seen in the Vali of Rumelia sending a mühürdar (an Ottoman official, \\"seal-keeper\\") to Pirot, while Prince Miloš Obrenović sent his minister Avram Petronijević and the commander of the Danube-Timok army Stevan Stojanović to Knjaževac, where these two met with the mühürdar on 6 May 1836. The mühürdar had been assured of the oppression by Mahmud and Hieronymos already in Pirot, and promised in Knjaževac that the population will not suffer again, and proposed that the refugees return home with Hadži-Neša, whom the kocabaşı title, signifying the rayah chief, would be given and as such Mahmud could not do without him. Prince Miloš messaged Petronijević on 7 May, asking him to collect all refugees from Pirot and talk them into returning home, and that he together with Hadži-Neša safely bring them back to Pirot. Furthermore, Prince Miloš demanded that bishop Hieronymos and Hadji Hasan Efendi, whom ayan Mahmud blamed for everything, be banished (sürgün, exile from the region). Petronijević managed to return the larger part of the refugees back to Pirot, and informed Prince Miloš of this on 11 May. Prince Miloš sent Hadži-Neša to Pirot but stressed that if he did not feel safe, he must return to Serbia. Petronijević wrote from Pirot on 21 May that Hadži-Neša had been well-received by ayan Mahmud and the mühürdar, and that Hadži-Neša had called on some people from over the nahiya to come to Pirot in two days to discuss how to bring order and reduce poverty. Hadži-Neša had called 15–20 people from each srez (rural municipality), but the plot unraveled, and 8,000 men armed with rifles and tools rallied at Pirot on 24 May; the priests had visited all villages and raised people. Rebellion The Turks were alarmed, and armed conflict broke out on the streets, during which Hadži-Neša was caught in the midst of a large group of villagers who had a shootout with the Turks. In the mediation between Petronijević and the mühürdar, the Turks retreated to the Pirot Fortress. The villagers did not want to scatter and remained around the town in large groups, numbering 500–1,000 each. Among these were people from the regions of Visok, Nišava and Lužnica. Those from Visok were most active. Between 25 and 28 May Petronijević tried to calm down the villagers, but to no avail, stating that \\"they want that no Turk remain, and that if the Turks do not leave voluntarily, they will attack the town. They say that they only wait for You to send cannons and aid, as promised to them\\". At the beginning of the turmoil, Prince Miloš made the Porte immediately replace ayan Mahmud, and they appointed Nektarios from Lemnos the new bishop. Ottoman troops were sent from Sofia and Leskovac. Prince Miloš recommended that Petronijević work on calming down the rebellion and have the Albanian crew at Pirot replaced by nızamı (a westernized military corps), \\"Imperial people\\". The seriousness of the rebellion, that it threatened to \\"lit up Turkey\\", is seen from Prince Miloš's letter of 31 May: \\"...We say this because that Pirot turmoil is very dangerous, because all of Bosnia is again in motion, and the fire has spread even to [Novi] Pazar... God forbid that it erupts from Pirot, it may combine with the Bosnian [rebellion] and Albanian [rebellion] from Pazar, and it would be a great evil, which we do not know who would [manage to] silence.\\" On the Sunday of 29 May, in the afternoon, many villagers came to the town market, which frightened the local Turks who then took up arms. The bazaar was shut down and the Turks went towards the Tijabar neighbourhood, but the Ottoman army from Sofia kept them at the town bridge and refused them to continue. At the beginning of June, \\"peace and order\\" was restored. A number of priests were killed by the Turks during the rebellion. The population were satisfied with the new ayan, the powerful Hadji Mehmed Bey Serezli. On 27 June, in the name of citizens of Pirot, Hadži-Neša, Hadži-Ćira Nešović, Viden Jovanović, Cvetko Teodorović, Đorđe Cenović, Mika Krstović, Stamen Caribrodski, Panajot Pop-Jović, Đorđe Jelenić, Živko Stefanović, Ćira Mladžić and Hadži-Pavle with a warm letter thanked Prince Miloš on his commitment to Pirot affairs and prayed that he would not forget them. The letter was stamped with the Pirot municipality seal, a white double-headed eagle. Prince Miloš replied on 2 July. In August, another rebellion broke out in the Pirot area. A large group of villagers met up at the Temska monastery on 2 August, and in the evening went toward Pirot crossing the Gradašnica river. Petronijević was again sent to \\"calm down the rayah\\", and managed to have the ringleader, a Cvetko, imprisoned and persuaded the villagers to stop. Cvetko was executed on 9 August at Prince Miloš's command and put on a wheel at the Ottoman–Serbian border. It seems that Prince Miloš sought to challenge rebellion as to receive mandate from the Sultan to calm down the rebellious rayah and gain authority upon them, and towards the Porte tried to show himself as a loyal vassal as to remove any possible insinuations. The leaders of the rebellions in Pirot were village priests. Aftermath The Pirot municipality and district continued cordial relations and connections with Serbia and Prince Miloš. Hadži-Neša came into conflict with the new bishop Nektarios due to defending folk interest, and was therefore exiled from Pirot to Anatolia in the summer by the Ottoman government, but after Prince Miloš's intervention in September 1836 Hadži-Neša was ordered to live in Sofia (where he also died). In February 1840, Prince Mihailo Obrenović and his mother Ljubica visited Pirot on their return from Constantinople. Prince Mihailo gave refuge to hajduks from Pirot who wintered in Serbia and plundered in the Pirot area during the summers. On 6 April 1841, a rebellion broke out around Niš, Pirot, Leskovac and Prokuplje, due to Turk zulum. It was suppressed by 10,000 Ottoman soldiers at the beginning of the summer. Pirot was liberated in the Serbian–Ottoman War (1876–1878) and ceded to Serbia according to the Congress of Berlin (1878). Assessment The government of the Principality of Serbia was highly engaged in minimizing the Ottomans disapproval of the Pirot inhabitants for their large emigration to Serbia and the rebellion itself. Thanks to Prince Miloš's relations in the Porte and his influence on some of its officials, the Pirot inhabitants were saved from heavy repression. Serbian intervention led to Pirot's appointment of a local kocabaşı, amnesty, and notable improvement of tax liability and overall Serbian–Ottoman affairs.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. History Henry Sandenburgh was born in Prussia in 1853. He emigrated to the United States, married, and arrived in Williamsport in 1878 as a fisherman. Sandenburgh and his wife Mary purchased the lot this resort is on in 1880, and built a house which is no longer extant. They took in a boarder. In 1882, the couple constructed the main house of this complex, which allowed them to house four boarders. The Sandenburghs also lived in the house, along with their children. In 1908, Mary Sandenburgh purchased the Hotel Onekama in Onekama, Michigan and the family moved there. The Williamsport house was rented for the summer of 1908, and sold to William P. and Belle C. Rogers in 1909. Henry Sandenburgh died in 1913, and his wife Mary continued to operate the hotel until her death in 1928. William P. Rogers was born in Bloomington, Indiana in 1857. He attended Indiana State University at Terre Haute, Columbia Law School, and practiced law and joined the Law Department at Indiana University. He soon became dean of the department, and in 1902 became dean of the Cincinnati Law School. He became involved in a number of community and business interests in Cincinnati, and eventually resigned his law school position to focus more on business. Rogers and his wife were one of the first resorters to discover the Onekama area. William Rogers died in 1921, leaving his wife Belle and daughters Kathryn and Norine as the principal family members in the Williamsport house. They developed the outbuildings and grounds of the complex, remodeling the house and adding a studio designed by the prefabricated building makers E. F. Hodgson Company. Description The Sandenburgh-Rogers Summer Resort Complex consists of six structures: the summer residence, guest house, garage, studio, stables, and a maintenance building containing an apartment. The buildings are situated in two acres of landscaped grounds. *Summer Residence (1882-83) The summer residence was constructed by Henry Sandenburgh, and renovated in 1919-20 and again in 1936 and c. 1940. It is a two-story, side-gabled Colonial Revival structure with a single story gabled wing at the rear. It has a symmetrical facade, with screened second-story porches on each side. *Guest House (1882-83) The guest house was likely constructed as a barn around the time the main house was built. It is a symmetrical single story gable-roofed structure with a steeply pitched roof and a central entry porch protected by a canopy supported by two square pillars. The building is clad with weatherboard and sits on a cement slab foundation. *Garage The Garage is a single story hipped-roof structure with two automobile bays. It is clad with weatherboard and has an asphalt shingle roof. *Studio (1935) The studio was built for Kathryn Gates, Rogers's daughter, who was a painter. It is a prefabricated structure made by E. F. Hodgson Company, and is a single story, asymmetrical Colonial Revival structure with a hipped roof and a small off-center small entry porch supported by classical columns. *Stable The stable is a single story rectangular building with a front-gable wing at each end containing five stalls. The sides are clad with asbestos shingles and the roof with asphalt shingles. *Maintenance Building The maintenance building is a single story structure with an additional on the rear and wings on each end. The main structure has a hipped roof, the wings have side-gable roofs, and the read addition has a shed roof. The entire roof is covered with asphalt shingles, and the majority of the building is clad with asbestos siding.

She was born in Alexandria in Egypt in 1908 and died in Athens, Greece in April 1989. She wrote a single book, Her Lover, which was published in Athens in 1929, and again in 2005. Biographical information The name 'Dora Rosetti' was the pseudonym of Eleni or Nelli Kaloglopoulou-Bogiatzoglou.Eleni Bakopoulou, Η φίλη μου κυρία Ντόρα Ρωζέττη, εκδόσεις Οδός Πανός, 2012 Αθήνα. My Friend Mrs Dora Rosetti, :el:Odos Panos Publications, 2012 Athens. Dora Rosetti/Nelli Kaloglopoulou came to Athens from Alexandria and studied at the Medical School of Athens University. She wrote from an early age, and was an active contributor to the literary journal for talented young persons titled Diaplasis ton Paidon (Cultivating the Young), edited by famous literary critic and writer Grigorios Ksenopoulos. Through this journal, she developed a literary and artistic group of friends and interlocutors. Grigorios Ksenopoulos thought very highly of her writing, as becomes clear from his comments to her and the correspondence published in the journal Diaplasis ton Paidon.Eleni Bakopoulou, Η φίλη μου κυρία Ντόρα Ρωζέττη, εκδόσεις Οδός Πανός, 2012 Αθήνα. My Friend Mrs Dora Rosetti, Odos Panos Publications, 2012 Athens According to the testimony of Dora Rosetti to Eleni Bakopoulou, Rosetti's friends, the poets Giorgos Tsoukalas and G. Simiriotis, had read the texts in her literary diary and appreciated her talent. In conversation with her, they edited the text into a novel and published it, with her agreement: they wrote the final book ending, gave the author the pseudonym ‘Dora Rosetti’ and chose the book title, Her Lover. (In Greek, the book title makes the gender of the two lovers explicit, hence announcing its subject matter). The book caused a scandal in its time due to its taboo topic of lesbian love between women. It also inadvertently ‘photographed’ the real-life persons behind the two central characters of the novel, and rendered them recognisable to society. Due to careless editing, the book included enough biographical detail for the real life persons to be identifiable behind the fiction. Hence, the author, alone or with her girlfriend, and under the weight of significant social pressure, opprobrium and shame, gathered existing copies from bookstores and destroyed a large proportion. (Re)discovery and reprint of the book The book disappeared and was nowhere to be found for decades, until the philologist, academic and researcher Christina Dounia rediscovered it in two private libraries (first, in the Eleutheriadis residence in Petra, Lesvos, and later on in the Kavafy archive, where there is a copy inscribed by the author to the Alexandrian poet). Dounia republished it in 2005, with an accompanying afterword.Ντόρα Ρωζέττη, Η ερωμένη της, επιμ. επίμετρο: Χριστίνα Ντουνιά The real identity of Rosetti when her book was republished was still unknown, and became a matter of feverish speculation among journalists, literary critics, authors and the book-reading public of Greece.  Shedding light on the author  Soon after the publication of the novel, Eleni Bakopoulou, an intellectual and activist for the rights of women, lesbians and gay men since the 1980s, brought to light and published documents on Rosetti that she had meticulously kept in her drawers for many years. The narration of Bakopoulou's encounter with the author, and the personal and archival material that Rosetti entrusted to Bakopoulou, were published in two consecutive issues of the literary journal Odos Panos (132, 133). Later on, in 2012, these texts were published as a book titled My Friend Mrs Dora Rosetti, by Odos Panos Publications.Eleni Bakopoulou, Η φίλη μου κυρία Ντόρα Ρωζέττη, εκδόσεις Οδός Πανός, 2012 Αθήνα. My Friend Mrs Dora Rosetti, Odos Panos Publications, 2012 Athens, Greece. Dora Rosetti was clearly a talented writer, as is manifest from her only book. As she suggests in her testimony to Eleni Bakopoulou, she kept writing throughout her life, by keeping a literary journal.Eleni Bakopoulou, Η φίλη μου κυρία Ντόρα Ρωζέττη, εκδόσεις Οδός Πανός, 2012 Αθήνα. My Friend Mrs Dora Rosetti, Odos Panos Publications, 2012 Athens. However, the uproar caused by her daring description and the book's narration of a woman's love for another woman, which is the book's main theme, had as a consequence the destruction and total disappearance of the book, as well as the stigmatisation of its author. Her testimony to Bakopoulou suggests that, besides her first book, she was also forced to destroy all of her other writing and potential literary production, and her archive.  The course of a lifetime  Nelli Kaloglopoulou-Dora Rosetti was 21 years old when her book 'Her Lover' was published. After graduating from university, she worked as a doctor mostly in Greece, but also in Egypt and in Libya. She studied further and specialised in public health. She also completed a PhD in medicine. She married Kostikas Bogiatzoglou (1895–1967), a diaspora Greek from Romania. Outside her profession, she enjoyed mountaineering, cave exploration (together with Anna Petroheilou, a well-known cave-explorer), played tennis and was a classical music lover. From 1961 until her death in 1989, she lived in Athens, in a small apartment at 25 Makedonias Street on the corner of Aharnon avenue. After her initial writing and publication adventure with Her Lover, Rosetti did not publish anything else. Her work and life came to light partly through the discussions that she had in 1983–84 with the activist and researcher Eleni Bakopoulou, who had sought her out. Bakopoulou carefully kept Rosetti's testimony and her texts in her drawers for many years and waited, as she had promised Rosetti not to publish anything on, or by her as long as she was still alive. After the publication of 'Her Lover' in 2005, Bakopoulou, after making sure that Rosetti had passed away, published in 2006 in Odos Panos Journal (32:2006) the autobiographical testimony that Rosetti gave her, together with her own account of their meeting. She also included in the publication earlier texts that Rosetti had published in Diaplasis ton Paidon, and material from a drawing and poetry journal that Rosetti had given her.  The novel Her Lover  After a first reprint in 2005, Her Lover had further reprints in 2006, 2011, and in 2013. The book is written in the first person, and follows and records, in impressionistic style and through diary-style entries, the life and subjective, inner world of university student Dora, her passionate love for another woman, her student circles, hangouts, excursions, trips to the countryside and walks in the streets of Athens. The book was published under the editorial supervision of Christina Dounia, professor of Modern Greek Language and Literature at the University of Crete, who also wrote an afterword to the book. Included in the publication is also Grigorios Ksenopoulos's book review of Her Lover written in 1929, in the literary review journal Nea Estia (Volume 6).

It has a rosette of leaves near its base and up to seven dark brown to blackish flowers with a dark brown, insect-like labellum. It is only found in the Little Desert area. Description Pterostylis cheraphila is a terrestrial, perennial, deciduous, herb with an underground tuber. It has a rosette of between six and twelve leaves at the base of the flowering spike, each leaf long and wide. Up to seven dark brown to blackish flowers long and wide are borne on a flowering spike tall. Three to five stem leaves are wrapped around the flowering spike. The dorsal sepal and petals form a hood called the \\"galea\\" over the column with the dorsal sepal having a thread-like tip long. The lateral sepals are wider than the galea, dished and have densely hairy edges. They taper suddenly to narrow, thread-like tips long and are more or less parallel to each other. The labellum is dark brown, thin and insect- like, long and about wide. The edges of the labellum are wavy, with short, bristly hairs and there are two longer bristles near the \\"head\\" end. Flowering occurs from October to November. Taxonomy and naming Pterostylis cheraphila was first formally described in 1993 by David Jones & Mark Clements from a specimen collected near Dimboola and the description was published in Muelleria. The specific epithet (cheraphila) is said to be derived from the Greek words cheras meaning \\"alluvium\\", \\"silt\\" or \\"detritus\\" and philo meaning \\"loving\\", referring to the soil type where this species usually grows. In ancient Greek, philos (φίλος) is the word for \\"loving\\".Liddell, H.G. & Scott, R. (1940). A Greek-English Lexicon.

It was released on 3 March 2015 by independent record label American Patchwork on CD and distributed by Darla Records.  Background  For \\"Ultra-Loyal Sheepdog,\\" Momus created \\"a simulacrum of Japanese stereotypes of English, notions of cuteness in Japan and notions of sheep [...] fascinated by the way sheep are portrayed (in Japan) — a land in which one never sees an actual sheep.\\" Turpsycore is a triple album dedicated to music's \\"so-called 'eccentrics'.\\" Two out of three of discs are cover versions of David Bowie and Magazine/the Buzzcocks Howard Devoto. The song \\"Ultra-Loyal Sheepdog\\" began as a Tumblr post in March 2014 when the musician wrote a biography on one of the characters in Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's \\"Mottai Night Land\\" video. The title is a deliberate misspelling of Terpsichore, the muse for joy and dance in Greek mythology. Likewise, the name is a nod to turpentine and turpitude. Also relating to Greek mythology, Momus is the god of mockery and blame. The color palette is a reference to Greece's polychrome technique. His later album Glyptothek was published in the same year. Songs from Turpsycore and from other 2000s albums Bambi, Bibliotek, and Glyptothek were recollected in the Cherry Red Records anthology Public Intellectual.  Production  The content of the first disc was originally published by Sony Music Japan. The second and third discs of Turpsycore were recorded at the \\"cabaret concerts\\" in London's Cafe Oto in September 2014. The cover is designed by Hagen Verleger. It was nominated by the German Design Council for the German Design Award.  Reception  Bristol's Cube Microplex staff called Turpsycore \\"a triple disc spectacular.\\" The Japan Timess Devon Fisher commented \\"[Momus] pays proper tribute to the artists — some famous, some less so — who, like him in his Shibuya-kei days, brought a more literate, worldly and bizarre perspective to the realm of popular culture, refusing to stagnate or get 'over-familiar and over-sold.'\\" Zittys Thorsten Glotzmann said it was \\"thoroughly enigmatic and bizarre - overloaded with literary, film-historical and pop-cultural references.\\" Heathen Harvest staff reviewed it favorably stating \\"A good Momus album plus a two bonus discs of off-kilter covers of David Bowie and Howard Devoto songs. What’s not to like about it?\\" PopMatterss Dave Heaton remarked the album was \\"a truly eccentric three-disc set.\\" CDMs Peter Kirn called the Bowie disc \\"unsurprising\\" but the Devoto covers \\"were just what I (didn’t know I) needed – a set of songs tackling sexual ambiguity and anxiety from a singer who was born to play the part.\\"  Track listing  References  External links  * * Category:2015 albums Category:Momus (musician) albums ","title":"Turpsycore"},{"id":"53965114","text":"Walter \\"Walt\\" Tennant (1 January 1921 – death unknown) was an English professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

History Simeon Babcock was born on July 1, 1832, near Utica, New York. His parents moved to Ohio, then Wisconsin, and by 1852 Babcock moved to Milwaukee and went into business for himself as a master carpenter and contractor. In 1870, Babcock partnered with Michael Engelmann to open a lumber business in Milwaukee, and in 1873 Ernest N. Salling of Manistee joined the partnership. The company built a mill in Manstee to provide lumber, and when Salling retired in 1877, Babcock moved to Manistee. In 1881, he built this house for himself. Babcock lived in the house until his death in 1896.> After Babcock died, his wife Sarah remained in the house until her own death in 1912. In 1915, the couple's daughter Ella sold the house to R. W. Smith, and in 1917 Smith rented the house to Philip P. Schnorbach, one of the leading industrialists in Manistee during the first half of the twentieth century. The Schnorbach continued renting the house until 19230, when they purchased it from Smith. Philip Schnorbach died in 1945, and his wife continued to live there until 1956. In 1961, the house was sold to Mrs. Alice M. Hunt Catlow, who sold it to her brother-in-law, John Noud Kelly, in 1963. Kelly lived in the house until 1994. In 1995, the house was sold to John Perschbacher, who continues to own the house. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on November 30, 1999. Description The house is a three-story brick structure measuring approximately fifty feet by sixty-two feet. The roof is a combination of gable and mansard types, and the entire house is somewhat asymmetrical, exhibiting an eclectic combination of High Victorian architectural styles, including Stick, Eastlake, and Second Empire. Two-story bay windows are located on three facades, and a three-story octagonal tower penetrates the roofline. The front entryway contains an elaborate pair of arched double doors. On the interior, the first floor contains an entry hall, two parlors, a dining room, kitchen and library. The front hall has a parquet floor using contrasting woods, and the dining room has plaster molding and built-in china cupboard in the bay area. Woodwork made from pine, oak, maple, walnut, cherry, and rosewood is located throughout the house. An elaborate open staircase with turned balusters leads upward to the second and third stories. The second floor contains four principal bedrooms, a linen closet and a back hall. The third floor contains a large, roughly plastered room with several smaller rooms opening off from it.

In 2014 Service made the first of a series of documentaries with historian Amanda Vickery, produced by Reef Television for the BBC, titled Messiah at the Foundling Hospital. The programme received mixed reviews with The Daily Telegraph criticising the delivery of both presenters and its inaccuracies and The Arts Desk being very positive. A second film, La traviata: Love, Death and Divas followed in 2016. The third film, also in 2016 with Amanda Vickery, was the documentary Leningrad & the Orchestra that Defied Hitler for BBC Two about the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the performance of Symphony No. 7 (Leningrad Symphony) by Dmitri Shostakovich. In 2015 Service wrote and presented The Joy of Mozart, a documentary for BBC Four, which The Daily Telegraph described as \\"joyous\\" and \\"richly enjoyable\\".

Suzy Klein of New Statesman also found it to be \\"excellent\\", while expressing disappointment that the conductors themselves weren't able to clearly describe \\"what makes an exceptional, alchemical conductor\\". The Economist found the interview portions \\"not particularly rewarding\\" but said \\"the book's strength is in its mix of stories and perspectives\\". In 2013, Service collaborated with composer and conductor Thomas Adès to write the book Thomas Adès: Full of Noises. Conversations with Tom Service. Opera News described the book as \\"two hundred pages of brilliant talk\\" and said of Service that \\"there's no doubting the intelligence he brings to the project\\".

She was one of the pioneering members of the Norwegian Labour Party's Women's Federation which she chaired almost without interruption from 1904 to 1920. From 1901 to 1918 she served as the only woman on the Labour Party's central committee and chaired Christiania's city council from 1908 to 1919. In 1909, she became the first Norwegian women to become a parliamentary candidate when she stood in the constituency of Hammersborg, although she was not elected. Biography Martha Ottomine Steen was born on 5 November 1870 in Florø on the west coast, the daughter of Ole Olsen Steen, a merchant, and Karen Martine Hauge. In 1894, she married Lars Larsen Tynæs, a house painter, who died while she was still young in 1910. She became one of the most influential women in the Norwegian women's movement, clearly stating her case at the Labour Party's congress in 1899 when she asked: \\"Why are women so lethargic and indifferent about the workers' movement and their social conditions?\\" Her talents as a public speaker and activist served her both in the party and in the Women's Federation. She was able to impact municipal policy-making in a variety of areas, including schools, living conditions, and facilities for children and the elderly. She contributed in particular to developing legislation for children born outside of wedlock. Widowed while still young, she was left with the responsibility of raising three children. In the Women's Federation, she helped to build up membership by establishing six new affiliates in the various districts of Christiania, leading to hundreds of new supporters. The organization's annual meeting in 1909 extended the organization's mandate to cover the whole of Norway. One of her most important political successes was in achieving full voting rights for women in 1913. Martha Tynæs (right) with the Labour Party's central committee Tynæs was above all concerned with issues related to the working classes rather than those differentiating women from men, inspired by the writings of Ferdinand Lassalle, August Bebel, Karl Marx and Peter Kropotkin. Her goal was always to involve women in the fight for political socialism. In 1921, she left the Labour Party to join the newly established Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway (which in fact merged with the Labour Party in 1927). Tynæs began to cut back on her responsibilities from 1918 owing to failing health, resigning from her chairmanship of the Women's Federation in 1920. Together with Gunhild Ziener and a number of the other early members, she founded Norway's Social Democratic Women's Federation (Norges Sosialdemokratiske Kvinneforbund) in 1922. After a long illness, Martha Tynæs died on 8 January 1930 in Oslo, widely recognized for her intelligence, kindness and collaborative skills.

Baxter, the founder of the original London-based paper. Along with the newspaper, Spurgeon also ran a charity under the same auspices devoted to poor relief and evangelizing. Thomas De Witt Talmage served as editor from 1890 to 1902. In 1898, the Herald was purchased by Louis Klopsch, who further expanded the charitable operations and spread the publication to overseas locations. The magazine dealt with domestic inequality, Christian–Muslim encounters abroad, and Americans’ ambivalent attitudes about the suffering of distant others. Klopsch also operated a summer camp in the New York suburbs for Christian youth activities. In 1927, Reverend Daniel A. Poling became the editor, a post he held until 1966. In 1948, the Herald started the \\"Family Bookshelf,\\" a book subscription group of Christian-friendly literature. The summer camp was relocated to the Poconos in 1961 as suburban development encroached on the original location. Declining circulation forced the Herald to relocate from Manhattan to Chappaqua, New York, in 1971. By 1992, the newspaper ceased publication, but the charitable outreach arm still exists, having relocated back to Manhattan in 1998. In the early months of 2006, The Christian Herald, having ceased any and all publications, was dissolved.

It was utilized as a public school building from 1905 until the late 1980s. The building was designated a Mississippi Landmark in 1991. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008.  Description  The original Eaton School building is a two-story brick structure with a 12-bay front facade that contains round- arch window frames and a hip roof, previously covered with asphalt shingles. A stucco finish was applied to the brick outer walls at an unspecified date. The ground-level entrance on the north facade was topped with a round-arch transom. A steel fire escape for the second floor is mounted on the west end of the front facade. The south facade was less ornate, with an entrance door on the first floor flanked by 4 arched window frames on the east end and 10 windows in arched frames on the second floor. The east elevation contains 7 arched window frames on the first and second floors. The center window frame on the second floor of the east elevation contains a metal door for accessing a steel fire escape. The west elevation was modified in 1949 by a one-story cafeteria addition. Both floors of the 1905 building were subdivided into four classrooms, off a central hallway. Plastered walls had beadboard wainscotting at the height of the window sills. Ceilings were also beadboard.  History  The original building is believed to have been designed by Hattiesburg architect Robert E. Lee and was constructed in 1905. The building's Romanesque Revival architectural style was common in early 20th century school designs, but Eaton School is considered by the Mississippi Department of Archives and History (MDAH) to be a unique example of the architecture because the building has survived intact for more than 100 years. The school's name was derived from an early settler, George Eaton, who donated the land where the school was built. In 1949, a one-story, flat-roof, brick addition was constructed on the west end of the original building, under the direction of architects Hearon & McCleskey. It contained three classrooms and a cafeteria/meeting space with a stage. In 1957, a one-story, flat-roof, brick auditorium addition, designed by Associated School Architects, was constructed and connected to the stage from the earlier addition.  Deterioration  By the late 1980s, the original building no longer served as a public school. When it was assessed for National Register status during the first decade of the 21st century, deferred maintenance had resulted in a leaking roof. To prevent further deterioration and begin restoration, a new roof was contracted through open bidding. The roofing project began in November 2009, but had to be redone three times to correctly match the pitch of the original roof, as required by MDAH, to meet historic specifications. By March 2010, the roofing project was nearing completion. But, during that 5-month interval, the building's interior had been exposed to winter rains which weakened the supporting beams on the second floor. A portion of the second floor collapsed and caused a substantial structural crack in the building, thereby leaving the building structurally unsound for the roof to be completed. By 2015, a portion of the roof framing and part of the second story wall had collapsed. Two-ton concrete anchors were used with cables attached to the exterior walls to brace the structure. The City of Hattiesburg and MDAH provided funding to stabilize the school building, and the city intended to apply for grants to restore the structure.

He was the son of Robert Bruce (1668–1720), first commandant of St Petersburg, whose brother was Peter the Great's associate Jacob Bruce. Life On 7 May 1722 he was appointed to the Engineer Corps and later that year he was sent abroad, only returning to Russia in 1726. He was then made a warrant officer and later a cavalryman, before promotion to captain in 1727. In 1729 he became aide de camp to marshal Vasily Vladimirovich Dolgorukov. He also married Vasily's niece Anastasia Mikhailovna Dolgorukova on 26 July 1729 - their son James Bruce (1732–1791) died without male issue and the Russian Bruce line died out when James' only daughter Catherine died childless in 1829. Alexander was sent to the Tsaritsyn Line in 1731. During the War of the Polish Succession in 1733, he was put in command of a newly-formed special regiment. In 1736 he fought in the Russo-Turkish War (1735-1739) and was present in Burkhard Christoph von Münnich's Crimean campaign and the battle at the Solyan lake under the command of Lieutenant General Izmailov. On 9 December 1736 Bruce was promoted to colonel and put in command of the Reval Dragoon Regiment and the following year he was present at the siege of Ochakov. He fought in the 1738 Dniester campaign and the 1739 Moldavian campaign, taking part in the capture of Khotin. On 14 February 1740, after the war's end, he was promoted to major general. For a short time from 29 March 1740 he was also vice-governor of Moscow. At the rank of major general he fought in the Russo-Swedish War (1741–43), during which he was sent to Finland as part of generalissimo James Francis Edward Keith's force, staying there until the end of 1742. His wife died in summer 1745 and in December that year Bruce re-married to Ekaterina Alekseyevna Dolgorukova, another member of the Dolgorukov family and formerly engaged to Peter II of Russia, though she died of a cold shortly after her wedding to Bruce. He then married a third time, to the young Natalia Fedorovna Kolycheva (1730-1777). Alexander retired with the rank of lieutenant general on 25 April 1752. He was also a knight of the Order of Saint Anna. He was buried on his estate at Glinka (now in the town of Losino-Petrovsky) in St John's Church.

History  The farm owes its name to the peasant Erik Andersson (1788-1874), who rebuilt the main residence between 1813 and 1827. Its large reception room and its decorations testify to the wealth of the owner. The family subsequently suffered setbacks that threatened the maintenance of the farm: of the two sons of Erik Andersson, the elder emigrates to the United States while the cadet remains invalid after a horse accident. The property passed into the hands of several families, who set up several kitchens in the first half of the 20th century. The old ancillary buildings were also replaced in the 1910s by a single stable and barn building, among others. The farm buildings have been restored since 1993, in particular with regard to wall paintings and wallpapers..  Architecture et decoration  With its elegant roof and large yellow painted facade, the main building had the appearance of a manor. Over time, the yellow turned red.

Larsen, served in the Danish military in Aalborg. After studying at Aalborg Cathedral School, Larsen became a trainee at M. Kragelund Factories. He then served in the military. Upon completing his service at age 26, he bought P.C. Petersen, an abandoned iron production company, in 1935. At P.C. Petersen, Larsen began working with steel and became interested in steel furniture manufacturing. In 1944, Larsen invented and patented a window lock.Espacenet - Bibliografiske data The lock was child-proof and had a feather mechanism that theoretically could not be drilled through, thereby making it resistant to break-ins.  Career  Picture from the production when the factory was in Fjordgade in Aalborg - start of the 1940s In 1948, Larsen began to focus on the construction of office furniture. Larsen took an interest in office chairs after reading an article in the Journal of Danish Handcraft entitled \\"The Seated Position - and Chairs\\" by Dr. Snorason. The article discussed ergonomics and the importance of furniture that supports proper sitting posture. Larsen then began designing and manufacturing ergonomic desk chairs.Jyllands-Posten 1955-10-19 In 1951, production consisted of the following categories: barber inventory, ship equipment and office furniture.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. History The City of Manistee was founded in 1841 when John and Joseph Stronach established a sawmill within the present city limits of Manistee. The city almost immediately became a lumber boom town, with 200 people living there in 1852 and 1000 by 1861. In the 1860s, the city grew even further, with 300 buildings constructed in 1869 alone. Nearly all of these buildings were constructed of wood, and on October 8, 1871, a catastrophic fire destroyed most of the downtown and the surrounding industrial areas. The fire resulted in the subsequent re-construction of a newdowntown, with buildings predominately of high-quality brick in an Italianate style. In 1878, rock salt was discovered near the city, and the industry grew as the lumber industry declined. The result was that by 1900 Manistee was home to 22,700 people. However, as the century progressed, the city's population dropped to around 8000 people. In fact, only limited new construction was undertaken after the construction of the Manistee County Savings Bank in 1907. The lack of new construction, though, has also left a downtown area with a historic feel, with fiew demolitions or architectural alterations. Description The Manistee Commercial Historic District consists of buildings surrounding Manistee's two major cross streets, River Street and Maple Street. The district contains 91 structures, of which 85 of the buildings are commercial structures, with three residences, four public buildings, and two fraternal lodges. Twenty of the buildings are not historically contributing. The contributing buildings are primarily brick Victorian commercial buildings constructed between 1870 and 1910. Significant buildings in the district include: *Dunham House (1878) The original portion of the Dunham House, built in 1878, was a three-story-high hotel containing 40 hotel rooms. In 1883, the hotel doubled in size, and is now approximately 160 feet by 120 feet. It is an Italianate structure with five bays along the main facade. *Ramsdell Theatre (1903) The Ramsdell Theatre and associated hall are built of deep red brick. The front entrance is through a formal a Doric portico, with a front facade topped with a boxed pedimented cornice. *Vogue Theatre (1938) The Vogue Theatre exterior has strong horizontal and vertical lines, presenting a dramatic contrast to the surrounding buildings. *Manistee County Savings Bank (1906–07) The Manistee County Savings Bank was designed by Albert E. Colcord of Chicago. It is a three-story building constructed of Bedford limestone. The facade is divided in half at the first floor, with one half containing two stores, and the other half containing the main banking room. Offices were on the second floor, and the third floor house a Knights of Pythias Lodge. *Ramsdell Building' (1891) The Ramsdell Building is a four-story Richardsonian Romanesque structure with a unique corner turret. *Haley Block (1883) The Haley Block is a two-story brick building, measuring about sixty feet in width, is divided into three storefront bays. *Pacific House (1880–87) Joseph Baur built two stores at this location in 1880. He soon added three more, then a second story level spanning the entire block, which opened as a hotel in 1884. The hotel was located near the newly opened Flint and Pere Marquette Railroad passenger station, and business was good enough that Bauer expanded his hotel in 1887. The building was then 120 feet by 120 feet *Winkler Block (1894–95) This masonry building is approximately 75 feet wide, consisting of three bays. The most distinctive architectural feature of the building is the corner turret. The turret is made of sheet metal and has the turret has five faces, each with a double-hung window, and is capped with a bell-shaped hip roof.

It uses historical data to expose trends and identify upcoming major shifts in a subject area, helping the analyst provide evidence-based forecasts with reduced cognitive bias. History Structured analytic techniques such as indicator analysis have been used by analysts the United States Intelligence Community (IC) for several decades, but usually only in the context of specialized subject areas. Since the World Trade Tower attacks on September 11, 2001 these techniques become more commonly used among analysts on more mainstream assignments as well, and throughout the IC. The National Commission on Terrorist Acts Upon the United States, or the 9/11 Commission that followed that event found that the IC had \\"a failure to challenge analytic mindsets, examine key assumptions, consider alternative hypotheses, and detect deceptive reporting,\\" on the part of the IC, leading directly to the 9/11 attacks. In response, President George W. Bush restructured the IC from the outside with the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA), while internally agencies began reforming their methodology, using more specialized structured analytic techniques like indicator analysis to more reliably correct cognitive bias in the future. Elements of indicator analysis =Structured analytic techniques= Indicator analysis is a structured analytic technique. Structured analytic techniques are used by intelligence analysts to help remove cognitive bias, challenge intuitive judgements, and help create a clearly traceable argument to support analytic conclusions. =Requirement= The main question under scrutiny. The requirement is often determined by the needs of a particular decision-maker, and defines the scope of the problem. =Categories= These are the various aspects of the requirement that merit individual scrutiny in order to understand the entirely of a problem. For instance, if the requirement is to ascertain the stability of a particular country, an analyst would need to look at the categories of politics, economics, social considerations, and possibly several others to gain a clear understanding of the situation in that country. =Factors= Factors are sub-sets of a category. For instance, to understand the political situation in a country, an analyst would need to look at the presence of political unrest, levels of corruption, the national government's relationship with the military, and possibly several others. =Scenarios= A scenario is a customized estimate of possible specific outcomes that could result from a category improving or destabilizing. Usually these scenarios are based on the current events of the factors involved in that category. =Indicators= Indicators indicates the change of sign when the reaction is complete. Indicators can be single events or actions within a factor that signify a major shift, affecting conditions in the rest of the categories or other categories. Indicators can also be a combination of events that serve a similar function in conjunction with each other. Much of indicator analysis is looking for the specific indicators that will signal a coming upheaval, but tracking how factors change over time can result in very useful trend analysis as well that is still considered a part of indicator analysis as a practice. An example of indicator analysis for stability in Albania, with three categories of factors listed Process # - Identify a set of categories relevant to the requirement # - Identify a set of factors relevant to each category in the context of the overall requirement # - Identify near-term scenarios that could result from immediate devolving or improvement in each factor # - Identify a series of events, or indicators, that could signify improvement or deterioration within each factor # - Review historical and ongoing events for indicators within each factor # - Identify single indicators and indicator trends to forecast which near-term scenario is most likely to occur.https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of- intelligence/csi-publications/books-and-monographs/Tradecraft%20Primer- apr09.pdf According to Randolph Pherson, a good indicator should be \\"Observable and Collectible, Valid, Reliable, Stable, and Unique\\" in order to find the key drivers of change in a given scenario. However, until the U.S. Intelligence Community standardizes its indicator lists, either within an agency or across the community, indicator choices will be subjective and possibly open to misunderstanding of terminology or scope if the analysis is later exposed to a broader audience than the originating task force. Benefits * Helps avoid cognitive biases like anchoring or confirmation bias * Helps keep analysts objective by using a pre-set list of criteria * Helps organize complex problems by breaking up requirements into more manageable subject areas * Allows analysts to detect gradual changes more easily * Allows for greater transparency in reaching analytic judgments Weaknesses * Based on a series of subjective judgments * Can be very time- consuming and cumbersome for emergency reportinghttp://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_reports/RR1400/RR1408/RAND_RR1408.pdf * Based on historical analysis that may not be relevant to future developments in non-linear issues Related Structured Analytic Techniques * Structured Brainstorming like Nominal Group Technique * Analysis of Competing Hypotheses * Key Assumptions Check * Customer Checklist * Premortem Analysis  References  Category:Intelligence analysis ","title":"Indicator analysis"},{"id":"53965957","text":"Michael Roy Sinker (called Roy; 28 September 19088 March 1994) was Archdeacon of StowHackthorn history from 1963Ecclesiastical News.

Sarasara subsequently released her debut studio album, Amor Fati in November 2016 to critical acclaim, being featured in The Guardian's Future 50 rising music stars to look out for,The Guardian - Future 50 Rising music stars to look out for Clash (magazine),Clash Magazine - Epic new cut Rolling Stone Rolling Stone - I tormenti sensuali di Sarasara and Tsugi.Tsugi - Superbe découverte occulte Her work has been likened to Björk, Kelela, Aaliyah and Aphex Twin, drawing on various genres including electronic music, trip hop, R&B;, industrial and avant-garde.  Life and career  =Early Life and career beginnings= Sarah was born in Fourmies, Nord. Her mother had emigrated to Paris from Morocco aged 16 following the death of her parents. Initially finding work as a cleaner, she later became the owner of a fish shop. Sarah's father, was a marketing manager for the French Wine Cabinet maker, EuroCave. The couple met in Paris in 1980 whilst Sarah's father was serving in the army. They fell in love, married, moved to the North of France and had Sarah, their only child. Tragically, Sarah's parents died in a car crash in Eppe-Sauvage when she was just 14 years-old. Sarah went to live with her Grandmother, herself a mother of 15 children. Sarah's Grandfather died of cancer in 2003. Just one year later, during a holiday in Madrid, her Grandmother also passed – suffering severe shock following the 2004 Madrid train bombings. Sarah returned to her parents’ house to live as an \\"emancipated minor\\". The successive tragedies she had experienced led her to rethink her career. Having formerly planned for a career in astrophysics, Sarah decided instead to pursue a career in business in the hope of becoming financially self-sufficient. She enrolled at the University of Valenciennes to study International Business Transactions and received a master's degree in Business Management from Institut supérieur européen de gestion group. Following her graduation, Sarah started work as a Business Unit Manager at an IT firm in Lille, specialising in mobile applications. Artistically, Sarah's career in music was not predetermined. Although she studied music and piano as a child – going on to study operatic singing as a teenager, following encouragement from her literature teacher – it was not until 2014 that she truly began to pursue her passion for music. Meanwhile, Sarah's musical tastes were profoundly influenced by the electronic music scene. Entering a night club for the first time in Belgium at the age of 15, she has described the experience as a \\"revelation\\". She quickly found herself frequenting clubs every single weekend, drawing inspiration from the sense of community and joy that came from sharing music. She fell in love with La Bush, one of Belgium's most famous clubs, and would frequently make the 4-hour round trip from the north of France to visit. Her passion for the electronic music scene encouraged her to build her very first studio in her parent's former bedroom, and to purchase her first Technics turntables and records. Sarah started DJing in local clubs, and very quickly found herself producing techno music for her friends using programmed beats and vocal samples. In 2015, she self-released a cover of David Bowie's ‘Heroes’.The 405 - Sarasara reworks David Bowie's classic 'Heroes' Receiving unprecedented success, the popularity of the release gave her the encouragement to begin to write and program her own songs. Later that year she reached out to British electronic musician, Matthew Herbert, with a set of self-produced demos. Taken by her unique talent, Herbert agreed to collaborate with Sarah on the production of her first extended play. Having long been influenced and inspired by Björk, Sarah sent the EP to her record label, One Little Indian. In January 2016, One Little Indian's Managing Director, Derek Birkett, signed Sarasara to the label. = 2016-2018: Amor Fati = Sarasara for The GuardianThe Guardian - New Band of the Week Sarasara's debut studio album, Amor Fati, was released on 11 November 2016. The title was inspired by Nietzsche's philosophy, and in particular, his philosophical novel: Thus Spoke Zarathustra. Amor Fati can be translated as “love of fate” or “love of one’s fate”. To Sarah, Amor Fati represents going beyond simply accepting one's fate. It is about wanting to make one's own fate - reaching for it, attracting it. In an interview for The 405,The 405 - Things You Should Know About My New Album the singer explained that, \\"in order to change one’s fate, one has to work instinctively – finding the willpower in their consciousness by listening to their body\\". The debut album featured four singles: EuphoriaAu féminin - Coup de coeur : On adore l'univers witch pop et décalé de Sarasara dans le clip \\"Euphoria\\" !, SupernovaWonderland Magazine - Supernova premiere Sarasara dances in the dawn light in \\"Supernova\\", SunCircuit Sweet- BRAND NEW VIDEO FOR ‘SUN’ and Love, and was met with significant critical acclaim. The Guardian profiled Sarasara for their \\"New Band of the Week\\"The Guardian - New band of the week feature, describing her as “... All cute breathy vocal-sighs and crashing dissonance, her music is what might have happened had Petite Meller signed to 90s Warp, or the next (il)logical step after the likes of FKA twigs, Kelela and SZA: a sort of industrial- Strength R&B; Aaliyah meets Aphex Twin”. She was subsequently featured as one of The Guardian's Future 50 Rising Stars, and the album received a rating of 8/10 from Clash (magazine).Clash Magazine - Thrilling future funk riddled with a sense of mysterious terror... The release of the Amor Fati was accompanied by an international tour, featuring shows in Paris, London, Copenhagen, Amsterdam, Los Angeles, New York, and music industry festivals such as The Great Escape Festival, Printemps de Bourges, MaMa Paris and South by South West (including the SXSW Hackathon) in Austin . Imagery Amor Fati artwork Sarah worked closely in the digital imagery for Amor Fati. Her cinematic ambitions have been shaped by artists such as David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, Maya Daren, Alfred Hitchcock, Quentin Tarantino, and Robert Rodriguez. The album's artwork was produced in collaboration with British photographer and artist Alva Bernadine, drawing inspiration from his series ‘Succubus’.Succubus by Alva Bernadine Sarah's passion and love of antique sculptures drew her to Alva – renowned for his background in fashion and the playfulness with which his work portrays the female body. The video for Euphoria emerged in collaboration with Israeli film animator Leopold Amitay. The video features a 2D animation based on Sarah's face and illustrative of her character. It was inspired by photographer Richard Avedon's famous portrait of Audrey Hepburn and the popular Greek mythological creature, Medusa. The video for Sun was shot in collaboration with Belgium filmmaker Gust Van den Berghe (Little Baby Jesus of Flandr, Blue Bird, LuciferVariety - Lucifer review) on a prototype camera called a Tondoscope.IndiWire- Tribeca: How the Filmmaker Behind ‘Lucifer’ Shot the First ‘Circular’ Feature Film The camera was invented by Gust for his film \\"Lucifer\\", and incorporates the lens within a glass tube so as to capture images in 360 degree, producing a circular canvas. The video for Love was directed, shot and edited by Sarasara in collaboration with British filmmaker Nikolai Galitzine YurievitchlMDb - Biography (Iris, Dear Child, From the Mountain). Further releases Sarasara performing at Palais des Beaux Arts Lille France Exactly one year after her release of Amor Fati, Sarasara released Amor Fati, the a cappella album, a recomposition of the album in collaboration with French vocal performers. Recorded in the Sculpture Chamber of Palais des Beaux-Arts de Lille, the album includes multiple influences such as Gospel, Soul, Rap, Opera and Beatbox. Amor Fati was further released as a Remixes EP, featuring remixes from Matthew Herbert, Susso, Crewdson and Earth is Flat. A deluxe version was released in March 2018. = 2019 – 2020: Orgone = Following the success of her debut studio release, Sarasara released her much anticipated second album, Orgone with One Little Indian Records on July 5, 2019. Produced in collaboration with Sneaker Pimps label-mate Liam Howe, Orgone is Sarah's first album in French, her mother tongue. The album features four singles: Blood Brothers, Into Me See, Ego Trip and Tinkertoy feat. Peter Doherty. It has been met with widespread critical acclaim across the globe, being featured in Marie Claire Magazine, NME, Rolling Stone and New York Times Magazine. Orgone reflects Sarasara's growth as an artist. Taking three years to complete, it is an intimately personal record that tells the story of her whirlwind entrance into the music industry. It is the story of her being tossed around – between two cycles, two careers, two homes and two countries. It is the story of the process of rebuilding after the end of karmic relationships and of falling in love again. It is the story of finding her way on a spiritual path, connecting with God, and learning the virtues of vulnerability, self-love, acceptance, surrendering to what is and being true to oneself. It is her taking responsibility for what she is putting into the universe, reclaiming her creative power, and, ultimately, becoming a better version of herself. The album toured globally, with dates across the US, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Belgium and the UK. Orgone was further released as a Remixes EP, featuring remixes from Liam Howe, Howie B, Hannah Peel, Mololoc, Michael Forzza and Dimitri Andreas.  Artistry  =Music influences and style= Sarah's musical influences and aspirations centre around powerful and iconic women in the music industry. Artists such as Björk, Madonna, Lady Gaga and Vanessa Paradis have been particularly inspiring. Sarah's music draws on a variety of styles, including electronic music, R&B;, trip hop, industrial and avant-garde. Her work has been compared to the work of Björk, as well as Aphex Twin, Kelela and Aaliyah. Sarasara's music makes use of her childhood classical signing training, and her literature teacher's advice that she had potential to become a Soprano singer. But it is also influenced by her incredibly eclectic musical tastes, growing up listening to everything from Techno to Classical music. Some of her favourite artists include for Electronic: Laurent Garnier, Richie Hawtin, Ricardo Villalobos - Detroit techno: Derrick May, Kevin Saunderson, Jeff Mills , Juan Atkins - Delta Blues Gospel: Lead Belly, Nina Simone, Jeff Buckley, Janis Joplin - French popular: Jacques Brel, Serge Gainsbourg, Vanessa Paradis, Georges Brassens - French and American Hip Hop and Rap - IAM, MC Solaar, Sayan Supa Crew, Wu Tang Clan, Cypress Hill. The result is a style that has been defined as “... robotic: pitting African instruments against squelching, mutant machine beats”. The MetropolistThe Metropolist - Five stars has likewise described her as “... an artist to watch closely – a young woman who uses technology to document and portray the agonies and dichotomies of modern-day existence ”. =Philosophy and spirituality= Sarah herself admits that her philosophy and spirituality are an intricately important part of her artistry, and is what lead her to music in the first place. Sarah's taste for philosophy and questioning of life came as a result of her premature confrontation with death. She studied philosophy at Evening School whilst working as a Business Unit Manager for an IT firm in Lille. She went on to complete a master's degree in the History of Hedonism from pre-Socratic to the present day, and found herself particularly drawn to the philosophical movements of Atomism, Stoicism, Epicureanism and Vitalism, Utilitarianism, Naturalism. Her philosophical influences include: Lucretius, Marcus Aurelius, Epicurus, Michel de Montaigne, Soren Kierkegaard, Jeremy Bentham, Voltaire, Nietzsche, Thoreau, Hannah Arendt, Jung, Wilhelm Reich. More recently, Sarah's engagement with such philosophers has drawn her to ancient eastern philosophy, most importantly Hinduism, Mysticism and Kriya Yoga. Sarah has referred to Yogananda Paramahansa's Autobiography of a Yogi as \\"a life changing book\\", and has been profoundly influenced by the spiritual masters Swami Kriyananda, Nayaswami Asha, Sadhguru. Sarah's practice of Kriya Yoga, and her journey on a new spiritual path continue to influence and enhance her music.

Aims Best for Britain is fighting to keep the UK open to EU membership. On its web site it states that it is committed to a democratic way to stop Brexit, with a final say by parliament and then the people; believes that young people should steer Britain into the future; believes that Britain and Europe's success are linked and wants what's best for Britain, not best for politicians or their political parties. Establishment Best for Britain was set up in April 2017 to work alongside other organisations in the campaign to maintain Britain's membership of the EU. It is avowedly apolitical and is led by business and charity sector figures. At the end of 2017, the former UN diplomat Lord Malloch-Brown became Best for Britain's Chair. The CEO is Naomi Smith. Campaign activities = Tell the Remain parties to work together = Following the 2019 European elections Best for Britain launched a campaign and petition that called for the leaders of political parties that supported remaining in the EU to work together to achieve that goal. = Voter registration campaign for European elections = Most recently, on 8 May 2019, Best for Britain launched a national campaign urging the 7.9 million unregistered eligible voters to sign up before the European elections. Best for Britain CEO, Naomi Smith called the figures “staggering” and said: “These people have a big part to play in the future direction of our country, and we will do everything in our power to ensure their voice is heard on polling day with everyone else's.” Best for Britain also created a tool to help voters register and/or obtain a postal vote. = Letters campaign = In the first part of 2019, Best for Britain provided support for a nationwide ‘Letters to the Editors’ campaign. This drew upon industry professionals from different sectors, such as midwives and doctors, who signed open letters for local and national publications. These highlighted their concerns about what they saw as the damage being done by Brexit to their fields in particular to the NHS. =People's Vote collaboration = Best for Britain has partnered with the People's Vote campaign on marches and rallies. On 23 June 2018 Best for Britain supported and participated in the People's Vote march in London to mark the second anniversary of the referendum to leave the European Union. and also supported and participated in the marches in October 2018 and in March and October 2019. The two organisations also held join rallies for supporters in Westminster Central Hall on 23 November 2018 and the Excel Centre on 9 December 2018. = Bringing Britain Back Together Again = In June 2018, Best for Britain launched its manifesto \\"Bringing Britain Back Together\\" to improve public understanding of the process to another referendum, emphasising the \\"it's still possible to stay\\" message and drawing attention to what it says was the government's delay and confusion over Brexit. It included an open letter to the country and a road map to stopping Brexit, calling for both sides of the Brexit debate to embrace the idea of another vote to settle the question of the UK's membership of the EU and to avoid the risk that \\"the entire establishment sleepwalks the country over the Brexit finish line in March 2019\\". Best for Britain coupled this manifesto launch with the stated intention to campaign in around 70 key marginal seats, trying to persuade both Labour and Conservative MPs to support a second referendum. = When will we know what we voted for? advertising campaign = Between March and June 2018, Best for Britain ran an advertising campaign across the UK. It featured citizens asking: \\"When will we know what we voted for?\\" The campaign slogan, displayed on billboards and in newspaper ads in Birmingham, Carlisle, Manchester, Liverpool, London and Stoke was: \\"We all deserve a final say on the Brexit deal.\\" Best for Britain was reported to have spent £500,000 on this campaign. = Tactical voting campaign = In April and May 2017, Best for Britain ran what it claimed was the UK's largest ever tactical voting campaign. On 19 April 2017 it launched a crowdfunding appeal in an immediate response to Theresa May's announcement of a snap election to be held on 8 June 2017. The crowdfunding campaign received donations from more than 10,000 people and raised over £350,000. The tactical vote campaign was launched at a press conference on 26 April 2017 by co-founder Gina Miller and then CEO Eloise Todd. Miller said: \\"We need to prevent MPs and the people being forced into an extreme Brexit that is not in Britain's best interests. ... We will support candidates who campaign for a real final vote on Brexit, including rejecting any deal that leaves Britain worse off.\\" Miller was the chief spokesperson for this campaign. Miller left Best for Britain after the 2017 general election, expressing concern that the group had become more anti-Tory than Brexit-focused and described it as \\"a room full of white males deciding what's going to happen to the country\\" and as \\"undemocratic\\". In 2019, the campaign launched a tactical voting tool for the 2019 general election. The tool attracted immediate controversy after claims that its source data lacked transparency, and recommended that voters vote for the Liberal Democrats in seats that that party had never won and where it had polled well behind the main opposition Labour Party in the previous election. Funding In February 2018, it was reported in The Daily Telegraph, and confirmed by Best for Britain, that George Soros, through his foundations, had contributed £400,000 to the campaign. The Telegraph’s report was described as an \\"antisemitic dogwhistle\\" and also criticised for calling Best for Britain’s public aim to stop Brexit a \\"secret plot\\". In response Best for Britain launched a crowdfunder, which raised over £200,000 and led to Soros donating a further £100,000. Best for Britain says it raises much of its funding through smaller individual donations and crowdfunding exercises.

On May 9, 2017, Delaware House members voted to reinstate the death penalty citing Ballard's murder as one of the motivating reasons. However, the bill failed to get a committee hearing in the state Senate. In May 2019, Smyk introduced a similar bill.

The 9/11 terrorist attacks drove this directive forward as there was a call for many intelligence disciplines to work collectively on assessing and predicting threats to the United States. Intelligence Community Directive 301 outlined responsibilities and established policies on the intelligence community regarding open source intelligence activities.  Background  Intelligence Community Directive 301 (ICD-301) took effect on July 11, 2006 when it was signed by the first Director of National Intelligence, John Negroponte, under the Bush Administration. The directive outlines the responsibilities for oversight and management needed for the implementation of open-source intelligence activities within the intelligence community. The goal of ICD-301 was to establish priority of open source information as the intelligence community's first consulted source type, or \\"source of first resort\\". Following the 9/11 terrorist attacks there was a call for the intelligence community to utilize many different disciplines of intelligence collectively to better assess and predict threats to the United States. ICD-301 outlined responsibilities of the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source, the Open Source Committee,The Open Source Advisors Board, the Director of National Intelligence Open Source Center (now the Open Source Enterprise) and the remainder of the intelligence community. These entities are held responsible for open source activities to be conducted in a way that is both effective and efficient. This directive repealed the Director of Central Intelligence Directive 1/7 intelligence community open source program set in place on September 26, 2000. ICD-301 was ultimately rescinded in 2012, it was thought that ICD 113 provided ample guidelines for responsibility and oversight needed for open source activities. ICD 301 was the second directive in the 300 series, which addressed methods of collection. Among this series are; ICD-300 concerning management of intelligence collection and covert action this ICD prefaced ICD-301 being signed in 2006. ICD-302 concerning media exploitation was signed in 2007 and ICD-304 on human intelligence collection signed into action in 2009 were the two ICD's that followed ICD-301. ICD-310 and ICD 311 dealt with human based foreign intelligence collection and counter intelligence within and from outside the United States respectively.  Policies  ICD-301 established two main policies: 1)The Director of National Intelligence sought to further emphasize the use of open source information and analysis, through a more structured and fluid information sharing system among all intelligence community members. 2) Policies within the intelligence community: * Centralize strategy, oversight and evaluation under the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source. * Responsibility to share information to the maximum extent possible among intelligence community, public/ private sector, other United States Government agencies, and foreign partners. * Sharing open source collection and exploitation tools or capabilities to the fullest extent, to be validated by the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source and to be potentially standardized by the intelligence community. * Open source intelligence will support all other types of intelligence gathering and exploitation efforts. * Open source exploiters and analysts will follow proper information security protocol set by the Director of National Intelligence. * All open source exploiters will validate and verify their information sources appropriately set by the Director of National Intelligence. * Feedback processes will be coordinated with the Assistant Deputy Director of National Intelligence for Open Source to evaluate return on investment, customer satisfaction, and inform strategy on resource decision making.

The film won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film at the 64th National Film Awards. It became the fifth Marathi film to win in this category.  Plot  Maanav (Alok Rajwade) has been hospitalized for cutting his wrists. He runs away from the hospital. Janaki (Iravati Harshe) finds him collapsed on the side of the road. She asks her driver Yadu (Kishor Kadam) to take him home to Devgad(konkan) and appoints a private doctor. Janaki is a divorcee who often consults a psychologist for her panic attacks. She also helps Dattabhau (Mohan Agashe), who is working on an olive ridley sea turtles conservation program.  Cast  * Iravati Harshe as Janaki * Alok Rajwade as Maanav * Mohan Agashe as Dattabhau * Kishor Kadam as Yadu  Production  Mohan Agashe had acted and co-produced filmmaker duo Sumitra Bhave–Sunil Sukthankar's earlier film Astu (2016). A New Jersey-based couple, Prakash and Alka Lothe, saw Astu and liked it and gave 50 lakh to its producer-directors to make another film based on mental disorders. Bhave–Sukthankar found it difficult to find producers to make Kaasav which is based on depression as its theme. Agashe produced the film with Bhave and Sukthankar. The film was shot in a single 18-day schedule at Devgad's beaches. As it depicts the issue of depression among youngsters in relation to the life and nesting cycle of olive ridley sea turtles, the team did a lot of research on the endangered species. Agashe, himself being a psychiatrist, provided clinical material to the filmmakers that also included psychiatrist and researcher Vikram Patel's book, \\"Where There is No Psychiatrist: A Mental Health Care Manual\\".  Reception and awards  The film won the Golden Lotus Award (Swarna Kamal) National Film Award for Best Feature Film at the 64th National Film Awards.

Lingnan architecture (), or Cantonese architecture, refers to the characteristic architectural style(s) of the Lingnan region – the Southern Chinese provinces of Guangdong and Guangxi. Usually, it is referring to the architecture associated with the Cantonese people, with other peoples in the area (such as the Hakka and the Teochew) having their own styles.淺談嶺南民居的嶺南建築特色Hao, X. I. E. (2010). Possibility of Lingnan Architectural Design [J]. Interior Design, 1, 014. This style began with the architecture of the ancient non-Han Nanyue people and absorbed certain architectural elements from the Tang Empire and Song Empire as the region sinicized in the later half of the first millennium AD. Introduction Modern day's Lingnan architecture is distinct from its counterparts in other Han Chinese regions because Cantonese people adapt their architecture to the geography of the region: the region has a subtropical climate, very unlike China's central plain (Zhongyuan). The set of building materials Cantonese have had access to also differs from that of other Han Chinese groups due to, for instance, difference in the tree species available. Overall, the classical Lingnan style, which is the best-known of Lingnan architecture, tends to favor pale colors such as green and white, avoid circular structures, adopt large numbers of relief carvings and sculptures, have many open structures like balconies and verandas, and be built using materials resistant to molds and moisture. The last two points are obviously related to the hot and humid subtropical climate of Lingnan.歐志圖, & 黃小華. (2003). 嶺南建築與民俗. 百花文藝出版社. Chen Clan Ancestral Hall in Guangzhou is seen as a representative example of classical Lingnan architecture. The temple was built in late 19th century and served as an academy for Chan families in 72 counties of the Guangdong province. It comprises all sorts of folk architectural and decorative arts, and is famous for its \\"three carvings\\" (stone, wood and brick carvings), \\"three sculptures\\" (ceramic sculpture, clay sculpture and colorful sculpture) and \\"one cast\\" (cast iron). As a result, it is called the best of all the clan temples in the neighborhood. Today, some elements of Lingnan architecture are adopted in the construction of commercial districts in Guangzhou, the capital city of Guangdong province. In commercial streets, old- fashioned shops of classical Lingnan architecture are found in heaps. Attached to the second story from the pavement, numerous pillars are built in front of the stores. Similar building styles are still relatively common in some areas of Hong Kong and Macau. Pre-sinicization: Nanyue architecture Currently, not much research has been done on the architectural style(s) of the Nanyue people, the original Baiyue inhabitants of Lingnan before the region sinicized. There are, however, several heritage sites from that period, giving clues to what Nanyue architecture might have been like.南越古國吹「西洋風」 The Mausoleum of the Nanyue King (), for instance, was built in about 120 BC and uncovered in 1983. It served as the tomb for Ziu Mo, the second king of the Nanyue kingdom. It has been noted that the architecture has several dissimilarities from its Zhongyuan counterpart from the same time period: The mausoleum used corridors with curved turns, crescent-shaped ponds, and steep walls on the west side and tilt walls on the east. The bottom of its waterways were paved with pebbles and gravel, resulting in the drainage water forming small whirlpools upon hitting the walls.廣州海絲遺迹行之二——南越國宮署遺址 =Examples of Nanyue architecture= File:Nanyue Sluice Model.jpgA model of the sluice of Nanyue; It is the oldest, largest, and most well-preserved example of sluice from that time period.时代最早规模大 广州南越国水闸遗址将首次亮相，中国新闻网 Tang architecture The siniciziation of Lingnan was prominent during the Tang dynasty (7th to 10th century),廣東唐人洋雜碎 which results in Lingnan culture (i.e., Cantonese culture) being strongly influenced by Tang culture and having preserved munch Tang heritage not preserved in other branches of modern Han Chinese culture. Between 4th to 10th century, many monks came from Zhongyuan to spread Buddhism in Lingnan, resulting in the construction of religious structure such as Guangxiao Temple () although no structure from the Tang Dynasty era exists anywhere in Lingnan today. Also, since the 19th century, the Tang style has seen a revival in the region, whether in Hong Kong and Macau or the mainland part of Lingnan. A prominent example is the Chi Lin Nunnery in Hong Kong. This style of architecture is very unlike classical Lingnan architecture: It is (1) primarily built with wood, rather than the green bricks typical of the classical Lingnan style; (2) tends to give a sense of grandness using upward- curving roofs and bright colors, in stark contrast to the rectangular and pale classical Lingnan style; and (3) has highly orderly arrangement of buildings. Buildings of this style bears much resemblance to the Buddhist temples in Kyoto, Japan, which are also heavily based on Tang architecture.南園蓮池/志蓮淨苑 仿照唐代藝術的古式園林與佛教廟宇～ =Modern reconstructed buildings in Lingnan in Tang style= File:Guangxisi Gulou.jpgModern day 20th century reconstructed Guangxiao Temple's buildings have upward-curving roofs. Classical Lingnan architecture As sinicization of Lingnan completed in Southern Song dynasty (10th to 13th century), the classical Lingnan style seen today slowly formed. The classical Lingnan style formed as early as 14th century and represents Cantonese people's adaptation of their hybrid culture (i.e., with elements of Nanyue, Tang, and Song) to the region's geography. Nowadays, it is widely considered a major Cantonese accomplishment and tourist attraction for Guangdong and eastern Guangxi.Guohua, T. (2005). Xia Changshi’s Sunshade” and Lingnan architecture heatproofness. New Architecture, 6, 006.Yang, H. J. T. W. (2003). Research on the Contemporary Lingnan Architecture Creation [J]. Journal of South China University of Technology (Natural Science), 7, 014. Commonly cited characteristics of the classical Lingnan style include: =Doors and directions= Classical Lingnan architecture pays much attention to the use of doors. This is partly due to the influence of a strong Feng shui culture: There is the traditional belief that having the main door face south means prosperity, which results in most classical Lingnan-style buildings (especially ancestral halls) facing south. Larger buildings also tend to have many types of doors, with \\"central doors\\" (Jyutping: Zung1 mun4; Traditional Chinese: 中門) only usable for high-status individuals (i.e., male leaders of the household, important guests, and women with male heirs) in older times, while other people could only use \\"side doors\\" (Jyutping: Zak1 mun4; Traditional Chinese: 側門). They also have a concept called \\"manner doors\\" (Jyutping: Ji4 mun4; Traditional Chinese: 儀門), which means that there is a second door behind the main door. Manner doors are especially common in ancestral halls, where ancestors are worshiped, due to the traditional belief that one should not go straight at (which has connotations such as \\"to conflict with\\") one's ancestors upon entering the hall. =Narrow doors= Narrow door (Jyutping: Aai3 mun4; Traditional Chinese: 隘門) is an architectural feature common in the classical Lingnan style, referring to a sudden narrowing of the walkway at the end of a corridor or alley.林會承. (1985). 清末鹿港街鎮結構。臺北市：境與象出版社。 These narrow doors have been built to separate alleys from each other and set at tactically crucial points. They are traditionally open in daytime, and closed after sunset unless in case of emergency. They are used to form \\"defensive circles\\", in each of which a number (ranging from 2 to 50) of households help look out for one another. This feature arose to serve defensive purposes against bandits, pirates, and other clans. =Cold alleys= A cold alley. Cold alleys (Jyutping: Laang5 hong2; Traditional Chinese: 冷巷, literally \\"cold alley\\") has been called the \\"essence\\" of classical Lingnan architecture, and is utilized in the region outside the classical style.冷巷被稱嶺南民居精髓 擔負通風排水多種功能 The cold alley is a narrow path walled on both sides by buildings, like a corridor within the complex. The narrowness of a cold alley results in an increase in wind speed within, which in turn causes the hot air in the rooms connected to the cold alley to be brought out more quickly while cool air enters, achieving good ventilation - a trait very useful in the subtropical Lingnan. Cold alleys can be divided into two types: indoor and outdoor. When used indoor, a cold alley rarely receives sunshine. When used outdoor, a cold alley (called \\"blue cloud alley\\" in this case) receives relatively little sunshine due to being shadowed by the tall buildings that wall it from both sides. Either way, this results in even better cooling effect. =Carvings and sculptures= Cantonese people have been known for being prolific craftsmen and merchants. The region historically exported a large number of sculptures and other craft products. The classical Lingnan style goes along with this: It traditionally uses very large amount of relief carvings and sculptures for the purpose of decorations (especially in temples and ancestral halls). The carvings and sculptures in question could be made from wood, bricks, stones, and so on. They are usually uncolored, but some are decorated with garish colors. The subject matters of these carvings and sculptures generally revolve around figures and scenes from Chinese mythology and Cantonese folktales. =Lingnan guardian lions= Chinese architecture in general uses guardian lions. However, it has been noted that Southern China has a style different from Northern China.李芝崗. (2003). 中華石獅雕刻藝術. 天津市：百花文藝出版社。 Southern Chinese guardian lions are used in Lingnan, Fujian, and Taiwan. They are noted for having large heads and small legs, protruding skulls and flat noses, leaf-shaped ears, mouths set in roaring configurations, and sharp teeth. Lingnan guardian lions tend to be more elongated and have more varied poses. The male guardian lions are generally on the left side of the door and stepping on embroidered balls - which is considered to symbolize good luck. =Other characteristics= \\"Three rooms and two corridors\\" (Jyutping: Saam1 gaan1 loeng5 long4; Traditional Chinese: 三間兩廊) is a typical layout found in classical Lingnan residential architecture, with Tai Fu Tai Mansion being a good example. Also, in classical Lingnan residence, indoor windows are usually small and high on the walls, for the purpose of defense against bandits. These windows, however, are poor at lighting up the rooms and thus often accompanied by skylights or other structures that involve opening on the ceilings. =Green brick= Green brick is a popular building material in the Lingnan region. It is well known for being resistant to changes in temperature and moisture - which makes it very useful for building in the hot and humid Lingnan region. =Gallery= File:Canton 1996 307.jpgRelief carvings are very prevalent in the classical Lingnan style. File:Guangzhou Huanghuagang 2013.12.15 14-13-16.jpgThe guardian lion at Wong Fa Gong Park, Guangzhou, has quite an elongated body. Wok yi uk Wok yi uk (Jyutping: Wok6 ji5 uk1; Traditional Chinese: 鑊耳屋, literally \\"house with wok ears\\") is a distinct characteristic in Lingnan architecture.嶺南建築之鍋耳屋 It is a building that has a pair of curved walls protruding vertically at both ends of its roof, usually seen in traditional residential buildings. It emerged at around 15th century, during which Lingnan was ruled by the Ming Empire. It was a tradition to build such walls for people who have been granted honors through the empire's examination system. This later evolved into the belief that building such walls could help one's sons and grandsons attain similar honors. It also has more practical purposes, however - having the two walls protruding from both ends of the roof could help reduce the amount of sunlight directly shining on the roof, resulting in lowered temperature. This is useful in the subtropical Lingnan region. =Wok yi uks in Lingnan= File:Minister Hall in Canton.JPGA row of wok yi uks in Fadou District, Guangzhou: Each house has a pair of curved walls protruding vertically at both ends of its roof. Oyster shell house An oyster shell house. Oyster shell house (Jyutping: Hou3 hok3 uk1; Traditional Chinese: 蠔殼屋) is an architectural style that arose in Lingnan in late 16th to early 17th century. It arose when certain Cantonese villages started gathering oyster shells from nearby coasts to build homes. It is said that the use of oyster shells helps the building become more resistant to wild changes in temperature, accumulation of rainwater, and insect infestation. There used to be hundreds of such houses dispersed across Guangdong, but now most have been demolished. Only four of them remain. At present, the Hoizyu district has developed a plan to protect and maintain the remaining oyster shell house.番禺蚝壳屋 This style is viewed as an indication of the strong \\"ocean culture\\" elements in Cantonese culture. Tong lau Tong lau (Jyutping: Tong4 lau4; Traditional Chinese: 唐樓) is a style of tenement buildings architecture found in Lingnan (and also in some other areas by the South China Sea) starting from 19th century. It is essentially a balcony-type, multi-story tenement building for residential and commercial use, with each story being three to four meters tall, typically built with either green bricks or, later, concrete. The main purpose of tong lau is to let people live upstairs while running some sorts of business (e.g., a pawn shop) downstairs. It has been influenced by European architecture, and arose due to Lingnan's extensive commercial exchanges with Western Europeans since 15th century. This style is thus especially prevalent in regions with more exposure to Western European cultures, such as Hong Kong and Macau. Tong laus are strongly associated with Hong Kong and frequently appear in the city's movies and soap operas. =Tong laus in Lingnan= File:European Style Street.jpgA row of tong laus in Hoiping, Guangdong. Lingnan garden The pond of Yuyum Sanfong. Lingnan garden (Jyutping: Ling5 naam5 jyun4 lam4; Traditional Chinese: 嶺南園林), or Cantonese garden, is the style of garden design native to the Lingnan region. Geographically, Lingnan has very different climate from China's heartland (i.e., Zhongyuan), resulting in her developing a different style in designing gardens. The most frequently cited traits of Lingnan gardens are: (1) they tend to surround their plants with buildings to provide protection to the plants, due to the frequent rainfalls and storms in the region; (2) Lingnan gardens usually use plant species native to the region, such as red cotton flowers and lychee trees; (3) due to Lingnan being far away from the center of power (i.e., Zhongyuan), gardens in the region have historically been less bounded by royal standards, resulting in a style that leans more towards the common people, e.g., Lingnan gardens are decorated with large amount of handcraft products of local people, ranging from sculptures to porcelains, and also tend to use smaller buildings; (4) as in the case with classical Lingnan architecture, with Cantonese being prolific craftsmen, Lingnan gardens tend to use a large number of relief carvings and sculptures. Built in early 20th century, Bou Mak Garden (Jyutping: Bou2 mak6 jyun4; Traditional Chinese: 寶墨園, literally \\"Garden of Treasure and Ink\\") is located in Punyu, Guangzhou, and is a fine example of classical Lingnan garden. Once inside, exotic buildings, gardens, hills, lakes, and bridges are found - a place that reveals interplay between nature's art and man-made art in forms of sculptures and edifices, which boast intricate clay, porcelain, brick, wood and stone carving. Other representative examples of Lingnan gardens would be the \\"four great gardens of central Canton\\": Yuyum Sanfong, Leung's Garden, Ching Fai Garden, and Ho Garden. =Lingnan gardens= File:佛山梁园.JPGLeung's Garden.

History The District Council of Willunga was established on 18 August 1853 to govern the Hundred of Willunga and southernmost portion of the Hundred of Kuitpo, one of the set of earliest local government bodies to be created in the state. The district was bounded on the north west by the Onkaparinga River up to the present-day boundary between Blewitt Springs and Clarendon. It was bounded on the north east by straight lines passing to the Wickam Hill and North Mount Magnificent trig stations. The ridge lines making up the southern borders of the hundreds of Kuitpo and Willunga formed the southern boundary of the district, passing through the South Mount Magnificent trig station, Willunga Hill and Sellicks Hill. The council area thus included all of the present-day McLaren Vale wine region and the forestry area known as Lower Meadows or Dingabledinga. By 1856, residents on the northern boundary at Noarlunga had seceded from the council along with parts of Morphett Vale council over the Onkaparinga River to form the District Council of Noarlunga. The following year, residents of Aldinga successfully lobbied for their own independent local governance and the coastal District Council of Aldinga was formed to the south. Upon completion of these boundary adjustments Willunga comprised three wards; namely Willunga, McLaren Vale and Lower Meadows. In 1932 Aldinga was dissolved and the land absorbed back into Willunga council. In 1997 the council was amalgamated with Noarlunga and Happy Valley councils to form the City of Onkaparinga.

Samuel K. Boateng was a ground-breaking case concerning copyright law in Ghana by the High Court of Justice. It reaffirmed the laws of Copyright relating to the requirements of copyright protection and also, the law relating to authorship in Ghana. This case elaborated the fact that the law of Copyright in Ghana is a creature of StatutePaul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng, (2012), p. 7 and setting out some major general principles in Copyright Law in Ghana. The facts involved Mr. Paul Oliver, a programmer, who claimed ownership of Copyright in two versions of a Rural Banking software called Rural Banker and E- finance respectively. Paul Oliver sued Samuel Boateng and the second defendant Victor Gbehodor for licensing his software to other rural banks without his permission. The court in this case, Fundamentally, relying heavily on Statute, which in this case was the Copyright Act, 2005 emphasized how statute dependent the Law of Copyright in Ghana is . The case also made reference to the various subject matter that are not Copyright-able in Ghana throwing a specific light on Ideas.it made it clear that a person who expresses the idea in a concrete form will rather be the Author of a work. Also, this case made some decisions regarding may be referred to as a joint Author and also threw some light on Infringement of Copyright, Damages and also highlighted the existence of idea/expression merger scenarios.  Facts  The plaintiff, Paul Oliver, worked for Ananse systems where he created the first two versions of a Banking software alongside an ex- Banker, Samuel K. Boateng who was also engaged with Ananse systems. The plaintiff went to the U.K and released the third version of the Banking software called The Rural Banker which was a comprehensive banking system and fully integrated into an accounting software he had also developed which was later succeeding by a 4th version called E- finance. The plaintiff met the 1st defendant again, who at that time had left Ananse systems to try market the new version of the banking software that he had created. The 1st defendant registered a business under the name BSL systems for that exact purpose. The parties subsequently fell out with each other and a dispute arose. The major part of departure and which was the fulcrum of the case was the authorship and ownership of the copyrights in the last two versions (4th and 3rd versions) of the banking software. The plaintiff contended that the agreement that existed between them entailed the 1st defendant would market the software and the 1st defendant will in turn, license the software to the banks. This was the same arrangement he had with Ananse systems. The plaintiff also claimed that he issued invoices to the defendants which the defendants sent him money as license fee in return and the defendants transferred the money because they acknowledged that he was the sole author. The Defendants countered by claiming that the plaintiff had never been the sole author of the rural banking software in its various versions and that the 1st defendant pleaded that even when he was engaged in Ananse systems, he was there, “ with a view of developing the rural Banking software” because he was a professional Banker with vast working experience .Therefore, it was his ideas which constituted he sub structure for the Banking Software created by the plaintiff and that the plaintiff contributed only to the software by designing the software at the direction of the 1st defendant and just provided the source and object codes for this software. The defendants therefore think that both the Rural Banker and E- finance were jointly authored by the plaintiff and the defendants after the formation of BSL systems, only sent the plaintiff money dubbed “licensing fee” because of Bank of Ghana regulations. They subsequently transferred the money because the plaintiff retained the activation codes of the software and used it as a bargaining chip to compel the first defendant to pay him balances after the deduction of overhead cost. The defendants continued to distribute the software without his permission after their relationship got terminated and the plaintiff's first head of claim was a demand for outstanding license fee for distribution of the software without consent and for infringement of copyright.  Judgement  The court ultimately held that the plaintiff was the sole author of the rural Banker and e-Finance software and that the defendant's use and licensing of these software without his permission following the termination of their partnership amounted to an infringement of the plaintiff's copyright. The Court again cited the copyright ActSection 5 of The Copyright Act of Ghana,2005 (Act 690) and emphasized the fact that the author of a work has exclusive right in respect of the work and that the copy right in that work should not be contested. The court granted the plaintiff money for unpaid bills and granted the plaintiffs damages for infringement and stated that the defendants should reinstate the plaintiff by disgorging all the income they enjoyed from licensing the plaintiff's software from the date of infringement.  Significance  = Who is an Author? = The case in its proceedings stated the definition of an author and highlighted who an Author was. Justice Gertrude Torkornoo stated, “it is the creator of copyrighted material who qualifies to be the and identified as an author with protected rightsPaul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng,(2012), p.10” = Joint Authorship = The case mentioned that copyright is only granted to the authors of a workPaul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng,(2012), p.7 and also gave the definition of joint Authorship as follows, “a work created by two or more Authors in collaboration, in which individual contributions are indistinguishable from each other” . This case therefore, sets the requirements of Joint Authorship in Ghana which include, independent contribution, Collaboration by authors claiming joint authorship and that their contributions should be indistinguishable. The court in this case, went on to say that in order to satisfy these requirements set in Section 77 of Act 690, a person claiming joint authorship should be able to again satisfy 3 proper questions.Paul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng,(2012), p.8 Firstly, did each claimant contribute directly to the creation of the work? Followed by, was there a mutual intention of two parties to joint Author the work? And finally, is their individual work so woven into a whole that the work would lack the current identity if one person's contribution is taken out? If all the questions can be answered positively, two parties can then successfully claim joint authorship. = Copyright and ideas = The case stated in it that one of the fundamental principles of copyright law in Ghana is that ideas, concepts, methods, procedures or things of similar nature cannot be copyrighted.Paul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng,(2012), p.17 This statement is reaffirmed in section 2 of the Copyrights ActSection 2 of The Copyright Act of Ghana,2005 ( Act 690) which states that, “Copyright shall not extend to ideas, concepts, procedures, methods or other things of a similar nature.” Thus, the statement of the 1st defendant that he jointly authored the software because he jointly provided the ideas used in creating it does not make him a joint author. Justice Gertrude Torkornoo then stated that, “the one who provides the idea does not walk in the same shoes as the one who expresses the idea” . These points emphasise the fact that it is the only the person who expresses an idea in a concrete form is entitled to copyright hence the judge's statement, “…no matter how brilliant the outline of ideas generated by anyone, it is not till those ideas are expressed in a particular concrete form that copyright law may be invoked, and it is only the person who expressed those ideas in the particular concrete form that is identified as the author of the expressionPaul Oliver v Samuel K. Boateng,(2012), p.14” = Originality = Originality was mentioned slightly in this case. This supported the provisions in Section 2 of the Copyright Act, 2005. In order for a work to enjoy copyright, the skill, labour and Judgement required for creating the copyrighted expression must be original and further asserts that the word “original”, does not mean new or novel but that the creative work must originate from the author. = Idea/expression Merger = The court referred to the case of Baker V Selden which saw the United States Supreme Court hold that in situations where an idea merges with its expression such that the idea can only be expressed in only one form and that the idea cannot be expressed in any other form but that form, the law will still not give copyright to the originator of the work. = Infringement = Infringement as seen in Section 41 of the Copyright ActSection 41 of The Copyright Act of Ghana,2005 (Act 690) is also elaborated in this case. Section 41 made it clear that nobody is permitted to perform acts contrary to the rights of an Author. The defendant in this case, by licensing the plaintiff's software to Rural Banks following the plaintiff's termination of his partnership with them without his permission amounted to acts contrary to the rights of the plaintiff and this therefore, constituted an infringement. This case therefore highlights a major way by which an author's copyright may be infringed. = Damages = Damages are normally awarded as compensation for an infringement of copyright. This above point was showcased in this case when Justice Gertrude Torkorno said that the court must consider damages after infringement had been found.Paul Oliver V Samuel K. Boateng, (2012), p. 42 The damages however, must be fair and reasonably when she again stated that, “the damages which the other party ought to receive in respect of such breach of contract should be such as may fairly and reasonably be considered as either arising naturally.” = Essence of Accounts = This case also supports the fact courts will usually order a defendant to submit his accounts to determine damages. Justice Gertrude Torkorno ordered Samuel K. Boateng to submit a list,” of all persons to whom they have licensed the plaintiff’s software Rural Banker and e-finance since April 2011 when plaintiff severed his relationship with them. They are further to file an account of monies received from every entity they have licensed the software to since April 2011 ”. This is done in case the sum gained by the defendant is higher than the damages awarded to the plaintiff. = Injunction = An injunction was placed on the defendants, their representatives, agents and assigns. They were perpetually restrained from dealing with, representing themselves as authors and or persons with authority to license, market or distribute the plaintiff's software. Injunctions serve as one of the civil remedies available to a copyright owner to protect his interests from further exploitation. This suit therefore exhibited the existence of injunctions as a way further protecting the economic rights of an author.

Jones\\" (sometimes \\"Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones\\"; originally titled \\"Man of the Year\\") is a 1938 satirical song written by Harold Rome. It was first recorded and released as a single by Ella Fitzgerald in 1938 and was performed by Judy Garland in blackface in the 1941 musical picture Babes on Broadway. The song satirizes the then contemporaneous practice of African American parents who named their children after Franklin D. Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States. The song was written by Rome for his and Charles Friedman's 1938 satirical musical revue Sing out the News, where it was introduced by Rex Ingram and chorus and bandleader Hazel Scott. The song was performed in the musical in the context of a block party in Harlem. Rome's biographer, Tighe E. Zimmers, described the song as \\"Rome at his tuneful, liberal best, celebrating the birth of a black baby while paying homage to Franklin D. Roosevelt.\\" It has also been described as \\"patronizing, if well- meant\\" by Guido van Rijn in his 1995 book Roosevelt's Blues: African-American Blues and Gospel Artists on President Franklin D. Roosevelt. The song was first recorded by Chick Webb and His Orchestra with vocalist Ella Fitzgerald and released by Decca Records as catalog number 2105, with the flip side \\"I Love Each Move You Make\\".Decca Records in the 2000 to 2499 series It was recorded by 16 other American and British vocalists within a year. Judy Garland released it as the B side to her 1941 single \\"How About You?\\" as Decca 4072. Other satirical songs in the musical included \\"I Married a Republican\\" and \\"My Heart is Unemployed\\". Rome later contributed the song \\"Little Miss Victory Jones\\" to Howard Dietz and Vernon Duke's 1942 satirical revue Dancing in the Streets, but it was not perceived as successful as \\"F.D.R. Jones\\" being described by writer Louis Kronenberger as \\"more a puniest sort of stepsister\\" rather than a cousin to \\"F.D.R. Jones\\". \\"F.D.R. Jones\\" subsequently won an award from the American American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) as one of the best songs of 1938. The song was extremely popular from its debut, and sold 70,000 sheet music copies. It was covered by Cab Calloway, Chick Webb, Glenn Miller, as well as Fitzgerald and Garland. In his 1994 book My Singing Teachers, singer Mel Tormé described Fitzgerald's version as one of his favourites that she recorded with the Chick Webb band and that she sang it with \\"great humor\\". The songs popularity endured until World War II, it was subsequently sung by soldiers waiting to be evacuated after the Battle of Dunkirk in 1940 and broadcast with altered lyrics by the Nazi propagandist band Charlie and his Orchestra in January 1942 as part of an anti-Semitic attack on Roosevelt. Garland's Babes On Broadway performance The song was performed as part of a minstrel medley by Judy Garland and Mickey Rooney in blackface in the 1941 musical film Babes on Broadway. The medley was subsequently described by Michael Feingold in a 1998 review of recent Garland reissues in the Village Voice as \\"otherwise unstomachable\\" apart from Garland's performance of the song which he felt was a \\"triumphant rendition...innocence joyously cubed and that \\"...she largely eschews the genre's racist mannerisms. It's just Judy, proud and happy, as a nonwhite male American, a role like other roles\\". Feingold concluded that \\"Distressing as the sequence is, Judy's spirit gets past it. She does not seem to be playing to the blackface, as Jolson does in similar numbers; what stays in the memory is her vocal clarity (the crane shot climbs over a single bell-toned long note), not the horrific racist cartoon. It's the ultimate indication of her power to transcend: There's very little uglier than this in American pop culture, yet even here Judy can find a reserve of dignity, and not be brought down. She does not \\"sell\\" racism; at her bosses' behest, she merely wears its costumes\\".

Although it was founded in the mid-17th century, it is now dominated by architecture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Center Cemetery is the town's oldest surviving property, and includes the grave of William Pitkin, a colonial governor. The district, including portions of Main Street and Central Avenue, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993. Description and history The town of East Hartford was settled not long after the first settlement by English colonists across the Connecticut River at Hartford in 1636. Its Main Street is set on high terrace above that river and the Hockanum River to the south, well protected from historic flooding. Originally part of Hartford, it was separately incorporated in 1783. The earliest parcels of the Center Cemetery, acquired in 1710, are the oldest surviving element of the early settlement period. The area prospered in the 18th century with agriculture and industry, the latter powered by the waters of the Hockanum River. Improved transportation systems of the late 19th century gradually transformed the center from a more agriculturally focused area to a residential suburb of Hartford, readily accessible via the Bulkeley Bridge and streetcar service. A significant area of Main Street was redeveloped after World War II, but a small portion near Central Avenue, and the residences lining that street and the adjacent cemetery, represent well the historic development of the town. The historic district includes four buildings on Main Street: the c. 1874 Albert Raymond House, the East Hartford Public Library, the 1939 Post Office building, and the c. 1919 Church's Corner Inn. The library is set in a park that was a gift of Albert Raymond, which includes a number of the town's war memorials. The library, built in 1889, is a fine example of Romanesque architecture. Extend east from the library is Central Avenue, which is lined mainly by 19th-century and early 20th-century houses. They are typically two stories in height and of wood frame construction. The most common styles found are the Italianate and Queen Anne, with many vernacular structures from the 1880s and 1890s. There are a few brick houses, as well as a few brick apartment houses near the eastern end of the street.

The war took place from 1289 to 1296. It was a conflict between two royal families over hereditary demands and special interests and was triggered by the murder of Eric V of Denmark. Background The murder of Erik V of Denmark in Findrup in 1286 had political consequences for the Danish nobles who had been in opposition. Several had powerful enemies, and wished to use the opportunity to punish them. As a result, they fled to Norway where the king ensured their safety. At the same time, a costly arbitration was concluded between the Norwegian National Board and German merchants. The Kingdom of Norway desired for territorial expansion southwards. Three years later, the Danish-Norwegian war gained the name The Outlaw War because the Danish outlawed nobles played a major role in the Norwegian war strategy against the Danish kingdom. In 1287, the Danish outlaws occupied northern Halland, swore allegiance to Eric II of Norway, and began the construction of fortresses in northern Halland. The war King Erik II's first war expedition with the outlaws, a fleet called the Leidgang, sailed into the Øresund on the night of 6 July 1289. One of the ships broke up and 160 men drowned. On 7 July, Helsingør was burned before the fleet set sail for Copenhagen. In the Siege of Copenhagen, the city withstood the attack and the Leidgang fleet sailed on. On Saturday, 9 July, Ven and Amager were burned but at the Battle of Skanör, the Norwegian Chieftain Thord Krytter fell with 70 men and the town was not destroyed. The castle in Samsø was attacked by Stig Andersen Hvide and destroyed. He also burned Torn Borg and Skelfiskør, and took Nykøbing. After an unsuccessful peace agreement, the Leidgang fleet went south of Møn to Grønsund and landed. They attacked and destroyed Falster, burning Stubbekøbing and attacking Stegeborg. King Erik II undertook other war expeditions with the outlaws, and probably also with his brother Duke Haakon. He arrived in Aalborg in 1290, and was there for 15 days in the hope that citizens would help and support him. Instead, resistance increased, forcing him to sail to Langeland, which he ravaged. He then burned Svendborg, before turning back to Agersø and Omø on Korsør, and burned Nykøbing in Odsherred and Holbæk. Stig Andersen Hvide landed on the island of Hjelm and fortified it, and the outlaws also fortified Sprogøe in the Storebælt and Samsø. In addition, Hunehals in northern Halland was fortified. In 1290, Danish king Erik Menved entered into an agreement with Mecklenburg princes Henry II of Werle and Nicholas II of Werle. The princes promised that they would not help the Norwegian king for two years, allow his forces to go through their country, or permit their subjects to go for service to him. In return, King Erik Menved promised the princes a considerable amount of money. Norwegian Duke Haakon Magnusson landed on 24 August 1293 in Vejle. He issued a \\"protection letter\\" for the Chors brothers in Viborg. These were on the island of Læsø. This suggests that the Norwegian Navy had full control in the Danish waters. A ceasefire was signed during a peace meeting at Hindsgavl Castle in 1295. The formal end of the war came in 1298. Aftermath A settlement between the Norwegian royal family and the Danish royal family was not finalized until 1308 (1310 in alternative source), after four years of peace. A declaration of war was made in 1307 but there was no fighting. Halland was split into a northern and southern part; the southern part remained in Denmark and the northern part went to Norway. Jacob Nielsen remained count of Halland but only the part in Norway. In 1305, Halland was given to the Norwegian king's son-in-law, Eric Magnusson, as a fief from Denmark.

The mayor will be elected by the supplementary vote. Incumbent Conservative mayor Tim Bowles will be seeking re-election. The Liberal Democrats have re-selected their 2017 candidate, former MP for Bristol West Stephen Williams. The Labour Party is currently going through the selection process. Background The West of England as a term has been used as a synonym for either South-West England or the former County of Avon which was abolished in the 1996. The West of England Combined Authority (WECA) is a statutory body which covers the areas of Bristol, South Gloucestershire, and Bath and North East Somerset. It broadly resembles the County of Avon. However, it does not have North Somerset because the council vetoed their joining the WECA; though they collaborate on some projects. The Mayor of the West of England is the democratically elected head of the WECA, and has powers over a £30m a year budget from the government, transport management, strategic planning of land and housing and the adult education budget. The first election with took place in 2017, saw Conservative candidate Tim Bowles win with 52% in the second round, the turnout was 29.7%, which was considered low by journalists. The urban think-tank Centre for Cities looked at the results of local elections in the West of England for 2018 and 2019 to make a prediction of the result and found Consevatives had suffered considerable losses in Bath and North East Somerset, stating that it \\"looks set to be tough for the incumbent\\". Though this election was scheduled to take place in 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom led to the elections planned to take place in May 2020 being delayed to occur at the same time, this includes elections for many other metro mayors across England. This means that the West of England Mayor will be elected the same time as the Mayor of Bristol, Bristol City Council and the Police and crime commissioner for Avon and Somerset Constabulary. Voting system The election will use a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference for candidates. * If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, that candidate wins. * If no candidate receives more than 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated. * The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count. * Voters' ballots whose first and second preference candidates are eliminated are discarded. * Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is one of the top two have their second preference votes added to that candidate's count. This means that the winning candidate has the support of a majority of voters who expressed a preference among the top two. All registered electors (British, Irish, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in the West of England aged 18 or over on 7 May 2020 will be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. Those who are temporarily away from Tees Valley (for example, away working, on holiday, in student accommodation or in hospital) will also be entitled to vote in the mayoral election. The deadline to register to vote in the election will be announced nearer the election. Candidates =Conservative Party= Incumbent metro mayor Tim Bowles, former councillor in South Gloucestershire and president of Bristol and South Gloucestershire Conservative Association, is standing for re- election. =Labour Party= =Liberal Democrats= Stephen Williams, MP for Bristol West 2005-2015 and former minister for communities and local government, is the candidate for the Liberal Democrats for the mayoralty.

The mayor will be elected by the supplementary vote. The election was originally due to take place in May 2020, but was postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Conservative incumbent mayor Ben Houchen will be seeking re-election, with Labour candidate Jessie Joe Jacobs challenging him. Background The mayor of Tees Valley serves as the directly elected leader of the Tees Valley Combined Authority and has powers considered lesser than those of other mayors such as Greater Manchester and the West of England. The mayor has power over an annual £15 million investment from the national government over a 30 year period, as well as control over adult skills training, social care and a consolidated transport budget- giving the ability to acquire bus services. The mayor does not supersede or overrule the five boroughs within the Tees Valley city-region. At the previous and first election for the mayor of Tees Valley in 2017, the Conservative Party candidate Ben Houchen won with 51.2% of the vote in the second round, with a turnout of 21%. This victory was seen as a surprise since Tees Valley has traditionally been seen as a Labour stronghold. Some saw Houchen's victory as evidence that the Conservatives were going to do well in the following election, others described it as a \\"warning shot\\" at Labour from their voter base. The urban think-tank Centre for Cities looked at the results of local elections in Tees Valley for 2018 and 2019 to make a prediction of the result and found Labour had suffered considerable losses, giving the Conservaties an advantage. Following the 2019 general election, the Centre for Cities also assessed the Tees Valley constituencies results and found the Conservatives polled 44% across all Tees Valley constituencies, whilst Labour polled 41%. It was announced in March 2020 that the mayoral election will be delayed to May 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United Kingdom. Electoral system The election will use a supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference for candidates. * If a candidate receives more than 50% of the first preference vote, that candidate wins. * If no candidate receives more than 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated. * The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count. * Voters' ballots whose first and second preference candidates are eliminated are discarded. * Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is one of the top two have their second preference votes added to that candidate's count.

The deadline to register to vote in the election will be announced nearer the election. Candidates =Conservative Party= Ben Houchen, the current mayor, launched his re-election campaign on 6 January. =Labour Party= Jessie Joe Jacobs was announced as the Labour Party candidate for the city-region. Jacobs is the founder of the charity A Way Out in Stockton and created a media project that taught ordinary people skills to report news called “We Are Our Media”, which created a citizen newspaper called the Eclipse. Jacobs received endorsement from all seven local parties in the area, five trade unions and the Co-operative party. Dan Smith, an engineer and staffer for Paul Williams, Labour's former MP for Stockton South, also applied; however, he was not shortlisted. =Liberal Democrats= Though the Liberal Democrats party has stated they planned to announced a candidate in mid-January, no one has been declared yet. Campaign The incumbent mayor Ben Houchen launched his initial campaign for this election - prior to its delay - in January 2020, emphasising on investment in the steel industry in Tees Valley. On 9 February it was revealed Houchen was in talks to purchase the former steelworks site in Redcar, which closed in 2015 when Sahaviriya Steel Industries's UK wing went out of business. Labour's candidate Jessie Joe Jacobs launched her campaign at the Hartlepool College of Further Education. Her core pledges for this election are to tackle mental health across the city-region where suicide rates are high, to build a new vocation centre in all five boroughs, start a high street innovation fund to help fill closed down retail spaces and to improve transport. She advocated expanding bus and rail services in the city-region over the next ten years. This include restarting the Tees Valley Metro project, which was stopped in 2010. Additionally, she is supportive of building a new bridge to improve transport between Hartlepool and South Teesside to help relieve pressure on the A19 and A66. Jacobs has planned to bid to host the Festival of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, a government proposed festival with £125 million prepared for it, in 2022, branding it as the \\"Festival of Teesside\\". On 10 November 2019 Jacobs was critical of the price Houchen arranged for Teesside Airport, which Houchen's administration had taken into public ownership, saying that the previous owner received a lot more than she would have allowed, considering they wanted to get rid of it. Furthermore, on 11 February 2020, Jacobs was critical of Ben Houchen's lack of transparency over subsiding flight routes out of Teesside Airport rather than expanding bus routes around the city region. A hustings organised by Centre for Cities, the Institution of Civil Engineers and Teesside University was due to take place on 23 April but was cancelled due to Covid-19.

Formed in 1993, the line-up consists of vocalist Randy Cordeiro (Surreal Neil), guitarist Chris Collins, bass guitarist Matt Tidmarsh, keyboardist James Terris, keyboardist Rama Kolesnikow and drummer Vince Littleton. Super Diamond have been featured in articles in many national publications and have appeared on the David Letterman Show. The San Francisco Chronicle has recently said, \\"Super Diamond does Neil Diamond without any irony, but with loving enthusiasm — and a lot of practice.\\" In 2003 Sid Bernstein in The New York Times wrote, \\"Super Diamond interprets Mr. Diamond's pop tunes with heavier guitars, mixing in contemporary riffs by Guns N' Roses, Kiss, and AC/DC, and with an alternative-rock tone.\\".  Early Days in San Francisco  Super Diamond's early performances in San Francisco were at notorious alternative rock venues such as the Paradise Lounge, Slim’s, and the DNA Lounge. The band quickly progressed to regular shows at The Fillmore, The Great American Music Hall and Bimbo’s 365 Club. Much to Super Diamond’s astonishment and delight, they found a plentiful and enthusiastic audience ready to celebrate Neil Diamond's musical legacy. Sell-out shows at all these venues ensued.  Touring Nationally  In the mid nineties Super Diamond began to expand their fan base with forays into Los Angeles, San Diego, Portland, and Seattle. Before the wider use of the internet and well before social media, Super Diamond generated a new audience in each of these out-of-town markets, relying principally on word-of-mouth. Early shows at the Crocodile in Seattle, The Belly Up Tavern in Solana Beach, and the House of Blues in West Hollywood were well attended and quickly built up to sell-out engagements. Spring-boarding on this, Super Diamond gained audiences at Irving Plaza in New York City, 930 Club in Washington DC, House of Blues in Chicago, Ogden Theater in Denver, The Paradise Rock Club in Boston, and many other venues across the country. “We’ve been traveling the country and spreading the good word of Neil for 15 years now,” Cordeiro said in a phone interview. He and the rest of Super Diamond were just about to go on stage at a House of Blues in San Diego — one of their 110 shows per year. “When we first started it, we never thought it would be a national thing,” Cordeiro, who is also known as Surreal Neil, said. “We thought it would be a little San Francisco band. Now this is how we're making our living. It was a pleasant surprise to find out there was a market for it.” Continuous sell out shows across the country lead to Super Diamond appearing on CNN, Fox News, Comedy Central, Axis TV, and The Late Night Show with David Letterman. Super Diamond has also performed twice at the Hollywood Bowl. Super Diamond in New York  Neil Diamond Joins Super Diamond On Stage  Meredith May in the San Francisco Chronicle wrote, \\"Neil is a big supporter of Super Diamond. He came backstage at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and thanked the band members.\\"I thanked him for not suing us,\\" Cordero says. \\"Then he sang 'I Am ... I Said' with us. Now his steel drummer often plays with us when he's not on the road.\\" \\"In 2000, Diamond finally came to see the band at the House of Blues, which is a couple of miles from Diamond's home in Beverly Hills. He came again in 2001 when Super Diamond was performing at the premiere party for the romantic comedy \\"Saving Silverman,\\" in which Neil Diamond has a cameo role as himself. Both times Diamond took the stage and sang with his bizarro band. Performing with the real Neil was a blast, Cordero says. \\"I couldn't believe how nice and normal he seemed for someone who is a living legend\\"(The Morning Call 2004). \\"The real Neil sat in with Super Diamond at the House of Blues, singing \\"I Am, I Said.\\" Or should that have been \\"We Are, We Said?\\" Says Diamond: \\"It is a little strange, I have to admit it, seeing someone up there trying to be you. A little weird but also fun. God bless them all, I hope they do great.\\" \\"The second time Neil sang with us was for the Saving Silverman premiere party. We were contacted and hired to play the party after the screening. Neil and the cast joined us onstage for two songs, “Cherry Cherry” and “Forever in Blue Jeans\\". We were instructed a day or so before that we would be playing \\"Cherry Cherry\\" and possibly \\"Forever in Blue Jeans\\". So I told the band to transition right into \\"Forever in Blue Jeans\\". Terris: I think it was Columbia Pictures that released the movie. They wanted Neil to play a few songs with the cast at the film's release party, again at the House of Blues. He asked us to back him up, it was an honor, and a ton of fun.\\" (The Stranger Seattle 2009)  Super Diamond with Symphony  Super Diamond has performed numerous shows with symphony orchestras around the country such as San Diego Symphony, Santa Rosa Symphony, Moorpark Symphony - Los Angeles, Pacific Symphony, Utah Symphony, Modesto Symphony, Phoenix Symphony, Grand Rapids Symphony, Charlotte Symphony, Tucson Symphony, Knoxville Symphony, The Desert Symphony - Palm Desert, Pittsburgh Symphony, Ocean City Pops - New Jersey, Spokane Symphony, and Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra. At these performances Super Diamond perform Neil Diamond's repertoire with full orchestration, often with renowned conductors.

Characteristics All of the members of the subfamily Poeciliinae are ovoviviparous, i.e. they give birth to live young, except Tomereus, with internal fertilisation and a large yolk in the egg. The males have the anterior rays, normally the third to fifth rays, in the anal fin elongated to form an intromittent organ called the gonopodium. Habitat and distribution The Poeciliinae are predominantly freshwater fish but some species live in brackish water, and some can even tolerate seawater. They are found in North America as far north as southern Canada, Central America and South America through to Patagonia. Some of the world's most popular aquarium fish such as guppies, swordtails and mollies are from this subfamily. They have been introduced to many regions in the world, either accidentally or to control mosquitoes, and have become invasive species threatening local populations of similar, small fishes. For example, the Eastern mosquitofish Gambusia holbrooki is considered to be one of the 100 worst invasive species in the world and is responsible for declines in small native aquatic species worldwide.

She has been the president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum since April 2016, when she became the first woman heading a major American oil company. Early life and education Vicki Hollub was born in 1960 in Birmingham, Alabama and graduated in 1977 from McAdory High School. She attended the University of Alabama, where in 1981 she earned a Bachelor of Science (BS) degree in mineral engineering with a concentration in fuels and mineral resources. Hollub was also in the 2016 class of Distinguished Engineering Fellows from the University of Alabama College of Engineering. Career =Joining Occidental and Permian expansion= Initially working on oil rigs in Mississippi, Hollub started her career in 1981 with Cities Service, when it was a fully integrated oil and gas company. Cities Service was acquired by Occidental Petroleum Corporation in 1982. She subsequently held technical and management positions for Occidental in the United States, Russia, Venezuela, and Ecuador. In 2005, Hollub became involved in leading Occidental's expansion in the Permian Basin in West Texas and southeastern New Mexico. She was manager of operations for Occidental's Permian business from 2009 until 2011, before being promoted to president and general manager from 2011 until 2012. =Executive management roles= From 2012 until 2013 Hollub was executive vice president of Occidental's operations in California. In October 2013 she was named both Occidental Petroleum's vice president and the executive vice president of U.S. Operations, Oxy Oil and Gas, a role she held until July 2014. From 2014 until May 2015, she was the executive vice president of Occidental Petroleum and president of Occidental Oil & Gas Corp in the Americas from July 2014 until May 2015, which gave her oversight of operations in Latin America and worldwide exploration. In May 2015, Occidental's board of directors selected Hollub to succeed retiring chief executive officer (CEO) Stephen Chazen, basing their decision on Hollub's \\"strong track record of successfully growing [Occidental's] domestic oil and gas business profitably and efficiently.\\" During a subsequent transition period she was responsible for operations in the Middle East, Latin America and the United States. In May 2015, she was named senior executive vice president of Occidental and president of Oxy Oil and Gas. Later that year, in December 2015 Hollub was appointed the global president and chief operating officer (COO) of Occidental, with oversight for the company's midstream, chemical, and oil and gas operations. =CEO and president= Hollub officially became president and CEO of Occidental Petroleum in April 2016, with responsibility for operations, strategy and financial management. The appointment made her the first woman to head a major American oil company, and that year Fortune named her #32 on its annual list of the Most Powerful Women in business. Hollub was appointed CEO during a severe downturn in the oil industry. Under Hollub, Occidental cut production costs in response to falling crude prices but decided not to lay off employees. The company focused on existing core operations in the Middle East, the United States, and Colombia in Latin America, while continuing to sell low-yield fields in Iraq, Libya, Yemen, North Dakota, Colorado, Kansas, and Oklahoma. Hollub placed \\"particular emphasis\\" on developing the Permian Basin in the southern United States, which had been a consistent driver of profits. Half of Occidental's output was coming from the Permian Basin by July 2017, while the other half came from Qatar, Oman, the United Arab Emirates and Colombia. At that time, Forbes wrote that Hollub's focus on high-producing oil fields had made Occidental \\"leaner\\" and \\"poised to gusher cash for the next half-century.\\" On 2019, Occidental Petroleum acquired Anadarko Petroleum and assumed its debt. Hollub was a major proponent of the deal, and personally enlisted financing from Warren Buffett in order to complete it. Occidental did not allow shareholders to vote on the deal, which drew criticism from several major investors including sixth-largest shareholder T. Rowe Price. In March 2020 amid a major stock market crash and an international oil crisis that saw the company's stock price plummet dramatically, a group of activist investors led by Carl Icahn have stated their desire to replace the entire Occidental board of directors, including Hollub. Icahn wrote an open letter stating his view that Hollub and the board bought Anadarko to save their own jobs, and failed to protect shareholders' capital when they heavily indebted Occidental by borrowing over $40 billion in order to purchase Anadarko at a \\"massive\\" 65% premium. Boards and councils She was elected to the board of directors at Occidental Petroleum in December 2015. She is the U.S. chair for the U.S.-Colombia Business Council. She also is on the boards of Khalifa University for Science and Technology in Abu Dhabi and the American Petroleum Institute. Hollub is a member of the Society of Petroleum Engineers (SPE). Personal life Hollub is a longtime fan of her alma mater's Alabama Crimson Tide football program, particularly under former coach Bear Bryant.

The CallisonRTKL-designed complex will feature a five-star Park Hyatt hotel with interiors by Studio Munge, as well as 504 residences and a collection of retailers and restaurants. It will also be home to the city's tallest residential tower, which commenced construction in 2015. The towers currently have no completion date. It is unknown when the complex will open as it is having financing issues, and work was suspended. Limited work resumed in early 2019. By the end of 2019, construction slowed again. Los Angeles and US national media reports the towers are currently on hold due to Chinese foreign real estate investment capital being pulled due to the China–United States trade war. The scheduled 2020 opening date was pushed back to an unknown date. Design Designed by CallisonRTKL. Tower one will feature a 184-room five star Park Hyatt hotel along with 164 Park Hyatt serviced condo residences; a live in hotel option. It will reach a total height of 675 ft, 49 floors. Towers two and three will have 504 residential condominiums. They will reach a total of 530 ft; 40 floors in height. When completed, they will become the 11th and 21st tallest buildings in Los Angeles. The Park Hyatt project marks the luxury brand's first hotel and branded residences on the West Coast. That 49-story building will consist of a 184-room hotel topped by 164 serviced hotel residences. (The other 340 apartments will be housed in two 40-story towers, The Residences at Oceanwide Plaza.) Located adjacent to the Staples Center and L.A. Live near the Los Angeles Convention Center, project participants say the complex's design offers a departure from the standardized glass curtain and masonry architecture of the city's downtown. The developer, Beijing-based Oceanwide Holdings, enlisted CallisonRTKL as a consultant to design features such as the 700-ft. LED ribbon wrapping the perimeter of the building. Beyond that, the firm plans to create glass elevators with LED bands and landscaped retail paseos that incorporate local plant life. A retail mall named The Collection at Oceanwide Plaza is scheduled to open on the first three floors above ground with 153,000 square feet of retail space. The mall will be open air and have deck views of L.A. Live. The 9th floor will feature a two-acre private park. Features include private cantilevered deck pools, viewing platforms, basketball court, a dog park, green space and a running track. Celebrity fitness trainer and nutritionist Harley Pasternak has conceptualized the development's amenity spaces, including a two-acre sky park. Leisure offerings such as a fitness center, children's play area, basketball court and two dog parks will also be on-site. History The site was a vacant parking lot used by Staples Center patrons in the South Park neighborhood of Downtown Los Angeles. The site is immediately west of the Los Angeles Metro Rail Station Pico/Chick Hearn. This development is part of a group of projects currently under construction on Figueroa allowed to add giant video advert screens facing Staples Center.

Contractor Lendlease suspended work until late March 2019 when it was announced construction resumed after nine active liens have been filed by subcontractors totaling US$98.6 million. Due to the three month stop and restart of work, opening date was pushed back to an unknown date. Work once again stopped in late 2019 due to delays. Media reports the towers are stuck in limbo over unpaid work and pending lawsuits. The towers are an example of Chinese pull back of capitol and investing in US real estate because of its ongoing trade dispute with the U.S. and a Beijing crackdown on credit and capital flight.

The station originally had one low platform although this was rebuilt along with a second platform when the line was doubled in 1901. The station had full goods yard facilities on the up side of the line, which was accessed from the south. The layout was changed when the line doubled in 1901 with three sidings, two serving a loading dock and the other serving a coal depot. The main goods traffic at the station was barley, with 428 tons being dispatched from it in 1911. Only one wagon of livestock was loaded at the station in 1913. The station was closed due to the First World War on 20 September 1915 but it reopened in April 1920 with only one up train and two down trains. The station was once again closed due to the Second World War on 11 September 1939, although it never reopened. The official date of closure to passengers was on 2 September 1946 and closed to goods traffic on 11 November 1963. In April 1918, the tender of a steam train travelling between Northallerton and Ripon at , came off the rails to the north of the station, but stayed upright and the effect of its derailing caused the train to split in two. The engine driver managed to stop the train on Maunby Bridge (over the River Swale) some after the initial derailment. The rear seven detached carriages tore the line up after the locomotive and came to a rest just before the bridge and narrowly avoided falling down the embankment into the River Swale. A fire broke out in the third carriage caused by a ruptured gas pipe, but it was extinguished by the guard. Of the 160 people aboard the train, only three minor injuries were recorded.

It can be used to denote a group of people who hold this title as well as individuals who possess the title.  Etymology  The name of this title traces its origin back to the Book of Documents (also known as the Shû King through the translation of James Legge) which is written in old Chinese language. In the chapter \\"The establishment of government\\"(立政), the phrase \\"All good men of constant virtue (庶常吉士尚書·立政:大都、小伯、藝人、表臣、百司、太史、尹伯、庶常吉士，司徒、司馬、司空、亞旅、夷、微、盧、烝、三亳、阪、尹。文王惟克厥宅心，乃克立茲常事司牧人，以克俊有德。)\\" which is pronounced as \\"Shuchangjishi\\" appeared during a conversation between Zhougong, a moral model of Confucianism, and King Cheng of Zhou,James Legge, Translation of The Shu King.1879 the ruler of China in the early 11th century BC. Zhougong asks his nephew King of China to appoint officials with great care and prudence. He elaborated on the subject of the selection of officials and its significance in relation to the well-being of the government. All good men of constant virtue, according to Zhougong, are the ones that are to be trusted and assigned with important tasks.  Official use  In Ming China and Qing China, The title Shujishi is granted solely to the Jinshi rank. The Jinshi are a group of intellectuals that has passed the imperial exams. The Shujishi was installed in the year of 1385 by the decree of Emperor Taizu of Ming, it was the 18th year of his rule when Shujishi first appeared in the records of history.《明太祖實錄》卷一七二(洪武十八年三月)丙子條：以第一甲賜進士及第丁顯等為翰林院修撰，第二甲賜進士出身馬京等為編修、吳文為檢討、李震為承敕郎、陳廣為中書舍人；第三甲賜同進士出身危瓛為衛府紀善、李鴻綱為譚府奉祠正、楊靖為吏科庶吉士、黃耕為承敕郎、蹇瑢為中書舍人、鄒仲寶為國子監助教。瑢後賜名義。其諸進士，上以其未更事俗，優待之，俾之親政於諸司，給以所出身祿米，俟其諳練政體，然後擢任之。其在翰林院承敕監等近傍衙門者，采《書經》「庶常吉士」之義，俱稱為庶吉士。其在六部及諸司者，仍稱進士。 Novices of the Jinshi rank undergo a process of selection and some of them are bestowed the title Shujishi. Once became Shujishi, they work as apprentice in the Hanlin Academy with the purpose of perfecting their skills of administration. During the reign of emperor Yinzong of Ming, the definition of Shujishi was narrowed down. Jinshi from the second place(二甲) or the third place(三甲) who are outstanding in terms of virtue are selected to be Shujishi in the Hanlin Academy. These elite Jinshi are called \\"Academy's selection\\"(館選). The Jinshi who obtained top place in the imperial exams received more privileged titles such as Xiuzhuan(修撰) and Bianxiu(編修). However, Xiuzhuan and Bianxiu are distinct titles that are different from Shujishi. A stricter standard was applied during the reign of emperor Shizong of Qing. All Shujishi hold the title for a term of three years before been officially examined. During the three year long period, they study with experienced scholars in the Hanlin Academy. These Shujishi who had not received an official examination were called Sanguan(散館). Once Sanguan's knowledge were examined, those who were able to achieve success in their study will be formally accepted as a scholar of the Hanlin academy while those who were inferior to their peer Shujishi will be allotted to other departments of government.

It is located at the corner of Dmytra Yavornytskoho Avenue and Korolenko Street and currently houses Grand Hotel Ukraina. History The house was completed in 1913. The estate owner and engineer Vladimir Khrennikov hired a young architect Pyotr Fetisov to develop the project. Another architect, Lyudomir- Flavian Khoynovsky, also participated. The idea to built a house in a traditional Ukrainian style belonged to a historian Dmytro Yavornytsky, who lived in Yekaterinoslav and knew Khrennikov. Vladimir Khrennikov was the son of merchant Nikolay Khrennikov and Lyubov Belyavskaya, a daughter of merchant Prokofy Belyavsky, who on two occasions was elected the mayor of Yekaterinoslav. Khrennikov inherited the estate from his mother. He graduated from Imperial Petersburg Institute of Technology and travelled around Europe before returning to Yekaterinoslav at around 1905. The estate where the house is not standing was occupied by trading arcades built before 1870 by Belyavsky. Khrennikov, who was a sympathisant of Ukrainian national movement, decided to demolish the trading arcades and to build a revenue house in the Ukrainian Modern style. The construction lasted between 1910 and 1913; in parallel, one of the renters of the old building refused to move out and had to be sued. The new rental agreements started from 1 January 1914. In 1914, a cinema was opened in the building, and the lower floors were occupied by shops and warehouses. The upper floors were in 1915 rented to the Emperor Nicholas II First Commercial School, which had its own building used for a military hospital. The room was insufficient for the school, which had to cut a number of incoming students. The building has a complicated shape with a central tower with a spire looking at the street crossing. The walls are white, except for two large paintings made of maiolica. There are many details, including arches and windows, which are clearly inspired by real or imaginary architecture of the Zaporizhian Sich. In 1918, after the October Revolution Khrennikov left the city, abandoning all of his properties. He remained in Russia and died in Kislovodsk in 1936. After 1920, the building housed the Central District Committee of the Communist Party, a central statistical office, a club, and an art museum, as well as a number of state and commercial organizations. The house was considerably damaged during World War II. In the 1950s, it was restored, and the hotel was housed in the building.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. It recounts the story of the Battle of Yorktown. Synopsis The Surrender of Lord Cornwallis, an 1820 painting by John Trumbull depicting the surrender of the British to French forces The song begins with Alexander Hamilton, having been promoted to a command position in the Continental Army by George Washington, meeting with his friend Marquis de Lafayette and discussing their plans after the impending conclusion of the war. It is revealed that Hamilton's friend Hercules Mulligan was spying on the British forces to give information to the American forces. Hamilton also remarks on his wife and her pregnancy with their first child, and how John Laurens went to South Carolina in an effort to form a black battalion of soldiers. The Continental Forces then proceed to begin fighting, with Hamilton ordering his three battalions to remove the bullets from their firearms before their assault on British Redoubts 9 and 10. The Americans, assisted by the French, succeed in the battle, with their opponents waving a white flag. Hamilton then describes the British retreat, saying that he heard \\"the drinking song they were singing.\\" Analysis The song takes its title from an English ballad, which according to legend was performed by the British army band on the orders of Lord Cornwallis during their retreat. Whether or not this is historically accurate is not known, as it was incorporated into the story a century after the siege. Much of the song, particularly towards its beginning, functions as a reprise of \\"My Shot\\", as Hamilton remarks on how potential death lies ahead. The song contains a hint of \\"Lose Yourself\\" by Eminem, as well as a lyrical reference to A Tribe Called Quest's track Jazz (We've Got), one of many callbacks in the musical to hip-hop and rap. Critical reception A community poll on Buzzfeed ranked the song as the 21st best in the musical, while The Young Folks had it ranked 27th. Elizabeth Logan, writing for Huffington Post, stated that the song was a \\"rollicking remix\\", while Vibe.com said that the song gave the audience the opportunity to \\"hear the perseverance of the soldiers in the war\\". Performances The original Broadway cast, having been introduced by Barack and Michelle Obama, performed the song, as well as its immediate predecessor, at the 70th Tony Awards prior to winning eleven awards. However, following the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, they did not use muskets out of respect. \\"Immigrants (We Get the Job Done)\\" A rap song inspired by and sampling from \\"Yorktown\\" was recorded for The Hamilton Mixtape. The song took inspiration from the line shared between Hamilton and Lafayette—\\"Immigrants—we get the job done\\". It was performed by K'naan, Snow Tha Product, Riz MC (Riz Ahmed) and Residente. Miranda selected those performers as they represent all corners of the world, in line with the song's message. It also incorporates Washington's line from the original—\\"Not yet\\", which Miranda said meant that America has yet to achieve full freedom as a society. Slate.com considered the new take on the song to be the best on the mixtape. A music video was released in June 2017. The song was nominated for \\"Best Fight Against the System\\" at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards and shared the win with the other five nominees. The song peaked at number 22 on the Rap Digital Song Sales chart.

A prominent part of the city's downtown business district, the city hall is an architecturally distinguished former hotel, while the park includes a substantial Beaux Arts Civil War memorial. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history New Britain's City Hall is a complex of three buildings on the north side of West Main Street between Washington and Main Streets. They stand facing the triangular Central Park, formed by West Main and one-way branchest of Main Street. The park is a predominantly paved area, with plantings lining its east and west sides. At its center is a circular grassy area, raised behind a low retaining wall, which has at its center the city's memorial to its American Civil War participants. It is a richly decorated square structure built out of limestone. Each face has Doric columns supporting a gabled pediment as its first stage, the elements framing different things on each face. Above this is another square stage with inscribed panels on each side and gold-leaf sconces at the corners. A circular pedestal set above this supports a golden winged victory statue. The monument was designed by Ernest Flagg and placed in 1900. City Hall consists of a large central five-story building, flanked on the left by a small three-story building and the right by a two-story one. The central building is the former Russwin Hotel, built in 1885 to a Romanesque design by Joseph Morrill Wells, an assistant to the famous architect Stanford White. It appears very much like an Italian palazzo, with an exterior that extensively uses terra cotta tile. It is notable as the only known work that is ascribed exclusively to Wells. When the building was adapted for use as city hall, the design work was done by McKim, Meade & White. The building to the left is a former post office, built in 1871, and that to the right is the former New Britain National Bank Building, dating to 1860–61. These two buildings are both well preserved examples of commercial Italianate architecture.

Language development may be severely delayed from the lack of language exposure during this period. This was observed in well-known clinical case studies such as Genie, Kaspar Hauser, Anna, and Isabelle, as well as cases analyzing feral children such as Victor. Subsequently, all of these children had typical hearing. Similarly, language deprivation in deaf and hard of hearing children often occurs with insufficient language exposure in the first few years of life. Deaf children who experience limited access to language—spoken or signed—may not develop the necessary skills to successfully assimilate into the academic learning milieu. Age of enrollment in early intervention services and strength of parental involvement are the strongest success indicators for language development in deaf children. Numerous communication modalities have been employed for deaf and hard of hearing children. In addition, experts have adopted varied educational philosophies for teaching deaf and hard of hearing individuals. The most effective communication method and educational philosophy for this population remains controversial within the field of deaf research.  Statistics  Approximately 90–95% of deaf and hard of hearing children are born to hearing parents. These parents may be unfamiliar with the deaf culture. Most importantly, these parents are often unaware of the best communication methods to assist their children with developing into contributing members of society.Moores, D. (2001). Educating the Deaf: Psychology, Principles, and Practices (5th ed.). Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin Company.  Access to language  = Critical period = The first five years of a child's life is a critical time for cognitive development and the establishment of their native language. This critical period deems the first few years of life as the period during which language develops. After this critical period of language acquisition, it remains exceedingly laborious and strenuous to master a native language. Studies on infancy stroke and typical language development unveiled a critical, or sensitive, period for language acquisition. Likewise, renowned researchers Elissa Newport and Rachel Mayberry support the existence of this critical stage in language development. Elissa Newport and Rachel Mayberry’s work revealed that deaf individuals who lack exposure to sign language at a young age fail to achieve full language proficiency as they develop. Additionally, deaf individuals who acquired sign language after five years of age were not nearly as proficient as deaf individuals who were exposed to sign language from birth. Language deprivation influenced altered neural activation patterns in deaf individuals later exposed to sign language as compared to deaf individuals who received typical language development. Inconsistencies in exposure to a natural language during this critical period of language acquisition could result in persistent symptoms, known as language deprivation syndrome. Symptoms of language deprivation syndrome include language dysfluency (e.g., lack of fluency in native language), knowledge gaps about the world around them, abnormal thinking, mood and/or behavior disorders, academic, and literacy delays. = Language modality = = Incidental learning and access to knowledge = The importance of early accessible communication with family and peers can be seen in the ‘dinner table syndrome'—the experience of observing spoken conversations between other family members and not understanding these conversations. As statistics show, 90-95% of deaf children are born to hearing parents, thus, they may often experience this phenomena if their family does not use sign language. A famous deaf artist, Susan Dupor, painted an art piece called \\"family dog” to represent this syndrome. This artwork candidly represents the feeling of isolation being deaf in an all hearing family. The feeling most resembles being the family pet, hence the name, “Family Dog.” This painting was designed to emphasize deaf family members’ perspectives with the blurred faces of the family metaphorically representing the difficulties of lip reading. In these situations, deaf children are unable to participate in the conversations without using a common language, such as a visual sign language. Similarly, these experiences occur during societal social engagements where deaf individuals cannot communicate with other individuals through a spoken language. When hearing individuals share information with each other in a way that is not accessible to deaf individuals, the deaf individuals are not privy to these ‘incidental learning’ experiences. Incidental learning refers to any unprompted, unplanned, or unintended learning. This type of learning occurs in everyday communication including emotional expression, navigating arguments, and managing triggers. Language deprivation syndrome coupled with the lack of these every day incidental learning experiences may impact mental health, physical health, and academic advancements. A lack of incidental learning can also limit an individual's general wealth of knowledge and comprehension skills used to learn about and understand the world around them.Cheng Q, Roth A, Halgren E and Mayberry RI (2019) Effects of Early Language Deprivation on Brain Connectivity: Language Pathways in Deaf Native and Late First-Language Learners of American Sign Language. Front. Hum. Neurosci. 13:320. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2019.00320 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2019.00320/full  American Deaf Educational Philosophy  = Auditory-oral = = Mainstream = Mainstream education is the philosophy of integrating students requiring special education services into a general education classroom based on their skills. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) mandates the specificities of this integration. IDEA protects students who are typically a part of the special education classroom by granting the right to enroll in the general education classroom. This applies to situations that may be in the best interest of these special education students. In terms of deaf students, deafness is considered a low-incidence disability. This translates to the possibility of one deaf child belonging to a classroom with other “hearing” childrenStinson, M., & Antia, S. (1999). \\"Considerations in Educating Deaf and Hard of Hearing Students in Inclusive Settings\\". Journal of Deaf Studies and Deaf Education. 4 (3): 163–174. doi:10.1093/deafed/4.3.163. PMID 15579885 and results in unique barriers. For example, students within the mainstream setting may not know sign language will serve as significant communication barriers for deaf students. These deaf students may use accommodations in their general classroom setting such as a sign language interpreters, communication access real-time translation (CART), or a FM system. = Bilingual-bicultural = Deaf children without early access to signed language remain at risk for starting school unprepared for the rigors of academic learning. One challenge for deaf children is not having the ability to use their natural language, simultaneously associate it to formal written language, and blending these two forms of communication when partaking in social interactions. This is where an educational philosophy known as the Bilingual-bicultural (Bi-Bi) found in deaf schools can be beneficial for deaf students. Bi-Bi emphasizes that deaf children learn visually and education should be provided through a visual language. Bi-Bi supporters' argue because of the variability in cochlear implant and hearing aid outcomes, sign language access is crucial for preventing deaf and hard-of-hearing children from experiencing language deprivation. This approach began to emerge in schools during the late 1980s in the United States, Denmark, and Sweden. Congruently, in America, the ASL/English Bi- Bi is designed to facilitate academic success and provide education to deaf students by learning sign language, as a first language, followed by a written or spoken language (such as English) as their second language. Furthermore, deaf schools offer exposure to Deaf culture—a unique facet not provided by mainstream and auditory-oral based education. Therefore, through the Bi-Bi approach, deaf students may master two cultures, both Deaf culture and hearing culture.  Communication approaches  = Auditory verbal/learning and spoken language = = Bilingual approaches = = Cued speech =  LEAD-K  LEAD-K stands for Language Equality & Acquisition for Deaf Kids. It is a controversial effort in the United States intended to increase the number of deaf children who use American Sign Language. The LEAD-K initiative aims to \\"end language deprivation\\" by promoting American Sign Language, and by putting new laws in place to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing children begin learning both American Sign Language and English before kindergarten enrollment. The main goal of LEAD-K is to promote a foundation for American Sign Language within deaf and hard of hearing children. The organization has drafted state-level legislative bills which passed in California, Kansas, Hawaii, and Oregon in 2015–2016. Versions of the bill have been proposed in at least twelve states since 2016, but all have failed to pass.Tiggs, S. (n.d.). LEAD-K Bills and Deaf Child Bill of Rights.

He played college football at Ohio State, and high school football at Tarboro High School.  High school career  Lewis played high school football for Tarboro High School in Tarboro, North Carolina, where he was part of multiple state championship teams. As a senior, he was named to the Associated Press' North Carolina all-football team. Coming out of high school, Lewis was rate a four- star prospect by major recruiting services. A member of the class of 2013, Lewis committed to Ohio State University on September 20, 2012. Lewis also had scholarship offers from schools such as Louisiana State University, the University of North Carolina, Virginia Tech, and Clemson University. He had to convince his mother of the merits of going to Ohio State; she was worried because of the far distance from North Carolina.  Collegiate career  His redshirt freshman year at Ohio State, Lewis appeared in every game whether on defense or playing a small role on special teams. He recorded nine tackles on the season. For his sophomore season, Lewis broke into the regular rotation and led the team in quarterback sacks with eight and finished second to teammate Joey Bosa in tackles for loss with fourteen. Lewis received a national championship ring as the Buckeyes won their eighth National Championship in the first College Football Playoff in January 2015. For his efforts, Lewis was named Honorable Mention on the 2015 All-Big Ten Conference football team. He played through the season with an injured labrum, which he had injured the previous spring, and had a surgical procedure to repair the muscle the following January. Lewis continued his award-winning ways in 2016, as he racked up 7.5 sacks, sealed a win against Wisconsin, was named a captain, and won multiple accolades while developing into a leader off the field. He was named first-team 2016 All-Big Ten Conference football team and was the Big Ten Conference Defensive Lineman of the Year. In January 2017, Lewis announced that he would skip the 2017 NFL Draft and return to OSU for his senior season. Along with teammate J. T. Barrett, Lewis was named a Big Ten Preseason Honoree before his senior season. He later earned a spot on the first team of the 2017 All-Big Ten Conference football team. He also recorded 6.5 tackles for loss and five quarterback sacks. Lewis also tied the Ohio State football record for games played with 55. In the Senior Bowl, Lewis had one and a half sacks, including working with Ogbonnia Okoronkwo for a strip- sack.  Professional career  On December 18, 2017, it was announced that Lewis had accepted his invitation to play in the 2018 Senior Bowl. On January 27, 2018, Lewis recorded four combined tackles and a sack as part of Denver Broncos' head coach Vance Joseph's North team that lost 45–16 to the South. Lewis attended the NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis, but was limited to the vertical jump and broad jump due to a bout with the flu. On March 22, 2018, Lewis participated at Ohio State's pro day and performed the majority of combine drills, but chose to skip the vertical jump. At the conclusion of the pre-draft process, Lewis was projected to be a third or fourth round pick by the majority of NFL draft experts and scouts. He was ranked the ninth best defensive end prospect in the draft by Scouts Inc. and was ranked the 12th best defensive end by DraftScout.com. The Indianapolis Colts selected Lewis in the second round (64th overall) of the 2018 NFL Draft. The Indianapolis Colts traded their third (67th overall) and sixth round (178th overall) picks to the Cleveland Browns and drafted Lewis with the second round pick they received in exchange. On May 11, 2018, the Indianapolis Colts signed Lewis to a four-year, $4.36 million contract that includes a signing bonus of $1.25 million.

Sholem Asch called her \\"the Poetess of Jerusalem\\". Potash was born in Ojców. Her father Yekutiel Potash was a correspondent for the Yiddish newspaper Unzer Lebn. Her brother Mordekhai Narkiss (1898–1957) later became director of the Bezalel Museum. Potash's early work was written and published in Polish, but following the Lwów pogrom of 1918 she turned to Yiddish. Beginning in 1922 she published a variety of works in Yiddish, including nature poetry, short stories, children's stories, and translations of Polish works. In 1924, she moved to Łódź, which at the time had the Poland's second-largest population of Jews and was a center of modernist experimentation. She married poet Khayim-Leyb Fuks (1897–1953) and they had a daughter, Avivit, in 1926. She first came to widespread attention after the inclusion of four of her poems in Ezra Korman's Yidishe dikhterins: antologye (\\"Yiddish Women Poets: Anthology\\", 1928). Her first collection of poetry, Vint oyf klavishn (\\"Wind on Keys\\"), was published in Łódź in 1934.

In 1934, she divorced Fuks and emigrated with Avivit to Jerusalem, where she worked as librarian for the Bezalel Art School and Museum for the rest of her life. She published two more volumes of poetry, Fun Kidron Tol (1952) and Moled iber Timma (1959).

Behind the hitting of Harper, and the leadership of coach Tim Chambers, the Coyotes had their best season to date, with a record of 52–16, and a playoff finish as semifinalists of the JUCO World Series at Suplizio Field in Grand Junction, Colorado. Following this season, Harper would be the first overall selection in the 2010 MLB Draft. In his MLB Career with the Washington Nationals and Philadelphia Phillies, Harper has been a multiple time All-Star the National League Rookie of the year, and the National League MVP.

Family and early life (1858-1879) Peter Kaufmann, Sr. (Grabi Peter, 1832-1903, standing right) with client Frederick Gardiner (1850-1919, standing left); Peter Knubel (1832-1919, seated left) and Charles Pilkington (1850-1918, seated right). 1877.Peter Kaufmann was born in his family's house in Grindelwald and named after his father, Peter Kaufmann (born May 21, 1832 – died October 26, 1903) whose nickname \\"Grabi Peter\\" Friedli, Emanuel. Bärndütsch als Spiegel bernischen Volkstums: Grindelwald. Bern: Francke Verlag, 1908, p. 27. referred to the location of the house in which he was born, the im Graben region of Grindelwald. When Peter was born, his father (Grabi Peter) was already a certified and established mountain guide.Stevens, G. W. “Falling Stones on the Schreckhorn,” Alpine Journal (London) vol. 8 (1876-1878), p. 400. Peter's father was an active participant in the Golden Age of Alpinism (1854-1865) and climbed with mountaineers and guides such as James Robertson (1872-1932), James Surtees Phillpotts (1839-1930), Charles Pilkington (1850-1919), Richard Pendlebury (1847-1902), Peter Knubel (1832-1919), and Frederick Gardiner (1850-1919). Peter's mother, Katherina Kaufmann-Jaggi (1830-1861), who had married Grabi Peter on April 2, 1852,Ehe- Rodel für die Kirchengemeinde Grindelwald 17, 1841-1867. Staatsarchiv des Kantons Bern. Archiveinheit, pp. 119-120. died at age 31, in consequence to giving birth to her daughter, Anna. Peter was three years old, so that he hardly knew his mother. Three years later on November 25, 1864, his father, Grabi Peter, married Margaretha Baumann (born March 11, 1839 – died May 27, 1903); they had thirteen children together, and the sons—Peter's half- brothers—all became mountain guides, most notably, Christian (1872-1939) and Hans Kaufmann (1874-1930).Peter Kaufmann’s half-brothers Christian and Hans made significant contributions to mountaineering. In 1920, the Geographical Names Board of Canada, upon the earlier suggestion of James Outram in 1903, officially named a mountain (10,150/10,200 ft) with twin summits in Banff National Park as Kaufmann Peaks; the dual peaks—Christian and Hans—can be seen from a rest area on the Icefields Parkway just south of Saskatchewan River Crossing (the junction with Highway 93) in Alberta, Canada. On August 13, 1864, Christian Kaufmann and Christian Burgener had climbed the Wetterhorn with the twenty-year-old Winston Churchill. In 1901 Christian traveled to Canada for the CPR with Edward Whymper. While in Canada, he made more than 36 first ascents in the Rockies in two years (1902 and 1903) with James Outram and Norman Collie; later he climbed in the Himalayas and in Norway. Aside from a climbing career in the Bernese Oberland, Hans climbed with Christian during those days in Canada and made significant climbs in South America. Rudolf Rubi, Im Tal von Grindelwald: Vom Bergbauerndorf zum Fremdenort, II. Grindelwald: Sutter Druck AG, 1986, 216-217, 230. From an early age, Peter Kaufmann had not only herded cows and goats on steep slopes requiring a sense of balance but also learned essential climbing skills from his father, who taught him how to “read” the cliffs, the snow, the ice, and the weather. At the age of nineteen, Peter applied for a porter certificate, and, then with experienced guides, including his father, he gained practical climbing experience, which required carrying heavy loads such as provisions, ladders, and photographic gear. Climbing career (1879-1906) The 1887 photograph of the mountain guides of Grindelwald show both Peter Kaufmann, Sr. (upper left) and his son, Peter Kaufmann (lower right). They resembled each other their entire lives: Photos of Grabi Peter on left; and Peter Kaufmann on right. In March 1879, Peter Kaufmann began his own career as a certified mountain guide. He had successfully fulfilled the requirements of the licensing body for Swiss guides in Interlaken. After instruction in various matters connected with the mountains, their geography, as well as the dangers connected with snow, ice, glaciers, and rock such as “the perils of couloirs, hidden crevasses, bergschrunds, and snow bridges,”Smith, F. Ormiston. \\"The Groundmen of Europe. The Swiss Mountain Guide in the Making. . . .\\" C. B. Fry's Magazine. London, vol. 3, no. 18 (September 1905), pp. 558-569. he had been schooled in first- aid, including treatment and careful transportation of the injured. Moreover, he was expected to know how to avoid accidents and how to act prudently in the event of one. He was required “to be thoroughly acquainted with the mountains of his particular district,”Smith, p. 558. the Bernese Alps, and, in a climbing test, he had to demonstrate his knowledge of the routes, the times needed for ascents, the position of peaks and passes, the use compasses and maps, ropes and ice-picks, such as step-cutting. Moreover, he needed “to show that he had in him the makings of a complete counselor and guardian angel to the climbers under his charge,”Smith, p. 560. showing exemplary behavior at the club huts. After this rigorous training and testing, he was qualified to become an official mountain guide, so that the Governing Body of the District Authority in Interlaken certified him as a licensed guide and issued a paginated, leather-bound book (Führerbuch) in which his future clients could write their comments. As a social and professional tool, Kaufmann's business (visiting) card gives his name, his profession (in German and English), and his contact address.Spanning his 45-year career as a mountain guide, Peter Kaufmann's 224-page Führerbuch Kaufmann, Peter. Führerbuch, nach dem Reglement für die Bergführer und Träger vom 1. Mai 1874. Interlaken. 1879 [ - 1923]. A collection of testimonies written by clients for this Swiss mountain guide. 224 pages. offers a chronological list of his climbs and clients. This official leather-bound record-book, about the size of a modern paperback, contains testimonies from Peter's clients whom he guided across glaciers, over mountains, and to summits. These comments in the Führerbuch were annually reviewed for quality by an official governmental agency. The best entries give details about each climb: the routes, the mountain names, the time climbed, the weather, the guide's qualities, and the memorable occurrences. Although the entries in Führerbücher generally give positive reviews of the guide's performance, it is remarkable that every one of Peter Kaufmann's 166 reviews has a positive tone.Le Blond, Aubrey. True Tales of Mountain Adventure for Young and Old. New York: E.P. Dutton, 1903. Upon numerous occasions, Peter and his father worked together guiding climbers. For example, on August 17, 1886, they led P. Levenson (Calverley, Leeds, West Yorkshire, England) to the summit of the Schreckhorn (13,378 ft.). Mr. Levenson commented in Kaufmann's Führerbuch that “the snow was bad and we only reached the summit at 12:00. A snowstorm began at 11:30 and lasted for 24 hours, forcing us to spend the night on a narrow snow ledge on the lower arête. We reached the hut at 12 noon on August 18, having been absent 34 hours. Kaufmann was very careful & attentive & nobly assisted his father in the descent, which was very difficult owing to the fresh snow.” On January 3, 1885, Peter Kaufmann married Maria Elise von Allmen from Stechelberg. She came to Grindelwald in 1883 at the encouragement of Pastor Gottfried Strasser because of her skills in silk- weaving (Seidenweberei). She had nine children with Peter, all of whom outlived her. The identification page of his Führerbuch describes Peter as a dark-haired man about 5’ 7’’ (173 cm) tall. His clients mention his great strength and stamina. And several compliment Peter on his ability to speak English, an important skill in attracting patrons and in communicating with climbers. Some clients also said that Peter was a gracious host in the mountain huts and a good cook. During his earliest years, Peter climbed as second guide with his father (Grabi-Peter); then, as a mature adult, he guided climbers with his brothers, including his half-brothers, the twins, Rudolf and Hans (born 1874), as well as Christian Kaufmann (1872-1930). His Führerbuch makes it clear that he not only climbed the Wetterhorn (12,142 ft) and the Jungfrau (13,642 ft) more than a hundred times, but also made numerous ascents of the Schreckhorn, the Finsteraarhorn, and the Eiger (13,020 ft) as well as peaks in the Canadian Rockies and Selkirks. Peter Kaufmann with client on the summit of the Wetterhorn (ca. 1906)Generally from the upper middle classes, Kaufmann's clients came from various professions and had different reasons for climbing. Some sought adventure and wanted to prove themselves with a challenging climb or enhance their mountaineering skills; others wanted to experience the beauty and power of nature first-hand; still others were pursuing personal, professional, scientific, or photographic interests. Several prominent clients wrote testimonies into Peter Kaufmann's Führerbuch: Frank Vanderstrucken (July 1880), an American composer and conductor; William Woodman Graham (September 1887), Charles Pilkington (July 1877), and Friederick Gardiner (July 1877), accomplished mountain climbers; Arthur Wehrli (September 1899), a Swiss photographer and postcard publisher; Francis Ysidro Edgeworth (July 1891), a political economist; the Lindts (August 1888 & July 1890), chocolatiers and apothecaries from Bern; Archibald Philip Primrose (July 1900), a formerhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archibald_Primrose,_5th_Earl_of_Rosebery Prime Minister of Great Britain; Lionel de Rothschild (July 1900), a banker, politician, and zoologist; W. J. Haslam (August 1903), a headmaster of New College, Harrogate; Hugh William Acton (September 1905), a professor of tropical medicine. Daniel P. Rhodes of Boston, MA, who climbed three times with Kaufmann (in July 1899, 1900, and 1902), reaching many local summits (Wetterhorn, Eiger, Jungfrau, Finsteraarhorn, Schreckhorn, Mönch, and Vierscherhörner), described his climbs in A Pleasure-Book of Grindelwald: > “As for Peter and me, we have slept many nights on the same damp straw in a > Swiss Alpine Club-hut, and drunk from the same cup of half-frozen wine in a > chill morning wind. I have watched him by lantern-light cutting steps with > his axe in the hard ice-slopes of the Eiger; I have seen him clinging like a > fly to precipitous rock-walls, where he would eventually find a place of > safety and then pull me across at the end of the rope. When I was quite new > to the mountains, he has carefully placed my clumsy toes in little crevices > the rock which they could not find for themselves; and one day when we were > un-roped, and I was foolish enough to attempt a sitting-down glissade of a > slope of hard névé [snow melted and then frozen hard on the surface in a > crust of varying depth] he tried to throw himself in front of my body after > I had accumulated the speed of an express train.

But in justice to us both, I ought > perhaps to say that during none of our climbs has either of us been in a > precarious situation”Rhodes, Daniel P. A Pleasure Book of Grindelwald. New > York: Macmillan, 1903, p. 29. Peter Kaufmann and his wife Marie Elise had nine children: four sons (Peter, 1886-1978; Christen, 1896-1981; Hans, 1899-1996; and Fritz, 1902-1976) and five daughters (Elise, 1885-1978; Karolina, 1888-1966; Emma, 1891-1976; Marianne, 1894-1979; and Luise, 1895-1977). When his last child was born in 1902, Kaufmann purchased half of a house on the Kreuzweg in the Moosgaden region of Grindelwald. In October 1903, Peter Kaufmann's father (Grabi Peter) died in Grindelwald at the age of 71.In their book The Guiding Spirit, Revelstoke, BC: 1986, Andrew J. Kauffman & William L. Putnam erroneously state that the senior Peter Kaufmann (1850-1929, sic) visited Canada in 1903 (pp. 84 & 222). In fact, Grabi Peter (1832-1903!) never traveled to Canada and died 1903 in Grindelwald. Beat Nobs, Vom Eiger in die Rockies: Berner Oberländer Bergführer im Dienste der Canadian Pacific Railway. Bern/New York: Lang, 1987, p. 253, incorrectly attributes a visit to Canada by Peter Kaufmann (1858-1924) in 1903; in fact, Kaufmann was only there in 1907 and 1908. A third Peter Kaufmann (1886-1971), Grabi Peter’s grandson, made first ascents and joined a survey expedition with Conrad Kain to discover the source of the Columbia River in 1930. The obituary in the local newspaper described the senior Kaufmann as a tried and tested guide, who was able to follow his profession responsibly into old age. His comrades viewed him as a sincere friend and a mischievous joker, and his large family remembered him as a devoted husband and father. The obituary includes a sentimental poem, \\"Adieu to Peter Kaufmann\\" by Miriam von Kranichfeld,Miriam von Kranichfeld-Gardner and her husband admired the Alps and had settled in Grindelwald. She herself lost her sight after her husband’s death in 1896 and became a helper and friend of the blind. The Romanian Queen Elisabeth (“Carmen Sylva”) invited her to Bucharest to help establish a city for the blind, Vatra Luminoasă. Miriam died in Romania, but her remains were formally returned to Grindelwald. In 1908, four mountain guides carried her coffin to her final resting place. A gravestone in the village cemetery with a quotation by the Romanian monarch is dedicated to “her blind friend.” Rubi, Im Tal von Grindelwald II, pp. 144-145. ending with the lines, \\"So slumber on in peace, Thou Veteran of the Vale! / We triumph in thy gain, our loss alone bewail!\\" Echo von Grindelwald (October 16, 1903.) From 1903 to 1906, Kaufmann continued active climbing as a single guide or with Samuel Brawand, Christian Jossi, Peter Jaggi, and Fritz Kaufmann (his brother) as fellow guides. In January 1907, he and another guide led A. S. Wilson (from Bromley, England) on a winter ascent of the Eiger. Canadian Rockies (1907 & 1908) As Swiss mountain guides employed by the CPR, Peter Kaufmann (left) and Edward Feuz, Sr., (right) sailed aboard the S.S. Lake Champlain, crossing the Atlantic from Liverpool to Quebec (May 1908).At the turn of the century, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) began to promote tourism and climbing in the Rocky Mountains after the construction of the transcontinental railroad (1885). But the fatal accident in 1896 of Philip S. Abbot, an experienced mountaineer, made it especially important to reassure climbers that ascending mountains was safe. To encourage travel to the Rockies, CPR executives began to employ Swiss mountain guides because of their expertise and reputation as knowledgeable, careful, professional climbers. In 1903, Le Blond observed that “a skillful guide [will] find . . . an easy way up a mountain previously unexplored, while the natives of the district declare the undertaking an impossible one. The Canadian Pacific Railway Company have recognized the truth of this, and have secured the services of Swiss guides for climbing in the Rockies.”Le Blond, p. 8. Convinced to make a journey to the Canadian Rockies by fellow guide Edward Feuz, Sr., Kaufmann travelled to America in hopes of earning a good salary as a mountain guide. In the early twentieth century after the Golden and Silver Ages of Alpinism, Bernese Oberland guides—including Kaufmann—faced several difficulties finding clients: A decline in the number of English guests; a new trend to climb without guides; and an increase in competition from younger guides. So employment in Canada with the CPR offered a guaranteed income not subject to competition.Nobs, p. 245. Moreover, the trip from Grindelwald to Laggan could be accomplished in about three weeks.The continental rail journey from Grindelwald took Kaufmann to Interlaken, Thun, Basel, Luxenburg, Oostende, across the English Channel to Dover, and from there to London and finally to Liverpool. It was a 23-hour journey with at least six transfers from one railway company to another. See Nobs, pp. 127-128. Peter Kaufmann's two half- brothers, Christian and Hans Kaufmann, had already gained a reputation as guides promoting mountain climbing for the CPR. In fact, in 1901 Christian had travelled to Canada with the legendary Matterhorn mountaineer, writer, and artist Edward Whymper, to promote climbing and tourism for the CPR.Patillo, Roger. The Canadian Rockies: Pioneers, Legends, and True Tales. Victoria, BC: Trafford Publishing, 2007, pp. 245-281. Unlike some Swiss guides, who settled in Canada, the Kaufmanns—including Peter—“commuted” between Grindelwald and Rockies, leaving Switzerland in May and returning in September at the end of each climbing season. Before Peter Kaufmann arrived in Canada, there had been a scandal that surrounded Kaufmann's half-brothers (Christian and Hans) and had led to Hans's dismissal as a guide from the CPR. On July 20, 1904, Gertrude Benham (1867-1938), who was an established English climber, successfully climbed Heejee Peak with Christian Kaufmann. On the same day, Hans Kaufmann and Professor Charles Ernest Fay (1846-1931) also attempted the mountain by a more difficult route but had to abandon the climb due to snowy conditions. To honor his accomplishments, Fay, a respected mountaineer, had been promised that Heejee Peak would be named in his honor by the Geographic Board of Canada, and he wanted to be the first to climb the mountain, which was to bear his name. Fay was angered that he had been beaten to the top and suspected that the Kaufmann brothers had played a trick on him. He accused the Kaufmanns of conspiracy and demanded that the CPR fire them. Hans Kaufmann's contract was not renewed, and, at the end of the 1904 season, he ended guiding in Canada; Christian, however, continued as a guide for the CPR until the end of the 1906 season. Whether Peter's half-brothers really did conspire to deny Fay the first ascent of \\"his\\" mountain remains unclear. Edward Feuz, Jr., however, was convinced about the deception and looked at the two Kaufmann with great disfavor. But this incident tarnished neither Peter's friendship with the Feuzes nor his reputation or chances for success. In fact, Peter had been recruited by Edward Feuz and had traveled from Switzerland to Laggan with him and Edward, Jr. Furthermore, the senior Feuz had introduced Peter to Arthur Oliver Wheeler, president of the newly founded Canadian Alpine Club, recommending him for employment. Peter Kaufmann spent two seasons climbing in Alberta and British Columbia. On May 22, 1907, he sailed from Liverpool to Canada aboard the S.S. Lake Eire, arriving in Montreal ten days later on June 1. He travelled with Edward Feuz, Sr, the guide from Interlaken. The ship's manifest listed Kaufmann as “tourist” and Feuz as “guide,” since Kaufmann travelled to the Rockies for the experience and the possibility of employment as a guide without a CPR contract. Kaufmann and his companions crossed the flat Canadian prairie by rail from Montreal to Calgary in five days with major stops in Manitoba, Saskatchewan; from Calgary via Banff to Laggan (Lake Louise station) was an additional three-hour rail journey. Peter Kaufmann on the summit of Castor Peak (8282 ft.), a mountain that is part of the Asulkan (Jupiter) Group including Mts. Pollux and Lea, in British Columbia, on July 30, 1907.In July 1907, Kaufmann participated in the second annual encampment of the Canadian Alpine Club (ACC) in Paradise Valley.Wheeler, Arthur O. Diary (June 23,1907). Whyte Museum of the Canadian Rockies: Archives and Library. A.O. Wheeler fonds M546. Wheeler notes: \\". . . started for Paradise Valley . . . with Peter, along to get some information of the surroundings, [and] went to the head of the valley and found it under snow, so hard to select a camp.\\" ACC encampments enabled members, especially beginners, to attempt climbs from the foot of surrounding mountains such as Mts. Temple (11,624 ft) and Aberdeen (10,341 ft). The CPR allowed their guides, such as Edward and Gottfried Feuz, to participate in the week's activities. Kaufmann, as a friend of Feuz, and others, for example, prepared ground at the foot of Mt. Aberdeen because the meadow in the valley was so wet from heavy snow and rain. Soon, however, he began working as a guide. “Peter Kaufmann, of Grindelwald, a new Swiss guide in the Canadian Rockies, was also used during the first few days of the Camp, having been sent there to get some knowledge of the mountains in the vicinity of Lake Louise. Later, he was attached to the party of B. S. Comstock, by whom he had been retained.”Bridgland, M. P., \\"Report of the Chief Mountaineer,\\" Canadian Alpine Club Journal 1, no. 1 (1907), p. 327. In June, Kaufmann guided J. P. Forde in an unsuccessful attempt to climb Mt. Pinnacle (10,062 ft.). Climbs to the summits of Eiffel Peak (10,091 ft.), Mt. Temple (11,624 ft), and Mt. White (8,708 ft) followed. And with Lowell C. Frost (from Buffalo, New York), Kaufmann climbed Mt. Hungabee (11,450 ft.), crossed Wastach and Abbot passes, traversed several glaciers, and accomplished ascents of Mt. Victoria (11,375 ft) and Mt. Park (9671 ft).Palmer, Howard & J. Monroe Thorington, The Climbers Guide to the Rocky Mountains. New York: Knickerbocker Press, 1921, p. 61. On July 21, 1907, Kaufmann guided Benjamin S. Comstock, who was doing survey work on Mt. Sanford (11,600 ft). Comstock said that Kaufmann was one of the best Swiss guides, “having the essential of good judgment, skill and caution,” and he regarded him with “much esteem and respect personally, for his virtues of simple probity, uprightness and faithfulness to his charge and for the ever-considerate care with which he has looked after my interests.\\"Kaufmann, Führerbuch (July 21, 1907), pp. 169-170. Kaufmann returned to Europe in October 1907 aboard the S.S. Empress of Ireland from Montreal to Liverpool. Peter Kaufmann (right) with Boston attorney and American Alpine Club President Lewis Delafield (middle) at the Canadian Alpine Club encampment at Rogers Pass (July 1908). Kaufmann spent a month in the Rockies climbing with Delafield.On May 20, 1908, Kaufmann sailed to America in twelve days aboard the S.S. Lake Champlain. This time he had his own contract with the CPR, traveling with Edward Feuz, Sr., Edward Feuz, Jr., and Gottfried Feuz; the ship's manifest listed all four men as guides.Library and Archives Canada. Immigration Records. “Passenger lists of the Lake Champlain arriving in Quebec, Que. and Montreal, Que. on 1908-06-01,” item 4901, p.13. His contract with the CPR stipulated that he was hired as a mountaineering guide for service in the Rocky Mountains from May 1 until the end of the season, September 30. The company paid round-trip second-class expenses for the guide's journey as well as his board and lodging during his employment. The contract stated that the CPR reserved the right to dismiss him if he exhibited insobriety or disobedience. And, in the event of such a dismissal, he would forfeit the reimbursements of his journey home. Moreover, it stipulated that any disputes between the company and the guide would be settled by the chief Swiss Consul in Canada, whose decision would be final. Kaufmann began his 1908 stay in Canada at the third ACC encampment, this time on Rogers Pass in the Selkirk Mountains of British Columbia. In July and August, he guided clients to the summits of Mt. LeFroy (11,231 ft.), Mt. Aberdeen, Mt. Temple, Mt. Vice President, Mt. Signal 18 (a Dominion Land Survey station), and Isolated Peak. For a month, he guided Lewis Livingston Delafield (1864-1944), a New York attorney, banker, social activist, and later president of the American Alpine Club. Delafield developed a close relationship with Kaufmann: > “My object has been less to climb than to see the mountains intensely, and > Peter has seconded my efforts to do so upon very numerous expeditions from > the Chalet [at Lake Louise] and from various camps all of which have > involved ice work or rock work and some of which have required actual > climbing. I warmly commend him as a capable guide and as an agreeable > companion. He never shirks his work, and he has been most assiduous in > looking after my safety and comfort.”Kaufmann, Führerbuch (August 28, 1908), > pp. 180-181. After two years in Canada, Kaufmann did not return. Nobs observed that the Swiss guides of the older generation (born between 1850 and 1860) had difficulty adapting to the life in Canada. They were unaccustomed to travel long distances in the wilderness by horse or canoe in order to establish base camps for climbs. In addition, the accommodations for guides were usually rustic camps or basic employee quarters in hotels. And most understandably, guides with families, such as Kaufmann, became home-sick after a four-to-five month absence from wife and children.Nobs. Vom Eiger, pp.168-169. Later career (1909-1920) Peter Kaufmann (far right) leads a group of tourists across the upper Grindelwald glacier (ca. 1920)After returning to Europe in October 1908 aboard the Empress of Britain, Kaufmann continued his career as a guide to the high peaks in the Bernese Oberland. In August 1909, for instance, he and his half-brother Rudolf guided W. S. Jackson from Toronto, Canada, to the summits of the Mönch and Fiescherhorn. Jackson, who was classics professor at Upper College, had written the climbing notes on the Rockies in Baedeker's Canada (1907). In 1909, 1911, and 1913, Adolf A. Friedländer, professor of psychiatry at the Hohe Mark Klinik in Frankfurt a/M, climbed a range of mountains (Wetterhorn, Mönch, Zäsenberg, Beithorn, Jungfrau, Schreckhorn, and Finsteraarhorn) with Kaufmann; the man, who had major disagreements with Sigmund Freud, developed great respect for Kaufmann, saying he admired his first-class fortitude, caution, resolve, and confidence as a guide, whether it was in good weather or fog, rain or snow. Oskar Eliel (1878-1939), an active supporter of Jewish rights during the rise of Nazism, and his wife climbed the Wetterhorn and the Jungfrau with Kaufmann in September 1919. Peter Kaufmann on horn sled with hotel guests (ca. 1912) Aside from guiding determined and experienced mountaineers to the summits of major Bernese mountains, Kaufmann also led amateurs and tourists on less demanding adventures. He frequently led groups of 7 to 10 individuals across the upper and lower Grindelwald glaciers. One contemporary observer wrote that “the climbing of the great glacier of Grindelwald . . . is an experience that every seeker after new sensations should try.”Grieg, Kathleen, “Glacier Climbing,” The Four-Track News: A Monthly Magazine of Travel and Education 3 (December 1903), p. 353.

Gossweiler Media AG. and crossed glacial fissures for that experience of a lifetime. The upper glacier also offered the chance to enter a grotto made of blue ice, a great wonder of the time. During the winter season, Kaufmann, using the local horn-sled (Hori-Schlitten), offered sleigh rides to hotel guests, especially the elderly and disabled. Excursions to the summit of the Faulhorn (8,796 ft.) with its panoramic view was a popular destination. Although reaching the hotel on the peakWehrli, Martin. Faulhorn: Die Geschichte des Berggasthauses. Interlaken: Schamfil & Maurer, 2003. involved a strenuous but manageable four-and-a-half hour hike from Grindelwald, it was advisable to secure a guide such as Kaufmann because of the very steep slopes.\\"George Thompson, an Englishman, left the lecture at the Gletscher Hotel on June 10 [1878] intending to ascend the Faulhorn without a guide. Taking the path over Holzmatten and becoming giddy, he got into such a position in the Kniebrecher that he dared neither advance nor retreat. Here he remained five days and six nights, subsisting on such roots and herbs as he could gather. At last, growing desperate, he contrived to slide down the mountain on his back, and later on the night of the 15th crawled to the cottage of Ulrich Gertsch, near the Bussalp where he received food and shelter, and was the next day conducted to Grindelwald.\\" \\"An Alpine Adventure,\\" New York Times (August 4, 1878). Final years (1921-1924) Four months before his death, Peter Kaufmann was guiding clients to the summits of the Wetterhorn and Jungfrau (ca. 1923).During his life as a mountaineer, Peter Kaufmann was, first, an apprentice to his own father, then, a colleague to his brothers, and, finally, a teacher to his sons. Especially in the final years, he climbed with his own sons, Peter (1886-1971) and Fritz Kaufmann (1902-1978). At the age of 65, Kaufmann still received positive accolades from his clients. After a tour of the Aletsch region and a climb to the summit of the Jungfrau, J. Moret (from Wassenaar, Holland) writes that Kaufmann's “patriarchal figure guided us with youthful strength and mature caution. He was always of good cheer and ready to help, and his personality and positive outlook tremendously increased our pleasure of the tour.\\"Kaufmann, Führerbuch (August 10, 1923), p. 220. On October 14, 1924, Peter Kaufmann suffered a heart attack and died in Grindelwald at the age of 66. Pastor Martin Nil of Grindelwald officiated at the funeral, and Kaufmann was buried in the churchyard cemetery on October 21.Echo von Grindelwald (October 17, 1924).

The Tareq Rajab Museum houses a collection of over thirty thousand items collected over the last fifty years, of which approximately ten thousand are on permanent display. The museum is divided into two parts: in Area A, calligraphy, manuscripts, miniatures, ceramics, metalwork, glass, jade-, wood- and stone-carvings are exhibited. Area B contains objects which were produced in the Islamic world during the last ca. 250 years, i.e. costumes, textiles, jewellery and musical instruments. The Tareq Rajab Museum's pottery collection is very large and comprehensive, including vessels from pre-Islamic times right up to the first part of the 20th century. The earliest vessels date from the late Parthian - early Sasanian periods, while the latest ones are from Palestine, made in the 1930s. The Tareq Rajab Museum is considered the leading museum specialising in Silver Folk jewellery; it houses around 12,000 pieces in which only 2,000 are on display. The museum also has a very fine and rare collection of gold jewellery. In the Gold Room the displays go as far back as the pre Islamic period and are mainly from the Middle East although there is a section on non Islamic, Roman and Byzantine that shows the links with the Islamic Ornaments. The Tareq Rajab Museum in Kuwait has a large and important collection of Al Qur'an and manuscripts from all periods and countries (including NW China ) around the Islamic world. The museum possesses some fine examples of the writings of renowned calligraphers such as Yaqut Al Musta’simi (died 1293). Although little of his work has survived, his influence was of outstanding importance to the development of calligraphy. In contrast to the top-down approach in other Arab states of the Persian Gulf, museum development in Kuwait reflects a greater sense of civic identity and demonstrates the strength of civil society in Kuwait, which has produced many independent cultural enterprises.

At least 15 people died on both sides in the immediate border clash. It is one of a series of similar border-related incidents between the two countries. Background In February 2017, Pakistan closed the border crossings at Torkham and Chaman due to security reasons following the Sehwan suicide bombing. Hours after the blast, the Pakistan Army reportedly launched \\"strikes\\" on militant bases in Nangarhar, Afghanistan. In March, 32 days after it was closed, Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif ordered the reopening of the Afghanistan–Pakistan border as a \\"goodwill gesture\\". Subsequently, the Pakistani government decided to fence selected parts of the country's border with Afghanistan. On 5 April, an Afghan Foreign Ministry spokesman said Kabul might resort to military action if diplomacy failed to resolve the border fencing issue. The Afghanistan–Pakistan border, known as the Durand Line, runs through the Pashtun ethnic homeland, dividing the region between the two countries. Historically, the Afghan government has disputed the border and resisted attempts at border control or fencing, straining ties between both nations. The Afghan foreign ministry claimed it had also \\"warned\\" Pakistan not to conduct its census in the villages near the border area. Incident On 5 May, a Pakistani census team who were collecting population data were attacked by Afghan forces. Pakistani officials said that the fighting began after Afghan security forces fired on the census workers and the troops escorting them. The team was present in the Killi Luqman and Killi Jahangir villages, located near the border on the Pakistani side. According to Pakistan, the Afghan Border Police had been notified of the ongoing census activities in advance, but the Afghan forces began creating hurdles for them since 30 April. Samim Khaplwak, an Afghan spokesman for the governor of Kandahar, claimed that the Pakistani census team had strayed into Afghanistan. An Afghan foreign ministry spokesman claimed the villages were located in Spin Boldak District on their side of the Durand Line disputed by Afghanistan, identifying them as Loqman and Haji Nazar. He said the Afghan forces fired upon the Pakistani personnel. In return, Pakistani forces attacked the Afghan forces. On Pakistan's side, nine people, including three women and five children, were reported killed while 40 others were wounded. Afghanistan's four border guards were killed while 37 people which included 14 security forces, were injured. Two Afghan civilians were reported killed in the Pakistani shelling. The Pakistan Army said it destroyed at least five Afghan checkpoints in retaliation, killing over 50 Afghan security personnel and injuring another 100. It also said that two Pakistani soldiers were also killed and another nine were wounded. Furthermore, the military said Afghanistan asked for a ceasefire which Pakistan accepted. An Afghan government spokesman said they \\"totally rejected\\" the casualty figures by Pakistan as \\"very false\\". Afghanistan's envoy to Pakistan Omar Zakhilwal said that only two Afghan soldiers were killed and seven injured. He asserted: \\"The Chaman clash left casualties, deaths and injured on Pakistan side too but we, instead of celebrating, called it unfortunate and regrettable.\\" Reaction A spokesman for Kandahar police told Reuters that the Pakistani team were using the census as cover for \\"malicious activities and to provoke villagers against the government\\". The Inspector-General of Pakistan's Frontier Corps, Major-General Nadeem Ahmed, said that Afghan forces had intruded into Pakistani territory and taken positions by occupying houses there. He said the Afghans had targeted civilian populations and used villagers as human shields, but they retreated from their positions after Pakistani forces launched an assault. He also added that Pakistan's international border was \\"non-negotiable and no compromise will be made on it\\", and that the Afghan aggression was a result of their government's collusion with India. The commander of Pakistan Army's Southern Command, Lieutenant-General Aamer Riaz, called the Afghan offensive \\"foolish\\" and said Pakistan would respond to such attacks with \\"full might\\". In an interview with Radio Pakistan, he commented: \\"Such attacks won’t benefit Afghanistan in any way and its government should be ashamed of these imprudent actions.\\" He said the Chaman border would remain closed until \\"Afghanistan changes its behaviour.\\" Pakistan's Defence Minister Khawaja Muhammad Asif stated if Pakistan's borders were \\"violated and further destruction occurs, then those responsible will have to pay the price. We will avenge those who cause us destruction.\\" He said Afghanistan had realised it was \\"at fault\\", and that Pakistan expected to resolve the matter but it did not receive a \\"positive response\\". He also called on the Afghan government to end terrorism. Aftermath The Wesh–Chaman border crossing was closed as a result of the skirmish. The border closure resulted in the suspension of the repatriation of Afghan refugees. On 8 May, the census activities halted in urban areas of Chaman resumed. On 12 May, the border crossing was partially reopened for the women, children and sick people. The area is inhabited by Achakzai tribespeople on both sides of the border. Following the skirmish, civilians on both sides were evacuated to safer locations. In Quetta, a group of protesters staged a demonstration outside the Afghan consulate condemning the Afghan forces. Following a series of flag meetings, both sides started negotiations. It was agreed that a joint geological (sic) or geodetic survey would be carried out to demarcate the border area, and that Google Maps would be considered for this purpose. According to Dawn, the Pakistani side \\"made it clear\\" to the Afghans that the two villages affected by the incident belonged to Pakistan's side of the border. On 11 May, the completed survey reports were sent to the governments of both countries. On 27 May, Pakistan said it opened the border on \\"humanitarian grounds\\" after a request from Afghan authorities, following the start of Ramadan. This marked the end of a closure lasting 22 days.

History  The first Zeit im Bild was broadcast on December 5, 1955; two editions were broadcast that day, at 5pm and 7:30pm.http://www.arbeiter-zeitung.at/cgi- bin/archiv/flash.pl?seite=19551204_A16;html=1 The format of the bulletins was based on those at the time of the BBC, in which an in-vision presenter read out the day's news. The title Zeit im Bild (roughly, The Time in the Picture) was thought up by the TV journalist and later ORF Director General Teddy Podgorski. From February 3, 1975, the news broadcast on ORF's first TV channel (FS 1) was renamed to Zeit im Bild 1 at 7.30 pm and was supplemented by Zeit im Bild 2 on the second channel (FS 2). The two bulletins had different start times and different lengths, depending on which programmes were aired directly before said newscasts. ZiB 1 was designed from the outset as a \\"news show\\". News was mixed with entertainment, not all elements of the reporting had to be included, and instead of many brief reports, a longer and more detailed background reporting was sought. There was an overview of the news, and the \\"theme of the day\\" was then reported in more detail. ZIB 2 was presented by journalists, rather than announcers, who took a more 'hands-on' role in the newscast. Blue screen technology was also introduced in the studio. From October 22, 1979, the Zeit im Bild 1 was broadcast on both ORF channels, a practice which would remain in place until 2007. ZiB 2 was now broadcast under the broadcasting title Zehn vor zehn (Ten to Ten), running from 9:50pm to 10:20pm. In addition to the latest news, more explanatory and informative background reports were offered. Compared to the ZiB 1, there was more room for filmed reports, live interviews in the studio and outside broadcasts. There was greater use of the teleprompter among presenters, as opposed to them reading from a script. In 1984 a new newsroom was set up, where all of the editorial staff and other journalists were based, in order to allow more effective internal communication. In line with other broadcasters, bulletins were now presented only by journalists, as opposed to announcers. From March 26, 1984, Zehn vor zehn was renamed back to Zeit im Bild 2, and its airtime brought forward to 9:15pm; the newscast was shortened to twenty minutes, in order to accommodate the newly created Kulturjournal (Cultural report). A new focus of ZiB 2 became to report news that was not mentioned in the main Zeit im Bild. On September 28, 1987, the start time of ZiB 2 was changed to 10:00pm, where it remains as of 2017. In 1990 a new concept for Zeit im Bild 2 was originated: it was decided that the programme should be a mix of news, background information and lighter elements, with live reports being especially important. On January 1, 1991, ZiB 1 and ZiB 2 were renamed to Zeit im Bild, Ausgabe 19:30 (The Times in Pictures, 7:30pm Edition) and Zeit im Bild, Ausgabe 22:00 (The Times in Pictures, 10:00pm edition), in order to show that both broadcasts were of an equal importance. From 1997 to 2007, a third ZiB newscast, entitled ZiB 3, was shown daily at midnight on ORF 2; this was aimed at a younger audience.http://derstandard.at/835963/Zeit-im-Bild-3-geht- zum-1000-Mal-on-air During the terror attacks of September 11, 2001, Zeit im Bild broadcast 43 hours of uninterrupted reporting about the attack and its aftermath. On May 2, 2002, a new newsroom was put into operation, allowing journalists to file reports around the clock more easily and quickly.http://www.univie.ac.at/gonline/htdocs/upload/File/import/595.pdf Since July 5, 2004, ZiB bulletins have been available to watch throughout Europe via Astra satellite on ORF 2 Europe. Certain broadcasts, such as the morning bulletins and ZiB 2 at 10:00pm, are also shown on 3sat. = Structure until April 2007 = *Zeit im Bild 1 was broadcast at 7:30pm on ORF 1 and ORF 2 simultaneously, and was the most-watched newscast in Austria. It reported on the latest news from Austria and abroad, along with cultural reports. *ZiB 2 is broadcast on weekdays at 10:00pm on ORF 2: it is a more in-depth newscast than ZiB 1, and features many in-depth reports and interviews. At weekends a late edition of ZiB was broadcast instead of ZiB 2. *ZiB 3 was shown at midnight, also on ORF 2: its style was intended to be similar to that of newscasts from the private German broadcasters. *Short 'ZiB' bulletins are broadcast at 9am, 1pm and 5pm on ORF 2. *Short bulletins under the name Newsflash were broadcast on ORF 1 during weekday afternoons and evenings. *Special editions, known as ZiB Spezial, were broadcast during major news events. =2007 restructure onwards= In April 2007, a major overhaul of ORF's television news operation took place. The most important change, which took place after discussions in the editorial office, was ending the practice of the 7:30pm Zeit im Bild being broadcast on both ORF channels.

The ZiB 24 was taken off the programme and replaced with a shorter newscast ZiB Nacht airing for 6-8 minutes roughly around 10:30pm. *Upon the spread of Coronavirus in March 2020 and the measures imposed by the Austrian government to reduce infections, the ORF has extended the length of the ZiB1 to 35 minutes and started broadcasting it on both channels ORF2 and ORF1, replacing the ZiB 20 on ORF1. After some weeks, the broadcast was shortened to 25min, but the simultaneous broadcast on both channels and the omission of the ZiB 20 were kept in place. *For the period between the closure of schools during the Coronavirus pandemic and the start of the summer holidays, ORF1 aired a new broadcast ZiB ZACK aimed at school children. It aired 3 times on weekday mornings between 9:00am and 12:00pm and lasted for 3 minutes each. The ORF had not produced news programmes for children anymore since the station reform in 2007.

It is native to Mexico and commonly grow around 2000–3300 meters North of the 24th parallel and spreads across multiple locales. The plants grow to approximately 20–25 feet in height (can be as small as 6 feet) and 10–15 feet in width with waxy rounded-ovular leaves that have dimensions around 3-6 x 2–4 cm. The leaves are general covered in a dense layer of trichomes. The bark is scale-like and light grey; it is covered in small lenticels, allowing the plants to undergo gas exchange with the surrounding atmosphere. The twigs of the plant are covered in thick woolly hairs. Around April, the trees produce catkins that can have approximately 18 flowers are around 3-4.5 cm long. Seeing that the plants are monoecious, they also produce female reproductive organs called inflorescence. The female inflorescence generally grow around 2-4 flowers and are covered in trichomes, like the leaves of the plants. Like many more commonly known oaks, Mexican oaks utilize their male and female reproductive structures to produce the acorn nuts of the plant, which can appear alone or in clusters on small peduncles stemming from the main branches. The acorns contain a seed and eventually fall from the tree to start the growth of a new Mexican oak. La Siberia is a cultivar of this species.

He also served as the U.S. Customs and Border Protection commissioner. President Donald Trump designated McAleenan as Acting United States Secretary of Homeland Security in April 2019. He resigned on October 11, 2019, with Trump saying McAleenan wanted to \\"spend more time with his family and go to the private sector.\\" The Government Accountability Office later ruled that McAleenan's appointment as Acting Secretary had been improper. Early life Kevin McAleenan was born on September 5, 1971, in Honolulu, Hawaii, to a mother of Finnish descent and a father of Irish descent. He received an undergraduate degree from Amherst College. He then received a Juris Doctor degree from the University of Chicago Law School and practiced law in the state of California. Early career McAleenan practiced law in the private sector from 1998 until 2001, when terrorist attacks that September motivated him to apply to work for the FBI. He was recruited to help start up the new CBP Office of Antiterrorism, eventually becoming its executive director. In 2006, he became CBP's area director of Los Angeles International Airport (LAX). During his time as the port director of LAX, he was responsible for the security operations for that airport as well as 17 other airport facilities. After two years in private consulting, McAleenan returned to CBP in 2010, leading field operations. In 2011 McAleenan became the assistant commissioner of the Customs and Border Protection, Office of Field Operations. In this position he was in charge of airport operations and responsible for securing the US border while ensuring lawful trade and travel at 329 ports of entry in the United States, as well as 70 locations in more than 40 countries.

Commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection =Nomination= McAleenan served as acting commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection from January 2017 to March 20, 2018. President Donald Trump nominated McAleenan to assume the position of commissioner in a permanent capacity in May 2017. McAleenan's previous nomination was supported by officials from both the George W. Bush and the Barack Obama administrations, a number of whom signed a letter to Congress expressing \\"enthusiastic support\\" for the \\"supremely qualified\\" McAleenan. Trump officially submitted the nomination to the Senate on May 22. The Senate confirmed McAleenan's nomination on March 19, 2018, by a vote of 77–19. He was sworn in on March 20, 2018. =Tenure= In August 2018, McAleenan was interviewed by The New York Times and said he was aware that it is illegal to detain families longer than 90 days. He also said he felt Trump's executive order was an \\"important recalibration\\" and that \\"well-intended efforts are not going to succeed if they lose public interest.\\" McAleenan supports U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, saying it does \\"critical work.\\" He has said that there is no intent for indefinite or permanent family separation, and acknowledged that the CBP's job is to enforce the law. In September 2018, McAleenan told the USA Today editorial board he planned to spend more time \\"analyzing ways to modernize border patrol facilities\\" and intended to travel to the southwest United States, where most of the migrant children were being held. On June 28, 2019, McAleenan criticized media reports of conditions for detained migrants at the United States-Mexico border. He claimed that, contrary to reports, detained children had \\"appropriate meals\\" and \\"showers as soon as they can be provided.\\" But a July 2, 2019 Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report found that some detention facilities in Rio Grande Valley had violated CBP standards by not granting children access to showers or hot meals.

Trump also announced that he would name McAleenan's successor the following week; his successor, Chad Wolf, was sworn in on November 13, 2019. On August 14, 2020, the Government Accountability Office released a finding that \\"upon the resignation of Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, the express terms of the then existing designation required the Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to assume that title instead of the Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection (CBP), Kevin McAleenan.\\" The official who should have been Acting Secretary at the time of Nielsen's resignation is Director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency Christopher C. Krebs. This finding also meant that McAleenan's successor Chad Wolf and his Deputy Acting Secretary Ken Cuccinelli did not appropriately obtain their positions. Awards In 2005, McAleenan received the Service to America Medal, Call to Service Award for his leadership and help in developing and implementing a comprehensive anti-terrorism strategy for border security after September 11, 2001.

As a former councillor, he was previously leader of East Cambridgeshire District Council between May 2013 and May 2017. He was also a county councillor for the Soham and Fordham Villages electoral division of Cambridgeshire County Council between 2009 and 2017. Some of Palmer's key priorities since being elected as mayor are the construction of a metro system for Cambridgeshire, including underground tunnelling in Cambridge, upgrading the A47 in Cambridgeshire to dual carriageway, delivering Peterborough's first university with degree-awarding powers and building more affordable homes, including through community land trusts.  Early life  Palmer was born and raised in Soham, Cambridgeshire, into a farming family. He attended Soham schools St Andrews Church of England School and Soham Village College and went on to study at the Cambridgeshire College of Agriculture and Horticulture. He then worked for and ran the family dairy business, H Palmer and Sons, based in Soham.  Political career  = As a councillor = Standing for The Conservative Party, Palmer was elected as East Cambridgeshire District Councillor for the Soham North ward for the first time in 2007. He was re- elected in 2011 and 2015. He was elected as a Cambridgeshire County Councillor for the first time in 2009, in the Soham and Fordham Villages electoral division. He was re-elected in 2013. He was leader of East Cambridgeshire District Council from May 2013 until his election as Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough, when the post became automatically vacant. He also vacated his county councillor role at the same time. As leader of East Cambridgeshire District Council, he helped secure the funding for the Ely southern bypass to alleviate congestion in the city. Under his leadership the council also developed plans for £13.5 million leisure centre and a cinema complex for Ely. The new Hive Leisure Centre was opened in May 2018. He championed community land trusts as an innovative way to deliver affordable rental homes for working people whose circumstances meant they did not qualify for social housing, but were struggling to afford high private rents. = Mayoral election = Then leader of East Cambridgeshire District Council and a Cambridgeshire County Councillor, Palmer announced in December 2016 he would be campaigning to be the Conservative candidate for Mayor and was selected on 21 January 2017 following a hustings event. When he was selected he said: “The new Combined Authority has the opportunity to enhance the lives of the people in Cambridgeshire and Peterborough by investment in infrastructure, housing and skills. I am determined that, should I go forward and win the election, my vision of a strong county competing internationally with world renowned centres will be realised…Cambridgeshire and Peterborough must unite as one to provide the perfect location for international business and worldwide investment. Our competition is not Peterborough against Cambridge, but Peterborough and Cambridgeshire against California, Shanghai and Germany. Investment in any part of the county is and will be mutually beneficial.” In the immediate run-up to the election, in an interview with the Cambridge News, he said he would invest in transport infrastructure to help business growth spread across the whole of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and make job opportunities accessible to more people. He argued that a light rail metro, with underground tunnelling in Cambridge and extending to surrounding towns and business parks would improve people's ability to get around the congested area and open up its opportunities to more people. He also called for upgrades to the A10 and A47 and an extension of the M11 to link Chatteris, March and Peterborough. Palmer said that the right infrastructure would also help bring forward the housing growth Cambridgeshire urgently needed. Palmer was elected Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough on 4 May 2017 with 88,826 votes (76,064 first preferences and 12,762 transfers under the supplementary vote system in the second round), and 56.9% of the final vote. Upon being elected he said: “I am immensely proud to be the first mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough and I will do everything I can to make sure everybody is included in the future of this county.” = As Mayor of Cambridgeshire and Peterborough = Six days after being elected, Mayor Palmer announced plans for his first 100 days in office. That included the roles local council leaders would play in his cabinet and their portfolio responsibilities, as well as announcing two deputy mayors. The plan included commissioning business cases for the dualling of the A47 in Cambridgeshire, and dualling the A10 between Cambridge and Ely. The plan also included launching feasibility studies for a light rail and underground system for Cambridge and the extension of the M11 north of the city to the A47. The advancement of the next phase of the University of Peterborough, including funding, was also announced. In November 2017, Palmer joined other regional mayors to call for the UK government to allow further devolution to mayoral combined authorities. That included public services like skills, training and apprenticeships, as well as fiscal devolution to gain some control over taxes and revenues generated within combined authority areas. Palmer is currently exploring the potential for ‘Devolution 2’ to bring the health and adult social care budget for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough under the control of the combined authority, with a view to saving money and improving service delivery. Palmer is also pressing for the ability to set up Mayoral Development Corporations, a power already held by the Tees Valley Combined Authority. After concerns surfaced about the way the Greater Cambridge Greater Peterborough Local Enterprise Partnership (LEP) was being run, resulting in the Government holding back funding, Palmer wrote an open letter in September 2017 saying the organisation was no longer able to fulfil its purpose of supporting the area's business community. Palmer would later support its merging to with the Combined Authority, where it was proposed to operate under an independent Business Board. The Business Board, he said, “will involve the public and private sectors working together closely will provide a powerful business voice for Greater Cambridgeshire and Peterborough.\\" Among Palmer's key priorities as Mayor has been to progress with work on delivering a metro system in Cambridgeshire, with underground tunnelling in Cambridge city centre. Due to the significant estimated cost, the Mayor is looking at financing through land value cap and tax increment financing (TIF) and significant investment from the private sector. The uplift in value of land caused by new transport links is capped, with a proportion of that value going to finance the infrastructure scheme itself. In March 2018 Palmer announced he would be supporting the A47 Alliance campaign for full dualling of the trunk road from the A1 near Peterborough to Lowestoft in Suffolk. The dualling of the A10 from Cambridge to Ely, and the eventual extension of the M11 north to the A47 to better connect the north and south of Cambridgeshire are also ongoing road priorities. His rail priorities include establishing a rail link for Wisbech, building a station at Soham and delivering an interim station at Cambridge South by 2021, years ahead of the proposed 2025-27 timescales for the full station, as proposed via East-West Rail. Palmer argues that better transport links will also help ease the housing crisis because people will be able to live and work in a greater variety of locations. Palmer also wants to significantly accelerate the delivery of affordable housing across the area. He is heavily in favour of community land trusts, a relatively new idea, to help build more affordable homes across Cambridgeshire and Peterborough. Since his election, Palmer has also campaigned to reform the region's education system and for further devolution from Westminster.  Personal life  In 2018 Palmer marked 25 years of marriage and has two children with his wife. A football fan, he has been a lifelong supporter of Tottenham Hotspur and is a season ticket holder. His cousin is the Burnley FC and England international goalkeeper Nick Pope.

He reports that his twins are “doing fine,” and he hopes to prevent medical errors like theirs by sharing their story. Quaid’s speech at a National Press Club event is presented in which he states that “the real sweet spot or safety envelope for high-performance care is the intersection of three systems: leadership, safe practices, and technology. When these support systems are functioning within the right organizational culture, we get great care and we get safe care.” National network news video of interviews of Quaid on CNN, MSNBC, and CSPAN are included in the film. =Chasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare harm= The documentary references the made for television documentary also broadcast globally in the Discovery Channel, Chasing Zero: Winning the War on Healthcare Harm which used hospital accidents to focus a lens on leaders in healthcare reducing preventable medical error rates to zero. The documentary captures segments of Chasing Zero filmed around the globe at locations including Geneva, Switzerland; London, England; Hawaii; the Brigham and Women’s Hospital; the Cleveland Clinic; Vanderbilt University Medical Center; Johns Hopkins; and the Mayo Clinic. =Eric Cropp and the Death of Emily Jerry= The film covers the death of a 2-year-old girl killed by a preventable and accidental lethal injection of a salt solution during cancer treatment. The father of the child who died, Christopher Jerry, sat with the pharmacist convicted of manslaughter in the death of Emily Jerry, and forgave him on camera. They pledged to work together to prevent this type of error from happening again. =Communicating with the News Media= The documentary examines the difficulty the producers had in their efforts to bring attention to system errors in healthcare by showing a clip from their appearance on the MSNBC show Morning Joe on April 22, 2010. Joe Scarborough attempted to enforce the message that you can not trust healthcare providers by asking, “you’ve got to be very skeptical of every doctor and every nurse? You don’t want to get in the way of what they’re doing, but you just can’t take their word for it anymore, can you?” But the data shows that systems errors are the cause of harm, not individuals. =I Love Lucy’s Famous Chocolate Film Scene= Surfing the Healthcare Tsunami used the scene from the September 15, 1952 episode of I Love Lucy, Job Switching , as a metaphor for how systems can cause well- meaning and competent caregivers to make errors. In the scene, Lucy and Ethel attempt to keep up with an unmanageable pace of chocolates coming off of an assembly line. When they do well, the manager increases the speed, forcing them to hide their errors. In turn, the manager thinks they can handle the increased speed and increases the speed again, leading to more failures in their work. As Dr. Thomas J. Lee notes, “Lucy and Ethel must feel the way that contemporary employees feel as they are constantly pushed to produce more and perform better without adequate or appropriate training, support, or understanding.”http://rainbows.typepad.com/blog/2011/04/leadership-lessons-of- i-love-lucy-lucille-ball-arceil-thomas-j-lee-communication-candor- collaborate-.html This scene has been used in healthcare to represent what happens to frontline healthcare workers, resulting in medical errors. =Global Crisis= The documentary recognized the global impact of medical errors by sharing that in hospitals across Western Europe, North America, and Australia, the chances of being subjected to a medical error in hospital is 1 in 10. The chances of dying from an error is 1 in 300, according to Sir Liam Donaldson of the World Health Organization. =Aviation Safety and Healthcare Comparisons= The documentary interviews several notable people in aviation including Chesley Sullenberger and John J. Nance. They recount that aviation saw that they had system errors that would doom the industry, the industry got together to fix the problems by forming the private-public joint task force, Commercial Aviation Safety Team (CAST). In healthcare, there are 440,000 people dying in the US annually from medical error, making it the third leading cause of death. =Story Power= The film introduces the concept of Story Power, using patient stories to engage the hearts and minds of medical professionals to change the way they deliver care for the better. This concept is based on the Journal of Patient Safety article, Story Power: The Secret Weapon by Dennis Quaid, Julie Thao, and Dr. Charles Denham. This section features Patient Safety Advocate and Author, Regina Holliday who encourages patient advocates and healthcare providers to engage patients and their families in dialogue about solutions for healthcare.

Pretas Simoa focuses on empowering Afro-Brazilian women by reclaiming the black woman’s historical and contemporary representation in Brazilian society. They are active in deconstructing the hyper-sexualization of black women in the media and everyday life. Additionally, Pretas Simoa seeks to discover the omitted history of black women in both contemporary and historical resistance. Pretas Simoa’s hope in rewriting Afro-Brazilian women as protagonist rather than sidenotes or victims in their own history is to “strengthen the bonds of their own identity”. :More recently in a statement entitled \\"From the slave quarters to the post card: My flesh is not of your Carnival\\", Pretas Simoa speaks out on the hyper-sexualization of black women and the term “mulatta” during the Carnival season. Pretas Simoa calls out the hypocrisy of the media during this time, in which the media ecstatically looks for black (light skinned) women to fill the role of the Globeleza, a woman who dances samba in body paint advertising the Carnival season. Pretas Simoa calls out this hypocrisy, because it is only during this season of fiesta that black women receive glorification and praise in the media. Outside of Carnival season, black women are either ignored by the media, not represented in the media or depicted as slaves or domestic workers. Pretas Simoa also discusses the psychological and violent impact the hyper-sexualization of black women has on black women’s daily lives. In their statement they declare “This violence is of a moral order, as it slanders us and hurts our honor and reputation; it’s physical in jeopardizing the integrity of our body as we are seen as “available”; and also psychological, as it implies directly the perception that we have of ourselves and interfere with our affectionate and sexual behavior that sustains this cruel hyper-sexualized identity in which we are seen and often ends up implicated in the reflection that we see in the mirror”.Simoa, Preta. \\"From the slave quarters to the tourist post card: “Remove your labels from my black body!”.\\" Black Women of Brazil.

The goal in holding this demonstration was to highlight the way black women’s dual identities as black and women intersect to create dual oppression, different from that of the predominately white feminists at Marcha das Vadias. During the demonstrations women chanted things such as “Claudie Ferreria resists”, referring and standing in solidarity to the black woman who was murdered and then dragged on the street attached to a Military Police Van in Rio de Janeiro. In addition to the chants, phrases such as “This is not an invitation”, were written on the bodies of the demonstrators to protest sexual abuse and sexism against black women. :The protest proceeded to divide into two locations, at a Women’s Police Station and Cidade Baixa. At the Women’s Police Station, the focus was violence against women perpetuated by the police. Open letters with demands, such as better service conditions at the station, increased vacancies in shelters for female victims of violence and violence prevention programs. Protesters as well laid in the street to symbolically depict the systemic violence against black women in Brazil. The sector of the protest that continued to Cidade Baixa, marked the pavement with graffiti at places where sexist, racist and homophobic events occurred. One of the demonstration stops were at Pingium bar in which protesters booed the bar, kissed, and burned the entrance carpet along with their bras. = Marcha das Mulheres Negra = The Marcha das Mulheres Negra, which translates to the Black Women's March, took place on November 18, 2015. Marcha das Mulheres Negra gathered more than 10,000 black women from all socioeconomic backgrounds, ranging from domestic workers to politicians and professors. This march was the first ever national Afro-Brazilian women's march in the Brazil. Together the women marched against poverty, violence, and racism. Slogans such as “I do not accept my place in the kitchen” and “I want to be in the revolution” were chanted.\\"Marcha das Mulheres Negras: The Radical and Feminist Act of Reclaiming Space and Re-writing the Narrative.\\" AWID.

Major highways and streets of the city were cut off and blocked by protesters. These actions were symbolic of black women reclaiming space for themselves outside of the periphery of Brazilian society. After the march, a group of protesters met with the president and Nilma Lino Gomes, Brazil's minister of women, racial equality and human rights. Ivana Braga, an organizer for the march had this to say “As we leave this march, I know that the black woman’s fight in Brazil is stronger... We won’t be as invisible any more, and our concerns and needs will start to be addressed on the political agenda.” Freelon, Kiratiana. \\"Fighting Poverty, Plagued by Violence: Why 10,000 Black Women in Brazil Marched for Their Rights.\\" The Root.

Violence against white women in the same 10-year period decreased 18 percent.” Additionally, of the 60,000 homicides in Brazil each year, more than 40,000 are Afro-Brazilian, meaning black women are losing their family members at a higher rate than white women, and thus suffering greater rates of psychological and emotional trauma than their white women counterparts. :According to Newsweek’s Why the Progress Made by Brazil’s Activists Might Now Unravel, “16 percent of the killings in Rio over the last five years, and from 2010 to 2013, 79 percent of those victims were black”.

In his 1935 book Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache; Einführung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv, Fleck identified the scientific production of knowledge as primarily a social process that hinges upon prior discoveries and practices in a way that constrains and preconditions new ideas and concepts. He termed this shared collection of preexisting knowledge a \\"Denkstil\\" or thought style and formulated a comparative epistemology of science using these two ideas.  Genesis and Development of a Scientific Fact  Ludwik Fleck, a Polish and Israeli physician and biologist working during the 20th century, developed an idea of scientific knowledge creation as being primarily a social practice dependent on the cultural and historical practices within which researchers find themselves. He elaborated this idea with a series of examples in the 1935 essay Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache, together with a book of the same name, however, his ideas went largely unnoticed until Thomas Kuhn's rediscovery of them in the 1960s.Fleck, Ludwik. Entstehung Und Entwicklung Einer Wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einführung in Die Lehre Vom Denkstil Und Denkkollectiv. Basel: B. Schwabe, 1935. Print. Within the text, Fleck uses the identification of syphilis in the late-1800s and early-1900s as an example of a scientific fact that was supremely conditioned by the historical and social context in which it was discovered. He likens the statement that a scientific fact has been ascertained to a statement of the type \\"'someone recognizes something,'\\" a statement meaningless without further context. He continues the example to state that just as the sentence \\"'Town A is situated to the left of town B'\\" is incomplete without an observational reference frame, such as \\"'to someone walking on the road from town C to town B,'\\" so too is a scientific discovery incomplete without considerations of the social practices that condition it. Fleck's goal for this discussion was to situate the discovery of new scientific facts, a form of epistemological cognition, within the greater environment of knowledge that encompasses them. He promotes with the idea of the \\"Denkkollektiv\\" the tenet that any discovery is an interaction between at least three things, namely the discovered phenomenon, the discoverer, and the existing pool of knowledge from which they draw. By interacting socially in their production of knowledge, researchers produce common concepts and practices that they use to discuss and debate one another's ideas and discoveries.Brorson, Stig, and Hanne Andersen. “Stabilizing and Changing Phenomenal Worlds: Ludwik Fleck and Thomas Kuhn on Scientific Literature.” Journal for General Philosophy of Science / Zeitschrift Für Allgemeine Wissenschaftstheorie, vol. 32, no. 1, 2001, pp. 109–129., www.jstor.org/stable/25171193.Stump, David. “The Role of Skill in Experimentation: Reading Ludwik Fleck's Study of the Wasserman Reaction as an Example of Ian Hacking's Experimental Realism.” PSA: Proceedings of the Biennial Meeting of the Philosophy of Science Association, vol. 1988, 1988, pp. 302–308., www.jstor.org/stable/192997. These common concepts and practices both provide a shared language of science within which they can communicate, and consequently limit the possibilities of thought that the researchers can have. Under the influence of a particular \\"thought style,\\" the common concepts and practices previously mentioned, a community of researchers \\"shares joint attributes of problems and judgments considered as evident, joint methods to acquire knowledge, and agrees in the determination of meaningless questions.\\"Forstner, Christian. “The Early History of David Bohm's Quantum Mechanics Through the Perspective of Ludwik Fleck's Thought-Collectives.” Minerva, vol. 46, no. 2, 2008, pp. 215–229., www.jstor.org/stable/41821460. Within this conception of the production of scientific knowledge, the ideas, concepts, and theories of these researchers are permanently conditioned by their present \\"thought style\\" and cannot be considered independently of them. As a result of his formulation of the thought style and thought collective concepts, Fleck attempted to situate the individual scientific discoverer within the system of individuals that compromise the community of interacting researchers. To this end, he maintained that the individual's only contribution to the production of new knowledge is the determination of results that follow from established conceptual preconditions. As he states, \\"the preconditions correspond to active linkages and constitute that portion of cognition belonging to the collective.\\" The ascertaining of scientific knowledge as such is a result of connections between concepts and ideas that are laid out by the community of researchers, laying the groundwork from which individual researchers can draw their conclusions. Just as a soccer player makes little progress in a game without their interactions among a cooperating team, an individual researcher is lost without the thought collective that shapes their approach to scientific practice. Extending this analogy, ideas and concepts exchange between individuals in the thought collective like passes in a soccer match, each time gaining new directions and a change in momentum. With the greater collective and style of practice taken into account, scientific discoveries can be considered as communal social products influenced by the particular milieu that surrounds them.

Education  Donnelly received her B.S. from the University of Vermont after attending school there from 1974-1978. Her degrees include a M.S. and Ph.D. in food science, both from North Carolina State University, specializing in food microbiology.  Career  Donnelly joined the faculty of the University of Vermont in 1983. At that time, a large outbreak of illness caused by a relatively unknown bacterium, Listeria monocytogenes, occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. Donnelly’s laboratory began research on this dangerous foodborne pathogen. She developed procedures for detection of Listeria in food, resulting in UVM medium, used by the USDA as part of its official meat testing program. Donnelly worked collaboratively with the FDA in refuting theories that Listeria could survive pasteurization. She lectured extensively on the topic of Listeria at a time of crisis for the dairy industry, and has continued to give lectures on Listeria around the globe. From 1988-1998, Donnelly served as the Associate Dean of the College of Agriculture and Life Sciences at the University of Vermont, and served as Interim Dean from 1998-1999. Donnelly served as a member of the National Advisory Committee on Microbiological Criteria for Foods from January 1999 to 2005, being appointed initially by President Clinton and later reappointed by President Bush. In January 1999 she was appointed to the Science Advisory Board to the FDA's National Center for Toxicological Research. Donnelly developed an interest in artisan cheese and controlling the threat of Listeria contamination in artisan cheese. In 2004, she and her colleague Paul Kindstedt became co-directors of the Vermont Institute for Artisan Cheese (VIAC) at UVM, an organization that provided education to over 1500 individuals from 48 states and 13 countries. Through VIAC, Donnelly was able to collaborate with cheese scientists from around the globe on issues concerning cheese safety. Her book Cheese and Microbes (ASM Press, 2014), provided insight into the microbiological complexities of cheese as a living food. Donnelly also served as Editor-in- Chief of The Oxford Companion to Cheese (Oxford University Press, 2016), where she was responsible for overseeing 325 contributing authors from 35 countries. The Companion received a James Beard Award for Reference and Scholarship in 2017, and was a finalist for the André Simon Food Book Award the same year. Donnelly received the Maurice Weber Laboratorian Award from the International Association of Food Protection in 2006 in recognition of her outstanding laboratory contributions related to Listeria. In 2011, she was named a Fellow of the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT). Donnelly served as the Scientific Editor of the \\"Microbiology and Safety\\" section of IFT’s Journal of Food Science from 2006-2016. Donnelly has challenged the FDA in its approach to regulation of use of raw milk in cheesemaking. She had a cameo appearance in Netflix's documentary adaptation of Michael Pollan’s book Cooked. In 2019, her book Ending the War on Artisan Cheese was nominated for the Bookseller/Diagram Prize for Oddest Title of the Year.

The dojo was founded by Bill Viola Sr., who the Heinz History Center references as a co-creator of the modern sport of mixed martial arts. The school is currently located in Irwin, Pennsylvania, North Huntingdon Township and operates under the name \\"Viola Karate.\\" History The name \\"Allegheny\\" represents the school’s first location in Allegheny County (East Allegheny School District), located in the Greater Pittsburgh area. Shotokan is the base style of Japanese Karate taught with an emphasis on mixed martial arts and kickboxing. The dojo was founded on the traditional principles of the Japan Karate Association (JKA) and later became affiliated with Robert Trias and George Anderson under the United States Karate Association. Competition USA Karate team members Jack Bodell, Richard Sowash, and Doug Selchan began their training at the school. Selchan went on the win a Gold Medal the 1999 Pan-American Games for the United States. Bodell later became a member of the United States Secret Service responsible for the protection of President Jimmy Carter. In 1998, the school was honored by Arnold Schwarzenegger as the top Martial Arts team in the United States at the Arnold Sports Festival. Positive Athlete Pittsburgh has also honored Allegheny Shotokan karate members with the Hines Ward Positive Athlete Award for martial arts. The school is home to Team “Kumite,” an all-star competition team coached by Bill Viola Jr. Mixed martial arts In the 1970s, Allegheny Shotokan established open “fight nights” at its Pennsylvania Turtle Creek dojo. Students from various styles of martial arts were invited to train together and share knowledge in what was called “combined fighting” and the workouts attracted local judo, jujutsu, wrestling, kung fu, boxing, kickboxing and karate instructors. The collaboration inspired modern day mixed martial arts at the Tough Guy Contest, founded by the school's parent company, CV Productions, Inc. Viola enlisted his students Jack Bodell and PKA Heavyweight kickboxing champion Jacquet Bazemore as referees for the Tough Guy Contest. A series of mock mixed martial arts bouts took place at the Allegheny Shotokan dojo to practice the rules and regulations of the new sport. On March 20, 1980, Allegheny Shotokan Karate member Dave Jones of Irwin, Pennsylvania represented the school in the first Tough Guy Contest by recording a TKO victory over Mike Murray of Vandergrift in the 3rd round. The sport was banned in 1983 with the passage of the Tough Guy Law. The Heinz History Center Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum, in conjunction with the Smithsonian Institution, unveiled an exhibit on June 23, 2011, documenting the first mixed martial arts league in the United States. The display included recognition of Allegheny Shotokan Karate. Bill Viola Sr., Jack Bodell, Jacquet Bazemore and Dave Jones' influence on mixed martial arts is recognized in the book, Godfathers of MMA.

It is named after the Gamssulzen Cave in Austria, where the holotype of this species was found.Gernot Rabeder (2004): Die Höhlenbären der Sulzfluh-Höhlen, Vorarlberger Naturschau 15, Seite 103–114  Description  Ursus ingressus was a large cave bear with massive, bulky limbs. It was larger than Ursus spelaeus, which has been estimated to weigh an average of (male specimen).Per Christiansen (1999): What size were Arctodus simus and Ursus spelaeus (Carnivora: Ursidae)?, Finnish Zoological and Botanical Publishing Board, Helsinki 1999  Behaviour  Some studies have suggested the Gamssulzen Cave bear to have been herbivorous, living of vegetation with little contribution of grass. Other studies proposed Ursus ingressus to have been an omnivore, with participation of terrestrial and more likely aquatic animal protein, that exceeds the participation of animal protein in the diet of the modern brown bear (Ursus arctos). However it has also been suggested, that the feeding habits of cave bears can vary heavily depending on the environment. Skulls with bite damage from Zoolithen Cave in Germany suggest that Ursus ingressus came into conflicts with other big carnivores of the Late Pleistocene of Europe like the cave lion (Panthera leo spelaea) or the cave hyena (Crocuta crocuta spelaea).  Distribution and habitat  It has been suggested that the Gamssulzen Cave bear dominated Ursus spelaeus in Central and Eastern Europe, while being out- competed by this species in Western Europe. Around 50,000 years ago, the Gamssulzen Cave bear migrated into the Alps and replaced two former populations of Ursue spelaeus: Ursus spelaeus eremus and Ursus spelaeus ladinicus. Ursus ingressus has been found as far east as the Ural Mountains in Russia and as far west as the Swabian Jura in Germany. It has mostly been found in medium and high elevated regions and probably was adapted to continental environments with cold and arid climate.Baca, Mateusz, Stankovic, Anna, Stefaniak, Krzysztof, Marciszak, Adrian, Hofreiter, Michael, Nadachowski, Adam, Węgleński, Piotr, and Mackiewicz, Paweł. 2012. Genetic analysis of cave bear specimens from Niedźwiedzia Cave, Sudetes, Poland. Palaeontologia Electronica Vol. 15, Issue 2;21A,16p  Evolution and extinction  Ursus ingressus and Ursus spelaeus evolved from Ursus deningeri and probably diverged between 173,000 and 414,000, or possibly as much as 600,000 years ago. Some studies still question whether U. ingressus and U. spelaeus are separate species, instead treating them as subspecies of a single species. The Gamssulzen Cave bear survived U. spelaeus for about 1000 to 2000 years, locally replacing this species, but also became extinct about 30,000 years ago, just prior to the Last Glacial Maximum. The reasons for their extinction are still being discussed, with climate change and human hunting suggested as possible reasons.

Miller, in his book Sound Unbound: Sampling Digital Music and Culture, described the title track as demonstrating \\"moody and tender writing at its best\\". A detailed review by the website Ambient Exotica contrasted the album to Riddle's earlier water themed Sea of Dreams and wrote that \\"The most glaring example for the different soundscapes between both albums are the instruments that are neglected on the first work, but added in the latter: vibraphones, harps, pianos and bongos altogether lessen the romantic notions in Love Tide, but cannot leave an impact once the melodrama and yearning are aurally displayed via the many violin strings. ...And since Riddle occasionally breaks the overarching concept that is thrown at him by the marketing people at Capitol, you should not expect an adamant frame that solely focuses on the loving couple of the front cover, let alone the liquedous setting. That's actually great, for it is these formula-expanding moments where the album starts to get interesting for Exotica followers, regardless of whether they are fans of Nelson Riddle or not.\\"AmbientExotica.com – Music Reviews of Ambient, Vaporwave & Tiki Exotica Albums: 146 – Nelson Riddle – Love Tide - AmbientExotica.com – Music Reviews of Ambient, Vaporwave & Tiki Exotica Albums, accessdate: May 5, 2017 Track listing # \\"Bali Ha'i\\" (Richard Rodgers, Oscar Hammerstein II) – 3:17 # \\"Ill Wind\\" (Harold Arlen, Ted Koehler) – 2:57 # \\"East of the Sun (and West of the Moon)\\" (Brooks Bowman) – 2:16 # \\"Till the End of Time\\" (Buddy Kaye, Ted Mossman) – 2:30 # \\"Caravan\\" (Duke Ellington, Irving Mills, Juan Tizol) – 2:39 # \\"Sweet Leilani\\" (Harry Owens) – 3:10 # \\"Take Me In Your Arms\\" (Fred Markush, Mitchell Parish) – 3:10 # \\"Solitude\\" (Ellington, Eddie DeLange, Mills) – 3:37 # \\"Santana\\" (Jimmy Rowles, Nelson Riddle, Ted Satterwhite) – 2:25 # \\"Honeysuckle Rose\\" (Andy Razaf, Fats Waller) – 2:46 # \\"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me\\" (Harry Noble) – 2:30 # \\"Love Tide\\" (Lee Gillette, Riddle) – 2:23 Personnel *Nelson Riddle – arranger References External links * Category:1961 albums Category:Albums arranged by Nelson Riddle Category:Capitol Records albums Category:Instrumental albums Category:Nelson Riddle albums ","title":"Love Tide"},{"id":"53968553","title":"New Land (song)"},{"id":"53968564","text":"Club de Fútbol Nules is a Spanish football club based in Nules, Province of Castellón.

He was named Governor in December 2016 and member of the Bank's Board from October 2015. He has been a close collaborator to the governments of the left-center Concertation of Parties for Democracy (1990-2010), and for six years held the position of Budget Director, where he played a key role in the design of the structural surplus rule. Linkedin Chile’s President Appoints Mario Marcel as Head of Central Bank Chilean government names economist Mario Marcel new central bank president. Reuters Early years He studied at the Instituto Nacional General José Miguel Carrera high school in Santiago El viaje de estudios de Mario Marcel, Qué Pasa magazine (in spanish) and Business Administration at the University of Chile (1977-1981), where he graduated as the best student of his class. Later on he achieved a PhD degree in economics at the University of Cambridge, United Kingdom.Biography Mario Marcel in Central Bank of Chile He was the first member of his family to achieve a university degree. His mother and grandparents arrived to Chile by ship on 18 September 1937, escaping the Spanish Civil War. His parents had to abandon their study projects in order to work and financially sustain their families. His father set up a small electric appliances enterprise in the early seventies. He joined the Center for Latin American Studies (Cieplan) as a junior researcher in 1979, while still a university student. He then progressed as assistant, associate and finally senior researcher.  Career  =Administrations of presidents Patricio Aylwin and Eduardo Frei (1990-2000)= Upon Patricio Aylwin’s arrival at the Presidency of the Republic in March 1990, and Alejandro Foxley at the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Marcel joined the Government as Advisor on macroeconomics and social programs, later assuming the position of Deputy Budget Director. In 1994, with Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle in the Presidency, he was appointed Executive Secretary of the Inter-Ministerial Committee for the Modernization of Public Administration.Biography in Central Bank of Chile At the end of 1996, he took office as Interim Director of the Budget Division (Dipres), when the incumbent, José Pablo Arellano —with whom he has a long-lasting friendship— was appointed Minister of Education. Between October and December he led the approval processing of the Budget Law; promoted the first protocol of budgetary agreements between the Government and the Congress; and laid the foundations for the public sector management control system that would be developed in the following years.La Tercera (Santiago), 2 July 2000, Reportajes, p.20 Between 1997 and 2000, he was Executive Director for Chile at the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). In the United States, he strengthened his relationship with Nicolás Eyzaguirre (then at the IMF), with whom he had worked in the early eighties in the Association of Socialist Economists. Here he also approached Michelle Bachelet, who was then attending at Fort Leslie, the Inter-American Defense University. During this period he was chairman of the IDB’s Budget Committee and led the formulation of this international organization’s first Institutional Strategy. He served as the Deputy Director for Public Governance and Territorial Development at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). He also previously worked at the Inter-American Development Bank where he was Executive Director for Chile and Ecuador and Manager of the Institutional Capacity and Finance. http://blogs.worldbank.org/es/team/mario-marcel He served as Deputy Director of Rationalization and Public Function in the Budget Division of the Finance ministry of the Chilean government, Executive Secretary for the Inter- Ministerial Committee for the Modernization of Public Administration, Chair of the General Government’s Internal Audit Committee and Chair of the Presidential Advisory Committee on Pension Reform. He was the Budget Director from 2000 to 2006. =Administrations of Ricardo Lagos and Michelle Bachelet (2000-2010)= In 2000, the incoming President, Ricardo Lagos, appointed him as Budget Director, and Nicolás Eyzaguirre as Minister of Finance. Marcel is recognized as one of the ideologues of the 1% of GDP structural surplus rule, because before assuming, he had conducted a study on the methodology for calculating long-term fiscal indicators. The rule has been applied since 2001 in order to spend what is considered stable income over time, once adjusting by the effects of the business cycle on fiscal income. While in office, he promoted far-reaching reforms in the conduct of fiscal policy; the administration of public assets and liabilities; the budgetary system; and the public management. Despite being a serious candidate to become Minister of Finance under President Michelle Bachelet in January 2006, he was not the nominee. Nevertheless, Ms. Bachelet appointed him to lead the commission that studied changes to the local pension system, one of the main guidelines of her government program as a candidate. The recommendations of the “Marcel Commission” laid the foundations for the Pension Reform approved in 2008. After completing this work, he resumed his private consultancy role. Between 2006 and 2008, he worked as a senior researcher at Cieplan, professor at the University of Chile, director of the firms Transelec and Aguas Metropolitanas, and as international consultant for Mexico, El Salvador and Vietnam. =International Work and Board Member of the Central Bank (2008-)= Mario Marcel with IMF Managing Director 218x218px In 2008, he assumed management of the IDB’s Department of Institutional Capacity and Finance in Washington D.

Biologist Julian Huxley wrote a foreword to the book.Anonymous. (1959). The Psychology of the Occult. Science Digest 46: 194. Content The book takes influence from the works of Frank Podmore, Joseph Jastrow and Ivor Lloyd Tuckett dealing with the \\"fallacies underlying psychical research\\". Rawcliffe critically examines claims of the occult, parapsychology and spiritualism concluding that they are best explained by psychological factors such as hallucination, hysteria, neurosis and suggestion as well as \\"delusion, fraud, prestidigitation, and limitless credulity.\\"Tulving, Endel. (1960). Review of Illusions and Delusions of the Supernatural and the Occult. Canadian Journal of Psychology 14 (4): 286–287. Rawcliffe found possible naturalistic explanations for all parapsychological experiments he investigated, noting that there is no scientific evidence for any paranormal power. He suggested that many of the results from ESP experiments can be explained by what he termed endophasic enneurosis (unconscious whispering).Dingwall, Eric. (1952). Psychical Research Dissected. Nature 170: 176–177. The book offers rational explanations for diverse phenomena such as automatic writing, dowsing, fire-walking, lycanthropy and stigmata. Reception Daniel Loxton has described the book as an important skeptical work written many years before the founding of CSICOP.

History White's Hall was originally part of an 1,800-acre land grant to Colonel Jerome White in 1665. The house itself was constructed between 1784 and 1792. The home was designed as a two-story, brick side passage double pile plan dwelling, and was listed on the Maryland Historic Site inventory in 1969.

Today, the previous manor house is surrounded by residential development and the Walden Golf Club. =Demolition or restoration= In 2016, Millersville-based housing developer Polm Companies planned to demolish the historic home for additional space for residential lots. Its potential demolition galvanized an effort by preservation and historic activists, who worked with the developer in an effort to save the mansion.

Still without a buyer in 2017, plans have been called to re-purpose and retrofit the structure into a museum, restaurant, and inn.

It is recognized as a tax-exempt 501(c)(3) organization by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service. The Johns Hopkins House, Inc., is operating under a rent-to-own agreement from Polm.

Active as a performing musician since the mid-1960s, Caldirola was initially a member of various teenage rock ‘n’ roll bands during the Pacific Northwest's “Louie Louie” era. By the 1970s his songwriting talent was flourishing and various other artists began recording his songs. In an effort to score a record deal he cut an album's worth of tunes that represented the full range of his abilities – songs that touched on the rock, psych, soul, funk, country and pop genres. thumb Dennis the Fox \\"Mothertrucker\\" LP Musart Records MA801 Released as an independent DIY project on an obscure Seattle-based label, his Mothertrucker LP was released in 1972 to no great fanfare, and basically sank without a trace. Meanwhile, Caldirola simply carried on with his life. He played in other bands, worked in the music biz as a professional song plugger, penned songs that were recorded by various artists, and held other entertainment industry management-level jobs. In the meantime, whole new generations of music fans, vintage vinyl collectors – and eventually hip-hop DJs – discovered that old Mothertrucker album and found some of the funk grooves to be phat. In recent years the LP has gained a robust cult following and various songs on it have been sampled for other artists’ recordings, and included in a CD/book set (Enjoy The Experience – Homemade Records 1958-1992), as well as on numerous compilation discs. The original Mothertrucker album has become a valuable and highly sought-after collector's item, and was finally reissued on vinyl by Modern Harmonic records in 2017. Early life and career Born in Miles City, Montana on March 22, 1948, to a native Italian father (Carlo Caldirola) and an Irish-American mother (Della Floyd). While an infant the Caldirola family moved to Seattle's Italian-dominated neighborhood – “Garlic Gulch” – in the Rainier Valley area just east of Beacon Hill, young Dennis was raised bilingually, and the Caldirolas were warmly welcomed into the community. Caldirola started learning piano in first grade, and later while in high school in the summer of 1964 he helped form a band, the Rum Runners, that played teen dances around town, and fabled rooms including Parker's Ballroom and the Lake Hills Roller Rink. Their biggest gig was opening up for British rock group, the Yardbirds, at the Eagles Auditorium on July 30, 1967. The group broke up in September 1968 when Caldirola opted to move on from Seattle University and continue his college studies in Florence, Italy. Then, upon his return, Caldirola played the Hammond organ with HUGG, a band that had been around since 1968. He performed with them into 1971 when he committed himself to becoming a genuine rock star and began focusing on writing original material. 1971--72: Mothertrucker By 1971 Caldirola was associating with Dave Clark – a local businessman who began serving as his de facto manager. Together they concocted a plan aimed at scoring Caldirola a recording contract and setting him on the path to fame and fortune. The first step was dropping his mouthful-of-a-birth-name, and adopting the stage-name, “Dennis The Fox.” Next, they corralled a bunch of top Seattle musicians including: Robbie Straube (drums) from Merrilee Rush & the Turnabouts; Toby Bowen (guitar) and Bobby Anderson (drums) from Bighorn; Fred Zeufeldt (drums) from the Viceroys, the Surprise Package, and Bighorn; Buddy Stewart (bass) from Bad Manners; and Dave Belzer from both HUGG and in an early iteration of the future superstar band, Heart. These and additional players all gathered into a shuttered downtown menswear shop (Kalifornia Kreations) that Clark held the lease on. An audio engineer named John A. Peterson set up his gear and they proceeded (late at night after general traffic noise outside died down) to cut a batch of Caldirola's songs – tunes selected to demonstrate the breadth of Caldirola's compositional skills. As he once told Eothen “Egon” Alapatt of the Now-Again record company: “We were trying to get a record deal so we cut all of these tapes, of various songs, in various styles, to show how versatile I could be.” Alapatt, Eothen. Liner notes, Enjoy The Experience – Homemade Records 1958-1992 (2013) (Sinecure Books / Now-Again Records NA-5100-CD) thumb Dennis the Fox, August, 1972 Then in September 1972, Caldirola and Clark headed south to Hollywood and began hustling the tapes around to various record companies. “To our dismay,” the songwriter once recalled, “the record labels found the material ‘too versatile’ for their marketing purposes.” Caldirola, Dennis. Liner notes, Mothertrucker (2017) (Modern Harmonic MH-8025 (stereo LP)) Three months passed by, the guys ran out of money, and they necessarily returned home to Seattle. That’s when they decided to release it independently on John A. Peterson’s MusArt label – which had previously been used for releasing religious choir LPs, but now would be useful for issuing Caldirola’s album, Mothertrucker (MusArt 801). They ordered 1,000 units from a pressing plant, and also arranged to have a similar number of cardboard jackets – which included this bold declaration: “If We Told You The Biggest Rockstar Of The Mid-70’s Would Be This Four-Eyed Italian From Seattle, Washington, You’d Laugh Your Ass Off. Start Laughing.”—printed up. Upon receiving the discs, alas, it was discovered that many were defective and had skips within the first tracks. So, Caldirola and Clark just decided to sit down in his parents’ living room and manually test all 1,000 of them on the family's hi-fi. In the end they discarded about 400 units, and the remaining 600 were then placed into covers that the enterprising duo also had to glue together one-at-a-time by hand. Then they loaded the finished product into the trunk of a car and took the LPs around to several local record shops that accepted small quantities on a consignment basis. Mothertrucker boasted eye-grabbing post-Psychedelic Era artwork created by Seattle's Robert Barbarus and a dozen songs featuring lyrical themes that precluded any hope of being embraced by mainstream radio. Among the following dozen songs, Caldirola takes listeners on a mind-boggling tour of a landscape that includes vivid plotlines, sketchy characters including a mean man-eating truck-driving woman and plenty of pearls of worldly wisdom like: “When it comes to really livin’, you're just somewhere in between, there's a high-steppin’ side-steppin’ life outside, you ain’t never seen.” The songs that comprise Mothertrucker offer daring listeners an instructive glimpse into that very world. 1973-85: The Music Biz Caldirola managed to sell the bulk of his Mothertrucker LP stock, without achieving his dream of becoming a global rock star. But he did create a music career that lasted well into his thirties. A list of notable highlights from this period would include his time in 1976 playing keyboards with a revived first generation local band, Tiny Tony & the Statics. Then, between 1979 and 1981, Caldirola hooked up with Thom Bell – the esteemed Philadelphia-based producer who a long track record of scoring hits for the likes of the Delfonics, Dionne Warwick, and the Stylistics. Bell had recently relocated to Seattle where he began working out of the town’s best studio, Kaye Smith, cutting tracks there with artists including Elton John and the Spinners. Caldirola worked as a Professional Manager with Mighty Three Music – the publishing arm of Philadelphia International Records and Thom Bell Productions – where he assessed new songs, coached songwriters, and steered worthy songs to many nationally recognized artists. Along the way, a few of Caldirola’s originals also got placed with up-and-coming singers. In 1980 Dee Dee Bridgewater released her version of “When Love Comes Knockin’”, which Caldirola co-wrote with Joe Erickson from the funk band Push – as producer, Bell took a writer's credit). Then in 1981 Phyllis Hyman recorded their “Just Another Face In The Crowd.” That same year, Jr. Cadillac – the Northwest's premiere roots rock band (as founded in 1970 by members of several first generation rock bands including: the Wailers, Frantics, Sonics, Redcoats, and Mark V) – released a recording of “(The Original) Comeback Girl” co-written by Caldirola with the band's leader, Ned Neltner. In 1981 Caldirola also moved back to Italy where he assembled a rockabilly band, Dennis & the Jets, who became very popular up through 1984 when he returned to Seattle. Caldirola carried on in various entertainment industry roles including: working as: a booking agent with Far West Entertainment; an Assistant Cruise Director onboard ships for the Princess Cruise line (1981-1983); Deputy Cruise Director for Sundance Cruises (1985-1986). Ever the showman, Caldirola eventually also launched a new career as a popular auctioneer-for-hire, and simultaneously took on the ongoing role as Executive Director of Seattle's annual Festa Italiana, the Italian festival at Seattle Center. 2004--17: Mothertrucker (A Slight Return) Life went on, Caldirola became a father, and the years passed by. Mothertrucker seemed to be a nearly forgotten relic from the distant past. But then suddenly in 2004 someone sent Caldirola a copy of WaxPoetics magazine (issue No. 8) which featured an essay by funk music expert Dante Carfagna titled “Left-Field Americana: Private Press LPs” that included coverage of Mothertrucker. Dante Carfagna began by riffing humorously on the tragic topic of Elvis impersonators and how so many guys are seemingly born with that “crippling affliction.” Then, before doling out crumbs of praise, Carfagna proceeds to insulting Caldirola's full mature voice – not to mention his Disco Era tonsorial and sartorial splendor – “a twenty-something Seattle native and judging by the picture on the back of the LP, surely the ‘Fox’ part of his name doesn’t come from his average looks. His appearance does betray his voice though, as you’d tend to think he was on some Hot Tub ballads or Marina Rock epics judging from the snapshot. Instead the Fox sounds like a much older man who was...really affected by...Presley. ... But enough about his voice, for it's the music that would draw one to this obscure mid-‘70s release. … the album must have gotten Dennis laid on at least a few occasions, because if it didn’t all might have been for naught.” Our critic then concluded with understandably inaccurate conjecture about the entire album, imagining that it is “as if most of the music came from different sources and they need to tie it all down with a single vocalist.” Carfagna, Dante. “Left-Field Americana: Private Press LPs,\\" WaxPoetics magazine (issue No. 8) Spring 2004 [Brooklyn, NY] Nope. Every single song on Mothertrucker was produced from the creative mind of Dennis Caldirola. A bit “too versatile” perhaps? Not to the true fans of Caldirola's nearly-operatic baritone crooning and heartfelt storytelling- in-song. As Caldirola would later tell Northwest music historian, Peter Blecha, “This was the first inkling I had that there were serious antique vinyl collectors out there searching for the damn thing.” Caldirola, Dennis. email to Peter Blecha, February 5, 2017 Indeed they were. On the rare occasion that the now 32-year old album surfaced in the marketplace it was selling at auction for over $500. One song from it, “Piledriver,” had developed such a fan-base that it was even bootlegged in Europe as a single on the Scorpio Sounds label (No. SS001). By 2007 Caldirola could not resist having his master tapes digitized and he rereleased Mothertrucker in compact disc form (MusArt MA 801). Along the way over-the-top hyper-hyperbolic reviews of the album began surfacing in publications including The Stranger magazine.Segal, Dave. \\"Dennis The Fox's 'Piledriver,'\\" May 19, 2010, The Stranger magazine website accessed on May 6, 2017 (http://www.thestranger.com/lineout/archives/2010/05/19/dennis-the-foxs-pile- driver) Patrick “The Lama” Lundborg, author of the Acid Archives book from 2006 described Mothertrucker as being a “Priceless loungerock extravaganza like if Jade Stone & Luv had John Ylvisaker on vocals.” Lundborg, Patrick “The Lama.” Acid Archives website accessed on March 23, 2017 In 2013 noted collector and operator of the Now-Again label, Eothen “Egon” Alapatt, commented in an interview about Caldirola: “This guy really had it all and is one of the nicest, most normal guys you’ll ever meet. He just happened to make an album that sounds as if some seedy weirdo Northwestern biker dreg made it on his way to the pen.” Alapatt, Eothen “Egon.” Interviewed by Eilon Paz, dustandgrooves.com website accessed on April 13, 2017 (http://dustandgrooves.com/eothen-egon-alapatt-los-angeles-ca/) Taking it at least a step or two further, Paul Major, simply raved: “Utterly dark and sleazy lowlife nirvana! Like seeing God in a burst condom stuck to the tailpipe of a rusty pimpmobile, finding out Jesus stole your mama, looking for the meaning of life in a puke pile by a truckstop motel … kinda scary how real this dude is! ‘One of the guys’ deep level real people music that sounds like no other LP in the universe. Everything about this sound could not possibly add up in anybody else's mind, but Dennis has put a new place on the map. Seedy singles bar action blends with loner westcoast beatpoet bones. One of those smart literate guys attracted to funky situations. Totally fucked up sense of humour...If psychedelia smelled like the little bed-chamber in a long-haul semi-trailer truck loaded with a shipment of Trojans for the sleaziest whorehouse in town ... you'd get some of the music, but it's probably just another layer of illusion Dennis is screwing about with, tons of hot guitar, organ, sax, sex, trashy femme vocal accents, astonishing delivery of lyrics from a zone twilight never leaves. The music ranges from seedy bluesy loser zones into fucker up dive bar epiphanies. I can't think of any other record more at the end of the road seeking salvation in the tawdry. Wicked sense of humour. ... If any LP in my own stash turns the end-of-the- night losers into big heroes ... this one does. ... I still figure I'll wake up tomorrow and find out it was one of my own deluded dreams, nobody could nail the vibe in the waking world.” Major (Editor), Paul. Enjoy The Experience – Homemade Records 1958-1992 (New York/ Los Angeles: Sinecure Books, 2013) 176-177 Compilations and samples The dawning of the new millennium brought with it the first in an ongoing string of sightings of various songs from Mothertrucker being included on compilation albums. In 2001 “Piledriver” appeared on Yee-Haw! The Other Side of Country (Q.D. K. Media CD 039). In 2008 “Flight of the Phoenix” appeared on Keep On Struttin…’ – A Tribute To The Meters (Le Smoke Disque B001KYQSBA). In 2012 “Piledriver” appeared on Country Funk: 1969-1975 (Light In The Attic Records LITA 083) as it did in 2013 on Enjoy The Experience – Homemade Records 1958-1992 (Sinecure Books / Now-Again Records NA-5100-CD). It was in late summer of 2005 that the first tune utilizing a sample from Mothertrucker was spotted. That was when the California-based record producer D.J. Shadow’s Funky Skunk disc (DJ Shadow/Obey Reconstruction B000BRONYQ) was released with a sample from “Piledriver.” Then in 2010 The Alchemist + Oh No’s Gangrene album (Decon Records DCN 101) was issued replete with a sample from “Bazooka” on the tune, “Take Drugs.” What comes next for Mothertrucker is anyone’s guess, but it’s certainly been a wild ride for Dennis The Fox who is probably laughing his ass off at this very moment.

Additionally, various groups have acted to preserve his legacy. Theodore Roosevelt Association In 1919, the Theodore Roosevelt Association (originally known as the Permanent Memorial National Committee) was founded by friends and supporters of Roosevelt. Soon renamed the Roosevelt Memorial Association (RMA), it was chartered in 1920 under Title 36 of the United States Code. In parallel with the RMA was an organization for women, The Women's Theodore Roosevelt Association, that had been founded in 1919 by an act of the New York State Assembly. Both organizations merged in 1956 under the current name. This organization preserved Roosevelt's papers in a 20-year project, preserved his photos and established four public sites: the reconstructed Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site, New York City, dedicated in 1923 and donated to the National Park Service in 1963; Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Park, Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, dedicated in 1928 and given to the people of Oyster Bay; Theodore Roosevelt Island in the Potomac River in Washington, D.C., given to the federal government in 1932; Sagamore Hill, Roosevelt's Oyster Bay home, opened to the public in 1953 and was donated to the National Park Service in 1963 and is now the Sagamore Hill National Historic Site.

It is a racial and ethnic identity model created specifically for people who identify as white. This theory, heavily influenced by William Cross, has become a widely referenced and studied theory on white racial identity development.Patton, L. D., Renn, K. A., Guido, F. M., Quaye, S. J., Evans, N. J., & Forney, D. S. (2016). Student development in college: Theory, research, and practice. John Wiley & Sons. This model was created “to raise the awareness of white people about their role in creating and maintaining a racist society, and the need for them to act responsibly by dismantling systemic racism through a framework of power and privilege,”.Helms, J. E. (1995). An update of Helms's white and people of color racial identity models. In J.G. Ponterotto, J.M. Casas, L.A. Suzuki, & C.M. Alexander (Eds.), Handbook of multicultural counseling (pp. 181-198). Thousand Oaks, CA: Sage. In addition, Helms presented the idea that all people have a racial identity in some way that is influenced by power and privilege.  Two sequential phases  The White Racial Identity Model is broken into five stages, split into two groups: Abandonment of Racism and the Evolution of a non-racist identity. White individuals transition from understanding themselves as racial beings and the privilege associated with being white, to taking ownership of and abandoning racial privilege, and finally learning about other racial groups. In phase one, the abandonment of racism, white-identifying individuals have no consciousness of their race and privilege until they are met with a disruption related to race. This disruption then challenges the individual’s ideas of whiteness and how they play a role in a racist society. Following this encounter, the individual then begins to understand the salience of race and its relevance to power. In this stage, a person moves through three other sub- stages: Contact, Disintegration, and Reintegration. Once an individual has experienced phase one, they move to phase two, the evolution of a non-racist identity, where they begin to reflect more seriously on their identity and how they interact with their surroundings. They begin to make more efforts to interact and learn from different racial groups. Helms wrote that people in this phase are working to “be White without also being bad, evil, or racist”. The stages a person moves through in this phase includes Pseudo-independence, Immersion/Emersion, and Autonomy.Helms, J.E. (1992). A race is a nice thing to have: A guide to being a white person or understanding the white persons in your life. Topeka, KS: Content Communications.  Research and measurement  The White Racial Identity Model has been measured using the White Racial Identity Attitudes Scale (WRIAS) developed originally in 1990 by Helms and Carter.Leach, M. M., Behrens, J. T., & LaFleur, N. K. (2002). White Racial Identity and White Racial Consciousness: Similarities, Differences, and Recommendations. Journal Of Multicultural Counseling & Development, 30(2), 66. Helms has said that this scale can be used to quantify the “multidimensional aspect” of the identity statues. Although this scale has been critiqued, it has been replicated in several studies and the scales in this measure are highly correlated in measuring this construct. Helms and Cook, however, recommend using qualitative analysis in conjunction with the WRIAS to develop a racial profile for these individuals.Helms, J.E. & Cook, D.A. (1999). Using race and culture in counseling and psychotherapy: Theory and process. Boston: Allyn & Bacon.  Critiques  One of the main critiques of this model is that it is outdated and not as applicable as it once was. The theory was created in 1990 and revised in 1995. Although it has been updated, there are many other white identity development and consciousness models that have been adapted from this that some researchers and practitioners see as more relevant. Row, Bennett, and Atkinson created their own theory in response to concerns they had with Helm’s model. These critiques included the singular focus on blacks and the white-black relationship, the developmental stage focus of the model, and the similarities to ethnic identity models. They created the White Racial Consciousness Theory to address these concerns.

Location  The ruins lie in the Zarten Basin at the entrance to the Höllental valley, the Wagensteig valley and the Unteribental valley. The castle occupied a strategic site and guarded the road through the valley of the Wagensteigbach up to Thurner. The village of Wiesneck grew up around the castle early. The village was incorporated into the municipality of Buchenbach in 1837.  History  The castle was first mentioned in 1079 and was in the possession of the counts of Haigerloch. In 1096, someone was named after the castle for the first time when Count Adalberg of Haigerloch called himself von Haigerloch-Wiesneck. The castle was built on the edge of the territory of the ruling Zähringen family, so the lords of the castle established themselves immediately next to their rivals.Peter Rombach: Unbekanntes Dreisamtal. Selbstverlag, Stegen, In 1118, Bruno of Haigerloch-Wiesneck founded St. Märgen's Abbey. Around 1121, the castle was first destroyed, by Zähringens, but was soon rebuilt by them. The family of the Counts of Haigerloch-Wiesneck died out in 1170, whereupon castle and estate went to the counts of Hohenberg. They sold it in 1293. During the Peasants' War, the castle was overrun by a Haufen of rebellious peasants under Hans von Bulgenbach and destroyed, but partially rebuilt soon afterwards. In 1577, it went to the Freiherren of Sickingen-Hoheburg. During the Thirty Years' War, the castle was destroyed in 1646 by the French invaders. Thereafter, the castle was used as a quarry for the surrounding area.  Site  Vegetation growing on the ruins of Wiesneck Of the old castle, only the entrance area and a few wall-remains survive. Nevertheless, the outer ward, inner ward and palas can still be clearly made out from the remains that prove it was one of the larger castles in the region at the time.

His main title was that of an overseer of the treasuries.Wolfgang Helck: Zur Verwaltung des Mittleren und Neuen Reichs, 1958, p. 408, 516. Tia was married to a woman with the same name, the princess Tia who was sister of Ramses II. Career and Family Not much is known about the early years. One of the earliest mentions of Tia is on a block now in the University of Chicago Oriental Institute (no. 10507). Tia and a man named Amenwashu are shown before King Seti I and the then crown-prince Ramesses II. Habachi conjectured that Amenwashu was Tia's father, but there is no evidence to support this idea. The identification of the man Tia on the Chicago stela with the official Tia is based on the rarity of the name. It is not known when Tia married Ramesses's sister Tia. Tia had several honorific titles including hereditary prince and governor, seal-bearer of the King, sole companion, overseer of the secrets of the royal palace, favorite of the Horus in his palace, eyes of the King, and ears of the King. Tia's executive titles include, King's scribe, fanbearer on the right of the King and his most common title: overseer of the treasury in the Temple of Usermaatre Setepenre in the Domain of Amun. A limestone block shows Tia and Tia in the presence of Queen Tuya. This scene likely comes from the tomb in Saqqara is now in the Royal Ontario Museum (no 955-79-2).

The tomb is not very well preserved. The main entrance was on the east side. There was a first courtyard and a second one that was adorned with columns. At the back there were chapels and at the very back a small pyramid.T. G. Martin: The Hidden Tombs of Memphis, London 1991, , p. 102 The outer courtyard of the tomb contained two smaller tomb-chapels. One of the chapels belonged to Iurudef, while the name of the owner of the second chapel is not known. A stela of an official belonging to the household of Tia, named Panakhtenniut, was found nearby. There is, however, no evidence that he was the owner of the chapel. Tia was already known from several objects before his tomb was discovered. A pyramidion reached England in 1722 and was brought there from Alexandria. It is only known from old drawings, but they are good enough to read the name and titles.Jaromir Malek: Two Monuments of the Tias, in: Journal of Egyptian Archaeology 60 (1974), pp. 165-167, pl.

The site of coal mines in the 19th century, after the turn of the century it became known as the Cragmor area for the Cragmor Sanitorium. By the 1950s, the mines were abandoned and the land was developed for housing. Cragmor was annexed to the City of Colorado Springs in the early 1960s. The Cragmor Sanatorium became the main hall for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs campus. History and geography =Mining= Before the area was named Cragmore, beginning about 1859, the area was mined for coal. There were 50 coal mines in Colorado Springs. The Cragmor mines were the City Mine, the Altitude, Williamsville Mine, Curtis Mine, Patterson Mine, the Climax mines, the Conley, Busy Bee, and the Danville. Coal was mined using the \\"room and pillar\\" method, in which areas of unmined coal acted as pillars while coal was removed from the shafts, creating rooms. Sometimes, rather than leaving the pillar for support, the supporting coal was removed. Coal was mined from fields from one to fourteen feet deep. Of the city's 50 abandoned mines, 22 have become hazardous because they were \\"very shallow mines\\"—some no more than below the surface—that are now subject to sinking under developed land. For instance, the ground gives way after wood that held up the roof of the rooms deteriorates, generally 10 to 20 years after the mines closed. There are also hazards due to mine openings, drainage of metals or other pollutants from the mines, or fires within mines or the outside waste banks. Many of the hazardous, abandoned mines are near Cragmor, such as Cragmor Country Club Estates that had about 3,000 residents in the late 1980s. There were more than 2,400 crack and sinkholes in the Cragmor Country Club Estates area, while there were only a total of seven in other areas of Colorado Springs during a 1985 study supervised by the Colorado Mined Land Reclamation Division. = Cragmor Sanatorium= The area was named by Dr. Edwin Solly, who began plans to build the 100 acre Cragmor Sanatorium in 1902, when William Jackson Palmer donated funds to build a sanatorium. The Cragmor Sanatorium opened in 1905. Located between the bluffs of Palmer Park and Austin Bluffs, he named it for the moors and craigs of Great Britain, which described \\"where high bluffs join the low plains\\". Cragmor is located about in elevation above and northeast of downtown Colorado Springs. Located on a bluff of prairie grass, pines, and ground oaks, the sanatorium's westward view included Pikes Peak and Rampart Range. In the following decades it developed a following among the cultural elite and many of its patients were wealthy. However, they were hit hard by the Great Depression in the 1930s and Cragmor suffered from financial distress into the 1940s. It was briefly reinvigorated in the 1950s when a contract with the Bureau of Indian Affairs established Cragmor as a treatment center for Navajo people with tuberculosis. About ten years later, the Navajo patients were transferred elsewhere. = Residential development = Bungalows were built for patients and physicians of the Cragmor Sanatorium in an area named Cragmor Village. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places by 2013 for its historical significance during the sanatoria era and because it is threatened by plans for expansion of the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS) campus. By the 1950s, coal was no longer mined in the area and land was developed for the construction of about 3,500 houses, which was completed in the early 1960s. Then, the initial instances of subsidence began, such as one on Mount View Lane in 1963. In another case, a dog died when the earth sunk in the backyard beneath a dog who became trapped in the falling dirt and died due to suffocation. In 1979, earth fell through an old mine shaft by a fourplex on Magnolia Street in the Cragmor area, forcing the evacuation of the residents and requiring a means to brace the building. =Annexation= The City of Colorado Springs began to annex sections of the area in 1953, when Cragmor Heights and Cragmor Hills were incorporated into Colorado Springs. Four thousand acres were annexed to Colorado Springs on December 23, 1969. The following year, Cragmor area residents took the city to court for several reasons, including preferring the services offered by the North Suburban district over that of the City of Colorado Springs. Following a Colorado Supreme Court decision in 1972, the annexation was upheld, supporting the 1970 decision of the El Paso District Court. In 2015, Lookout at Cragmor was also annexed. =University of Colorado Colorado Springs= As early as the 1945, University of Colorado offered classes in the Colorado Springs area at various locations, mostly Colorado College. By the 1960s, however, a permanent campus was desired. Dr. George Dwire, the Executive Director of the Cragmor Sanatorium, sold the sanatorium property for $1 to the state, which became the property of the University of Colorado in 1964. In 1965, UCCS moved to its current location on Austin Bluffs Parkway in the Cragmor neighborhood of northern Colorado Springs. The campus is located at one of the highest parts of the city. Because of its ties to Hewlett-Packard, initial university programs focused on engineering and business, and classes were held in the Cragmor Sanatorium building, what is now Main Hall, and Cragmor Hall, a modern expansion of Main Hall. The first building built exclusively for the University of Colorado Colorado Springs (UCCS), Dwire Hall, was completed in 1972. A 1997 community referendum merged Beth-El College of Nursing with UCCS. In recent years, programs such as the Network Information and Space Security Center were added to connect the university with the military to improve national security. Other programs, including the CU Institute for Bioenergetics and the Institute for Science and Space Studies, cast an eye toward the future. In 2001, UCCS purchased an building at the corner of Union and Austin Bluffs to house the Beth-El College of Nursing. The former Katherine Bates Elementary School at 702 Cragmor Road was razed to create dormitory housing for the campus, which is scheduled to be completed by fall 2017. There are also plans for the five-story housing project, The Lookout on Cragmor at 10 Cragmor Village Road. Neighborhoods In what is now Central Colorado Springs, the Cragmor neighborhood is located by the UCCS campus. Cragmor is divided in two areas by Austin Bluffs. The South Cragmor neighborhood is located south of the UCCS campus, between Austin Bluffs Parkway and Templeton Gap. The North Cragmor neighborhood is located north of Cragmor Village Road, and between the UCCS campus and Union Boulevard. Parks and sports complex Within the South Cragmor neighborhood are Danville Park, Portal Park, and Grace Center for Athletics. Danville Park is a 5.3 acre park located at 1147 Mountview Lane at North Hancock Avenue. It has fields for baseball and soccer, a basketball court, a playground, and picnic area. Portal Park, a 10.6 acre park, is located at 3535 North Hancock Avenue, is a 10.6 acre park with an outdoor swimming pool, baseball and soccer fields, multi- play court, tennis courts, and trails. The swimming pool was built in 1974 and 1975. In 1979, subsidence resulted in a sinkhole in the park. It was discovered that below the surface of the park were mine shafts and the pool was slipping into a shafts. The sinkhole was filled and the pool was braced when tons of concrete were poured into the shafts. Grace Center for Athletics is a 25 acre sports complex of St. Mary's High School for baseball, soccer, football, track and field, field hockey, lacrosse. It is used by the school and by non-profit organizations for children of Southern Colorado.

A Nemirovich-Danchenko student at the Philharmonic Institute, Roksanova started out at the Vilno-based Konstantin Nezlobin's enterprise, then performed in Odessa for a while for the Solovtsov group.POKCAHOBA, Мария Людомировна at the Soviet Literary Encyclopedia She then joined MAT in 1898, invited by Stanislavski who'd seen saw her performance in August 1897 in one of the Moscow region theatres. During the first season she played Princess Mstislavskaya in Tsar Fyodor Ioannovich and Ismene in Antigona so great hopes were pinned on her as Nina Zarechnaya in The Seagull which seemed to be a part she was born for. But not long before that Nemirovich-Danchenko's production of Greta's Happiness, with her in the lead, dismally flopped. Roksanova, thrown off her balance, gave a flawed performance as Nina. Adding to her trouble was the fact that, according to Nemirovich- Danchenko, she had been disoriented by Stanislavsky's views of the interpretation of the part which contradicted his own one.Worrall, Nick. 1996. The Moscow Art Theatre. Theatre Production Studies ser. London and NY: Routledge. . Pp. 98-101 Chekhov, with uncharacteristic harshness, demanded that some other actress should substitute Roksanova in his play. The role remained hers, but the damage done to her stage integrity proved to be irrevocable, according to theatre historian Inna Solovyova.Maria Roksanova's biography at the Moscow Art Theatre site Roksanova played Hanne in Drayman Henschel, Kupava in The Snow Maiden and Tatyana in Maxim Gorky's The Philistines to some acclaim, but decided to leave the theatre in 1902, to join Vsevolod Meyerkhold's New Drama. Later she moved to Saint Petersburg's New Theatre, then, with her husband, the actor N.N. Mikhaylovsky, to Riga. In 1923 Roksanova returned to MAT and up until 1927 worked for the theatre's Fourth Studio. Later in the decade, she emigrated, but before the War returned to USSR and joined the Chamber Theatre (Камерный театр). She died in 1958 in the Old Actor's House in Moscow.

She was a prominent member of Den Kvinnelige Tjenerstands Forening (The Women's Servant Class Association) from 1910 and its chair from 1915. After the association joined the Labour Party, she became a leading member of the Norwegian Labour Party's Women's Federation from 1918, remaining in key positions until 1953. Biography Born on 17 January 1885 in Hokksund, Øvre Eiker, she was the daughter of Thorleif Olsen (born 1846) and his partner Ingeborg (born 1851). When she was 17, she became a maid in the home of the poet Per Sivle who awakened her interest in politics. She later moved to Christiania where she was a housemaid for the politician Kyrre Grepp. In 1907, in connection with a dispute in the paper industry, she took part in a demonstration in St. Hanshaugen where she experienced the workers strong spirit of cohesion. \\"From that day on, I was ready to join the labour movement,\\" she later explained. She became a member of the Women's Servant Class Association in 1910, serving as its chairman in 1915. When the organization joined the Labour Party, she joined the executive committee of the party's Women's Federation. In 1918, when Hanna Adolfsen retired as a result of failing health, Thorleifsen became the federation's leader. The same year, she was elected as a deputy member of the Labour Party's central committee, serving as a full member from 1919 to 1923. In 1923, Thorleifer, together with Sigrid Syvertsen, established the Labour Party's Women's Secretariat (Arbeiderpartiets Kvinnesekretariat) directly answerable to the party's leadership. Under the chairmanship of Syvertsen, she filled the post of permanent secretary until 1953, always serving the interests of the party. Her success in politics was mainly a result of her organizational abilities and her public speaking. While others used the Women's Federation as a springboard, she continued to support the movement loyally until she was forced into retirement for health reasons. Thorleifsen also served as a member of Oslo's city council from 1932 to 1934. Together with Sigrid Syvertsen, Thorleifer wrote Kvinner i strid: historien om Arbeiderpartiets kvinnebevegelse (1960), the only comprehensive historical account of the Labour Party's Women's Federation.

It is one of two railway lines built by both state governments following an agreement in 1912 to connect to each other's railway networks. There has been calls for standardisation over the past two decades from Heywood to Wolseley since the Melbourne to Adelaide line was converted in 1995. Naming The line is gazetted as the “Mount Gambier-Heywood Railway” by both the South Australian and Victorian governments. This name was also used in a report jointly published by the two state governments in 2009. Newspaper reports published in both states about the railway line prior to its opening used the title “Portland-Mount Gambier Railway.” Some sources published in Victoria refer to the line as the “Mount Gambier line.” History The South Australian and Victorian governments agreed on 28 November 1912 to connect their respective railway networks at two places by constructing lines between Heywood and Mount Gambier and between Murrayville in Victoria and Pinnaroo in South Australia with legislation subsequently passed by both parliaments being enacted on 14 December 1912 and 23 December 1912 respectively. The agreement between the two state governments gave the responsibility for the construction of the line between Heywood and Mount Gambier to the Government of Victoria and the responsibility for the line between Murrayville and Pinnaroo to the Government of South Australia. The section of line between Heywood and Dartmoor was completed on 22 June 1916 with the remainder of the line being complete on 28 November 1917. The railway line opened for business on 28 November 1917 without any “special ceremony” and with passenger services scheduled for Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The rail service between Mount Gambier and Heywood was suspended on 11 April 1995 due to the standardization of the gauges of the Melbourne–Adelaide and the Maroona-Portland lines. The South Australian section of the line between Mount Gambier and Rennick was used by the tourist service, the Limestone Coast Railway, until 20 March 1999. In 2009, the South Australian and Victorian governments published an action plan for freight services within the Green Triangle Region which advised that projected volumes of woodchip intended for export from the Port of Portland in the years 2012-2015 would make a restored Mount Gambier–Heywood rail line a “potentially … commercially viable” operation. Due to the construction of a public space park where Mount Gambier railway station once stood in 2015, the line is no longer connected to the Millicent and Wolseley lines.

Early life In 1987 at the age of 10, Tom decided he wanted to act after seeing Michael J. Fox in Back to the Future. Tom's mother, Ann, suggested the Winchester Cooperative Theatre. Tom memorized the Gettysburg Address in order to audition for Willy Wonka and got a small role. The following year, he was chosen to play the lead role of Pinocchio. Tom worked with the Magic Circle Theatre with Brian Milauskas, also from Winchester. In 1990, Milauskas sent a letter to a number of pupils he thought should try out for a miniseries about the Kennedy family titled \\"The Kennedys of Massachusetts\\". Despite his mother throwing away the letter and telling him it would be a waste of time, he persisted. His mother relented and took the day off work and took Tom to the casting agency. Although unprepared, with only a wallet-sized photo in place of a portfolio with headshots, Tom auditioned for a number of roles including a young John F. Kennedy Jr. Eventually Tom was offered the role of a 9 to 12 year old John F. Kennedy Jr. which he accepted, going on to do the series. Career Tom developed an interest in writing following his graduation from Winchester High School in 1995. He then went on to study at Emerson College, where he received a film degree in 1999. Following his graduation he moved to Los Angeles, California to take up an internship where he worked on \\"Talk Soup\\" and \\"The Anna Nicole Show\\" before moving on to more actively pursue writing.

The documentary explores the history of the mile and a half long stretch of road through West Hollywood known as Sunset Strip. It premiered at the South by Southwest Film Festival. Synopsis The film begins with a poem recited by Mark Mahoney, and utilizes several celebrities to discuss the history of the Sunset Strip. The Sunset Strip was born during the Roaring 20's as a dirt road connecting Hollywood's big studios to the new development known as Beverly Hills. The so-called strip was just outside of the LAPDs jurisdiction, which provided the ideal environment for speakeasies, brothels, and crime of every level, but also led to much creativity. Using the stars who worked and found success there, this film explores the stories that make up the history of the Sunset Strip. Much of the time spent is on the 50-70s era, but the film touches upon major events such as the Golden Age of Hollywood at Ciros and the Trocadero, The Doors playing at the Whiskey-A-Go-Go and The Roxy, legends about Mickey Cohen, and the multiple influential rock artists who called that part of the city home.  Production  Tommy Alastra Productions began shooting in 2010. The film features so-called \\"guerilla footage\\" (amateur shots, often from the crowd's perspective) of the Strip's club and rock and roll shows, and interviews shot in different locations. Conversation-style interviews about memories are used, as opposed to the traditional \\"talking at the camera\\" format of documentaries. As a result, the film eschews the more structured format of shaping its ideas. Many of the interviews feature more than one actor or musician, and Tommy Alastra Productions compiled footage under multiple sources. It was a challenge to remove background noise, create smooth sound quality and ensure archival footage was presented clearly as a result.  Celebrity appearances  Various musicians, movie celebrities, and personalities are asked about their experiences in and around the Sunset Strip, and their recollection of important moments (such as the shutdown of Tower Records).  Music  The documentary lists a total of 48 songs in the credits, ranging from “You Set the Scene” by Love to “The Trip” by Donovan as well as music from Ratt, X, The Pussycat Dolls and Jane's Addiction. Slash, Billy Corgan, Robbie Krieger of The Doors and Perry Farrell are all featured speakers in the documentary.  Release and distribution  Sunset Strip debuted at the South by Southwest (SXSW) film festival in Austin Texas, The Cannes Film Festival in France and several others before being acquired by Showtime Networks and Netflix through Ben Silverman's Electus Distribution. A special Collector's Edition DVD was also released, and contained bonus interviews from several celebrities, including Hugh Hefner, Dave Navarro, Ozzy Osbourne, Keanu Reeves, Alice Cooper and more.

The SR is responsible for investigating legal cases where suspicions of tax fraud, tax evasion, or other violations of tax law are found within Iceland. The SR is accountable to the Icelandic Minister of Finance, Benedikt Jóhannesson.Skattrannsóknarstjóri ríkisins, November 4, 1996 History and organization The SR was founded in 1993 with the goal of functioning as a specialized and autonomous intelligence agency focused specifically on the tax system. The director of the SR is appointed by, and responsible only to, the Minister of Finance. While the central SR office is located in Reykjavík, the office still investigates all alleged tax crimes in all of Iceland’s nine tax districts of Reykjavík, Akranes, Ísafjörður, Siglufjörður, Akureyri, Egilsstaðir, Hella, Vestmannaeyjar and Hafnarfjörður.The Directorate of Tax Investigations in Iceland The SR operates under Icelandic regulation and law nos. 361/1995, 50/1988, 45/1987, 113/1990, 145/1994, 144/1990, and 37/1993. =Budget= The SR has 24 employees, most of whom have university degrees in business, economics, or law. In 2006 the SR’s allotted budget was ISK 155m or ~$2.2m USD. The SR submits an annual budget to the Ministry of Finance by February 15 each year. The report includes a report on the SR’ operations and activities as well as a balance sheet for the previous year. Purpose The main role of the SR is to investigate and inform on the infringement of Icelandic tax laws, and reduce tax evasion. The SR is tasked with three central objectives by the Ministry of Finance. # Investigate all cases where there is a suspected presence of tax fraud. # To represent the state of Iceland in legal cases in which a penalty procedure is conducted through a closed administrative action by the State Internal Revenue Board. # The preparation of major cases for criminal proceedings, and for further investigation by both the National Commissioner of the Icelandic Police and the Directorate of Public Prosecutions. There are two objectives of SR investigations:The Directorate of Tax Investigations in Iceland # Conclusions of SR investigations must be a basis for tax assessment. # Conclusions of SR investigations must serve as a basis for possible criminal proceedings. The SR is tasked with investigating violations of all Icelandic tax laws levied or enforced by the Directorate of Internal Revenue, and violations of the Accounting Act and Financial Statements Act. Any other activities fall outside the SR’ scope of authority. Once a tax investigation case has concluded, the SR decides whether or not criminal proceedings are initiated. If criminal proceedings are initiated, they may proceed in three manners. The taxpayer is fined an amount deemed necessary by the SR, the SR presents a payment claim before the State Internal Revenue Board, or the case is referred to the Icelandic Police. Each year, the SR investigates ~100 tax fraud cases. Tax fraud in Iceland tends to be concentrated in the restaurant and food industries. Relationship with district tax offices When a district tax office finds an Icelandic taxpayer in breach of tax law after conducting their general tax control, the SR receives the case from the district tax office. Any case where there is a suspicion of possible tax fraud, it is required by law to be reported to the SR. The SR can also receive cases from state tax collectors, and the police if technical expertise is needed in accounting or fraud cases. Successes Since its inception, the SR has implemented major changes in how the Icelandic government combats tax crimes. Thanks to the SR’s efforts, approximately ISK 4 billion or ~$58 million USD has been collected as a direct result of SR’s proceedings over the “past several years”. =2015 Tax evasion case= In 2015, the SR released a statement that a whistle blower who had offered them data and documents relating to tax evasion by people linked to Iceland requested ISK 150 million (~$1.1 million USD). The information in question was a large leak of sensitive information reportedly showing that The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) had assisted clients worldwide in tax evasion. The SR had initially requested government support to pay for the data, however former Minister of Finance Bjanri Benediktsson later stated that the SR would only pay for the data if the fee was in proportion to the collected tax from the accounts in question. One of the six individuals in the SR’s investigation is an Icelandic passport holder, while the other 5 have other ties to the country.Wants ISK 150 Million for Tax Evader Info References External links Finance Category:Government agencies of Iceland Category:National law enforcement agencies of Iceland Iceland Intelligence agencies ","title":"Skattrannsóknarstjóri Ríkisins"},{"id":"53969547","text":"Justice McWhorter may refer to: *George G.

It was the largest landslide in Colorado's history. Background West Salt Creek is located on the north slope of the Grand Mesa, descending steeply from about elevation at the top of the mountain to about in the Plateau Valley. Via Plateau Creek, it is a tributary of the Colorado River. The valley of West Salt Creek was used mainly for cattle ranching and was mostly private property owned by the Hawkins family. However, the area where the slide originated was located on public land in the Grand Mesa National Forest. The landslide was caused by a mass wasting event in the Green River Formation, which is composed mainly of loose sedimentary rock, namely shale. The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) determined that the event occurred on the site of an ancient landslide dating back to the late Pleistocene or early Holocene, at least 11,700 years ago. Such geological features are not uncommon to this area of the Grand Mesa, which exhibits a \\"landslide bench\\" where creep rates of per year have been previously documented. Initial landslide Unseasonably heavy rains during May 23–24 melted the local snowpack and saturated the ground to the point of instability. A small landslide was recorded at approximately 7:18 AM on May 25, and minor slope movement was noticed throughout the day. At 5:44 PM on May 25 a large chunk of the West Salt Creek valley headwall (known as the \\"slump block\\") collapsed catastrophically. The initial collapse triggered a wave of subsequent rock failures (a \\"rock avalanche\\") that moved down the valley of West Salt Creek, burying almost of land under 38 million yd3 (29 million m3) of debris. The average speed of the landslide was about per hour, with a maximum of per hour, and its maximum depth reached . The slide descended a total of from the rim of the Grand Mesa to the valley below. The speed of the slide was likely increased by a layer of liquefied material underneath the main rock avalanche. Residents described the sound of the landslide as “a low flying, large military helicopter”, \\"a very long clap of thunder\\", or “a freight train coming”. The landslide generated a Mw 2.8 earthquake, destroyed irrigation works and threatened active gas wells in the area, but did not reach Collbran, about further downstream from the toe of the slide. Although the initial slide lasted only about three minutes, a second debris flow occurred on top of the initial slide, followed by a further collapse of the downslope face of the slide. Smaller landslides and slope failures continued for several weeks after the disaster, bringing the total volume of collapsed material to 71.2 million yd3 (54.5 million m3). This makes it much larger than the Oso landslide which occurred two months previously in northern Washington. Vibrations from the slide were recorded by seismographs up to away. Dispatchers in Grand Junction received the first reports of the landslide around 6:15 PM, and the Plateau Valley Fire Department was called into the area. Three people – Wes Hawkins, Clancy Nichols and Danny Nichols – were reported missing after heading into the area to investigate an irrigation ditch, whose flow had been disrupted by the first landslide at 7:18 AM. Local authorities were joined by experts from the USGS and National Weather Service in the search for the missing men; over 40 people were involved in the search. The search was called off the next day due to dangerous and unstable conditions in the area. The bodies were never found and the three men are presumed killed. Aftermath Immediately after the landslide, geologists installed monitoring equipment and conducted an emergency hazard assessment for the area. Because the slide occurred mostly on private property, access for investigation and media coverage was limited; the U.S. Forest Service established a restriction area around the upper part of the slide where it originated in the Grand Mesa National Forest. There was speculation that fracking in the area could have led to the slide due to impact on seismic activity. However, the closest gas well was located lower than where the slide originated, and was drilled into a separate geological formation (the Wasatch Formation), and experts concluded that the slide occurred due to natural causes. Rotation of the slump block dammed the upper part of West Salt Creek, backing up about 120 million gallons (444,000 m3) of water in a temporary lake, threatening downstream communities and landowners. Authorities discussed whether to artificially breach or lower the pond level, but due to the remoteness of the area and its instability, no such work was performed. On May 27, 2016, slightly more than two years after the slide, the pond partially breached, sending a surge of water down West Salt Creek into Plateau Creek; however, the flooding only caused minor damage. The water carved a canyon deep in the upper part of the landslide and established a new channel for West Salt Creek. Although the pond has partially drained, the large tilted slump block with a volume of about 65 million yd3 (50 million m3) remains poised at the top of the escarpment, leaning at about 15 degrees; this combined with pressure from groundwater flow poses \\"a long-term threat for additional slope instability\\". In addition, the USGS continues to monitor impounded water levels at the dammed pond.

Although it is unknown exactly who led the coup attempt against President Sukarno, many relevant individuals and factsRoosa (2006), pp 139-146. support the hypothesis that the PKI, particularly the Special Bureau, played a large role. Many details about PKI involvement in the 30th September Movement and consequent Indonesian Massacre of 1965 still remain unclear.Roosa (2006)  Background  According to testimony by Special Bureau leader Sjam, the Special Bureau began operating officially as an entity in 1964, but secretly operated since the early 1950s under Aidit’s command. It was previously known as the “Military Section of the Organizational Department,” and functioned to recruit military sympathizers to the PKI’s cause. Nearing the time of the coup attempt, the Special Bureau began to have more of an influence within the PKI under the leadership of Sjam.  Role in coup attempt  Although it is not exactly clear how much of a role the Special Bureau played in the actual coup attempt, it is undisputed that the agency had an impact. Evidence as explored by John Roosa suggests that Aidit approved of Sjam’s collaboration with military officers in staging a preemptive strike against the army high command. According to the Supardjo document, a reliable piece of testimonial evidence from the era, Sjam was the primary organizer of the movement. However it is unclear whether Aidit initiated the movement and ordered Sjam to carry it out, or if Aidit allowed Sjam to work with the military officers on the assumption that the officers were leading the movement. In other words, the main question is whether Aidit was the mastermind of the movement, or was merely a misunderstood supporter of the movement. It is difficult to assess Aidit’s involvement due to a lack of reliable and conclusive evidence. Many historians have investigated the coup, yet even in the case of Roosa, no single analysis has provided a conclusive and undisputed storyline. = Key Players = The five main leaders of the Special Bureau were: • Untung • Latief • Soejono • Sjam- Appointed Karto’s replacement after he died, it was rumored that Karto didn’t want Sjam because he was known to be boisterous • Pono- Sjam’s assistant right = Aidit = Dipa Nusantara Aidit was the head of the PKI from the mid-1950s until his death on November 22, 1965. He was executed by the army before given the chance to report his actions. The party died with Aidit, as PKI members had to hide their identity to avoid being rounded up or killed. While he was alive, he was a prolific political leader within the Indonesian political community, especially within the PKI. In the historical study Pretext for Mass Murder, John Roosa explains how he has a reliable source who worked with the PKI and knew of information about the Special Bureau. Roosa’s source, Hasan (pseudonym as Roosa could not disclose his source), confirms that even under Sjam's tenure, Aidit truly directed the Special Bureau.Roosa (2006), pp 144. Sjam, Aidit’s right hand man, was known to be loyal towards Aidit and was personally depended upon for information about military officers and affairs. Aidit and Sjam lived close together in Jakarta and held meetings that looked like regular social visits to avoid suspicion. Since Aidit was a prolific political leader searching for opinions of others, his meetings with Sjam looked typical and aroused minimal suspicion.Roosa (2006), pp 128. Whether or not Aidit initiated the movement, Aidit’s role in the movement, and how much knowledge he had about the movement all remain indeterminate. Hasan claims that Aidit changed the original plan, and instead of the Special Bureau waiting for the coup d'etat, the Special Bureau took action to prevent it.Roosa (2006), pp 145. = Sjam = Kamaruzaman Sjam, born in Tuban in 1924, and was appointed head of the Special Bureau by Aidit in 1963 when formed head Karto died. Though it is known that Sjam took Karto’s place after Karto’s death, it is not certain exactly when Sjam’s leadership in the Special Bureau officially started. While Karto was an experienced, well-known, and well-liked party member who combined above-ground work with secret military networking, Sjam was an anonymous figure in the party who stuck to the shadows. In his courtroom testimony, he claims to have joined the Communist Party in 1949, yet many testimonies of the time were induced by torture so it is unclear whether this is factually true. Shortly after, he was appointed to a position in the PKI. His exact role is unclear, but by his former colleague’s best guess, his responsibility in the PKI was to oversee military affairs. Sjam then joined the Military Section of the PKI under Karto sometime in the 1950s and claims to have worked in the Communist Party’s Organization Department in 1960. Within the Special Bureau, Pono was Sjam’s assistant, Bono the Secretary, Wandi the Treasurer, and Hamim the trainer of the bureau’s cadre. Among these individuals, Sjam was the only one trusted to contact military personnel for the purposes of intelligence gathering by Aidit. “Sjam was unwaveringly loyal to Aidit. He viewed Aidit as the Indonesian version of Stalin or Mao...Sjam felt proud to serve as Aidit’s righthand man.” -Roosa Roosa (2006), pp 136. At the time of the movement Sjam was neither an officially recognized high- ranking military officer nor a prominent civilian politician. No one had even contemplated the idea that this apparent nobody was the leader of an ambitious military operation to seize “all power” until Sjam himself testified to it in 1967. Sjam was ultimately executed in 1968 for his role as a leader in the PKI. Notes References Roosa, John (2006). Pretext for Mass Murder. University of Wisconsin Press.

After finishing fifth in her first start at age two, she won her next three races including the Starlet Stakes. At age three, she finished second in both the Santa Ysabel and Santa Anita Oaks before winning the Grade I Kentucky Oaks, the female equivalent of the Kentucky Derby. She extended her winning streak by taking the Acorn Stakes and Coaching Club American Oaks, before finishing the year with second-place finishes in both the Cotillion Stakes and Breeders' Cup Distaff. She was named the American Champion Three- Year-Old Filly of 2017. At age four, Abel Tasman finished fourth in her first start of the year in the La Troienne Stakes, then rebounded to win the Ogden Phipps and Personal Ensign. She finished her career with 8 wins from 16 starts and winnings of $2,793,385. Background Abel Tasman was bred in Kentucky by Clearsky Farms, established in 2008 by Eamon Cleary and now owned by his sons, Bernard and Eamonn. A relatively small breeding operation with about 30 broodmares, Clearsky Farms was an Eclipse Award finalist for outstanding breeder of 2016 thanks to several noteworthy wins by horses they bred, including champion three-year-old Arrogate's victories in the Travers Stakes and Breeders' Cup Classic. Clearsky Farms purchased Abel Tasman's dam, Vargas Girl, in 2010 for $130,000. Vargas Girl died from complications while foaling Abel Tasman and the filly had to be resuscitated and then raised by a nurse mare. Abel Tasman was sired by Quality Road, whose most important wins included the Florida Derby, Donn Handicap and Woodward Stakes. Quality Road was the leading first crop sire of 2014 and the leading third crop sire of 2016. Abel Tasman was offered at the September 2015 Keeneland Sales but the final bid of $65,000 did not meet her reserve and she was bought back. She originally raced as a homebred for Clearsky Farms and was trained by Simon Callaghan. In January 2017, Clearsky sold a portion of the horse to China Horse Club, which was founded in 2010 by Chinese architect Teo Ah Khing. Following a second-place finishing in the Santa Ysabel Stakes, she was transferred to the barn of Bob Baffert. Abel Tasman was a personal favorite of Baffert because of her gentle nature combined with a good mind. \\"I hope they breed her to American Pharoah,\\" he said, referring to the Triple Crown winner he had also trained, \\"(but the foal) would probably be so nice, it wouldn't want to run.\\" Racing career =2016: two-year-old season= Abel Tasman made her first start on August 20, 2016 at Del Mar Racetrack, finishing fifth. She won her next start on September 30 at Santa Anita Park in a maiden special weight race, then won again in an allowance rate on November 18 at Del Mar. For her final start of the year, Abel Tasman was entered for a supplementary fee of $10,000 in the Grade I Starlet Stakes at Santa Anita over a distance of miles. She went off at odds of 13–1, while the odds-on favorite was the highly regarded American Gal. Abel Tasman got off to a slow start then started her move around the far turn while racing five wide. Nearing the finish line, she caught American Gal to win by a length. \\"I think the distance is the key for this filly\\", said Callaghan. \\"We decided to supplement because she was getting good at the right time and I thought she had the stamina for this race.\\" =2017: three-year-old season= Abel Tasman started her three-year-old campaign on March 4, 2017 in the Santa Ysabel Stakes at Santa Anita. Heavy favorite Unique Bella, considered one of the top fillies in training, went to the early lead and set comfortable fractions. Abel Tasman made a run down the stretch and closed to within a length before Unique Bella responded to her jockey's urging and drew away late to win by lengths. \\"Turning for home, I had a lot of horse under me\\", said jockey Joe Talamo. \\"Hat's off to the winner. What a special filly she is, because... I really had a lot of horse and we had a beautiful trip.\\" Shortly after the race, it was announced that Abel Tasman would be moved from Callaghan's care to the barn of Bob Baffert. During the Santa Ysabel, Talamo had worn the silks of Clearsky Farms although he was supposed to have worn the colors of China Horse Club. According to Callaghan, China Horse Club did not accept his apology for the mix-up. Her next start was the Santa Anita Oaks on April 8. Because of an injury to Unique Bella that kept her out of the race, Abel Tasman became the heavy favorite under new jockey Mike Smith. However, she again finished second after the lightly raced Paradise Woods got off to a large early lead and won by a record lengths. \\"You know, (Paradise Woods) really just blew the field away\\", said Smith. \\"I made sure we got second. There was no catching the winner. And that was good enough for today. We’re going to have to go back to the drawing board, make a couple of changes, tweak this and tweak that a little, and see if we can turn the page in the Kentucky Oaks.\\" One of the changes that Baffert decided to make was adding blinkers. \\"They're little ones and they just keep her focused. She'll be competitive now, but it's a tough deal. There are some really good fillies in there. She needs to get away and not be so far back.\\" Abel Tasman was the fourth betting choice in the Kentucky Oaks, held on May 5 at Churchill Downs over a sloppy (sealed) track. Paradise Woods went to the early lead with Miss Sky Warrior, followed by Farrell in third place. The front runners, who were also the top betting choices, set rapid opening fractions, especially considering the track conditions. All three eventually tired and finished well back. Meanwhile, Abel Tasman broke poorly and was last in the field of fourteen as they headed into the first turn, though she had good position near the rail. In the final turn, Smith moved the filly six wide to get around traffic. She responded with a strong run to win by lengths. \\"For as far back as I was, I knew they were going quick\\", said Smith. \\"Once I got her out in the middle of the track... I knew she was going to run well at that point.\\" After the race, part owner Teo Ah Khing said, \\"We hope that today's race, which is very significant, will put the geographical location and the significance of Kentucky Oaks in the mind of the Chinese, to understand the significance of this race. Asked about the change of trainers in March, the racing manager of China Horse Club stated, \\"We won't comment on it. Simon's a very good trainer and he trained her to a (Grade I) win. Bob's also a champion trainer and he's carried that on. We're thankful for both and everybody can just move on from this moment.\\" Abel Tasman made her next start at Belmont Park on June 10 in the Acorn Stakes, a one-turn mile. The 2-1 favorite, she raced in last place down the backstretch, then started to make up ground on the turn. Smith found an opening on the rail as they rounded into the stretch and Abel Tasman quickly took charge, then held off the challenge of Salty on the outside. On July 23, Abel Tasman was entered in the Coaching Club American Oaks at Saratoga, run at a distance of miles. She broke poorly and settled near the back of the field of seven, but was urged to the lead down the backstretch when the pace slowed. As they turned into the stretch, Salty mounted a brief challenge on the outside while Elate started closing ground on the rail. Smith guided Abel Tasman closer towards the rail, making it harder for Elate to go by. The two dueled for the final furlong with Abel Tasman prevailing by a head. The stewards mounted an inquiry about possible interference in the stretch run but allowed the results to stand. \\"It's just good, old-fashioned race riding\\", said Smith. \\"By no means did I put (Elate) in any harm. My filly really waits (for other horses to challenge her). Once she was in there, she was engaged. I made sure that I didn't touch (Elate). I made it tight, but there's no rules that say you can't make it tight.\\" Abel Tasman was then shipped to Parx Racing in Pennsylvania for the $1 million Cotillion Stakes on September 23. She broke slowly but then rushed up into second down the backstretch. She continued to duel with Lockdown for the lead as they entered the stretch, but meanwhile It Tiz Well mounted a strong move in the middle of the track and pulled ahead. Abel Tasman responded to the new challenge too late and finished second by two lengths. \\"She got real rank with (Smith), she took off with him it, and it was unfortunate\\", said Baffert. \\"It was a ridiculous run. We might have to take the blinkers off. I guess we just have to turn the page.\\" On November 3, Abel Tasman made her final start of the year in the Breeders' Cup Distaff, where she faced older horses for the first time. The favorite was Elate, who had won the Alabama and Beldame Stakes after finishing second to Abel Tasman in the Coaching Club American Oaks. The older horse division was led by champion Stellar Wind (Apple Blossom, Beholder Mile, Clement L. Hirsch) and Forever Unbridled (Fleur de Lis, Personal Ensign). Abel Tasman trailed the field for the first half mile, then swung wide around the final turn and started to close ground rapidly. However, Forever Unbridled had made an earlier move to hit the lead and was able to hold off Abel Tasman by half a length. \\"She ran her race\\", said Baffert. \\"She just got beat by a really good horse.\\" Abel Tasman was voted American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly for 2017. =2018: four-year-old season= After the Breeders' Cup, Abel Tasman was turned out for a few weeks of rest. Baffert did not rush her return as he planned to focus her campaign on the second half of the season and another chance at the Breeders' Cup Distaff. She made her four-year-old debut in the La Troienne Stakes at Churchill Downs on May 4, 2018, a year after her biggest win in the Kentucky Oaks. She was the only Grade I winner in the race and went off as the odds-on favorite. However, she raced wide throughout the race and lacked her normal closing kick, finishing fourth behind Salty. Abel Tasman made her next start in the Ogden Phipps Stakes on June 5 at Belmont Park, the same day Baffert would win the American Triple Crown with Justify. She stalked the early pace then moved to the lead on the backstretch when the pace slowed down. She maintained an easy lead around the turn then opened up down the stretch, eventually winning by lengths. \\"I'm so proud of her\\", said Baffert. \\"She's one of my favorite all-time horses.\\" Abel Tasman at the 2018 Breeders' Cup On August 25, Abel Tasman started in the Personal Ensign Stakes at Saratoga as the 3-5 favorite. Her main rival was Elate, the filly she had defeated the year before in the Coaching Club American Oaks after surviving a stewards' inquiry. After half a mile, Abel Tasman moved to the lead on a rail- hugging trip. Elate was racing behind her, then swung wide as they rounded the final turn. Elate started to close ground rapidly, getting to within half a length in mid stretch. Elate then started to drift out, then was guided back to her original path. Meanwhile, Abel Tasman moved away from the rail and the two fillies bumped. Elate lost her momentum and lost by a neck. Elate's jockey filed an objection but the steward's let the result stand. The result proved controversial, with the crowd booing Abel Tasman and Smith in the winner's circle. Elate's jockey José Ortiz stated, \\"He (Smith) clearly came out, knocked my filly off balance, knocked me off balance and beat me by a neck. I think [Abel Tasman] should have come down, 100 percent.\\" Smith disagreed, saying, \\"We just kind of came together, I didn't herd him [Ortiz] at all and she wasn't going to let him by no matter what.\\" Abel Tasman made her next start as the heavy favorite in the Zenyatta Stakes on September 30. She broke poorly and trailed the field early by ten lengths. Turning for home, she lacked her usual closing kick, finishing fifth. \\"I'm just really not sure what happened with her today\\", said Smith. \\"I'm kind of at a loss for words. The good thing is that she didn't get outrun. She didn't run period. For whatever reason she was lethargic loading and she was slow into stride and never wanted to pick it up.\\" On November 3, Abel Tasman was entered in the Breeders Cup Distaff, held in 2018 at Churchill Downs. Smith rode her aggressively from the gate and secured third place to the inside of Monomoy Girl going around the turn. She held her position down the backstretch but did not respond when Monomoy Girl started her drive, eventually finishing last. \\"She just quit running\\", said Baffert. \\"I thought she was in a good spot, (Smith) got aggressive with her, but she just doesn't want to run anymore, it looks like.\\" Retirement Abel Tasman was retired after the 2018 Breeders Cup. She was sold as a broodmare prospect at the Keeneland January 2019 Sales to Coolmore Stud for $5 million. She was subsequently bred to leading sire Galileo. Pedigree Abel Tasman is inbred 5S x 4D to Northern Dancer, meaning Northern Dancer appears in the fifth generation of the sire's side of the pedigree and in the fourth generation of the dam's side.

He was crowned Mr. Gay World India 2016, becoming the youngest winner of the crown at the age of 20. He represented India at the Mr. Gay World 2016 pageant held in Malta, Europe and made it to the Top 12. He is a recipient of the Troy Perry Award for compassionate activism, making him the first Indian to be honored with the award. He's a graduate in Electronics and Communication Engineering from IIIT Delhi, and is currently a Master's in Design student at NIFT, New Delhi.  Early life and education  Anwesh was born in Bhubaneswar, Odisha on 4 July 1995 to Jagannath Sahoo, an Engineer with NTPC, and Kanak Sahoo, a homemaker. Anwesh grew up in a small township of Kaniha in Odisha. At age 13, he and his parents moved to Noida, Uttar Pradesh. He completed his schooling at Vishwa Bharati Public School in Noida, and has mentioned of multiple instances of bullying throughout his school life in his interviews and blog posts. In an interview with Gaylaxy Magazine, he said how he had a very good childhood until he started middle school and the bullying intensified. He said his only escape was his books and the dream of acing his 12th boards. He went on to score 95% in his Higher Secondary Exams. He also secured an All India Rank of 15 in the National Institute of Fashion Technology's exam in 2018, and is a student of M.Des at NIFT, New Delhi. He came out as gay to his sister at the age of 16, and by the age of 18 had started writing a blog 'The Effeminare', to combat homophobia in his own little way and create awareness related to LGBTIQ issues in India. He went on to write an article called Under the Lucky Star for Pink- Pages, a National LGBT Magazine in India, where he came out to the readers and later on, also to his parents through the article. In his article he writes, \\"There is an underlying sense of security that only the walls of the closet can ensure. But then follows the phase of suffocation. The walls that once protected us begin to make us feel restricted. And what follows is the \\"end of self denial\\". This is when it all gets better.\\" He went on to write another article the following year for Pink-Pages called 'Growing Up Gay', where he spoke of how contrary to the reactions of people, growing up gay in India isn't half as bad. He continued to write for online forums that same year including 'That Time I Chose To be Gay' for Youth Youniverse and 'Miscellaneous Miley' for Artists at Work Productions' blog.  Career  Sahoo was a 3rd year engineering student at IIIT Delhi, when he was crowned Mr. Gay World India, and at 20 was the youngest contestant at the World pageant. His campaign Fitting Out gained widespread acclaim that year, garnering the highest marks at the World pageant. He was featured by Deutsche Welle, Germany's public international broadcaster where he spoke about coming out in a nation where indulging in homosexual acts could land you in jail. Post winning Mr. Gay World India, he became a part of the 50 Shades of Gay campaign shot by Shubham Mehrotra and was featured on the Gay Star News that year. He became the first former contributor of Pink Pages to feature on the cover of the magazine in its June 2016 issue. Anwesh later gained mainstream visibility due to a video he shot with Gaysi called Silly Questions Straight People Ask Gay Men that went viral over the Internet and was subsequently featured on numerous Indian and International websites including BuzzFeed India, Cosmopolitan India, Vagabomb and Logo TV's NEWNOWNEXT. Another video featuring him belly dancing to a popular Bollywood number 'My Name is Lakhan' went viral later that year in December, with popular websites and news outlets featuring him including Indian Express, Storypick, Queerty and Vagabomb. He also works as a writer for Swaddle, a parenting website where he writes on sexuality and gender related issues for parents. Some of his notable works on the site include, \\"What do you do if you think your child is Gay?\\", and \\"Gender and Sexuality Terms: A Sensitive Glossary for Parents\\". Anwesh has also written of his experience of being bullied online post winning the crown of Mr. Gay India, where he was criticized for not being 'pretty enough' and being 'too dark' to represent India on his blog The Effeminare, which was later published on Gaylaxy Magazine and covered by Pinksixty News. He also organized Delhi University's first pride walk in association with IIT Delhi's Annual fest Rendezvous to create awareness and promote acceptance for the LGBTIQ community. Anwesh has also been photographed by British photographer Olivia Arthur for a photo-series exploring sexuality in Mumbai, India which were later exhibited at the FOCUS Photography Festival, 2017 at Elysium Mansion, Colaba. Anwesh was named as one of the emerging LGBT Role Models of 2016 by Indian Women Blog, alongside transgender rights activist Laxmi Narayan Tripathi, and Business Analyst Himanshu Singh. He was the ambassador for 'Dance4Pride' event organized by Delhi-based organization Those in Need in association with Scruff in April 2017. He has featured in a social media campaign for Delhi-based brand Poem bags. Anwesh has been a contributor for DNA, India with his article called \\"The Problem with Stereotypes\\" which was published on 23 May 2017. He shared his coming out story in the article writing, \\"The problem with stereotypes isn't that they're wrong, it's that they are incomplete.\\" In July 2017, Sahoo featured in an ad film for Kraftly, an Indian e-commerce platform that specializes in buying and selling of unique products and brands. Anwesh also made an appearance in National Geographic Channel's Explorer Season 10, Episode 12 (uncredited), that released on 22 May 2017. On October 6th, 2018, Anwesh was awarded the Troy Perry Award for compassionate activism, in Los Angeles, California, making him the first Indian to be a recipient of this honor. He has been listed in Times India's list of 11 most inspiring LGBTIQA+ Indians with the likes of Vikram Seth and Keshav Suri, and in 2020 was featured in Vogue India in the list of 5 queer Indian influencers you should be following on Instagram. = TEDx Experience = Anwesh has spoken at 3 TEDx events: TEDxMAIS 2016 (Mallya Aditi International School, Bangalore), TEDxXIMB 2017 (Xavier's Institute of Management, Bhubaneswar), and TEDxCVS (College of Vocational Studies, Delhi University) . At the first event, Anwesh spoke of the need to break out of the Gender Binary. Through the talk, he challenged a world where sex and gender are often used interchangeably when in reality there exists a clear distinction between the two. He imagines a world where one's identity isn't limited to the binary male or female, but can manifest as a spectrum of infinite possibilities. His second TEDx talk, \\"Tapping into your Alice,\\" related to growing up in a society that did not know how to deal with those who did not conform to gender stereotypes, in addition to how adulthood drains us of our belief in magic. Anwesh's third talk was called, \\"Growing up gay in India, and learning to be confident\\", where he spoke of how \\"Effeminacy and femininity aren't euphemisms for indignity; being gay, femme, brown, being me, is sexy and powerful!\\".

Later on, their music became increasingly pop-oriented, as shown by their follow-up Calibrate, which was released by self-released in February 1983 through their own Pegna Records imprint. Although the band received local radio airplay, as well as having the music video for the track \\"Life Is Busy\\" played on MTV and Cinemax, the band met little to no fanphair. Tone Set would eventually cease to exist later in 1983, with both members going on to work on other projects. Galen Herod began a solo career and started the band Galen Herod and the Skin People. The duo would eventually work together again in the band Dumb But Happy, but they too broke up. During their existence, Tone Set performed shows under names such as Life Is Busy, The Art Farmers, and The Special Eds. They also contributed the track \\"Out!

The cost of renovating the factory was estimated at $60 million, and Vertex said that it would employ 1,300 people at full-scale production. In April 2015, Vertex Rail Technologies entered into a joint venture with Chinese manufacturer CRRC Corporation and Hong Kong-based private equity firm Majestic Legend Holdings, under which the manufacturing operation was named Vertex Railcar, CRRC provided railcar designs and some components, and Majestic Legend invested $6 million. Once Vertex received regulatory approval for and began manufacturing railcars, CRRC would be able to increase its stake to 50% by buying out the other stakeholders. Vertex received Association of American Railroads certification of its first railcar design, DOT-117 tank cars, in August 2015, followed by certification for its covered hopper design later in the year. It began building hopper cars, constructed of US and Chinese origin components, in September, and delivered the first of them in December. The company had orders for 3,100 hopper cars at the beginning of 2016, and planned to build up to 3,000 cars, including hopper, tank, and gondolas, during the year. In February 2016, Vertex launched a subsidiary to lease railcars to customers who preferred not to own them. However, weakening demand for sand used in hydraulic fracturing in petroleum extraction led Vertex to decrease construction of its hoppers cars, which were designed to transport the sand, and lay off workers at the Wilmington plant in May, leaving the company with 221 employees. In August 2016, at the request of a letter from 55 US House of Representatives members alleging that Vertex was being unfairly subsidized by the Chinese government by way of state-owned CRRC, the United States Department of the Treasury began an investigation into whether the Chinese investment in Vertex constituted a national security risk. 42 US Senators sent a similar letter in September, conveying concerns about the state-owned enterprises behind Vertex. The Treasury Department released its report in December and found that the joint ownership was not a risk. The company announced closure of plant and layoffs of remaining employees by end of 2018.

She was a cultural historian, a genealogist, and a repository of Hawaiian culture and history who wrote many articles and recollections about the past and influenced her husband, Albert Pierce Taylor, the author of the historical book Under Hawaiian Skies. She was involved in local philanthropic, historical, and civic groups and participated in the women's suffrage movement in the Territory of Hawaii, campaigning for the rights of local women to vote prior to the passage of the Nineteenth Amendment. Early life and family Emma Ahuena Davison was born on November 13, 1867, although her gravestone says she was born in 1866. She was the eldest daughter and second child of American pharmacist Benoni Richmond Davison—who became the superintendent of the United States Marine Hospital in Honolulu—and British-Hawaiian chiefess Mary Jane Kekulani Fayerweather. On her mother's side, she was a great-granddaughter of the British Captain George Charles Beckley and Ahia, a distant relation of the reigning House of Kamehameha. Davison's siblings included William Compton Malulani, Rose Compton, Henry Fayerweather, and Marie Hope Kekulani. Her father died in 1875 and her mother later married photographer A. A. Montano in 1877. Davison attended St. Andrew's Priory School in Honolulu, where she was taught by the sisterhoods of the Anglican Church of Hawaii established by King Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma. She later transferred to Fort Street School and became a playmate of Princess Kaʻiulani, the niece of King Kalākaua. Beginning in 1890, after finishing her education, she worked as a schoolteacher with her sister Rose at the government school in the Mānoa Valley. She married Albert Pierce Taylor on November 5, 1902, at her mother's Mānoa residence, becoming Taylor's second wife. Taylor, originally from the United States, settled in Hawaii and worked for The Pacific Commercial Advertiser and later became the librarian for the Archives of Hawaii. He was also a writer of Hawaiian history whose most notable work is Under Hawaiian Skies. They had no children. Literary career Emma Ahuena Taylor was an authority on Hawaiian history, genealogy, and language. With her mother, she planned and directed many historical pageants. Her husband's later works were greatly influenced by Taylor and her mother. In the 1920s, Taylor received a government appointment to the Hawaiian Historical and Hawaiian Folklore Commissions. The trustees of Bishop Museum and Kamehameha Schools consulted her and other Hawaiian scholars in the translation of Samuel Kamakau's seminal work Ruling Chiefs of Hawaii into English. Taylor and her husband became officers in the Hawaiian Historical Society. In September 1930, she wrote a paper and used it to address the society's annual meeting about the history and origin of the former Royal Tombs at Pohukaina. Located in the grounds of ʻIolani Palace, the site was abandoned when the bodies of the Hawaiian royal family were moved to the Royal Mausoleum at Mauna ʻAla during the reign of Kamehameha V, leaving behind many remains of the chiefs. Because of its importance Taylor argued; \\"...the site of the old royal tomb should be held in veneration, and that the historic mound should be cleared and exposed to public view, surrounded by an imposing guard fence, and an appropriate tablet set up to tell passersby its profound royal history\\". Following this meeting, the society submitted a resolution asking Governor Walter F. Frear to put a protective fence and plaque around the sacred site, which was done on October 17, 1930. Her other scholarly publications include; \\"Vengeance of Pele\\" (1930), the \\"Legend of Puahuula\\" (1930), and \\"Poki — Guardian Dog of Moanalua\\" (1935), all of which were written for Paradise of the Pacific magazine. The most notable characteristics of Taylor's writings were its personal touches and romantic depictions of the past, containing many vivid accounts drawn from her own life. In 1935, she wrote a series of eight weekly installments titled \\"Personal Recollections\\", in which she recounts life in Hawaii from her childhood in the 1870s until 1934, for the Honolulu Star-Bulletin. Eleanor H. Williamson notes: Community involvement In 1912, she became a supporter of the women's suffrage movement. Native Hawaiian women of high societal rank like Taylor were key early campaigners for this cause. In 1917, she attended a party hosted by Emma Nakuina to honor a visiting suffragist from the mainland United States, Almira Hollander Pitman, the wife of Taylor's cousin Benjamin F. Pitman. The presence of Taylor and other upper-class Honolulu suffragists—including Wilhelmine Widemann Dowsett, president of the National Women's Equal Suffrage Association of Hawaii—and subsequent meetings with the club prompted Pitman to write to her political connections in the mainland, which helped push a bill authorizing the Territory of Hawaii with the power to legislate on the issue of women's suffrage through Congress. In 1919, a local bill to enfranchise the women of Hawaii was planned but it never passed because the following year Congress passed the Nineteenth Amendment, granting all women in the United States the right to vote. During World War I, Taylor and her friend Emilie Widemann Macfarlane organized knitting units on behalf of Native Hawaiian soldiers. On September 23, 1921, Taylor wrote an article published in the Honolulu Advertiser that argued for Hawaii's recognition in a proposed Hall of Remembrance to be erected by the Woman's National Foundation in Washington, DC, honoring women from each of the then-forty-eight states. Speaking on behalf of the women of Hawaii, she advocated for Hawaii's spot in the proposed memorial, suggesting \\"a pillar of laval stone chiselled from the laval flows of Kilauea, be placed within this Hall of Remembrance to symbolize Hawaii\\" and for the recognition of the early pioneering American missionary wives, Queen Kaʻahumanu and High Chiefess Kapiʻolani. The pillar representing Hawaii was never erected. Taylor also supported many local organizations and was the premier of Māmakakaua (the Daughters and Sons of Hawaiian Warriors), a group composed of the descendants of the high chiefs (aliʻi) from the deposed monarchy. The group hosted pageants celebrating the history and traditions of Hawaii. Other organizations she became involved include the League of Women Voters, the Outdoor Circle, and the Native Daughters of Hawaii—which she helped organized. She was also elected the first female vice-president of the Manoa Percent Republican Club. In later life, Taylor befriended writer Beatrice Ayer Patton—the wife of General George S. Patton—who wrote The Blood of the Shark: A Romance of Early Hawaii, which was published in 1936 and loosely influenced by the exploits of Taylor's Hawaiian and British ancestors. Death Richard Weinberg described her in a 1936 interview about the art and craft of Ancient Hawaii in the Honolulu Star-Bulletin: \\"Mrs. Emma Ahuena Taylor impresses one as a person who has carried a strikingly handsome, youthful appearance into maturity.

The organization comprises a magazine called Christopher Kimball's Milk Street, a cooking school, Milk Street Radio, a website for video podcasts. as well as Milk Street Live! broadcasting live events. Name and location The organization is named after Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts, United States. It is headquartered in the Flour and Grain Exchange Building on Milk Street, which is in the Custom House District near Boston Harborwalk. History =America's Test Kitchen Lawsuit= When Kimball left America's Test Kitchen (ATK) and began Milk Street, he was sued by ATK for copying the concept and style of ATK. October 31, 2016, Boston Commons Press sued Kimball. The then- Brookline based company (now based in Boston), which owns America’s Test Kitchen (ATK) and Cook’s Country, filed a lawsuit in Suffolk Superior Court against Kimball that accuses him of \\"literally and conceptually ripped off America’s Test Kitchen\\". Boston Commons Press claims that Kimball was in breach of trust when he built his new business while still employed by ATK. They also claim that he used their company's recipes and databases to enable Milk Street to be in direct competition with ATK. Jack Bishop, the chief creative officer at ATK, stated that the Milk Street magazine was very similar to Boston Commons Press-owned Cook's Illustrated. Kimball founded that magazine and was editor until November 2015 when he left over a contract dispute. The lawsuit was settled in 2019. =Milk Street Cafe Lawsuit= Kimball's Milk Street Organization was also sued by Milk Street Cafe, owned by Marc Epstein, for trademark infringement. Epstein's Milk Street Cafe, established 35 years ago, is located nearby at 50 Milk Street. The lawsuit was decided in Kimball's favor.

Barnum Island is named after her. She set in motion several important government land transactions. As a result, she gained political importance, in an age where by law she could not even vote or hold office. By 1889, she was called \\"the best known woman on Long Island.\\" She got out of politics when newspapers ridiculed her maneuvers. Until then, Barnum was able to make or break political careers. She died on January 3, 1893.  Political career  Barnum was a driving force behind the development of Garden City, NY. She convinced the Town of Hempstead to sell land to A. T. Stewart, which he used to build Garden City. In her other well-known land transaction, she obtained the Barnum Island for the county as a working farm for the homeless. = Real estate transactions = In 1862, the New York State passed a law allowing Queens County towns to hold votes to sell land to developers. Farmers voted twice against Hempstead selling any land. In the runup to a third vote in 1869, Barnum used her position in the county's Agricultural Society's Ladies Aid organization to educate farmers about the benefits of the sale. The law required the proceeds to be used to fund education and social services. This would offset taxes currently collected to meet the town budget. Her canvassing led to a close vote in favor of the sale, allowing A. T. Stewart to successfully bid on the area. In 1874, Barnum found out that land speculators were planning to buy Hog Island and build a hotel resort. She had been discussing the status of the county poorhouse with county leaders, and the possibility of using Hog Island for it. The existing poorhouse in Freeport was substandard. During a storm, she found out about the development plans, immediately obtained the help of a neighbor to row across to Hog Island, and beat the developers with her own offer of $13,600 (far below the developers' budget). She turned around the property to the county at the same price, with no profit. A county-sponsored farm soon followed, bringing the poor and vagrants into better conditions, a chance at productivity, and (being an island) isolating them slightly from other population centers. The county renamed Hog Island in her honor. = Political rise = The two efforts in real estate helped her build strong working relationships with county supervisors, and she was treated as an \\"eighth member\\" of the board. Officeholders consulted with her frequently, and no candidate she endorsed ever lost an election. Barnum was also responsible for the establishment of a mental health facility in Mineola, in the old post office/court house. It was demolished in 1900. Barnum's influence, especially over the poor farm, was sometimes used to her personal advantage. She was known to take laborers from it for her own farm during the working summer months, and return them to the poor farm at the end of the season. Nevertheless, as head of a public/private partnership overseeing the farm, she made many reforms that were beneficial both to the poor and to the county treasury. She also had an 11-year-old orphan indentured to her by the county, despite the boy having foster parents and grandparents. He was not treated well, violating the indenture contract, which was later determined to be illegal regardless. At some point, her activities became notorious in the press, and she got out of politics. However, her brother, Francis B. Baldwin, was able to piggyback an influential political career on her previous unofficial position. He became a state assemblyman in 1878, then county treasurer.  Personal life  Barnum was a 7th-generation member of Hempstead's prominent Baldwin family. Her father was Thomas Baldwin. He settled in the Milburn section of Hempstead, opened several enterprises, and became the leading businessman of the area. In 1855, Milburn was renamed in honor of Thomas and his son Francis, eventually taking the name \\"Baldwin.\\" Sarah Ann was born c. 1815.Note that there are discrepancies in dates and ages from various newspaper accounts. Her reported January 1893 death at age 79 makes her birth year 1813 or possibly 1814. She is said to have first married at age 17, in 1833, which would date her birth to 1815 or 1816. Her first marriage was to Samuel Carmen in 1833, when she was 17. They had two daughters. He died in 1842. She remarried in 1846, to Peter \\"P. C.\\" Barnum, who had a farm and mansion along Front Street, in the East Meadow area of Hempstead. He owned several clothing stores in New York City (Manhattan), while allowing her to run the farm. She and Peter Barnum had two or three more children. One of these was a son named Joslin. Peter Barnum died in 1889. Sarah Barnum caught pneumonia on January 2, 1893. She died the next day, and was buried in Greenfield Cemetery. She was 79 years old.

Family  Kronenberg came from a wealthy family of Jewish rabbis. His father Samuel Eleazar Kronenberg (1773–1826) was a native of Wyszogród who led a small bank in Warsaw. His mother was Tekla, née Levi (1775–1848). Kronenberg had seven siblings: Ludwik, Rozalia, Stanislaw Solomon, Dorota (the mother of Seweryn Loewenstein), Maria, Henryk Andrzej, and Władysław Alfons. After graduating from high school in Warsaw, Kronenberg studied at the University of Technology in Hamburg and at the University of Berlin. Having finished his studies in 1832, he returned to Poland and took up conducting business. In 1846 he converted from Judaism to Protestantism. He married Ernestyna Rozalia Leo (1827–93), daughter of Leopold August Leo, a prominent Polish Jew who had converted to Lutheranism. They had six children: Stanisław Leopold (1846–94), entrepreneur; Władysław Edward (1848–92), musician and philanthropist; Leopold Julian (1849–1937), banker; Tekla Julia (1851–52); Maria Róża (1854–1944)—wife of Karol Zamoyski, and subsequently of Gustaw Taube—hostess of a famous Warsaw literary salon; and Rozalia (born 1857), wife of Aleksander Orsetti.  Business  From 1839 to 1860, having obtained the concession of the tobacco monopoly in the Kingdom of Poland, Kronenberg amassed a considerable fortune which he used to develop the country's economy: sugar industry, construction of railways, commercial activities, and banking sectors. He was also involved in the rural economy by participating in the work of the Agricultural Society. In 1859, Leopold Kronenberg made his entry into the world of the press by buying the newspaper Gazeta Codzienna, renamed in 1861 as Gazeta Polska. It was a magazine with a liberal-democratic tint, whose editor was Józef Ignacy Kraszewski. Kronenberg financially supported the January uprising of 1863 against the Russians. After the failure of this revolt, he became a representative of the \\"white\\" faction that favored a compromise with the Russians. In 1870, Kronenberg founded Bank Handlowy, the commercial bank of Warsaw, and in 1875 he founded the Warsaw School of Economics. He also founded the Credit Corporation of Warsaw, Industrial Cashier, Warsaw Fire Insurance Company, Coal Mine Association and Metallurgical Works. He was a shareholder in mining, metallurgical and sugar companies. He built many sugar factories, and in 1870 was the initiator of the establishment of the Warsaw Sugar Factory Association. He was a member of the National Debt Relief Commission, the Industrial Council of the Government Commission for Internal Affairs, and the Ministry of the Interior of the Kingdom of Poland. He was a member of the board of the Warsaw Stock Exchange, the Senior Merchants' Assembly, the chairman of the Warsaw-Tiraspol Railway Management Board. He was the president of the Warsaw Philanthropic Society. Between 1868 and 1871, he built in Warsaw a monumental home, Kronenberg Palace, which burned in September 1939 and was dismantled in the 1960s. Kronenberg died in 1878 in Nice. He was buried in the Kronenberg family chapel at the Evangelical-Reformed Cemetery in Warsaw.

The earliest documented use of the name was by Marcwardus de Hakkingin in 1156, a follower of the House of Babenberg, who named himself after the town of Hacking, which is now part of Vienna. It was also noted that the family was exceptionally large; over 100 members of the knighthood have been documented at the monastery in Klosterneuburg. Another early member was referenced in 1168 as Gerungus de Hakeing. Their origins prior to this is unknown, except that they had various landholdings and fiefdoms in the central Vienna valley (Wiental). Since the offspring of the Hackinger family also carried the title, indicates this was a hereditary line of knights. The family would also construct the fortress of Hacking (Veste Hacking) in the middle of the 13th century due to its strategic location. Hacking was the seat of this knightly family until the 13th century when the Russbachers purchased the land. Where the family seat moved at this time is unknown. Around, 1263, under Ottokar II of Bohemia, Tiemo von Russbach, son of Wernard von Russbach, changes his name to Tiemo von Hacking. This is the same year he took ownership of Hacking. His wife also takes on the name of Agnes von Hacking. Tiemo and his brother Gundaker would also use von Hacking as late as 1293. This is the last time this specific family line can be found in historical sources, and may have ended here or reverted to the Russbach name. Regardless, this newer Hackinger line had no relation to the older Hackinger line. The von Hacking family was linked by marriage with the Greiff family through Elisabeth von Hacking, daughter of Heinrich von Hacking, who married Otto Grief. The Greiffs were known to be a very wealthy Viennese family, also knights. There was also a very close connection with the Burggrafen (burgraves) von Gars the depth of which is unknown. All that is known is that Erkenbert von Gars expresses a very close connection with the von Hacking family. Between the 14th and 16th century records indicate numerous properties and land rights owned by the family. These lands include areas such as Auhof, Heiligenkreuz, Mauerbach, Schönbühel, Ranzenbach, Hilprechting, Hohenberg, Klammhof, Saag, Klosterneuburg, Uttendorf, and Ochsenburg. The most notable was Wilhelm von Hacking who owned several lands in upper Austria (Oberösterreich), many of which were given to him by Albert II of Germany (Archduke Albert V of Austria). In 1451, Georg Hackinger helped form the Mailberger Bund at Mailberg Castle, an alliance against King Frederick III in a dispute over the rightful reign of Ladislaus the Posthumous. The Hackinger name virtually vanishes from records until the 18th and 19th centuries, when it reappears with the greatest density in areas such as Austria (notably Upper Austria, Styria, and Burgenland) and Niederbayern, Germany. Names have also been found in Sopron, Hungary. The name continues to the present day in these areas. The disappearance of the name from records in the 16th century is not unusual. During the period known as the Military Revolution (1550–1660), nobles gradually lost their role in raising and commanding private armies, as many nations created cohesive national armies. This was coupled with a loss of the socio-economic power of the nobility, owing to the economic changes of the Renaissance and the growing economic importance of the merchant classes, which increased still further during the Industrial Revolution. In countries where the nobility was the dominant class, rich city merchants came to be more influential than noblemen, and the latter sometimes sought inter-marriage with families of the former to maintain their noble lifestyles. Today the Hackinger name is rare and highly concentrated in the specific areas mentioned previously, as such it is likely these are the offspring of the noble family. Coat of arms The coat of arms is described as a shield that is diagonally divided in the middle with a yellow or golden field above.

The Tōno City Board of Education conducted exploratory surveys in 1997, and the site came under city protection in 2000. The settlement consisted of 17 large pit houses, wells, and roads, with the houses arranged around a central square. Each house had a width of 4 to 6 meters, and a length of 8 to 14 meters, and the presence of multiple hearths seem to indicate that these were used by multiple family groups. A cemetery pit in the south end of the settlement yielded 50 earrings made of stone and bone, thought to have been produced from the Sea of Japan region of Japan.

He has been a United Resources Party member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea since 2012, representing the Bougainville Regional seat. Although regional members generally assume the position of Governor, due to the existence of the devolved Autonomous Bougainville Government Lera is referred to as the \\"Regional Member for Bougainville\\". He has been the Minister for Bougainville Affairs in the government of Peter O'Neill since April 2016. Lera is from Siwai in South Bougainville. He trained as a teacher at Vunakanau in East New Britain before returning to Bougainville to work as a teacher in 1976. Lera undertook adult matriculation at the University of Papua New Guinea, studied a Bachelor of Education degree at UPNG and Macquarie University in Australia before studying a master's degree in education at UPNG and the University of Goroka. He worked for the UPNG Open College flexible learning system for fifteen years, with his roles including director of their Buka campus and associate director professional and continuing education of the OC system, based at the main campus in Port Moresby. In 2007, he left the Open College system to serve as southern region commissioner for the Autonomous Bougainville Government, taking a significant pay cut. As an ABG commissioner, he initially oversaw the construction of government office accommodation and housing at Buin in South Bougainville, but faced major challenges in relation to water supply, power supply to Buin township, and a lack of roadmaking machinery in response to maintenance requests. By 2009, he reported that he had \\"completed 310 projects\\", including \\"61 feeder roads and 249 projects in primary schools, health centres, law and justice centres, school staff houses, aid posts, a successful cocoa pod-borer awareness throughout the districts, coffee workshops, sports, community outreach projects , long term impact projects that are still in progress and workshops to help the rural villagers on daily hygiene these were in the districts of Buin, Siwai and Bana.\\" He subsequently left the ABG, serving as chief executive director of Oil Search Limited's community development division. Lera was elected to the National Parliament at the 2012 election, winning the Bougainville Regional seat for the United Resources Party.

During World War II, it was part of the Civilian Pilot Training Act of 1939, to train civilian pilots to serve as contract labor in an auxiliary capacity for the military. The program lasted until 1944, during which 250,000 men and women had been certified as pilots by the contract schools. At the Douglas facility, 9,000 pilots had been certified between its opening in 1941 and its closing in 1944. The buildings that remain intact were listed on the National Register of Historic Places on May 14, 2013. Civilian Pilot Training Program As conditions led up to World War II, the United States joined European nations in strengthening its armed forces, which included the training of civilians for participation in the country's defense. The experimental Civilian Pilot Training Program (CPTP) had been operating since 1938, without the involvement of the military. When President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the Civilian Pilot Training Act on June 27, 1939, the military began setting up its own schools. The CPTP became the Civil Aeronautics Authority (CAA) War Training Service on December 7, 1942. The civilians who were certified as pilots through the program served as an auxiliary contract labor force in addition to the existing military strength. By 1944 when the combined civilian and military training programs ended, 435,000 men and women had qualified as pilots at 1,460 flight schools, and 1,132 colleges and universities. Of those figures, 250,000 were trained at 75 Contract Pilot flight schools. Construction and management The 63rd Army Air Forces Contract Pilot School was built and administered by different levels of government and civilian entities. The city of Douglas and Coffee County jointly purchased the land in 1941 and retained responsibility for clearing and maintaining the acreage. Oversight of the construction and daily operations of the school were contracted to the civilian Raymond-O'Neal Aviation Company, partnered by Wesley Newman Raymond and B. P. O'Neal. The United States Army Corps of Engineers reviewed and approved the building design by Miami architect Stefan H. Zachar. Construction by private Miami contractor C. Franklin Wheeler commenced in July 1941. Both the architect and contractor had previously built a primary training school for the 53d Flying Training Detachment at what is now Carlstrom Field in Florida. Cost overruns led to partner O'Neal resigning, and being replaced by George Brinckerhoff to form the Raymond-Brinckerhoff Aviation Company. The Defense Plant Corporation (DPC) was created in 1940 as a subsidiary of Reconstruction Finance Corporation for the purpose of financing war time endeavors that might not prove profitable once the war ended. DPC would then lease the facilities to private companies to operate the businesses. With that method, DPC assumed the fixed assets of Raymond-Brinckerhoff Aviation Company on January 2, 1942, and the aviation partners in turn leased the facilities to operate the school. George Brinckerhoff resigned in July, and Robert Richardson became Raymond's partner. Training and the facilities Front of the building The Contract Pilot School in Douglas, Georgia was constructed as a primary training school on a tract in 1941–1943. In this case, \\"primary\\" training meant that the potential civilian pilots already had some measure of basic flight instructions before arriving. The Douglas school gave them 100 hours of classroom instruction that included basic instrument training with the Link Trainer. Following that, they were given lessons in flying the PT-17 biplane, and learned to solo. In order to graduate, the civilian pilots needed 60 hours of flying time and 175 landings. The military construction in the United States during World War II was usually intended for temporary usage, only built to last out the conflict. Speed, minimal expense and functionality dominated as prefabricated wooden buildings were erected to meet the immediate needs. By contrast, the school in Douglas was built with concrete and clay- like tiles, thereby ensuring that many of the structures have survived into the 21st Century. Construction began in August on the sod landing strip, with a second landing strip finished before the end of 1941. In October, the first classroom opened to 50 students. Seventeen more buildings would follow, including living quarters for the pilots and a mess hall. Both men and women students were accepted, and the school grounds eventually accommodated recreational activities. Within two years of its opening, the training facilities employed 1,000 people at expenses in excess of $1,000,000 annually. Graduations were celebrated, and social and athletic events were part of the lifestyle. The government closed down the schools in 1944 to concentrate its forces in the war zones. The 63rd Army Air Forces Contract Pilot School at Douglas had successfully trained 9,000 pilots by the time it closed on December 28, 1944.

Segal, Yudika, and Kadia Molodowsky, the painter Louis Muhlstock, and, in the 1940s and beyond, Melech Ravitch, Rokhl Korn and other refugees and survivors from Nazi Europe. Maze was at the center of Montreal's Yiddish language artistic community, both through the salon at her home and through reading groups and other programs she ran at the Jewish Public Library. She assisted others in the Jewish community with their literary work, finding employment, or arranging visas and permits. One of those writers she assisted was a teenage Miriam Waddington, who later recalled, \\"She gave herself entirely and attentively to the poem; she fed the spiritual hunger and yearning of these oddly assorted Yiddish writers whenever they needed her.\\"  References  Massey, Irving.

Bioinformatics deals with computational and mathematical approaches for understanding and processing biological data. Prior to the emergence of machine learning algorithms, bioinformatics algorithms had to be explicitly programmed by hand which, for problems such as protein structure prediction, proves extremely difficult. Machine learning techniques such as deep learning enable the algorithm to make use of automatic feature learning which means that based on the dataset alone, the algorithm can learn how to combine multiple features of the input data into a more abstract set of features from which to conduct further learning. This multi-layered approach to learning patterns in the input data allows such systems to make quite complex predictions when trained on large datasets. In recent years, the size and number of available biological datasets have skyrocketed, enabling bioinformatics researchers to make use of these machine learning systems. Machine learning has been applied to six biological domains: genomics, proteomics, microarrays, systems biology, evolution, and text mining.  Applications  = Genomics = The exponential growth of GenBank, a genomic sequence database provided by the National center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Genomics involves the study of the genome, the complete DNA sequence, of organisms. While genomic sequence data has historically been sparse due to the technical difficulty in sequencing a piece of DNA, the number of available sequences is growing exponentially. However, while raw data is becoming increasingly available and accessible, the biological interpretation of this data is occurring at a much slower pace. Therefore, there is an increasing need for the development of machine learning systems that can automatically determine the location of protein-encoding genes within a given DNA sequence. This is a problem in computational biology known as gene prediction. Gene prediction is commonly performed through a combination of what are known as extrinsic and intrinsic searches. For the extrinsic search, the input DNA sequence is run through a large database of sequences whose genes have been previously discovered and their locations annotated. A number of the sequence's genes can be identified by determining which strings of bases within the sequence are homologous to known gene sequences. However, given the limitation in size of the database of known and annotated gene sequences, not all the genes in a given input sequence can be identified through homology alone. Therefore, an intrinsic search is needed where a gene prediction program attempts to identify the remaining genes from the DNA sequence alone. Machine learning has also been used for the problem of multiple sequence alignment which involves aligning many DNA or amino acid sequences in order to determine regions of similarity that could indicate a shared evolutionary history. It can also be used to detect and visualize genome rearrangements. = Proteomics = A protein's amino acid sequence annotated with the protein secondary structure. Each amino acid is labeled as either an alpha helix, a beta sheet, or a coil. Proteins, strings of amino acids, gain much of their function from protein folding in which they conform into a three-dimensional structure. This structure is composed of a number of layers of folding, including the primary structure (i.e. the flat string of amino acids), the secondary structure (alpha helices and beta sheets), the tertiary structure, and the quartenary structure. Protein secondary structure prediction is a main focus of this subfield as the further protein foldings (tertiary and quartenary structures) are determined based on the secondary structure. Solving the true structure of a protein is an incredibly expensive and time-intensive process, furthering the need for systems that can accurately predict the structure of a protein by analyzing the amino acid sequence directly. Prior to machine learning, researchers needed to conduct this prediction manually. This trend began in 1951 when Pauling and Corey released their work on predicting the hydrogen bond configurations of a protein from a polypeptide chain. Today, through the use of automatic feature learning, the best machine learning techniques are able to achieve an accuracy of 82-84%. The current state-of-the-art in secondary structure prediction uses a system called DeepCNF (deep convolutional neural fields) which relies on the machine learning model of artificial neural networks to achieve an accuracy of approximately 84% when tasked to classify the amino acids of a protein sequence into one of three structural classes (helix, sheet, or coil). The theoretical limit for three-state protein secondary structure is 88–90%. Machine learning has also been applied to proteomics problems such as protein side-chain prediction, protein loop modeling, and protein contact map prediction. = Microarrays = Microarrays, a type of lab-on-a-chip, are used for automatically collecting data about large amounts of biological material. Machine learning can aid in the analysis of this data, and it has been applied to expression pattern identification, classification, and genetic network induction. A DNA-microarray analysis of Burkitt's lymphoma and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is shown and identifies differences in gene expression patterns. This technology is especially useful for monitoring the expression of genes within a genome, aiding in diagnosing different types of cancer based on which genes are expressed. One of the main problems in this field is identifying which genes are expressed based on the collected data. In addition, due to the huge number of genes on which data is collected by the microarray, there is a large amount of irrelevant data to the task of expressed gene identification, further complicating this problem. Machine learning presents a potential solution to this problem as various classification methods can be used to perform this identification. The most commonly used methods are radial basis function networks, deep learning, Bayesian classification, decision trees, and random forest. = Systems biology = Systems biology focuses on the study of the emergent behaviors from complex interactions of simple biological components in a system. Such components can include molecules such as DNA, RNA, proteins, and metabolites. Machine learning has been used to aid in the modelling of these complex interactions in biological systems in domains such as genetic networks, signal transduction networks, and metabolic pathways. Probabilistic graphical models, a machine learning technique for determining the structure between different variables, are one of the most commonly used methods for modeling genetic networks. In addition, machine learning has been applied to systems biology problems such as identifying transcription factor binding sites using a technique known as Markov chain optimization. Genetic algorithms, machine learning techniques which are based on the natural process of evolution, have been used to model genetic networks and regulatory structures. Other systems biology applications of machine learning include the task of enzyme function prediction, high throughput microarray data analysis, analysis of genome-wide association studies to better understand markers of disease, protein function prediction. = Stroke Diagnosis = Machine learning methods for analysis of neuroimaging data are used to help diagnose stroke. Three-dimensional CNN and SVM methods are often used. = Text mining = The increase in available biological publications led to the issue of the increase in difficulty in searching through and compiling all the relevant available information on a given topic across all sources. This task is known as knowledge extraction. This is necessary for biological data collection which can then in turn be fed into machine learning algorithms to generate new biological knowledge. Machine learning can be used for this knowledge extraction task using techniques such as natural language processing to extract the useful information from human-generated reports in a database. Text Nailing, an alternative approach to machine learning, capable of extracting features from clinical narrative notes was introduced in 2017. This technique has been applied to the search for novel drug targets, as this task requires the examination of information stored in biological databases and journals. Annotations of proteins in protein databases often do not reflect the complete known set of knowledge of each protein, so additional information must be extracted from biomedical literature. Machine learning has been applied to automatic annotation of the function of genes and proteins, determination of the subcellular localization of a protein, analysis of DNA- expression arrays, large-scale protein interaction analysis, and molecule interaction analysis. Another application of text mining is the detection and visualization of distinct DNA regions given sufficient reference data.

History Francis Champion emigrated to South Australia in 1855; his elder brother Richard Champion emigrated with his family around the same time, possibly on the same ship. Francis Champion, and perhaps also his brother, worked for a time at the Sturt Street soap and candle factory of Moore & Tidmarsh (nominally 1849–1859, but in reality Tidmarsh's company from 1852), and left their employ to start his own factory. They purchased Lot 1866, of Section 354 in the township of Bowden (Gibson Street?) from Edward Kelly in 1860 and immediately set about erecting buildings and installing the vats necessary for rendering fat and tallow from butchers' scraps. A civil action was brought before the local court by one Dixon against the company for damages, claiming loss of enjoyment and loss of value of their residence occasioned by the smells emanating from the factory, situated some 200 or 300 yards (or metres) distant. The case was heard on 20 April 1864, and non-suited after a greater number of witnesses claimed not to have been inconvenienced, and to the fact that the smell was not injurious to health. The case was brought to the Supreme Court before Justice Boothby the following June, when Mr. Dixon revealed that he was being backed financially by John Howard Angas, and they intended using the courts to break the Champions financially if they could not force them to relocate. Dixon also objected to the sign on the Champions' building, which he found offensive. Angas had purchased from his father the fine residence \\"Prospect Hall\\" on nearby Torrens Road at the corner overlooking the Park Lands (not to be confused with J. B. Graham's \\"Prospect House\\", aka \\"Graham's Castle\\" on Prospect Road, Prospect). The court found for the plaintiff, but only awarded him damages of one shilling. The case aroused a great deal of public sympathy, and in response to an advertisement a well-attended public meeting was held at the Hotel Europe chaired by the Mayor Sam Goode. Speakers decried the ability of the well-heeled to control where and how tradesmen could pursue their trades, and considered this case the \\"thin end of the wedge\\". A collection was held to defray the Champions' court costs. The case gained some importance in the field of town planning. The partnership was dissolved October 1864, and with the announcement the brothers thanked their supporters. By 1867 F. H. Champion had re-established the factory on River Street Hindmarsh, where other businesses of a similar nature, such as Peacock and Son, and Bean Brothers, were already established. The business operated until 1882, when it closed, hastened perhaps by the appearance on nearby Adam Street of the Apollo Soap and Stearine Company, a large interstate competitor. George Wilcox (1838–1917) was managing director of Apollo's Adelaide factory, which was taken over by Burford's in 1887, with Thomas Mossop (c. 1818–1896) as manager, after an economic recession which closed many businesses.

Strictly speaking, according to evolutionary anthropologists and archaeologists, there is not a single hominin Paleolithic diet. The Paleolithic covers roughly 2.8 million years, concurrent with the Pleistocene, and includes multiple human ancestors with their own evolutionary and technological adaptations living in a wide variety of environments. This fact with the difficulty of finding conclusive of evidence often makes broad generalizations of the earlier human diets very difficult. Our pre-hominin primate ancestors were broadly herbivorous, relying on either foliage or fruits and nuts and the shift in dietary breadth during the Paleolithic is often considered a critical point in hominin evolution. A generalization between Paleolithic diets of the various human ancestors that many anthropologists do make is that they are all to one degree or another omnivorous and are inextricably linked with tool use and new technologies. Background Due to the variety of environments inhabited, physiologies of the humans and human ancestors alive during the Paleolithic over 2.8 million years, we can’t ascribe a single set diet to any species, regional or cultural group. Larger brain sizes required a greater caloric intake. In colder climates meat might be necessary due to the decreased availability of plant based foods, and in hotter tropical climates a wider range of plants would be available. Evolution of hominins Recents estimates of the last common ancestors of humans and chimpanzees are around 12 million years ago. After this split the first bipedal hominins appeared around 4 million years ago in the genus Australopithecus.The first appearance of genus Homo takes place around 2.8 million years ago with Homo habilis, followed by Homo erectus at around 1.8 million years ago, Homo neanderthalensis by 400,000 years ago and finally the first appearance of Homo sapiens by 200,000 years ago. In each new species of hominin, particularly genus Homo there is a general trend of increasing brain size and decreasing dentition, these patterns are inextricably linked with an evolving diet. Lines of evidence to uncover the diet of human ancestors There are numerous difficulties in detecting and understanding the ancient diet of human ancestors. The Paleolithic begins around 2.6 million years ago and ends only around 12,000 years ago with the onset of the Holocene and Neolithic. The enormous time scale, variable environments inhabited by human ancestors and issues with preservation ensure that direct evidence is often very difficult to come by. Evolutionary anthropologists who study the evolution of human origins and diet use a variety of methods to determine what human ancestors ate. As a starting point comparative analysis of the diets of humans closest living relatives, great apes such as chimpanzees, bonobos and other great apes, though these comparison are limited. Through environmental reconstruction of the areas ancient humans lived, inferences of available resources can be made. A common method of analysis is through the study of dentition and toothwear, as different foods will leave different markers that can be studied. There is also direct archaeological evidence, different types of tools would be used to process and consume different types of food and often be associated with faunal remains and evidence of fire. Human coprolites can also reflect direct evidence of diet. More recent techniques have been introduced such as carbon isotopic analysis of recovered bones, which can be used as direct evidence of diet, and life history traits. An example would be the expensive tissue hypothesis, linking a decrease in gut size with an increase in brain size. Recently genetic studies of differences between Homo sapiens and other related hominins to determine adaptations related to diet. Hominin diet before the Paleolithic Generally speaking, inferring feeding adaptations in fossil hominins is not a simple task, and hence diet reconstructions have relied on diverse techniques (e.g. microwear, stable isotopes, functional morphology, etc.) that have provided different or even contradictory results. The direct predecessors to genus Homo, Australopithecus are thought to have broadly been frugivores or herbivores. The dental and jaw morphology of Australopithecus afarensis have often been assumed to indicate a diet of harder brittle foods, however tooth wear analysis from some specimen reflect a diet of tough grasses and leaves. This is corroborated by stable carbon isotopic evidence indicating the consumption of plants found along riversides and under tree cover. A recent study that analysed several hominin taxa has shown that they were probably no hard-food specialists, most likely relying on a softer diet. Homo naledi, Homo habilis, Homo floresiensis and Homo erectus = Homo naledi = Almost half of H. naledi teeth have one or more chips on the enamel surface, caused by teeth coming into contact with hard foods or environmental grit during life. These antemortem enamel fractures are predominantly small and on the surfaces between molars, suggesting either a small hard dietary item was commonly consumed, or, more likely, environmental grit was incorporated into their diet when eating foods such as tubers. Two other studies support the suggestion that H. naledi consumed large quantities of small hard objects, most likely in the form of dust or grit. Crown shape supports this finding, with taller crowned and more wear resistant molars, potentially evolving to protect against abrasive particles. Microwear on the molars of H. naledi also suggests they regularly consumed hard and abrasive items. Overall, it is likely H. naledi differed substantial from other African fossil hominins in terms of diet, behaviour, or masticatory processing. =Homo habilis= By 3 million years ago the broad pattern of human dentition was in place with reduced canines and a jaw morphology implying heavier chewing. Stone tools and butchered animal remains dating to 2.6 million years ago have been found together in Ethiopia. This finding provides both the clearest evidence of meat eating by early human ancestors and the association of earliest stone tools with the butchering of animals for meat and marrow. This co-occurrence of stone tools is clearly linked with the butchering of animals and earliest identifiable appearances of Homo habilis. Tooth wear from Homo habilis indicates a relative lack of hard foods such as nuts, tubers or other hard brittle plant material being consumed. This is not to say that no tougher foods were eaten by H. habilis, only that it was likely not a regular part of the diet. By contrast, Homo erectus teeth generally reflect a much higher degree of wear, indicating tougher plant foods being eaten. While likely able to consume a variety of plant and animal resources, it seems that H. habilis was not able to exploit the wide array of resources and ecological niches its descendants would be able to. =Homo erectus= In contrast to Homo habilis, H. erectus left its ancestral environment of Africa and spread through much of the old world. Homo erectus appears to have avoided other large predators. Several interpretations of Homo erectus diet have been made, usually contrasting between primarily plant based foragers and scavengers or opportunistic hunters. However, as H. erectus dispersed across Eurasia some behaviors in some areas appear to have changed. The trajectory of diets between Homo habilis and Homo erectus can be described as a diversification of diet as Homo erectus spread within Africa and beyond into Asia. Meat played a critical role in the evolution of H. habilis, but as Homo erectus evolved the diet broadened to include tougher foods that H. habilis did not consume regularly. A broad diet alone however is not Homo erectus' sole contribution to evolution of the human lineage. Genetic evidence of reduced jaw muscles implies the adoption of cooking by humans prior to the branching of H. sapiens and H. neanderthalensis, placing the first use of fire for cooking firmly during the time of Homo erectus. Fire presents clear advantages to a species diet, in that cooking allows a greater range of foods to be eaten and improves the caloric content of both animal protein and plants. =Homo floresiensis= Homo floresiensis is thought to have diverged from humanity's ancestral branch prior to the evolution of Homo erectus. The direct ancestor of Homo floresiensis is currently thought to be Homo habilis, but this is subject to change with new information. Tooth wear from Homo floresiensis implies a tough, fibrous diet requiring powerful mastication. There is some evidence of meat eating associated with Homo floresiensis, but current evidence indicated that a plant based diet dominated. The specific plant species available to H. floresiensis is currently unknown. This complicates H. floresiensis relationship to H habilis, due to the latter’s association with intensive meat eating diet. That being the case, more than enough time passed for H. floresiensis diet to specialize to its given environment. Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis =Homo heidelbergensis= Homo heidelbergensis, the likely predecessor of Homo neanderthalensis has few direct clues to its diet. Two adult incisors, likely from H. heidelbergensis have been found in England in an environment that at death would have been a spring fed wetland. The teeth themselves are heavily worn, implying heavy wear in the individual’s diet. Wooden spears dating to between 380,000 and 400,000 years BP were found in Germany, indicating that H. heidelbergensis was a big game hunter with sophisticated technology. =Homo neanderthalensis= Neanderthals were almost certainly effective hunters. Multiple sites associated with H. neanderthalensis also have the remains of butchered animals. More direct stable isotope evidence from Neanderthal bodies also indicates a heavy, though by no means exclusive reliance on animal protein. The degree to which Neanderthals rely on meat in their diet is extensively debated with contradictory evidence found often at very similar sites. Worn teeth from Neanderthal remains at a variety of sites imply use of plant and other abrasive foods, while other researchers find that Neanderthal tooth wear in general indicates a varied diet of both plants and meat. There is clear evidence of the consumption and processing of ancestors of wheat and barley by Neanderthals from starch analysis of from dental calculus, while in Belgium, a species related to Sorghum was consumed along with other unknown plants. At the site of Shanidar in Iraq, in addition to the ancestors of wheat and barley, Homo neanderthalensis is known to have consumed dates, legumes and a variety other unknown plant species. In addition, evidence exists from the same teeth of Neanderthals to support the increased use of fire in their diet in addition to the wide variety of plant and animals in their diet. Evidence from Neanderthal coprolites from a Middle Paleolithic site in Spain support a diet of animal protein and plants at that site, though there is a lack of indicators for the consumption of starchy tubers. Neanderthals at El Sidron cave in Spain appear to have a more limited diet of meat when compared to other Neanderthal groups. In February 2019, scientists reported evidence, based on isotope studies, that at least some Neanderthals may have eaten meat. Nonetheless, instead of diet dominated by meat eating, the genetic and microbiological evidence from dental calculus implies reliance on mushrooms, pine nuts and a species of moss. The implications of this array of evidence is important due to the evidence that the “broad spectrum” of plant use is not unique to Homo sapiens. Homo neanderthalensis had, for all intents and purposes, a complex diet similar to many hunter-gather groups of Homo sapiens. The critical factor in this diet was that it varies significantly based on the local environment. Homo sapiens The evidence of early Homo sapiens diet stems from multiple lines of evidence, and there is a relative abundance of information due to both a larger relative population footprint and more recent evidence. A key contribution to early human diet likely was the introduction of fire to hominins toolkit. Some studies indicate a correlation with the introduction of fire and the reduction of tooth and gut size, going so far as to indicate their reduction as clear evolutionary indicators of the widespread introduction of fire. A key difference between the diets of Homo sapiens and our closest extinct relatives H. neanderthalensis is the ability to effectively digest cooked starches, with some evidence found linking cooked starch and a further increase in H. sapiens brain size. Roots and tubers were introduced into the broader human diet, and can likely be assumed to be associated with fire as cooking would likely be necessary for many tubers to be digested. The use of root and tuber species in some Hunter Gatherer cultures makes up a critical component of diet. This is not only for the nutritional value of the species, but the relative annual stability of the species. This buffer effect would be important for many groups that relied on tubers. The ability to process starch is linked genetically to modern humans, with the genes necessary to its consumption not found in H. neanderthalensis. The timing of this mutation on modern humans is important as it means the ability to digest heavily starchy foods has only developed in the last 200ky years. In addition to the exploitation of tubers, another dietary innovation (this far) of Homo sapiens is the introduction of coastal and other marine resources. Some researchers have argued that the introduction of shellfish and other marine species play a significant role in the evolution of modern Homo sapiens. By the upper Paleolithic, more complex tools and a higher proportion of meat in the human diet are assumed to correlate with an expansion of population in Europe. Though the diet of modern humans is not consistent through the Upper Paleolithic. From the Middle to Late Pleistocene there is a general shift in many areas towards a less abrasive diet. This is accompanied by changing technologies that would aid in the processing of abrasive plant species. Ethnographic comparisons with contemporary groups of Hunter Gatherers broadly imply a high reliance on animal protein supplemented with a wide range of available plant foods. While a reliance on animal protein is often seen as typical, it is by no means universal. By the time of the Upper Paleolithic and modern Homo sapiens, not only was a wide variety of plants consumed, but a wide variety of animals, snails and fish. In order to exploit the many different species consumed, there was a wider variety of tools made than ever before available to humans. The shift to a higher quality diet and the technology to process a wide array of foods is reflected in modern humans by both the relatively larger brain size and reduction in gut size. The trend of larger brain size, the eating of animal protein, fire use and diversification of exploited foods is key to understanding the changing diets of human ancestors. Cannibalism Debates over the frequency of cannibalism in ancient humanity have been sporadic, usually erupting on the discovery of human with cut and break marks reflective of being processed as food. Evidence of cannibalism has been tied to both Homo sapiens and Homo neanderthalensis. Many theories of cannibalism amongst humans rely on a lack of available prey, crowding and fears of potential starvation. There are clear biological drawbacks of cannibalism including disease, and in addition instances of ritual cannibalism that have nothing to do with nutrition drawn from the ethnographic record. Evidence from Neanderthal remains in Belgium features cracked bones, cut marks and other indicators of processing for food. Notably, reindeer remains from the same site have the same types of butcher marks. The degree to which these remains reflect a ritual behavior, regular diet or isolated instances of dietary distress is not known. Neolithic adaptations The evolution of the human diet has not stopped since the end of the Paleolithic. Major functional adaptations have arisen in the last few thousand years as human technology has altered the environment. The most prevalent dietary adaptation since the Neolithic is lactase persistence, an adaptation that allows humans to digest milk. This adaptation appears roughly 4000 years ago in Europe. For populations more dependent on agriculture and domesticated animals, the importance of being able to add another edible resource should be noted. General trends Many specifics of the evolution of the human diet change regularly as new research and lines of evidence become available. Through the Paleolithic across the last 2.8 million years there has been a pattern of human and human ancestor’s biology adapting to an additionally available food source with resulting greater brain size, with the subsequent broadening and diversification of human diet. Homo habilis incorporated larger amounts of animal protein and fat into its diet, then as Homo erectus evolved it increased the breadth of its diet through fire and more advanced tool use. Homo sapiens in turn evolved the ability to consume cooked starch and marine life, which led to a further increase in brain size then greater technological diversification that ultimately allowed modern humans to adapt to a wide variety of ecological niches. The initial technological and biological adaptations each have knock on effects that allow a greater range of species to be used as food. This culminates in the Neolithic when suites of plants and animals are ultimately domesticated. In short, if there is a clear universal human Paleolithic diet, it is the use of fire to cook food.

The game was developed by Sensible Object and released in November 2016, its soundtrack was composed by Disasterpeace. Originally titled Fabulous Beasts, the game had to be renamed following a trademark dispute with Warner Bros. over their Fantastic Beasts film. Gameplay The game can be played solo, or co-operatively by up to 4 players. The aim of the game is to stack animal-shaped objects onto a plinth in order to build a tower. Each object is RFID tagged; these tags are read by the plinth, and communicated to the companion app via Bluetooth, allowing the app to keep score and set challenges. When the tower topples, a countdown begins, and if the players fail to re-create the tower before the timer runs out, the game ends. The game can be extended with new animals which may be purchased individually, such as a Yogscast-inspired lion. An RFID sticker pack allows players to incorporate any object into the game. Development Alex Fleetwood, founder of Sensible Object, describes the game as an evolution of a project from his previous company, Hide&Seek.; Sensible Object received seed funding from the Arts and Humanities Research Council through their React programme. The React programme allowed the team to collaborate with University of Bath academics, and gave access to Young Coaches, children aged 7–12 who acted as playtesters. The initial prototype was built in four months. Sensible Object explored using computer vision to track the stacked objects, but moved to a simpler method combining RFID tags in the objects and a weight sensor in the plinth. The game was prototyped on an Ultimaker 2 3D printer. Tim Burrell- Saward, one of the game's designers, described the importance of prototypes to their process: \\"We did lots of 3D printing – we couldn't have done this game without access to that. You can design something on screen or on paper, but it isn't until you have it in your hands that you can play with it and see if it's weighted corectly or if the angles are too hard\\". The game's electronics were prototyped with Arduino components, and the mobile apps were built in Unity. The game was partly funded through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign, raising £168,360 towards the game's development in February 2016. In June 2016, the game was renamed from Fabulous Beasts to Beasts of Balance following a trademark dispute with Warner Bros. over their Fantastic Beasts film. The game was demoed at multiple events throughout its development, including the Game Developers Conference, Spiel, and the American International Toy Fair. At the 2015 Indiecade festival, it won the Technology Award. The game was released in November 2016. Reception Writing in The Guardian, Stuart Dredge awarded the game 4/5 stars. He described how the game was able to maintain the interest of his 7 and 9 year old sons, but did note how they would argue over whose fault it was following a tower collapse. Matt Jarvis, in his review for Tabletop Gaming magazine, highlighted how the challenges presented by the app could introduce difficulty for experienced players, and how the scoring system introduced an element of strategy to the gameplay. He concluded that the game was \\"one of the finest examples of physical and digital gameplay working together yet\\".

The $31 million facility opened in 2005 and is managed by SMG. The convention center was first proposed in the 1980s, but was rejected by voters on three occasions; the formation of a public facilities district in 1999 funded its construction. History Lynnwood, historically a bedroom community of Seattle and nearby Everett, began pursuing a convention center and performing arts venue in the late 1960s. Boosters from the Edmonds Community College attempted to lure a state-sponsored \\"festival center\\" in 1977, but failed to garner support over a site near Federal Way. A 3,000-seat arts-and-convention center on the college campus was also proposed in 1980, but failed to receive funds from the Washington State Legislature. In the November 1982 election, voters in south Snohomish County (including Lynnwood and nearby cities) rejected the formation of a special district to develop the arts-and-convention center, and also repealed a local sales tax, planned to be used to fund its construction. The boosters later decided against scheduling another public vote on the arts-and-convention center, and ultimately decided in 1985 to split the projects into two: a performing arts center on the college campus, and a convention center elsewhere in Lynnwood. A ballot measure was attempted again in 1988, but failed because of low voter turnout. A second, major campaign to build an 800-seat, $45 million arts-and- convention center in Lynnwood began in 1998. The proposal was sent to local voters in May 1998, with mixed support from politicians, and was rejected by 75 percent. In 1999, the city government established a public facilities district, a type of local special district that would be able to fund a convention center using a state sales tax rebate. The estimated cost of the convention center led the city to reconsider its plans in 2000, instead opting for a smaller, facility costing $32 million. The final design for the convention center, with of total meeting space, was unveiled to the public in November 2002. The convention center was funded by $27.9 million in issued bonds, as well as rebate sales taxes from the state government and hotel-motel taxes collected by the county and city. Construction on the convention center began in October 2003. Howard S. Wright Companies was selected to build the facility, while SMG was awarded the rights to operate it. The convention center opened on April 30, 2005, and immediately came into competition with the Everett Events Center (now Xfinity Arena) in downtown Everett. After completion of the convention center, the Lynnwood Public Facilities District attempted to build a 200-room Hilton Garden Inn hotel on an adjacent property. The proposed hotel was scrapped in 2008 after the main developer withdrew from negotiations, citing the then-ongoing financial crisis. By then, the convention center had an annual attendance of 82,000 people. In its first decade in operation, the Lynnwood Convention Center hosted over 3,900 events and a total attendance of 753,000 people. An estimated $24.8 million in economic impact was generated by the convention center in 2014. Facilities The Lynnwood Convention Center is located on 196th Street Southwest, a block west of Interstate 5 in central Lynnwood. It is southwest of the Alderwood Mall, and within the city's planned city center. The convention center has a total floor space of , and a grand hall that can accommodate 1,200 people.

In July 2015, she began consulting with various non-profit organizations across the country on ways to improve the ‘fun- factor’ at their charity events. The movement also promotes ways individuals can become FUN-lanthropists, by organizing FUN-raising events on behalf of their favorite charities.https://www.chideo.com/chideo/causewire-kim-coles- elisabeth-rohm-and-wendy-burch-dress-downtown-women-s-center-for-success Burch's philanthropic expertise comes from her years of giving back. In 2006, Burch founded The Good News Foundation, a non-profit organization that recognized and rewarded remarkable individuals and organizations making ‘good news’ in Greater Los Angeles. Under Burch's direction and vision, the foundation grew into one of Los Angeles’ premier charities. She spearheaded the philanthropic efforts from 2006 to 2014 and, during that time, The Good News Foundation gave away more than 1.5 million dollars in grants, gifts and in-kind donations. Additionally, Burch is an outspoken advocate for women struggling with fertility issues. She publicly chronicled her own pregnancy journey after the age of 40, and candidly discussed her decision to use a donor egg to ensure a successful pregnancy at the age of 46. Burch is an advocate for egg freezing and her voice has been instrumental in encouraging other women to seek out fertility treatments and alternatives.http://www.schoolonwheels.org/pdfs/3117/goodnewsComputer%2520Center%2520News%2520Release.pdf  Personal life  Burch was in relationships with Charlie Monfort, owner of the Colorado Rockies major league baseball team, as well as Joe Maloof, President of Maloof Companies and owner of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada. She was briefly engaged to Bruce Taylor, who is the biological father to her son Brady. The couple ended their relationship shortly after Burch became pregnant.

The murders have received significant media coverage because a photo and audio recording of an individual believed to be the girls' killer was found on German's smartphone. Despite thousands of tips that have been sent to the police and the circulation of the recordings of the suspect, no arrest in the case has been made.  Murders  At 1:35 p.m. on February 13, 2017, 13-year-old Abigail J. \\"Abby\\" Williams and 14-year-old Liberty Rose Lynn \\"Libby\\" German were dropped off by German's older sister, Kelsi German, at a trail-head on County Road 300 North, west of the Hoosier Heartland Highway. The girls were hiking on the Monon High Bridge over Deer Creek, among woodland in remote Deer Creek Township. At 2:07 p.m., Libby posted a photo of Abby walking the bridge; after this they weren’t heard from again. They were reported missing at 5:30 p.m. after they failed to meet Liberty’s father at 3:15 p.m. The families initially searched for the girls themselves before calling the police. Authorities who quickly searched the area did not initially suspect foul play in the disappearance. However, this changed when the bodies of the girls were found around noon the next day, about east of the abandoned Monon High Bridge. The bodies were about from the north bank of Deer Creek.  Investigation  Distributed photograph of suspect Updated sketch of suspect Police have not publicly stated nor released details of how the girls were murdered. As early as February 15, 2017, Indiana State Police began circulating a still image of an individual reportedly seen on the Monon High Bridge Trail near where the two friends were slain; the grainy photograph appears to capture a Caucasian male, hands in pockets, walking on the rail bridge, head down, toward the girls. A few days later, the person in the photograph was named the prime suspect in the double-homicide. On February 22, law enforcement released an audio recording where the voice of the assailant, though in some degree muffled, is heard to say, \\"Down the hill.\\" It was at this news conference that officials credited the source of the audio and imagery to German's smartphone, and, further, regarded her as a hero for having had the uncanny foresight and fortitude to record the exchange in secret. Police indicated that additional evidence from the phone had been secured, but that they did not release it so as not to \\"compromise any future trial.\\" By this time, the reward offered in the case was set at $41,000. On July 17, officers distributed a composite sketch of someone who, at that time in the investigation, was sought as a person of prime interest in the murders. It had apparently been drawn by police from eyewitnesses to a certain hiker of the Delphi Historic Trails on the day that the girls vanished. On April 19, 2019, Indiana State Police announced a \\"new direction\\" in the case. On behalf of State Police and the Multi-Agency Taskforce, Superintendent Doug Carter released more materials a few days later in a press conference held on April 22. The new materials included a short video recording in which the blue-jeaned and jacketed suspect is seen walking along the rail bridge for a little over a second. Supt. Carter states that because of the deteriorated condition of the bridge, the suspect is not walking naturally due to the spacing between the ties. An updated sketch of the suspect was also unveiled, as well as an extended version of the audio recording, in which a slight rise in the suspect's voice can be detected as he utters the word \\"Guys...\\", before the phrase \\"Down the hill.\\" It was further explained that the previously-released sketch, showing an older man with goatee and cap, is now considered secondary; by contrast, the clean- shaven individual of the newly revised composite is the primary sketch of the prime suspect. Police say this person may range from age 18 to 40, but caution that his \\"youthful appearance\\" could make him look younger than his true age. On April 22, law enforcement reached out to the public urging all to look at the sketch, listen to the audio, watch how the man walks on the bridge and send tips to this email: Abbyandlibbytip@cacoshrf.com. Investigators revealed they have reason to believe that the suspect might well be hiding in plain sight, and that the person is almost certainly familiar with the area of Delphi, whether it be from living or working there or for another reason. An additional plea was made for help in identifying the driver of a vehicle left abandoned off the Hoosier Heartland Highway in Delphi, at the former Child Services office, between noon and 5 p.m. on the day of the murders.  Persons of interest  = Paul Etter = On July 23, 2019, after receiving a tip, authorities announced that Paul Etter was being considered a person of interest in the murders. Etter was wanted for the kidnapping and rape of a 26-year-old woman on June 22 in Tippecanoe County. Five days later, Etter was surrounded by police, and after a five hour stand-off, he died by suicide. = Daniel J. Nations = Daniel J. Nations, a registered sex offender from Indiana, was arrested in Woodland Park, Colorado in September 2017 and charged with threatening strangers on a Monument trail with a hatchet. The expired Indiana plates on the car Nations was driving was noticed by police, who subsequently discovered an outstanding warrant under his name. Fanning public speculation still further, it was reported that a bicyclist had been fatally shot on the same trail at around the time that Nations was purportedly terrifying passersby. An El Paso County sheriff's spokesman told reporters that, however \\"many similarities\\" there were between the cases, he was not at liberty to disclose them, since Indiana investigators did not want any more information released. On January 5, 2018, Nations was sentenced to three years of probation for threatening members of the public in Colorado; however, he was not released since he had an active warrant out on him back in Indiana. On January 24, Nations was finally transferred to Indiana officials' custody on an unrelated charge, failure to register as a sex offender. In early February 2018, authorities said that Nations was no longer considered an active person of interest in the Delphi murders. = Thomas Bruce = Thomas Bruce, who formerly worked as a pastor, is charged with fatally shooting one woman and sexually assaulting two others, after having ordered them at gunpoint into the back room of a suburban St. Louis shop for religious supplies. Committed in broad daylight on November 19, 2018, these crimes put Bruce in the spotlight of the press. Some noted his being of similar stature (5-foot-7 to 5-foot-9 inches) to the then-current suspect description in the Delphi slayings; also, his wearing a flat cap and navy-blue jacket during this attack, not unlike the suspect in the Delphi case. Indiana State Police did look into his possible connection in November. On December 4, Bruce was charged with no fewer than 17 felony counts related to the St. Louis case and could receive the death penalty. = Charles Eldridge = Charles Eldridge was arrested on January 8, 2019 in Union City, Indiana, on charges of child molestation and child solicitation. Police in Randolph County alerted the FBI to a potential link between Eldridge and the Delphi murders, on account of his strong resemblance to the suspect sketch, albeit this was before the updated composite had come out. Memorials In response to a request from German's mother, countless homeowners across central Indiana have had orange lights installed on their front porches, both to commemorate the girls as well as to indicate that the murderer remains at large. In August 2017, the families announced their plans to build a sports complex for Delphi in the memory of the girls. A non-profit organization, L & A Park Foundation, was formed to \\"celebrate and commemorate the lives of Libby German and Abby Williams by creating a place for the appreciation of nature, art, play, and athleticism for generations to come.\\" A site was procured a mile north of Delphi, and in the years following the girls' deaths continued progress has been made in the development of Abby and Libby Memorial Park.

It was first performed on Broadway by Christopher Jackson, in the role of George Washington, with Lin-Manuel Miranda as Alexander Hamilton.  Synopsis and sources  The song portrays George Washington's decision not to run for re- election as President, thereby introducing America to the practice of a peaceful and orderly transition between administrations. He asks Hamilton to write his final address to the American people, discussing his philosophy of governance and the importance of knowing \\"how to say goodbye\\", and discusses his desire to retire and live the rest of his life outside public scrutiny. The song's second half includes an excerpt from the actual historical text of Washington's farewell address; Hamilton reads the address, as Washington sings the same words to a melody. In addition to the Farewell Address, the song also quotes a verse of the Bible: \\"Everyone shall sit under their own vine and fig tree, and no one shall make them afraid\\" (Micah 4:4, 1 Kings 4:25 and 2 Kings 18:31). The historical Washington was fond of quoting this line in his correspondence. The segment in which Washington sings along as Hamilton reads the text of the Farewell Address was inspired by will.i.am's song \\"Yes We Can\\", in which performers sing along to a speech by Barack Obama. In December 2018, Miranda released a remix version of the song featuring Obama as a guest performer reciting the extracts of the farewell speech. A fragment of this song is reprised in Hamilton's soliloquy in The World Was Wide Enough.  Live performances  The cast of Hamilton performed this song for the Obama White House as they neared the end of their eight-year tenure, which would be transitioned to the Trump era. Obama led the room in a standing ovation. Hamilton cast member Bryan Terrell Clark said \\"There's no way that any actor on that stage can say the words that we're saying and ignore the political climate that we're immersed in right now.\\" Mashable explains the point of the song: \\"No matter how many people chant \\"Four more years!\\"—he believes his duty is to be a citizen and exit gracefully.\\"  Style  The song has a \\"resonant gospel sound\\". Different interpretations of the song have ranged from \\"forceful Gospel preacher\\" to \\"smooth R&B; crooner\\".  Critical reception  Vibe asserted that Washington \\"sings his heart out\\". The Huffington Post thought that the drum beats in this song had a \\"Garageband-y\\" character, which contrasted with Jackson's impressive vocals.

Many of these storms affected the Philippines, China, and Japan, collectively leaving 15,952 fatalities. The strongest storm of the year also had the lowest barometric pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone worldwide at the time. On August 18, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a barometric pressure of 886.7 millibar (26.185 inches of mercury) about 740 kilometres (460 miles) east of Luzon. This typhoon later struck near Hong Kong, where it halted transportation, wrecked buildings, and killed 15 people. The first storm of the year originated near the Caroline Islands on February 12, which capsized the freighter Elkton and caused the loss of its crew of 36 people. Storms were observed in each subsequent month of the year. In May, a typhoon wrecked the passenger ferry SS Negros near the Philippine province of Romblon, killing 108 people. A typhoon in July killed around 10,000 people in China, mostly related to mountain flooding near Zhangzhou, leaving around 100,000 people homeless. A month later, another landfalling typhoon in China killed about 5,000 people and damaged nearly 20,000 houses. In September, an intense typhoon moved through Japan around the same time that an undersea earthquake affected the region; the concurrent disasters killed about 600 people, after a 3 metre (10 foot) tsunami washed away boats and houses along the coast. Another Chinese typhoon in September killed 5,000 people. The final storm of the year dissipated on December 19 to the west of the Philippines. __TOC__ Season summary The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) tracked 21 tropical systems during the year, then referred as \\"depressions\\". Of these storms, 19 were estimated to have attained typhoon status, which has maximum sustained winds of at least 119 km/h (74 mph). The HKO distributed storm warnings to 86 weather stations or officials, including by telephone for the first time. During the year, 11 tropical cyclones passed near the Philippines, of which seven crossed land; four of these were typhoons. The fewer than average storms in the archipelago resulted in lower than average rainfall in western Luzon. The Philippines government insurance fund claimed ₱16,149.25 in damages, mostly related to a radio station that was destroyed in Baler.  Systems  =February-June= The first tropical cyclone observed in 1927 was noted on February 12 southeast of Yap in the Caroline Islands. It moved west-northwestward, passing near Ngulu Atoll on February 14\\\\. The storm was last observed on February 16 after recurving to the northeast. Yap recorded a barometric pressure of 986 mbar (29.11 inHg), suggesting that the storm was a typhoon. On February 15, the freighter Elkton sent a distress signal amid the storm about 870 km (540 mi) northwest of Guam. By the time the S.S. Liberator arrived the next day, it only observed a oil patch; this suggested that the ship, its crew of 36 people, and the $1 million worth of sugar aboard, had capsized. The United States Navy deployed four destroyers from Manila, but was unable to find the wreckage. A short-lived tropical cyclone was first observed on March 19, east of Mindanao in the Philippines. The system progressed northwestward through the Eastern Visayas, dissipating on March 20 over Masbate. On April 1, a tropical storm formed southwest of Taiwan, and progressed northeastward, passing between the island and the northern Philippines; the storm was last noted on April 4 south of Japan. As early as May 22, a tropical cyclone existed east of the Philippine island of Samar. Tracking west-northwestward, the storm was at typhoon intensity when it struck eastern Luzon on May 26 near Baler, where a pressure of 994 mbar (29.35 inHg) was recorded. The center became disrupted while traversing the island, emerging into the South China Sea near Dagupan. It slowed to a northwest drift, dissipating on June 1 southeast of China. On May 28, the passenger ferry SS Negros foundered near Romblon during the typhoon, with the loss of 108 of the 178 people on board. Another storm appeared east of the Philippines on May 26, located south of Yap. Initially, the system moved west-northwestward, passing over Palau, where 80% of houses were destroyed; damage was estimated at ¥400,000. The storm turned to the north-northwest, then later curved back to the west-northwest, reaching the Balintang Channel north of Luzon on June 2\\\\. That day, the town of Basco, Batanes in the waterway recorded a pressure of 973 mbar (28.73 inHg). On June 3, the storm crossed over Taiwan and recurved to the northeast. It was last noted on June 6 just south of the Japanese island of Kyushu. =July= A tropical cyclone was first noted on July 11 east of Luzon. It moved generally to the west-northwest for a few days before curving to the northwest. On July 15, the steamer Tjikandi encountered the typhoon, estimating winds of 160 km/h (100 mph); two quartermasters were washed overboard, and the railing and hatches were wrecked. On July 17, the typhoon struck southeastern Taiwan and moved across the southern portion of the island, where Hengchun recorded a barometric pressure of 978 mbar (28.89 inHg). Crossing the Taiwan Strait, the storm entered southeastern China near Xiamen on July 17, and dissipated the next day. On July 20, a tropical cyclone developed east of Luzon and proceeded to the west-northwest. Three days later, the storm struck Isabela province in eastern Luzon. It moved northwestward once in the South China Sea, passing near the Pratas Islands. On July 25, the SS President Madison encountered the storm near the coast of China, reporting hurricane force winds and a minimum pressure of 975 mbar (28.80 inHg). That day, the typhoon moved ashore near Hong Kong, where winds reached . Also near Hong Kong, a Chinese junk sank, killing 191 people, while passengers were rescued by the steamer Wing On. The storm curved to the southwest over land, dissipating on July 27. Flooding along the Jiulong River killed 10,000 people by drowning, mostly in mountainous areas near Zhangzhou. The floods left another 100,000 people homeless, and caused $2 million in damages. =August= The August issue of the Monthly Weather Review journal noted a small typhoon west of the Ryukyu Islands from August 2-4, moving northward and \\"of no great importance.\\" A tropical cyclone was first reported on August 6 east of Luzon and north of Yap. It moved to the northwest, turned northeastward, and curved back to the northwest through the southern Ryukyu Islands. As it approached the eastern coast of China, the typhoon turned more to the north, and later crossed the Korean peninsula; it was last reported on August 10 off the east coast of the peninsula. Another storm originated north of Yap on August 11, and moved generally to the northwest. On August 16, the typhoon struck southeastern Taiwan and crossed the island. The storm proceeded westward, crossed the Taiwan Strait, and moved ashore southeastern China, dissipating on August 17. On August 13, a tropical cyclone was observed south of Guam. It moved west-northwestward and attained a great intensity. On August 18, the Dutch steamship Sapoeroea recorded a barometric pressure of 886.7 mbar (26.185 inHg) about 740 km (460 mi) east of Luzon. This was the lowest pressure recorded in a tropical cyclone at the time, until a Hurricane hunters plane released a dropsonde into Typhoon Ida in 1958 and recorded a pressure of 877 mbar (25.91 inHg). Early on August 19, the typhoon passed near Aparri in northern Luzon, which recorded a pressure of 969 mbar (28.60 inHg). The storm's strong winds affected Cagayan, Mountain, Ilocos Norte, and Ilocos Sur provinces. Progressing into the South China Sea, the typhoon approached within 16 km (10 mi) of the Pratas Islands on August 20, where Force 11 winds were recorded. Later that day, the storm passed about 95 km (60 mi) south of Hong Kong, where wind gusts reached . In Cheung Sha Wan, the typhoon wrecked 120 buildings, and the entire shanty town in Kowloon Tong was ruined. Ferry and tram service was halted, and a bus was overturned on Salisbury Road. Throughout Hong Kong, 11 boats were wrecked, 15 people were killed, and another 22 others were injured. Continuing across southern China, the storm was last observed on August 22. As early as August 19, a tropical cyclone was near and south of Guam. Its track curved from the west-northwest to the north, drifting at times west of the Marianas Islands. The typhoon turned to the northwest, and was nearing the Ryukyu Islands on August 27\\\\. Turning westward and later to the west-southwest, the storm moved across Taiwan moved into the South China Sea. The typhoon moved ashore southern China in Guangdong on or after August 30 to the west of Hong Kong. In the province, the typhoon and its accompanying waves killed 5,000 people.

The storm was last noted on September 2 to the east of Japan. =September= A typhoon was first observed on September 9 northeast of the Philippines. Passing Guam two days later, its northward track shifted to the northeast toward Japan. The typhoon struck Kyushu on September 13, described in the Monthly Weather Review as the \\"most severe felt there in recent years.\\" Around the same time, an underwater earthquake affected the region, which produced a tsunami that washed away buildings along the coast and carried boats two miles inland. Newspapers reported nearly 600 fatalities during the typhoon and earthquake. River flooding in Ōmura inundated 5,000 houses, leaving 15,000 people homeless. The storm ruined rice fields, causing prices to increase. Across Kyushu, the typhoon flooded or wrecked the roofs of thousands of homes. The typhoon moved through southern Japan and was last noted on September 15 nearing the Kuril Islands. A typhoon approached eastern Luzon on September 16, and moved across the island on the next day. In the municipality of Baler on the east coast, a minimum pressure of 969 mbar (28.63 inHg) was recorded. The typhoon's eye passed over and nearly destroyed the town. A tornado spawned by the typhoon hit Metro Manila. The typhoon progressed westward into the South China Sea, later curving to the northwest and entering the Gulf of Tonkin near the island of Hainan. After the storm, the Philippine government provided aid to residents. On September 20, a tropical cyclone was observed south off Guam, which proceeded northward through the Northern Marianas Islands. It turned to the northwest, but curved to the northeast by September 22\\\\. Passing south of Japan, the storm was last observed two days later. Another storm was observed on September 23 to the south of the Ryukyu Islands. It moved to the northeast at first before executing a loop in its track, passing through the Ryukyu Islands. The storm progressed to the northeast, remaining south of Japan, and was last noted on September 29. The final storm of the month was first observed on September 29 near Guam. Moving generally to the northwest at first, it turned to the northeast on September 30 and was last observed two days later to the southeast of Japan. While near the Bonin Islands, a station recorded a minimum pressure of 989 mbar (29.23 inHg). On September 26, a typhoon struck China, killing about 5,000 people.https://www.adrc.asia/publications/databook/ORG/databook_20th/CHN.pdf =October-December= A typhoon was first observed southwest of Guam on October 1, which progressed steadily westward. On October 4, the storm crossed the Philippines, entering from Borongan in Eastern Samar to Capiz and into the South China Sea. Heavy damage occurred along the path, and several boats were wrecked in Capiz, resulting in several fatalities. The island of Mindoro lost communications with Manila during the storm. Shifting to the west-northwest, the storm moved ashore eastern Vietnam on October 8 near Danang. Another typhoon followed a similar path, originating near Guam on October 4 and progressing westward. Five days later, the storm struck the Philippine province of Camarines Norte, causing damage as it moved westward through Luzon. Moving across the South China Sea, the storm struck the east coast of what was then Indochina on October 11. A typhoon was observed on October 13 east of Guam, which moved generally northwestward for three days; then, it recurved to the northeast, and was last reported on October 18. Another typhoon originated southeast of Guam on October 19\\\\. It moved generally westward toward the Philippines before curving more to the north on October 24\\\\. The track shifted to the northeast, and the typhoon passed between Japan and the Bonin Islands. It was last observed on October 30. On November 17, a typhoon originated west of Guam, which moved slowly to the west or west- northwest. It approached the eastern Philippines but remained east of the island group. On November 22, the typhoon curved to the northeast, remaining south of Japan. Another storm appeared on November 22 to the northwest of the previous storm, just to the northeast of Samar. It moved northwestward at first, but recurved to the northeast away from Luzon, and was last reported on November 24. On that same day, a typhoon was observed southeast of Guam and proceeded westward. The storm passed near Yap on November 25 and later turned to the north. Two days later, a passing United States Navy ship encountered the storm. On November 29, a storm passed near the Bonin Islands, but it was uncertain whether it was the first typhoon of the month near the Philippines or the storm that affected Yap. This storm was last observed on November 30. A storm appeared west of Yap on December 3\\\\. Moving to the west-northwest, it crossed through the Visayas and Mindoro islands in the central Philippines.

Sex or the possibility of sex can function as a distraction, incentive, cover story, or unintended part of any intelligence operation. Sexpionage is a historically documented phenomenon and even the CIA has previously added Nigel West's work Historical Dictionary of Sexspionage to its proposed intelligence officer's bookshelf. A commonly known type of sexpionage is a honey trap operation, which is designed to compromise an opponent sexually to elicit information from that person. In the KGB, a man who is the seducer in a honey trap operation is known as a raven (Вороны). A female seductress is known as a swallow (ласточка). The raven effectively functions as an undercover pimp while the swallow functions as an undercover prostitute. A \\"swallow's nest\\" was the name given for the double-apartments in which the target would be seduced in one room while next door KGB technicians filmed or taped the entire affair.  Homosexual entrapment with the NSA  Discrimination and cultural attitudes toward homosexuals have pressured them into spying or not spying for a certain entity, sometimes with drastic consequences. For example, Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, former director of the NSA, decided to not fire openly gay employees in exchange for each employee's written promise not to give in to blackmail and that each gay employee would inform his family, eliminating any further potential for blackmail. This was a serious issue, as two NSA analysts defected to Moscow in 1960 following a purge of homosexuals from the agency.  Soviet and Russian sexpionage  Yakov Agranov, deputy of NKVD, known as one of main organizers of Soviet political repressions and Stalinist show trials in 1920s and 1930s, was responsible for sex spy operations among creative intelligentsia. He used Bolshoi ballerinas, as well as cinema and theater actresses. Agranov created a school named the Lenin Technical School (Ленинская техническая школа). The school was opened in 1931 by Vyacheslav Menzhinsky, who was the head of the Joint State Political Directorate. According to legend, Richard Sorge and Nikolai Kuznetsov studied at a Moscow Sexpionage school.Love under the hood, the \\"Swallows\\" flew.Sex for the motherland (Секс за родину).

Russian 'spy': a 'swallow' came to spy on us, The Telegraph. The Washington Post reported in 1987 that \\"Most westerners who have spent any length of time in Moscow have their favorite tale of an attempted seduction by a KGB swallow or raven.\\" East German spies Spies for East Germany were called \\"Romeos\\" created by Markus Wolf, the former head of East Germany's foreign intelligence service the Stasi. Around 40 women were prosecuted for espionage in the Federal Republic of Germany.Linda Pressly, The spy who loved her, The Guardian, 18 November 2004. Notable individuals and events = Kursk Nightingale – Russia = Nadezhda Plevitskaya, a former opera singer known as the \\"Kursk Nightingale\\" before the Russian Civil War, found herself living without her former luxuries following the Bolshevik Revolution. The Cheka recruited Plevitskaya through her lust for money. \\"Traveling throughout the white-held areas, she entertained the troops at free concerts, at the same time ingratiating herself with anti-Bolshevik leaders who had long admired the 'Kursk Nightingale.' In the process, she began to collect interesting intelligence tidbits from some of the more indiscreet Whites (including those she slept with to pry even more information).\\" However, Plevitskaya was captured by the Whites after intercepting some of her messages to the Cheka and ordered to be executed by firing squad. Nikolai Skoblin, then a young White cavalry officer and a megalomaniac obsessed with the idea of recreating the \\"Holy Russia,\\" a mythical land that existed before the time of the Tsars, saw Plevitskaya refuse a blindfold before her execution. Motivated by her beauty and courage, Skoblin rode up, ordered the firing squad not to fire, and released her in his custody. Then the Cheka used Plevitskaya to recruit Skoblin, and both got married (with Vassileivna's then- husband understandingly serving as Best Man in the wedding) and moved to Paris, working for the Cheka among the Russian Exile Movement. = Cynthia – Britain = Amy Thorpe Pack was an American who married a senior British diplomat and began extramarital affairs upon finding her marriage passionless. She volunteered her services to MI6 while living with her husband in Warsaw in 1937. In Warsaw, she seduced a Polish Foreign Ministry Official eliciting from him Poland's plans regarding how to deal with Hitler and Stalin. Following this, she learned from another Polish official that some Polish Mathematicians had started cracking the German Enigma Ciphers. Later, in Czechoslovakia, she discovered the German plans to invade Czechoslovakia. After a colorless stint of boredom at a posting in Santiago, Chile, Pack separated from her husband and went to New York City in 1941, when William Stephenson, then an MI6 Chief of Station, contacted her and asked her to infiltrate embassies in Washington, D.C. Realizing her motivation was a lust for danger and excitement, Stephenson gave her the code name Cynthia, after a long-lost love. Pack then seduced the chief of station for Italian military intelligence and acquired the Italian navy cipher. Beginning in early 1942, Pack posed as a pro-Vichy journalist and got Charles Brousse, the Vichy French embassy's press attaché and a Vichy politician, to fall in love with her and agree to work as an OSS asset. In a near six-hour night burglary operation, Pack and Brousse let an OSS safecracker into the embassy to carry away the Vichy code books for photographing, and at one point Pack undressed to cover for the operation by deceiving a suspicious night guard. After the operation for the Vichy codes, Pack retired from espionage because she fell in love with Brousse. = Commander Courtney Affair – Soviet Union = Commander Anthony Courtney was a \\"tough and opinionated former naval officer and Member of Parliament who denounced the government of the day and the Foreign Office for softness in permitting Soviet and Iron Curtain diplomats to abuse their privileges for espionage purposes.\\" The Commander spoke fluent Russian and in 1961 he went to bed with his Intourist guide, Zinaida Grigorievna Volkova, who was in fact a regular KGB seductress, and KGB photographers captured it. The KGB tried to blackmail Courtney into ending his Parliamentary tirades, though he refused, and they circulated the pictures to other members of parliament and business associates. Furthermore, Private Eye, a London satirical journal, obtained the photos and published them. Courtney lost his seat in the following election. = Ambassador Dejean Affair – Soviet Union = Maurice Dejean, the former French ambassador to the Soviet Union, was an old friend with close connections to President De Gaulle, and he had a fondness for women. The KGB took advantage of this and set up Dejean first with Lydia Khovanskaya, a divorcee who spoke French, and later Larisa Kronberg-Sobolevskaya, an actress. While Dejean was with Larisa, her pretend husband returned home, as staged, from a geological expedition in Siberia, and beat Dejean, but allowed him to leave upon Larisa's pleading. Dejean went to a Soviet friend, who unbeknownst to him worked for the KGB, to quiet the affair. The Soviets took no immediate action, but preferred to hold their operation as leverage just in case to keep the French ambassador within their sway. Similar KGB honey traps on Dejean's wife, Marie-Claire, were unsuccessful. President De Gaulle and the French found out about the affair from British intelligence, who in turn learned of it from Yuri Krotkov, a defector. Krotkov defected in 1963 after a French Air Force attaché, Colonel Louis Guibard, shot himself when the KGB showed him pictures they took of his affair with a Russian woman and presented him with the choice of either exposure or collaboration. = Sir Geoffrey and Galya – Soviet Union = Sir Geoffrey Harrison, British Ambassador to Moscow, was the target of a KGB blackmail attempt in 1968, when they placed an attractive maid named Galya in the diplomatic mission. Sir Geoffrey fell for the honey trap, and Galya told him that pictures had been taken and that he would be exposed unless he provided information to the KGB. The scandal broke, but Sir Geoffrey had no action taken against him and he retired on full pension. = KGB break- in at Swedish Embassy in Moscow – Soviet Union = Yuri Nosenko, a Soviet defector to the West, detailed the use of a honey trap when the KGB launched a night operation to raid the Swedish Embassy in Moscow with a twelve-strong crew of safe-pickers and break-in experts. According to Nosenko, a female KGB seductress lured away the embassy's night watchman and another agent distracted a guard dog by feeding it meat. = Donald Maclean – Soviet Union = Donald Duart Maclean was a British diplomat who spied for the Soviet Union mostly out of love for it, and he never received pay, although did get a KGB pension. However, to make sure that Maclean would not so easily double-cross the Soviets, they had Guy Burgess, another British homosexual spying for the Soviets, take photos of Maclean in bed with another man during an orgy. = William Vassall – Soviet Union = William John Vassall was an openly gay man who boasted that men said he had \\"come to bed eyes,\\" and in 1954, as a clerk in the office of the British naval attaché, Vassall went to Moscow. A Polish clerk from the embassy brought Vassall to a party with much alcohol, and he became involved in homosexual activity. Soon, Vassall had been blackmailed and was stealing classified information for the Soviets. American use of sexpionage The Former Assistant FBI Director William C. Sullivan in testimony before the Church Committee on 1 November 1975 stated: \\"The use of sex is a common practice among intelligence services all over the world. This is a tough dirty business. We have used that technique against the Soviets. They have used it against us.\\"Nigel West, The A to Z of Sexpionage. Aleksandr Ogorodnik, Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs' planning department was Codenamed TRIGON by the Central Intelligence Agency dated a Spanish woman who was recruited by the CIA. In 1973 she persuaded him to supply the CIA with information.  Spies mistaken as ravens  A male spy with a promiscuous lifestyle is not necessarily a professional raven. For example, Duško Popov was a double agent working for MI5 and feeding information to the Abwehr in World War II. He came from a moderately wealthy Yugoslavian family, and had a taste for expensive restaurants, women, and nightclubs. MI5 code-named him TRICYCLE for his habit of taking two women to bed at the same time. Despite being seen as an inspiration for James Bond, Popov was never a raven, but instead used supposed commercial connections to feed faked intelligence to the Nazis.  Agent falling for their mission partner  One instance of sex or intimacy which can happen during espionage is when an agent falls for his or her partner. In one example, an Israeli \\"champagne spy,\\" Wolfgang Lotz, who pretended to be a former Afrika Corps vet, covered himself deep in German social circles in Egypt prior to the Six-Day War, and fell in love with his fake \\"German\\" wife, who converted to Judaism. Lotz divorced his real wife, who was Israeli, for his partner.  Sexpionage in popular culture  James Bond is a fictional character depicted as a raven; his parodical counterpart Austin Powers also uses sexpionage to elicit information. A 1987 espionage-themed American pornographic film featuring Dana Dylan, Rachel Ashley, and Britt Morgan was titled \\"Sexpionage.\\" In the 2014 film The Interview, use of a swallow is somewhat colloquially referred to as \\"honeypotting,\\" and use of a raven is referred to as \\"honeydicking.\\" The 2018 film Red Sparrow shows a modern version of sexpionage.

According to the degree of participation of the different groups, the company can take advantage of market imperfections to create valuable opportunities. It emphasizes active management of the business environment, relationships and the promotion of shared interests. This approach is based on stakeholder theory, which arises as a counterpart to business practices and management that focus on shareholders satisfaction. The implementation of this approach can reinforce the firm values and create competitive advantage. However, it has been criticized for overvaluing stakeholders and its difficulty to reach consensus. Stakeholder management process  Utility  = Competitive advantage = This approach may create competitive advantage because it links the firm and stakeholders. The latter perceive the coherent application of the organizational values and relate to those. In that way, the company has the information about stakeholders it needs to treat them well and develop important initiatives. This reinforces the firm’s reputation and loyalty among customers and other stakeholders, creates stronger brand recognition and increases trust in the firm. Even if there are limits in loyalty and reputation can be damaged, those two key elements can make a big difference creating barriers to other companies that may want to have information about stakeholder utility functions. Proponents maintain that a firm that follows the stakeholder approach gets the information it needs to satisfy the stakeholders’ needs, making it easier to develop expertise. Those acquired skills can be transmitted, promoted and reinforced across the business operation of the firm creating core competencies. Over time, this approach can become an indispensable issue in the organizational culture. = Value creating through innovation = Firms that manage for stakeholders are more able to attract a higher-quality workforce. Employees’ job satisfaction has an impact on the firm’s ability to foster innovation. Workers who are satisfied with their jobs are more likely to engage in long-term thinking and generate potentially valuable ideas. Those firms can use information about stakeholder to devise new ways of satisfying them. Reciprocity is a key aspect in this approach: when stakeholders stand to benefit, they are more likely to reveal information about their utility function. That is why firms and firm managers can better meet consumers' needs by understanding their own customers and suppliers and using this information strategically and flexibly.  Limits  = Divergent interests = Trying to satisfy a large number of players complicates governance, and may make it difficult to reach consensus. The consideration of so many varying interests is likely to produce divergent opinions, while individual interests and self-motivated actors may warp decision-making outcomes. Moreover, this approach has been criticized for implying that all stakeholders negotiate on a level playing field, ignoring potential disparities between the various interested parties. = Overvaluing stakeholders = It has been suggested that obtaining information about stakeholders' utility functions may produce costs that can exceed the benefits. Therefore, in its intention to create value, managing for stakeholders can end up allocating too many resources to stakeholders. Further, taking into account that power among stakeholders is not evenly distributed, certain actors may be able to appropriate more of a firm’s profit for themselves than other interested parties. This warps the distribution of value between shareholders, rather than maximizing returns.  External links  * Negotiation power - Program on negotiation.

He was a member of the National Parliament of Papua New Guinea from 2012 to 2017, representing the electorate of Lagaip-Porgera Open. Mangape was a Porgera landowner and the chairman of the Porgera Development Authority before entering politics. Under his chairmanship, the authority provided roads, schools, health centres, airstrips and sports facilities in the Porgera Valley. Prominent in discussions surrounding the Porgera Gold Mine, he demanded a review of the mine agreement and a Commission of Inquiry into the killing of more than 20 people within the Special Mining Lease, and repeatedly supported calls for a state of emergency and further police assistance in the area following law and order concerns. He was also the chairman of two landowner companies, Kupiane Yuu Anduane Company and Kupiane Investment Limited. In August 2010, Mangape was shot by Barrick Gold's private security guards, subsequently receiving treatment for pellet wounds to the back. Mangape was elected to the National Parliament as an independent at the 2012 election. He claimed upon his election that more than K100 million of project grants for his electorate had \\"gone missing\\" in the previous five years. He stated that his first priority was to create a five-year plan for the electorate, while raising the review of the mining agreement, outstanding commitments under its memorandum of understanding and law and order problems as major issues. He supported the introduction of the death penalty, claiming that the government's failure to do so was responsible for an increase in violent crime. In May 2013, he advocated ending \\"Fly-in fly-out\\" employment in favour of building \\"decent townships in mining areas\\". He raised concerns about severe environmental damage stemming from the mine on a number of occasions, calling for a state of emergency to rectify the damage. Mangape supported Barrick Gold's Restoring Justice Initiative, a partnership between business, government and community to address the area's law and order issues. Mangape supported the Mt Kare gold project in his electorate, calling for landowner groups to unite behind the project. In February 2014, he announced that alcohol would be banned in the district. He was a strong supporter of the Porgera-Tari road project, suggesting that was important for the area's economic life after the eventual close of the mine. In August 2014, he called for independent monitoring of toxic waste levels around the mine, and stated that \\"if the developer believes the waster levels are acceptable\\", they should \\"eat some fish from the river.\\" He stated that the developer \\"should bear the blame for the loss of lives and other diseases unknown to the people that lived in that isolated parts of the country that have lived happily with their environment for years before the mine.\\" In November 2014, Mangape crossed from the government to the opposition along with ally and dumped former Treasurer Don Polye. In February 2015, he called for Papua New Guinea's \\"royalty and equity\\" system of regulating resources to be replaced with a \\"production sharing contract\\", involving a 50-50 share between landowners and developers. In the same month, he was named Shadow Minister for Commerce and Trade, Pacific Games, Petroleum and Energy under opposition leader Polye. In October 2016, Mangape claimed that he had been offered and rejected a bribe of US$1.5 million to rejoin the government prior to a no-confidence vote that July.

History  The mine was situated about two miles east of the village of Cangai.\\"Cangai Copper Mine, Cangai, Gresham Co., New South Wales, Australia\\". mindat.org. Retrieved on 6 May 2017. The mine plant included a smelter and a narrow gauge locomotive-hauled tramway for transporting the firewood needed to fuel it. The mine paid rich dividends because of quality of the ore and other economies in production, including that the ore was self-fluxing and it could easily be transported downhill to the smelters. The company was set up by a group of Grafton businessmen, who were able to exercise local control over operations, unlike many other Australian mining ventures. Blister copper was transported to Copmanhurst wharf on the Clarence River by horse team. As timbered areas close to the mine were cut out, difficulties in transporting sufficient firewood for the smelters led to the construction of a 4-mile (6.4 kilometre) gauge tramway in 1910/11. The Australian Metal Company supplied rails and rolling stock imported from Germany, including a locomotive built in Berlin by Orenstein & Koppel. Wartime difficulties led to the copper smelter ceasing production before the end of 1916, and the mine was exhausted by the end of 1917.Shoebridge, J.W., The Cangai Railway: Grafton Copper Company Firewood Tramway, in Light Railways 134, October 1996.

Special Ops disbanded, taking a four year hiatus after releasing their live album Live and Kicking (to let their fans know they will be back) before returning in 2016 with their EP Tangents.

His favorite technique is drypoint and engraving and his preferred material is the industrial zinc plate. Kudryashov does no preparatory studies prior to drawing directly on the plate using a large burin or engraving needle. For his larger prints he lays the sheet of zinc directly on the floor and works from all sides. For colored prints, paint is applied to the paper before being run through the press with the inked zinc plate.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TBraRuSBcOM Later Three-Dimensional Works In 1978 Kudryashov systematically began to produce three dimensional reliefs from his drypoint prints. For these pieces, the image is run twice through the press and one of the images is cut into various geometrical shapes. Then, the cut-up geometrical shapes are slotted one into another and the resultant three-dimensional construct is attached to the initial print.https://www.kreegermuseum.org/images/21498_KK%20Catalog_Txt.pdf These art works blur the boundary between printing, painting, and sculpture.

It has since been implemented in shader libraries, software, and games released by Autodesk, NVIDIA, and Valve. Process Gooch shading defines an additional two colors in conjunction with the original model color: a warm color (such as yellow) and a cool color (such as blue). The warm color indicates surfaces that are facing toward the light source while the cool color indicates surfaces facing away. This allows shading to occur only in mid-tones so that edge lines and highlights remain visually prominent. The Gooch shader is typically implemented in two passes: all objects in the scene are first drawn with the \\"cool to warm\\" shading, and in the second pass the object’s edges are rendered in black.

The film follows a young girl who is possessed by the spirit of her deceased aunt. A co-production between Canada and France, it was shot on location in Westmount and Montreal, Quebec. Though the film was critically panned upon initial release, with many deriding it as being overly derivative of other films of the period including The Exorcist and Carrie, it has since become a cult classic, some calling the film \\"so bad it's good\\". Plot In 1947, Robert Gimble flees with his young daughter, Laura, enraged to find that his wife has left with their son, George. Robert crashes their car into a snowbank, and he and Laura are burned alive in the car. Thirty years later, George returns to his family home with his wife, Vivian, who is suffering from depression following a miscarriage, as well as the couple's eight-year-old daughter, Cathy. While exploring the home, Cathy uncovers an old doll along with a portrait of her aunt Mary in the attic. Meanwhile, Vivian becomes acquainted with the local neighbors, one of whom is a psychic medium who has a vision of Mary and her father's death while inside the home. Cathy's behavior soon begins to change rapidly: She is cruel to the other neighborhood children, and exhibits destructive telekinetic powers. While home alone with Cathy, Mary, her nanny and housekeeper, dies after falling from a window. Cathy's violent and abusive behavior continues to alienate those around her, particularly her mother, who sinks deeper into a major depressive state. The psychic later visits the home, and finds Cathy in the attic. The psychic is confronted by a disturbing vision of herself, disfigured and burned. Later, Cathy tries to commit suicide by drowning herself in a river, but is saved by George. George dismisses Vivian's fears that Cathy may be possessed or under the influence of supernatural forces connected to their house, dismissing the notions as delusions.

In 1983 it was designated as a monument historique in its entirety. Designed in the Neo-Gothic style by Louis-Auguste Boileau and Louis-Adrien Lusson, the church was the first in France to use an entirely iron-framed construction. The first stone was laid in 1854, and the building was completed in 1855.Ministère de la Culture et de la Communication.

History The parish of Saint-Eugène was created in 1854 to serve the growing population of the Faubourg Poissonnière district, at the time considered a suburb of Paris. The parish was entrusted to Abbé Coquand. The abbé helped finance the construction of the parish church on a piece of land which he owned. He specified that the style should reflect that of the 13th century, a time in the history of Christianity idealised by the 19th-century French Romantic movement. In order to minimize the cost of construction and maximize the interior space on the relatively small site, the abbé also suggested an iron-framed construction, which had hitherto only been used for industrial buildings.Mairie de Paris. \\"Les Balades du patrimoine: Les Églises du Second Empire De Saint-Eugène (9e) à Saint Augustin (8e)\\". Archived version of 1 August 2013 retrieved 7 May 2017 . Louis-Adrien Lusson had been originally commissioned to design the building. It was subsequently entrusted to Louis-Auguste Boileau, although Lusson remained involved in the design of its interior. Boileau had previously written a treatise on monumental architecture in which he championed the use of iron construction. The church was completed in 20 months. The first stone was laid in June 1854 and the building was inaugurated at Christmas 1855. It was dedicated to in honour of Empress Eugènie (the wife of Napoleon III) who was present at the inauguration. The church's design and iron construction provoked a controversy which was played out on the pages of the Journal des Debats in 1856 with Viollet-le-Duc accusing Boileau of being a mechanic rather than an architect and describing the church's Neo-Gothic design as a \\"pastiche of bad taste\\".Andia, Béatrice de (2001). Larousse Paris. p. 230. Distribooks International.

The main windows are largely the work of Louis-Adrien Lusson and . Eugène- Stanislas Oudinot created the church's set of Stations of the Cross which is the only known example realized entirely in stained glass.

With its realistic setting and characters, it represents something of a bridge between her early burlesques and the soberer novels that made her name.M. Girouard, Enthusiasms (2011) Chap I Date Appearing in Volume the Third of Austen's early writing (begun in 1792), Catharine is itself generally dated to 1792–3.E. Copeland ed., The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (1997) p. 85 However, a (substituted) reference to the Regency has been seen as linking it to the first regency crisis of 1788–9,E. Copeland ed., The Cambridge Companion to Jane Austen (1997) p. 85 rather than being a later interpolation; while alternatively, because of thematic parallels in Austen's letters of 1795–6, The Bower has also been post-dated to the mid-nineties instead.M. Girouard, Enthusiasms (2011) Ch. I Plot Summary Catharine (Kitty) Percival (the name is sometimes given as Peterson) is an orphan, ward of her aunt, Mrs. Percival, who is strict with her. Kitty has lost her dear friends, Cecilia and Mary Wynne, whose clergyman father's death scattered the family; Cecilia Wynne was sent to India to be married to a much older man she dislikes, and Mary is serving as a companion in the household of a distant relative, Lady Halifax, dependent on that family for even the clothes on her back. Together Kitty, Cecilia, and Mary had planted a bower in Mrs. Percival’s garden, which, now grown to maturity, is Kitty’s haven and chief comfort. Mrs. Percival goes to great lengths to prevent Kitty from meeting possibly unsuitable young men. Kitty is allowed to socialize only with Mr. and Mrs. Dudley and their daughter, an arrogant and quarrelsome family. Mrs. Percival even refuses visits from the Stanleys, relatives of Mrs. Percival and Catharine, who are a wealthy family with political and social influence, because they have a son, Edward, of marriageable age. However, Edward has now moved to France, and the Stanleys come to visit. Kitty excitedly anticipates their arrival. She is disappointed to find that their daughter, Camilla, has little in common with her. While Camilla's \\"ideas where towards the Eleagance of the appearance\\", she seemed to be \\"devoid of taste or judgment\\" (p. 169). Camilla \\"professed a love of books without reading, was lively without wit, and generally good humoured without merit\\" (p. 169). Kitty wants to discuss things like books and politics, but Camilla leads the conversation back to subjects Kitty views as frivolous, such as fashion and social life. Camilla is acquainted with the Halifaxes, and she and Kitty disagree over the Halifaxes and the Wynne sisters. Camilla thinks that the sisters are fortunate, while Kitty views their situation as tragic and thinks that the Wynnes have been ill-treated by their benefactors. Kitty concludes that she and Camilla will not come to an agreement, and escapes to her bower. Camilla later comes to the bower, excited, to tell Kitty that they have all been invited to the Dudleys’ ball the next evening. In the morning Kitty wakes up with a violent toothache that prevents her from attending the ball. Camilla, her parents, and Mrs. Percival decide to attend the ball without her. Mrs. Stanley and Mrs. Percival discuss the friendship between Camilla and Kitty. Mrs. Percival see their relationship as detrimental and tells Mrs. Stanley that she, herself, did not have such a companion. Mrs. Percival quips that perhaps it would have changed her for the better, and talks about the friend of her own girlhood, with whom she still keeps acquaintance. Edward Stanley turns up at the Percivals’ home, having returned to England unexpectedly, and convinces Kitty to go with him to the ball after all. Mrs. Percival is not pleased. In the following days Edward flirts with Kitty and it becomes apparent that he has much more in common with her than Camilla does. He makes a point of kissing her hand when Mrs. Percival is approaching and can witness it. Kitty begins to fall in love with Edward. Her aunt doesn't approve of him and chastises Kitty for scandalous behavior. Mr. Stanley is also displeased by Edward’s flirting with Kitty, and sends him back to the Continent. Kitty is hurt by his abrupt departure, but Camilla tells her that he was sorry to leave, obviously because he is in love with Kitty. Kitty is in a \\"state of satisfaction.\\" The book was never completed so we do not know where the story would have gone next.

It has rough, hard, fibrous bark on some or all of the trunk, lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds usually in groups of seven, pale yellow flowers and pendulous, urn-shaped fruit. Description The tree typically grows to a height of or shorter in mallee form with hard, scaly-fibrous, dark grey bark on the base of the tree which becomes a smooth white colour further up the tree. It forms a lignotuber and has glaucous branchlets. The concolorous, dull, blue-green to green adult leaves are arranged alternately. The leaf blade has a lanceolate shape with a length of and a width of with a that tapers to the petiole. It blooms between September and July producing cream-yellow flowers. Each unbranched axillary inflorescence usually has more than seven pedicellate buds. The mature buds have an ovoid to oblong shape with a length of and a width of . The buds are scarred with a beaked to horn shaped operculum and pale yellow flowers. After flowering, erect to pendulous fruits form that are mostly urn shaped with a length of and a width of . The fruits have a descending disc with three or four exserted valves. The brown-grey seeds within the fruit have an ovoid or flattened-ovoid shape. Taxonomy and naming Eucalyptus moderata was first formally described in 1991 by the botanists Lawrence Alexander Sidney Johnson and Ken Hill in the journal Telopea. The specific epithet is taken from the Latin word moderatus meaning \\"moderate\\" in reference to the medium sized habit and leaves, buds and fruit of the plant compared to its closest relatives. Distribution It is found on flats, slopes and road verges in the eastern Wheatbelt and the Goldfields-Esperance region growing in sandy-loamy soils over granite or laterite. The species is associated with the western mallee subgroup which is characterised by several eucalypts including E. oleosa, E. eremophila, E. incrassata, E. foecunda, E. redunca and E. uncinata. The understorey is predominantly shrubby with species of Melaleuca and Acacia along with the occasional Triodia.

Dr. Thomas Halliwell LL.D. M.A. (27 January 1900 – 1 December 1982) was the Principal of Trinity College Carmarthen (now the University of Wales Trinity St David) in the middle part of the 20th Century. Early life and education Thomas Halliwell was born in Wigan in 1900, the only child of John Halliwell, a noted Lancashire cricketer, and his wife Annie (née Carter) whose father was company secretary to Pearson and Knowles. Educated at Wigan Wesleyan Methodist School and Wigan Grammar School, Halliwell left school at age 15 to work in the Midland Bank. War service In 1918, and before his call-up, he had joined the merchant marine as a Marconi wireless operator aboard HMT Poleric (see RMS Albania). He described his experiences during World War I in his 1918 journal A Memorable Year, which is lodged in the Roderic Bowen Archive at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. Academic and clerical career Following service in the merchant marine during WWI, and after a period of voluntary teaching, he entered Manchester University in 1920, graduating in 1923 with honours in English. He also gained a first class teaching diploma in 1924. Later, in 1944, his thesis on the Oxford Movement resulted in the award of a master's degree by Manchester University. In 1924, in order to study for the priesthood, he went to Ridley Hall in Cambridge. Halliwell was ordained deacon in 1925 by the Bishop of Birmingham, and then served in Aston Parish, Birmingham, before becoming tutor and chaplain at Trinity College Carmarthen from 1927 until 1931 when he returned to parish work in Lancashire. He was first appointed vicar of St George's Church, Wigan, where he raised the funds necessary to undertake the complete re-modelling of the Old Church of St George's. In 1936, he became vicar of St Peter's Church in Chorley before returning to Carmarthen in 1940 as Principal of Trinity College. Trinity College became Trinity University College in 2009 and is now part of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David. Lord Gordon Parry of Neyland, writing in his memoirs of his time as a student at Trinity between 1943 and 1945, described Halliwell as: \\"kindly...intellectually alert and still studying\\". Halliwell ran the college during the Second World War and its temporary union with King Alfred's College, Winchester. Through the fifties and early sixties he instigated the extensive expansion at Trinity College, and personally supervised the raising of half the cost of the building works for that growth. In 1957 Princess Margaret opened the new Women's Hostel Neuadd Non, and in her speech acknowledged the debt Trinity owed to his work. Further expansion followed and in July 1963, Lady Marion Philipps opened further new hostels and the Theatre Complex which is now known as the Halliwell Centre. Halliwell was appointed Canon of Llangan of St David's Cathedral in 1946, and Canon of Llandysillio- gogo and Canon Treasurer of St Davids Cathedral from 1956. Awards and honours Following his retirement in 1965, he was honoured by the University of Wales on 16 July 1966 with a Doctorate of Laws in recognition of his services to education in Wales. In 1966, Halliwell was also presented with a very fine portrait (above) by Patrick Edward Phillips, which was exhibited at the 73rd Annual Exhibition of the Royal Society of Portrait Painters. The portrait may be seen in the Archbishop Childs' Hall at the University of Wales Trinity Saint David's Carmarthen campus. The Theatre and Arts complex at Trinity was re-named 'The Halliwell Centre', in Halliwell's honour, by former principal Clive Jones Davies. Halliwell's services to education in Wales, and to the wider community, were further recognized when, on Maundy Thursday 1982, he became a recipient of the Maundy Money, from Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, at the Maundy Service held at St Davids Cathedral, the first time such a service was held in Wales.

He then publishes the document to the public, proving that he did not abuse his Cabinet position for financial gain, but had been instead victim of blackmail by James Reynolds for his one-year affair with Reynolds's wife Maria Reynolds. The document causes Angelica Schuyler to return from London to support her sister, Hamilton's wife Eliza. She then asks Hamilton angrily if he is satisfied, while Jefferson remarks on how he will never be President as his career has been sullied, which is a boon for the Democratic-Republican Party (\\"that's one less thing to worry about\\"). The song concludes with all of the characters expressing sympathy for Hamilton's wife. =Historical differences= Although the musical Hamilton is based on true events, Miranda does use some dramatic license in retelling the story. In the case of the song \\"The Reynolds Pamphlet\\" the main differences are: *Jefferson, Madison and Burr did not approach Hamilton about his affair, it was James Monroe, Frederick Muhlenberg and Abraham Venable in December 1792 when Hamilton was Treasury Secretary of the first Washington administration. They confronted him on the possible charge of speculation based on the accusations of both James and Maria Reynolds. Hamilton proved he was innocent of public wrongdoing by producing the letters by both Reynoldses proving his payments were related to blackmail over his one-year adulterous affair with Maria. Monroe was a close friend of Jefferson's and shared copies of the Reynoldses' letters with him. Burr may have been aware of Hamilton's affair with Maria Reynolds since he assisted her in divorcing from James in 1793 (when Maria's affair with Hamilton was already long ended) but never mentioned anything in this respect. In the early Summer of 1797, journalist James Callender broke the story of Hamilton's alleged speculation and infidelity. Hamilton blamed Monroe, and the altercation nearly ended in a duel. With nothing left to do, on August 25, 1797 Hamilton published the Reynolds pamphlet. *Angelica's return from London precedes the Reynolds Pamphlet. After twelve years living in Britain, Angelica and husband John Barker Church returned to New York in May 1797,, Book Four, chapter \\"The Woman in the Middle\\" whereas the documents related to the scandal were first published by Callender that summer, with Hamilton announcing the Pamphlet in late July, and subsequent publication in August. Analysis The song refers to the pamphlet penned by Alexander Hamilton in July 1797 (whose original title was Observations on Certain Documents), and the beginning of the song consists of Hamilton's opponents quoting from the document. The song further stands out from many others in the musical courtesy of its use of auto-tune, leading critics to consider it the most modern song on the album. It also incorporates musical cues that point towards earlier songs in the musical, including \\"Satisfied\\". Critical reception The Young Folks considered the song to be the 34th best in the musical, while a community post on Buzzfeed ranked the song 20th. Huffington Post remarked that \\"the mash-up of previous tunes works well\\" and complimented the use of auto-tune. In popular culture During his monologue while hosting Saturday Night Live, Lin-Manuel Miranda referenced the song. Miranda also discussed the song and the eponymous document on an episode of Drunk History.

In 1971, elections were held for the Mayor of Wellington plus other local government positions including fifteen city councillors. The polling was conducted using the standard first-past-the-post electoral method. Background The election saw incumbent Mayor Sir Frank Kitts re-elected for a record equaling sixth term as Wellington's Mayor, defeating his main opponent, former New Zealand Farmers' Union chairman Alexander O'Shea. The Citizens' Association has difficulty in selecting its mayoral candidate with many speculating that it would not opt to contest the position, leading commentators to label them as \\"defeatist\\". Deputy mayor George Porter was approached to stand, but declined the nomination for \\"personal reasons\\", offering himself only for a council seat. Eventually O'Shea was chosen by the Citizens' Association executive over two other undisclosed aspirants. The election also saw a third electoral ticket emerge \\"Civic Reform\\", who would unsuccessfully challenge the two-ticket system that had dominated Wellington's local body politics since the 1930s. Civic Reform also contested the 1974 and 1977 local elections with even less success. The main talking point following the election was that the initial results showed that the Labour Party had won a majority on the council, the first time they had done so. However, following the counting of special votes the fifteenth highest (last successful) polling candidate, Labour's Joe Aspell, lost his seat to Citizens' candidate Ian Lawrence (a future Mayor) after a 23-vote lead became a 17-vote defeat thus leaving the state of parties at 8-7 in favour of the Citizens' Association.

Up to null sets, X can be written as a disjoint union C ∐ D of T-invariant sets where the actions of T on C and D are conservative and dissipative. Thus, if τ is the automorphism of A = L∞(X) induced by T, there is a unique τ-invariant projection p in A such that pA is conservative and (I–p)A is dissipative. Definitions *Wandering sets and dissipative actions. A measurable subset W of X is wandering if its characteristic function q = χW in A = L∞(X) satisfies qτn(q) = 0 for all n; thus, up to null sets, the translates Tn(W) are disjoint. An action is called dissipative if X = ∐ Tn(W) for some wandering set W. *Conservative actions. If X has no wandering subsets of positive measure, the action is said to be conservative. *Incompressible actions. An action is said to be incompressible if whenever a measurable subset Z satisfies T(Z) ⊊ Z then has measure zero. Thus if q = χZ and τ(q) ≤ q, then τ(q) = q. *Recurrent actions. An action T is said to be recurrent if q ≤ τ(q) ∨ τ2(q) ∨ τ3(q) ∨ ... for any q = χY. *Infinitely recurrent actions. An action T is said to be infinitely recurrent if q ≤ τm (q) ∨ τm + 1(q) ∨ τm+2(q) ∨ ... for any q = χY and any m ≥ 1. Recurrence theorem Theorem. If T is an invertible transformation on a measure space (X,μ) preserving null sets, then the following conditions are equivalent on T (or its inverse): # T is conservative; # T is recurrent; # T is infinitely recurrent; # T is incompressible. Since T is dissipative if and only if T−1 is dissipative, it follows that T is conservative if and only if T−1 is conservative. If T is conservative, then r = q ∧ (τ(q) ∨ τ2(q) ∨ τ3(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅)⊥ = q ∧ τ(1 - q) ∧ τ2(1 -q) ∧ τ3(q) ∧ ... is wandering so that if q < 1, necessarily r = 0. Hence q ≤ τ(q) ∨ τ2(q) ∨ τ3(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅, so that T is recurrent. If T is recurrent, then q ≤ τ(q) ∨ τ2(q) ∨ τ3(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ Now assume by induction that q ≤ τk(q) ∨ τk+1(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅. Then τk(q) ≤ τk+1(q) ∨ τk+2(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ ≤ . Hence q ≤ τk+1(q) ∨ τk+2(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅. So the result holds for k+1 and thus T is infinitely recurrent. Conversely by definition an infinitely recurrent transformation is recurrent. Now suppose that T is recurrent. To show that T is incompressible it must be shown that, if τ(q) ≤ q, then τ(q) ≤ q. In fact in this case τn(q) is a decreasing sequence. But by recurrence, q ≤ τ(q) ∨ τ2(q) ∨ τ3(q) ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ , so q ≤ τ(q) and hence q = τ(q). Finally suppose that T is incompressible. If T is not conservative there is a p ≠ 0 in A with the τn(p) disjoint (orthogonal). But then q = p ⊕ τ(p) ⊕ τ2(p) ⊕ ⋅⋅⋅ satisfies τ(q) < q with , contradicting incompressibility. So T is conservative. Hopf decomposition Theorem. If T is an invertible transformation on a measure space (X,μ) preserving null sets and inducing an automorphism τ of A = L∞(X), then there is a unique τ-invariant p = χC in A such that τ is conservative on pA = L∞(C) and dissipative on (1 − p)A = L∞(D) where D = X \\\\ C. :Without loss of generality it can be assumed that μ is a probability measure. If T is conservative there is nothing to prove, since in that case C = X. Otherwise there is a wandering set W for T. Let r = χW and q = ⊕ τn(r). Thus q is τ-invariant and dissipative. Moreover μ(q) > 0. Clearly an orthogonal direct sum of such τ-invariant dissipative q′s is also τ-invariant and dissipative; and if q is τ-invariant and dissipative and r < q is τ-invariant, then r is dissipative. Hence if q1 and q2 are τ-invariant and dissipative, then q1 ∨ q2 is τ-invariant and dissipative, since q1 ∨ q2 = q1 ⊕ q2(1 − q1). Now let M be the supremum of all μ(q) wirh q τ-invariant and dissipative. Take qn τ-invariant and dissipative such that μ(qn) increases to M. Replacing qn by q1 ∨ ⋅⋅⋅ ∨ qn, t can be assumed that qn is increasing to q say. By continuity q is τ-invariant and μ(q) = M. By maximality p = I − q is conservative. Uniqueness is clear since no τ-invariant r < p is dissipative and every τ-invariant r < q is dissipative. Corollary. The Hopf decomposition for T coincides with the Hopf decomposition for T−1. :Since a transformation is dissipative on a measure space if and only if its inverse is dissipitive, the dissipative parts of T and T−1 coincide. Hence so do the conservative parts. Corollary. The Hopf decomposition for T coincides with the Hopf decomposition for Tn for n > 1. : If W is a wandering set for T then it is a wandering set for Tn. So the dissipative part of T is contained in the dissipative part of Tn. Let σ = τn. To prove the converse, it suffices to show that if σ is dissipative, then τ is dissipative. If not, using the Hopf decomposition, it can be assumed that σ is dissipative and τ conservative. Suppose that p is a non-zero wandering projection for σ. Then τa(p) and τb(p) are orthogonal for different a and b in the same congruence class modulo n. Take a set of τa(p) with non-zero product and maximal size. Thus S ≤ n. By maximality, r is wandering for τ, a contradiction. Corollary. If an invertible transformation T acts ergodically but non-transitively on the measure space (X,μ) preserving null sets and B is a subset with μ(B) > 0, then the complement of B ∪ TB ∪ T2B ∪ ⋅⋅⋅ has measure zero. :Note that ergodicity and non-transitivity imply that the action of T is conservative and hence infinitely recurrent. But then B ≤ Tm (B) ∨ Tm + 1(B) ∨ Tm+2(B) ∨ ... for any m ≥ 1. Applying T−m, it follows that T−m(B) lies in Y = B ∪ TB ∪ T2B ∪ ⋅⋅⋅ for every m > 0. By ergodicity μ(X \\\\ Y) = 0. Hopf decomposition for a non-singular flow Let (X,μ) be a measure space and St a non-sngular flow on X inducing a 1-parameter group of automorphisms σt of A = L∞(X). It will be assumed that the action is faithful, so that σt is the identity only for t = 0. For each St or equivalently σt with t ≠ 0 there is a Hopf decomposition, so a pt fixed by σt such that the action is conservative on ptA and dissipative on (1−pt)A. *For s, t ≠ 0 the conservative and dissipative parts of Ss and St coincide if s/t is rational. :This follows from the fact that for any non-singular invertible transformation the conservative and dissipative parts of T and Tn coincide for n ≠ 0. *If S1 is dissipative on A = L∞(X), then there is an invariant measure λ on A and p in A such that :# p > σt(p) for all t > 0 :# λ(p – σt(p)) = t for all t > 0 :# σt(p) \\\\uparrow 1 as t tends to −∞ and σt(p) \\\\downarrow 0 as t tends to +∞. : Let T = S1. Take q a wandering set for T so that ⊕ τn(q) = 1. Changing μ to an equivalent measure, it can be assumed that μ(q) = 1, so that μ restricts to a probability measure on qA. Transporting this measure to τn(q)A, it can further be assumed that μ is τ-invariant on A. But then is an equivalent σ-invariant measure on A which can be rescaled if necessary so that λ(q) = 1. The r in A that are wandering for Τ (or τ) with ⊕ τn(r) = 1 are easily described: they are given by r = ⊕ τn(qn) where q = ⊕ qn is a decomposition of q. In particular λ(r) =1. Moreover if p satisfies p > τ(p) and τ–n(p) \\\\uparrow 1, then λ(p– τ(p)) = 1, applying the result to r = p – τ(p). The same arguments show that conversely, if r is wandering for τ and λ(r) = 1, then . :Let Q = q ⊕ τ(q) ⊕ τ2 (q) ⊕ ⋅⋅⋅ so that τk (Q) < Q for k ≥ 1. Then so that 0 ≤ a ≤ 1 in A. By definition σs(a) ≤ a for s ≥ 0, since . The same formulas show that σs(a) tends 0 or 1 as s tends to +∞ or −∞. Set p = χ[ε,1](a) for 0 < ε < 1\\\\. Then σs(p) = χ[ε,1](σs(a)). It follows immediately that σs(p) ≤ p for s ≥ 0. Moreover σs(p) \\\\downarrow 0 as s tends to +∞ and σs(p) \\\\uparrow 1 as s tends to − ∞. The first limit formula follows because 0 ≤ ε ⋅ σs(p) ≤ σs(a). Now the same reasoning can be applied to τ−1, σ−t, τ−1(q) and 1 – ε in place of τ, σt, q and ε. Then it is easily checked that the quantities corresponding to a and p are 1 − a and 1 − p. Consequently σ−t(1−p) \\\\downarrow 0 as t tends to ∞. Hence σs(p) \\\\uparrow 1 as s tends to − ∞. In particular p ≠ 0 , 1. :So r = p − τ(p) is wandering for τ and ⊕ τk(r) = 1. Hence λ(r) = 1. It follows that λ(p −σs(p) ) = s for s = 1/n and therefore for all rational s > 0. Since the family σs(p) is continuous and decreasing, by continuity the same formula also holds for all real s > 0. Hence p satisfies all the asserted conditions. *The conservative and dissipative parts of St for t ≠ 0 are independent of t. : The previous result shows that if St is dissipative on X for t ≠ 0 then so is every Ss for s ≠ 0. By uniqueness, St and Ss preserve the dissipative parts of the other. Hence each is dissipative on the dissipative part of the other, so the dissipative parts agree. Hence the conservative parts agree.

This cartoon featured Donald at the beach. It was the first Donald Duck series to feature Pluto (although he had previously appeared only paired with Donald in Donald and Pluto). Plot Donald Duck is at the beach singing happily, having a sea bathing and a picnic. After preparing the food, he tries to ride on a rubber horse named Seabiscuit, but gets repeatedly bounced off, annoying him. Donald then spots Pluto sleeping soundly on the shore, and decides to prank him by pushing Seabiscuit near him and mimicking a horse's whinnying. The mesmerized Pluto tries to chase Seabiscuit around some rocky reefs, but he soon gets repeatedly frightened by the horse bumping him from behind. Pluto then frantically tries to press Seabiscuit into the water, to no avail. Getting angry, Pluto bites on the rubber horse's muzzle, accidentally causing its inflation nozzle to pop open, and the air inside to be sucked in his own belly. As the rubber horse goes completely flat, Pluto is sent flying in the air like a deflating balloon and crashes into a shipwreck on the shore. The screen cuts to another scene. Some of the ants unfortunately saw the food, they called for their partners to come and then the numerous ants swarmed toward the picnic foods and carried them around. Donald saw the ants and frantically chased them away. Donald angrily ranted at those ants, and then he decided to put out infinite flypaper to let the ants stick on it to get rid of them. An ant secretly tried to carried away a piece of cake. Pluto spotted it and gobbled it up, but get frightened by the ant, Pluto smelled the ant curiously and followed the ant while the ant tried to escape, in the meantime his buttock became loose. While following the ant, Donald had finished setting the flypaper, he saw the ant and threw a flypaper to the ant, hoping to stick the ant on it. The ant wisely goes beneath the flypaper. But Pluto clumsily get stuck with the flypaper and his nose gets stuck on it, and then the paw, the back, the side, the buttock (similar to the moves in Playful Pluto) with Pluto unsuccessfully removing the flypaper. Donald laughed hysterically, but his laugh faded when Pluto accidentally flew backward and letting the flypaper got stick with his buttock. Donald ranted angrily at Pluto and struggled to free himself. Pluto, felt enraged by Donald's abusive language, run around and swung Donald in circles frantically, and tossed Donald with the flypaper and let out a loud howl, Donald squawked in surprise, and then he flew toward the picnic food and rolled over the infinite flypaper and got stuck with all the flypaper, wrecking his hat and the picnic food and only his head can be seen, while the rest of his body is stick by the flypaper. Donald looked shocked and continued hollered and twisted, trying to get free of numerous flypaper around his body, and Pluto, with an unexpected joy, jumped onto him and licked Donald's face happily and Donald squawked angrily at Pluto, while Pluto enjoy his licking, he let the flypaper stick Donald's face. The film ended with Donald getting his comeuppance and his body completely gets wrapped by the flypaper. Donald squawked in rage, feeling suffocated, as Pluto happily licking him.

A man does not know what he is missing) is a 2013 Dutch documentary film written, directed by and starring Tim den Besten and Nicolaas Veul. The documentary film explores the subjects of sexual fluidity and bisexuality through a gay man's quest to have sex with a woman. The original Dutch title means \\"A man doesn't know what he's missing\\" in English, a reference to a gay man not know what he is missing out on by not having sex with women. The documentary aired on Dutch public television. Plot Tim den Besten (age 26) and Nicolaas Veul (age 29) are documentary makers and friends. They both believe they are gay men, however they set out to test the boundaries of their sexualities. Tim is a lifelong gay man who has never had sex with a woman, but is persuaded to lose his heterosexual virginity. The filmmakers aim to explore whether or not \\"everyone is bisexual\\", as is the case in some animal species, as well as what the boundaries of gay male sexuality are. Tim wants to find out if his sexual orientation is as fixed as he believes it to be or if he might not be as gay as he thinks. The documentary opens with Nicolaas interviewing Tim about the issues of homosexuality and sex with women. Nicolaas questions Tim, asking him what it means to be \\"gay\\" and what Tim's own \\"gayness\\" entails. Nicolaas asks Tim if he sleeps with women or has in the past. Nicolaas encourages Tim to experiment with his sexuality. Nicolaas relates to Tim that, while he identifies as gay, sleeping with women was surprisingly enjoyable and that trying sex with women helped him realize he was not as exclusively gay as he believed himself to be. Nicolaas tells Tim he wants him to have sex with a woman, causing Tim to decline the suggestion and claim he would never sleep with a woman. Nicolaas insists that Tim should sleep with a woman, engaging in a debate with Tim about the merits of sex with women, with Tim eventually agreeing and coming to the conclusion that gay men having sex with women is the correct thing to do. Tim further adds that he has no reason not to try it and that sleeping with a woman would give him a better understanding of his own sexuality. Nicolaas relates that after trying so hard to be gay, including coming out to parents and society as well as being involved in the gay community, it can be very difficult for a gay man to \\"go back\\" and start sleeping with women again, but that the stigma shouldn't deter gay men from heterosexual experimentation. During the documentary, Tim and Nicolaas visit a sex coach to give them lessons on heterosexual intimacy and female sexuality and help prepare Tim. They also visit a bonobo habitat to learn about the bisexual behavior exhibited by bonobos. They visit with science journalist Asha ten Broeke, who offers her view that all human beings are bisexual. Tim arranges to meet a pornographic film actress in France who wants to have sex with an openly gay man. The porn actress, Judy Minx, tells Tim she has only had sex with straight men, but is enthusiastic about sex with a gay man in order to explore the boundaries of homosexuality and go beyond homosexuality's binary limitations. The film culminates with Tim losing his heterosexual virginity by having unsimulated sexual intercourse with Judy Minx, while Nicolaas films the sexual encounter. During their encounter, Tim tries vaginal sex, performs cunnilingus, and receives heterosexual fellatio for the first time. Afterwards, Tim high-fives Judy and gives the thumbs-up sign to Nicolaas, excited that he's just finished having his first straight sex. Nicolaas is smiling and asking how things went, while Tim explains to Nicolaas that the sex was excellent and he was surprised by how easy it was for him to perform. One month later Nicolaas interviewed Tim again, with Tim reiterating that he was glad he tried heterosexual sex and still considered it to have been a very enjoyable experience. However, Tim makes clear that his homosexuality has not been \\"cured\\" as he is still sexually and romantically attracted to men. It was the goal of Tim and Nicolaas to reject the compartmentalization of human sexuality into the categories of \\"gay\\" or \\"straight\\" by exploring sexual fluidity and bi-curiosity. Tim believes the film was a success because he accomplished what he set out to do by answering whether a gay man could have satisfactory sex with a woman. The answer was \\"yes\\", because Tim was able to perform readily and enjoy the experience. Tim described his experience of sleeping with a woman by saying, \\"Can you be gay and still have satisfying sex with a girl? I did it and it was quite a revelation.\\" Controversy The film caused controversy in the Netherlands, with some denouncing the film as prurient or homophobic. Because the documentary was publicly financed by the Dutch television channel VPRO, some objected to the government paying a gay man to have sex with a woman. One Dutch newspaper headline read: \\"Gay wants sex with woman, using your taxpayer money.\\" Other critics objected to showing unsimulated sex on television. VPRO received many angry letters from viewers, particularly gay men who felt the program encouraged a \\"gay cure\\". Tim defended the film, claiming it was not homophobic because he is gay and simply wanted to see if sex with a woman would be physically arousing. While some of Tim's friends criticized him as shameless, his parents were supportive of the film. In an interview with de Volkskrant magazine, Tim said he announced to his father, \\"Dad, I'm going to have sex with a girl\\" during a dinner party. Tim described this as a \\"second-coming out\\" and said that his father was supportive of his choice. In an interview with Dutch journalist Fleur Baxmeier, Tim said his parents attended the premier of the film, but sat in the hallway during the sex scene because they didn't want to watch their son having sex. Reaction from the Dutch daily morning newspaper De Telegraaf was negative. The newspaper dismissed the program as a \\"sex dating show\\". The newspaper declared that \\"VPRO is looking for heterosexual girls for gay boys\\". Noting that Tim den Besten had made an appeal on the internet for a woman to take his heterosexual virginity, De Telegraaf wondered how many women would want to sign up for such a program. In an interview with Nieuwe Revu, Dutch television presenter Rutger Castricum defended the documentary by saying that fears the film advocated a cure for homosexuality were nonsense and members of the gay community who complained about the film looked ridiculous. Bram de Wijs, a gay drummer for the Dutch band expressed concern with the film's \\"awkward and homophobic\\" and \\"nasty\\" premise, likening it to homophobic people who ask gay men how they can know they are gay if they haven't had sex with a woman and macho men who believe that lesbians need to find the right man. De Wijs denies den Besten's homosexuality, declaring him to be \\"not a bit\\" gay. Background In an interview with HUMO magazine, Nicolaas Veul stated it was his idea for Tim den Besten to have sex with a woman on film. Nicolaas and Tim would often talk about sexual matters, but when Nicolaas asked Tim if he'd ever had sex with a woman, Tim replied that he had no interest. From these conversations, Nicolaas developed the idea of Tim losing his heterosexual virginity and basing a film around the event that would explore the topics of bisexuality and sexual fluidity. At the outset, Nicolaas identified as a gay man but had dated and had sex with women in the past, and although Tim had dated a woman before, he identified as a gay man and had never slept with a woman. Tim was initially hesitant about losing his heterosexual virginity, but found himself increasingly aroused by Nicolaas's suggestion that he sleep with a woman, eventually deciding to go ahead with the project. Tim decided to sleep with a woman because he felt it important to challenge the Dutch taboo on sexual experimentation. While Tim still identifies as gay he has stated he is glad he slept with a woman and learned much from the experience, while Nicolaas has stated he found the effect of the project to be so interesting that it has motivated him to consider having sex with women again. In an interview with de Volkskrant, Nicolaas stated that while Tim had always insisted he would never have sex with a woman, Nicolaas believed Tim was capable of enjoying heterosexual sex. Although Tim felt initial resistance to the concept, Nicolaas states that overcoming Tim's resistance and capturing the results on film was the purpose of the documentary. Nicolaas says he previously slept with a woman to prove he was a \\"real man\\", but wants to truly enjoy sex with women in the future.

One of the most common methods for selecting a channel from an input signal is to first shift the frequency by multiplying it with a complex sinusoid, then passing the signal through a low pass filter.

Frederick's father, Landgrave Charles I, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel had often come here for hunting.

Almost 180 programmes have been implemented between the two European organisations in areas such as human rights, culture, democracy, and the rule of law.  History   Issues  = Accession of the European Union to the Council of Europe = In May 2005, the Member states of the Council of Europe, meeting in Warsaw, expressed their wish to see the European Union join the Council of Europe and the European Convention on Human Rights. In practice, the Court of Justice of the European Union rulings have already been delivered in such a way as to be consistent with the rulings of the European Court of Human Rights. This accession is not intended to subordinate the European Union to the Council of Europe, nor even to amend the treaties. This would make it possible to subject to external control the respect for fundamental rights to which the Union's institutions are already subject. The accession of the European Union was to be made possible by the ratification of Protocol 14 to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. On 5 April 2013, the European Union and the Council of Europe finalised a draft agreement for the EU's accession to the European Convention on Human Rights. In order to be adopted, the draft agreement had to be submitted to the opinion of the EU Court of Justice, followed by unanimous support from the member states for accession, two-thirds support from the European Parliament and ratification by the national parliaments of the Council of Europe member states. However, on 18 December 2014, the Court of Justice delivered a negative opinion (No 2/2013) on the accession of the European Union to the ECHR. The process therefore came to a halt. After this stalemate, some Italian senators put forward a new proposal, based on a partial merger of the two courts. = Confusion between the two organizations = The two institutions are often confused, which has led the Council of Europe to try to distinguish itself from the EU. Thus, the Council of Europe website includes a section entitled \\"Do not get confused\\" which summarises the various institutional points that need to be distinguished. This confusion is mainly caused by the closeness of the names of their bodies and institutions.

Jean-Baptiste followed his father as lawyer in the bailiwick and bought a number of biens nationaux sold to the criminal court where his brother Joseph worked during the French Revolution. Joseph later worked at the Cour de cassation and was ennobled by Napoleon, taking the title Baron Dunoyer and becoming a State Councillor. In fact after the Revolution both Jean-Baptiste and Joseph secured permission to change their name to that of their mother in order to dissociate themselves from their brother.« Coffinhal Dunoyer (Joseph) », Biographie Universelle, Ancienne et moderne, vols 5-6, 1847, p. 96. Coffinhal himself began by studying medicine like his older brother Pierre but soon gave it up. He went to Paris, where he found a position as a clerk in a prosecutor's office.Bulletin de la Société française d' Histoire de la médecine, Paris, Alphonse Picard & fils, 1903, chap. 2, p. 239  Revolutionary tribunal rue Le Regrattier 16, where Coffinhal lived in 1793 (plaque). He was enthusiastic about the French Revolution and took an active part in the political life of the city. He was an elector for the Section de l'Île-Saint-Louis (renamed Section de la Fraternité in 1792) for the 1791 French legislative election and in the elections the following year for the Convention. He was then appointed police commissioner for this Section. A member of the Jacobin club, he took part in the storming of the Tuileries palace in August 1792 and became a judge in the special criminal court set up shortly afterward on 17 August. At some point he followed the minor fashion for adopting classical names (e.g. Gracchus Babeuf, Anacharsis Cloots) and took to calling himself Mucius Scaevola Coffinhal.W.R. Aykroyd, Three Philosophers: Lavoisier, Priestley and Cavendish, Butterworth- Heineman 2014 p.183 When the Revolutionary Tribunal was set up on 10 March 1793, he was named as one of its judges and thereby became a friend of Fouquier-Tinville. accessed 5/5/2017 Politically close to Maximilien Robespierre, he behaved with a zeal and an intransigence that bred a deep hatred among his enemies, along with his tendency for misplaced witticisms.Ernest Desplaces, Joseph-François Michaud, Louis-Gabriel Michaud, Biographie Universelle Ancienne et moderne, Madame C. Desplaces, 1854, vol. 8, p. 529-530 A year after the Revolutionary Tribunal was established, Coffinhal presided at the trial of Jacques-René Hébert and the Hébertistes (March 1794), for which as well as directing the proceedings he was responsible for editing the official report. Produced in collaboration with three colleagues, his account bore little resemblance to the actual exchanges of the trial. In 1795, the discovery of various documents relating to the direction of trials over which he had presided proved that he had suppressed and altered much of the evidence, as his fellow-judge Féral had claimed in evidence on 9 Vendemiaire Year III (30 September 1794). accessed 5/5/2017 He also presided at the trial of Antoine Lavoisier and the Farmers General. It was during the course of this trial when he is said to have uttered the famous response to the appeal from Lavoisier's wife that he should be reprieved in order to pursue his scientific research: 'La République n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes' ('The Republic has no need of scientists or chemists.')Commenting on this quotation, Denis Duveen, an English expert on Lavoiser and a collector of his works, wrote that \\"it is pretty certain that it was never uttered\\". For Duveen's evidence, see the following: .The French 'n'a pas besoin de savants' might also be translated as 'has no lack of scientists' or 'has no shortage of scientists', which would change the meaning, if indeed he actually said this.According to the 'Le Dictionnaire de pédagogie de Ferdinand Buisson' (1911) the phrase was first employed by Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy in a speech he gave at the Lycée des Arts on 14 Thermidor Year IV commemorating Lavoisier, having actually found it in a report on vandalism by Henri Grégoire. Before this, the phrase had never actually been uttered. Likewise, Édouard Grimaux in 'Lavoisier, 1743-1794' Ayer Publishing 1888 p.376 indicates that the phrase has been attributed by different authors to Coffinhal, to René-François Dumas, or to Fouquier-Tinville, but that neither Fourcroy nor Jérôme Lalande, in his 'Notice sur la vie et les ouvrages de Lavoisier'(1795) make any mention of an appeal for clemency in behalf of Lavoisier. On 11 June 1794, the Tribunal was reorganized, and Coffinhal was made one of its three vice-presidents.François Wartelle & Albert Soboul (dir.), Dictionnaire Historique de la Révolution française, PUF, coll. « Quadrige », 2005 Six weeks later he presided over the trial of those accused in the Luxembourg Conspiracy and condemned the poet Andre Chenier, only three days before the Thermidorian reaction which brought him down. accessed 5/5/20178 Thermidor  In the evening of 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794) Coffinhal with 8 or 10,000 men from the sections and a company of artillery succeeded to bring Hanriot from the Committee of General Security to the Hôtel de Ville, Paris.Richard T.

Hamel (1867) Histoire de Robespierre, p. 342 Coffinhal managed to escape and made his way along the banks of the Seine to the Île des Cygnes where boatmen from his home region of Cantal concealed him. Eventually hunger forced him to break cover, and on 5 August he made for the house of his mistress Mme Nègre in the rue Montorgueil, but she refused to take him in. He came across someone who owed him money, who agreed to hide him, and then went straight to the police to denounce him.W.R. Aykroyd, Three Philosophers: Lavoisier, Priestley and Cavendish, Butterworth- Heineman 2014 p.195Antoine-Denis Bailly, Choix d'anecdotes anciennes et modernes, Roret, Librairie, 1828 p.242 Nine days later Coffinhal was arrested, totally exhausted. Coffinhal was imprisoned in the Conciergerie. His cellmate Fouquier-Tinville heard him shouting abuse at Hanriot and other supporters of Robespierre until the early morning. The Revolutionary Tribunal itself had been suspended by this time, and he was condemned to death on 18 Thermidor (6 August 1794) by the criminal tribunal of the département, based on simple identification. The same day, the tumbrel took him on his own from the Conciergerie to the Place de Grève where he was guillotined. It is said that as he mounted the scaffold, the jeering crowd yelled at him the phrase he had used so much when presiding at the Revolutionary Tribunal - 'Coffinhal, tu n'as pas la parole!'

It is one of two closely located dry lake beds located near where the Kokoda Track crosses the crest of the Owen Stanley Range – also known as \\"the Gap\\" or \\"the Kokoda Gap\\". Myola, the smaller of the two lake beds, was located and named by Lieutenant Bert Kienzle on 3 August 1943. It became a major resupply point and drop zone for Australian forces during the Kokoda Track campaign. Kienzle then cut a track toward Eora Creek which rejoined the original track at Templeton's Crossing, which he also named. Myola was named (there being no local name) for the wife of his friend and commanding officer, Major Sydney Elliot-Smith. Myola is an Australian aboriginal word meaning \\"dawn of day\\". The second, larger lake bed to the immediate north is referred to as Myola 2, with the smaller lake bed being sometimes known as Myola 1. Myola 2 was developed as the major resupply point as the Australian forces advanced, following the Japanese forces as they withdrew from Ioribaiwa Ridge back toward Kokoda. A strip was developed at Myola 2, being a larger area but it was considered too risky for general use. Major General George Vasey landed at Myola 2 when he relieved Major General Arthur Allen on 28 October 1942.
