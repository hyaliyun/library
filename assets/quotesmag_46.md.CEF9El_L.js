(now Agenus) that is evaluated in multiple clinical trials. It has been granted fast track and orphan drug designations from the US Food and Drug Administration for kidney cancer, metastatic melanoma, and glioma. The investigational agent is not yet approved in the US but was approved in Russia in April 2008 for patients who have earlier-stage kidney cancer. The European Medicines Agency is evaluating conditional approval for Oncophage. Oncophage is one of a group of new drugs called cancer vaccines that intend to train the body's immune system to fight the cancer. While chemotherapy is often accompanied by severe side effects, cancer vaccines tend to have only minimal ones (often only inflammations of the injection site). In April 2009, the World Vaccine Congress named Oncophage as the best therapeutic vaccine.http://www.terrapinn.com/2009/wvcwawards/ However, after a negative opinion from the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) on 19 November 2009, Antigenics Inc. decided to withdraw their application for approval by the European Medicines Agency shortly after on 23 November 2009. Description Oncophage (Vitespen) is a vaccine made from a patient's tumor by extracting heat shock protein gp96 and its associated peptides.http://www.antigenics.com/products/cancer/oncophage/ Clinical trials One trial is evaluating the investigational agent alone in patients with first recurrence of glioma while the second trial is evaluating Oncophage (Vitespen) in combination with Temozolomide, a common chemotherapy, in patients that are newly diagnosed with brain cancer. A first phase I clinical trial in glioma extended median survival of the group of patients, which was diagnosed with multiple recurrencies of glioma, to over 10 months.

MacDonald (born February 11, 1943) is an American insurance entrepreneur, business consultant, blogger, and author of business books. MacDonald began his career as a door-to-door salesman and became a CEO of three major insurance companies. He was president of ITT Life Insurance Company, and was a founder and CEO of Life USA. He sold Life USA in 1999 to Allianz SE for $540 million and became CEO of Allianz Life of North AmericaAgents Sales Journal, January, 2008 before retiring in 2002. With a 40+-year career in the financial services industry, MacDonald has been cited in the media as a business maverick,Best‚Äôs Review, December, 2007 who has ‚Äúearned a reputation as a business contrarian who rewrote the rules of business and corporate culture.‚ÄùTwin Cities Business Monthly, Sept. 2005. He was twice voted Entrepreneur of the Year in Minnesota.Twin Cities Business Monthly, Aug. 1998 MacDonald has since 2002 headed CTW Consulting, LLC, a vehicle he used to offer his experience and unique approach to management, marketing and corporate culture development.  Early life  Robert W. ‚ÄúBob‚Äù MacDonald was born in Rochester, New York, the son of middle-class parents. His father had been a mortician before World War II, but later became an X-ray technician after developing an allergic reaction to embalming chemicals. His mother also worked in the medical field as a nurse and medical secretary.'Cheat To Win ‚Äì The Honest Way to Break All the Dishonest Rules in Business. The MacDonald family moved West in 1946, first to Arizona and then to California where MacDonald spent most of his formative years. A rebellious and often mischievous youth, MacDonald‚Äôs parents attempted to shape up the youth by sending him to the highly structured St. John's Military Academy and then to Loyola High School, a Jesuit college preparatory school for young men in hopes of reforming his contrarian lifestyle, but his disrespect for traditional rules continued. Although he grew up in a family of health care specialists, he was hired as a 17-year-old high school junior by Coast Federal Savings & Loan of Los Angeles (now merged with Bank of the West) to deliver patriotic speeches to rotary clubs, churches, veterans‚Äô groups and other organizations. He was paid $50 a speech plus gas mileage and $1 for every audience member. He often earned hundreds of dollars each week.  MacDonald‚Äôs Maverick Lifestyle  MacDonald‚Äôs contrarian lifestyle first came to the notice of national media when he bluffed his way into the 1960 Democratic National Convention headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles. The 17-year-old MacDonald spent a week mingling with delegates, and rubbing shoulders with John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson, and Bobby Kennedy (who gave MacDonald a PT-109 tie clip). A suspicious newspaper reporter finally discovered MacDonald‚Äôs fraud. The now defunct Los Angeles Herald-Examiner profiled MacDonald the following day as ‚ÄúThe Delegate Who Isn‚Äôt Spins a Yarn.‚ÄùLos Angeles Herald-Examiner, July 15, 1960 MacDonald pulled a similar prank later during the 1960 presidential campaign when John F. Kennedy was the featured speaker at a rally at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. MacDonald faked his way onto the stage where the youthful prankster was seated a few feet from JFK.  Business career  In 1965, MacDonald became a neophyte ‚Äúknock-on-the-door‚Äù insurance agent for New England Mutual Life (later absorbed by Metropolitan Life . MacDonald then built sales agency in Southern California for Jefferson-Pilot (now Lincoln Financial Group ), served as director of marketing support for State Mutual of America (became Allmerica Life, defunct, find under Hanover Insurance) and was chief marketing officer, chief operating officer, then president and CEO of Minneapolis-based ITT Life, owned by The Hartford . As president and CEO of ITT Life Insurance Corp., he became ‚Äúone of the best known, most influential and controversial leaders in the life insurance industry, flamboyant in an industry in which flamboyance is rare and usually unrewarded.‚Äù The New York Times described MacDonald as ‚Äúan innovator and unrepentant bad boy in the go-along-to-get- along insurance.Minneapolis StarTribune, June 3, 2005 In the early 1980s, as president of ITT Life Insurance, he launched a public campaign against his industry's most popular family of policies -- whole life. ‚ÄùHe had the bad taste to say what everybody knew: Whole life insurance had ceased to be a good buy‚ÄùForbes, March 29, 1982 and further charged the insurance industry with being ‚Äúossified, petrified, myopic and inbred.‚ÄùUSA Today, October 21, 1982 In response, he was vilified by his peers.Fast Company.

Riza is notable in that he was the young police force's first recognized hero. Special Force career Kosovo first began working towards its independence in the 1990s, this heightened when NATO took action against the forces of Yugoslavia, and the United Nations dispatched International Police with its UNMIK organization to stabilize the region. With the birth of the Kosovo Police Service, UNMIK Police were tasked with training and organizing the newly formed police force. One of the main concerns quickly became organized crime, with both the Albanian and Bulgarian mafia immediately taking advantage of the weak economic situation in Kosovo, to set up prostitution and illegal drug rings. Enver Sekiraqa quickly climbed to the top of organized crime, and was arrested several times for illegal weapons and other charges, but never received a sentence exceeding six months in jail. This was believed due to corruption within the court system of Kosovo. Death Triumf Riza was one of the earlier officers hired onto the new Kosovo police force. Well known within Kosovo as a competition body builder, and in excellent physical condition, Riza quickly gained a position on the Kosovo Police Protection Unit, guarding VIP personnel and visitors to Kosovo. Corruption within the Kosovo Police Force became apparent even in its earliest stages, much due to the low salaries paid to the officers. Organized crime factions, when unable to bribe Kosovo officers, used intimidation as a means to gain an upper hand over any they deemed a threat to their business. Triumf Riza, however, refused bribes offered, resulting in two assassination attempts, both of which were thwarted when he engaged his attackers, the second time resulting in a gunfight. These incidents resulted in Riza becoming an especially respected \\"hero\\" within the young police force, which was much needed as a boost for morale due to the force having suffered several officers killed over its young existence, in addition to its ongoing battle with internal corruption, low salaries, and non-existent insurance for injured officers. The feud between Riza and Enver Sekiraqa escalated when Riza became involved romantically with locally well known singer Adelina Ismajli, previously involved with Sekiraqa. On August 30, 2007, Riza was ambushed on a crowded street in broad daylight and shot to death in Pristina. He was the third Kosovo Police Officer killed in 2007. The incident sparked outrage from the public, resulting in over 3,000 protestors marching in down town Pristina. Within days the Kosovo Police and UNMIK Police had arrested some thirty persons in connection with the conspiracy to murder Riza, quickly narrowing that number to eight, with one confessing to the shooting. That suspect has since been sentenced to Kosovo's maximum prison sentence. However, Enver Sekiraqa is believed to have organized the assassination, but fled Kosovo immediately following the murder. Former freedom fighter and now Kosovo Prime Minister Agim Ceku, Interior Minister Blerim Kuqi, and politician and former soldier Fatmir Limaj joined in the protest against organized crime.

Born in Los Angeles and adopted at the age of four, she started to sing and play piano while staying in various foster homes and began writing songs early. Jenni Alpert is the first unsigned independent artist to ever release an album (Take It All, produced by Mikal Blue) on iTunes under the Mastered for iTunes category which was mastered by Eric Boulanger the designer of Mastered for iTunes. And that isn't the only time she was a pioneer for something new. As familiar with jazz as she is pop, Alpert graduated from UCLA's Ethnomusicology Department as the first jazz vocalist to complete four-year jazz music program headed by Kenny Burrell. Inspired by the fusion of soul, folk, jazz, and pop, Alpert began self penning songs, co-producing, and recording concept genre albums coining the genre Soul-Americana with her unique take to sound. No stranger to the recording studio, she independently released five albums before signing a licensing deal with Scurve Records (Steve Greenberg) to release her sixth album Until Then recorded live in the studio in one take in Nashville, TN with guitarist Guthrie Trapp. Her music and biological reunion story caught wind of adoptees around the country when the documentary about her life and reunion with her birth father \\"Homeless: the Soundtrack‚Äù, filmed and edited together by Emmy Award-winning director Irene Taylor Brodsky, was accepted and screened at the Tribeca Film Festival. Additionally, Independent Singer-Songwriter Jenni Alpert has performed in over 14 countries (United States, Spain, England, Scotland, Ireland, The Netherlands, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Australia, India, Nepal, Canada, Mexico, and Israel) with no formal representation rather solely through the support of fans, acquiring radio play on UK's the BBC, PBS Australia, Triple J, and Sirius XM Radio: The Coffee House.. After years of being estranged from both her birth parents from having been placed in the foster care system to be adopted out in the early years of her life, and having missed the opportunity to met her birth mother when she was still living, years later with the assistance of a private investigator, Alpert found and reunited with her biological father. During their first meeting, which was initially all that had been intended, upon introducing herself as her birth nickname \\"Cami\\" to connect the early dots of both their pasts, she discovered he was happily homeless, running from the law, and addicted to drugs, but also a musician just like her. A few weeks into their reunion her birth father chose to leave a life of petty crime and drugs behind to join forces with Alpert. As their incredible developing relationship took flight, she met Chockstone Productions producers Steve and Paula Mae Schwartz, who upon hearing details their reunion story and reading ‚ÄòHome is Where My Heart Is‚Äô the self penned article by the duo of Alpert's adoption and of their biological reunion story published by Groknation edited by friend Mayim Bialik, Chockstone producer Steve Schwartz introduced Alpert to award-winning who is an Oscar-nominated, Peabody and Emmy winning documentary film director Irene Taylor Brodsky who later followed, filmed, and interview, the dynamic duo during the second phase of their relationship detailing their life stories apart as well as their reunion and now life together. As Alpert aided her birth father through different stages of rehabilitation, acclimation, and self-discovery also getting to know him musically through developing and recording a music report together, documentary maker Brodsky filmed many days of them together editing what was to become the documentary short \\"Homeless: The Soundtrack‚Äù which was selected and screened at Tribeca Film Festival 2018 and honored with a Jury Award, won best short film at Nantucket Film Festival 2018, had a one-week run at the Laemmle Royal Theater in West Los Angeles, and is short listed for an IDA award in the short doc category. Her music has been featured on well known US TV shows like ABC's Castle, CBS's CSI Miami, MTV's The Real World, Teen Mom and 16 and Pregnant. Live, Alpert has supported artists such as Loudon Wainwright III, Luka Bloom, Jon Allen, and Kaki King both in the US and in Europe. Upon releasing her first few independent albums on iTunes, Alpert was selected to record her song Untied by The Sun Studio Sessions for PBS at Sun Studios in Memphis, TN, recording home of Elvis, Johnny Cash, Howlin‚Äô Wolf, and B. B. King. Shortly thereafter while touring internationally, an Italian vinyl label (Cappuccino Records), recorded and released a collection of acoustic performances live in Italy. While continuing to tour independently traveling and performing in the US, Jenni recorded a selection of soulful sultry songs live in one take with guitarist Guthrie Trapp in Nashville TN, which eventually garnished the attention of SCurve Records who signed her to a licensing deal and released the album Until Then./ After having recorded several times in different studios spanning over a few years, the collection of songs found on her most recent fully produced full- length album Nothing Less best reflects and captures her multi-genred soundscape. And upon having reunited with her birth father also a musician, together they recorded in the studio the EP: Biological Reunion featuring her birth father's virtuosic guitar playing. Alpert's early independent releases include Pieces (2005) produced by drummer producer Jimmy Paxson and Stevie Blacke, 27 Minutes in Bologna (2007) a live vocal and piano set recorded in Italy produced and recorded by Nicola Fantozzi, No Second Guesses (2008) produced by Julian Coryell son of Larry Coryell (except tracks where noted, produced by Jimmy Paxson or Jimmy Messer) mixed by Niko Bolas, and mastered by George Massenburg,Julian Coryell#cite note-Look-1 which received strong radio play in the Netherlands and was the catalyst for an invitation to do a series of live radio shows hitting most of the Netherlands pop radio airwaves: 'Shouting Boots' Radio 6, Radio 5 at Oba live, Tros Radio Muziekcafe Radio 2, Radio One at Link Atlas, V-radio/Veronica 'studio Schram' lead to supporting the UK artist Jon Allen on his Dutch tour, Underneath the Surface (2010) produced by Brad Smith of Blind Melon which features an ensemble of musicians Jimmy Paxson (drums, Stevie Nicks Ben Harper), Lenny Castro (percussion, John Mayer), Chris Chaney (Bass, Jane's Addiction), Zac Rae (synths Alanis Morissette), and Stevie Blacke (strings, Pink), Take It All (2012) produced by Mikal Blue (Colbie Caillat, Brendan Willing James, Five for Fighting), a fresh blend of pop songs featuring Chris Chaney (Bass), Victor Indrizzo (drums), Dave Levita (guitar), Jeff Babko (organ), Zac Rae (synths), and Stevie Blacke (strings), Shining Light (2013) Alpert's first vinyl, a live performance recorded in Italy, and her most recent work Until Then (2015) released by SCurve Records.

Early life  Alpert was born in Los Angeles and adopted at the age of four. While spending time in various foster homes, she began to sing and play the piano. Later in her musical development, she learned to play the guitar and started to write poetry and songs. Alpert was selected as one of the first vocalists and granted a scholarship to complete UCLA's Ethnomusicology Department the four-year jazz music program headed by Kenny Burrell, which granted her the opportunity to study and perform with the likes of Herbie Hancock and Barbara Morrison.

Chang (born 1954) is an American writer, translator, and academic. He was born and raised in Taiwan and did his postgraduate study in the United States. He works primarily in the areas of philosophy of communication, media theory and criticism, and cultural studies. He is considered the first scholar to bring to bear the ideas of Jacques Derrida on the field of communication studies and media studies.Van Wyck, Peter. (2004) Telling Stories. The Semiotic Review of Books. Vol. 14.2 (2004) p. 3 In his book, Deconstructing Communication: Representation, Subject, and Economies of Exchange (1996), he demonstrates the limits of phenomenology by showing how it fails to address the question of intersubjectivity and proposes a la Derrida the idea of ‚Äúpostal principle‚Äù as fundamental to any theory of communication and mediation. This idea is elaborated in his subsequent writings and forms the perspective behind much of his works after Deconstructing Communication.For a detailed account of his thesis, see Cooren, Francois (1999) Deconstructing Communication.

An extension of the line from the Bochum Central Station south to the Ruhr-University Bochum and to Hustadt opened for service on 28 November 1993.

More than two-thirds of this line runs underground.BOGESTRA -- Daten und Zahlen Only the southernmost six stations are at grade, in the portion of the U35 line that runs in the median of a highway. On this section, there are three at- grade road crossings, which renders it not a true metro system but a light rail one.

The other Stadtbahn lines that were planned for the Bochum Stadtbahn system were never finished, but portions of those planned lines were built and are in use by transit. In Bochum, two more tunnels were built under the city center, one east-west tunnel and one northeast-southwest tunnel. Both of these have four underground stations. In Gelsenkirchen, a tunnel was built as well ‚Äì it begins at the train station and from there heads north, via the city center.

KCTA operates on a clear channel frequency (not to be confused with Clear Channel the company) but is limited in its broadcasting hours. It must protect the Class A station on the frequency, WBZ Boston, from interference. KCTA is allowed to broadcast only during daytime hours. (The station holds an unusual \\"limited time\\" license (see FCC regulation 73.1725) which would allow operation at night during hours not used by WBZ.

History KCTA was first authorized to operate in 1944 as KWBU on 1010 kHz. The station was co-owned by Baylor University and Carr P. Collins, which later formed the Century Broadcasting Company. The station moved to 1030 in 1945 under a series of Special Service Authorizations (SSAs); two years later, Baylor bought back the station. It attempted to move KWBU to Houston in a docket that was dismissed in 1949. As the FCC continued to grant the station SSAs to operate, KWBU was transferred to the Baptist General Convention of Texas in 1950. It would not be until 1954 that KWBU was properly licensed. On January 1, 1957, concurrent with the sale of the station to Broadcasters, Inc., KWBU became KATR.

Description and history The Old Post Office is located in Liberty's village center, set close to the south side of Main Street (Maine State Route 173), two doors east of the public library. It is a small single-story eight-sided wood frame structure, covered by a low-pitch octagonal roof and clapboard siding. It has no foundation beyond a small amount of rubblestone to provide a level surface, and is built on top of hand-sawn beams measuring in cross section. The only entrance is in the street-facing facade, with sash windows in the other seven walls. Rufus Carter, a local harness maker, built this building in 1870 for use as his harness shop. In 1878 it was acquired by G.H. Cargill, who was then the town postmaster, and he put it to use as the local post office. It served as the town post office in 1960, and is now maintained as a museum by the local historical society. It is believed to be the only octagonal post office building in the nation.

Background OPTEVFOR traces its origins to the final months of World War II when the need arose for an effective means to combat Japanese kamikaze attacks. On 2 July 1945, the Composite Task Force, U.S. Atlantic Fleet, was formed to develop tactics and evaluate equipment to counter the Kamikazes. This force was commanded by Vice Admiral Willis A. Lee, USN, and consisted of miscellaneous types of combatant ships and drone aircraft. Following the end of World War II, the Composite Task Force was consolidated with other fleet units doing development work and in December 1947, was re-designated as the Operational Development Force (OPDEVFOR), with the force commander flying his flag on the USS Adirondack (AGC 15), as an operational command reporting to Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In 1949, the command moved ashore to the Norfolk Naval Base. With its expanding OT&E; responsibilities, a subordinate liaison command, located the San Diego Naval Base, created to serve as a liaison with the U.S. Pacific Fleet. VX-6 was one of six air development squadrons formed by the United States Navy beginning in 1946 to develop and evaluate aircraft tactics and techniques. These squadrons were initially directed by the Operational Development Force, which was redesignated in May 1959 as the Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR). These six squadrons were initially designated as VX-1 (tail code XA), VX-2 (tail code XB), VX-3 (tail code XC), VX-4 (tail code XF), VX-5 (tail code XE) and VX-6 (tail code XD). On 1 January 1969, the surviving Air Development Squadrons (VX-1, VX-4, VX-5 and VX-6) became Air Test and Evaluation Squadrons. Their designations were changed to VXE-1, VXE-4, VXE-5 and VXE-6. Their tail codes of these squadrons were changed to JA, JF, JE and JD, respectively. In May 1959, the command was renamed Operational Test and Evaluation Force (OPTEVFOR) to reflect more accurately its increased responsibilities regarding weapon systems and tactics testing and evaluation (T&E;). In 1960, the OPTEVFOR headquarters moved to its present location, mocated off Terminal Boulevard near the U.S. Atlantic Fleet headquarters. Due to Congressional and DOD initiatives to improve the defense acquisition process, in 1971, OPTEVFOR was designated the Navy's sole (OT&E;) agency, with greater involvement in the research and development (R&D;) process and production decision-making process. In keeping with these expanded responsibilities, the Force Commander (COMOPTEVFOR) began reporting directly to the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). In 2013, the COMOPTEVFOR was the lead operational test agency who, along with Joint Staff, J6 Joint Deployable Analysis Team (JDAT), coordinated the 11th Bold Quest coalition demonstration. Warfighters, technology teams and testers under the flags of 10 nations and each of the U.S. military services came together at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, N.C. to stress test the IFF integrated suite and Aegis ballistic missile defense system Mode 5 in partnership with COMOPTEVFOR under 13 separate initiatives. JDAT assisted the COMOPTEVFOR with Identification Friend or Foe (IFF) Mode 5 Level 1 Joint Operational Test Approach analysis to validate the interoperability of fielded combat systems and served as COMOPTEVFOR‚Äôs lead analysis organization, responsible for all reconstruction and coordination of issues with Service program offices, and producing a detail report of results for submission to DOT&E.; Mission =Scope of Responsibilities= COMOPTEVFOR provides OT&E; policy direction, technical and procedural guidance, and financial support for the independent and objective testing and evaluation of the systems and tactics at the direction of the Chief of Naval Operations (CNO). For operational control of fleet units, COMOPTEVFOR reports to the Commander, U.S. Fleet Forces Command (COMUSFF); the Commander Pacific Fleet (COMPACFLT); and the Commander, U.S. Naval Forces Europe (COMUSNAVEUR). It also closely follows all R&D; programs within the Navy and its laboratories, with the CNO authorizing direct liaison between COMOPTEVFOR and the heads of development agencies involving all technical matters for Navy research, development, testing, and evaluation. Evaluation of systems are done by personnel with technical experience with the equipment being tested and evaluated. Finally, OPTEVFOR coordinates operational test and evaluation (OT&E;) activities with the operational test agencies of the other U.S. military services as well as the DOD Director of Operational Test and Evaluation, who establishes operational test policy for the U.S. Defense Department. =Fleet RDT&E; Support Process= The Fleet Research, Development, Test & Evaluation (RDT&E;) Support ProcessFleet RDT&E; Support Process - OPTEVFOR conforms to the most current version of SECNAVINST 5000.2 pertaining to Navy or multi-service testing and evaluation (T&E;) activities.SECNAVINST 5000.2C supersedes SECNAVINST 5000.2B effective 19 November 2004 It recommends that T&E; requests for fleet commander support be made in writing, via CNO-OPNAV (N091/N912), nine (9) month prior to the actual testing activity. The Fleet RDT&E; Support Process defines the appropriate formats for request for T&E; activities. Fleet RDT&E; Support Process defines the levels of fleet commander support as follows: *Dedicated support, which precludes employment of the supporting unit(s) in other missions. *Concurrent support, which permits employment of the supporting unit(s) in activities other than RDT&E; support, but could have an operational impact upon unit employment. *Not-to-interfere-basis (NIB) support, which permits RDT&E; operational employment of the supporting unit(s) without significant interference with primary mission accomplishment. The Fleet RDT&E; Support Process also mandates that all T&E; requests be submitted and updated on a quarterly basis beginning nine (9) months prior to the quarter that the T&R; activity in order to provide adequate scheduling for the fleet command, and mandates that CNO-OPNAV (N091/N912) be promptly notified of any cancellations. The Fleet RDT&E; Support Process defines prioritization of fleet commander support for T&E; activities as follows: *Priority One - Fleet commander support of a T&E; activity takes precedence over normal fleet operations. *Priority Two - Fleet commander support of a T&E; activity takes precedence within normal fleet operations. *Priority Three - Normal fleet operations take precedence over fleet commander support of a T&E; activity. Finally, the Fleet RDT&E; Support Process also defines unscheduled RDT&E; support requirements, including the appropriate format for Emergency Fleet Support Requests. The Commander, Operational Test and Evaluation Force (COMOPTEVFOR) is designated as the RDT&E; fleet-support scheduling agent for CNO (N091), including all at- sea operational test and evaluation (OT&E;) activities.

It is anchored by J. C. Penney and two Belk stores. It is a regional mall located about one mile (1.6 km) north of the Charlottesville city limits on U.S. Route 29 in unincorporated Albemarle County. History Construction was started on the mall, by the Leonard L. Farber Company, by early 1979, with an opening date set for March 1980. By February 1980, Miller & Rhoads, J. C. Penney, Sears, and Leggett had been announced as anchors, with 75 other interior tenants already confirmed. The mall opened on March 5, 1980, drawing a crowd of 4,000. At opening, the mall had only two anchors, with Leggett not set to open until March 26, and J. C. Penney not expected to open until March 1981. In January 1990, Miller & Rhoads closed its location at the mall, with merchandise being shipped to other stores recently purchased by The May Department Stores Company. The mall was renovated in 1990, coinciding with the opening of several new tenants such as Gap Kids, Victoria's Secret, and Express. In 1996, the mall was purchased by Shopping Center Associates, from previous owners CFS Associates Limited. The mall was renovated again, beginning in 1999 and finishing in 2002. The $8.5 million renovation improved lighting and seating within the mall, as well as new decor intended to give the mall a more modern feel, including the removal of umbrella motifs dating to the mall's opening. On December 28, 2018, it was announced that Sears would be closing as part of a plan to close 80 stores nationwide. The store closed in March 2019. In February 2020, it was reported that the mall was facing \\"imminent default\\" on $45.2 million of loans. This came following an increasing number of store closures in the mall, as well as the mall being downgraded to a \\"non-core\\" property by owners Washington Prime. On August 20, 2020, it was announced that J. C. Penney would also be closing in November 2020 as part of a plan to close 155 stores nationwide which will leave the two Belk stores as the only anchors left.https://dailyprogress.com/news/local/fashion-square-j-c-penneys-to- close/article_3226d44a-47c0-57c6-bf74-796006eb456d.html  See also  * The Teeth of the Tiger, which caused a minor controversy over its depiction of the mall as the site of a terrorist attack.

As a work of his youth, it was thus also a commissioned work on which Zola cut his teeth. In it, he himself saw the amount of will and work that he had to expend to elevate himself to the literary effort of the Rougon ‚Äì Macquart novels. Indeed, in this popular novel, typical of the genre in its various and unexpected twists and turns, we can already see his style, his palate for real life, his indignation about injustice, and his art of depicting social strata (the wealthy, the clergy, the deviants, the common man) as well as events (the revolution of 1848, the cholera epidemic). With this canvas as a background, [he has painted] a breathtaking adventure, the thrilling story of an impossible love, that resembles the love of liberty. It has been translated as The Mysteries of Marseilles (1895, London: Hutchinson) and as The Mysteries of Marseille (2008, New York: Mondial), both translations by Edward Vizetelly. Plot introduction Les Myst√®res de Marseille recounts the love of Philippe Cayol, poor, untitled, republican, and of young Blanche de Cazalis, the niece of De Cazalis, a millionaire, politician and all- powerful in Marseilles.

A simpler version can be made by merely mixing tomato ketchup with mayonnaise. The sauce was popularised in the 1960s by British celebrity chef Fanny Cradock. It is often accompanied with seafood, and prawns in particular.\\"Prawn cocktail with Marie Rose sauce\\" by John Torode, from the Celebrity MasterChef, website: https://www.bbc.com/food/recipes/prawn_cocktail_with_13755, accessed 2018 Origins The sauce is often credited to Fanny Cradock who certainly made it widely known; but variations exist internationally, and seafood cocktail sauces predate her 1967 recipe by some years. For example, Constance Spry published a recipe for Tomato Ice, a chilled mixture of mayonnaise and sweetened tomato pulp, in 1956 for use as the base of a prawn cocktail. The American cocktail sauce is a horseradish and ketchup-based sauce that is served with seafood, and dates back considerably earlier. Although this is not the same sauce as Marie Rose it is served in the same distinctive style in a prawn or shrimp cocktail; and it has been suggested that US cocktail sauce, made milder for British tastes, was the precursor of Marie Rose sauce. The connection with the name Marie Rose is also not clear. Cradock is sometimes credited with the name, or there is an association with the British warship the Mary Rose. However the Mary Rose Trust itself has debunked this, saying \\"As we still have a number of divers on our team who were around during this period, so we can ask them. Not one of them has any recollection of this happening... since the Mary Rose was in the news a lot during this period, it becomes clear that some people did the sums and came up with a nice story to justify the result.\\" Similar sauces =United States= In the United States, a similar sauce, fry sauce, is sometimes served with french fries. Another similar sauce called Thousand Island dressing is popular in the United States and Canada. The Thousand Island dressing recipe reputedly originated from the Thousand Islands between the state of New York and the province of Ontario. In Argentina, salsa golf is a similar sauce created in the 1920s at a golf course, hence the name. =Ireland= In Ireland, Marie Rose sauce () refers primarily to just ketchup and mayonnaise, and often salt and pepper. Marie Rose sauce in chip shops is usually known as \\"burger sauce\\", though there are many names in use. However, the above British versions are also used in Ireland. The name used is dependent on where it is being served (e.g. chip shop) and what the sauce is being accompanied with (such as chips or salad). More formal recipes may also incorporate ingredients such as horseradish, herbs, and a splash of Irish brandy. Some restaurants may top or accompany Marie Rose sauce with Irish cheddar cheese.

Modern Algerian literature, split between Arabic and French, has been strongly influenced by the country's recent history. Known poets in modern Algeria are Moufdi Zakaria, Mohammed Al Aid from the middle of the 20th century, and Achour Fenni, Amar Meriech and Azrag Omar in the late 1980s. Famous novelists of the 20th century include Mohammed Dib, Albert Camus, Kateb Yacine, and Ahlam Mosteghanemi, while Assia Djebar is widely translated. Among the important novelists of the 1980s were Rachid Mimouni, later vice-president of Amnesty International, and Tahar Djaout, murdered by an Islamist group in 1993 for his secularist views.Tahar Djaout French Publishers' Agency and France Edition, Inc. (accessed 4 April 2006) In philosophy and the humanities, Jacques Derrida, the father of deconstruction, was born in El Biar in Algiers, Malek Bennabi and Frantz Fanon are noted for their thoughts on decolonization, Augustine of Hippo was born in Tagaste (modern-day Souk Ahras), and Ibn Khaldun, though born in Tunis, wrote the Muqaddima while staying in Algeria. Algerian culture has been strongly influenced by Islam, the main religion. The works of the Sanusi family in pre-colonial times, and of Emir Abdelkader and Sheikh Ben Badis in colonial times, are widely noted. The Latin author Apuleius was born in Madaurus (Mdaourouch), in what later became Algeria. Music The Algerian musical genre best known abroad is ra√Ø, a pop-flavored, opinionated take on folk music, featuring international stars such as Khaled and Cheb Mami. In Algeria itself, ra√Ø remains the most popular, but the older generation still prefer shaabi, as performed by for instance Dahmane El Harrachi. While the tuneful melodies of Kabyle music, exemplified by Idir, Ait Menguellet, or Loun√®s Matoub, have a wide audience. For more classical tastes, Andalusi music, brought from Al-Andalus by Morisco refugees, is preserved in many older coastal towns. For a more modern style, the English born and of Algerian descent, Potent C is gradually becoming a success for younger generations. Encompassing a mixture of folk, ra√Ø, and British hip hop, it is a highly collective and universal genre. Although is welcomed and praised as a glowing cultural emblem for Algeria, there was time when ra√Ø's come across critical cultural and political conflictions with Islamic and government policies and practices, post-independency. Thus the distribution and expression of ra√Ø music became very difficult. However, \\"then the government abruptly reversed its position in mid-1985. In part this was due to the lobbying of a former liberation army officer turned pop music impresario, Colonel Snoussi, who hoped to profit from ra√Ø if it could be mainstreamed\\".Gross, Joan, David McMurray, and Ted Swedenburg. \\"Arab Noise and Ramadan Nights: Ra√Ø, Rap, and Franco-Maghrebi Identities.\\" Diaspora 3:1 (1994): 3- 39. [Reprinted in The Anthropology of Globalization: A Reader, ed. by Jonathan Xavier and Renato Rosaldo. In addition, given both nations' relations, Algerian government was pleased with the music's growing popularity in France. Although the music is more widely accepted on the political level, it still faces severe conflictions with the populace of Islamic faith in Algeria. Media Visual arts =1910: a generation of precursors= During the first half of the twentieth century, artists mainly recuperated models and patterns imported ‚Äì or imposed ‚Äì by an imperialist French power. As Edward Said argued in his book Orientalism in 1978, Algerian artists struggled with the perception and representations of Westerners. Almost a century after the conquest by the French, Azouaou Mammeri (1886‚Äì1954), Abdelhalim Hemche (1906‚Äì1978), Mohammed Zmirli (1909-1984), and Miloud Boukerche (1920‚Äì1979) were the first to introduce easel painting. They benefited from \\"breaches\\" in the educational system and were able to pursue a training in plastic arts. Even though they attempted to focus on the reality of Algerians' everyday routine, they were still to a certain extent incorporated in the orientalism movement. The tradition of oriental illumination and miniature was introduced around the same period, through artists such as Mohamed Racim (1896‚Äì1974) or Mohamed Temman (1915-1988). It is the two main expression of figuration in a country where popular abstract symbolic, Berberian or Arabic, are integrated mainly through architecture, furnitures, weaving, pottery, leather and metal workmanship. How to reappropriate one's own history is a dynamic in Algerian contemporary art, reflecting on the deep social changes people experienced. Artists attempt a successful introspective work in which the duality in terms of identity creates a dynamic that overcomes \\"orientalism\\" and exotism. The main stake is for the artist and the spectator to reappropriate a liberty of expression and interpretation. Main artists of that period are: Boukerche, Benaboura, Ali Ali Khodja, Yelles, or Baya. =1930: a generation of founders= The vast majority of the artists incorporate the thematic of the independence war, from those who lived it to the artists that use it as a legacy. Impregnated by all the artistic and ideological movements that marked the first half of the twentieth century, artists are concerned with the society they live in and denounce segregation, racism and injustice that divided communities of colonial Algeria. A clear shift in operated from orientalism and exoticism: new themes such as the trauma and the pain appear, for instance in the portrait The Widow (1970) by Mohamed Issiakhem. \\"Art is a form of resistance as it suggests and makes visible the invisible, the hidden, it stands alert on the side of life\\". It was also a time when Algerian artists start organizing themselves, through the National Union of Plastic Arts or UNAP (1963) for instance; artists such as Mohamed Issiakhem or Ali Khodja were part of it. =Non-figuration and \\"Painters of the Sign\\"= Abdallah Benanteur and Mohamed Khadda opened a path for abstract (non-figurative) Algerian art. They were French since childhood and emigrated to France. They were followed by artists such as Mohamed Aksouh, Mohamed Louail, Abdelkader Guermaz and Ali Ali-Khodja. Mohamed Khadda wrote: \\"If figurative painting appears as the norm in terms of expression, it is the result of an acculturation phenomenon\\". Artworks liberately figurative are a form of liberation in that sense, as literal representations do not seem to fully emerge from the cluster of exotism and orientalism. The \\"Painters of the Sign\\" are Algerian artists born in the 1930s who, at the beginning of the 1960s, found inspiration in the abstract rhythm of Arabic writing. The term \\"peintres du Signe\\" was coined by the poet Jean S√©nac in 1970. He was hosting in Alger the \\"Gallerie 54\\". The first collective exhibition reunited Aksouh, Baya, Abdallah Benanteur, Bouzid, Abdelkader Guermaz, Khadda, Jean de Maisonseul, Maria Manton, Martinez, Louis Nallard and Rezki Z√©rarti. He wrote in his presentation: \\"In this gallery 54, which aims at being a gallery of research in permanent contact with the people, we have brought together artists, Algerian or having deep links with our country\\" \\"We can assert, with Mourad Bourboune, that our artists do not only exhume the devastated face of our Mother, but, in the midst of the Nahda (renewal), they build a new image of the Man and stare endlessly at his new Vision\\" =Aouchem= Algerian artists reconnected with part of their historical and cultural legacy, especially the influence of Berber culture and language. A great deal of attention was brought upon the Berber culture and identity revendications after the Berber Spring in 1988, and it impacted the cultural production. Denis Martinez and Choukri Mesli participated in the creation of the group Aouchem (Tattoo), which held several exhibitions in Algiers and Blida in 1967, 1968 et 1971. A dozen artists, painters and poets decided to oppose the mainstream organization of art ‚Äì especially of figurative art, they believe to be represented by the UNAP, the National Union for Plastic Art. They opposed their policy of excluding many active painters. According to its manifesto : \\"Aouchem was born centuries ago, on the walls of a cave of Tassili. It continued its existence until today, sometimes secretly, sometimes openly, according to fluctuations of history. (...) We want to show that, always magical, the sign is stronger than bombs\\". In spite of a surge of political violence following the war of independence, where the hegemony of the Arabic culture and language tended to overlap on the berberian culture, the plastic traditions of popular signs managed to maintain. Aouchem builds on this traditional legacy. =Naivety and expressionism= Since the 1980s, there has been a renewal and also a form of \\"naivety\\", trying to go past the trauma of the war and address new contemporary issues. Baya (1931‚Äì1998) is the example of a great Algerian success story. Her work was prefaced by Andr√© Breton and exposed by Andr√© Meight when she was still a teenager. She who has not known her mother as she was doubly orphaned by the age of 5, produced colorful watercolors with fake symmetries, questioning the figure of the Mother. She is part of the art brut movement. Expressionism was dominated by Mohamed Issiakhem, affectionately nicknamed \\"Oeil de lynx\\" (lynx eye) by his fellow writer Kateb Yacine. When he was 15, he had an accident with a grenade. Two of his sisters and his nephew died, his forearm had to be amputated. His personal drama resonates in work. He expressed themes like grief and loss through the use of thick pastes and universal figures; as an echo of the hardships of the Algerian war, as well as the universal struggle of those silenced and oppressed. =Renewal of visual arts= Since the 1980s, a new generation of Maghrebi artists has arisen. A large proportion is trained in Europe. Artists locally and among the Diaspora explore new techniques and face the challenges of a globalized art market. They are bringing together various elements of their identity, marked by the status of immigrant of first or second generation. They address issues that speak to the Arab world with an \\"outsider\\" lens. Kader Attia is one of them. He was born in France in 1970. In a large installation in 2007 called Ghost, he displayed dozens of veiled figures on their knees, made of aluminum fold. Adel Abdessemed, born in Constantina in 1970, attended the √âcole des Beaux-Arts in Algiers, Algeria and then Lyon, France. Through his conceptual artworks, he displays strong artistic statements using a wide range of media (drawing, video, photography, performance, and installation). In 2006, he exposed at the David Zimmer gallery in New York City. One of his artworks was a burnt car entitled Practice Zero Tolerance, a year after riots in France and in the midst of a resurgence of terrorist attacks since 11 September 2001. Katia Kameli also brings in the multiple aspects of her identity and environment, through video, photographs and installations. Cinema Sports Football, handball, athletics, boxing, martial arts, volleyball and basketball are the most popular sports in the country.

Biography Braunstein graduated as a physician in 1962, at the age of 20, and received his M.D. in 1965 from the Universidad Nacional de C√≥rdoba, Argentina, where he taught at college level as early as 1959. In 1974 he was forced into exile for political and academic reasons and moved to Mexico where he worked as a psychiatrist in different public institutions for the treatment of both children and adults. Braunstein is a naturalized citizen of Mexico. He is currently a graduate studies professor, a practicing psychoanalyst and an active writer. In 1978 he was banned from his duties and positions in all Mexican psychiatric institutions because of his critical epistemological views on the official taxonomies of the so-called mental illnesses (then DSM-III and CIE-10. Immediately after arriving in Mexico he published (with some chapters written by Marcelo Pasternac, Frida Saal and Gloria Benedito): Psicolog√≠a: Ideolog√≠a y ciencia in which he demolishes academic psychology and denounces its conceit as a true science. Instead, Braunstein proposed psychoanalysis as an alternative and as a methodological tool to deal with human subjectivity and to redirect the study of psychology. The book had enormous success: 24 editions were printed between 1975 and 2008 (more than 70,000 copies sold). This work helped to change the ideological landscape in almost every school of psychology in Spanish speaking countries of Latin America and the author was invited to lecture about his ideas on psychology and psychoanalysis to commemorate the 20th, 25th and 30th anniversary of the first edition of the book. In 1980 he published a pioneering book dealing with Lacanian psychoanalysis, the first to appear in Mexico, Psiquiatr√≠a, teor√≠a del sujeto, psicoan√°lisis. (Hacia Lacan) which was also received with general acclaim; 14 editions were printed and is widely read, referred to and quoted. Beginning in 1981 he became the editor of a continuously reprinted series of books, Coloquios de la Fundaci√≥n with 13 titles published that helped to expand the knowledge of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in Latin America. Between 1975 and 2005 he taught Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis in the Graduate Studies Department of Clinical Psychology at the Facultad de Psicolog√≠a of the Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico and since 2005 he has been teaching in the Facultad de Filosof√≠a y Letras of that same institution. He is a member of the board and professor in the Ph.D. in Critical Theory of 17, Instituto de Estudios Cr√≠ticos and Secretary of the Administrative Board of Siglo Veintiuno Editores . In Mexico, he introduced Lacan's teachings by different means in different venues. He taught the first course devoted to Lacanian Studies (UNAM, 1977), published the first Mexican article on Lacan (Lust, Mexico, n¬∞ 1, 1979) and wrote the forementioned book Psiquiatr√≠a, teor√≠a del sujeto, psicoan√°lisis (Hacia Lacan. In 1980 he co-founded a pioneering institute devoted to the Lacanian clinic (Fundaci√≥n Mexicana de Psicoan√°lisis). Braunstein was also the chairman and co-founder of the first officially recognized psychoanalytic teaching institution in the country (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Psicoanal√≠ticos, 1982) where he taught until 2003. He is active in the psychoanalytic lecturing circuit and has given opening or closing lectures in several international symposiums including the following: Bogota (Pontificia Universidad Javeriana, 1991 , Beijing (Psychoanalysis International Symposium, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing April, 2001), Paris (Lacan, 100 ans, la Sorbonne, January 23, 2000), New York City (Columbia University and Fordham University, 1992 and 2008 Apres-Coup announcement of Columbia lectures, Madrid (Universidad Complutense, Master en Teor√≠a Psicoanal√≠tica 1993 and 1997) , Istanbul (Istanbul'da Psykanaliz, Etkinlikleri S√ºr√ºyor, September, 2001), Rome(Fondation Europ√©ennne pour la Psychanalyse, RSI /Eros-ion, Les peintures de Leonardo Cremonini, May, 1999) and Santiago de Chile (Universidad Andr√©s Bello. Menci√≥n Psicoan√°lisis, April 2000) . Beginning in 1985 he has traveled constantly to different cities of America and Europe imparting seminars on Lacanian psychoanalysis. As a cultural journalist specializing in psychoanalysis he has written many articles for general and specialized Mexican newspapers (Excelsior, Uno M√°s Uno, Reforma, Este Pa√≠s, El Universal, Revista de la Universidad Nacional Aut√≥noma de M√©xico). He is active as a member of the editorial boards in several psychoanalytic journals published in Spanish, French, Portuguese and English (see below) and he has translated a number of literary and psychoanalytic texts into Spanish. Works and ideas Braunstein recognizes the following authors as the main influences on his thought: Jacques Lacan, Sigmund Freud, Friedrich Nietzsche, Louis Althusser, Jorge Luis Borges, Jacques Derrida, Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek and Giorgio Agamben. His works have dealt with a variety of subjects in terms of the relationship between psychoanalysis and culture: philosophy from Plato to Wittgenstein and Derrida; literature from Sophocles to Sebald and Christa Wolf; the visual arts; music; opera; film theater; history; theology; medicine; neuroscience; law; linguistics; anthropology; academic psychology; pedagogy; politics; psychiatry and daily life in the 21st century. Since 2003 he has turned his attention to the subject of memory, articulating the meaning and research on the ability to remember in psychoanalysis and its constant references (Sigmund Freud and Jacques Lacan) and those sources that can be derived from other disciplines such as literature, philosophy, history and neuroscience. In his best known work Goce Jouissance. A Lacanian Concept, he argues that the nucleus that holds psychoanalytical clinic and theory together is the concept of jouissance, which can be minimally defined as \\"the ways in which a body is affected by language\\". In this sense he argues that psychoanalysis can be understood as a sort of science of jouissance in the speaking being, a sophisticated knowledge that has been carefully constructed, first by Freud, continued by Lacan and still ongoing. In his last book published in French, Depuis Freud, Apr√®s Lacan (Ramonville, √âr√®s, 2008) Braunstein posits his theory of three different periods in the history of psychoanalysis. They can be emblematically traced to the year 1900 (Freud's era, under the predominance of the discourse of the Master), 1950 (Lacan's times, under the hegemony of the discourse of the Capitalist) and our present age (year 2000), ruled by the omnipresent and anonymous discourse of the Markets.

Russo (born February 6, 1959) is a former American politician, city attorney, and city manager with municipal management experience in four cities in the state of California. Russo was a member of the Oakland City Council from 1994‚Äì2000, where he served as finance committee chair and became a leading advocate for fiscal accountability and government reform. In September 2000, he became the first elected city attorney of Oakland, California after a little-debated aspect of Jerry Brown's strong-mayor initiative, Measure X, changed the city attorney post from an appointed to an elected one.Janine DeFao, \\"Russo Vows Reform as Oakland City Attorney,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, 9/13/2000 Russo served as the president of the League of California Cities from 2002‚Äì03, serving a total of nine years on the board. In 2007, during his second term as city attorney, Russo ran unsuccessfully for the California Assembly 16th District seat in 2006. In June 2008, Russo was re-elected to a third term as city attorney, running unopposed. In 2011 Russo was named the city manager for neighboring Alameda, California.Rumors confirmed: Oakland city attorney wants out Keith Gleason, \\"Russo to the Rescue: Alameda's CEO Enters the Fray,\\" Alameda Magazine\\", May‚ÄìJune 2012 In 2015, Russo was named the city manager of Riverside, California.{http://alamedaca.gov/city- manager/news/2015/02/23/city-manager-john-russo-headed-riverside City Manager John Russo Headed to Riverside} He served in that position for nearly three years, establishing practices of reform and accountability and increasing projects in arts and culture, including initiating the deal to bring the Cheech Marin Center for Art, Culture, and Industry to Riverside.{https://riversideca.gov/press/riverside-city-manager-john-russo- honored-nurturing-cheech-marin-center} According to the Press Enterprise, \\"Russo, who has served as City Manager since 2015, has been behind initiatives like the Sunshine Ordinance to improve transparency in city government, a more robust budget process and a rotating system of audits of all city departments.\\"{https://www.pe.com/2016/06/20/editorial-budget-outlook- brightens/} In 2018, the Irvine City Council voted unanimously to name Russo as the city manager for Irvine, California. In 2019, Russo was included on The Orange County Register list of 100 Top Influencers {https://www.ocregister.com/2019/12/23/most-influential-meet-orange- countys-100-top-influencers-for-2019/}  Background  John Russo was born and raised in the Italian immigrant Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn, New York. His father, a construction worker and union vice president, and his mother, a dressmaker, moved to the United States from London in 1958 five months before he was born. Russo attended Xaverian High School in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn, NY. He graduated with honors in economics and political science from Yale University and earned his law degree from New York University School of Law. After a two-year stint as a Legal Aid attorney in St. Louis, Missouri, Russo moved to Oakland in 1987. He served as president of Friends of Oakland Parks and Recreation, treasurer of the East Bay League of Conservation Voters, and pro bono attorney to several neighborhood associations and non- profits.William Wong, \\"John Russo, A Councilmember to Watch,\\"Oakland Tribune, Jan 6, 1995. In June 1994, John was elected to the Oakland City Council, where he became the council's leading advocate for fiscal accountability and government reform. In his six years on the council, John implemented community policing, developed the first balanced budget in a generation, and working closely with the League of Woman Voters, authored Oakland's open government law called the \\"sunshine\\" ordinance.John Russo, \\"Why California Should be the True 'Sunshine' State: The Importance of Open Government to Local Democracy,\\" pgs 3-5, Western City Magazine, August 2003, p. 3-5. In 2002, John served as president of the League of California Cities spearheading initiatives to protect local tax revenues from state fiscal mismanagement and amend California's Constitution to ensure public access to government records and decision-making. His ability to work 'across the aisle' earned him a seat on the Board of the National League of Cities, an organization which represents more than 18,000 towns and cities, in December 2003.Chris McKenzie, \\"A Warrior for Local Democracy: How One Man Rocked the League,\\"Western City Magazine, July 2007.  Neighborhood Law Corps  In 2001, Russo founded the Neighborhood Law Corps, an organization to help address chronic urban problems. Law Corps attorneys, generally new law school graduates, focus on quality-of-life issues and tackle cases involving drug dealing and building- code violations. The Law Corps also led Oakland's crackdown on liquor stores considered a blight on the community because they were providing a haven for drug dealing and other nuisances. In 2006, the National League of Cities named Oakland as one of nine winners of its 2006 award for municipal excellence, and one of three Gold award winners honoring the work of the Neighborhood Law Corps.\\"Oakland Law Corps Wins 'Profound Honor',\\" Oakland Tribune, December 5, 2006.  Open Government Program  As city attorney, Russo created the Open Government Program. The program ensured that citizens of Oakland have full access to information about their city and that the business of city government would be conducted in the light of day. Three pieces of legislation were cited to support the intent of the Open Government Program: The Ralph M. Brown Act (California Law, Government Code, Sections 54950 ‚Äì 54962): The California Public Records Act (California Law, Government Code, Sections 6250 ‚Äì 6277); the Oakland Sunshine Ordinance (Title 2, Chapter 2.20).  Riders' settlement  In 2003, Russo's office negotiated the largest legal settlement in Oakland municipal history.Janine DeFao, \\"Oakland settles 'Riders' Suits: Record $10.5 Million Payout,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, February 19, 2003 Plaintiffs who claimed they were victimized by a group of rogue cops known as \\"the Riders\\" shared $10.5 million in damages. The settlement brought major changes to police department operations and dealings with the public. The case riveted the city as it was the largest case of police misconduct in Oakland in decades. Despite the settlement's hefty price tag, Russo said the cases could have cost the city tens of millions of dollars more had they gone to trial, pointing out that the victims had spent more than 25 years, combined, imprisoned on false charges. By comparison, Los Angeles spent $40 million to settle litigation stemming from the Rampart corruption scandal. The payout went to 119 plaintiffs who filed federal civil rights lawsuits claiming four police officers kidnapped, beat and planted drugs on them during the summer of 2000. The plaintiffs alleged that the Oakland Police Department either encouraged or turned a blind eye to the abuse. U.S. District Court Judge Thelton Henderson approved the settlement in the civil cases after 18 months of negotiations. > We did not bury our heads in the sand. We acknowledged freely our faults, > and we've worked arm in arm toward fixing the problem rather than hiding > from or denying the problem,\\" said City Attorney John Russo. \\"A lot of the > plaintiffs are people who have bad histories with the law,\\" Russo said. But > \\"there are some people who did not have trouble with the law who got caught > up in this kind of overzealous behavior. And even people who are career > criminals are entitled to their constitutional rights.\\" In addition, he said, the settlement prevented the U.S. Justice Department from imposing changes on the police department through consent decree, as it has done in other cities facing police misconduct scandals such as Los Angeles. Russo said the changes will make it easier for police brass to identify problem officers and deal with them. > At the high point of their careers, the so-called \\"Riders\\" were considered > the best and the brightest, veterans whom rookie police officers tried to > emulate. Their specialty: bringing in reputed drug dealers in record numbers > from the crime-plagued streets of West Oakland.Liz Garone, \\"Oakland's Police > 'Riders' on Trial: Officers Lauded for Drug Busts Are Accused of Brutality > by Ex-Colleague,\\" Washington Post, January 26, 2003 The alleged abuses came to light after a rookie officer, just 10 days on the job and fresh out of the police academy, resigned and reported his former co- workers' activities to the police department's internal affairs division.  Anti-bias policy  In 2002, two city of Oakland employees had posted fliers in the workplace advertising the \\"Good News Employee Association,\\" a group created to promote \\"natural family, marriage, and family values.\\" The flier also said, \\"We believe the natural family is defined as a man and a woman, their children by birth or adoption, or the surviving remnant thereof.\\"Kris Larson, \\"Oakland's Anti-Bias Policy Stands,\\" Bay Area Reporter, June 19, 2008 The fliers were posted in response to a celebratory message sent from openly gay former City Council member Danny Wan to city staff on National Coming Out Day in 2002. One flier was posted just outside the cubicle of a lesbian colleague. When she complained about the homophobic fliers, the city attorney's office conducted an investigation and concluded \\"the fliers were causing a workplace disruption and were in violation of the city's anti- discrimination policy,\\" according to Angela Padilla, one of the lawyers representing the city in the initial court case. The plaintiffs stated in their deposition that gay and lesbian employees were like \\"weeds\\" in the workplace, and that their intention was \\"to keep [the workplace] from spoiling, to keep it from rotting, to keep it from deteriorating.\\" The plaintiffs were invited to post different fliers without discriminatory language, but instead they elected to sue the city over violation of their free speech rights. The case went to court, and the bulk of the case was dismissed in March 2004, while the free speech issues were dismissed in July 2005. According to 9th Circuit Court Judge Richard Clifton, the flier presented homosexuality as something that hurt the \\"integrity\\" of the workplace, violating the city of Oakland's policy of non-discrimination based on sexual orientation in the workplace. The plaintiffs then appealed to the Supreme Court, but the court declined to hear the appeal. The case received national attention when Washington Post columnist George Will denounced the city of Oakland for infringing on the plaintiffs' free speech rights.George F. Will, \\"Speech Police, Riding High in Oakland,\\" Washington Post, June 24, 2007 In his response to Will, printed in the San Francisco Chronicle, Russo reminded readers that the plaintiffs were deliberately attempting to exclude their LGBT co-workers. Russo pointed out that rather than being only a liberal issue, it was a conservative judge, a Bush appointee, who said, \\"It's hard to avoid the inference, 'We lack ethics, we lack integrity because these people are here.'\\"John Russo, \\"Harmful Speech Needs Policing,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, June 28, 2008  Seat belt sting  In 2007, Russo was caught in a law enforcement campaign to catch seat belt scofflaws. Russo was ticketed and the incident ended up in the local media.Heather McDonald, \\"Oakland City Attorney Nabbed in Seat Belt Sting,\\" Oakland Tribune, May 24, 2007 In a San Francisco Chronicle interview, Russo acknowledged that he wasn't wearing his seat belt when he was pulled over by officers at about 5:30 p.m. on Piedmont Avenue in Oakland. He said he had been distracted as he left the popular Fentons Creamery with his twin 8-year-old sons in the back seat of his 2004 Honda Civic hybrid.Henry K. Lee, \\"Oakland City Attorney Caught in Seat Belt Sting,\\" San Francisco Chronicle, May 24, 2007 In response to the ticket, a tongue-in-cheek Public Service Announcement was produced with Russo, his twin sons, and a friend, to contribute to the national law enforcement PR campaign, \\"Click it or Ticket\\" which included a video posted to YouTube and an ad that appeared among other locations, the Oakland BART station.  Awards  In 2006, the National League of Cities named Oakland as one of nine winners of its 2006 Award for Municipal Excellence, and one of three Gold award winners honoring the work of the Neighborhood Law Corps. In 2005 the program won the Grand Prize, Helen Putnam Award for Excellence from the National League of Cities. In August 2005, John Russo was voted a Northern California Super Lawyer by his peers and the independent research of the Law & Politics Magazine. In 2004, the League of California Cities gave John Russo the Champion of Local Democracy Award for his work to strengthen democracy at the local level. In addition, the California Minority Counsel Program (CMCP) awarded the Office of the City Attorney the John Essex and Guy Rounsaville In- House Diversity Counsel Award for demonstrating superior commitment to diversity; it was the first time a public agency had received the honor in the thirteen-year history of the program. In 2003, California Lawyer Magazine named John Russo as Attorney of the Year for Government/Public Policy. The eighth annual CLAY (California Lawyer Attorneys of the Year) Awards for 2003 recognized City Attorney Russo for his advocacy and innovation in public law while saving taxpayer money. > As lead defense counsel for the city of Oakland, Russo settled a civil suit > alleging widespread police misconduct for $10.8 million, only $2.2 million > of which came from taxpayers, with the rest paid by excess insurers. Despite > this payout, he managed to reduce city spending on lawyers and lawsuits by > $3.5 million compared with the previous fiscal year.

These include ls, cp, mv, and about 150 others. The Toybox project was started in 2006, and became a BSD-licensed BusyBox alternative. Toybox is included with Android 6.0 \\"Marshmallow\\" and all later Android versions (i.e. on all currently supported Android versions), and is also available for installation on certain other operating systems.  Functionality and aim  Toybox aims to provide a BSD licensed replacement for the GPL licensed BusyBox. Toybox's major technical design goals are simplicity, smallness, speed and standard compliance. Toybox is POSIX-2008 and LSB 4.1 compatible, and doesn't focus on having every option found in GNU counterparts. Toybox is licensed using a permissive BSD license, where BusyBox uses the copyleft GNU General Public License, which lead to different usage domains. Busybox is mostly used in the copyleft FOSS domain, while Toybox is used mostly with permissive licensed projects and by commercial companies, e.g. Google's Android, which is an explicit target of Toybox.celf-2015.txt by Rob Landley (2015) Feature-wise, Toybox has not reached parity with Busybox.  History  In early 2006 Toybox was started by Rob Landley after he ended his BusyBox maintainership due to a dispute with Bruce Perens, the original creator of BusyBox. In 2008 the project went dormant. At the end of 2011, Tim Bird, a Sony employee suggested to create an alternative to BusyBox which would not be under the GNU General Public License. Rob Landley followed the request and suggested instead to base this library on the dormant Toybox. He re-licensed Toybox from the GNU General Public License to the 2-clause BSD License,Toybox relaunch on toybox.landley.narkive.com (2011-11-20)Switch to 2-clause BSD license (with caveat about scripts directory). 0.2.0 by landley on 15 Nov 2011 and took up the Toybox development again.

Rob Landley, who had started the BusyBox-based lawsuits, responded this was intentional, explaining that the lawsuits had not benefited the project but that they had led to corporate avoidance, expressing a desire to stop the lawsuits \\"in whatever way I see fit\\".

She was the third vessel of the Royal Navy to use the name. Design The Crimean War sparked a sudden need for shallow-draught, manoeuvrable vessels for inshore work in the Baltic and the Black Sea. The Arrow class of six wooden-hulled screw steamers were built during 1854 to a design by the Surveyor‚Äôs Department. Construction was undertaken at two commercial yards on the Thames, R & H Green and C J Mare & Company, both of Leamouth, London. Two further designs of Crimean War gunvessel were ordered during 1855, the Intrepid class and the Vigilant class. The class was built as despatch vessels, but in 1856 were re-designated as second-class gunvessels. =Propulsion= A two-cylinder horizontal single expansion steam engine supplied by Humphrys, Tennant and Dykes provided through a single screw. =Sail plan= All Arrow-class gunvessels were barque-rigged. =Armament= The Arrow class were provided with two 68-pounder Lancaster muzzle-loading rifled guns weighing on pivot mounts, and four 32-pounder guns. =Construction= Beagle was laid down at the Leamouth yard of C J Mare & Company on 15 April 1854 and launched on 20 July the same year. She was commissioned into the Royal Navy two months later on 3 September. Career Beagle took part in the Crimean War from 1854 to 1856. During the Crimean War, two of her ship's company were awarded the Victoria Cross for their actions: Joseph Trewavas was awarded the VC for his actions in the Sea of Azov, and an acting-mate in Beagle, Wiliam Hewett, was awarded the VC for his actions in defending a shore battery. Disposal Beagle was sold to the Satsuma Domain (Ëñ©Êë©Ëó©) of Japan at Hong Kong in 1863 to be used as a training vessel, and was renamed Kenko (‰πæË°å) in 1865. She was broken up in 1889.

It is since 2010 a franchise brand in the portfolio of Global Franchise Group.  History  Great American Cookie Company was founded by future CEO Michael Coles and partner Arthur Karp, who each invested $4,000 to develop a business selling cookies on the strength of a family recipe passed on to Karp by his grandmother. That same year the first store opened in Atlanta's Perimeter Mall. The first store in Perimeter Mall became successful in its first month, and the company first became franchised a year after its opening. By 1985, the company had sales of $100 million per year and was the largest retail cookie chain in the U.S. When Coles sold the firm to Mrs. Fields Famous Brands in 1998, the company had sales of over $100 million.

The probable cause was failure of No. 3 propeller which caused the engine to detach and the aircraft to become uncontrollable.

It forms part of the Yersinia pestis virulence protein factors that also includes all Yops, or Yersinia outer protein, but the name has been kept out of convention. LcrV's main function is not actually known, but it is essential for the production of other Yops. The type III secretion system of Gram-negative bacteria is used to transport virulence factors from the pathogen directly into the host cell and is only triggered when the bacterium comes into close contact with the host. Effector proteins secreted by the type III system do not possess a secretion signal, and are considered unique because of this. Yersinia spp. secrete effector proteins called YopB and YopD that facilitate the spread of other translocated proteins through the type III needle and the host cell cytoplasm. In turn, the transcription of these moieties is thought to be regulated by another gene, lcrV, found on the Yops virulon that encodes the entire type III system. The product of this gene, LcrV protein, also regulates the secretion of YopD through the type III translocon, and itself acts as a protective \\"V\\" antigen for Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague. A homologue of the Y. pestis LcrV protein, PcrV, has been found in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, an opportunistic pathogen. In vivo studies using mice found that immunisation with the protein protected burned animals from infection by P. aeruginosa, and enhanced survival. In addition, it is speculated that PcrV determines the size of the needle pore for type III secreted effectors. LcrV is a multifunctional protein that has been shown to act at the level of secretion control by binding the Ysc inner-gate protein LcrG and to modulate the host immune response by altering cytokine production. LcrV is also necessary for full induction of low-calcium response (LCR) stimulon virulence gene transcription. The polypeptide is encoded on a plasmid and is only present when the surroundings are around 37o Celsius References Further reading *Salyers, Abigail & Whitt, Dixie; Bacterial Pathogenesis: A Molecular Approach, AMS Press *Biological Weapons Defense: Infectious Diseases and Counterbioterrorism, Humana Press Category:Protein families Category:Bacterial proteins ","title":"LcrV"},{"id":"18136209","text":"The Kingsbury Breweries Company was founded in 1847, at which time it was the Kunz & Bleser Brewing Company.

The B-5 was built around a cruciform frame of aluminum tube. Landing wheels were fitted to three points of this cross, and a mast was fitted above its centre to support the rotor hub. The fourth arm of the cross provided a mounting for a large, plywood fin and rudder, reminiscent of that of the Raoul Hafner's Rotachute that had shaped Bensen's thinking about rotor kite design.

It is based on the collectible card game Magi- Nation Duel. Gameplay Magi Nation involves taming dream creatures and using them to fight. Whenever a creature is defeated, the player may receive that creature's animite, a magical stone containing its essence. These can later be used to forge rings which allow the player to summon during the battle. Each Magi may summon up to four dream creatures at a time, and with up to ten rings equipped, ten dream creatures total at their disposal. Magi are able to fight on their own, casting spells or regenerating energy. Plot Magi Nation follows Tony Jones, a timid human teenage boy, who has just recently moved into a new town. Upon meeting the local kids, they coerce him into entering a cave that they themselves are too frightened to enter. Tony explores the cave, and upon picking up a crystal, the cave collapses, and when he awakes from unconsciousness, he finds himself in a new, strange world. In a forest area, he summons a dream creature from the crystal and meets a man named Eidon. He is escorted to the city of Vash Naroom, located in a network of tree canopies and constructed of wood. His basic questions of the nature of this world are explained. Soon after his arrival, a menacing dungeon erupts from the ground in a nearby forest (called Shadow Geysers). In the following events, Tony is mistaken for a prophesied hero named \\"Magus Kyros\\" and, with no other option, he ventures across this new world, searching for the means by which he can return home. Once the threatening Show Geyser appears in the Glade, an area east of Vash Naroom, Tony follows Eidon and Orwin, the elder of Vash Naroom, to inspect the dark structure. Orwin is fatally wounded by the dark powers of the Geyser, and is almost captured by the two bumbling Dark Magi, Zet and Korg. After consulting the somewhat questionable Seer, Tony discovers that the only way to save Orwin, Tony's only hope for returning home, is to find the rare Cloud Frond. Tony travels to an area west of the Naroom Forest known as the Weave, and finds the home of Gia, the wise old woman whom Eidon trains under. She gives Tony the Core Glyph, and is surprised when he is able to hold the artefact without experiencing severe pain. This event leads her to believe that Tony may be the legendary Magus Kyros, who was prophesied to return to Magi Nation in a time of great peril. Tony then sets out to investigate the Naroom Shadow Geyser, which is full of Core Dream Creatures. Tony engages in a duel with Togoth, a Dark Magi who was supposed to protect what he calls the Core Gate, and afterwards escapes the crumbling Geyser with a Core Stone, one of four stones used to activate the Core Glyph and reach the Core. When the Geyser disappears, Tony notices a mysterious hooded figure that quickly disappears into a cave, who we later discover to be Morag, the leader of Agram's Dark Magi. Tony then decides to travel to the Underneath in order to find the last three Core Stones which, according to Gia, should help him to access the Core and return to his home in Tavel Gorge. While in the Naroom Forest, he saves a young man named Wence from an attacking Agovo, who later ends up saving Tony's life. Tony arrives at the Underneath Town and meets several characters, including Gogor, the self-centered \\"hero\\" of the town, Motash, the village elder, and Ulk, the sister of Gruk and a good friend of Wence. Outside of town lies Gruk's mushfarm, where Tony ventures to help her resolve the strange noises coming from her basement. Tony arrives and is unable to save her from being kidnapped by Zet and Korg, who later make ridiculous demands to the Underneath townspeople in exchange for Gruk. Tony and Gogor travel to the abandoned fort, where they help free Gruk from her imprisonment. Not soon after, a Shadow Geyser rises from Gruk's mushfarm, severely hurting her in the process. Motash realizes that Tony is the great Magus Kyros, and implores him to destroy the Geyser and then leave the Underneath. Tony once again picks his way through this Geyser, and after a battle with the Dark Magi Ogar, he receives another Core Stone and destroys the dark tower. However, he arrives back to town to see that the entire place has been destroyed by Morag and his Dark Magi. Morag turns Motash into a snake, and easily defeats Tony when he is approached. Tony is saved at the last moment by Wence, who shoots an arrow at Morag and scares him away. After waking up from his faint in Wence's house, Tony returns to Gia's hut and tells her the terrible news about the Underneath. Suddenly, Morag, Korg, and Zet arrive and kidnap Tony, who is taken to the fiery Cald region. Morag uses another Core Stone to create a third Shadow Geyser, one surrounded by a lake of lava. He retreats before throwing Tony in the lava when a group of Caldlings arrive on the scene. Ashgar, the village elder, and the others accuse Tony of creating the Shadow Geyser. They are interrupted when panicked citizens announce that the town is under attack by Dark Magi. Tony quickly steps in and, with the help of the bridge builder Valkan, defeats the Shadow Magi. The townspeople apologize for accusing Tony, and ask that he quickly dispose of the Geyser. Tony seeks the help of Valkan, who agrees to help build a bridge across the lava so Tony can reach the Geyser. As soon as the bridge is completed, however, it collapses into the lava. The embarrassed Valkan begs that Tony not tell anyone about the incident, in order to preserve his reputation, and tells Tony that he can jump over the lava with Agadon's Boots, which are kept locked up in a Vault in Orothe. After stealing the key to the vault from Ashgar's house, Tony travels aboard a ferry to the island of Orothe. Deep in the caves beneath the island he meets Blu, a lonely pirate who guards the vault. Tony unlocks the vault and retrieves the Boots, and also receives a horn from Blu in thanks for relieving him of his post as the vault guard. Blu tells Tony that if he is ever in danger, he can use to horn to call for help. Tony then returns to the Cald Shadow Geyser and, using the boots, jumps over the lava and enters the tower. Tony defeats the Shadow Magi Korremar and receives the third Core Stone. In celebration of the destruction of the Shadow Geyser, the Caldlings hold a party for Tony. During a play about the heroism of Tony Jones, Morag appears and kidnaps Tony. Depending on how the player responds to the scenario, Morag may or may not kill two girls that Tony knows. Either way, Tony is taken to Shadowhold. In the Shadowhold, Tony is placed in a cell as a prisoner. With assistance from an unknown aid, Tony is able to escape his cell in the Shadowhold, but finds himself cornered by Shadow Magi at the edge of the Shadowhold, next to the sea. Unable to swim, but desperate, Tony blows the horn Blu had given to him earlier and dives off of the edge of the fortress. Blu conveniently arrives and gives Tony a belt that allows him to swim and breath underwater, before leading him to Orothe, which is actually an undersea city resting on giant turtles. Tony learns that a Shadow Geyser has appeared in Orothe, and all attempts to enter it have failed due to a barrier. Fearing for their safety, the denizens of the city have nearly all moved to calmer waters. Tony searches nearby ruins and learns a new spell that allows him to disable the barrier and enter the Shadow Geyser as the remaining Orotheans leave the area. Tony enters the Shadow Geyser and confronts Warrada, the Shadow Magi guardian of the geyser. Warrada offers to give Tony the Core Stone if he would simply stay out of their way. Regardless of Tony's choice, Tony obtains the Core Stone and returns to Gia, who has fled to Vash Naroom after her home was destroyed. Gia explains that Tony is not the Great Magus Kyros, and that his mere presence in the realm has allowed an ancient enemy of the Magi, Agram, to return. Tony agrees to leave after sorrowful urging from Gia, and heads to the Core Gate near the remains of Gia's old home. After activating the Core Glyph, Tony appears to return home, but is actually ambushed by Korg and Zet. Tony engages and defeats both Korg and Zet, before winged beings descend and tell Tony that a Shadow Geyser has appeared in Arderial, their home territory that sits atop the clouds, and that Shadow Magi are terrorizing everyone. Wondering how another geyser appeared, Tony agrees to meet with the Arderial queen, Jaela. Tony meets with Jaela, but the conversation is interrupted by the appearance of Morag, who has a small scuffle with the queen before Agram appears himself and causes Jaela to vanish. Agram attempts to explain himself to Tony, who angrily vows that he will stop Agram no matter what. Intrigued, Agram tells Tony that if he can defeated Morag in the Arderial Shadow Geyser, Agram will be waiting in the Core for Tony. Tony enters the Shadow Geyser and defeats Morag, gaining a fifth Core Stone. Tony heads back to the Core, seeing hundreds of petrified people, including those he has met along his journey, along the way. Tony confronts Agram and, after an intense battle, defeats him. After Agram's defeat, the petrified people are returned to normal, and Jaela tells Tony that he may step into the light in Agram's throne room to return home. Tony returns home and is accepted by the group that sent him into the cave. Back in Magi Nation, a funeral is held for Orwin in Vash Naroom (or a party, if Orwin is saved during the game). It is optional to refuse to step into the light by trying to leave the throne room, in which case Tony can attend the funeral (or party).

Little Jack is born on the coldest day ever, which causes his heart to be frozen solid, requiring a replacement. The makeshift Doctor, Madeleine, who provides midwifery and medical services to the poor and the desperate of Edinburgh, grafts a cuckoo clock to his heart of flesh and blood in order to save it. Due to Madeleine's \\"clientele\\" the children that she delivers are sometimes unwanted, and so she puts them up for adoption to good parents. Unfortunately, nobody wants Jack because of his strange clock heart, and so he ends up living with Madeleine as his adoptive mother. She tells Jack that his clock heart is weak and so to avoid premature death, he must obey three golden rules: Never touch the hands of the clock, control his anger, and never fall in love. Life is relatively happy and carefree for a while as Jack lives with Madeleine in her surgery/workshop and is befriended by two 'working girls' named Anna and Luna. However, one day, he does fall in love; With a street singer named Miss Acacia, who takes a liking to him. Against Madeleine's initial wishes Jack demands that he be enrolled in the local school in order to receive an education, but his real motive is to look for, and hopefully be reunited with, Miss Acacia. At the school Jack doesn't find her but he does come across Joe, who becomes Jack's tormentor. Joe bullies him relentlessly until one day Jack accidentally strikes Joe in the eye with his clock, blinding him. Jack escapes the authorities and decides to travel all the way to Andalusia, where he's heard that Miss Acacia was now living. Whilst on this journey he encounters 'Jack the ripper' on a train and is nearly killed by him, only just escaping. Eventually he arrives in Paris and looks for someone who can properly readjust his clock heart. He meets a mechanically-minded filmmaker named Georges M√©li√®s, who performs the repairs and decides to travel to Andalusia with Jack for the attempt to reunite Jack with Miss Acacia. Upon eventually arriving in Andalusia Jack finds Miss Acacia, who is now singing on stage in an amusement park, while Jack gains employment as a 'scarer' on the ghost train. He is not particularly successful at scaring people but becomes very popular as a figure of benevolent amusement. Life is very good for Jack for a while, as his romance with Miss Acacia blossoms and they become closer. During this time Jack is communicating with Madeleine, Anna and Luna in Edinburgh by means of a homing pigeon, and it is in one of these messages that he learns that Madeleine has died. One day Joe appears at the park. He tells Jack that he is in love with Miss Acacia and that's why he bullied Jack at school. Furthermore, Joe reveals that he has come to Andalusia to reclaim her. Joe immediately takes Jack's job as the ghost train 'scarer' as the owner sees Joe as being far more convincing in the role than Jack. Joe then starts the process of trying to reclaim Miss Acacia and reveals to her that Jack was responsible for the injury to his eye. Miss Acacia confronts Jack with this and a heated argument breaks out between the two of them. Miss Acacia accusing Jack of being a dishonest scoundrel and Jack claiming that she neither understands him nor fully comprehends how much he loves her. In a mixture of anger, frustration, and fear of losing Miss Acacia, Jack attempts to tear out his clock heart with his bare hands. He breaks the hands of the clock and feels an intense pain. There is also a rivulet of blood from his chest as he passes out. Jack wakes up some time later in a bed with the figure of a woman beside him. His broken clock heart is on the bedside table and Jack's chest contains a new, more modern and quieter, clock heart that M√©li√®s has installed to replace the broken one. Jack learns that three years have passed since he broke his original clock and slipped in to a coma. M√©li√®s has returned to Paris and the woman by Jack's bed is one of M√©li√®s' past lovers who decided to stay and look after Jack whilst he was unconscious. Furthermore, she reveals that M√©li√®s has written a book about Jack and their adventures together. Unfortunately, this book contains a very disturbing claim. M√©li√®s states that Jack's clock heart was entirely unnecessary and the fact that Jack thought it was required for his survival provided a curious fascination for M√©li√®s. This news is initially incomprehensible and disturbing to Jack as he is torn between his disbelief at this and his knowledge of M√©li√®s to be honest and trustworthy. Jack's confusion and self-doubt are soon short-lived, however, as he slowly regains his memories and begins thinking again of Miss Acacia. Jack discovers that the three years he spent in a coma have transformed him from a teenager in to a young man. He has grown taller, his features have become more rugged and he now has a beard. He barely recognizes himself in the mirror and decides to use this as a means to subtly reacquaint himself with Miss Acacia. He dresses himself in one of M√©li√®s' old suits and a hat and goes back to the amusement park, where he finds that Miss Acacia is still singing on the stage and Joe is still working on the ghost train. He also discovers that he has a grave and that everyone thinks he died the night he tried to tear out his heart. As he is no longer recognizable as his previous self Jack is able to develop a new friendship with Miss Acacia and they even begin lightly flirting with each other. After several weeks Jack decides that he's going to reveal his true self to Miss Acacia and take her back from Joe. As part of this plan he decides to make her a present of his old broken clock heart, and wraps it up in a box. Upon their meeting Miss Acacia sees the box and is very hesitant. She explains that she can't accept a present from him because she's already in love and cannot be with anyone else. Jack is downcast and replies that he knows that she is in love with Joe, to which Miss Acacia says that it's not Joe that she is in love with but a former lover called Jack who died three years ago. With a feeling of confusion and elation Jack hands her the box and asks her to take it and open it anyway. When she sees the clock Jack expects her to be joyous at their reunion but instead, at finally realizing who he is, she regards him with a cold anger and tells Jack that because of him she has married a man she does not love (Joe) and that she has put flowers on his grave every day for three years. She tells Jack that as far as she is concerned he no longer exists. She looks through him without emotion and walks away. The book ends with Jack realizing that he has lost Miss Acacia forever. In the epilogue it is told that Jack becomes a mere phantom of his previous self as he lives with the pain of having lost Miss Acacia for good. He travels back to Edinburgh and finally learns the truth of his clock heart from Anna and Luna. Madeleine had deliberately grafted the clock to his chest as a means of keeping him close to her, knowing that no adoptive parents would want such a strange boy and hoping that his belief that his heart could not tolerate love and anger would keep him with Madeleine and protect him from the harsh realities of life.

Differences between the film and book In the novel version, Jack appears to be a grown adult. In the film version, he appears to be 14 years old after his three gloomy birthdays and bullying at school in an attempt to get a better P.O.V of the three rules in the near future and see Acacia again. In the novel version, Acacia never grows rose thorns around her arms. In the film version, Jack dies from kissing Acacia. In the novel version, Jack gains a fully formed real heart after a kiss from Acacia, only to lose her afterward. In the film version, M√©li√®s has a bigger role in being a supportive friend for Jack, and does not write terrible things about him in his book. In the novel version, Madeleine doesn't fully remove Jack's heart. The clock is just here to help it beat. In the film version, Madeleine totally replaces Jack's heart with the clock Film adaptation Luc Besson has optioned the story to be made into an animated feature film that Malzieu would co-direct.

Baker, 554 U.S. 471 (2008), was a case decided by the Supreme Court of the United States. The Court ruled in a 5-3 decision that the punitive damages awarded to the victims of the Exxon Valdez oil spill should be reduced from US$2.5 billion to US$500 million. The case was appealed from the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Ninth Circuit had also ruled that Exxon could be held liable for the reckless conduct of the ship's captain, Joseph J. Hazelwood, who had left the bridge during the disaster and had been drinking vodka that evening. The Supreme Court was split 4‚Äì4 on the question of whether Exxon was liable for Hazelwood's action. The result of the split is that the Ninth Circuit's ruling on Exxon's respondeat superior liability for Hazelwood's conduct remains since Hazelwood acted in a managerial capacity under the Restatement (Second) of Torts Section 909(c) approach to punitive damages. After considering the punitive damage policies of foreign nations, the Court reasoned that although punitive damages were warranted, they may not exceed what Exxon already paid to compensate victims for economic losses, which was about US$500 million. It held that a one-to-one ratio between punitive and compensatory damages was \\"a fair upper limit\\" in maritime cases that involved recklessness, compared to the lower liability of negligence or the higher liability of intentional conduct. Its reasoning, \\"The real problem, it seems, is the stark unpredictability of punitive awards,\\" frustrates the goal of punitive damages, deterring reprehensible conduct, because predictable damages create an incentive to continue dangerous misconduct if the personal injury liability is less than the potential profit, as on the Ford Pinto. It suggested giving a \\"bad man\\" the chance to look ahead and to calculate the consequences of doing or not doing a bad act will deter harmful actions. He suggests the upper limits on punitive damages should be as predictable as the legislative range of criminal sentences, but no minimum for punitive damages were discussed. Justice David Souter wrote for the majority, joined in full by Chief Justice John Roberts and Justices Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, and Clarence Thomas. Justice Samuel Alito took no part in the decision because he owns stock in ExxonMobil. Justice Stevens wrote a separate opinion concurring in part and dissenting in part. His dissent advocated judicial restraint because Congress has chosen to regulate maritime tort law. Stevens wrote that the trial court award of $2.5 billion in punitive damages was not an abuse of discretion and should have been affirmed. Of this reasoning, Boston University law professor Keith Hylton said, \\"The court's elaborate and lengthy argument for the one-to-one ratio is troubling for several reasons. First, the whole discussion was largely unnecessary if the court really wanted to limit its decision to maritime cases. The court's majority appears to be trying to make the case for imposing the one-to-one ratio as a default rule in ordinary civil cases.\\"  References  Further reading * External links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:2008 in Alaska Category:2008 in the environment Category:Exxon Valdez oil spill Category:ExxonMobil litigation Category:United States admiralty case law Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Roberts Court Category:Ships of ExxonMobil Category:Recklessness (law) ","title":"Exxon Shipping Co. v.

It was the home of the Ottawa Hockey Club from 1908 to 1923. It was the third in a series of ice hockey venues built by the Dey family of Ottawa. At the time of its building, it was Canada's largest arena. History The arena was built in 1907 and was built because audiences for hockey matches had out-grown the previous arena, known as Dey's Rink or Dey's Arena. The spectator capacity was 7,000, of which 2,500 was standing room. 'The Arena', as it was called, was built on leased land at Laurier Avenue at the Rideau Canal, on the location of today's Confederation Park, near the current Ottawa city hall. This is very close to the location of the first Dey's Rink, which was located on the opposite bank of the Canal. It is also close to the location of the Royal Rink at 28 Slater, which was where the Ottawa Hockey Club first practised in 1883. The land for The Arena was leased from landowner Esther Sherwood for the rate of per month, for twenty years.Kitchen(1993), p. 10 The Arena opened on January 11, 1908 for a game between Ottawa and the Montreal Wanderers, the top rivalry of the day. The last Senators game at the arena was held on March 10, 1923, after which the team moved to the Ottawa Auditorium. The Ottawa Auditorium was also built by the Deys, who were part owners of the Ottawa Senators. This third rink was torn down by the federal government at the end of the lease in 1927 to make way for the ceremonial 'Driveway' improvement project along the Rideau Canal. The Arena hosted the 1910 and 1911 Stanley Cup challenges, and the 1920 Stanley Cup Finals, all won by the Ottawa Senators. (The 1921 and 1923 Ottawa Stanley Cup wins were won out west.) The Arena was used for other sports as well as ice hockey. The 1912 Canadian Figure Skating Championships were held in February 1912 at the Arena. Boxing matches were held there including Canadian heavyweight champion Tommy Burns versus Len Darcy, and Canadian lightweight champion Bobby Ebber versus Homer LeBlanc on October 16, 1925. The matches drew over two thousand fans. Building The Arena was a large improvement internally from the previous Dey Arena. The dressing rooms, rest rooms, smoking rooms and lobby were steam-heated. The main doors were on Laurier Avenue, and a north entrance existed onto Slater Street, which at the time extended to the Canal.Kitchen(1993), pg. 9 The exterior was simple, and did not meet Sherwood's lease criteria of a 'worthy architectural feature' of Ottawa. At its building, it was the largest ice arena in Canada.Kitchen(1993), pg. 8 File:The Arena, Ottawa, View One.jpgInterior of The Arena, c. 1920 File:The Arena, Ottawa, View Two.jpgInterior of The Arena, c. 1920 File:Ottawa-Arena-Plan-1907.jpgPlan of The Arena, c. 1907 File:OttawaAerial2.JPGAerial view of downtown Ottawa, c. 1920.

IMMH, International Maritime Museum) is a private museum in the HafenCity quarter of Hamburg, Germany. The museum houses Peter Tamm's collection of model ships, construction plans, uniforms, and maritime art, amounting to over 40,000 items and more than one million photographs. It opened in a former warehouse in 2008. History Peter Tamm The first model ship The private collection was started in 1934 by Peter Tamm--former chairman of the board of the Axel Springer AG--when Tamm was six years old. As Tamm retold the history, the initial event was when his mother presented him his first model ship. Prior to the opening in the HafenCity, the collection was called \\"Wissenschaftliches Institut f√ºr Schifffahrts- und Marinegeschichte\\" (Academic Institute of Shipping and Naval History) and located in a mansion at the Elbchaussee street and only open by appointment. In 2004 the Hamburg Parliament approved a grant for a new museum in the HafenCity quarter unanimously, with an abstention from voting by the GAL party parliamentary group. On 25 June 2008, the museum was opened by the German president Horst K√∂hler. Architecture The Kaispeicher B (quay warehouse B) is the oldest preserved warehouse in Hamburg, built in 1878 and 1879 by the architects Bernhard Georg Jacob Hanssen and Wilhelm Emil Meerwein. It was built with a supporting structure of wood and steel columns, the outer walls of bricks also supporting the building. It was designed in neo-Gothic style. Constructed and used as a combination of a grain elevator and for ground storage for packaged goods. In 1890 the city of Hamburg bought the warehouse, which has been called Kaispeicher B ever since. In 2000 it was listed as a cultural heritage building but used as a warehouse for goods until the end of 2003. In 2008 the museum was opened after a period of renovation. Mirjana Marcovic (MRLV Architekten) planned the renovations and received an award from the Architekten- und Ingenieurverein Hamburg. The bridge crossing the Brocktorhafen--a steel construction of in the shape of a boomerang with a length of --by architect Dietmar Feichtinger (Paris) and WTM Engineers (Hamburg) also received an award in 2008. Interior and contents Renovated interior of the museum before the opening in 2008 The collection contains predominantly samples from the private collection of Peter Tamm and was severely criticised in the media for the lack of distance and historical awareness toward the German U-Boat war, the German sea war during World War II, and German colonial history. Some critics changed their opinion later. The walkabout starts with a 3,000-year-old dugout, which was found in the Elbe river. Another exhibit is the baton of Gro√üadmiral Karl D√∂nitz (1891-1945), displayed in an article about the Nuremberg Trials in the newspaper Berliner Zeitung of 1946. This article describes the sentences against the Nazi war criminals. The exhibition of the baton was often taken as an example of the lack of historical awareness about Nazi propaganda and the lack of distance toward Nazi symbolism, without challenging it. Further the exhibition consists of paintings with a naval or marine theme, model ships made of whale bones or ivory, weapons, uniforms, and decorations. Also the reproduction of the James Caird, the small lifeboat of Sir Ernest Shackleton's Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition, used by the German explorer Arved Fuchs in a relived journey in 2000, is displayed. The museum's archive also possesses 47 original letters of Lord Horatio Nelson, famous for his victory at the Battle of Trafalgar, and 15,000 cruise ship menus.

In Japanese mythology, the sibling progenitors Izanagi and Izanami gave birth to the islands and gods of Japan. After Izanami died from burns during the childbirth of the fire deity Kagu-tsuchi, Izanagi was enraged and killed his son. Kagutsuchi's blood or body, according to differing versions of the legend, created several other deities, including Kuraokami. Name The name Kuraokami combines kura Èóá \\"dark; darkness; closed\\" and okami Èæó \\"dragon tutelary of water\\". This uncommon kanji (o)kami or rei Èæó, borrowed from the Chinese character ling Èæó \\"rain-dragon; mysterious\\" (written with the \\"rain\\" radical Èõ®, 3 Âè£ \\"mouths\\", and a phonetic of long Èæç \\"dragon\\") is a variant Chinese character for Japanese rei < Chinese ling Èùà \\"rain-prayer; supernatural; spiritual\\" (with 2 Â∑´ \\"shamans\\" instead of a \\"dragon\\"). Compare this 33-stroke Èæó logograph with the simpler 24-stroke variant Èùá (\\"rain\\" and \\"dragon\\" without the \\"mouths\\"), read either rei < ling Èùá \\"rain prayer; supernatural\\" or ry≈ç < long Èùá \\"sound of thunder\\", when used for ryo < long ÈöÜ reduplicated in ry≈çry≈ç < longlong ÈöÜÈöÜ \\"rumble; boom\\". Marinus Willem de Visser (1913:136) cites the 713 CE Bungo Fudoki Ë±äÂæåÈ¢®ÂúüË®ò that okami is written ËõáÈæç \\"snake dragon\\" in a context about legendary Emperor Keik≈ç seeing an okami dragon in a well, and concludes, \\"This and later ideas about Kura-okami show that this divinity is a dragon or snake.\\" Grafton Elliot Smith provides a Trans-cultural diffusionist perspective. > The snake takes a more obtrusive part in the Japanese than in the Chinese > dragon and it frequently manifests itself as a god of the sea. The old > Japanese sea-gods were often female water-snakes. The cultural influences > which reached Japan from the south by way of Indonesia ‚Äî many centuries > before the coming of Buddhism ‚Äî naturally emphasized the serpent form of the > dragon and its connexion with the ocean. (1919:101)  Lineage  In the Kojiki, he is the father of female deity Hikawa-hime (Êó•Ê≤≥ÊØîÂ£≤, or Hikaha-hime) married Susanoo's grandson, the male deity Fuwanomojikunusunu (Â∏ÉÊ≥¢ËÉΩÊØçÈÅÖ‰πÖÂ•¥È†àÂ•¥Á•û, or Fuhanomojikunusunu) and from their union gave birth to the male deity Fukafuchi-no-Mizuyarehana (Ê∑±Ê∑µ‰πãÊ∞¥Â§úÁ§ºËä±Á•û). Fukafuchi- no-Mizuyarehana is the great-grandfather of the male deity ≈åkuninushi (Â§ßÂõΩ‰∏ªÁ•û). Then, the great-grandson of ≈åkuninushi, Mikanushi-hiko (Áîï‰∏ªÊó•Â≠êÁ•û) married Hinarashi-hime (ÊØîÈÇ£ËâØÂøóÊØòÂ£≤), who is the daughter of Okami, sister of Hikawa-hime. From the union of Mikanushi-hiko and Hinarashi-hime gave birth to the male deity Tahirikishimarumi (Â§öÊØîÁêÜÂ≤êÂøóÈ∫ªÊµÅÁæéÁ•û). Kojiki The ca. 680 CE Kojiki transcribes Kuraokami Kami with man'y≈çgana as ÈóáÊ∑§Âä†Áæé \\"dark o-ka-mi god\\". In the Kojiki version of this myth, Izanagi killed Kagutsuchi with his giant sword, and the blood subsequently created eight kami \\"gods; spirits\\". The final two generated from blood that dripped off the hilt onto Izanagi's fingers were Kuraokami and Kuramitsuha Kami ÈóáÂæ°Ê¥•ÁæΩÁ•û \\"dark mi-tsu-ha god\\". > Then His Augustness the Male-Who-invites, drawing the ten-grasp sabre that > was augustly girded on him, cut off the head of his child the Deity Shining- > Elder. Hereupon the names of the Deities that were born from the blood that > stuck to the point of the august sword and bespattered the multitudinous > rock-misses were: the Deity Rock-Splitter, next the Deity Root-Splitter, > next the Rock-Possessing-Male-Deity. The names of the Deities that were next > born from the blood that stuck to the upper part of the august sword and > again bespattered the multitudinous rock-masses were: the Awfully-Swift- > Deity, next the Fire-Swift-Deity, next the Brave-Awful-Possessing-Male- > Deity, another name for whom is the Brave-Snapping-Deity, and another name > is the Luxuriant-Snapping Deity. The names of the Deities that were next > born from the blood that collected on the hilt of the august sword and > leaked out between his fingers were: the Deity Kura-okami and next the Deity > Kura-mitsuha. All the eight Deities in the above list, from the Deity Rock- > Splitter to the Deity Kura-mitsuha, are Deities that were born from the > august sword. (tr. Chamberlain 1919:36) Basil Hall Chamberlain notes, \\"The etymology of both these name is obscure. Kura, the first element of each compound, signifies \\"dark\\".\\" Another Kojiki section listing ancestors of ≈åkuninushi Â§ßÂõΩ‰∏ª \\"great country master\\" says Okami Kami's daughter Hikaha Hime Êó•Ê≤≥ÊØîÂ£≤ \\"sun river princess\\" had a daughter Fukabuchi no mizu Yarehana Ê∑±Ê∑µ‰πãÊ∞¥Â§úÁ§ºËä± \\"deep pool water lost flower\\". > The Deity Fuha-no-moji-Ku-nu-su-nu ‚Ä¶ wedded Princess Hikaha, daughter of the > Deity Okami, and begot a child: Water-Spoilt-Blossom-of-Fuka-buchi.

Chamberlain 1919:78-9) Nihongi The ca. 720 CE Nihon Shoki writes Kuraokami with kanji as ÈóáÈæó \\"dark rain-dragon\\". In the Nihongi version, Izanagi killed Kagutsuchi by cutting him into three pieces, each of which became a god: Kuraokami, Kurayamatsumi ÈóáÂ±±Á•á \\"dark mountain respect\\", and Kuramitsuha ÈóáÁΩîË±° \\"dark water-sprit\\". This mitsuha ÁΩîË±° is a variant of m≈çry≈ç È≠çÈ≠é \\"demon; evil spirit\\" (written with the \\"ghost radical\\" È¨º). Kurayamatsumi is alternately written Takaokami È´òÈùá \\"high rain- dragon\\". Visser (1913:136) says, \\"This name is explained by one of the commentators as \\"the dragon-god residing on the mountains\\", in distinction from Kura-okami, \\"the dragon-god of the valleys\\". > At length he drew the ten-span sword with which he was girt, and cut Kagu > tsuchi into three pieces, each of which became changed into a God. Moreover, > the blood which dripped from the edge of the sword became the multitudinous > rocks which are in the bed of the Easy-River of Heaven. This God was the > father of Futsu-nushi no Kami. Moreover, the blood which dripped from the > hilt-ring of the sword spurted out and became deities, whose names were Mika > no Haya-hi no Kami and next Hi no Haya-hi no Kami. This Mika no Haya-hi no > Kami was the parent of Take-mika-suchi no Kami. > Another version is: \\"Mika no haya-hi no Mikoto, next Hi no haya-hi no > Mikoto, and next Take-mika-tsuchi no Kami.

Moreover, the blood which dripped from the head of the sword spurted > out and became deities, who were called Kura o Kami no Kami, next Kura- > yamatsumi no Kami, and next Kura-midzu-ha no Kami. (tr. Aston 1896:23) William George Aston (1896:24) footnotes translations for these kami names: Kuraokami \\"Dark-god\\", Kurayamatsumi \\"Dark-mountain-body-god\\", and Kuramitsuha \\"Dark-water-goddess\\". De Visser (1913:136‚Äì137) says Kuramitsuha could be translated \\"Dark-water-snake\\", \\"Valley-water-snake\\", or \\"Female-water-snake\\". Man'y≈çsh≈´ The Man'y≈çsh≈´ poetry collection mentions an Okami ÊñºÂèØÁæé \\"rain dragon\\" living on an oka Â≤° \\"ridge; knoll; hill\\". Lady Fujiwara, a daughter of Fujiwara no Kamatari, replies to a poem from her husband Emperor Tenmu () about an unseasonable snowstorm. > It was by speaking > To the dragon of my hill > I caused this snowfall; > A few flakes may have scattered. > No doubt, out there where you are. (2:104, tr. Cranston 1993:490) Compare Edwin Cranston's translation with that of Burton Watson (1986:22), \\"I told the water god on my hill to let the snow fall. It scattered, and some must have fallen over your way!\\" Okami shrines The diverse Japanese kami of water and rainfall, such as Suijin Ê∞¥Á•û \\"water god\\" and Okami, are worshipped at Shinto shrines, especially during times of drought. For instance, Niukawakami Jinja ‰∏πÁîüÂ∑ù‰∏äÁ•ûÁ§æ in Kawakami, Nara is a center of prayers for Kuraokami, Takaokami, and Mizuhanome ÁΩîË±°Â•≥. Some other examples of shrines to Okami are: *Okami Jinja () in Dait≈ç, Osaka *Okami Jinja () in Minamiaizu, Fukushima *Okami Jinja () in Hirakata and Izumisano, Osaka *Kuraokami Jinja () in Ichikai, Tochigi *Takaokami Jinja () on Mount Miwa *Takaokami Jinja () in Sh≈çbara, Hiroshima *Kunitsu Okami Jinja () on Iki Island In addition, the water-god Takaokami is worshipped at various shrines named Kibune Jinja (), found in places such as Saky≈ç-ku, Kyoto and Manazuru, Kanagawa.

Newcastle upon Tyne Chares and much of the layout of Newcastle's Quayside date from medieval times. At one point, there were 20 chares in Newcastle. After the great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead in 1854, a number of the chares were permanently removed although many remain in existence today. Chares also are still present in the higher parts of the city centre. According to \\"Quayside and the Chares\\" published by City of Newcastle upon Tyne Education and Libraries Directorate, 2002 by Jack and John Leslie, chares reflected their name or residents. \\"Names might change over the years, including Armourer's Chare which become Colvin's Chare\\". Originally inhabited by wealthy merchants, the chares became slums as they were deserted due to their \\"dark, cramped conditions\\". The chares were infamous for their insanitary conditions - typhus was \\"epidemic\\" and there were three cholera outbreaks in 1831-2, 1848-9 and finally in 1853 (which killed over 1,500 people). =Chares destroyed by the Great Fire= A number of chares were destroyed beyond repair as a result of the fire and are no longer extant. The chares that were not rebuilt were replaced by Queen Street, King Street and Lombard Street. Hornsby's Chare, formerly named Maryon House Chare, Colvin's Chare, formerly Black Boy's Chare, Pallister's Chare, formerly Armourer's Chare, Blue Anchor Chare, also known as Blew Anchor Chare, Peppercorn Chare and Grinding Chare, also known as Grandon/Grandin Chare were destroyed and no longer exist.Eneas Mackenzie's \\"Historical Account of Newcastle-upon-Tyne\\", pp160-182, published 1827 Dark Chare, the first of the alleys by Sandhill and described by in 1827 by Eneas Mackenzie, was also destroyed. He said of Dark Chare that \\"a stout person would find it rather inconvenient to press through the upper part of this lane. It is very properly termed the Dark Chare, for the houses at the top nearly touch each other. It is not now used as a thoroughfare. It has been justly observed, that the ground occupied by these chares is the most crowded with buildings of any part in his majesty's dominions.\\" =Still in existence= On the Quayside, there are a large number of chares still in existence. Many of them are now just narrow alleyways and routes although some of them have been widened and their uses have been extended because of it: * Breakneck Stairs - still exist as stairs between Close and Hanover Street. They now form part of a city-centre flats development based upon the extant Bonded Warehouse development. * Tuthill Stairs - recently upgraded and extant. It was recently rebuilt and modernised as part of the Quayside Lofts project. * Long Stairs - lead up to the Moot Hall and start between the 15th century Cooperage and 16th century \\"Buttress\\" merchant's house. * Castle Stairs - runs up from the end of Close and start of Sandhill to the Black Gate and Castle Keephttp://twsitelines.info/SMR/6572 * Plummer Chare - according to Eneas Mackenzie, \\"the receptacle of Cyprian nymphs, whose blandishments were of the most coarse and vulgar description. Indeed, most of these dark lanes were inhabited by \\"very dangerous, though not very tempting females.\\" Now, the chare exists as a narrow alley between King Street and Fenwick's Entry. * Fenwick's Entry, formerly called Kirk Chare - now a main entrance to the modern development behind Quayside. In its original incarnation before the fire, \\"Cuthbert Fenwick, Esq. alderman, who resided in the upper part of the chare; for, however confined, dirty, and disagreeable these alleys may now seem, they formerly contained some of the best houses in the town, and were inhabited by opulent merchants, particularly those engaged in the coal-trade.\\" * Broad Garth - was one of the main chares behind Quayside and is now a residential street name in the modern 1980s development. Until the great fire, its use had shifted from residential to warehousing usage. * Trinity Chare, formerly called Dalton's Place \\\\- a narrow alley leading to the Live Theatre rehearsal rooms and a number of almshouses dating from the 18th century. * Cox Chare - formerly known as Coxton's Chare or Cockis Chare, now a road leading from Pandon to Quayside, and was previously much narrower and surrounded by warehouses * Love Lane - previously called Gowerley's Rawe, was replaced by warehouses which were eventually converted to apartments Geoff Phillip's \\"Newcastle: Now and Then\\", p53, published 1997 by GP Electronic Services * Milk Market - now the side of the conversion into apartments of the warehouses of Jonhson, Dodds and Company Limited.Geoff Phillip's \\"Newcastle: Now and Then\\", p52, published 1997 by GP Electronic Services Other than on the riverside, there are a number of chares in existence in the higher parts of the city: * Pudding Chare - runs from Bigg Market to Neville Street and contains some off-street examples of the medieval city. * Denton Chare - formerly known as the Iron Market, connects St Nicholas Street to Neville Street. * Pink Lane - a very narrow alley stretching Clayton Street West and Westgate Road. It is best known for containing the excavated foundations of Gunner Tower, part of the ancient Newcastle town wall. Other chares on the Quayside that remains are Wrangham's Entry, Spencer's Entry, the Swirle, Flag Chare and Anchor Chare.

A sub-district of the city's Gentilly District, its boundaries as defined by the City Planning Commission are: Lake Pontchartrain to the north; the Industrial Canal to the east; Leon C. Simon Drive, Elysian Fields Avenue, New York Street, the London Avenue Canal, and Robert E. Lee Boulevard to the south; and Bayou St. John to the west. The neighborhood comprises the Lake Terrace and Lake Oaks subdivisions, the principal campus of the University of New Orleans, and the University of New Orleans Research & Technology Park -- all built on land reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain. The Lakefront (or lakefront) is a term sometimes used for the larger neighborhood created by the Orleans Levee Board's land-reclamation initiative in early 20th-century New Orleans. It includes Lake Terrace and Lake Oaks, as well as Lakeshore Drive, the lakefront park system, the University of New Orleans, Lake Vista, and Lakeshore. It is considered one of the wealthier areas of the city. History This was the original location of Milneburg, whose historic name has been revived by a modern neighborhood somewhat farther south. Land was reclaimed from Lake Pontchartrain in an Orleans Levee Board project which began in the 1920s and was completed in the 1930s, creating the space now occupied by the neighborhood. The Pontchartrain Beach amusement park, originally opened within the present-day Lake Terrace subdivision in the 1920s, moved to newly reclaimed land at the foot of Elysian Fields Avenue in the 1930s and remained a popular attraction through the early 1980s. Lake Oaks Park is located in the neighborhood. During World War II, the area included important war-effort facilities such as Higgins Industries shipyards, Camp Leroy Johnson, and a Naval air base called NAS New Orleans. NAS New Orleans later moved across the Mississippi River to Belle Chasse, and the site of the former naval air station was developed into the principal campus of the University of New Orleans. After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, while some homes and businesses flooded (especially those on and near Robert E. Lee Boulevard/Leon C. Simon Drive) the majority of the section - like the majority of the lakefront - escaped the disastrous post-Katrina flooding, by virtue of the higher elevation of this man-made land. After Katrina, the lakefront appeared as a slender, curiously undamaged, and almost wholly recovered zone adjacent to the much-lower-lying and hard-hit Lakeview and Gentilly neighborhoods on the other side of Robert E. Lee Boulevard/Leon C. Simon Drive. Geography Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks is located at and has an elevation of . According to the United States Census Bureau, the district has a total area of . of which is land and (91.73%) of which is water. Though Lake Terrace, Lake Oaks, and the other Lakefront neighborhoods of Lake Vista and Lakeshore contain numerous fine examples of mid-20th-century modernism, no local or national historic district has been established to bring attention to this unique architectural inventory, or to the noteworthy overall design of New Orleans' Lakefront neighborhood. Lacking local historic district designation to protect the existing built environment from unwarranted demolitions, the mid-20th-century architectural fabric of the Lakefront is being slowly eroded as existing residential structures are torn down to accommodate new construction. A large traffic circle that meets Paris Ave. East and West Lakeshore Drive, was built shortly after construction of the Lake Terrace. An iconic fountain from 1953 remains in the center of the grassy park intersection. The fountain, a piece of mid-century-modernism has sharp corners that expel up from a large plate-like edge. The fountain remained operational until hurricane Katrina in August 2005. Little was done to repair the fountain, even though reports of mosquito infestations and vandalism surfaced. In particular two unnamed teenagers were taken into custody for a short period for trespassing into the operator's box in 2016. They were released with only a warning the same day. Eventually, in November 2018, the city of New Orleans hired a private company on a contract to repair the fountain. The fountain and the park now receive monthly tendance and repair. =Adjacent neighborhoods= * Pontchartrain Park (south) * Milneburg (south) * St. Anthony (south) * Dillard (south) * Lakeshore/Lake Vista (west) =Boundaries= The City Planning Commission defines the boundaries of Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks as these streets: Lake Pontchartrain, the Industrial Canal, Leon C.

It is bordered by Beit Iksa to the east, Beit Ijza to the north, Al Qubeiba to the west, and Beit Surik to the south.

Many also have liver disease and abnormalities of the immune system. The associated malabsorption leads to malnutrition and failure to thrive. It is thought to be a genetic disorder with an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, although responsible genes have not been found and the exact cause remains unknown. Prognosis is poor; many patients die before the age of 5 (mainly from infections or cirrhosis), although most patients nowadays survive with intravenous feeding (parenteral nutrition). Symptoms Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome is one particular form of intractable diarrhea of infancy, presenting typically in the first month of life. These babies were usually born small for their age and continue to experience failure to thrive, usually with a final short stature. Typical facial features include prominent forehead and cheeks, a broad nasal root and widely spaced eyes (hypertelorism). Their hairs are woolly, easily removed and poorly pigmented. Liver disease is mainly present as cirrhosis or fibrosis, and staining might reveal high iron content of the liver cells (consistent with hemochromatosis). Most evaluated patients had some degree of decrease in intelligence.  Genetics  The syndrome appears to be due to mutations in the gene tetratricopeptide repeat domain 37 (TTC37) which encodes the protein Thespin or the SKIV2L gene. This gene is expressed is in the adrenal gland, amniotic fluid, bladder, blood, bone, bone marrow, brain, cervix, connective tissue, ear, epididymis, eye, heart, intestine, kidney, liver, lung, lymph nodes, mammary glands, mouth, muscle, nerve, oesophagus, ovary, pancreas, pharynx, placenta, prostate, pituitary gland, salivary gland, testis, thyroid, tonsil, thymus, trachea, skin, uterus, spleen, spinal cord, stomach and vascular tissue. It is also expressed in ascites and various embryonic tissues. It is expressed at high level in the intestine, lung, lymph nodes, pituitary and vascular tissues. This gene is also known as KIAA0372, MGC32587 and TPR repeat protein 37. This gene is located on the Crick (minus) strand of the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q15). The gene is 91,113 bases in length and encodes a protein of 1564 amino acid residues with twenty tetratricopeptide repeats. It has 43 exons of which exons 1, 2 and 3 are non coding. The predicted molecular weight of the protein is 175.486 kiloDaltons and its predicted pI is 7.47. Its function is unknown but it may have adenylate cyclase activity and calcium- and calmodulin-responsive adenylate cyclase activity. A homolog has been identified in the frog (Xenopus tropicalis), the mouse (Mus musculus) and the rat (Rattus norvegicus). In the mouse this gene is located on chromosome 13. Diagnosis Microscopic analysis of the hair shaft showing breaks located at nodes in the hair (trichorrhexis nodosa) and longitudinal breaks. Small intestine biopsy of a patient with THE syndrome showing severe villous atrophy with intense mononuclear cell infiltration in the lamina propria. (Courtesy of Prof. Michel Peuchmaur, H√¥pital Robert Debr√©, Paris, France) =Facial features= The typical facial features are low-set ears, prominent eyes with hypertelorism, broad flat nose, prominent forehead and large mouth. =Liver= There may be fibrosis with bile duct proliferation, occasional giant cells and regenerative parenchymal nodules. Siderosis is common. =Small bowel= Microscopic examination of a biopsy of the small bowel in these patients shows villous atrophy with low or no mononuclear cell infiltration of the lamina propria nor specific abnormalities involving the epithelium. The amount of villous atrophy does not explain the severity of the diarrhea. Studies of enterocyte brush-border ion transporter proteins (sodium-hydrogen exchanger 2, sodium-hydrogen exchanger 3, aquaporin 7, sodium iodide symporter and hydrogen potassium adenosine triphosphatase) showed reduced expression or mislocalization in all patients with different profiles for each. =Hair= Microscopic analysis of the hair shows twisted hairs of unequal size and different shapes (pili torti, aniso- and poikilotrichosis), longitudinal breaks and breaks located at nodes (trichorrhexis nodosa). Scanning electron microscopy might reveal hair budding (trichorrhexis blastysis). Biochemical analysis may reveal sulfur-deficient brittle hair (trichothiodystrophy; note that disulfide bonds determine hair waviness). =Platelets= Platelets may be enlarged. The membrane surface connected canalicular system is disrupted with prominent tubules and small membranous vesicles. Alpha granules may be missing from the platelets. Despite these abnormalities there is no increased tendency to bleed in this syndrome. =Other= Immunodeficiency is a consistent feature with low serum concentrations of immunoglobulins which may improve with age and a poor immunological response to childhood vaccination. T cell dysfunction and abnormal antibody generation have been reported. Treatment No specific treatment or cure exists. Affected children usually need total parenteral nutrition through a central venous catheter. Further worsening of liver damage should however be avoided if possible. Diarrhea will likely continue even though food stops passing through the gastrointestinal system. They can subsequently be managed with tube feeding, and some may be weaned from nutritional support during adolescence. Epidemiology Tricho-hepato-enteric syndrome is estimated to affect 1 in 300,000 to 400,000 live births in Western Europe. This syndrome was first reported in 1982 with a report on 2 siblings, and as of 2008 there were around 25 published cases in medical journals. There seem to be no racial differences in its occurrence. It might be more common, as many genetic diseases, in areas with high levels of consanguinity.

A neighborhood to the south of this area is still sometimes known by this name; the former location of Milneburg is now in the Lake Terrace/Lake Oaks, New Orleans section, mostly under the current campus of the University of New Orleans. History This now land-locked lighthouse was at the end of Milneburg pier before the land around it was reclaimed. (This 1855 brick lighthouse replaced an earlier wooden one from 1832.) Milneburg was named for landowner-developer Alexander Milne. However local pronunciation came to call it \\"Mill-en-burg\\" or \\"Mil-lan-burg\\" instead of \\"Miln-burg\\", and the name has often been seen in print misspelled Milenberg and variations. Early on it was officially designated Port Pontchartrain, but the \\"Milneburg\\" name soon replaced this for all uses except for United States Coast Guard designation of the lighthouse there, which continued to be listed as \\"Port Pontchartrain Lighthouse\\" to 1929. In the early 19th century Milneburg was connected to the city of New Orleans, which was then limited to the riverfront area, by Elysian Fields Avenue. In 1830 it was decided to build the region's first railway along this route, and the Pontchartrain Rail-Road began steam locomotive transport of people and cargo along the route on 23 April 1831. A long pier was built into the shallows of the lake, with a portion of the rail line running atop it, enabling ocean-going ships to dock at Milneburg. The port boomed, and hotels, saloons, bath houses, and resorts were built around it, mostly atop high wooden piers in the shallows of the lake, connected by a network of pier-like wooden boardwalks. The importance of Milneburg in shipping declined in the late 19th century, but it remained an important resort. A series of \\"camps\\" (houses on piers in the shallows of the lake) were regularly rented out for parties, with fishing, picnics, and dancing to live bands. Milneburg was important in the early development of jazz. Bands from different parts of the city and across racial lines would listen to each other and try to outdo each other here. Musician Sharkey Bonano grew up in Milneburg, and the area is commemorated in the New Orleans Rhythm Kings tune \\"Milenburg Joys\\" which has remained a jazz standard. In the 1920s and 1930s a project to dredge new land on what had been the shallows of Lake Pontchartrain extended the shoreline out, and that was the end of old Milneburg. The Pontchartrain Beach amusement park was built on what had been the center of Milneburg. Later the University of New Orleans was established nearby. The neighborhood now designated as \\"Milneburg\\" by the New Orleans Planning Commission is actually to the south and inland of the historic Milneburg; see Milneburg, New Orleans, for the modern neighborhood.

More than 1400 British troops defeated about 500 warriors of the Kingitanga (MƒÅori King Movement), which was resisting the expansion of British settlement and colonial rule in the North Island. The battle cost both sides more than any other engagement of the land wars and also resulted in the capture of 180 MƒÅori prisoners, which impacted on their subsequent ability to oppose the far bigger British force. The British success at Rangiriri and several subsequent battles opened the Waikato basin to the British forces and the government subsequently confiscated 1.3 million hectares of land for use by settlers. In 1995 the Crown apologised for its actions.  The Rangiriri defences  Since early August 1863 Kingitanga forces had been fighting the British advance into Waikato territory from the so-called Meremere line, a 22 km-long line of fortifications that spread from Pukekawa to Meremere and Paparata. The defensive line commanded about 2000 square kilometres of bush and was manned by a force of up to 1500. On October 31 the British commander, Lieutenant- General Duncan Cameron, landed troops on the banks of the Waikato River 15 km south of Meremere, ready to make an assault on the main fortification from the rear with a total force of 1200 men. The following day the MƒÅori forces evacuated Meremere and retreated south to Rangiriri, their next defensive line. Work on the Rangiriri line had begun before the fall of Meremere with a 500 m long double ditch dug between the Waikato River and Lake Kopuera. Strengthening work had continued during the earlier campaign based at Meremere, and concentrated work began in early November 1863 under the direction of Te Wharepu, a leading Waikato chief. The front line ran east‚Äìwest, comprising a long trench, behind which was a parapet of banked-up earth and another trench. The trenches were between 2.7m and 4.2m deep, with the parapet between 4.2m and 6.3m from the base of the trench. Another line of defences ran south from the main line at right angles to it, facing the river to protect the line from any river-borne force. In the centre of the main line lay a small but well-protected north-facing redoubt with several lines of concealed rifle pits at its southern side. A second series of outlying works were located on a spur to the south and east of the main defence line. The defences consisted solely of earthworks, with no palisading, while the redoubt, whose low profile meant it escaped detection by Cameron on river- borne reconnaissance missions on 30 October and 18 November, was deceptively strong. (The eastern part of the double ditch and some of the outlying works were destroyed with the making of State Highway 1. From the central redoubt earthworks, Lake Kopuera is about 105 m to the east.)Waikato topographical map.  Opposing forces  Cameron commanded a battle force totalling more than 1400 men. On the morning of 20 November he left Meremere to march up the bank of the Waikato River with about 850 men to make the frontal assault. His division comprised members of the 65th Regiment (386), 14th Regiment (186), 12th Regiment (112), Royal Artillery, Royal Navy (100) and Royal Engineers (15). A second division, consisting of 320 men of the 40th Regiment under Lieut-Colonel Arthur Leslie with another 200 seamen and marines as a backup, were transported by barge further south with the aim of gaining possession of a ridge 500 metres behind the main entrenchment and cutting off any escape. The British assault force assembled about 700 metres north of Rangiriri, with three Armstrong guns, including one six-pounder and a 12-pounder. The storming party was equipped with revolvers, Enfield rifles with fixed bayonets and hand grenades. Two gunboats, the Pioneer and the HMS Curacoa were positioned on the Waikato River.https://teara.govt.nz/en/new-zealand-wars/page-6 The defending MƒÅori force comprised about 500 men, mostly armed with double-barreled shotguns and muskets. They were from Ngati Mahuta and other Waikato sub-tribes including Ngatiteata, Ngatihine and Patupou, with outside support from Kawhia Ngati Mahuta, Ngati Paoa and Ngati Haua under Wiremu Tamehana and Tiriori. It appears Wiremu Tamihana was in the pƒÅ at the start of the battle but left after the major attacks. He was seen approaching Rangiriri after the surrender, with 400 MƒÅori warriors which were en route to Rangiriri, but turned back after the MƒÅori surrender the next day.  The battle  About 3pm on 20 November Cameron ordered the start of a two-hour artillery bombardment, with additional fire coming from gunboats Curacoa and Pioneer. At 4.45pm, Leslie's division had still not landed because of strong flood currents and adverse winds but Cameron‚Äîconcerned about the onset of darkness and the risk that his enemy would again escape‚Äîdecided to launch his southward frontal attack. It began with two separate groups: 320 members of the 65th under Colonel Wyatt, with Royal Engineers on Cameron's right (the river side) and 290 men of the 12th and 14th under Colonel Austen extending the line to the British left. British casualties began to mount as they stormed the MƒÅori positions across the 600 m gap under heavy fire. Two colonels, Austen and Phelps, were both killed as the 12th and 14th headed for the centre of the 500m-long line, unaware it was the location of the redoubt, its strongest section. Two officers of the 12th made a desperate attempt to climb the earthworks, but almost every man who reached the top with the aid of ladders was immediately shot down. The repulse of the assault left about 40 British dead or wounded. Members of the 65th Regiment, meanwhile, were faltering under the withering fire, taking cover before being stirred to resume their advance. They reached the trenches at the river side of the fortification, bridged them with planks and managed to penetrate the MƒÅori line, possibly because much of the garrison had moved to the central redoubt to fend off the attack. About 30 MƒÅori were killed and the surviving defenders abandoned the river-facing trenches and began fleeing south. Cameron ordered the remaining company of reserves to join the 65th in attacking the central redoubt from the west and south, but the 500-strong force began to come under the same heavy fire from the redoubt and adjacent works that had stopped the 12th and 14th. One group of British found themselves cut off at the rear entrance to the redoubt. \\"At one time,\\" wrote historian James Belich, \\"four British corpses, seven wounded men and seven unhurt men were crammed into this corner. More men were killed while trying to go to their aid.\\" Leslie's men from the 40th Regiment, having finally landed, were by then arriving on the scene from the south and pressuring the MƒÅori, who were withdrawing to the central redoubt. Cameron ordered a detachment of 36 Royal Artillery, armed with revolvers and swords, to storm the central redoubt, resulting in more deaths, including Captain Mercer. A second wave, this time of Royal Navy men armed with rifle and cutlass, was also cut down, and further assaults were made with hand-grenades thrown into the redoubt by seamen. The further losses lifted Cameron's casualties to about 110. As night fell, the remaining 400 MƒÅori defenders maintained a strong hold on the centre and eastern end of the line. The British, dispirited by the scale of losses, spent the night bivouacked on the wet ground, ready to renew the combat in the morning. During the night more hand-grenades were hurled into the redoubt and an abortive attempt was made to mine the parapet, but the soldiers continued to undermine the parapet with picks and shovels,New Zealand Wars:A History of the Maori Campaign and the Pioneering period:Volume 1 Chapter 35,p 331-332 while the defenders sang and chanted and returned occasional gunfire. More members of the garrison evacuated during the night, including chief Wiremu Tamihana and possibly King TƒÅwhiao. = Capture = Printed list of MƒÅori Prisoners taken at Rangiriri (1863) After being subject to intermittent grenade attacks during the night by soldiers who had stayed in the wet trenches, around 5am a white flag was flown from the parapet by the MƒÅori, expecting to talk terms with Cameron. British soldiers advanced on the redoubt and entered, shaking hands with their combatants before surprising the MƒÅori by demanding they surrender all their arms and taking them prisoner. The MƒÅori did not attempt to resist.https://teara.govt.nz/en/new-zealand-wars/page-6 They were transported by boat to the Great South Road, then marched to Auckland. Although historian James Cowan claimed the garrison unconditionally surrendered because they had run out of ammunition, Belich says this is false because the bulk of evidence shows they still had a plentiful supply in the morning. Edmund Bohan says that Maori would have been forced to surrender within a short time and the early surrender saved lives on both sides.Climates of War.E Bohan. p147-152 2005.Hazard. Christchurch.

Belich's conclusion is that the capture of 183 MƒÅori at Rangiriri was a clear act of duplicity on the part of the British‚Äî\\"both the British and (since 1860) the MƒÅoris were perfectly well aware that showing a white flag did not necessarily mean surrender\\"‚Äîyet while Cameron's action was not honourable, it was understandable. \\"Cameron had had eight assaults on the central redoubt bloodily repulsed, and it was not surprising that he should seize his chance rather than risk more of his men, particularly in the case of what he perceived as a 'savage' enemy.\\" Belich wrote: \\"The capture of Rangiriri was not the result of assault or encirclement, but of the British misuse of a flag of truce. The MƒÅoris might conceivably have eventually decided to surrender unconditionally anyway, but they might also have repelled further assaults and escaped across the lake.\\" He said they may have also been gaining time waiting for reinforcements who were almost on the scene. About 35 of the MƒÅori force were killed, along with six women and children. Probably an equal number of injured were evacuated by canoe across Lake Waikare. With the capture of more than 180 warriors, the battle became the most costly MƒÅori defeat in the Waikato wars.  Aftermath  The 183 prisoners were taken by boat to the Great South Road, then marched to Auckland. They were initially held on the Marion, an old coal hulk in WaitematƒÅ Harbour before being moved to the disused copper mine smelter on Kawau Island, north of Auckland. The prisoners were allowed the use of fishing boats to supplement their diet. Premier Frederick Whitaker and Colonial Secretary William Fox, meanwhile, debated bringing charges of high treason against all or some of them but disagreed on whether they should be tried by the Supreme Court or by court martial under the Suppression of Rebellion Act, a piece of legislation passed in late 1863 that authorised the Governor to arrest and detain indefinitely anyone suspected of complicity in the \\"rebellion\\". The Act provided for punishment by death, imprisonment or corporal punishment such as whipping. Dr Arini Loader, a lecturer at Victoria University of Wellington, has stated that there was a rumour at the time the ship was going to be towed out to the ocean and sunk. \\"They didn‚Äôt know if they were going to be lined up and shot. Neither Grey nor his ministers knew what to do with them,\\" she said.\\"New Zealand Wars prisoners‚Äô waiata remain a beacon of hope,\\" Victoria University of Wellington website, 14 December 2018. The prisoners were never charged nor tried by any tribunal. On the night of 11 September 1864 the 200 prisoners on Kawau seized all boats on the island and paddled to the mainland using spades, shovels and pieces of board they had fashioned into paddles. The group landed at Waikauri Bay and set up camp on a ridge overlooking Omaha and Matakana. They refused pleas by the prison keeper to return to Kawau and were eventually permitted by the government to make their way back to the Waikato. Auckland newspapers at the time reported that it had cost the vast sum of ¬£9000 to look after the escapees and therefore no effort should be made to bring them back. The British dead were mainly buried in a small graveyard in the Rangiriri township which is open to the public.Rangiriri Pa, New Zealand Historic Places Trust website. Two Victoria Crosses were awarded after the battle‚Äîto Assistant Surgeon William Temple for disregarding his own welfare in attending to the wounded during the assaults at the end of the day and Lieutenant Arthur Pickard for showing courage in running through enemy fire to reach Cameron and seek help. Cameron attracted both praise for his \\"skilful measures\\" in the capture of Rangiriri and severe criticism over the high number of British losses. Yet the battle had highlighted the rapidly growing disparity between British and MƒÅori forces and the inability of Waikato MƒÅori to maintain their manpower continuously because of the need to sustain their tribal economy and attend to domestic needs. Tamehana sent his own mere to Cameron soon after the battle, and this was interpreted as a token of submission. Several Waikato chiefs including Te Wharepu expressed a willingness to negotiate and on 8 December the Kingite capital at NgƒÅruawƒÅhia was abandoned and then taken by Cameron's troops. But MƒÅori were still opposed to the British demands of submitting to the Queen and surrendering all arms and lands and began building further defences south of NgƒÅruawƒÅhia. Wiremu Te Wheoro, a chief of NgƒÅti Naho who was loyal to the government, was installed in a wooden redoubt constructed on a high point east of the main earth redoubt at Rangigiri. Te Wheoro, who served as a magistrate in the Native Land Court‚Äîand about 30 of his men manned the wooden redoubt until 1868 to prevent any disruption by Kingites to the British supply line. Te Wheoro later resigned in disgust at corruption within the court and in 1879 entered Parliament as the Member for Western Maori.Wiremu Te Morehu Maipapa Te Wheoro, New Zealand History Online website.

Proto's 30-year collaboration with the French/Syrian virtuoso Francois Rabbath has resulted in 5 works for double bass and orchestra. As a solo double bassist Proto has been widely recorded in an ongoing series of his chamber works by Red Mark Records. In 2010, Proto's boxing opera Shadowboxer, based on the life of Joe Louis‚Äîlibretto by John Chenault, directed by Leon Major‚Äîwas given its premiere by the University of Maryland Opera Studio.

He is the founder of FenceSitter Films, a production company devoted to entertainment for women, and sexual and ethnic minorities. He currently lives and works in Los Angeles, where he directs films, music videos, a Web series and commercials for his production company FenceSitterFilms. Career Schickner attended Harvard from 1993 to 1995 before dropping out to start Off-Off-Broadway theater company, Fencesitter Productions. Based out of the Stanford Meisner Theater, the company produced four successful plays, three of which were written and directed by Schickner himself. While in college, inspired by hearing a talk given by bisexual rights activist Lani Ka'ahumanu, he formed BIAS (Bisexuals Achieving Solidarity) the first college bisexual rights group in the United States. After seeking out the campus' gay and lesbian organization, Schickner recalls, \\"I knew I was bisexual, but those who ran the club didn't believe it.\\" He later went on to appear on CNN, Montel Williams, Jane Pratt and several other national television shows, helping to give visibility to what was at that time a largely invisible community. After writing and producing three successful plays, Schickner moved to cinema in hope of reaching a wider audience. In 1995, FenceSitter Films (the former Fencesitter Productions) started production on Rose by Any Other Name..., a film based on Schickner's most successful play. According to the official website, FenceSitter Films was \\"founded on the belief that films don't need straight white men as heroes in order to be successful and entertaining.\\" He says, \\"I wanted to make films [that] a person of color, a woman, or a bisexual person would enjoy watching.\\" Schickner has written and directed five feature films, several commercials and music videos and is now currently producing a Web series of Rose by Any Other Name.... His features include romantic comedy Rose by Any Other Name..., mockumentary Full Frontal, and the critically acclaimed thriller Strange Fruit. His most current feature film, Steam, stars Oscar-nominated actress Ruby Dee, 1980s and indie icon Ally Sheedy as well as up-and-coming young actress Kate Siegel. In late 2008 into 2009 Schickner began working with an American Cable TV Network to spin-off his original work Rose by Any Other Name... into a weekly TV series. However, according to Schickner \\"at the 11th hour as they were setting up to shoot the pilot the network expressed concern over how the cutting-edge social theme might play with some of their core viewership and decided to look at more data to see what kind of response the show might get\\".

Route description =Holladay and Cottonwood Heights= SR-190 begins at a single point urban interchange with I-215 (though the rightmost lane of the eastbound off-ramp actually leads to 3000 East instead of SR-190) and the road curves to the south as it climbs from the Knudsen's Corner lowlands near Big Cottonwood Creek to run first along the bottom of the south-facing mountainside leading up to Mount Olympus to the north and then along the west-facing mountainside just north of Big Cottonwood Canyon's mouth. The border between the cities of Holladay and Cottonwood Heights loosely follows the route until the intersection with Wasatch Boulevard. North of Wasatch Boulevard, the route passes several office buildings, the Old Mill Golf Course, and a Utah Transit Authority park-and- ride lot. South of Wasatch Boulevard (where SR-190 actually takes on the Wasatch Boulevard name) there is only a quarry to the east and the view to the valley below to the west; at the base of the cliff, but out of sight, is the old paper mill building with which the area is often identified. The route continues south over a bridge spanning Big Cottonwood Creek and the planned final phase of the Big Cottonwood Creek multi-use trail at the mouth of the canyon, then intersects with SR-210, which continues south as Wasatch Boulevard, and Fort Union Boulevard, which heads west. Traffic following SR-190 east must turn left at this intersection. Beyond the intersection, park-and-ride lots used only for ski buses (or otherwise for the benefit of canyon visitors) and a water treatment plant are visible to the north and residential development within Cottonwood Heights city occupies the slope to the south. =Big Cottonwood Canyon= Westbound SR-190 through Big Cottonwood Canyon Eastbound SR-190 through Big Cottonwood Canyon, seen from the north Signs of urban development quickly disappear as the canyon walls get closer together. The route passes many trailheads and picnic areas within the canyon, as well as historic water- and mining-related infrastructure and a few areas of cabins, before passing Solitude Mountain Resort and looping through Brighton. =Guardsman Pass= After looping through Brighton, the route connects (with some backtracking) to a narrower mountain road across Guardsman Pass, terminating (with a non-state-maintained connection through to Park City via SR-224 and Midway/Heber City via SR-222) at the top of the pass as it enters Wasatch County. This part of the road is normally closed all winter. History The first piece of present SR-190 was added to the state highway system in 1933 as part of SR-152, which followed Highland Drive, 6200 South, and Big Cottonwood Canyon Road from Salt Lake City to the Uinta-Wasatch-Cache National Forest boundary in Big Cottonwood Canyon. In 1941, SR-152 was extended east in the forest to Brighton, and in 1945 the connection from Highland Drive to the canyon was moved south to Fort Union Boulevard. In order to provide access to the new Wasatch Mountain State Park, SR-152 was extended east from Brighton in 1963, following an existing county road over Guardsman Pass to end at SR-224. Finally, in 1987, a piece in the middle of SR-152, from I-215 south and east to Wasatch Boulevard (SR-210), was removed from the state highway system. In its place was a proposed limited access road, extending 6200 South past I-215 and along Wasatch Boulevard to Big Cottonwood Canyon Road. To avoid an overlap of SR-152 on I-215, the new roadway became an extension of SR-210, and former SR-152 from Wasatch Boulevard to SR-224 became a new State Route 190.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 To avoid the necessity of remileposting SR-210, the new connection instead became part of SR-190 in 1988, bringing that route to its maximum extent: I-215 to SR-224. As part of a trade with Wasatch County in which the state took back what is now SR-32, and had been US-189, from US-40 south of the Jordanelle Reservoir to Francis, the east end of SR-190 was cut back to the Salt Lake-Wasatch County line in 1990.Utah Department of Transportation, Highway Resolutions: , updated November 2007, accessed May 2008 Major intersections References 190 190 190 Category:Tourist attractions in Salt Lake County, Utah ","title":"Utah State Route 190"},{"id":"18137286","text":"Putnam) Riding the Iron Rooster (1988) is a travel book by Paul Theroux primarily about his travels through China in the 1980s.

All dune systems on the western side of the island and the large coastal plains on both the northern and southern points of the island are part of the park. The park covers approximately and attained national park status in 2002. The visitor center is located in the natural history museum . In 1927 botanist Jac. P. Thijsse made an illustrated book about the flora and fauna on the island, and pointed out the major environmental values of the island. This book was one of a series, the book was sold very cheaply, and the pictures for the book came free with each Verkade chocolate bar. There are many walking trails which follow either red, yellow, blue or green signs The green routes are not accessible during the bird breeding season. Many bicycle trails cross the park as well. Areas Sea-Buckthorn near Ecomare From south to north the park comprises the following areas: *De Hors *De Geul *De Mok *De Bollekamer *De Westerduinen *De Dennen *Het Duinpark *Calniforni√´-bos *De Seetingsnollen *Camping Kogerstrand *De Muy *De Slufter *De Haneplas *Krimbos *Eijerlandse Duinen *Camping de Robbejager =De Hors= The Hors is at the most southerly point of Texel and is largely owned by the Dutch Ministry of Defence. The terrain is used for amphibious training. The defense complex build on the Mok bay is called de Mok. The southern part of the Hors is a large coastal plain which was formed because in the past shoals \\"walked\\" toward the island, the last shoal to do so was Onrust in 1910. On the plains new dunes are being formed. On the newest dunes \\"biestarwegras\\" (Elytrigia juncea subsp. boreoatlantica) is found, and on the somewhat older dunes you will find marram grass. In the moist dune valleys Parnassia, Dactylorhiza and Centaurium have sprung. The Kreeftenpolder is a dune valley which was formed because a sandbar was built separating it from the coastal plain. The supervisor of the project, Jaap Kreeft gave the polder its name. In the valley the Liparis loeselii and the \\"armbloemige waterbies\\" (Eleocharis quinqueflora) grow. Since the year 2000 a large part of it is flooded. On the other side of the sandbar two small lakes have formed, the Horsmeertjes. =De Geul= The Geul is a wet dune valley, originally it was part of Mok bay, but a dam was built so that drinking water could be extracted from the dunes. Here the largest colony on Texel of common spoonbill breeds. After the extraction of water stopped in 1993 the area became much wetter. Through a ditch with fish ladders, water can escape to the Mok, and three-spined stickleback can enter the Geul from the Wadden Sea. The presence of these fish made the spoonbills decide to breed here. Both highland cattle and Exmoor ponies graze in the area. =De Bollekamer= The Bollekamer is situated between beach poles 9 and 12, north of Den Hoorn. In the eastern part rocky loam is found very near the surface, this surface does not let water through, therefore this area has the highest groundwater level of the entire dune system. The valleys are influenced by the lime rich groundwater. Highland cattle graze on the Bollekamer. Vegetation in De Nederlanden end of May =De Muy= The Muy is named after the dune lake that was formed when the North Sea broke through the outer dunes in 1851. This is the oldest known breeding spot for the spoonbill on Texel. In the 1990s the number of spoonbills decreased, while more breeding great cormorants came to the area. De Nederlanden is also part of the Muy, in a land improvement project pastures were made. That area is now managed extensively. Among other plants the Green- winged Orchid grows here. = De Slufter = De Slufter Aerial view of De Slufter The main part of the Slufter is a wide dune valley which has an open connection to the North Sea through a hole in the outer dunes . At high tide seawater streams into the Slufter though creeks and at low tide it streams out again. The large Sluftercreek at the beach is where the water comes through most the time. Over time the creek has moved in a northern direction. Because this creek was heavily damaging the dunes on the northern side in May 2004, intervention was needed. A new creek was constructed on the far most southern part of the Slufter, and the old creek was closed up a week later. On an average high tide the seawater only gets into the creeks and small lakes, on an extreme high tide the larger part of the Slufter is inundated. The vegetation consists largely of salt marsh plants. In June the area colors mainly purple because of the Sea-lavender. In October it is mainly red because of the Common glasswort. Sea-buckthorn also grows here. Many birds visit the Slufter estuary. The common eider breeds here, the spoonbill comes to forage and a variety of waders only enter on a high tide. Many seashells of the present sea fauna, as well as many fossil seashells dating back to the Eemian Stage wash on to the coastal plain of the Slufter. The Slufter is separated from the North Sea by two long dune strips, this area is called De Lange Dam. In between the dune stripes there is a valley with fresh water, many orchids grow here. Fauna Texel has a very rich variety of species. =Birds= Commonly sighted birds on the island are: greylag goose, brent goose, shelduck, wigeon, eider, scoter, spoonbill, oystercatcher, pied avocet, golden plover, peewit, knot, dunlin, bar-tailed godwit, common pheasant, european herring gull, lesser black-backed gull, black-headed gull, common tern, sandwich tern, short-eared owl and the hen harrier. Many passerine birds make their home within the dunes, such as starling, northern wheatear, european stonechat, whinchat, white wagtail, western yellow wagtail and meadow pipit. =Mammals= Within the dunes itself common mammals to be found are rabbits, hares, hedgehogs, various small rodents (mice, voles) and the stoat. The beaches, sandbanks and surrounding waters are home to two species of seal, common seal and grey seal, as well as porpoises.

Benjamin is often shortened to Ben, sometimes to Benny, or Benji. It is also a patronymic surname. Like many biblical names, it is popular in the Jewish, Christian and Muslim faiths alike, having many variant forms in other languages. The \\"Benjamin of the family\\" is a phrase used in several languages to refer to the youngest son‚Äîespecially when he is much younger than his brothers. Sometimes the name is chosen for a son born to mature parents unlikely to have more children, especially if he has several older siblings. Both of these usages derive from the biblical son of Jacob of that name, who occupied that position in his family. In some languages, by extension, it is also applied to the runt of a litter of animals. *Benjamin Erickson (2014), Son of Jeremy Erickson *Benjamin II (1818‚Äì1864), the pen name of a Romanian traveller *Pope Benjamin II of Alexandria (1327‚Äì1339), Coptic Pope *Benjamin (Khazar), ruler of the late 9th and early 10th centuries *Saint Benjamin (disambiguation), multiple people *Ben Affleck (born 1972), American film screenwriter, director and actor *Benjamin Agosto (born 1982), American figure skater *Ben Barnes (actor) (born 1981), British actor, Prince Caspian *Ben Bernanke (born 1953), former Chairman of the United States Federal Reserve *Benjamin Biolay (born 1973), French singer, songwriter, producer and actor *Benjamin Britten (1913‚Äì1976), British composer *Benjamin Burnley (born 1978) Lead singer of American rock band Breaking Benjamin *Benjamin Butler (1818‚Äì1893) American lawyer, politician, soldier and businessman *Benjamin Carrigan (born 1998), Australian association football player *Benjamin Chee Chee (1944‚Äì1977), Canadian artist *Benjamin Constant (1767‚Äì1830), Swiss-born French politician *Benjamin Constant (Brazil) (1836‚Äì1891), Brazilian general and politician *Benjamin Cutting (born 1987), Australian cricketer *Benjamin Diskin (born 1982), American voice actor *Benjamin Disraeli (1804‚Äì1881), a 19th-century Prime Minister of the United Kingdom *Benjamin W.

Wasp was built in 1810 at Baltimore, Maryland. She received a privateer's warrant from the United States government in July 1812 when she put to sea for a privateering foray into the West Indies. During that cruise, she stopped three British merchantmen, allowed one to continue because she carried nothing of value, and took the other two as prizes. While putting a prize crew on board the last of the three, the schooner Dawson, the British 22-gun Sixth Rate Post-ship HMS Garland surprised Wasp. Both captor and prize hoisted full sail and got underway. Because Garland chose to chase Wasp, the prize crew easily took Dawson to safety at Savannah, Georgia. Wasp managed to outsail her pursuer; after sailing through a hurricane that cost her both her masts she finally returned to Baltimore on 28 November 1812. At Baltimore, Wasp's owners sold her to a group of businessmen who refitted and rearmed her with a long 9-pounder and then chartered her to the United States Navy as a dispatch boat during the summer of 1813. She passed her brief period of naval service without incident, and the U.S. Navy returned her to her owners that autumn. On 1 October 1813, Wasp was sold at auction at Baltimore. The two merchants who purchased her, Mr. Joseph Lane and Mr. Thomas White, refitted her, rearmed her with a long 4-pounder, and sent her to sea as a privateer. Her second cruise appears to have met with even less success than her first, for the last reference to her career was an advertisement the Baltimore American newspaper ran on 4 August 1814 which called her owners to a meeting on 11 August 1814 to settle accounts. Presumably, she was sold. However, when the privateer Harpy returned to her home port of Salem, Massachusetts in either 1814 or 1815, she reported \\"that the USS Wasp was off the Canaries doing a great business among the English merchant ships\\".{sfnpCoggeshall1856p=316}} As Wasp was in US Naval service during the summer of 1813, this record may relate to that period rather than to 1814 or 1815. It is also possible that this record relates to a later USS Wasp.

The company is a member of the League of Resident Theatres (LORT) and employs some 300 artists annually, including Equity and non-Equity actors, directors, designers and specialty artists. The company stages a year-round season of eight productions - comedies, dramas, and musicals - in the Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts and in the California Mission-style Lucie Stern Theatre complex in Palo Alto. History =Beginnings - 1970s= TheatreWorks Silicon Valley began as the dream of Robert Kelley, a Bay Area native who earned his degree in creative writing from Stanford University in 1968. After teaching at Andover Prep in Massachusetts for a year, Kelley returned to Palo Alto, California in 1970. As a musician and occasional actor, Kelley decided he wanted to make his living doing theatre. He got his chance when the city of Palo Alto then asked him to launch a theatre program that would engage teenagers and reflect the concerns of the community. The result was a powerful and original new musical called, Popcorn, which premiered in July 1970. Popcorn spoke volumes to the local community and reflected the tumultuous changes of the late 1960s and early 1970s. Popcorn became the launching point for a Golden Era of Creativity for the company. In the first 3 years, 13 new productions were written and performed. The small company performed anywhere they could find space - basements, parks, and even old warehouses. But Robert Kelley and TheatreWorks had gained a reputation for putting no limits on creativity. During this time TheatreWorks became known for two distinct qualities‚Äîoutstanding production values and diversity on stage. Despite a small budget, the influx of talented artists from around the Bay Area allowed TheatreWorks to create extraordinary sets and costumes. The company also regularly featured performers of color on the stage at a time when it was a rare occurrence. By the end of the decade the company had grown to include a six-member Board of Directors, four full- time staff, 700 season subscribers and a budget of nearly $150,000 per season. =1980s= In the 1980s, the company focused on diversity and innovation. Newly hired Associate Artistic Director Anthony J. Haney led the charge to increase awareness of TheatreWorks among top caliber performers of color in the Bay Area and to gain credibility in the African-American, Asian, and Latino communities. In 1981, a world premiere musical, The Fireworks Rag, written by Kelley, was the company's first primarily African-American cast. Furthermore, the company continued to introduce Silicon Valley audiences to plays and musicals never before seen on Bay Area stages. The company shifted its focus from writing new material every few years to finding and illuminating the works of emerging authors from around the country. The Stage II Series was implemented where smaller productions by lesser known authors could be explored and produced. In 1985, Randy Adams was hired as the company's first managing director and within three years, TheatreWorks had signed its first contracts with the actor's union, Actors' Equity Association, and reached the $1 million mark for its annual budget. By the end of the decade TheatreWorks had a 16-member Board of Directors, 11 full-time staff, 5500 subscribers and a budget of $1.7 million. =1990s= In the 1990s, the company took up residence in the newly built Mountain View Center for the Performing Arts for 5 performances each season, while still keeping 3 performances in their original home, the Lucie Stern Theatre in Palo Alto. They built a fully functional black box stage in Cubberley Center in Palo Alto, to accommodate the Stage II series. The company encountered new opportunities to produce world premieres with established artists. In the early 1990s, the company presented the world premiere of Josephine, a musical based on the life of Josephine Baker, starring Della Reese. They also mounted a national casting search seeking an all-Native American cast for a new musical called Honor Song for Crazy Horse. TheatreWorks continued to top itself in audience attendance and critical acclaim, until the end of the decade when the company had a 20-member Board, 30 full-time staff members, 8500 subscribers, and a $4.5 million budget. =2000s= In the new millennium, TheatreWorks put in renewed energies toward developing New Works. Most notable was the launching of the New Works Initiative, which strives to support the creation of new work by providing writers with the resources to explore their ideas. In 2005 TheatreWorks became a member of the League of Resident Theatres (LORT). Joining the company in 2006, with years of award- winning experience in regional theatre management and development, Managing Director Phil Santora has helped grow the New Works Initiative in both size and stature, while forging relationships between TheatreWorks and other regional theatres. The company continued to produce world premieres, and in fall 2007 they staged their 50th world premiere, Emma, a musical version of the popular Jane Austen novel. The musical would go on to be TheatreWorks' top-grossing, most-attended production at that time. The Broadway musical Memphis began at TheatreWorks' New Works Festival in 2002 and made its World Premiere as a TheatreWorks Mainstage production in 2004. In 2009, Memphis opened on Broadway and subsequently won four Tony Awards, including Best Musical. During this time period, TheatreWorks also developed a relationship with power-pop musical group GrooveLily. TheatreWorks has produced several of the group's musicals, including Striking 12 and the World Premieres of Long Story Short and Wheelhouse (Mainstage 2012). =2010s= As TheatreWorks concludes its 50th season, it is one of California's largest theatres. A pioneer in diversity programming, a regular home to world and regional premieres, and a widely hailed source of original new works for the American stage, TheatreWorks is the nationally acclaimed theatre of Silicon Valley. In 2017, TheatreWorks presented the world premiere of The Prince of Egypt, a stage musical adaptation based on the hit 1998 DreamWorks Animation film of the same name, with music and lyrics by Stephen Schwartz and a book by Philip LaZebnik. TheatreWorks received the 2019 Regional Theatre Tony Award during the 73rd Tony Awards on June 9, 2019. In June 2020, Founding Artistic Director Robert Kelley retired from the helm of TheatreWorks, ending one of the longest tenures in American Theatre. He was succeeded by Tim Bond, who currently serves as the company's Artistic Director.

Worship and offering of food are highly praised in Hinduism, and therefore, the goddess Annapurna is regarded as a popular deity. She is a manifestation of the goddess Parvati, the consort of Shiva,P. 2001, p. 13 and is eulogized in the Annada Mangal, a narrative poem in Bengali by Bharatchandra Ray. The Annapurna Sahasranam is dedicated to the goddess and praises her one thousand names, while the Annapurna Shatanama Stotram is dedicated to her 108 names. A few temples exist that are dedicated to her, the most prominent being the Annapurna Devi Mandir in Varanasi. Since Akshaya Tritiya is considered to be the birthdate of the goddess Annapurna, the day is believed to be very auspicious for buying gold jewelry. Etymology Annapurna is derived from Sanskrit meaning the giver of food and nourishment. Anna (‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®) means \\"food\\" or \\"grains\\" and p≈´r·πáa (‡§™‡•Ç‡§∞‡•ç‡§£) means \\"full, complete and perfect.\\" It is believed that Mount Annapurna in the Himalayas is named after her as the goddess is believed to be one of the daughters of Himavat, the king of the mountains. The Western world names her the \\"Hindu God of Cooking,\\" considering her association with food items. The other names of Annapurna are: * Vi≈õƒÅlƒÅkshƒ´ (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡§æ‡§≤‡§æ‡§ï‡•ç‡§∑‡•Ä) ‚Äì she who has large eyes. * Vi≈õva≈õakti (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∂‡§ï‡•ç‡§§‡§ø) ‚Äì world power. * Vi≈õvamƒÅtƒÅ (Sanskrit: ‡§µ‡§ø‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡§æ) ‚Äì mother of the world. * S·πõ·π£tihetukƒÅvaradƒÅnƒ´ (Sanskrit: ‡§∏‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§ü‡§ø‡§π‡•á‡§§‡•Å‡§ï‡§æ‡§µ‡§∞‡§¶‡§æ‡§®‡•Ä) ‚Äì she who is a boon granter for the sake of the world. * Bhuvane≈õvarƒ´ (Sanskrit: ‡§≠‡•Å‡§µ‡§®‡•á‡§∂‡•ç‡§µ‡§∞‡•Ä) ‚Äì goddess of earth. * Renu ‚Äì goddess of Atom. * AnnadƒÅ (Sanskrit: ‡§Ö‡§®‡•ç‡§®‡§¶‡§æ) ‚Äì donor of food. Legend Annapoorna serving food to Shiva One day, the god Shiva and his consort Parvati got into an argument about the material world. Shiva said that everything materialistic was just an illusion, including the food that the humans ate. This infuriated Parvati, who governs materialistic aspects. To show Shiva and the world her importance, she disappeared, saying that she wanted to see how the world would survive without her. With Parvati's disappearance, the world was deprived of food, and there occurred a famine. Shiva's followers begged him for food; even the Gods were forced to beg for food, but could not find any food. Finally, Shiva and his followers came to know that there was only one kitchen on earth, in the city of Varanasi (Kashi), where food was still available. Shiva went to Kashi to beg for food. To his surprise, the kitchen was owned by his wife Parvati, but in the form of Annapurna. She wore celestial purple and brown garments, which were lightly adorned with ornaments. She was seated on a throne, serving and distributed food to the starving gods and hungry inhabitants of the earth. Annapurna offered her food as alms to Shiva and made him realize that as Brahman, Shiva might have outgrown hunger; but his followers had not.  Iconography  Annapurna with a ladle and pot. The Agamas (religious texts) describe the iconography of Annapoorna as a youthful goddess having red complexion with a face round like the full moon, three eyes, high breasts, and four hands. The lower left hand is depicted as holding a vessel full of delicious porridge. The right hand with a golden ladle adorned with various jewels. The other two hands depict the Abhaya and Varada poses. She is depicted with wristlets and golden jewelry on her chest. She is seated on a throne with the crescent moon adorning her head.P. 2001, p. 19 In some depictions, Shiva is shown standing to her right with a begging bowl, begging her for alms. Shiva in Annapoorna Stotra described the deity always holding a scripture, akshamala and opener of doors of Moksha in her hands in place of vessel and ladle, indicating his prayer to Annapoorna being spiritual perfection rather than food.P. 2001, p. 20  Literary sources  Annapurna is mentioned in Hindu religious texts such as the Rudrayamala, Sivarahasya, Annapurnamantratsava, Maha Tripurasiddhanta, Annapurna Kavacha, Annapurnahavamti, Annapurnamalininaksatramalika, and Bhairvahyantantra. The Kumara Sambhavam by Kalidasa makes vivid mention about Varanasi and the deity Annapurna. The goddess is also described as the source of knowledge and the main deity in the Annapurna Upanishad, which is considered a minor Upanishad among the 108 Upanishads. In this text, praying to Annapurna is the means by which the sage Ribhu attains knowledge. The Devi Bhagavata written during the 3rd and 4th centuries CE refers to Annapurna as the goddess of Kanchipuram and Vishalakshi as the goddess of Varanasi. The Skanda Purana, written during the 7th century, states the sage Vyasa was led to Varanasi by a curse, and Annapurna came as a housewife and offered him food. The Linga Purana mentions that Shiva was begging for food for his children as he could not get food in the world due to a miracle created by his consort Parvati. Parvati came out as Annapurna and offered food to Shiva at his doorsteps. The legend of Kasi Viswanath Temple in Varanasi is associated with the story that Shiva built the temple there in her honour.P. 2001, p. 18 Adi Sankara (8th century), the proponent of the Advaita school of Hinduism, has written Annapurna Stotra, a book glorifying the deity. The mention of Annapurna is also found in Kumara Sambhava, a Telugu literature, by Nannechola, a Shaiva poet of the 12th century. There is also a mention of the deity in Kasikhanda by Srinatha, a Telugu poet of the 13th century.  Worship  Food is considered sacred in Hinduism, and prayers are offered before consuming it. The person who identifies the importance of Annam (food) within the five layers of the body helps carry life in the worldly process and subsequently seeks to identify Brahman, the enlightenment. Annadana, the donation of food, is highly praised in Hinduism. The importance of Annadana is prescribed in the Vishnu Dharamottara, Agni Purana, Padma Purana, Kurma Purana, Nandi Purana, and Vayu Purana.P. 2001, p. 17 Annapoorna with consort Shiva Annapurna is worshipped through the recitation of her thousand names and her one hundred and eight names. The Sri Annapurna Ashtakam composed by Shankaracharya is chanted by several devout Hindus around the world as a prayer for nourishment, wisdom, and renunciation. Before partaking of any food, Hindus chant the following prayer: The Annapurna Vrat Katha containing stories of her devotees are also recited by her devotees. In Marathi weddings, the bride is given metal idols of goddess Annapurna and Bala Krishna by her mother. She worships them before the wedding, by offering rice and grains to the idols. This Viddhi (custom) is known as Gauri Harap. She also takes images of her husband\`s house and places the idols on them.  Temples  Though Annapurna is a popular deity, there are few temples dedicated to her. * (Annapurna Devi Mandir) dedicated to Annapurna is in Varanasi, U.P. Annapurna is the Goddess of the city of Kashi (Varanasi), where she is regarded as the queen of Varanasi alongside her consort Vishweshwar (Shiva), the King of Varanasi. In the temple, at noon every day, prasad (foods offered to the goddess) are distributed to the elderly and disabled. During Navaratri, food is distributed on a larger scale. * In West Bengal, the ShivaShakti Annapurna temple in Barrackpore was built by Rani Rashmoni's daughter Jagadamba Devi in 1875.

Twentieth century =Early 20th Century= Early LGBT organizations in the United States were, like earlier German organizations, primarily centered around the rights of gay men. The Society for Human Rights was founded in 1924 in Chicago, Illinois by Henry Gerber, who was inspired by Hirschfeld's work in Germany and produced the first gay-rights-oriented publication in the US, Friendship and Freedom. The first national gay rights organization, the Mattachine Society, was formed in 1951, was created by Harry Hay. The first lesbian rights organization in the US was founded in 1955. The Daughters of Bilitis was founded in San Francisco, California by activist couple Del Martin and Phyllis Lyon. In 1966, National Transsexual Counseling Unit was formed in San Francisco. =Post-Stonewall= In the wake of the Stonewall riots, LGBT organizations began to flourish around the United States, including politically active organizations. The Alice B. Toklas LGBT Democratic Club was founded in 1971 by Martin & Lyon, as well as activists Beth Elliot and Ben Foster. In 1976, Harvey Milk founded a splinter organization known as the San Francisco Gay Democratic Club. 21st century See also *List of LGBT- related organizations References Category:Civil rights organizations ","title":"LGBT rights organization"},{"id":"18137588","text":"Albert Elzear Morel (March 5, 1870 - September 7, 1949) was a Canadian ice hockey player for the Ottawa Hockey Club from 1890 to 1894.

Kartikeya is a popular Hindu deity in India and is worshiped across the length and breadth of the country. Like most Hindu deities, He is known by many other names, including ', ', ', Arumugam or Shanmukha (meaning 'one with six faces'), ' (meaning 'child or son'), ', ' (meaning 'that which is spilled or oozed, namely seed' in Sanskrit).Clothey p.49 Skanda is derived from the verb skan·∏çr meaning \\"to attack, leap, rise, fall, be spilled, ooze\\" The Kushanas, who governed from what is today Peshawar, and the Yaudheyas, a republican clan in the Punjab, stuck coins bearing the image of Skanda. The deity was venerated also by the Ikshvakus, an Andhra dynasty, and the Guptas.Ratna Navaratnam ; Karttikeya, the divine child:the Hindu testament of wisdom published in 1973 by the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan Legend The Skanda Purana narrates that Shiva first wed Sati, the granddaughter of Brahma, and the daughter of Daksha. Daksha never liked Shiva, who symbolizing destruction and detachment, begs for food, dances in a graveyard smeared with ashes, and has no possessions, not even good clothes for himself. Daksha publicly insulted Shiva in a Yagna ceremony, and Sati immolated Herself in anger over this treatment of Her husband. The Yagna was destroyed by the ganas of Shiva led by Virabhadra. Shiva was an ascetic and his earlier marriage was conducted with great difficulty; his remarriage was out of the question. Hence Taraka believed that his boon of being killed by Shiva's son alone would give him invincibility. The Devas manage to get Shiva remarried to Parvati by having Kama, the God of love awaken him from his penance, incurring his wrath in the process. Shiva hands over his effulgence of the third eye used to destroy Kama to Agni, as he alone is capable of handling it until it becomes the desired offspring. But even Agni, tortured by its heat, hands it over to Ganga who in turn deposits it in a lake in a forest of reeds (shara). The child is finally born in this forest (vana) with six faces - eesanam, sathpurusham, vamadevam, agoram, sathyojatham and adhomugam. He is first spotted and cared for by six women representing the Pleiades - Kritika in Sanskrit. He thus gets named Karttikeya. As a young lad, he destroyed Taraka. He is also known as Kumara (Sanskrit for youth). Location of the temple This famous temple is situated in the center of Pehowa in Kurukshetra district of Haryana. Pehowa is at a distance of 200 kilometers from Delhi and 60 kilometers from Karnal. It is also very close to the state of Punjab as it lies on the border of the two states, Haryana and Punjab. Rules Women are strictly forbidden in this temple which celebrates the brahmachari form of Lord Kartikeya. The devotees observe very strict rules during the months of Chaturmas (the months from Ashadha through Kartik). It is said that a true devotee of this shrine never loses any battles in his life.

Registries are different from indexes in that they contain more extensive data. In its simplest form, a disease registry could consist of a collection of paper cards kept inside \\"a shoe box\\" by an individual physician. Most frequently registries vary in sophistication from simple spreadsheets that only can be accessed by a small group of physicians to very complex databases that are accessed online across multiple institutions. They can provide health providers (or even patients) with reminders to check certain tests in order to reach certain quality goals. Versus electronic medical records Registries are less complex and simpler to set up than electronic medical records that according to a recent survey are only used by 9% of small offices where almost half of the US doctors work. An electronic medical record keeps track of all the patients a doctor follows but a registry only keeps track of a small sub population of patients with a specific condition. Types of medical conditions tracked More than 130 million Americans live with chronic diseases and chronic diseases account for 70% of all deaths in the US. \\"The medical care costs of people with chronic diseases account for more than 75% of the nation's $2 trillion medical care costs.\\" Registries target certain conditions because medical expenses are unevenly distributed: most health care expenses are spent treating patients with a few chronic conditions. For example, the 2002 expenses with diabetes in the US was $132 billion, and this was around 12% of the US medical budget. Diabetes accounts for 25% of the Medicare budget. Given this, diabetes is one of the conditions targeted by registries. Diabetes is also amenable to this because there is a target population that can be defined according to certain rules and there is evidence that certain tests like retina exams, LDL levels, HgbA1c levels can correlate with quality of care in diabetes. Because of the diabetes impact, the New York City created a HbA1C Registry (NYCAR) to help health providers keep track of patients with diabetes.The NYC Hemoglobin A1C Registry (NYCAR) : Diabetes Prevention and Control Program : NYC DOHMH Another example of disease registry is the New York State CABG Registry that tracks all cardiac bypass surgery performed in the state of New York On a survey of 1040 US physician organizations published in Journal of the American Medical Association, diabetes registries are used by 40.3%, asthma registries are used by 31.2% of physician organizations, CHF registries are used by 34.8% and depression registries are used by 15.7%. Other tests like Pap smears are also useful to keep track in registries because there is evidence that when done annually in women of certain ages groups can detect and prevent cervical cancer. Many of measures tracked are based on evidence-based medicine and are defined and standardized by national organizations like the NCQA. Patient registries are particularly useful for evaluating the safety of orphan drug products as well as the safety of drugs in specific populations. Medical devices registries Countries like Australia, Britain, Norway, Sweden, and America have national a joint replacement registry that track patients with artificial joints. \\"The use of joint registries has proven beneficial abroad. In Australia, regulators use such data to force manufacturers to justify why poorly performing hips or knees should remain available, and products have been withdrawn as a result. In Sweden several years ago, surgeons alerted by their national registry stopped using a badly flawed hip long before their American counterparts did. A few medical organizations in the USA, like Kaiser Permanente, operate their own registries to good effect and the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York has recently set up a registry. Experts say that the United States wastes billions of dollars annually on medical treatments which may not work. But the financial and human consequences are also large when evidence exists but is not collected.\\" Cost-effectiveness The cost-effectiveness of a disease registry is related with the cost-effectiveness of prevention of specific medical conditions. Increasing compliance through a registry with preventive measures like children vaccination or colonoscopy screening can actually be a cost-saving measure. \\"A mammogram every 2 years for women aged 50‚Äì69 costs only about $9,000 per year of life saved. This cost compares favorably with other widely used clinical preventive services.\\" Pay-for-performance (P4P) Registries can be associated with pay-for-performance (P4P) quality based contracts for individual doctors, groups of doctors or even all doctors in a country. For example, the United Kingdom, rewards physicians according to 146 quality measures related with 10 chronic diseases that are tracked electronically. In the United States, Medicare also started a 1.5% P4P contract based on health measures that can be tracked by disease registries. Technical aspects of data tracking The quality of a disease registry is based on the quality of data fed into it and all the processes involved in updating it and keeping its integrity. In every registry there is always a risk of \\"garbage in, garbage out\\". Issues that can affect a registry and its acceptance by a physician group: * Is the registry only updated centrally or can a physician update or correct it? For example, a physician does not want to get reminders from a registry regarding diabetes patients that died, moved to another state or left her/his practice. * Most frequently, a list of patients with a certain condition (e.g. diabetes) is generated based on certain criteria. In the U.S., Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) criteria are set annually by the National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA). These criteria, in order to avoid paper charts reviews are in most cases based on insurance claims. For example, for diabetes, HEDIS selects an eligible population based on Age (18‚Äì75 years), continuous enrollment with a certain health insurer and certain \\"Events/diagnosis\\" from Pharmacy data (electronic), Insurance Claims data (electronic) or from medical records. Pharmacy data is based on a list of medications prescribed for diabetes Claims data is based on having two outpatient visits with a doctor or one inpatient hospital admission or one Emergency Room visit with the diagnosis of diabetes. Patients are excluded if they have polycystic ovaries or just gestational diabetes. Despite the strict criteria it is possible for physicians to have patients on their registries that are not truly diabetic.

It connected the towns of Calgary and Strathcona (also called South Edmonton). Construction started in April 1890 and it opened August 1891. The line was the first major transportation connection for the isolated Edmonton settlement, and the development of the line was responsible for the creation of many railway towns along the line such as Red Deer and Wetaskiwin. Initially, the northern terminus of the line was the old wooden Strathcona train station, a replica of which the Calgary and Edmonton Railway Station Museum operates, until the Edmonton, Yukon and Pacific Railway company was created to run a shortline across the North Saskatchewan River in 1902. In 1907 the new Strathcona Canadian Pacific Railway station became the depot for Strathcona. From 1998 to 2010 the former station housed the Iron Horse Night Club. The line's primary raison d'√™tre was to move in settlers from the east coast to Edmonton where they would congregate at immigration halls and land titles offices before setting out into the rural areas to start homesteads. Some limited export of grain happened from farms near the line, but the real grain boom in the area required the construction of many more branch lines lined with grain elevators. The line was later acquired by the Canadian Pacific Railway, and Strathcona merged with Edmonton in 1912. The line itself still exists, and although train passenger service was discontinued in 1985, the Edmonton Radial Railway Society operates vintage street cars from Old Strathcona across the High Level Bridge to stops south of Jasper Avenue and near the Legislature.

The Rebels surprised and routed the newly formed Loudoun Rangers in their camp at Waterford, capturing nearly the whole unit before subsequently paroling them, thus resulting in a Confederate victory. The action was the first significant partisan fighting in Loudoun County. Background On August 26, Captain Samuel C. Means moved his newly formed command, the independent Loudoun Rangers, to the unionist village of Waterford in Loudoun County, Virginia in preparation to conduct operations against the county's Confederate controlled territory. Means stationed 24 men on picket duty: 4 men on each of the 6 roads leading into the town. He then placed the rest of his command in the local Baptist church before retiring to his residence in the village, placing Lieutenant Luther Slater in nominal command of the unit. Meanwhile, on the 25th, Captain Elijah V. White and his company of cavalry, some 100 strong, was granted permission by Gen. Richard S. Ewell to return to their native county to find forage and harass Federals operating in the county. The following day they reached the southern portion of the county whereupon they learned of the formation of the Loudoun Rangers a month prior and their presence at Waterford. That evening, with about half of his command, White tramped off the main roads through fields and forests to Waterford, evading the Ranger's pickets. The Skirmish In the pre-dawn hours of the 27th, guided by local Confederate sympathizers, White's Rebels approached the Baptists church under cover of darkness to find the 28 Rangers there camped on the porch. Cpt. White decided to split his command in two and sent 30 men, mounted, onto the road as a decoy to draw the Rangers into the open, while the other 20, on foot, waited in the field across the street with orders to fire only after the Rangers took the bait. The anxious Rebels, however, failed to wait and opened fire on the Rangers early causing them to scramble into the refuge of the church, though not before suffering one killed one and two injured, including Lt. Slater who relinquished command to Charles A. Webster. White then sent his decoy force into town to capture Means and the Rangers pickets, while he, with the rest of the command laid siege to the church. In town, the Rebels found that Means and the pickets had fled, but were able to capture two sentries at Means house and a cache of weapons and supplies. 30 minutes into the fight, White sent local resident Mrs. Virts, whose home was adjacent to the Rebels position, across from the church, under a flag of truce to demand the Rangers surrender to which Webster flatly refused. Fighting continued for another hour before White again sent Mrs. Virts into the church to demand surrender, and again Webster refused, this time threatening to kill Mrs. Virts if she entered the church again. Fighting again resumed for another hour and half until 7 a.m. before surrender was demanded for again. With the Rangers out of ammunition, Webster agreed, so long as the prisoners would be immediately paroled. The Rebels too were short on ammunition and White agreed, taking the Rangers horses and weapons and paroling the 19 Rangers captured, the four unaccounted for Rangers had previously escaped by fleeing into the basement and exiting through a window in the back. The two sentries captured outside the church were not paroled and were sent to Richmond as P.O.W.s. During the surrender a member of the Rebels, William Snoots, rushed into the church and attempted to kill his brother, Charles Snoots, who was serving with the Rangers, but was disarmed before accomplishing his task. Results The short fight cost the Rangers 2 killed, and 11 wounded in addition to the 56 horses, and 100 revolvers and carbines taken by the Rebels. It also marked the Ranger's first test of combat and immediately shed light on the lack of drilling and proper command. Means for his part had fled the village with his pickets leaving his command bereft of leadership in their first fight. Means was wanted by the state of Virginia for treason and subject to summary execution if captured. The Rebels who suffered 2 killed, showed lack of discipline in the fight as well but displayed the cunning and initiative against their enemy that would come to characterize the unit throughout the war and earn them the nickname \\"Comanches\\". The fight marked the first of many partisan encounters of Loudouners of divided sentiment on the war.

Records label in 1988. ck was Khan's first album not to be recorded with Arif Mardin, instead it had with the exception of two tracks Russ Titelman at the helm as producer, with whom she had collaborated on hits like \\"Ain't Nobody\\" (1983), \\"Eye to Eye\\" from 1984's platinum-selling I Feel for You as well as \\"Tight Fit\\" from her previous album Destiny. Musically ck combined a variety of genres such as soul, R&B;, funk, pop as well as two jazz titles and altogether the set was more laid-back, less hip- hop influenced and production-wise not as complex and synth-driven as I Feel for You and Destiny. Three singles were released from ck: Womack & Womack's Latino-flavoured \\"It's My Party\\" which reached #5 on Billboard's R&B; Singles chart, \\"Soul Talkin'\\" and \\"Baby Me\\" which reached Top 20 on the R&B; chart, peaking at #12. The ck album itself also charted higher than the preceding Destiny, reaching #17 on the R&B; Albums chart. ck opens with Khan's cover of Stevie Wonder's 1970 hit \\"Signed, Sealed, Delivered I'm Yours\\", again featuring the composer himself on harmonica, just like on \\"I Feel for You\\". One of the two tracks not to be produced by Russ Titelman was the funky and improvisational \\"Sticky Wicked\\", Khan's first proper collaboration with Prince after having covered his \\"I Feel for You\\" in 1984 and turning it into a million-selling hit single. ck also includes a second Prince composition, \\"Eternity\\" (produced by David Frank and Khan herself), and some ten years later Khan and Prince were to team up for a full-length album together, Come 2 My House. ck features one track written and co-produced by Chris Jasper, former member of the Isley Brothers, who was also responsible for writing and producing much of the Isley material from 1973 through 1984 before the Isley Brothers' breakup. Jasper can also be heard singing background with Chaka on \\"Make It Last\\". ck features two recordings of jazz classics that since have become mainstays in Khan's live repertoire, \\"The End of a Love Affair\\", a tribute to Billie Holiday who first recorded the song on her 1958 album Lady in Satin, and Alec Wilder's \\"I'll Be Around\\", the latter with a guest appearance by another legend in the jazz genre, Miles Davis, who in fact also features on the Prince track \\"Sticky Wicked\\". One title from the ck sessions was only released as a single B-side, \\"Everybody Needs Some Love\\" written by former Rufus member David \\"Hawk\\" Wolinski, producer Russ Titelman and Khan herself. ck was transferred from vinyl to CD in 1988 and remains in print.

The song is a homage to the famed lakefront highway in Chicago. Despite the fact that \\"LSD\\" had long been an abbreviation for the Drive, many people thought the song referred to the hallucinogenic drug lysergic acid diethylamide. Numerous fans of the song and residents of Chicago believe the song paints an accurate musical picture of living and driving in downtown Chicago. Lyrics Skip Haynes himself recounts \\"We started recording the song on December 31, 1971 and finished it on New Years Day 1972\\". Despite the fact that lyricist Haynes maintains that the song is not about LSD, the line \\"Just slippin' on by on L.S.D. / Friday night, trouble bound\\" has been construed as a double entendre of both driving on Lake Shore Drive and tripping on the drug. Other references include the lines \\"Pretty blue lights along the way / Helping you right on by,\\" which some think refers to the blue lights of the Chicago Police Department squad cars that patrol Lake Shore Drive. Another theory for the meaning of the \\"blue lights\\" may be the blue lighting of the reversible lanes that used to run down Lake Shore Drive, and have since been removed. \\"From rags on up to riches\\" denoted driving from the south side to the north side. Lyricist Skip Haynes says, \\"I was a north sider so I usually was 'runnin' south on LSD' looking for a good time.\\" Other lyrics in the song illustrate the physical features of the road and its surroundings: \\"It starts up north from Hollywood\\" refers to West Hollywood Avenue, which, running eastbound, becomes Lake Shore Drive, and \\"A ten-minute drive from the Gold Coast back / Makes you sure you‚Äôre pleasure bound\\" refers to the Gold Coast, a strip of affluent residential housing, hotels, university campuses, and office buildings along the Drive. \\"Concrete mountains rearing up / Throwing shadows just about five\\" refers to Chicago's downtown skyscrapers casting their shadows across the Drive as the sun sets in the late afternoon. \\"A ten-minute drive from the Gold Coast back / Makes you sure you‚Äôre pleasure bound\\" is described as \\"The thing to do when going to clubs (Sgt. Peppers, Sitzmark, Barnaby's, Beaver's etc,) on State Street and Rush Street during the late sixties and early seventies was to double (or triple) park in front of the club and go in to hit on the waitresses and listen to the first set from bands like Aliotta Haynes Jeremiah, Aorta, Big Twist, Illinois Speed Press, Mason Proffit, and CTA. When the set was over (the club that inspired the song was Beavers on State Street), one would pile into the car, turn right on Oak Street, turn left at the Drive, shoot the loop at Foster Avenue, then back down to Oak Street, left on State Street, make an illegal U-turn on State and re-double park (with the first ticket you got still under your windshield wiper) in front of Beaver's then go back into the club. This was the perfect amount of time to get high and be peaking just as you walked in and got a drink from the waitress as the band came on for the second set. That's it.\\" Variations When the blizzard of 2011 hit Chicago, many motorists leaving the city were stranded on Lake Shore Drive as weather conditions deteriorated. Within days, Skip Haynes had reworked the lyrics of the song \\"Lake Shore Drive\\" and released it as \\"Snowed on LSD\\". Another variation of the song for the holiday season, \\"Christmas on LSD\\", was also released on Haynes's website, lakeshoredrivemusic.com. Cultural references The song was featured in the 2017 film Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and was further included on the film's soundtrack album.

He wrote about philosophy, history, science, and medicine. He was also a Latin poet and orator. Despite his name, he was not a member of the Carraresi family. Son of Guido, also a humanist and physician, Michele studied Aristotle at the University of Padua, where he earned the title of doctor physicus. As a physician, Michele ministered to the needs of citizens of Bergamo at a time when it was ravaged by plague. He was a friend of Ermolao Barbaro, who criticised insufficient knowledge of Greek. Of Michele's known forty-two works, the Commentaria in Ciceronis Rhetoricam (before 1489) and seventeen others have been lost. In 1457, aged only nineteen, he produced Armiranda, a Latin comedy divided into acts and scenes, classical in form but contemporary political in content. From his university years there are also a series of eighteen epigrams. From two of these it is apparent that Michele saw fellow humanists Giovanni Antonio Pandoni (\\"Porcello\\") and Antonio Beccadelli (\\"Panormita\\") as rivals. De Fato et Fortuna, a prose philosophical treatise on fate and fortune, serves as an overview of his early thought and undergirds much of his later poetry. During this early period he also took to medical writing. De omnibus ingeniis augendae memoriae is a didactic treatise on mnemonic devices. His Ad Gloriosam Virginem Mariam Suarum Calamitatum Commemoratio is an autobiographical poem in rhyming hexameters, recounting his life from infancy to his early thirties. The six Virgilian eclogues of Michele's Bucolicum Carmen are original and authentic, and include one (#2) lamenting the idle dreams which the condottieri induce in rustic youth as they pass by in all their finery. Later he wrote a panegyric for the funeral of the great Bergamasque condottiero Bartolomeo Colleoni, Oratio extemporalis habita in funere Batholomaei Coleonis. In this oration and another, the Oratio de laudibus Gabrielis Rangoni S.R.E. Cardinalis, Michele provides the historian with useful information about contemporary subjects, a mercenary and a Franciscan, Gabriele Rangone. Among his work in natural science, there is De constitutione mundi and the encyclopaedic De choreis musarum sive de origine scientiarum. Michele also wrote a vita of Chiara da Montefalco, whose intercession had helped him in the past and whose intercession he looked forward to in the future. His vita was intended as an improvement upon that of Berengario di Donadio. Michele's most mature writings are probably the fifteen hexametric Sermones objurgatorii, exhortative sermons. Contra hypocrisin malam deals with hypocrisy in the church, most notably the corrupt papal institutions nursed by Sixtus IV. Contra milities segnes is a mocking attack on Roberto Sanseverino d'Aragona and his milities segnes (lazy soldiers), who failed to guard the city of Cividale from the invasion of Matthias Corvinus. De instituenda Filiola was written for the education of his niece Giulia, and De sene alendo on caring for his friend's elderly father. The last is a notable Renaissance work on senility and gerontology. Giovanni Giraldi, after two decades of study, published Michele's surviving works save thirteen in 1967 under the title Opere Scelte. References *Giraldi, Giovanni, ed. and trans. (1967).

Parties consist of three characters who share a single AP gauge which empties as various actions are performed. AP is regenerated at the start of each turn, so using as much AP as possible per turn is important for strategic reasons. Standard fare for the genre such as items, buffs/debuffs, magical and physical attacks, and special acts are present as well. During certain parts of the game the active team may be made up of four members instead of three, though the fourth can only be controlled by the AI. Once the player passes a certain point early on in the story, both the player and the enemy will be able to chain together acts under certain conditions to increase power/effect of that move. For the main protagonist, he is capable of using beasts called Rogress to unleash highly powerful effects at a large AP cost. The game is also compatible with the GameCube Controller, as well as with the Classic Controller. Plot =Summary= Arc Rise Fantasia is set in the world of Fulheim, a fictional large region of Earth. Creatures called \\"Feldragons\\" are causing a lot of trouble as they pass the Meridian Empire in flocks. If one is killed, the resulting explosion poisons the local area. When the empire receives word that a massive horde has its sights on the capital of Diamant, it immediately sends out an army to fight them, including L'Arc, a cool and collected novice mercenary, and his friend Alf, the beloved prince and second in line for the throne. The game is based on political tensions between the Meridian Empire and the Turmelian Republic; a third faction is Olquina, a devoutly-followed coalition at war with the Republic and the Empire. Another central plot point is the game's 2 Laws; Real's Law and Imaginal's Law. A Child of Eesa must choose to present one of two laws that will form the building blocks of the world to the god Eesa. Also, both Real and Imaginal have Divas, who are the priestesses of their religions. =Synopsis= The game opens with the protagonist, Meridian Empire Legionnaire and mercenary L'Arc Bright Lagoon, protecting the army by facing off against a dragon aboard a lightship. The energy of the fight sends him crashing to the Earth, only for him to be saved (and the catalytic explosion of the dragon prevented) by a girl named Ryfia, whose mother was recently assassinated. They proceed to Topazion and later Jada (as it was Ryfia's mother's dying wish for her to go there), during which they meet up with L'Arc's friend, Prince Alfonse (\\"Alf\\") of the Empire. They also come across and recruit Niko Bennex, a grunt member of the army, and assistance is provided to them by a mysterious blue-cloaked man calling himself \\"Rastan\\". The town comes under attack by a monster force of undead skeletons led by a man called the \\"Deathchanter\\", whom Ryfia stated was the one who attacked her hometown and killed her mother. The party of L'Arc, Ryfia, Niko, Alf and Rastan are able to drive away the attacker, who seeks to kill L'Arc (the \\"Child of Eesa\\") and Ryfia (the \\"Imaginal Diva\\"). The standoff results in L'Arc being led to Dragon Prison, where he is able to bond with Simmah, the first Rogress. Rogress are extremely powerful creatures only a Child of Eesa can bond with. Rastan leaves the party afterwards. Unfortunately, as Jada's army general Clyde tells the party, Simmah was a key energy supplier to the Meridian Empire. In the Meridian Capital of Diamant, the emperor Sir Weiss, Alf's brother, pardons them of punishment under the condition they sabotage an Olquinian ray stream that siphons the empire's energy (Olquina is a fanatical country that preaches Real's Law). While in Diamant, L'Arc sees his mother Elena and his mentor Zamuel; the party also meets Adele, L'Arc and Alf's childhood friend, as well as Zamuel's granddaughter. Since the Deathchanter is spotted on the Olquinian ship the party looked to infiltrate, they will need to find an alternate method of transport. As Zamuel's martial arts school is attacked, an energetic young girl named Cecille delivers a message to Elena that Zamuel's friend \\"Leon\\" has tracked an old enemy on a coastline. Zamuel and Adele chase the thieves. The party finds Zamuel wounded; Rastan and Cecille appear and escort him back to Diamant. In the coastline cave, the group finds the corpses of many bandits killed by Paula and Luna, assassins working under \\"Ignacy\\" (the \\"old enemy\\" mentioned in the message). The duo, upon their attempt to execute Adele, are countered by L'Arc's party. However, thanks to the efforts of Serge (the last surviving bandit and a rather kind-hearted man), they are all able to escape the cave safely. On the boat, the creature that relayed the message to Zamuel is revealed to be a Kopin, whom Serge's bandit group had been stealing. Via the boat, the party goes to Kopin Village and then escapes a dangerous nearby jungle. Fortunately, this chain of events has led L'Arc to being closer to Olquina than before, so he continues with his mission as planned. On his way there, the group encounters a provocative young woman named Leslie, who hints to a future alliance. Apparently, the Olquinian Diva Ms Rafil had recently been killed by an unknown assassin, leaving her unknown daughter as the current Diva, and spiking anti-Meridian sentiment in the Olquina capital of Antrax. Upon their arrival in the capital of Olquina, Antrax, the party infiltrates its Skywalk and disables it. The Deathchanter appears and unsuccessfully attempts to counterattack the group, surprised to see Adele with them. Shortly afterwards, the party allies with Leslie after Adele is kidnapped by Olquinian forces. The group fights through to catch up with her. Once they do so, they discover that in reality, Adele has now become the Real Diva, as Ms Rafil was her mother. Zamuel's mercenary force were asked by Rafil to take care of her daughter, until such time that she was ready to learn her true fate. The Deatchanter is also there, overlooking her as she sings a song of Real. As tensions begin to climb, Weiss brutally attacks Olquina, announcing the success of L'Arc's sabotage of the energy siphoning device in the Skywalk. In the rage following this, it is revealed that Alf is also a Child of Eesa capable of controlling Rogress. Girtab, the Rogress protective of Olquina, begins to obey Alf and Adele. Weiss attempts to kill Adele, but is countered by Alf. L'Arc breaks up the fight as the brothers cross swords. Alf, infuriated at Weiss's attack on Olquina, commits to staying with Adele, abandoning L'Arc, Weiss and the Empire. Serge and Leslie also migrate, revealed to be mercenaries hired to protect the Real Diva. Alf, Adele, the Deathchanter, Serge and Leslie all flee with Girtab, leaving L'Arc with Ryfia and Niko. Weiss reveals he declared the attack on Antrax to attempt to turn it into a military base in an act of aggression. He then explains the story of how Eesa created both Real and Imaginal, with a \\"Child of Eesa\\" (either L'Arc or Alf) having to choose which of two laws to present. L'Arc and Ryfia chose Imaginal, and Adele and Alf chose Real. He orders L'Arc to deliver a message to General Freya in Turmelia, the Senate for the Republic. Unfortunately, Zamuel, due to Ignacy's assault on him earlier, has died. Before embarking, Cecille offers to join the trio on their mission. Falsely believed to be responsible for the attack on Antrax, Niko, L'Arc, Ryfia and Cecille are arrested in the Republic, but due to Rastan rejoining them on the way, they escape the prison. Later, L'Arc consults Patriarch Hosea who explains that Real's Law is a school of thought that proposes the death of all living things, whilst Imaginal's Law proposes prosperity and continuation. L'Arc must collect all of the Rogress before Alf does, as they are necessary to present a Law to Eesa. They then receive a map indicating the Rogress locations; the closest one is up north in the region of Ebur. During their trip there, the party encounters and faces a monster summoned by the Deathchanter, who reveals his name to be Dynos. He is the brother of Cecille, and the two are members of the Divine Race, a subset of humans who slept in a time-stopping chamber for around a millennium. Cecille is older than Dynos, but Dynos woke up before Cecille. Rastan has a vested interest in encountering Serge that he keeps secretive about. The party spots Alf giving a rally raising his popularity in Batrachites as Alf obtains Absin, the next Rogress. There, it is revealed that along with Serge, Dynos and Leslie, General Clyde has joined his cause. In Ebur Ruins, where Gula reportedly is, the group encounters Alf's group face- to-face, but they all agree to work cooperatively temporarily so that they can locate Maria, a resident of Ebur village missing in the ruins. Upon saving her, Serge breaks away from Alf's group and permits L'Arc (without Alf's approval) to bond with Gula. After Maria is saved, Serge peacefully leaves the village; he tips the party off about a Lightship in Jada. After bypassing a border between Meridia and the Republic, the party then battles Alf, Adele and Leslie over control of the Rogress Rufunga (this battle can be won or lost by the player, winning rewards the player much EXP and grants the player Rufunga). Upon returning to Jada to get the Lightship, Weiss, previously unaware that the group survived their imprisonment at Turmelia attacks the group. He escapes as the party obtains the Lightship. Upon its crash, the party hires a man in Ebur to repair it. On their way to a nearby abandoned church that has the necessary parts in it, the party encounters Serge alone, who is investigating atrocities committed by Ignacy's task force, the Aion Unit. He joins the party after Ignacy attacks and defeats the party. They barely escape with the now-repaired Lightship after being narrowly saved by Leslie. It is now revealed that in reality, Serge (the real \\"Leon\\"), Rastan, Zamuel and L'Arc's father Rex were the 4 members of the Lord Knights, and that Ignacy killed Rastan's wife and child after forcing Rastan to betray Rex to Ignacy. Rastan offers to kill himself to give Rex's son satisfaction, but L'Arc permits him to live, Rex's last words to Leon (Serge) urging an abstinence from revenge. Both teams having 2 Rogress (L'Arc's with Simmah/Gula and Alf's with Girtab/Absin), the party races against Alf's to collect all 9 Rogress; the 4 remaining are Squill, in the Soliton Caves; Urgula, in the Ellgode Volcano; Papirusagu, in the Zeifellt Holy Tower; and Banchu, in the Ruins of Hillbert. The locations correspond respectively to the Water, Fire, Wind and Earth elements. The order the player pursues the Rogress can be changed. The player will have three opportunities to hunt a Rogress down if they didn't get Rufunga, 2 if they did. Due to Alf's competition with L'Arc, each location will have a condition the player must use to obtain the Rogress in addition to defeating the Rogress; for instance, Papirusagu requires the player beat Alf to the top of the tower in a race. None of the Rogress need to be defeated to complete their dungeon (they will simply go to L'Arc). After their first attempt at a Rogress, the northern ice city of Opalus is attacked. This chain of events leads to the city being saved, with Leslie revealed to be one of its former commanders. After another pursuit of a Rogress (two if the player didn't get Rufunga), Leslie's sister Angie is falsely imprisoned. The party saves her before she is executed, once again defeating Ignacy's assassins Paula and Luna in the process. Finally, Leslie joins L'Arc's party as thanks for their assistance, but returning to the Lightship after this, Niko leaves the group, unable to deal with the situation. During this time, Weiss agrees to a peace treaty between the Empire and the Republic. At this time, Weiss reveals that he is the half-brother of L'Arc (he shares L'Arc's mother and Alf's father). Meridian soldiers attack the meeting and sabotage it, and the party identifies that these are soldiers who were killed and controlled by Dynos, and that he and Adele are doing this behind Alf and Clyde's backs. A furious Alf, unaware of the true culprit, confronts Weiss aboard the Flagship Percival. Fearing that one of the brothers may end up dead, L'Arc's party intervenes to find Weiss and Alf dueling. In a moment of distraction upon Weiss knocking Adele aside, Alf pierces his sword through Weiss's heart. Adele reveals that she used Dynos to manipulate Alf into getting revenge on Weiss for his attack on Antrax, and in order to give Alf the throne so that he can use it to preach Real's Law. Due to the Flagship's destruction, the parties exit the ship. Before his death, Weiss leaves L'Arc's party with a clue; they must neutralize and keep the Hozone (the poison affecting the Divine and Common Race) to make it suitable for all life forms, and they should use a \\"Doctor Carlisle\\" for assistance. Shortly afterwards, the party goes to Hosea, but catches Ignacy speaking with him, revealing that Hosea is complicit in the Aion Unit's atrocities. Ignacy attempts to brainwash L'Arc and nullify him as the Child of Eesa. Ryfia uses her power to intervene, but she is knocked unconscious and kidnapped in the process. Simmah tells L'Arc that if they look to save her, they need go to the Ancient Tower Zeifellt. There, they learn that Rogress are created from humans, and upon investigating Ryfia's consciousness in person, it is revealed that Simmah is the father of Ryfia, and he became a Rogress to protect the Republic. Recovering Ryfia, the party discovers that there is now an anti-Alf resistance movement, and the party defeats General Clyde, who reveals his hesitation in the plan motivated out of loyalty. He confides that Alf plans to use Adele to activate Ellgode Volcano, which would kill countless people. The resistance movement stems from how Alf has become extremely dictatorial. They confront Alf at Ellgode and stop him from triggering the volcano. During this time, Alf reveals that he has made a pact with Real; if he can manage people for a year, Real will stop the destruction of the land, and he is trying to reduce the number of people on the Earth making their management efficient. Exiting the volcano, they encounter Niko, who directs them to the Soliton Caves where they can find Doctor Carlisle). Carlisle advises them that there might be a way to save both races independent of the laws by defeating Eesa and neutralizing all the Hozone. In the midst of a battle between Alf's party and L'Arc's, Ignacy arrives and warns them to get to the Lascarde Skywalk before Niko is killed. There the party defeats both Ignacy and Hosea. Adele sacrifices herself to save Alf from being killed by Ignacy, and Niko sacrifices himself to prevent the Skywalk from launching a deadly blast on the surface world. Alf loses all hope following Adele's death, and becomes rash. The party goes to the Verct Skywalk and defeats Dynos, with Cecille choosing to fight him - discontent with his motives vs L'Arc's, who then attempts to transform into a dragon to counter the party. Cecille kills Dynos to prevent this. After defeating Clyde and Alf, who agree to unify to defeat Real again and the latter returning to L'Arc all the Rogress, L'Arc goes to the Holy Land of Noire to confront the god Eesa. Before he does, L'Arc revisits Doctor Carlisle‚Äîshe acknowledges that saving the world is possible, but advises L'Arc that he would need to be put to a 500-year time-stopping sleep in order to do so. The party defeats Eesa, and after her defeat, the story ends with L'Arc going to sleep for centuries and waking 500 years later. Receiving messages from all of his (now-deceased) friends, he finds that Ryfia went to sleep with him to be able to meet him again. The game ends as L'Arc and Ryfia exit into the world. After the epilogue, the game reverts the player back to the point immediately before the final boss, with new side content available. Music The music in the game was composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, Shunsuke Tsuchiya and Yuki Harada. The opening theme is Negai Hoshi by Nami Tamaki, and the ending theme is Tenshi no Hashigo ~crepuscular rays~ by Yui Makino. The soundtrack album is released on 3 March 2010 which contains 3 disk. The soundtracks are composed and arranged by Yasunori Mitsuda, Shunsuke Tsuchiya, Yuki Harada, Yoko Shimomura and also Ryfia's Japanese voice actress, Yui Makino. The album not only contains BGMs in the game, but also the songs that Ryfia and Adele usually sing, which are sung by their voice actresses Yui Makino (Ryfia) and Emiri Kato. The ending song for the game, Tenshi no Hashigo, is also included in the 3rd disk of the album. Track listing Track listing Track listing At disk 3, a piano piece called Awakening, To A World Protected is the piano version of Tenshi no Hashigo, which was played and composed by Yui Makino. The lyrics and music for Tenshi no Hashigo are composed by Yui Makino as well. Development The game had previously been titled as Project Ray, and was known to exist as early as September 4, 2007. As Project Ray, it was also shown to exist with Sands of Destruction for the Nintendo DS. The game was unveiled on June 25, 2008 in the popular Japanese magazine Famits≈´. Hiroyuki Kanemaru, the director of Fantasia, previously worked at Telenet Japan and later moved to Namco Tales Studio, where he worked as scenario script director and level concept designer on Tales of Symphonia. Kanemaru stated that Project Ray would be influenced by old-school RPGs from systems such as the TurboGrafx-16. It is Imageepoch's first game not developed for a handheld game console. The game was later released under Nintendo's \\"Everyone‚Äôs Recommendation Selection\\" of budget titles in Japan. Reception and sales The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic; the game's turn-based battle gameplay (something of a rarity for the Wii) was praised whilst the game's tendency to stick to established JRPG formulas were criticized. Proponents of the game, such as Nintendo Power, cited that the game's strong points overshadowed its faults. The English localization of the game received criticism directed towards its technical problems, but it is somewhat infamous for its voice acting which is criticized by many as being lazy. In Japan, Famitsu gave it a score of all four eights for a total of 32 out of 40. Arc Rise Fantasia was also the fourth best-selling game in Japan during the week of its release at 26,000 copies. Approximately 21,000 copies were sold in the first week following its North American release.

Church Complex is a series of several buildings located on Buffalo's historic East Side within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Buffalo. The complex contains the Kolbe Center, Sears Street Hall, Rectory, Convent and the huge sandstone church that towers over the neighborhood. The complex school was closed in 1982 and has been razed. History Corpus Christi was the seventh Polish parish established in Buffalo. The Church was founded by Fr. Hyacinth Fudzinski, a Franciscan friar from Czarnk√≥w, Poland. The church was established to serve the religious needs of the growing Polish community of the East Side. The church community grew in the early 20th century as immigrants poured into the neighborhood. Note: This includes and Accompanying eight photographs The church has suffered the problems that have plagued other inner-city churches across America the past 30 years. As parishioners moved to the suburbs, the church became increasingly empty during masses and the school was closed in the early 1980s. Building Completed in 1907, Corpus Christi's imposing facade is wrought of Hummelstown brownstone quarried in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania.Nomination form for the National Register of Historic Places, page 3Hummelstown Brownstone booklet page 44 The church has 3 large bells, all in the north tower. The largest bell dates to 1898, the smaller bells were installed in 1948. All were cast by the Meneely Bell Foundry in Troy, NY. The crosses atop the towers were filled with letters from the parish's school children before they were affixed to the cupolas. The original church windows were made by Franz Mayer works in Munich, Germany. Present day In June 2003, the Franciscan Friars decided that they could no longer administer to the community due to financial and other concerns. This announcement led to the creation of a committee named \\"The Friends of Corpus Christi\\", who sought to find another order to lead the faithful. This search yielded results when the Pauline Fathers agreed to take over the Church property and continue the rich heritage. The Paulines currently have two priests and one brother administering to the parish community. The current Pastor is Fr. Anselm Chalupka. The Complex was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007.

They were later to become the Harel Brigade of the Israeli army. The village was surrounded by five companies with ambushes being set on the roads to Ramallah, Nabi Samuel and Biddu. A group consisting of armoured cars, a Davidka, reserves and the operation's HQ approached from Jerusalem. The company approaching from Castel encountered a group of around 30 armed men leaving Beit Surik heading east but did not engage them. A short mortar barrage was launched on the village from the east. When one of the ambush groups was fired on they attacked and took the school building. The village was taken soon afterwards with the attackers only encountering sparse rifle fire. Three platoons went through the village clearing enemy positions while a detachment of sappers began demolishing buildings. Some of the brigade then went on to capture Biddu before daybreak.Allon, 1970, pp. 193-195 They left Beit Surik largely or partly destroyed.Morris, 2004, p. 345 note #21, p. 296Morris, 2004, p. 346 note #26, p. 297 In the wake of the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, and after the 1949 Armistice Agreements, Beit Surik came under Jordanian rule.

The International Court held that Israel is under an obligation to discontinue building the Wall and to dismantle it forthwith. In its Advisory Opinion, the Court dismissed a number of legal arguments raised by Israel relating to the applicability of humanitarian law and human rights law. In particular the International court held that Israeli settlements were unlawful.

The College was founded in 1856 and opened in 1858 as the diocesan college of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Cloyne. Archbishop Thomas Croke, after whom Croke Park is named, became the school's first President in this year. The College is renowned for its sporting history.  History  The site upon which St. Colman's was built was bought by Fr. Timothy Murphy in 1856. Murphy commissioned John Pine Hurley to design the new College building. Twenty months after construction began, St. Colman's opened its doors to its first students in 1858. The original College building is three storeys in height and boasts an impressive six-storey tower. The facade of red sandstone with limestone facings. The building, with its tall tower, has since become an iconic structure in Fermoy and looms over the town's skyline. A west wing was added in 1887 while the school chapel was added in the early 1900s. A new classroom block was added to the College in 1969. This new block boasted a large assembly hall and twenty-two classrooms. A library in the College, known among the students and faculty as the Priest's Library, houses many rare manuscripts and books. From the very beginning, St. Colman's welcomed boarders from all over Munster; however, boarding ceased in the College in 2003. Sport The College has a strong hurling tradition and has won the Dr. Harty Cup nine times (1948, 1949, 1977, 1992, 1996, 1997, 2001, 2002 & 2003). Today all teams are represented by local club players. Today the sport is as strong as ever but the College also has a much more diverse sporting ethos. The College has successful in competition with sports as diverse as equestrian, pitch and putt, tennis, rugby (former Leinster and Ireland prop Mike Ross being a past pupil), cricket, basketball, and badminton in recent years. The St. Colman's Health & Fitness Campus, a huge redevelopment of the College's sports grounds, was opened in 2015. The project included the building of brand new dressing rooms and showers, three full sized tennis courts and a fitness walkway around the Harty pitch.

Emma Henry, an iron-hulled sidewheel steamer, was captured at sea in December 1864 attempting to run the Union blockade of the Confederacy. The United States Navy purchased her from the New York prize court on 13 January 1865 and commissioned her into naval service on 11 May. At Norfolk, Virginia, Emma Henry joined the squadron commanded by Acting Rear Admiral Sylvanus W. Godon, which had been established to search for the Confederate ironclad ram CSS Stonewall. Emma Henry departed Hampton Roads with the rest of the squadron on 17 May. On 22 May, she carried Acting Rear Admiral Godon into Charleston harbor in South Carolina to confer with Rear Admiral John A. Dahlgren before the squadron continued on its way. During that interlude, she collided with another ship and, after returning Godon to his flagship , headed north for repairs at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. On 13 June, while undergoing repairs, she was renamed USS Wasp. As soon as she completed repairs, the ship rejoined Rear Admiral Godon's squadron, designated the Brazil Squadron and based at Rio de Janeiro. The original reason for the squadron's dispatch, Stonewall, had long since ceased to pose a problem; the former Confederate ironclad had surrendered to Spanish authorities in Cuba on 19 May just as Wasp had begun her repairs at Philadelphia. Thus, she and her squadron-mates took up a different duty, watching out for American interests in South America and along the eastern coast of Africa. Wasp left Africa to her larger sisters while she concentrated upon the vicinity of the Rio de la Plata and Uruguay River during the war between Paraguay and the coalition of Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay which had begun when the Paraguayan President, Francisco Solano L√≥pez, invaded Brazil on 26 December 1864. The war lasted until mid-1870, peace coming only after the complete reduction of Paraguay and the death of Lopez at the hands of Brazilian lancers following a protracted guerrilla campaign. In the meantime, Wasp patrolled the area to protect Americans and their interests in the combat zone. As frequently on the rivers in the interior as she was at sea, she ascended Rio de La Plata and its tributaries, the Uruguay, Paran√°, and Paraguay Rivers. After the war ended in June 1870, Wasp continued to operate out of Montevideo in Uruguay on the aforementioned rivers, ascending them as far as Asunci√≥n, Paraguay. Her duty consisted of transporting diplomats and generally watching out for American interests. She continued to be so employed until surveyed early in 1876 when she was found to be unfit for further naval service. Decommissioned that same spring, Wasp was sold to Mr. L. B. Scheiner of Montevideo on 5 June 1876.

During their events including diversity- training sessions and antihomophobia workshops, they passed out magnets with an inverted pink triangle, \\"ACT UP's...symbol\\", surrounded by a green circle to \\"symbolize universal acceptance,\\" and asked \\"allies to display the magnets to show support for gay rights and to designate their work spaces free from homophobia.\\" Advocates for Youth states on their website that a safe-space is \\"A place where anyone can relax and be fully self-expressed, without fear of being made to feel uncomfortable, unwelcome or challenged on account of biological sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, cultural background, age, or physical or mental ability; a place where the rules guard each person's self-respect, dignity and feelings and strongly encourage everyone to respect others.\\" However, some people consider safe space culture as a violation of the First Amendment and a mechanism for retreating from opinions which contrast with one's own. In general, these may be individuals or institutions which support a safe space for LGBT students and employees. They may offer or mandate staff training on diversity, include being a safe space in the organization's mission statement, develop and post a value statement in the organization's office, online, or on printed documents, or, if part of a coalition, encourage the coalition to include being a safe space in its mission and values. Criticism The idea of safe spaces has been criticized on the grounds that it stifles freedom of speech. It has also been criticized for blurring the line between security against physical harm, and giving offense.Trigger Warning: Safe Spaces Are Dangerous (debate) In response, advocates for safe spaces point out that people in certain groups that object to hate speech are directly affected by it.Free Speech Controversy Erupts At Middlebury College Writing for The New York Times in 2015, journalist Judith Shulevitz distinguished between meetings where participants mutually consent to provide a safe space, and attempts to make entire dormitories or student newspapers safe spaces. According to Shulevitz, the latter is a logical consequence of the former: \\"Once you designate some spaces as safe, you imply that the rest are unsafe. It follows that they should be made safer.\\" She gave the example of a safe space at Brown University, when libertarian Wendy McElroy, who was known for criticizing the term \\"rape culture\\" was invited to give a speech: \\"The safe space ... was intended to give people who might find comments 'troubling' or 'triggering,' a place to recuperate. The room was equipped with cookies, coloring books, bubbles, Play- Doh, calming music, pillows, blankets and a video of frolicking puppies, as well as students and staff members trained to deal with trauma.\\" In 2015, journalist Conor Friedersdorf criticized the use of outdoor safe spaces to block press coverage of student protests. According to Friedersdorf, such uses reverse the intent of safe spaces: \\"This behavior is a kind of safe-baiting: using intimidation or initiating physical aggression to violate someone's rights, then acting like your target is making you unsafe.\\" In 2015, then- president of the United States Barack Obama critiqued the concept of safe spaces as promoting intellectual disinterest: \\"Anybody who comes to speak to you and you disagree with, you should have an argument with ‚Äòem. But you shouldn‚Äôt silence them by saying, 'You can‚Äôt come because I'm too sensitive to hear what you have to say.' That‚Äôs not the way we learn either.\\" In 2016, British actor and writer Stephen Fry criticized safe spaces and trigger warnings as infantilizing students and possibly eroding free speech. Frank Furedi of the Los Angeles Times and Candace Russell of HuffPost have similarly stated that safe spaces contribute to echo chambers surrounded by like-minded people, insulating those inside said chambers from ideas that challenge or contradict their own. Other known speakers who have criticized the concept of safe spaces include Christina Hoff SommersArnold, Tyler (October 14, 2016). \\"Safe spaces a 'recipe for fanaticism,' Hoff Sommers claims\\". Campus Reform. and Steven Crowder.Howerton, Jason (April 26, 2016). \\"Comedian Steven Crowder Dishes Out Brutal, Nearly 5-Minute ‚ÄòReality Check‚Äô to ‚ÄòSocial Justice Warriors‚Äô When They Interrupt Event\\". TheBlaze. The Atlantic reported in 2016 that safe spaces were considered by some to be re-segregation.DeRuy, Emily. \\"The Fine Line Between Safe Space and Segregation\\" The Atlantic, August 17, 2016. In 2016, the University of Chicago sent a letter welcoming new undergraduates, affirming its commitment to diversity, civility, and respect and informing them the college does not support trigger warnings, does not cancel controversial speakers, and does not \\"condone the creation of intellectual 'safe spaces' where individuals can retreat from thoughts and ideas at odds with their own\\".University Of Chicago Tells Freshmen It Does Not Support 'Trigger Warnings'Students were directed to https://freeexpression.uchicago.edu/ for more information. Despite the criticisms, there are some academics who have defended safe spaces practises. Chris Waugh, a PhD student at the University of Manchester, draws on the work of Jurgen Habermas and Nancy Fraser to argue that safe spaces are not censorious or impinging on free speech, but are \\"subaltern counterpublics\\" - that is, alternative discursive arenas where vulnerable groups can reconfigure and reframe their experiences of the dominant, public sphere, with the ultimate aim of returning to the public sphere better armed to combat their own oppression. Safe spaces are, therefore, \\"represent an often clumsy‚Äîbut still vital‚Äîattempt to create counterpublics for marginalised groups. These counterpublics serve two purposes; firstly, they provide spaces for groups to recuperate, reconvene, and create new strategies and vocabularies for resistance. Secondly, the presence of these counterpublics makes visible collective and individual traumas which disrupt neoliberal narratives of self- resilience.\\" In popular culture \\"Safe Space\\", a 2015 episode of the animated comedy series South Park, parodied the concept of safe- spaces.Caffrey, Dan (October 22, 2015). \\"The cake metaphor comes back on another solid episode of South Park\\". The A.V. Club. \\"Safe Space\\" is also the name of a proposed hero(ine) from Marvel comics, who assists the New Warriors in their most recent incarnation alongside their sibling, \\"Snowflake\\", both non-binary. Snowflake possesses ice-based abilities similar to Iceman of the X-Men while Safe Space possesses the ability to generate reactive, defensive force fields that can only protect others, not themselves . While criticized by some as seeming mocking the idea is apparently still going forward.

The first seeds of what would later become an abiding interest in farm demonstration were planted after he became active in an organization called \\"The Teachers of Agriculture,\\" attending their meetings at the Michigan Agricultural College in 1881 and the Iowa Agricultural College in 1882. Knapp was so impressed with this teaching method that he drafted a bill for the establishment of experimental research stations, which later was introduced to the 47th Congress, laying the foundation for a nationwide network of agricultural experiment stations. Knapp later served as the second president of Iowa Agricultural College from 1883 to 1884,, Iowa State University, retrieved 2009-01-27 but his interest in agricultural demonstration work did not occur until 1886, when he moved to Louisiana and began developing a large tract of agricultural land in the western part of this state. He founded Vinton, Louisiana, naming the town after his hometown Vinton, Iowa. The boll weevil inflicted immense suffering on southern farmers after it entered the United States in 1892. Its steady onslaught on southern cotton fields sparked an interest in farm demonstrations as a way to show farmers how to deal with the pest most effectively. This, in turn, provided the foundations for formal Cooperative Extension work, which followed in 1914.Knapp could neither persuade local farmers to adopt the techniques he had perfected on his farm nor enlist farmers from the North to move to the region to serve collectively as a sort of educational catalyst. What he could do, he reasoned, was to provide incentives for farmers to settle in each township with the proviso that each, in turn, would demonstrate to other farmers what could be done by adopting his improved farming methods. The concept worked. Northern farmers began moving into the region, and native farmers began buying into Knapp's methods. By 1902, Knapp was employed by the government to promote good agricultural practices in the South. Based on his own experience, Knapp was convinced that demonstrations carried out by farmers themselves were the most effective way to disseminate good farming methods. His efforts were aided by the onslaught of the boll weevil, a voracious cotton pest whose presence was felt not only in Louisiana but also throughout much of the South. Damage associated with this pest instilled fear among many merchants and growers that the cotton economy would disintegrate around them. In the view of many, a farm demonstration at the Walter G. Porter farm, now a National Historic Landmark in Terrell, Texas, set up by the Department of Agriculture at the urging of concerned merchants and growers, was the first in a series of steps that eventually led to passage of the legislation that formalize Cooperative Extension work. USDA officials were so impressed with the success of this demonstration that they appropriated $250,000 to combat the weevil ‚Äî a measure that also involved the hiring of farm demonstration agents. By 1904, some 20 agents were employed in Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The movement also appeared to be spreading to neighboring Mississippi and Alabama.Smith, Jack D., \\"Information and Inspiration: An Early History of the Alabama Cooperative Extension System,\\" Unpublished Manuscript, March 29, 1989. pp. 13-16. Knapp is commemorated in Washington, D.C. by a bridge linking the U.S. Department of Agriculture Administration Building to the U.S. Department of Agriculture South Building across Independence Avenue. He is interred at Iowa State University Cemetery, Ames, Story, Iowa, USA, (see 'find-a-grave; Seaman Asahel Knapp').

Knapp in 1903. The project successfully demonstrated methods expanding crop production. From this foundation project developed the U.S. Department of Agriculture Agricultural Extension Service. The property was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964, and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Knapp worked with Walter Porter to set aside of the farm, on which the experimental use of fertilizers on some plots and rotation with nitrogen-fixing legumes doubled normal yields of cotton. Porter had been selected by the community to participate in the project, with $1000 set aside to cover potential losses. Porter profited from the experiment, and the money was unused. The success of this project led to the creation of government Extension Service programs, which went on to develop methods to combat boll weevil infestation in the area.

B. polaris is one of two bumblebees that live above the Arctic Circle. The other is its social parasite Bombus hyperboreus. B. polaris is a social bee that can survive at near freezing temperatures. It has developed multiple adaptations to live in such cold temperatures. B. polaris has a thicker coat of hair than most bees, utilizes thermoregulation, and makes insulated nests.  Taxonomy and phylogeny  Bombus polaris is part of the family Apidae, which is part of the larger class of Insecta. Apidae is the largest family of bees, including several species of bees used by humans for honey consumption. B. polaris is part of the subgenus Alpinobombus along with Bombus alpinus, Bombus balteatus, Bombus hyperboreus, and Bombus neoboreus. Alpinobombus bees occur in arctic and high alpine regions. It is of the Bombini tribe, which feeds on pollen or nectar.  Description and identification  = Appearance (General) = Bombus polaris has a thicker coat of hair than temperate bees in order to slow heat loss. Although the coloration of this bee is variable, the thorax is usually black with orange-yellow edges, while most of the abdomen is orange- yellow with a black tip. B. polaris also has a higher abdominal temperature than its temperate cousins. = Appearance (Workers) = The variation in the color of the pubescence is noticeable variable. The pubescence of the apical dorsal abdominal segments varies from deep rust color to a dull yellow color. There is also a considerable variation in the size of the workers. Some can be scarcely 10 mm in length, while others can be much larger. = Thermoregulation = Additionally, B. polaris has a bio-mechanical method of bringing its body to a much higher abdominal temperature than its temperate relatives. The ability of B. polaris to fly in deep cold is due to a process called thermoregulation, which allows it to raise its internal body temperature to temperatures as high as 38 ¬∞C.Sutton, A. The Brief Busy Life of the Arctic Bumblebee. Alaska Fish and Wildlife News, June 2012. For this reason B. polaris is likely to outcompete any temperate bumblebee species that might seek to expand to the northern range.  Nests  The nests are heavily insulated, which is an important factor in the bees‚Äô energy conservation in the harsh polar environment. At the start of the colony cycle, the lone queen maintains a nest temperature of about 25-30 ¬∞C However, when she makes foraging trips at frequent intervals, the temperature of the nest will decline. At an air temperature of 10 ¬∞C, the nest temperature generally does not decline more than 7 ¬∞C in the half hour that the queen is foraging. After all of the sixteen to seventeen larvae of the first brood have developed into workers, the nest temperature is maintained at a steady 35 ¬∞C, and the comings and going of the queen and other foragers does not appear to affect the nest temperature. The nest of Bombus polaris also appears to have a higher nest temperature than those of honeybees and bumblebees from temperate climates. = Nest structure = First, a fertilized queen must locate a suitable nesting site. After this, she will build a cell to hold the food and provisions, and then a hatch camera to house her offspring. B. polaris queens will use a mixture of pollen and wax to build these initial structures. First the hatch camera will be constructed, followed shortly afterwards by the construction of a wax base. On top of this base, the queen will deposit a dust clump, which she will have covered in flower nectar. This will be ringed by a wax roller. She will then lay her eggs into the clump, pour them with a dust mixture, and then cover it with a wax membrane. Distribution and habitat This bumblebee has a wide circumpolar distribution, found in Canada, Arctic Alaska, Arctic islands (Devon Island, Ellesmere Island, Baffin Island and Greenland), northern Scandinavia and across Arctic Russia (Nenets, Yamalo- Nenets, Sakha and Chukotka). As of 2015, B. polaris is common and is not listed as endangered. Bombus polaris is an alpine species. They exclusively live at the summits of mountains. This clear separation between alpine species and subalpine species may be due to superior competition from the subalpine species, leading to a suboptimal habitat occupation of the alpine species. An alternative explanation is that the alpine bee species possess both the ability and body type to survive the colder temperatures, which naturally separates the two types of bees into distinct ecological territories. Alpine species usually have a larger body length in comparison to subalpine species. Colony cycle = Colony initiation = A Bombus polaris queens hibernate for about nine months, suspended in an almost lifeless state in a mouse nest or some other burrow. She will wait for the ground to warm. After this, B. polaris fertilized queens emerge from hibernation, visiting flowers and looking for areas to build potential nests. This signals the start of the seasonal cycle of development. Recently started colonies can be found in June or July. = Colony growth = B. polaris is a social bee that requires a completion of at least two generations every year. To make up for this short amount of time, the queens produce many workers per generation. The initial brood is a clutch of around twenty larvae that emerge in about ten days. Arctic bumblebee larvae grow fast, and will experience a near tropical environment due to the heat production of their queen, and later on, of the workers. Arctic bumblebees have a larger initial brood as an adaptation to speed up the colony cycle in the very short growing season. Since the queen has time to produce only a few broods, she must also lay very large egg clutches. The life cycle is sped up by incubating the eggs internally that are already in the abdomen, thus increasing the rate of egg production and egg growth.  Behavior  = Foraging = Bombus polaris is one of the few bumblebee species where the queen will continue to forage while some workers have already emerged in the nest. She divides her time between incubating her brood and regulating the temperature of the nest to leaving the nest to forage. The food reserves gathered in the day are generally sufficient for only one night. When the bees exhaust their food, they enter torpor and cease to incubate. Occasional periods of semi-starvation lasting for a day or two do not harm the colony. The bees simply become drowsy and remain in a state of suspended animation.  Life history and survivorship curves  = Colonies = The colony begins in the summer in June. The colony is only able to survive for two or three months until winter hits again. All workers, drones, and most females die with the colony. = Workers = The queen‚Äôs first brood after the start of the colony will develop into worker bees ‚Äì small sterile females who will enlarge the nest, forage, and tend to the next generation of bees. Worker bees will die along with the colony at the beginning of winter. = Queens = The queen is the sole survivor of her colony after 9 months of hibernation during the winter. In the Arctic, only one queen per colony on average will survive the winter to renew the next life cycle. The colony only has one or two months to complete the social cycle of two generations. The old queen dies with her progeny. = Males = The queen‚Äôs second brood in late summer include male drones and fertile females who are candidates for next year‚Äôs queen. The drone‚Äôs sole function is to fertilize the females, but most females will die along with the drones at the beginning of winter.  Interaction with other species  = Diet = Large zygomorphic flowers of Pedicularis are dependent on B. polaris. B. polaris works the spikes of Pedicularis upwards from the bottom. Through this behavior, the adaption of gustatory organs to sugar is offset by the increasing concentration of sugars in the nectar up the spike. This behavior is also significantly related to pollination. = Predators = Predators of Bombus polaris include the Buff- breasted sandpiper (Tryngites subruficollis), common eider (Somateria mollissima), and Long-tailed duck (Clangula hyemalis), which will either eat the bees or feed them to their young. = Parasites = Bombus hyperboreus habitually takes over the nests of Bombus polaris. Because of the short Arctic summer, B. polaris normally has time to produce only one brood of workers before the colony has to raise queens. When B. hyperboreus takes over the nest, all of her young are raised as queens by the B. polaris workers. Thus, B. hyperboreus workers are not produced and pollen collectors are never seen.  Human importance  Due to its cold tolerance the Bombus polaris appears to be one of the earliest pollinators of vegetation in the Arctic each year. Some plants they pollinate include Arctic poppies, Arctic roses, and Arctic willows. Their pollinator effect seems to be heaviest in the early spring, but decreases as the year continues. Samuel Robinson has found that, by the time most scientists arrive for the brief warm summers, the \\"Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and Butterflies and Moths (Lepidoptera) were found to play a minor role in pollination, while flies (Dipterans) were shown to be the major pollinators.\\" Samuel Robinson, \\"Plant-Pollinator Interactions at Alexandra Fiord, Nunavut\\", Trail Six, Vol.5, 2011. One of the leading modern experts on B. polaris, Bernd Heinrich, agrees with this finding, saying that when \\"it gets warm, there‚Äôs a lot more fly pollination, and there‚Äôs actually some pollination by mosquitoes, as well.\\"  References  External links *NatureServe. 2015.

Overview  Following numerous attempts to organise a local football competition and the ever- increasing interest in the game, on 26 October 1907 the Lyceum Football ground was inaugurated in Marsa. This was to host the first football league campaign contested by Maltese teams and selections from the military service; the Royal Malta Artillery selection won the competition. This led to the set up of the first league season with all games to be played at the Lyceum Ground. A total of five teams joined the league and the stipulation was that each team had to provide their own goalposts and nets. The league ended with a two-way tussle between Floriana and Sliema Wanderers, after the latter were awarded a 2‚Äì1 win over St. Joseph's United following crowd trouble. In the decider game played on 24 April 1910, Floriana triumphed with a single goal from top scorer Salvu Samuele thereby winning the first edition and being awarded the Daily Malta Chronicle Cup, a cup specifically designed for the occasion.

The film maker asks him ten questions during the course of the interview which is inter-cut with a biography of Tenzin Gyatso, a history of modern Tibet and a chronicle of Ray's journey securing the interview. Synopsis The film begins as a chronicle of Rick Ray's journey through India to interview Tenzin Gyatso. The film switches between present and recent past, with stages of the trip introducing sections on the personal history of Tenzin Gyatso, the process used to select a Dalai Lama and Gyatso's journey into exile. The interview with Tenzin Gyatso begins midway through the film. This section is inter-cut between sections addressing philosophical questions and current affairs. Ray asks a range of questions, touching on philosophical, social and political issues. Some of the questions asked: *\\"Why do the poor seem happier than the rich?\\" *\\"How can one reconcile an attitude of non- violence when faced with a direct threat to one's safety and security?\\" *\\"Should countries be dedicated to preserving their traditions or embrace modern culture?\\" *\\"Will there be another Dalai Lama?\\" The questions are not numbered in the film and Ray admits to asking more than ten questions during the interview. The film also features the daily life of Tenzin Gyatso, his international peace efforts and his work with Tibetan refugees. The film features interviews with a Buddhist monk who fled violence in Tibet and Tenzin Tethong, who has served in the Tibetan Government in Exile for 20 years. Towards the end, the film touches on the issues of internet censorship in China, changes in Tibetan culture, and the 11th Panchen Lama controversy. Production Three years were spent tracking down rare, archival footage of the young Tenzin Gyatso, early interactions between the People's Republic of China and his government, and his eventual exile. In the end, the licensing of some of the footage for the film cost more than all the other expenses combined.

A surviving undeveloped portion of the battlefield is now part of the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1960. Description The Resaca de la Palma Battlefield is a separate unit of the Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park, located in northern Brownsville on the east side of Paredes Line Road north of East Price Road. The battlefield occupies a bend the Resaca de la Palma, an oxbow- like body of water that is part of the delta of the Rio Grande. The site is minimally developed, with a small parking area, walking trail, and interpretive signage. The Battle of Palo Alto, fought on May 8, 1846, was the first major battle of the Mexican-American War, and was an American victory. The Mexican forces of General Arista retreated to this point, where they established a defensive position on the north side of the resaca on May 9. They occupied an area densely overgrown by chaparral, near a bridge crossing at which they established their main artillery position. The American forces, who were in pursuit, launched a full-scale assault on the position, and drove the Mexicans across the resaca, capturing General Arista's command post and very nearly the general as well. The widely scattered battlefield has been broadly affected by subsequent land development. At the time of the site's National Historic Landmark designation in 1960, only a fragment was relatively unscathed, having been used as a citrus orchard and polo field. The Resaca De La Palma itself was at one time filled in, but the channel has subsequently been reestablished. A subsection of that battlefield portion was put on the market for development in 2002. The National Park Service worked on proposals to preserve the remaining portions of the site and include it as part of Palo Alto Battlefield National Historical Park. House resolutions were presented by Solomon Ortiz in 2008 and again in 2009 to make this law. The resolution was added to the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, which passed March 19, 2009.http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi- bin/query/F?c111:5:./temp/~c111ptEugu:e17280: HR 146, Section 7113 The NPS acquired the site from the Brownsville Community Foundation in early August 2011.

The mountain sits on the eastern side of the island and is clearly visible from the main island of Okinawa and the East China Sea. The outline of Mount Gusuku can be clearly seen from the Motobu Peninsula on Okinawa Island and Sesoko Island. The mountain has historically served as a nautical landmark and appears in nautical charts from the medieval period.

Geology Mount Gusuku is 70 million years older than the rest of Iejima. The mountain was formed by a unique offscrape phenomenon: an older level of bedrock was displaced by newer bedrock to form an admixture of the two. Utaki Mount Gusuku is a site considered sacred in the Ryukyuan religion. An utaki, or shrine of the Ryukyuan religion, is located halfway to the summit of the mountain, and the path leading to the shrine is marked by torii gates.

Yacht Columbia Columbia was built in 1893 by William Cramp & Sons for Joseph Harvey Ladew, Sr. of New-York. The hull, built under sub-contract by the Charles Hillman Company, was launched from Philadelphia on 23 August 1893.Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships erroneously has \\"built in 1898\\" the same year as commissioning. This causes confusion with the Ladew yacht Columbia built as a replacement in 1899 at the Crescent Shipyard, Elizabeth, New Jersey. That Columbia became HMCS Stadacona. The yacht was completed February 1894 as Cramp hull number 274 and on registration assigned the official number 127018 and the signal letters KLVB. As built characteristics were length overall, length on load waterline, beam of and a cruising draft of . Ladew had wanted to own the \\"fastest pleasure vessel afloat\\" so the yacht had both cruising and racing specifications. The cruising draft was at a displacement of 526 tons, but a racing draft of would be at 436 tons displacement. Steam was from two single ended boilers long with a diameter driving a four cylinder triple expansion engine that at forced draught developed 1,900 indicated horsepower. On leaving the yard on completion the yacht made a trial run on the New York Yacht Club course from Larchmont, on Long Island Sound, to New London, Connecticut making a mean speed of and over a deep water segment of the course where drag was minimized. Registered tonnage was and 190 net tons. Navy Acquisition and commissioning Columbia was purchased by the United States Navy for $95,000, renamed USS Wasp, and commissioned at New York City on 11 April 1898. =Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War service= The converted yacht departed New York on 26 April 1898, Lieutenant Aaron Ward in command, and headed south for Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War duty blockading Cuba. She stopped at Key West, Florida, from 1 to 7 May 1898 and arrived off Havana later on 7 May. From there, she moved west along the northern coast to Bahia Honda, also arriving there on 7 May. On 12 May 1898, while cruising on blockade station off the Cuban coast between Havana and Bahia Honda, Wasp joined a small convoy escorted by the revenue cutter USRC Manning and made up of merchantman SS Gussie and tugs Triton and Dewey. Gussie carried two companies of United States Army troops scheduled to land at Bahia Honda, while Triton and Dewey carried representatives of the press. Just before 1500 that afternoon, some of the soldiers from Gussie went ashore near Caba√±as, purportedly the first American troops to land on Cuban soil. They formed a skirmish line and started their advance through dense underbrush. At about 1515, Spanish Army forces counterattacked the American troops and opened fire on the ships in the bay. Wasp returned fire with her portside six-pounders, carefully avoiding the area occupied by friendly forces. At that point, she received word that the 100 or so soldiers fighting ashore were heavily outnumbered and outflanked to the west. The only course of action open to them was to disengage the enemy and reembark in Gussie. During that operation, Wasp joined Manning and recently arrived unarmored cruiser Dolphin in providing covering gunfire for the evacuation. When another landing, scheduled for the following day, did not occur, Wasp lobbed a few shells at an adobe watch-tower from which Spanish riflemen had taken the ships under fire, and then she resumed her patrol station off the coast. On 15 May 1898, the converted yacht departed the Cuban coast to return to Florida. She arrived at Key West that same day and remained in the Florida Keys, either at Key West or Sand Key, almost until the end of May 1898. Wasp returned to the blockade, at Cienfuegos, briefly on 29 May 1898 but was back at Key West on 31 May 1898. During June 1898, the yacht moved from blockade station to blockade station, returning periodically to the Florida Keys for necessities. From 9 June 1898 to 11 June 1898, she stood off Havana. After a three-day return to Key West, Wasp took station off the southeastern coast of Cuba on 20 June 1898, patrolling between Santiago de Cuba and Guantanamo Bay. At the beginning of July 1898, she paid a five-day visit to Key West, returning to the Santiago de Cuba area again on 10 July 1898. On 19 July 1898, the converted yacht cleared Guantanamo Bay for Nipe Bay on Cuba's northeastern coast. She arrived at Nipe Bay late on the morning of 21 July 1898 and, on orders to reconnoiter the bay in company with armed tugboat USS Leyden, started in toward Port Nipe. Upon entering, Wasp sighted a Spanish warship at anchor some four miles up the bay. She fired several shots at the signal station located at the entrance, then sped forward to engage the enemy ship. At 1244, the Spanish ship opened fire at extreme range, and Wasp returned fire immediately. Leyden, followed by gunboats USS Annapolis and USS Topeka, quickly joined in. As the range decreased, American gunfire became more accurate, and all four ships began scoring telling hits on the enemy. Finally, at 1312, the Spaniard's colors disappeared. Wasp and her three colleagues ceased fire and watched their quarry, the sloop Jorge Juan,Conway's All the World's Fighting Ships 1860‚Äì1905, p. 386 sink at 1342. After making a complete reconnaissance of the southern and western portions of the bay, Wasp anchored there for the night. On 23 July 1898, Wasp departed Cuba, bound for Puerto Rico, and arrived off Fajardo that same day. For the next seven weeks, she cruised the coasts of Puerto Rico in company with auxiliary cruiser USS Dixie, Annapolis, and gunboat USS Gloucester. Throughout the entire period, only one noteworthy event occurred. On 27 July 1898, the four ships encountered three Spanish brigantines at Ponce but evaluated them as too insignificant even to take as prizes. On 8 September 1898, Wasp departed San Juan to return to the United States. After a five-day stop at Charleston, South Carolina, she continued her voyage north on 18 September 1898 and entered the Norfolk Navy Yard at Norfolk, Virginia, on 21 September 1898. On 27 September 1898, she was decommissioned there and laid up. =Peacetime service= On 15 December 1898, the yacht was loaned to the Florida Naval Militia for training purposes. That tour of duty lasted until 21 June 1899, at which time she was returned to the U.S. Navy. She resumed her retirement to serve as station ship at Port Royal, South Carolina. In July 1902, she returned to Norfolk to be decommissioned once again on 23 July 1902. On 2 October 1902, Wasp went into commission again and received orders to the 8th Naval District. During her service there as a district tender, she made infrequent cruises in the Gulf of Mexico and the West Indies. In 1906, she moved from the Gulf of Mexico to Newport, Rhode Island, for a tour of duty at the Torpedo Station. In 1907, she visited East Coast, Gulf Coast, and Mississippi River ports of the United States during a cruise to spur enlistments in the U.S. Navy. In 1908, Wasp began a nine-year assignment, again training naval militiamen, this time on loan to the New York Naval Militia. Navy records show armament at the time of World War I service as two three pounder and two one pounder guns. =World War I Service= That duty ended early in 1917, as the United States moved closer to war. On 7 April 1917, the day after the American declaration of war on the German Empire that brought the United States into World War I, Wasp began patrolling the coast of Long Island. Throughout the first year of the war, the yacht cruised the coastal waters of the 3d Naval District as a unit of, and later as flagship for, Squadron 8, Patrol Force. In April 1918, Wasp received orders detaching her from the 3d Naval District and assigning her to duty at Annapolis, Maryland. She arrived in Annapolis on 9 May 1918 and, but for periodic runs to Norfolk, remained there for the remainder of her naval career. =Disposal= Struck from the Navy List on 13 November 1919, Wasp was formally decommissioned at Norfolk on 1 December 1919. On 20 September 1921, she was sold to Halsted P. Layton of Georgetown, Delaware.  Footnotes  References * Chesneau, Roger, and Eugene M. Kolesnik, Eds.

The species is primarily found in the arctic areas of Canada, Alaska, Greenland, northern Scandinavia, and Russia. However, more recently (2015) the nearctic bumble bee, Bombus natvigi has been separated from this species, based on genetic analysis. Then, Bombus hyperboreus is limited to the Palaearctic.. The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. [i]Bombus natvigi[/i] It is a brood parasite, and attacks and enslaves other bumblebee colonies in order to reproduce as they do not even have the ability to produce workers themselves. Most of its targets are colonies of species of the same subgenus, Alpinobombus. Taxonomy and phylogeny Bombus hyperboreus was originally named B. arcticus in 1802. Zoologist Sch√∂nherr renamed the species to B. hyperboreus in 1809. It was not until 1950 that B. hyperboreus was used commonly to identify the species. Petitions were needed to change the name to B. hyperboreus officially. Bombus hyperboreus is part of the genus Bombus, which is composed of all of the bumblebee species. It also falls under the subgenus Alpinobombus and is most closely related to Bombus neoboreus, but also shares relations with Bombus balteatus, B. alpinus, and B. polaris. Bombus natvigi has been recently separated from Bombus hyperboreus based on genetic analysis. Bombus hyperboreus is palaearctic, while Bombus natvigi is nearctic.Home Page The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. Bombus natvigi. 2016 Description Due to its parasitic lifestyle, workers are rarely present. Queens and drones are similar, with the thorax and anterior part of the abdomen brownish-orange. The thorax has a black transversal band, while the last abdominal segments are black. Because the environment the species inhabits is cold and windy, it is suggested that their black bands act as a method to increase their body temperature through solar radiation, and their long, dense hair coat minimizes insulation loss. The mean length of the queen is relatively large at and is presumed to allow the species to counter the strong effects of the windy and cold environment. Distribution and habitat Members of the subgenus Alpinobombus, including B. hyperboreus, live in grasslands and shrub land in high Arctic and alpine areas, otherwise known as the Arctic tundra. They are distributed in the Arctic, Palearctic, and western Nearctic regions. The distribution of the species in terms of altitude varies depending on the season. During the summer, B. hyperboreus makes use of the entire altitudinal range (). However, they tend to inhabit and forage at basal altitudes in the spring and higher altitudes towards the end of the summer and beginning of autumn.  Diet  Bombus hyperboreus have a varied diet and mostly forage on medium to deep flowers. Some species that have been observed pollinating are of the genus Pedicularis, specifically Pedicularis hirsuta and Pedicularis lapponica. But they are not limited to just those species. Near Lake Latnjajaure of northern Sweden, Bombus hyperboreus have been observed collecting pollen and nectar of Saxifraga oppositifolia and then switching to forage on Astragalus alpinus and Bartsia alpina once those come into flower. The flowers they forage on also vary depending on the season and altitude of their habitation. In Mt. Njulla of northern Sweden, for example, in the beginning of the summer, Rhododendron lapponicum and Salix species dominate their diet, but as the season goes on, their diet changes to consumption of Vaccinium species mid-summer and, finally, to consumption of Astragalus alpinus and Solidago virgaurea towards the beginning of August. Colony cycle In the early spring, mated queens emerge from the frozen ground in the tundra and seek out a growing colony of a different bee species. Bombus hyperboreus obtains a colony by killing the queen of host species and enslaving her workers. The queen produces solely queens and drones. Because queens do not produce workers of their own, they rely on the captured workers to care for them. The number of queens and drones the species produces is far greater than any of the other alpine and non-alpine species of the Arctic region and are most commonly seen from early spring to the end of August, in tandem with the species that it usurps.  Nesting  Nests are mainly found covered by foliage, such as moist, mossy shrub, lichens, twigs, withered leaves of Salix glauca and dry leaves of Pyrola grandiflora. The entrance to the nest is also usually well camouflaged. Sometimes, waxy coverings are used to support additional foliage above the nest. Inside the nest, many cocoons carry male and queen larvae, with most of the vacated ones containing honey, and a few containing pollen. The nests have a tremendous amount of honey (), considering that a majority of the hive is composed of sexual beings, queens and drones, and few workers. The temperatures of the nests are closely regulated and maintained at a range of . Bees of the genus Bombus organize their cocoons in a certain manner. New cocoons are placed slightly to the side of other cocoons so that the emerging adults do not disturb the rest of the cells. After the emergence of the adults, the cocoons are used to store honey or pollen. Behavior = Parasitic behavior = Bombus hyperboreus, a cuckoo bumblebee, is known to be a social parasite among the bumblebee family, mostly attacking and enslaving colonies of species of the same subgenus. Though it mostly usurps Bombus polaris, there have been evidence of B. hyperboreus usurping Bombus balteatus and Bombus jonellus as well. B. hyperboreus tends to usurp species in its subgenus. Most parasitic bumblebees depend on social bumblebees because they do not have pollen baskets and cannot produce their own wax. However, B. hyperboreus is different: although it is parasitic, it has pollen baskets and collects pollen. To begin usurpation, an impregnated queen emerges in the spring some time after a B. polaris queen, and searches to invade her nest. After invading her colony, the B. polaris queen is killed and her workers are enslaved. The B. hyperboreus queen lays her first batch of eggs, which emerge as queens and drones, and are fed and reared by the enslaved workers. B. hyperboreus evolved traits of social parasitism because it inhabits harsh cold environments and must produce small colonies during short periods when conditions are favorable. These very short periods of time, favorable for founding and reproduction, push B. hyperboreus to invade and enslave other colonies, thereby reducing the time it would take to start a colony on their own. = Queen behavior = Depending on its habitat, B. hyperboreus queens will exhibit different behavior and will produce different types of offspring. Alpine and Arctic habitats have short growing seasons (2 to 3 months), which pushes the species to produce more sexual individuals (queens and males) instead of workers. Additionally, queens found in Scandinavia have been found to actively collect nectar and pollen while those in found in Arctic Canada have not been found to do so. The queens also invade and usurp other colonies once they emerge, and rely on the workers to help rear new queens and drones = Mating behavior = To mate, males, otherwise known as drones, patrol circuits of scent marks to find queens. B. hyperboreus have been found to have certain compounds that mark their pheromones. These include octadecenol, 2,3-dihydro-6-transfarnesol, citronellol, and geranylcitronellol. Risk of predation There is not much information on the predators that threaten B. hyperboreus. The few predators they have include: * Foxes * Wheatears * Humans Competition B. hyperboreus compete with many other species of the same subgenus for resources and habitats. The alpine species, species that mostly occupy high altitudes, that it competes with include B. alpinus, and B. polaris. The non-alpine species it competes with include Bombus pratorum, B. jonellus, B. pascuorum, B. lucorum, B. lapponicus and B. balteatus. Yet, it mostly encounters alpine species because they usually share the same altitude at different times of the season and thus compete for the same resources at the same time. Importance to humans Bumblebees play a vital role in propagation of certain flower species as well as production of crops for human consumption. However, due to pesticide use, urban development, and climate change, bumblebee species are being threatened. With rising temperatures and longer periods of drought, Bombus hyperboreus are experiencing loss of habitat and are declining in numbers, placing them as \\"Vulnerable\\" on the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List.

It was built immediately to the southeast of Lafayette Park in the Westlake District, in 1927. The Granada Buildings mezzanine level History The project was designed by architect Franklin Harper with 42 suites combining offices and studios. Each unit had two levels, with office or shop space on the ground floor and living space on the second level or loft area. When Harper announced his plan in October 1927, the Los Angeles Times described the $1 million combined shop, studio and apartment structure as something entirely new in Los Angeles, resembling the design of European specialty shops. The apartments were located on the mezzanine level and consisted of kitchen, living room, bath and open porch. Design The dominant feature of the Granada is the courtyard running between the four structures. The courtyards serve both a functional role as the paths to each of the suites and an aesthetic role as a garden area providing shade. One architectural textbook describes the exterior space as the dominant organizing theme for the building, giving the complex \\"all the attributes of the traditional narrow commercial street.\\" The Granada Buildings courtyard The beauty of the Granada has attracted architects, artists, and urban planners from its earliest days. Gregory Ain and James Garrott shared office space here before World War II. George Hurrell, a noted Hollywood portrait photographer, lived and worked in Suite 9, photographing silent film stars in his office at the Granada. In the Princeton Architectural Press' 1997 book, \\"Courtyard Housing,\\" the authors described the Granda as follows: > The Granada Buildings have attained an almost mythical quality in the Los > Angeles design world, as architects, graphic designers, and artists have > made them their homes. The court is one of the monuments of southern > California architecture and one that contains the seeds of an urban > existence whose promise was never fulfilled. Preservation and media In 1980, noted Los Angeles Times columnist Jack Smith referred to the structure as \\"the lovely old Spanish-style Granada Building.\\" Later renamed the Granada Buildings, the complex was purchased and restored by the Shidler Group in the late 1980s and received a preservation award from the Los Angeles Conservancy. (\\"The Granada buildings, located at 627 Lafayette Park Place in Mid-Wilshire, were among several entrants recognized with a 1990 Preservation Awards by the Conservancy.\\") In 2003, the complex was named the \\"Best Nonprofit Enclave\\" by LA Weekly. The Granada received the award due to the concentration of non-profits having offices there, including PEN Center USA, Theatre of Hearts, and People in Progress. LA Weekly noted at the time: \\"Creative people are drawn to the Granada because of its fascinating history, charming architecture, old-school elevator and lovely courtyard: a gorgeous garden with flowing fountains along the walkways, a taste of the Alhambra a short stroll away from picturesque but gritty MacArthur Park.\\" The complex was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM # 238) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in April 1981. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. The Granada is one of several Registered Historic Places encircling Lafayette Park, including the Bryson Apartment Hotel, The Town House, the Felipe De Neve Branch library, and Bullocks Wilshire one block to the west.

Zinoviev expressed skepticism and frustration toward writings that attempted to expose and reveal the evils of Soviet communism. Zinoviev chose, instead, to satirize and ridicule Soviet society in Yawning Heights, presented as the city / nation of Ibansk. The novel has been compared to the writings of Jonathan Swift, Lewis Carroll, and others. Everyone in Yawning Heights is named Iban Ibanovich Ibanov, so each is instead referred to by a descriptive name, rather than their proper name. Some are recognizable. In the book, one of the characters writes a satirical novel critical of his society. The character knows that the Brothers (KGB) are searching his house to find his controversial book. This represents the level of metafiction. Satire As a logician, Zinoviev was able to reduce many features of Soviet communism to what he calls \\"scientific laws\\". The book is also filled with numerous paradoxes and logical twists, √† la Catch-22. The book begins with a logically-reflexive definition: a preface claims that the book details the result of an experiment. The preface identifies the purpose of the experiment: \\"to uncover those who disapprove of its implementation, and to take the appropriate measures\\". One satire in a late chapter is that, after conquering the whole world in the Great Ibanskian Kissoff, the leaders of Ibansk discover another nation, Sub-Ibansk, whose inhabitants live underground beneath Ibansk and subsist of the sewage generated by Ibansk. Title The title of the book is a pun on a cliche of Soviet ideological propaganda, describing communism as the \\"Shining heights\\". The words \\"yawning\\" and \\"shining\\" in Russian are identical, except for the first letter: a Z in the case of \\"yawning\\", and an S in the case of \\"shining\\". The \\"yawning\\" in the generally accepted translation of the Russian title does not refer to a \\"yawn\\" but rather to its meaning as in \\"yawning abyss\\". To capture the paradoxical nature of the Russian title, perhaps an apter translation would have been \\"abysmal heights\\" (the primary meaning of abysmal derives from abyss).

It was declared a Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (No. 159) by the Los Angeles Cultural Heritage Commission in 1976, and it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Bunche's boyhood home Bunche was born in Detroit, Michigan and later lived in Albuquerque, New Mexico, but moved to Los Angeles to live with his maternal grandmother when his mother died in 1917. Bunche and his sister, Grace, were raised at the house on 40th Place by their grandmother, Lucy Taylor Johnson, their two aunts (Nelle and Ethel), and their uncle Thomas Johnson. While living in Los Angeles, Bunche became the valedictorian at both Jefferson High School, one-half block away, and UCLA, then located at Vermont Avenue and Melrose. Bunche was also a star basketball player while at UCLA. Bunche won the 1950 Nobel Peace Prize for his work in negotiating and drafting the 1949 Armistice Agreements that ended the 1948 Arab-Israeli War.Benjamin Rivlin, \\"Vita: Ralph Johnson Bunche: Brief life of a champion of human dignity: 1903-1971\\", Harvard Magazine, Nov. 2003.

Bunche's boyhood home fell into disrepair and suffered from vandalism and graffiti in the 1980s and 1990s. The house sat vacant for a decade, \\"used only by squatters, taggers, gang members, and vagrants.\\" In 1996, the home was acquired by the Dunbar Economic Development Corp., a nonprofit group with plans to turn it into a museum. The group's plans were delayed by a lack of funding until the California Community Foundation issued a $100,000 interest-free loan in 1999. After a 1999 news report about funding delays and graffiti covering the home, Mayor Richard Riordan donned a hardhat and joined a work crew in cleaning up the home. =Dr. Ralph J. Bunche Peace & Heritage Center= The home was preserved and furnished with photographs and memorabilia from Bunche's life. It operated as the Dr. Ralph J. Bunche Peace & Heritage Center, an interpretive museum and community center to promote peaceful interaction of all groups within South Central Los Angeles. The property was fully restored between 2002 and 2004, by Design Aid Architects, winning a Los Angeles Conservancy preservation award in 2006. That year, the house was described in the Los Angeles Times as \\"brilliant, with sunlight streaming through modified bay windows, scrubbed wood floors and an airy parlor/den/dining room.\\" =Oral history project= The Dr. Ralph J. Bunche Peace and Heritage Center Oral History Project was a joint venture with UCLA intended to collect oral histories on Bunche's life in Los Angeles as well as the Central Avenue and Dunbar Hotel community in South Los Angeles. The oral histories collected by the project were displayed at the Ralph J. Bunche House until about 2011, when they were moved to UCLA. The house now operates as a private residence.

Biography Lee began his career as a character designer at Industrial Light and Magic, where he worked on several motion pictures including the computer special effects for Star Wars: Episode I ‚Äì The Phantom Menace. Lee was then hired by Microsoft Game Studios as Lead Game Designer, designing and directing games for PC and Xbox. While working for Microsoft he was the Executive Producer and Lead Designer for The Beast, one of the world‚Äôs first Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) used to promoted the Steven Spielberg film A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Lee has co-founded several start-ups all within the gaming arena. In 2003 he co-founded 42 Entertainment, a design company in the field of alternate reality games (ARGs). 42 has created multiple ARGs, including, I Love Bees to promote the Xbox game Halo 2, and Year Zero, to promote the Nine Inch Nails album Year Zero. He later he co-founded (with Dawne Weisman) EDOC Laundry, a company designed to produce ARGs using clothes as the primary platform. Consumers deciphered codes hidden within garments and entered the results into the game's main website to reveal pieces of a distributed story. In 2007, Lee founded Fourth Wall Studios, an entertainment studio aiming to develop and publish entertainment experiences of varying scopes. Lee developed a new form of interactive programming that engaged audiences across multiple platforms via new technology he created. Projects such as the Emmy Award-winning series ‚ÄúDirty Work‚Äù brought viewers into the show with interactive elements such as ‚Äúintegrated phone calls, texts and emails‚Äù as part of the viewing experience. Elan returned to Microsoft as the Chief Design Officer for Xbox Entertainment Studios soon after the launch of the Xbox One game console in 2013. By 2014, Elan left Microsoft with the plan to build a new technology-based TV studio and went as far as building a prototype, building a team and successfully raised about $5 million for his new endeavor.  Exploding Kittens  In 2015 Elan Lee partnered with Matthew Inman (The Oatmeal) and Shane Small to create the card game 'Exploding Kittens', funded on Kickstarter. ‚ÄòExploding Kittens‚Äô (originally called ‚ÄòBomb Squad‚Äô) became the most-backed campaign on Kickstarter at the time, with 219,382 backers and a total of $8.78 million. Elan said, ‚ÄúWhen ‚ÄòExploding Kittens‚Äô launched, I thought it would be a side project on the weekend. It‚Äôs so weird when the side project dwarfs the scope and scale of the main project. And so I decided to return the money I raised. I realized that if I didn‚Äôt turn all my attention to this, it would become the biggest regret of my life.‚Äùhttp://explodingkittens.com/#what Also in 2015, thanks to the success of the Exploding Kittens game, Lee and Inman founded the company Exploding Kittens Inc. Following another effective Kickstarter campaign (over $3m from 85,000 backers), the company released its second tabletop game, Bears vs. Babies, in 2017. Exploding Kittens Inc. went on to produce another game in 2018 ‚Äì You‚Äôve Got Crabs. 2019 saw two new releases ‚Äì Throw Throw Burrito and On a Scale of One to T-Rex. The former was again funded through Kickstarter, while the latter was an Amazon-exclusive release. In October 2019, the American businessman and investor Peter Chernin, CEO of The Chernin Group (TCG), announced a $30 million investment into Exploding Kittens Inc. This gives TCG a minority stake in the company. According to Matthew Inman, the company plans to use the funds for its first live gaming convention Burning Cat, inspired by the Burning Man festival, as well as investing into hiring more artists in order to increase production from one game a year to between three and five.

Wasp was acquired by the Navy on a free-lease basis on 29 June 1917 and was assigned the classification SP-1159 but was never listed in the Naval Vessel Register. She was used as a patrol craft by the 9th Naval District‚Äîat the time a part of a single administrative entity called the \\"9th, 10th, and 11th Naval Districts\\"‚Äîand operated on the Great Lakes until returned to her owner on 3 November 1917.

Boomerang is mounted on mobile vehicles such as the Humvee, Stryker, and MRAP combat vehicles. There were plans to integrate it into the Land Warrior system. Development Boomerang grew out of a program conceived by the U.S. Department of Defense in late 2003, months after the traditional combat phase of the Iraq War had ended on 1 May, at a time when it was clear that U.S. troops were increasingly at risk from a growing and aggressive insurgency. Often, troops in noisy Humvees did not know they were being shot at until someone was hit. U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld approached DARPA and asked for near-term solutions that could be applied to the conflict in Iraq. Rumsfeld was looking for something that did not have to be a perfect solution, but was at least better than nothing. The U.S. Army and Special Operations Command began using a limited number of French-made PILAR anti- sniper systems in 2003. DARPA developed an American system. Karen Wood, a program manager at DARPA, said BBN's previous work was the most impressive that was examined. BBN had previously developed a less sophisticated counter sniper system named \\"Bullet Ears\\" under DARPA sponsorship in 1997. The new requirements included: *Shooter localization to plus or minus 15 degree accuracy, and within one second of the shot *Reliability for shot miss distances of one to 30 meters *Ability to detect and localize fire from AK-47s and other small arms at ranges from 50 to 150 meters *Reliable performance in urban environments with low buildings *Operable when mounted on a vehicle moving up to 60 miles per hour on either rough terrain or highways *Ability to withstand sand, pebbles, rain, and light foliage impacts *Ability to deliver alert information in both a voice announcement and on an LED display *Microphone array and electronics box must be replaceable in the field The first prototype was developed in 65 days. Challenges that it faced were filtering out noise from the vehicle on which it is mounted (such as loud engines and static sounds from the radio), ignoring sounds similar to that of a gunshot (such as fireworks or a car back-firing), factoring in bullet ricochets, and ignoring outgoing fire from friendly troops. Small quantities of Boomerang were battle tested in Iraq and further improvements led to 2nd and 3rd generation versions called the Boomerang II and Boomerang III. In June 2008 a $73.8 million firm fixed price contract was awarded by the U.S. Army to BBN for 8,131 Boomerang Systems, spares and training services. In 2005 Boomerang won both the DARPA \\"Significant Technical Achievement Award\\" and the Massachusetts Innovation and Technology Exchange (MITX) \\"Technology Influencer of the Year Award.\\" Boomerang does not claim to be able to detect shots fired from firearms with sound suppressors. Operation The Boomerang unit attaches on a mast to the rear of a vehicle and uses an array of seven small microphone sensors. The sensors detect and measure both the muzzle blast and the supersonic shock wave from a supersonic bullet traveling through the air (and so is less effective against subsonic ammunition). Each microphone detects the sound at slightly different times. Boomerang then computes the direction a bullet is coming from, distance above the ground and range to the shooter in less than one second. Users receive simultaneous visual and auditory information on the point of fire from an LED 12-hour clock image display panel and speaker mounted inside the vehicle. For example, if someone is firing from the rear, the system announces \\"Shot, 6 o'clock\\", an LED illuminates at the 6 o'clock position, and the computer tells the user the shooter's range, elevation and azimuth. Boomerang works in extreme weather, in open field and in urban environments, whether static or moving. BBN states that false shot detections are less than one per thousand hours of system operation at vehicle speeds under 50 miles per hour. Related development Starting in 2011, the US Army began issuing the Individual Gunshot Detector (IGD) which is similar to the Boomerang in function and purpose, but is worn by dismounted soldiers. The 118th Boston Marathon (2014) Stationary Boomerang III units were utilized in the \\"Athletes' Village\\", at the starting line, and finish line areas of the 118th running of The Boston Marathon as a result of the 2013 bombings that took place at the finish line. The Boomerang units were mounted to telephone poles and setup on tripods and networked together so all could be monitored from any of the mobile command units. Some were also deployed on mobile vehicles.

Known as Budds Creek Road, the state highway runs from U.S. Route 301 (US 301) in Allens Fresh east to MD 5 in Leonardtown. MD 234 is the primary east-west highway of southern Charles County and western St. Mary's County, connecting the St. Mary's County seat of Leonardtown and the communities of Clements, Chaptico, Budds Creek, Wicomico, and Newport with US 301, which heads north to La Plata, the county seat of Charles County, and south to the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge over the Potomac River. MD 234 originally followed what is now MD 238 from Chaptico east to MD 5 at Helen. The Chaptico- Leonardtown portion of the highway was then designated as part of MD 237\\\\. The original MD 234 was constructed in the early 1920s; MD 237 was built in the late 1920s and early 1930s. MD 237 between Clements and Leonardtown was reconstructed around 1950. The Chaptico-Clements section of MD 237 and MD 234 west of Chaptico were rebuilt around 1960, projects that involved many relocations and several new bridges. At the conclusion of the project in 1961, MD 234 was extended east over the former section of MD 237 to Leonardtown; MD 238 was extended from Chaptico to Helen on what was previously MD 234\\\\. Route description View east along MD 234 near Budds Creek MD 234 begins at a directional crossover intersection with US 301 (Robert Crain Highway) about north of the Governor Harry W. Nice Memorial Bridge, also known as the Potomac River Bridge. The state highway heads east as a two-lane undivided road that crosses over CSX's Popes Creek Subdivision and passes through the hamlet of Allens Fresh. MD 234 crosses Allens Fresh Run, a tributary of the Wicomico River, as the stream flows out of the southern end of Zekiah Swamp, which is preserved within Zekiah Swamp Natural Environment Area. The state highway passes through the community of Newport, home of St. Mary's Roman Catholic Church, and crosses Gilbert Swamp Run into the hamlet of Wicomico, which contains the historic home Sarum. MD 234 leaves Charles County by crossing over Budds Creek. MD 234 curves southeast through the hamlet of Budds Creek, where the highway meets the southern end of MD 236 (Thompson Corner Road) and passes three motorsports facilities: Maryland International Raceway, Budds Creek Motocross, and Potomac Speedway. The state highway continues southeast, passing by Wicomico Shores Country Club and its associated residential area separated from the highway by a large tract of forest. MD 234 crosses Hayden Run and passes through Chaptico, where the highway intersects MD 238 at a roundabout; MD 238 heads northeast as Chaptico Road and southwest as Maddox Road. The state highway passes another historic home, Deep Falls, on the way to Clements. At Clements, MD 234 comes to a roundabout with MD 242 (Colton Point Road), which leads south to the site of Maryland's First Landing at St. Clement's Island. A park and ride lot is located at the northwest corner of this roundabout. The state highway crosses Saint Clements Creek and heads east through farmland, crossing Nelson Run right before the highway reaches its eastern terminus at MD 5 (Point Lookout Road) on the western edge of Leonardtown. History MD 234 originally followed roughly its current course from Allens Fresh to Chaptico, then followed what is now MD 238 east to MD 5 at Helen. The highway between Chaptico and Leonardtown via Clements was MD 237. MD 234 was constructed as a gravel road from Allens Fresh east to Newport around 1921. The highway was extended east to the Charles - St. Mary's county line in 1923. The Chaptico-Helen road, as well as of road west of Chaptico, were also constructed in 1923. The original course of MD 234 was completed when the gap between Chaptico and the county line at Budds Creek was filled in 1925. MD 237 was started between Clements and Leonardtown in 1924 and between Chaptico and Clements in 1926. By 1927, there were two sections of gravel east from Chaptico and east from Clements. Another section of highway west from Clements was built in 1928. By 1930, MD 237 was complete from Clements to Leonardtown. The gap between Chaptico and Clements was under construction in 1930 and completed in 1932. Westbound MD 234 approaching US 301 in Allens Fresh The first upgrade of MD 234 was a relocation at Allens Fresh Run, which included replacing a dangerous one-way bridge over the stream, that was completed in 1933. MD 237 was reconstructed with a bituminous stabilized gravel surface between Clements and Leonardtown in 1950 and 1951, a project that included new bridges over Clements Creek at a spot known as Head-of-the- Bay and over Nelson Run near Leonardtown. Reconstruction of MD 234 from Allens Fresh to Chaptico and MD 237 from there to Clements occurred between 1959 and 1961. MD 234 and MD 237 were significantly straightened out, leaving behind many sections of old alignment: Glasva School Road in Allens Fresh; Allens Fresh Road between Allens Fresh and Newport; Stines Store Road in Newport; Plater Road and Olde Mill Road in Wicomico; Stone Corner Lane, which is unsigned MD 868G, and Reed Road in Budds Creek; and Horse Shoe Road between Chaptico and Clements. The project also involved new bridges over Gilbert Swamp Run, Chaptico Creek, and Budds Creek. When the project was completed in 1961, MD 234 assumed the course of MD 237 between Chaptico and Leonardtown and MD 238 was extended over the segment of MD 234 between Chaptico and Helen. The first roundabout in St. Mary's County was installed at the intersection of MD 238 and MD 234 in Chaptico in 2007. In September 2011, MD 234's bridge over Allens Fresh Run was washed out by flooding of the creek due to torrential rainfall from the remnants of Tropical Storm Lee. Traffic was detoured over MD 236, MD 6, and US 301 until a temporary bridge was completed parallel to the damaged section in November 2011. The Maryland State Highway Administration dismantled the damaged bridge and built a replacement bridge in 2012.

Sanyukai's services include a free clinic, as well as an outreach program which distributes food and clothing to the homeless in the area. Structure Sanyukai is located in the San'ya district in Tokyo, Japan. The building has three floors, and includes the free Sanyu clinic, a kitchen where food is prepared for the Outreach Program, and an office where free legal advice is offered. Sanyukai also hosts events in an effort to bring the community together in aiding the homeless. Clinic Located on the first floor of the Sanyukai building, Sanyu Clinic is one of the only free clinics in all of Tokyo. Homeless members of society can receive consultations with professional doctors and nurses. Depending on the diagnosis, the patient may receive medical advice, free prescription medication, or a ride to the hospital for intensive care. Most of the clinic staff are medical professionals volunteering on their time off. At this point, Sanyu clinic hosts 9 doctors, 1 chiropractor, 4 acupuncturists and 6 nurses. Working full-time at Sanyukai is one registered nurse who is also the clinic coordinator; another nurse works part-time. Outreach program Centered around the kitchen on the second floor, the Outreach Program strives to provide the homeless with free meals and decent clothing. Several times a week, Sanyukai will prepare individually wrapped meals and go on patrol in the area. Concentrating in parks and riverside areas where homeless individuals tend to frequent, these patrols provide free meals and conversation. This Program works to not only provide the homeless with daily needs, but also establish Sanyukai as a place of safety and help for them. While providing food, the patrol also takes note of everyone's health, sometimes recommending a visit to the Sanyu Clinic. The Outreach Program works to establish and maintain connections with the homeless in the area, to more effectively aid those in need. Social center Another aspect of Sanyukai is how it functions as a gathering place for the homeless in the area. Everyday, a large group of people can be found in front of the building, joking and socializing. Most of the homeless people in the area are middle aged or elderly men who are out of work and have no real family. Sanyukai functions as a place where these people can relax and socialize. The volunteers provide green tea and other basic things at the Sanyukai entrance that help these people on a daily basis. The homeless are provided with toothbrushes, shaving razors, towels, hand soap and laundry detergent, to help them maintain their hygiene and health. Once a month a barber volunteers his services and spends a day giving as many free haircuts as he can. Overall, Sanyukai is not only a place where the homeless go when they are sick or starving, but rather a landmark where they are welcomed and taken care of.

Indian Hills High School previously used the campus, and in 2008 actor Will Smith funded New Village Academy and leased the Calabasas facilities for three years. Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith selected the management for the school. Educational methodologies used by the school include Study Technology, Montessori education, Gardner, and Bruner methods. The school closed on June 28, 2013. Funding The school's campus was formerly used by Indian Hills High School, which relocated to Agoura High School in Agoura Hills, California to save money. In 2008, actor Will Smith paid US$890,000 to lease the Calabasas campus for three years, restructuring it from a high school to a private elementary school called New Village Academy. The school is located close to Will Smith's home in Calabasas. In 2004 Smith and his wife Jada Pinkett Smith gave $20,000 to the Scientology homeschooling organization Hollywood Education and Literacy Program (HELP), which is licensed by the non- profit corporation Applied Scholastics. Prior to New Village Academy, Smith and Pinkett Smith's two children were home-schooled by their mother. The school was founded by the Smiths, who say they are not Scientologists, about three years ago as a home school for their younger children and those of several other families. Smith and his wife installed their current director of philanthropy, Jana Babatunde-Bey, as the executive director of the school and Jacqueline Olivier as Head of School. In an appearance on Live with Regis and Kelly Will Smith commented on the educational methodologies used by the school: \\"There are just very powerful educational concepts that we believe in, and we feel like we want to design the system that revolutionizes public education.\\" \\"New Village Academy was born of a simple question, 'Is it possible to create an educational environment in which children have fun learning?' Jada and I believe the answer is 'Yes.'\\", said Smith in a released statement. A spokesperson for Will Smith told The Guardian: \\"Will is leasing the campus for three years, plus he'll cover all costs such as utilities. The academy will be run privately, and will include pre-kindergarten through grade six.\\" New Village Academy's Calabasas facilities opened in 2008. In March 2009 the Associated Press reported that Jada Pinkett-Smith planned to open a companion high-school. Federal tax filing showed that Will Smith donated $1.2 million to the school in 2010. Teaching and staff Educational methodologies used by the school included Montessori, Gardner, Jerome Bruner, and Study Technology. Subjects included in the school's curriculum include mathematics, literacy, Spanish, karate, yoga, robotics, technology, etiquette, art, and living skills. New Village Academy served organic meals to students, and laptops were made available to all students. The school encouraged parental involvement and restricted access to television. Tuition was approximately $22,500 per year to attend the school, and 80% of the students would receive financial assistance. =Scientology ties= Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes' daughter Suri attended the school from 2009 The staff includes a number of Scientologists, including the Director of Learning, Director of Qualifications and Artistic Director, as well as some of the school's teachers. New Village Academy's Director of Learning, formerly the director of HELP in Boston, graduated from the Scientology Delphi School in Milton, Massachusetts. The school's website lists \\"Study Technology\\", a form of education developed by Church of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, as one of its methodologies. The website utilizes Scientology terminology including \\"spiraling\\" and \\"gradient\\" in order to illustrate how students learn in the school's programs. The school's motto \\"Spiral Up\\" has been compared to Scientology's term \\"dwindling spiral\\", when \\"one commits overt acts unwittingly\\", although \\"spiral curriculum\\" is also a term associated with Jerome Bruner. When a student needs to be disciplined they are taken to the \\"ethics teacher\\". Jada Pinkett Smith told ABC News, \\"Study Technology is a secular methodology intended to help students better understand what is being studied and apply it to real life. NVLA integrates this methodology as a tool in instructional design by providing teachers the framework to design lessons and curriculum.\\" In response to reports of Scientology ties in 2008, Jacqueline Olivier who was administrator at the time, denied that the school had a religious affiliation, and told the Los Angeles Times: \\"People tend to think Study Technology is a subject, but it is really just the way the subject is taught. They then come to the conclusion that we are teaching Scientology when actually a methodology doesn't have anything to do with content.\\" Olivier was appointed administrator at the school in 2007, her duties have included hiring all teachers since that time. She said that in addition to Scientologists the school also has Muslim, Christian and Jewish staff members, and said: \\"We are a secular school.\\" \\"Faculty and staff do not promote their own religions at school.\\" Children from all religious backgrounds will be accepted at the school. Professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and Scientology critic David S. Touretzky was critical of the school's use of Study Technology, and told the Los Angeles Times: \\"There is no reputable educator anywhere who endorses Study Technology. What happens is that children are inculcated with Scientology jargon and are led to regard L.R. Hubbard as an authority figure. They are laying the groundwork for later bringing people into Scientology.\\" Touretzky maintains a website critical of Study Technology, and told the Los Angeles Times that the terms \\"Director of Qualifications\\" and the school's \\"Qual\\" department refer to those tested by a Church of Scientology qualifications teacher in a Scientology Auditing session. Karin Pouw, Scientology spokeswoman and director of public affairs for Church of Scientology International, disputed Touretzky's statements and asserted to the Los Angeles Times that Study Tech is not a religious methodology and is used in schools internationally. In early September 2008 members of the anti-Scientology group Project Chanology protested outside of New Village Academy and objected to their claims that L. Ron Hubbard techniques were being used in the school. In July 2009, Olivier and several of the teachers resigned from their posts for undisclosed reasons. Olivier was replaced by Piano Foster, an educator with Scientology associations; Foster began at the school on July 1, 2009. Piano Foster has participated in Scientology courses. Foster completed the Scientology class, Basic Study Manual, at the Scientology Celebrity Center in 2005. Olivier was let go from her US$200,000 position, due to disagreements over teaching methodologies to utilize at the school. A representative for Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith told the New York Post, \\"Jacquie is no longer at the school for reasons entirely unrelated to curriculum. She is an excellent educator and fully embraced the school's secular and open-minded approach to innovative teaching methodologies.\\" The New York Post reported that Olivier left the school, due to conflicts with the Smiths over the Scientology \\"Study Tech\\" teaching methodologies. Foster confirmed she had been placed as the new administrator for the school, and stated, \\"I officially took over on July 1, 2009, and I'm looking forward to the challenge. I feel I'm ready for the job.\\" Suri Cruise began attending in April 2009. According to the Smiths, the school has no religious affiliation.

Birth and education Purser was born at Castle Hill, New South Wales, the eldest son of bootmaker and later orchardist James Purser, and his Scottish wife Mary Ann, n√©e Kyle. He attended school locally in Castle Hill and later at Newington College (1879-1881). At the end of 1881 he was named Dux of the College and received the inaugural Schofield Scholarship.Newington College Register of Past Students 1863-1998 (Syd, 1999) pp 161 In 1882 he went up to the University of Sydney and was a resident of St Andrew's College. Whilst at university he was captain of the cricket XI and was a noted athlete. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in 1885 and as a Bachelor of Medicine and Chemistry in 1890. Medical career After appointments as a resident medical officer and a medical superintendent at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Purser began private practice in Petersham in 1893. In the same year he married Louisa Victoria Brierley in the Congregational church. Louisa's sister Florence was Mrs A.B. Shand. Purser became an honorary at Royal Prince Alfred in 1896, and from 1912 until his death he was a consultant physician with rooms in Macquarie Street, Sydney. The prevention and treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis was his speciality. He was a member of the Tuberculosis Advisory Board and the New South Wales Board of Health and of the councils of the War Memorial Hospital, Waverley, and Crown Street Women's Hospital. He joined the board of the RPAH in 1909 and was vice-chairman for three years before his appointment as chairman in 1924. During his term of office the Rockefeller Building was constructed on the hospital campus. In 1933 he resigned as chairman of Prince Alfred due to his annoyance at the shortage of government financial support. On the foundation of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians in 1938, Purser was appointed a Fellow. Educational appointments Purser was elected to the senate of the University of Sydney in 1909 and was vice-chancellor in 1917, 1918 and 1923. In 1924 and 1925 he served as deputy chancellor. He was an examiner within the faculty of medicine for 19 years from 1911. Purser served on the councils of St Andrew's College, Wesley College, (where the Cecil Purser Wing (1943) is named in his honour), The Women's College, Newington College, and was for a term president of the Old Newingtonians' Union. Community involvement From 1893 he was a member of the Royal Society of New South Wales and for a term chaired the public health and kindred sciences section of the Society. Purser was honorary major in the Australian Army Medical Corps Reserve.

A report by the War Ministry led the celebrated Belgian military architect Henri Alexis Brialmont (who made several visits to Bucharest, meeting with King Carol I in the process) to draft a plan for the city's fortifications, with construction beginning in 1884. The forts, about 4 km apart, cost 111.5 million gold lei (15 million were initially allocated), or three times the annual army budget. The forts took over two decades to build, and work was quite complex; the walls are two metres thick in places. All eighteen were linked by a road and a railway, which today is DN100, Bucharest's ring road. Eighteen subterranean batteries were placed between the forts, and the fortification ring included some 240 pieces of artillery in all. Romania, which had recently won its independence from the Ottoman Empire, undertook this enormous effort in keeping with the prevailing military doctrine of the day, which said the capital city should be defended at all costs. In case of invasion, Bucharest was to be the point of retreat, but also the place where significant military operations would begin, spreading from the Danube to the Carpathians. At the beginning of the 20th century, chemical and aeronautical advances rendered the forts obsolete soon after their completion. Explosives and aerial bombardment made classical fortifications useless in modern warfare. In 1914, the Battle of Li√®ge, in which the German Army broke through fortifications also designed by Brialmont with greater ease than expected, alarmed the authorities in Bucharest. The forts' artillery pieces--all top-notch Krupp cannons--were quickly dismantled and transformed into mobile artillery. By 1916, when the German Army was approaching Bucharest, the forts had already been abandoned, and the city was taken without much difficulty. CƒÉ»õelu Today, the military has abandoned most of the forts. Stray dogs seek shelter in some of them; storage space and mushroom-growing facilities are other reported uses. During the Communist era, Fort 18 in Chiajna was used as a pickled goods market. However, the military still employs some of the forts, those to the southwest of the city in particular. They serve as firing ranges and munitions deposits, also housing army units; civilians are forbidden entry. The best-known fort is number 13, at Jilava--a military prison from 1907, a feared destination for political prisoners and place of execution during the Communist era, and now still a penitentiary. Another well-known fort--and the most visited one--is Battery 9-10, located in CƒÉ»õelu, to the south-east of Bucharest. Notes Further reading * Cornel I. Scafe»ô, Ioan I.

Broders' illustrations were distinctive for their simple lines and bold, flat areas of color, combined with noticeable graphical perspective showing the featured mountains and seascapes in the background. Broders' illustrations depicting people show active elongated figures wearing elegant, contemporary clothes. His posters were simply and boldly lettered identifying the destination, and were supplemented with a brief slogan. The Paris Lyon Mediteran√©e Company (PLM), a railway, commissioned Broders' poster art, sponsoring his travel so he could visit the subjects of his work. From 1922 to 1932, Broders fully dedicated himself to poster art, though overall he produced fewer than 100 posters. Lithographs of Broders' travel posters are still available commercially. See for instance Christie's London Ski Sale on 21 January 2010. Others are shown in the book about Railway Posters, published in Munich in 2011 and listed below.

If a sensitive indicating instrument is used, very little current is drawn from the source of the unknown voltage. Since the reference voltage can be produced from an accurately calibrated voltage divider, a potentiometer can provide high precision in measurement. The method was described by Johann Christian Poggendorff around 1841 and became a standard laboratory measuring technique. In this arrangement, a fraction of a known voltage from a resistive slide wire is compared with an unknown voltage by means of a galvanometer. The sliding contact or wiper of the potentiometer is adjusted and the galvanometer briefly connected between the sliding contact and the unknown voltage. The deflection of the galvanometer is observed and the sliding tap adjusted until the galvanometer no longer deflects from zero. At that point the galvanometer draws no current from the unknown source, and the magnitude of voltage can be calculated from the position of the sliding contact. This null balance measuring method is still important in electrical metrology and standards work and is also used in other areas of electronics. Measurement potentiometers are divided into four main classes listed below.  Principle of operation  Dial potentiometer, with built-in galvanometer and reference voltage source The principle of a potentiometer is that the potential dropped across a segment of a wire of uniform cross-section carrying a constant current is directly proportional to its length. The potentiometer is a simple device used to measure the electrical potentials (or compare the e.m.f of a cell). One form of potentiometer is a uniform high-resistance wire attached to an insulating support, marked with a linear measuring scale. In use, an adjustable regulated voltage source E, of greater magnitude than the potential to be measured, is connected across the wire so as to pass a steady current through it. Between the end of the wire and any point along it will be a potential proportional to the length of wire to that point. By comparing the potential at points along the wire with an unknown potential, the magnitude of the unknown potential can be determined. The instrument used for comparison must be sensitive, but need not be particularly well-calibrated or accurate so long as its deflection from zero position can be easily detected.  Constant current potentiometer  A potentiometer being calibrated and then measuring an unknown voltage. R1 is the resistance of the entire resistance wire. The arrow head represents the moving wiper. In this circuit, the ends of a uniform resistance wire R1 are connected to a regulated DC supply VS for use as a voltage divider. The potentiometer is first calibrated by positioning the wiper (arrow) at the spot on the R1 wire that corresponds to the voltage of a standard cell so that {R_2 \\\\over R_1} = {\\\\mbox{cell voltage} \\\\over V_\\\\mathrm{S}} A standard electrochemical cell is used whose emf is known (e.g. 1.0183 volts for a Weston standard cell).Kenyon.edu Dept of Physics.scenta.co.uk Scenta. The supply voltage VS is then adjusted until the galvanometer shows zero, indicating the voltage on R2 is equal to the standard cell voltage. An unknown DC voltage, in series with the galvanometer, is then connected to the sliding wiper, across a variable-length section R3 of the resistance wire. The wiper is moved until no current flows into or out of the source of unknown voltage, as indicated by the galvanometer in series with the unknown voltage. The voltage across the selected R3 section of wire is then equal to the unknown voltage. The final step is to calculate the unknown voltage from the fraction of the length of the resistance wire that was connected to the unknown voltage. The galvanometer does not need to be calibrated, as its only function is to read zero or not zero. When measuring an unknown voltage and the galvanometer reads zero, no current is drawn from the unknown voltage and so the reading is independent of the source's internal resistance, as if by a voltmeter of infinite resistance. Because the resistance wire can be made very uniform in cross-section and resistivity, and the position of the wiper can be measured easily, this method can be used to measure unknown DC voltages greater than or less than a calibration voltage produced by a standard cell without drawing any current from the standard cell. If the potentiometer is attached to a constant voltage DC supply such as a lead‚Äìacid battery, then a second variable resistor (not shown) can be used to calibrate the potentiometer by varying the current through the R1 resistance wire. If the length of the R1 resistance wire is AB, where A is the (-) end and B is the (+) end, and the movable wiper is at point X at a distance AX on the R3 portion of the resistance wire when the galvanometer gives a zero reading for an unknown voltage, the distance AX is measured or read from a pre-printed scale next to the resistance wire. The unknown voltage can then be calculated: V_U = (Calibration \\\\ Cell \\\\ Voltage) {AX \\\\over AB}  Constant resistance potentiometer  The constant resistance potentiometer is a variation of the basic idea in which a variable current is fed through a fixed resistor. These are used primarily for measurements in the millivolt and microvolt range.  Microvolt potentiometer  This is a form of the constant resistance potentiometer described above but designed to minimize the effects of contact resistance and thermal emf. This equipment is satisfactorily used down to readings of 1000 nV or so.  Thermocouple potentiometer  Another development of the standard types was the 'thermocouple potentiometer' especially adapted for temperature measurement with thermocouples. Kenyon.edu Dept of Physics. Thermodynamics: Thermocouple Potentiometer. Potentiometers for use with thermocouples also measure the temperature at which the thermocouple wires are connected, so that cold-junction compensation may be applied to correct the apparent measured EMF to the standard cold-junction temperature of 0 degrees C. Analytical chemistry To make a potentiometric determination of an analyte in a solution, the potential of the cell is measured. This measurement must be corrected for the reference and junction potentials. It can also be used in standardisation methods. The concentration of the analyte can then be calculated from the Nernst Equation. Many varieties of this basic principle exist for quantitative measurements. Metre bridge A metre bridge is a simple type of potentiometer which may be used in school science laboratories to demonstrate the principle of resistance measurement by potentiometric means. A resistance wire is laid along the length of a metre rule and contact with the wire is made through a galvanometer by a slider. When the galvanometer reads zero, the ratio between the lengths of wire to the left and right of the slider is equal to the ratio between the values of a known and an unknown resistor in a parallel circuit.

It is being produced by TMS Entertainment and was broadcast by NHK. Plot A bright and energetic young girl, Ran is introduced to her supernatural powers right along with her first year in junior high school. While she is troubled by her powers seeming to instigate ill fortune upon people in contact with her and illuminating their ill intentions in some cases, Ran soon learns to accommodate her supernatural abilities and accept herself as is with the support of her family and peers. Accompanied by Rui, Ran finds herself constantly embroiled in mysterious circumstances and events whose resolution requires that she learn to collaborate with Midori (another girl who also has supernatural powers). Characters =Main characters= ; :The protagonist in the story, Ran is introduced as a vivacious young lady having recently begun her first year in intermediate school where she engages in track and field as an extracurricular activity. Ran has always had a sense of insight about things that few other people can match. Ran is part of a traditional nuclear family (biological parents still married to each other) with an elder brother. She is in love with Rui. ; :Having been her long-standing childhood friend, Rui has artistic affinities and can easily detect when Ran is in distress about something when she starts up with the quick but brief laughing fits. Upon learning of her psychic powers, Rui indicates that he is fond of Ran for the person she is. He has the ability to neutralize and amplify psychic powers. He is frequently referred to as Ran's boyfriend, though neither of them deny the relationship. ; :A recent transfer student that possesses the same kind of supernatural powers that Ran herself does, Midori initially appears as an enemy, but Ran's kindness results in the two teaming up and working together as friends. Despite their friendship, Midori is difficult to get along with, due to her large ego, her desire to be the center of attention, her obsession with money, and her schoolgirl crush on Ran's older brother. When she is not inviting herself on Ran and Rui's outings, participating in an eating contest, or helping to settle strange incidents, she is usually at home alone eating cuttlefish and watching historical dramas. Midori is less powerful, but showing a better control in psychic powers than Ran. She is also smart, intelligent, beautiful and strong. She even able to defeat bull in a contest. =Secondary characters= ; :Given how he is dressed most of the time and that he is introduced while doing housework, Rin is Ran's elder brother and is most likely in high school. Always having thought of Ran as being a little weird, Rin is not surprised to learn of his little sister's supernatural powers and wishes that he had some as well. Rin is the first to draw a preliminary correlation with the mysterious events at the start of the series and will likely become indispensable in the future for this reason considering how he has coached Ran through using her powers and helping to interpret what she learns through that means. ; :A novelist whose writer's block is broken by the idea to combine a horrific murder with a comedy show, Reina is Ran's mother and has aspirations to be a super-popular horror novelist. ; :Introduced as having a twelve-year history in a nukazuke company, a Japanese type of pickle, Ron is Ran's father and seems to have an affinity for advocating the virtues of lactic acid bacilli in the pickled vegetable chips he makes. ; ; :Two young cats found by Ran while kittens, abandoned by their mother or previous owner. They seem to share a strong bond with her and often accompany her to bed. ; :Saeko is Ran's academically- oriented classmate and best friend that is astonished that Ran secured a flawless score on a test in spite of her ignorance of the test material. Ran's explanation attempts greatly scare Saeko greatly since she had not yet vocalized her thoughts. Saeko's most prominent role is near the beginning of the series when her resentful dedication to rigorously studying in order to show up Ran who just happened to have serendipity (and perhaps the knowledge of how to take advantage of the testing format) on her side prompts Momoko to wield Saeko as a bodyguard to inhibit Ran rushing to Rui's rescue. A judo flip from Rin is more than enough to extinguish the subjugation. Adaptations =Anime= is the 2008 anime adaptation of the novel series Telepathy Sh≈çjo Ran Jiken Note.

It was developed by the Samurai in feudal Japan as a method of dispatching an armored (and often armed) opponent using unarmed techniques. According to the Densho (transmission scrolls) of various schools and historical records, these systems of unarmed combat began to be known as Jujutsu during the Muromachi period (1333‚Äì1568).  Early history  During the Edo period (1603‚Äì1868) several Jujutsu styles became paramount. These schools (or ryu ÊµÅ) focused their activities on various techniques that their masters had developed over time. The Kyushin Ryu school specialised in systems of Atemi waza (striking techniques). The art was practiced by many sh≈çguns with the aim of refining methods of attacking the exposed target areas around the armour of their opponent. Credit for the foundation of the Kyushin Ryu school is given to Inugami Sakon-no-shokan Nagakatsu (Áä¨‰∏äÊ∞∏Âãù) during the Eiroku period (1558‚Äì1570). Nagakatsu was a Samurai from the Hikone area within the ancient kuni (or provence) of ≈åmi, a holding of the Ii clan. He worked as an Imperial Palace guard in nearby Kyoto. After receiving reiken (ÈúäÂâ£ spirit sword) from his father Inugami Hyogonosuke (Heiko) Nagatsugu, he studied with Hayamizu Nagakado-no-kami Enshin, from whom he received menkyo in Kumiuchi (grappling with weapons). Enshin (also known as Hayami Naga Monmori Enshin) was a bodyguard (ÂåóÈù¢„ÅÆÊ≠¶Â£´ Hokumen-no-bushi) to Emperor ≈ågimachi from 1557 to 1586 and densho of his teachings along with densho and kuden (spoken teachings) from Inugami's family eventually formed the art of Enshin Ryu. Inukami District, just outside Hikone, Japan still bears the family name and contains one of the most famous shrines Taga-taisha, in the Shiga Prefecture. Inugami went on to found his own ryu with a special focus on the core principles: * Atemi waza ‚Äì striking techniques * Katsu waza (or Kappo) ‚Äì methods of resuscitation and first aid His son, Inugami Gunbei (Kyushinsai) Nagatomo developed the Kyushin Ryu curriculum further and established it in Ky≈´sh≈´. Here, it became a highly regarded school and was known by a number of variant writings (of the first character, \\"kyu\\"). It contained techniques for grappling, swordsmanship, and other weaponry. Inugami Gunbei Nagayasu (Áä¨‰∏äÊ∞∏‰øù), better known as Inugami Gunbei (grandson to Inugami Nagakatsu), attained great eminence in the art and developed it even further. So much so that he has also been deemed the originator of Kyushin Ryu. There is a great similarity between the principles of Kito Ryu and Kyushin Ryu and this has led to the suggestion that Kyushin Ryu had been derived (at least in part) from Kito Ryu. It is also said that in the second year of Kioho (1717) Inugami studied Kito Ryu under Takino which might also attribute to this similarity. Among those who were famous in Kyushin Ryu are; Ishino, Tsukamatyo and Eguchi. Kyushin Ryu was also known as Inugami Ryu (after the founder) and the Bugei Ryuha Daijiten (Ê≠¶Ëä∏ÊµÅÊ¥æÂ§ß‰∫ãÂÖ∏) or \\"Encyclopedia of Martial Art Schools\\" lists a Densho \\"Kyushin Ichiryu Jujutsu\\" (Êâ±ÂøÉ‰∏ÄÊµÅ). A man by the name of Takahashi was awarded mokuroku in Meiji 14 (1881), by a panel including Inugami (descendant of the founder), Ishino, Iwahashi and Kobayashi. Takahashi is believed to be the grandson of master Takahashiihyoei Mitsumasa (Takahashi Inobei), founder of Nanba Ippo Ryu. A famous tale about Inugami Gunbei was published in \\"The Idler\\", London in October 1892: > One day Inugami Gunbei, a celebrated teacher of the Kyushin school, met > Onogawa Kisabur≈ç, the most famous wrestler of the time, in a teahouse. They > drank sake together, and Onogawa began to brag, whereupon Inugami said that > even a great wrestler might not be able to defeat an old man like himself. > The angry wrestler proposed a trial of strength. Onogawa took hold of > Inugami saying, \\"Can you escape?\\" Inugami replied, \\"Of course, if you do not > hold me more tightly.\\" So Onogawa grasped him more firmly, and repeated his > question. He did this three times, and when Inugami said, \\"Can you do no > more?\\" Onogawa, relaxing his grip to take a firmer hold, was in a moment > pitched over upon his honourable back by Inugami. This he did twice. Onogawa > was so much surprised that he became Inugami's pupil. Inugami also taught > Onogawa how to overcome an enemy by falling down and tripping him up.  Modern era  Dai Nippon Butokukai July 24, 1906 Kodokan Kata Syllabus working group - Shihan Eguchi pictured front row second from left (also pictured from Kyushin Ryu is Hidemi Tozuka - front row fourth from right - who went on to study Yoshin Ryu) The most noteworthy master of Kyushin Ryu Jujutsu in more recent times is Shihan Yoshinori (Yazo) Eguchi (Ê±üÂè£ÂΩå‰∏â) of Kumamoto Prefecture, who received recognition during the formative stages of modern Judo in the early 1880s (Meiji period 1868-1912). In 1895, Governor Watanabe of Kyoto Prefecture met with the masters of the prominent schools and established the Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (Greater Japan Martial Virtue Society). This was the first official Japanese martial arts institution authorised by the Ministry of Education and endorsed by the Meiji Emperor. It was here in 1906, that Dr Jigoro Kano (ÂòâÁ¥ç Ê≤ª‰∫îÈÉé Kan≈ç Jigor≈ç, 1860‚Äì1938) founder of Judo, selected techniques from the more influential Jujutsu schools: * Tenjin Shin'y≈ç-ry≈´ (stemming from Yoshin Ryu) * Yoshin ryu * Shiten ryu * Sekiguchi Ryu * Sosuishi Ryu * Fusen Ryu * Kito Ryu (unknown possibly having Chinese influence) * Takenouchi Ryu * Miura Ryu (Yoshin Ryu derived) * Tsutsumi H≈çzan- ry≈´ * Kyushin Ryu Eguchi Shihan became one of Dr Kano's closest disciples during these early years and it was also at about this time that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department (founded in 1874) chose the techniques of Kyushin Ryu Jujutsu as part of their officer combat and defence training schedules. Eguchi Shihan with EW Barton-Wright demonstrating a defensive technique Eguchi Shihan demonstrating a jujutsu takedown technique Edward William Barton-Wright, founder of Bartitsu trained with Eguchi Shihan, although it is not known to what extent. Barton-Wright appears in many early photos with Eguchi Shihan and performed numerous public demonstrations with him and other martial arts exponents of the time. Ry≈çgor≈ç Uchida, Chief of the Prefectural Police (also a student of Kyushin Ryu, under Ishikawa) held such events where jujutsu and judo were performed, along with weapons such as the naginata and katana. Eguchi Shihan demonstrating a rear defense techniqueMinehiko Nakano (b. 1912 d. 2000) of Yamaguchi Prefecture (Â±±Âè£Áúå, Yamaguchi-ken) was Uchi-deshi (ÂÜÖÂºüÂ≠ê:„ÅÜ„Å°„Åß„Åó) to Eguchi Shihan and received full transmission, including the secret techniques of Kyushin Ryu. In the Kodokan he was graded directly to nidan, reflecting his existing jujutsu credentials and a short time later was promoted directly to godan. This was extremely unorthodox as the Kodokan are noted for their strict adherence to tsukinami shiai (monthly tournaments) and you had to demonstrate a high level of skill in order to skip dan levels. Nakano was eventually promoted to hachidan (8th dan) in Kodokan Judo, being amongst the most proven and respected top-level players and instructors. At the conclusion of World War 2, he resided in the city of Iwakuni (Â≤©ÂõΩÂ∏Ç, Iwakuni-shi) near Hiroshima. This later became the site of a United States Marine Corps Air Base, where he was persuaded to interact with the Americans and teach them the art of Jujutsu.  In Australia  One member of the Australian occupational forces was Mr Ray Stevens of Brisbane. He too, studied under Nakano, and brought the art to Brisbane, Queensland in the early 1950s. Here, he joined with Dr Arthur John (Jack) Ross to pass on his knowledge of Jujutsu to several well-known martial arts practitioners; John Lee Jones, Desmond de Vene, Jim Stackpoole and Joe Elkenhans to name but a few. Ross, who founded the first Judo school in Australia (the Brisbane Judo Club) in 1928, went to Japan in 1901 aged 8. He was coached in Kodokan judo by EJ Harrison, and received his shodan grading before leaving for England to study medicine. Ross subsequently emigrated to Australia. Shihan Jim Stackpoole, currently the head of Kyushin Ryu Jujitsu in Australia, also traveled to Japan to study under Minehiko Nakano. He was awarded shodan in 1968 after competing in the Yamaguchi Prefecture championships, and nidan in 1974 by Nakano Shihan. He has registered his school with the Australian government recognised Australian Jujitsu Federation Inc., and is presently a member of the Executive Council of that organisation. Apart from some adaptations to various techniques by other Jujutsu schools, the Kyushin Ryu School of Jujitsu is the only follower of the original Kyushin Ryu style in existence today. While the traditional techniques expounded by Eguchi Shihan have been retained, various aspects of the art have been influenced by the changing times, especially in relation to safety. NOTE: Jujutsu spelled \\"Jujitsu\\" is how the Australian line of the school has chosen to spell the art. There are other common romanizations of the art in the West, whereas the modern Hepburn romanization is \\"j≈´jutsu.\\" Some of the other spellings used are Jiu-jitsu, Ju-Jitsu, Ju jitsu and so-on.  Worldwide  A school was established in London in the 1940s, however this was eventually disbanded. An association was set up in 1973 covering Kent, and later Sussexhttp://www.kyushinryujujitsuwestsussex.com/history.htmlhttp://www.kyushinryu.com/KRJJA/History.html, thriving to this day. There are also other martial arts around the world using the same (or similar) Kyushin Ryu name. Some of these schools teach variants of karate, aiki-jutsu, aikido, kenjutsu, judo and even jujutsu but do not represent the original school founded by Nagakatsu. One of the main reasons this has arisen is that the first two syllables 'kyu' and 'shin' can be written differently in Japanese to give alternate meanings. Furthermore, other schools that originated from, or have a link to the Japanese island of Ky≈´sh≈´ have been known to use Kyushin in the name.  Meaning of the name  The name \\"Kyushin (Ichi) Ryu\\" may be broken into syllables: * Êâ± - Ky≈´ - collect, draw in, gather * ÂøÉ - Shin - core, soul * ‰∏Ä - Ichi - (as prefix to Ryu, meaning first class, foremost) * ÊµÅ - Ry≈´ - flow, a style (school of thought) Note: the no-longer used combination of \\"Ichi-Ryu\\" referred to the aristocratic class of society who practiced Kyushin Ryu Jujutsu, rather than implying the school was more \\"superior\\" than any other. The older members of Japanese aristocracy were attracted to the ease of application of the lethal Kyushin Ryu techniques. Many sh≈çguns realised that Atemi waza would provide a quick result in their favour, without the extremely high levels of physical endurance required to apply other Jujutsu styles. \\"Kyushin Ryu Jujitsu\\" may also be translated as Supreme level of Jujitsu. The word \\"supreme\\" refers to the class of the aristocracy, rather than a vain comparison with other Jujitsu styles. As the Shogun were regarded as within the highest level of Japanese society of the era, this is reflected in the choice of the star as the prominent feature of the emblem.  Emblem  The Kyushin Ryu Jujitsu Emblem The Kyushin Ryu Jujutsu emblem emanated from research conducted by Eguchi Shihan when, in the latter part of the 19th century, he endeavored to record many of the Jujutsu techniques practised within the Kyushin Ryu system. His study on the history of Kyushin Ryu focused on the formalisation and documentation of the school that took place during the Eiroku period (1558‚Äì1570), when five prominent Jujutsu schools pooled their knowledge to form the Kyushin Ryu system. Acknowledgement of the input from each school was symbolised by a five-pointed star. So that no school received more acknowledgment than the others, the star was drawn in such a manner that none of the five branches of the star actually formed a point. Each branch of the star has a curved appearance, reminiscent of the cherry blossom flower (or Sakura), revered in Japan. The red circle in the middle depicts the red sun which is representative of Japan - the land of the rising sun. The red colour of the star symbolises the reference to the \\"blood sport\\" of fights to the death, and the black outline reveres the \\"master level\\" belt attainable by Kyushin Ryu practitioners. The sh≈çguns were regarded amongst the highest levels of Japanese society during their time, and was reflected in the choice of a star as the prominent feature of the badge.

Released for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita and Microsoft Windows, the game centers on the extraterrestrial Frank and a purple, amorphous creature called The Maw, who have crash-landed their spacecraft on an alien planet. The player assumes the role of Frank and directs The Maw‚Äîwhich can take on the abilities of objects and fauna it consumes‚Äîvia a leash. The game won the 2008 Audience Choice award at PAX10, and was a finalist at the 2009 Independent Games Festival. As of year-end 2011, The Maw had sold more than 237,000 units. Synopsis and gameplay In The Maw characters Frank (right) and The Maw (left) must team up to escape capture from bounty hunters. The Maw is set in a futuristic universe. The game begins with Frank, a pacifist bipedal alien, and The Maw, a purple one-eyed creature with small- medium teeth, both having been captured by the Galactic Bounty Hunters. For unknown reasons the ship on which they are being held crash lands on a strange planet, killing all the crew. Alone, they set out for a communications tower in the distance while on the run from additional Galactic Bounty Hunters who have come to recapture them. In The Maw players control Frank, who in turn controls The Maw via an electrical leash that he uses to keep him at his side. Gameplay involves guiding The Maw in specific directions to clear obstacles and complete levels. The Maw also has the ability to eat objects and creatures, taking on some of the properties of the thing it eats, such as breathing fire, flying, or simply growing in size. Players then use The Maw's increased abilities to navigate previously impossible sections of a level. Development and marketing Twisted Pixel Games announced in June 2008 its plans to release The Maw as it's the first original title for the company. Previously the company had worked with Midway Games to develop the 2004 game NBA Ballers. Technically The Maw is a reference or homage to Halo 1's final level of the campaign titled The Maw. Hothead Games, a Vancouver-based independent video game developer, teamed with Twisted Pixel Games to bring The Maw to Microsoft Windows. It was released for the PC on March 9, 2009. The Maw soundtrack was composed by Winifred Phillips and produced by Winnie Waldron, who together designed the music interactivity for the game. =Downloadable content = Twisted Pixel announced that a total of three new levels would be released for the game as downloadable content, Brute Force, River redirect, and The Speeder Lane. Once downloaded, the new levels are selectable from the in-game menu as \\"deleted scenes\\", taking place at various points between original levels in the storyline. Brute Force and River Redirect were released for Xbox 360 on February 18, 2009 and March 11, 2009 respectively. Both were released together for the Steam version of the game on March 16, 2009. The Speeder Lane was released on April 30, 2009. When interviewed by Gamasutra, Twisted Pixel CEO Michael Wilford revealed that though the developers had plans for downloadable content from the beginning, decisions on what would be included in that content were not made until after the game was released. \\"[We] didn't work on them in any way until after the main game was wrapped,\\" stated Wilford. \\"Once the game was out of our hands, we went back to the drawing board to design everything from scratch, but we obviously had a lot of half-finished pieces on the cutting room floor that we could leverage.\\" Wilford further explained that due to the way The Maw ends extending past the ending would not be possible. Therefore, plans were made for the downloadable content to be dubbed \\"Deleted Scenes\\"; levels that take place inside the story of the main game. Wilford was quick to note that these levels were not simply unlock codes that provided the player with access to things already in the game. \\"I think some people took it to mean that we intentionally stripped out levels that were 100 percent complete only to sell them as DLC,\\" he said, adding that it was \\"not the case.\\" Reception The Maw received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. IGN's Erik Brudvig praised the game, citing colorful graphics and easy yet fun gameplay. Brudvig also praised its music, stating \\"The soundtrack is excellent and fits the feel of the game perfectly.\\" Phillip Kollar of GamesRadar+ lauded the Xbox 360 version's character designs, calling Frank and The Maw \\"adorable main characters.\\" Kollar further expressed appreciation for the ability to learn to play the game without tutorial levels. TeamXboxs Dale Nardozzi lauded the gameplay, visuals and audio, stating \\"Roll [them] together and you have one very tasty yumyum, not to mention one of the better original IP‚Äôs to hit Xbox Live Arcade .\\" Criticism of The Maw typically pointed to the game's short play time. Edge stated that the Xbox 360 version was fun \\"while it lasts\\", a sentiment which Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot shared. Game Revolution's Eduardo Reboucas also agreed, stating, \\"Enjoy it while it lasts, though, because Maw's stay isn't a very long one.\\" Brudvig added, \\"The game can easily be beaten in a weekend of light playing. Some might play again to find everything, but most will call it a day.\\" The game won the 2008 Audience Choice award at PAX10, and was a finalist at the Independent Games Festival 2009. The Maw sold over 34,000 copies its first week of release, in May 2009 sales increased to 95,000 units, and by October of the same year had sold over 113,000 copies. Although sales slowed during the winter, the game still sold over one 144,000 units as of the end of January 2010. As of year-end 2010, The Maw had moved more than 169,000 units with its downloadable content selling more than 52,000 units collectively. Sales as of year-end 2011 were over 237,000 units on Xbox Live Arcade. Collective sales of downloadable content exceeded a total of 60,000 units that same year. Gamasutra also awarded the game with an honorable mention in its Top 5 Console Downloadable Games of 2009.

Lyon (September 13, 1887 ‚Äì July 20, 1960) was an American attorney from California who served as a Republican in the California State Assembly and the California State Senate. Lyon was Assembly Speaker from 1943 to 1946. Lyon was admitted to the bar in 1910 and was first elected to the Assembly in 1914.LA Times, C.W. Lyon Services Set Tomorrow,\\" 1960-07-22, p. B-28. Lyon served numerous terms in the Senate and Assembly and authored the legislation creating the UCLA campus.LA Times, \\"Ex-Assembly Speaker Charles W. Lyon Dies,\\" 1960-07-21, p. B-7 Early life and career; fraternal activities Lyon was born in Los Angeles on September 13, 1887. He was the eighth of nine children of James H. and Laura Emma (Simpson) Lyon, who had moved to California from Maine. The family was distantly related to John Alden and to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. James Lyon was a carpenter foreman and architect. Charles attended the public schools in Los Angeles and San Francisco, then studied law at night while working for the Title Insurance and Trust Company in Los Angeles; he had begun working for the company at the age of fifteen. He was admitted to the California Bar at the age of 23 in 1910. He then went into private practice as a member of the firm of Fredericks & Hanna. He married Nancy Janney, daughter of a well known Utah mining engineer on September 21, 1912, and the couple would have three children. At age 21, Lyon was elected president of Los Angeles Parlor No. 45 of the Native Sons of the Golden West. Lyon became state president of the California State Aerie of Eagles, which then had over thirty thousand members in California. In 1919, he was elected exalted ruler for 1919‚Äì20 of Santa Monica Elks Lodge. Political career In 1914, Lyon became City Attorney of Venice, California, where he and his family were living as of 1921. Later that year, Lyon was elected to the California State Assembly as a Republican, and was reelected in 1916. While in the Assembly, he opposed the Populist reforms being enacted at that time. In 1918, he ran for the State Senate, and was elected. He remained in the Senate until defeated for re- election in 1930. After two years out of office, Lyon ran for and was elected to the Assembly again, and would serve there until 1946. In the Assembly, he feared that Governor Frank Merriam would move to the left in response to the Depression, and actively opposed Merriam's Democratic successor, Culbert Olson. While Lyon's 1938 re-election did not get any especial note at the time, it is remembered today because of the later careers of the opponents whom he defeated. Lyon cross-filed, running in both the Republican and Democratic primaries, and secured his re-election by defeating future Richard Nixon campaign manager Murray Chotiner in the Republican poll, and narrowly beating Robert A. Heinlein (who subsequently turned to writing science fiction) in the Democratic contest. (fee for article) Heinlein's political short story, \\"A Bathroom of Her Own\\" is based on Heinlein's own political experiences in the race against Lyon. In 1939, Lyon became Assembly minority leader. The following year, during the special session, Republicans and conservative Democrats formed a ruling coalition, and Lyon became Chairman of the Rules Committee. The Republicans won a majority in the Assembly in 1942, and Lyon was elected Speaker the following year, a post he held for two terms. By this time, Republican Earl Warren had defeated Olson for reelection, and Lyon cooperated with Warren on such issues as postwar planning. In 1946, Lyon ran unsuccessfully for the position of Lieutenant Governor of California. In 1950, he recaptured a seat in the Assembly, and was reelected in 1952. Scandal and later life Lyon's political career ended in scandal when, in 1954, he was convicted in connection with a liquor license bribery scheme in Southern California. Lyon was convicted of grand theft and conspiracy to commit grand theft. Lyon was paroled on November 5, 1956, after serving 18 months of a 5-year sentence at San Luis Obispo's Men's Colony.LA Times, \\"Former Speaker Lyon Released From Prison,\\" 1956-11-06, p. A-8. In 1958, he was pardoned by Governor Goodwin Knight. He spent his final years as a lobbyist for the Southern California Merchants Association. Lyon died of cancer in July 1960, in Beverly Hills, California. In December 1961, Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown pardoned Lyon's fellow conspirator, former Assembly Member Delbert Morris.LA Times, \\"Ex-Legislator Wins Pardon in Liquor Scandal,\\" 1961-12-22, p. 5.

His co- conducting, with the composer, of the premiere of Britten's War Requiem, at the re-consecration of Coventry Cathedral on 30 May 1962, is generally regarded as one of the highlights of British 20th-century choral music. Biography Meredith Davies was born in Birkenhead, Cheshire, the second son of a clergyman. At the age of seven he became a junior exhibitioner at the Royal College of Music in London, as a cellist. He went to the Stationers' Company's School, North London. He soon showed an interest in the organ, and was taken as a pupil by George Thalben-Ball. At age 17 he served as organist at Hurstpierpoint College for a year, before being elected in 1940 as organ scholar of Keble College, Oxford. Studies for his Philosophy, Politics and Economics degree were interrupted by war service with the Royal Artillery, 1942‚Äì45. After demobilisation, in 1947 he took up the first of his two cathedral appointments, as organist and Master of the Choristers at St Albans. He moved to Hereford Cathedral in 1949 as organist and choirmaster, in succession to Sir Percy Hull, staying there until 1956. This entailed being conductor of the Three Choirs Festival in 1952 and 1955. His performances at the festival included a memorable The Dream of Gerontius with an ailing Kathleen Ferrier. Having been encouraged by Sir Adrian Boult to become a full- time conductor, he went to the Accademia di Santa Cecilia in Rome in 1954 and 1956 to study conducting with Fernando Previtali. He returned to Oxford in 1956, to spend three years as organist and supernumerary fellow of New College, Oxford. He then became conductor of the City of Birmingham Choir. In 1957 he was appointed assistant conductor to Andrzej Panufnik at the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra and was being groomed to be his successor. In 1960, when Panufnik resigned because of ill-health, Davies was offered the post, but declined, feeling he was not yet ready for the responsibility. Nevertheless, he became deputy musical director. He cut his operatic teeth with Colin Davis's Chelsea Opera Group, and conducted Berlioz's La damnation de Faust in 1958, Mozart's Idomeneo in 1962 and Rossini's Il barbiere di Siviglia in 1963. During the 1959‚Äì60 Birmingham season, Davies took over the conducting of Britten's Spring Symphony from the composer, who was unwell. Britten was so impressed that he invited him to conduct The Rape of Lucretia and The Turn of the Screw at the 1960 and 1961 Aldeburgh Festivals. Davies resigned from the deputy musical directorship in Birmingham in 1960, and made a very successful Covent Garden debut in November, conducting Peter Grimes. His handling of the big choral ensembles received particular praise. Early in 1961 he conducted more performances of Peter Grimes before going to Vancouver in July for the North American premiere of A Midsummer Night's Dream. He conducted the Covent Garden production of that opera at the Edinburgh Festival, taking over from Georg Solti, and in December conducted it in London. The following year Davies conducted Delius's A Village Romeo and Juliet for Sadler's Wells Opera (now English National Opera) and travelled to Buenos Aires for the South American premiere of A Midsummer Night's Dream. In 1963 Davies became music director of Britten's English Opera Group (EOG) for two years. He also conducted new works by Richard Rodney Bennett, Humphrey Searle and R. W. Wood at the Cheltenham Festivals. He also conducted Britten's The Rape of Lucretia, A Midsummer Night's Dream, Albert Herring, The Turn of the Screw, Let's Make an Opera and Britten's version of The Beggar's Opera, either on tour, at Aldeburgh, or at Sadler's Wells Theatre when the EOG visited London. =Premiere of Britten's War Requiem, May 1962= Davies had by now had a significant association with Benjamin Britten. Britten's original intention was to conduct the War Requiem himself. Davies was engaged to prepare the large chorus, drawn from all over the diocese. When Britten, following a minor operation, arrived in Coventry for final rehearsals, he found the acoustics unsatisfactory, cathedral staff unco-operative, and the chorus on the verge of walking out when an attempt was made to reduce their numbers because of lack of space. Meanwhile, the Soviet government refused, on political grounds, to allow the intended soprano soloist Galina Vishnevskaya to take part, and her part had to be learned at ten days' notice by Heather Harper. As the premiere neared, it became evident that Britten was uncomfortable about directing the performance himself. Alternative conductors such as Georg Solti and Carlo Maria Giulini were suggested, but Britten proposed that Meredith Davies would conduct the orchestra, chorus and Heather Harper, and Britten himself would conduct the chamber orchestra accompanying the two male soloists (Peter Pears, Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau) and the Melos Ensemble. The performance was a triumph and is still considered a landmark in British 20th-century music. Britten and Davies also shared the conducting at the first London performance in Westminster Abbey, but thereafter Davies often conducted the work by himself. Late in 1963 Davies conducted Francis Poulenc's Dialogues des Carm√©lites at Covent Garden. In September 1964, he led the EOG on an historic tour of the Soviet Union, visiting Leningrad, Riga and Moscow. That year he was appointed musical director of the Vancouver Symphony Orchestra and stayed in that post until 1971, broadening its repertory considerably. He conducted several concerts by the Hall√© during its 1976 visit to the Hong Kong Festival. He was also chief conductor of the BBC Training Orchestra, musical director of the Royal Choral Society and conductor of the Leeds Philharmonic Society. He was Principal of Trinity College of Music 1979‚Äì88, President of the Incorporated Society of Musicians 1985‚Äì86, and Chairman of the Delius Trust 1991‚Äì97. Other premieres Davies conducted a number of other important, mainly British, premieres: *Anthony Milner's cantata St Francis, with the City of Birmingham Chorus and Symphony Orchestra (1959) *Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's 1914 cantata The Eternal Gospel, with his Birmingham forces (1960) *Malcolm Williamson's English Eccentrics, a setting of the book by Edith Sitwell (1964 Aldeburgh Festival) *Alan Bush's Variations, Nocturne and Finale on an English Sea Song, revised version (1965 Cheltenham Festival) *Lennox Berkeley's one-act opera Castaway, with the EOG (1967) *Jonathan Harvey's Benedictus (1970) *Puccini's operetta La rondine, with June Bronhill in the title role, at Covent Garden (1974) *Alexander Goehr's Arden Must Die, with the New Opera Company at Sadler's Wells (1974) *Anthony Milner's Symphony No 2, with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra (late 1970s) *the revival of Thea Musgrave's Mary Queen of Scots for Scottish Opera (1980) *Thea Musgrave's Chaucer settings, Triptych, with the London Symphony Orchestra at the Proms *David Matthews' Oboe Concerto (1992), with Nicholas Daniel and London Schools Symphony Orchestra. Recordings Meredith Davies made the premiere recordings of Ralph Vaughan Williams's Riders to the Sea and Sir John in Love. Frederick Delius was another speciality: he made the premiere recording of the Requiem (in 1968, 52 years after the work was written and 46 years after it was first performed), and he also recorded A Village Romeo and Juliet, Fennimore and Gerda, the Idyll, and the Violin Concerto (with Yehudi Menuhin). Personal In 1949 he married Betty Hazel Bates and they had three sons (one deceased) and a daughter. A further daughter, from a longstanding relationship with Cara Lancaster, also survives him. He died in New Alresford, England on 9 March 2005. Honours In 1982 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire CBE.

Tamu√≠n is internationally renowned for three archaeological sites representative of the precolonial Huastec culture. Toponymy The name Tamu√≠n has been spelled in many ways over time: Tamui, Tamuche, Tamuchi, Tam-Ohin, Tamo-Oxxi, Tam-Huinic, Tamuyn, Tamohi, Tamnoc. Its meaning is undetermined, and there have been many proposals about it, two of which being ‚Äúgar spot‚Äù (gar, a kind of fish) and ‚Äúmosquito spot‚Äù. Another suggestion holds that the original name is Tam-Huinic and that this translates as ‚Äúplace of the book of knowledge‚Äù. This meaning is suggestive of the fact that Tamu√≠n was the leading ceremonial center of the entire region of Huasteca. Yet another suggestion is that Tamuin is a corruption of the Huastec 'tamohi' meaning 'place of Ramon trees'. \\"An Archaeological Guide to Central and Southern Mexico\\" by Joyce & Jerry Kelly 2001. This is supported by Huastec origins from the moist south Huastec people where ramon nuts are common and a staple food. Location The municipality is situated in the eastern part of the State of San Luis Potos√≠ and belongs to the region known as Huasteca, a region which covers parts of several states. Tamu√≠n is bordered on the north by the state of Tamaulipas, on the south by the villages of San Vicente Tancuayalab and Tanlaj√°s, on the east by the municipio of √âbano, and on the west by Ciudad Valles. Hydrography The Tampa√≥n River runs through the middle of Tamu√≠n. It joins the Moctezuma River to form the P√°nuco River, which empties into the Gulf of Mexico. This region contains the following lagoons: Los Patitos, Tansey, Brasil, San Jos√© del Lim√≥n, Palmas Cortadas and Mirador. Climate The climate is hot for most of the year, turning to between cool and cold between November and February. History La Huasteca was the territory of the Wastek (Huastec) ethnicity, a branch of the Maya group of ethnicities. La Huasteca is detached from and far to the north of the main Maya region. Today, there are about 150,000 speakers of the Wastek language distributed between the states of San Luis Potos√≠ and the neighboring state of Veracruz. Tamu√≠n was the site of the first royal land lease (merced de tierra) in the portion of Huasteca which within the modern day state of San Luis Potos√≠. In 1555, the Viceroy ordered the alcalde mayor (magistrateLaw and Government in New Mexico History, Lesson 4) of P√°nuco not to hinder the fisheries of the Huastec tribe in Tamu√≠n and Tampico. In 1787, the Spanish empire's new system of intendancies was extended into Mexico. The old magistrate district of the Villa de los Valles was abolished and it was incorporated into the vast intendancy of San Luis Potos√≠, whose borders extended to Louisiana in the northeast, and Tamu√≠n continued in the administrative status of a simple village (pueblo). In 1793 the Franciscan friar, Fray Crist√≥bal Herrera Alcorcha described it in his report on the missions as the ‚ÄúSanctuary of Tamud or Tamu√≠n‚Äù. Under the constitution of the newly independent Mexican Republic, promulgated in 1824, the provinces of the former colony were transformed into \\"free and sovereign states\\".that is still the wording of the Mexican constitution The first constitution of the State of San Luis Potos√≠ was enacted by its constituent congress on 16 October 1826, and almost one year later, by decree No. 61 promulgated on 8 October 1827, several municipios of the state were designated, among them Tamu√≠n. Soon thereafter a law regulating municipios (the Ley de Arreglo de Municipios) was enacted, wherein the Villa of Tamu√≠n is mentioned as belonging to the division (partido) of Ciudad Valles. In March 1831, the lieutenant colonel of engineers, Francisco Pocelli, sailed up the P√°nuco River from Tampico in a steamboat and arrived at Tamu√≠n. This event was quite memorable for the region, since it was the first time a steamboat had traversed there. By a decree of 30 June 1845 issued by the Assembly of the Department of San Luis Potos√≠, the ayuntamiento (municipio government) of Tamu√≠n was transferred to the district of Valles. In this period, the village (pueblo) of Tamu√≠n was located further south than presently, at a site whose original name was El Choyal. In 1892, for the transfer of Tamu√≠n to the place called La Cofrad√≠a, the hacienda of El Lim√≥n was taken over. Its 19,000 hectares were distributed among 17 ejidos, giving each farmer (ejidatario) approximately 20 hectares on average. In 1955, the Villa of Tamu√≠n was inundated for nearly three weeks due to torrential rains caused by hurricanes Gladys and Hilda. During this crisis, the population was rendered incommunicado by damage to the town's highway. This disaster prompted president Adolfo Ruiz Cortinez to pay a visit to Tamu√≠n. Economy Agriculture: The most common crops are corn, sorghum, beans, sugar cane, papaya, and some produce. Animal Ranching: principally cattle, but also hogs, horses, sheep, and goats. Manufacturing: there is a cement plant of Grupo Cemex, two 260 MW electric generating stations operated by the AES Corporation, and a meat packing plant. Fishing: fisheries include gar, river carp, mojarra, shrimp, and acamaya (local variety of freshwater crayfish). There is a large, modern airport. Commercial flights are on a limited scale for security reasons. Archaeological sites The municipality of Tamu√≠n encompasses three of the most important sites of the Huastec culture: Tamtok, El Consuelo, and Tzintzin-Lujub. =Tamtok= Tamtok or Tamtoc is a site of the highest importance in the archaeological history of the Huasteca region. Situated in a plain within a large bend of the Tampa√≥n River and dominated by two great natural hills which are often at first glance mistaken for pyramids, the site comprises 50 small and medium sized mounds. There is a ceremonial plaza bordered by 23 buildings, with five platforms for conducting rituals occupying the center, which are surrounded by 13 round habitations and two rectangular, terraced large buildings which were probably for community use. The complex allows one to imagine what the religious life of the noble families of Tamtok must have been like. They may have believed in gods and practiced a fertility cult. Tamtok means place of the water clouds [sic] in the Wastek language. It occupies 133 hectares on the banks of the Tamu√≠n River, an hour's drive by highway from Ciudad Valles, San Luis Potos√≠. It was discovered at the end of the 19th century. In about 1937 the first report was made of archaeological monuments located in what was then the El Aserradero ranch, where Tamtok lies. In recent times, some have argued that the ancient city might have been as big as Teotihuac√°n. Between 1962 and 1965 the French archaeologist Stresser-P√©an surveyed the area and conducted partial excavations. The work of restoration began 6 August 2001. Up to that point, the site had been virtually unknown. With an investment of 18 million pesos, in these four years of work 70 structures have been stabilized out of 255 discovered. Tamtok enjoyed its period of maximum splendor between 200 y 1300 A.D., during which period its population rose to 4,000. To judge by the artefacts discovered, it was a well-organized society based on agriculture. In the complex, an urbanism unique in Mesoamerica has been identified. One characteristic that distinguishes Tamtok is the large presence of women. For example, 90 percent of the human remains discovered in the zone are women, and the great majority of the clay and ceramic figurines that have been found represent women. =El Consuelo= Situated southeast of the city of Tamu√≠n, El Consuelo is accessed by federal highway 70 in the direction of the Gulf port of Tampico. At kilometer 284 it connects with state highway 170. The site entrance is six kilometers down on state highway 170. The archaeological zone is known by the names Tamu√≠n, for the municipio, and El Consuelo, for the ranch which occupies the vicinity. The village of Tamu√≠n or Tamoh√≠, a word which means \\"place of effervescence\\" in Wastek, was built between the 8th and 16th centuries and was depopulated at the time of the Spanish conquest. Among the major archaeological zones of Huastecawhich runs from the south of Tamaulipas State east to the northern part of Veracruz State and south to the eastern parts of the States of San Luis Potos√≠ and Hidalgoare Tancol, Las Flores, Castillo de Teayo, Tantoc (Tamtok), Agua Nueva, and Yahualica. The El Consuelo site is representative of the Huastec culture in the last centuries of pre-Hispanic Mexico. The region's cultural development partook of the elements characteristic of the ancient cultures of North America. When its inhabitants dispersed during the first years of the conquest, they settled in the poblado known in today as Antiguo Tamu√≠n (Old Tamu√≠n), six kilometers from El Consuelo. The first mention of the site is due to Walter Staub, who in 1919 published an article with photographs of various sculptures. By 1946, the investigator Wilfrido Du Solier conducted excavations in El Consuelo ranch and in several buildings and discovered the so called Polychrome Altar. Work was discontinued until 1981 when numerous architectural elements were stabilized. In 1990 the work of exploring and reconstructing the Great Platform commenced. Among the most important objects encountered at the site are the sculpture, found in 1917, known as the Huastec Adolescent, probably a representation of the god Quetzalc√≥atl in his youth and considered one of the masterpieces of pre-Hispanic art in Huastec culture. Also important is the mural which covers one of the altars, in which is seen, in a series of images, personages with rich vestments. The figures are conspicuous for their originality and quality and the ceramic art of the Preclassic period. =Tzintzin-Lujub= Archaeological site today known as Agua Nueva, located within the ‚ÄúEl Hurac√°n‚Äù ranch, property of Celestino Rivera and Claudio S√°nchez, 18.7 kilometers from the highway between Tamu√≠n and San Vicente Tancuayalab.

He is best known for his work on the philosophy of the Church Fathers. He studied under G.E. Moore and Ludwig Wittgenstein while an undergraduate at Cambridge. His academic career was combined with ministry as a college chaplain and then residentiary Canon of the Ely Cathedral; he also served briefly as Curate of St. John's, Newcastle upon Tyne in 1939. Field of research Stead was particularly interested in the application of the Aristotelian concept of substance (ousia) to Christian theology and in the use of the term 'homoousios', initially in a context deemed heretical (in the teaching of Paul of Samosata) by the Council of Antioch (AD 268), subsequently more authoritatively by the Council of Nicaea (AD 325), which in turn gave rise to over half a century of heated discussion. His 1977 book Divine Substance is widely cited among patristic scholars. Stead's interest (taking in en route Marius Victorinus and Gregory of Nyssa) extended to Augustine and John Philoponus' use of the concept. Stead made numerous contributions to better understanding of the teaching of Arius, the Alexandrian theologian in opposition to whose teaching the Council of Nicaea adopted the term 'homoousios'. He also wrote on Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, and Valentinian Gnosticism, as well as on general philosophical issues such as the freedom of the will and concept of mind in the Church Fathers.

Located in the Great Basin, Yucca Mountain is east of the Amargosa Desert, south of the Nevada Test and Training Range and in the Nevada National Security Site. It is the site of the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, which is currently identified by Congressional law as the nation's spent nuclear waste storage facility. However, while licensure of the site through the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is ongoing, political maneuvering led to the site being de-funded in 2010. View to the west from the top of Yucca Mountain Geology Map of the Location of the Mountain The formation that makes up Yucca Mountain was created by several large eruptions from a caldera volcano and is composed of alternating layers of ignimbrite (welded tuff), non-welded tuff, and semi- welded tuff. The volcanic units have been tilted along fault lines, thus forming the current ridge line called Yucca Mountain. In addition to these faults, Yucca Mountain is criss-crossed by fractures, many of which formed when the volcanic units cooled. =Volcanic history= A series of large explosive volcanic eruptions occurred to the north of Yucca Mountain millions of years ago, producing dense clouds of volcanic ash and rock fragments which melted or compressed together to create layers of rock called tuff, forming the mountains and hills of the region. The volcanic eruptions that produced Yucca Mountain ended about 12 million years ago. This explosive volcanism produced almost all (more than 99 percent) of the volcanic material in the Yucca Mountain region. Several million years ago, a different type of eruption began in the area. These eruptions were smaller and much less explosive. These small eruptions were marked by lava and cinders seeping and sputtering from cones or fissures. The last such small eruption occurred about 80,000 years ago. The remaining volcanic material (less than one percent) in the Yucca Mountain region is a result of these smaller eruptions. Yucca Mountain borders a region known as Crater Flat containing several small cones. Cultural history Yucca Mountain and surrounding lands were central in the lives of the Western Shoshone and Southern Paiute peoples, who shared them for religious ceremonies, resource uses, and social events; Yucca Mountain continues to be considered sacred by the Shoshone people living today.

Gruber is the only original remaining member left in the band, following the departure of Teske in July 2008. The other members are Christian K√ºhn (guitar), and Jacob Schmidt (bass guitar). For almost a year the band was looking for a new vocalist, due to Jens Staschel leaving the band shortly before Teske; Staschel's replacement, A.J. Magana from Disgorge, was announced in June 2009. Defeated Sanity has released six studio albums: Prelude to the Tragedy (Grindethic Records, 2004), Psalms of the Moribund (Grindethic, 2007), Chapters of Repugnance (Willowtip Records, 2010), Passages into Deformity (Willowtip, 2013), Disposal of the Dead / Dharmata (Willowtip, 2016), and The Sanguinary Impetus (Willowtip, 2020). Defeated Sanity also released numerous promos, demos, and splits. Influenced by bands such as Cannibal Corpse and Suffocation, their music style is mostly based on American death metal.  History  Defeated Sanity was formed in Dachsbach, Germany in 1994 by guitarist Wolfgang Teske and drummer Lille Gruber, initially as a side project. In 1996, bassist Jonas Gruber and vocalist Robert Colnik joined the band as session musicians. This line-up recorded the first two demos, Devoured by the Black in the same year, followed by Withdrawn from Beauty in 1998. After undergoing a line-up change, Defeated Sanity eventually recruited guitarist Christian M√ºenzner and bassist Tino K√∂hler. Colnik departed the band shortly after recording a demo in 2000. He was replaced by Markus Keller, who re-recorded a track from the demo; the track was included on the split with Poppy Seed Grinder, released through the Czech label Grodhaisn in 2001. Later that year, M√ºnzner left the band to join Necrophagist. Defeated Sanity released a 7-inch split EP with Brazilian death metal band Imperious Malevolence through Merciless Records in 2003. = Prelude to the Tragedy = In 2004, Defeated Sanity signed with UK label Grindethic Records to release their full-length debut. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in Rhauderfehn, Germany. The band produced the record and Andreas Hilbert handled the engineering and mastering. Prelude to the Tragedy was released in November that same year. The album received mixed reviews. Diabolical Conquest said, \\"Prelude to the Tragedy is a gleaming chrome harpoon of immaculate technical death metal, deftly interweaving cryptic riff-tangles with convolutional percussive violence to surprisingly comprehensible and utterly enjoyable results. Drumwork, relentless in its complexity, enhances both the progressive and barbaric elements of the tracks, nailing ambitious patterns to them with satisfying snare punch, lucid cymbals and expert fills.\\" Negative criticism of the album was mostly about the higher technical style of their music. Lords of Metal said, \\"This is only interesting for the real die hard trash (not thrash!) lovers, and mathematicians, of course.\\" To promote the album, the band toured during 2005, appearing at Rotterdam Deathfest (an extreme metal festival in The Netherlands), along with bands such as Suffocation, Visceral Bleeding, and Vomit Remnants. = Psalms of the Moribund and Chapters of Repugnance = Defeated Sanity underwent further line-up changes with Jens Staschel joining on vocals, Christian Kuehn on guitar and Jacob Schmidt filling in on bass. In August 2006, the band recorded their second studio album at Soundlodge Studios. It was produced and engineered by J√∂rg Ukenand, and mastered by Robbert Kok of Disavowed. In the meantime, Gruber played drums for Austrian blackened death metal band Belphegor on their North American tour with Unleashed and Krisiun. Psalms of the Moribund was released through Grindethic Records in March 2007. Like its predecessor, the album received mixed reviews, with Erik Thomas of webzine Teeth of the Divine saying, \\"With ultra deep, almost grindcore styled burps layered over complex yet savage riffs, Defeated Sanity, unlike some of their US peers, do manage to throw in some nice grooves and lurches amid the blasting carnage, hence the Suffocation and Devourment comparisons, but otherwise, Psalms of the Moribund is a pretty breakneck assault of squealing, pinch harmonics and ravenous blast beats.\\" Chronicles of Chaos reviewer Kostas Sarampalis criticized the vocal style of Jens Staschel, stating, \\"The constant low guttural growling is completely unintelligible, used more like a (very blunt) instrument rather than a means to convey lyrics.\\" The band played at Maryland Deathfest at the Sonar in Baltimore, Maryland in May 2008, along with Anaal Nathrakh and Monstrosity. In July 2008, two members left Defeated Sanity: first Staschel, and Teske shortly afterward. Defeated Sanity brought in vocalist A.J. Magana from Disgorge, who recorded the vocals on the band's third full-length album, Chapters of Repugnance, released through Willowtip Records on 4 May 2010. The album was recorded at Soundforge Studios in Berlin. According to Cosmo Lee of Decibel magazine, Chapters of Repugnance is the first album cover on Willowtip that the printer has refused to print. \\"It's a so-bad-it's-good Hieronymus Bosch-esque depiction of hell in which everyone is nude and bald.\\" Beginning in late 2015, Defeated Sanity embarked on a headline U.S. tour, performing their first concert shows in the United States since 2008. = Disposal of the Dead / Dharmata = Before the summer of 2016, Defeated Sanity confirmed work on a new release, which is a two part full- length album with one side titled Disposal of the Dead and the other titled Dharmata. These two parts represent two EPs compiled onto a full-length, with each part carrying a sound unique to it; Disposal of the Dead aimed to represent the more primal side of the band's sound, while Dharmata was a direct homage to the old school progressive death metal style of bands such as Atheist and Cynic. Dharmata prominently features vocals from Max Phelps of Baltimore progressive death metal band Exist, and formerly Cynic as well as Death DTA. In late 2016, the band recruited American vocalist Josh Welshman replacing L√ºhring who departed the following year. Prior to him officially joining, Welshman provided vocals on the band's two US tours, the Obscene Extreme festival as well as other shows in Europe and Indonesia. In 2018, the band participated in the lineup for the American death metal festival Las Vegas Death Fest. = The Sanguinary Impetus = In May 2020, Defeated Sanity announced that their sixth album would be titled The Sanguinary Impetus, and would be slated for a July release. Following the departure of K√ºhn, Gruber performed all guitars on the album in addition to his regular drum duties. Metal Injection called The Sanguinary Impetus \\"freakishly chaotic, frequently unnerving, and stupefyingly complex.\\"  Style and influences  Although the band is of German origin, their music is based on the American style of death metal. Drummer Lille Gruber explained, \\"Blues and rock music was developed in the U.S., that means it all goes back to this country. The roots are there and I think the best musicians will always be there.\\" When asked about the difference in terms of sound and direction between Psalms of the Moribund and Prelude to the Tragedy, Gruber stated, \\"We got our own style on Psalms to the Moribund where Prelude to the Tragedy had very obvious hints of the bands we idolized. Psalms of the Moribund splits in two extremes, it went more chunky, brutal, thick and deep, but at the same time that math-approach and the technicality went up a lot!\\" Defeated Sanity's main influences are the early work of Cannibal Corpse, Immolation, and Suffocation. Gruber also cited newer bands like Disgorge and Devourment as a source of inspiration. Defeated Sanity's lyrics are influenced by the death metal band Brodequin. Gruber described Brodequin‚Äôs lyrics as \\"dark and brutal\\", which fit with Defeated Sanity's gore imagery and said that it‚Äôs an ‚Äúawesome concept‚Äù. On Defeated Sanity's 2016 album Disposal of the Dead / Dharmata, the group perform two separate styles on the two EP-length halves of the album, with the band describing it as \\"a split with ourselves\\". Disposal of the Dead features their signature brutal and technical style while Dharmata is \\"an homage to old school progressive death metal\\" reminiscent of bands such as Death. Jazz influence is prevalent as well.Album Review: DEFEATED SANITY Disposal of the Dead // Dharmata Metal Injection  Members  * Lille Gruber ‚Äì drums (1994‚Äìpresent) * Jacob Schmidt ‚Äì bass (2005‚Äìpresent) * Josh Welshman ‚Äì vocals (2016-present, touring 2015-2016) = Former members = * Konstantin L√ºhring ‚Äì vocals (2011‚Äì2015) * A.J.

It was a revised version of the TC 108G, the body was made by Park Ward who were better able to supply them to the quantity, quality and price required. The cars were slightly taller and a drophead coup√© was added to the range, they were both lighter. The 2993 cc engine was again uprated, now producing mainly by an improved cylinder head and increasing the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1. A new four speed gearbox from the Austin-Healey appeared and Borg Warner three speed automatic transmission was offered. Overdrive was available on the manual transmission from late 1960 to 1962. Suspension was similar to the TC 21, independent at the front using coil springs with leaf springs at the rear but the track was increased by to and a front anti roll bar added. Wire spoked wheels became an option. From 1959 the all drum brake set up was changed to discs at the front retaining drums at the rear.John Price Williams, Alvis: The Post War Cars, Motor Racing Publications, Croydon, 1993 A car with manual transmission was tested by the British magazine The Motor in 1960 and had a top speed of and could accelerate from 0- in 13.5 seconds. A fuel consumption of was recorded. The test car cost ¬£2827 including taxes. Series II In April 1962 the car was upgraded with four wheel Dunlop disc brakes in place of the disc/drum combination and named Series II. Door frames were now constructed of aluminium for lightness as well as being panelled in aluminium to alleviate persistent problems with the Park Ward body's wooden door pillar. The previously stand- alone fog lamps were built into the front of the car, recessed in the middle of new circular air intakes, one for the heater, the other for the carburettors. The rear number plate and the various lamps and reversing lights were re-arranged. In October that year there was a switch to a five speed manual ZF gearbox, the Borg-Warner automatic remained available as an option.
