It was first sailed for in 1921, when it was won by the yacht Heather, which represented the Otago province. The Sanders Memorial Cup is the oldest sailing trophy still competed for in New Zealand. History In early 1921, the Otago Yacht and Motorboat Association challenged its Auckland counterpart to a challenge over a series of races to be conducted in X-class yachts. Walker & Hall, a jewelry firm, donated a 50-guinea cup as a trophy, which was to be named the Sanders Memorial Cup. This was in memory of Lieutenant Commander William Sanders, from Takapuna, who served in the First World War with the Royal Naval Reserve and was a posthumous recipient of the Victoria Cross. The cup stands on an oak plinth and includes three silver panels; these recited tributes to Sanders from King George V, Lord John Jellicoe, the Governor-General of New Zealand, and the Lords of the Admiralty. The inaugural challenge for the Sanders Memorial Cup was won by Heather, sailed by George Wiseman representing Otago, against Iron Duke, representing Auckland and sailed by Jellicoe, in a series of five races on Waitematā Harbour over the Easter period of 1921. For several years, the winners received miniatures of the cup from Walker & Hall although this practice ceased during the Great Depression. However, Wiseman, the skipper of the first yacht to win the cup, did not receive one for the 1921 victory, the miniature instead going to W. McCulloch, the original captain of the Heather who sailed her in the first two races of the series. Notable winners of the Sanders Memorial Cup include Albert Willetts (three times) and Hugh Poole (five times). Since 1971, the cup has been sailed for by Javelin-class yachts.

Life  Giovanni (Johann) Maria Nosseni appeared at the end of January 1575 with a journeyman in Dresden. Nosseni was employed as a painter and sculptor in July 1575. In Weißensee he had come closer to the Lutheran religion by listening to sermons and reading the Bible and changed his faith. In April 1576 he made a journey to Austria. On May 1, 1577 Nosseni married Elisabeth Unruh, the daughter of the former syndic of Liegnitz. He brought his father and his brother Pietro to Torgau. On May 26th 1585 he acquired a house in Dresden. He was supposed to \\"convert it into a common town ornament\\", set up a workshop and warehouse, but was not granted tax exemption. Elisabeth died on 13th February 1591, and his second marriage was on 3rd February 1595 with Christiane Hanisch, the daughter of Mathias Hanisch, the Elector's District Administrator. She also died before him on November 29th, 1606, and he married a third time to the twenty-year-old Anna Maria von Rehnen, the daughter of the Mint Master of the Mint of Dresden, Heinrich von Rehnen. On his tomb, the Nosseni epitaph, of which fragments are found in the Stadtmuseum Dresden, Nosseni and his three wives are depicted.  Works  The Nosseni-Altar of the Sophienkirche in Dresden, designed by Nosseni in 1606/07, since 2002 altar of the Church in Loschwitz In 1579 Nosseni had made two stone tables set with cups, bowls and dishes, two busts of Roman emperors and a chair with polished local stones. From 1580 to 1613 he supplied alabaster and serpentine. In October 1580 Nosseni was suddenly dismissed. He asked to be allowed to collect the finished works from his workshop, but to keep the unfinished ones. During the negotiations that followed, the first ideas for the Freiberg funeral chapel came up. In 1583 he was again in the service of the Elector. On 5th May 1585 he was prescribed 20 years to work in the marble quarry he had discovered near Lengefeld in the Erzgebirge. In 1586 and 1587 he discovered black marble at Grünau, red marble at Wildenfels and white marble at Crottendorf. At the beginning of October 1585 Paul Buchner and Nosseni went to Freiberg to see burials in the choir of the Freiberg Cathedral, \\"as there a princely crypt would like to be furnished\\". They built several models. The Saxon elector Christian I. commissioned Nosseni to complete the funeral chapel. At the beginning of September 1588 Nosseni went to Italy in order to get sculptors, founders and stonemasons for the monumental building at Freiberg. He also visited his parents in Lugano. On October 23rd he arrived in Florence, where he recruited Carlo de Cesare, who later cast the bronze statues in Freiberg. On the way back via Modena he acquired 180 painted and gilded shields (rondelles) for the stable building and in Venice 600 crystal glasses from Murano for the Dresden court. On 31st December he arrived in Dresden. From 1590 onwards, the Belvedere on the Brühlsche Terrasse in Dresden was built according to Nosseni's plans, of which, however, only the lower storey was built until the death of Christian I, and work was stopped here as well. Until its destruction in 1747, the Belvedere was one of the sights of Dresden. Due to this loss, today there is no precise idea of this main work of Nosseni. In 1590 he was granted a privilege for 20 years to mine and use marble, alabaster and Semi- precious stones, which was extended to him for life in 1609. In 1607 Count Ernst von Holstein-Schaumburg began planning his princely mausoleum at Stadthagen and commissioned Nosseni to design it. However, the construction of the building did not begin until the year of Nosseni's death in 1620 and was carried out by his pupil Anton Boten.

Ivy Williams was the first to be called to the bar in 1922. Life Crofts was born in 1889 in Brighton. Her mother, Violet (born Skinner) was descended from a long line of relatives who had been involved with India as a British colony and her family had estates in India. Her father, Thomas Lewis Ingram, was a barrister and she attended Girton College where she gained a Tennis Blue. She graduated in History and Law, but she could not become a lawyer at that time. In 1913 Crofts and three other women started a legal action requesting that the Law Society be compelled to admit women to its examinations. The three other women were Lucy Nettlefold, Karin Costelloe and Gwyneth Bebb. Bebb became the named party for, Bebb v. The Law Society. The case was taken by Stanley Buckmaster KC and R. A. Wright. The test case was heard in the Chancery Division in July 1913 by a hostile judge Mr Justice Joyce. The Solicitors Act 1843 included the sentence, 'every Word importing the Masculine Gender only shall extend and be applied to a Female as well as a Male'. The judge ruled that women had no precedent and therefore he could not authorise the first as that was the role of government. The decision was unsuccessfully contested in the Court of Appeal in December 1913, heard by the Master of the Rolls Lord Cozens-Hardy, Lord Justice Swinfen Eady and Lord Justice Phillimore (included in the law reports in 1914).[1914] 1 Ch. 286 The four would-be lawyers continued to push forward their case using the press. Crofts devoted time to this as well as working in a solicitors office. The British press was mostly in favour and the case helped the campaign for women's admission to the legal profession. The Sex Disqualification (Removal) Act 1919 allowed women to be lawyers. In 1919 the debate in the newspapers included speculation that the cut an thrust of advocates would be restricted because male barristers might go easy on a female opposing barrister. Ingram (then Crofts) was quoted as saying that if women \\"are 'intellectually incapable' it is carrying chivalry rather too far to refuse to permit them to expose themselves as failures.\\" Crofts was the first woman to be articled when she was taken on by Trower, Still and Keeling in 1919. Bebb was expected to be the first British woman lawyer but she died giving birth to her second child in 1921. Crofts became the precedent when she became the first woman to be qualified as a solicitor in England in January 1923. (Ivy Williams had been called to the bar the year before). She had been articled for several years and completed the law society exams the year before as the law had been changed in 1919. Of the four who had contested the legal case only Crofts succeeded in becoming a lawyer. Nettlefold would leave law and go into business, Costelloe became a psychoanalyst and Bedd died. Crofts became a partner in the law firm of Crofts, Ingram and Wyatt & Co. In 1925 the National Council of Women of Great Britain published her book, Women Under English Law. Ingram died at Buckingham House Mansions in London in 1965. Private life She married a solicitor, John Cecil Crofts, in 1922. They had two children and lived in Barham Road in Wimbledon.

The border is 238 km (148 m) in length and runs entirely along the Mekong river from the tripoint with China in the north to the tripoint with Thailand in the south. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with China at the confluence of the Nanla river with the Mekong, and then proceeds in a south-westerly direction down to the tripoint with Thailand at the confluence with the Kok River, save for an eastwards protrusion of the Mekong about halfway along the frontier. History The Mekong has historically served as a natural frontier between various kingdoms and people groups in the region. Its use as the modern boundary between Laos and Myanmar stems from the colonial period in the 19th century. From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and the colony of French Indochina was created in 1887. Laos was then added to the colony in 1893 following the Franco-Siamese War. Meanwhile Britain began occupying Myanmar (then referred to as Burma), gradually incorporating it into British India. On 15 January 1896 Britain and France agreed that the boundary between their two colonies would run along the Mekong. In 1941, following Japan's invasion of Burma, parts of Burma were ceded to Siam as the Saharat Thai Doem territory, thereby ending the existence of the Laos-Myanmar boundary, however these areas were returned to Burma in 1946 following Japan's defeat and the boundary restored.Donald M. Seekins, Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar), p. 251\\"A Forgotten Invasion: Thailand in Shan State, 1941–45\\" In 1937 Burma had been separated from India and became a separate colony, gaining full independence in 1948. Laos obtained a partial independence from France in 1949, gaining complete independence in 1953, with the boundary then becoming one between two sovereign states. The border region became unstable in the subsequent decades, with various armed groups operating here, such as the Chinese Kuomintang, Pathet Lao and various Shan militias. The border is nowadays more peaceful - a joint demarcation survey of the border was conducted in June 1993, and a Friendship Bridge across it was built in 2015.

Dolby, 1854 The Åland War (, ) is a 1854–1856 conflict between the Russian Empire and the allied France and Britain in part of the Crimean War, taking place along the Grand Duchy of Finland in the Gulf of Bothnia and the Gulf of Finland. The war is largely named after the Battle of Bomarsund off the Åland Islands. Although the name of the war largely refers to Åland, battles were also fought in other coastal towns of Finland. The Russian Empire, advancing on the Romanian front, had provoked the Ottoman Empire to declare war on October 4, 1853, and Britain and France decided to support the Ottomans. The purpose of the Åland War was to isolate Russia's service routes and foreign trade and force it into peace, and to involve Sweden in the war against Russia. The blockade was to be carried out in such a way as to render the Russian navy in the Baltic Sea inoperable by destroying the coastal defensive forts, the navy and the trade warehouses which served as foreign trade depots. A significant part of the damage was caused to Finland, as a large part of the merchant fleet flying the Russian flag at that time was in Finland. The war had a major impact on the subsequent demilitarization of Åland. Due to Russia's defeat in the Åland War and the experience of the Crimean War, a spirit of reform began in Russia and it entered into a naval race with Britain and German Empire in the late 19th century. Beginning of the war Admiral Sir Charles Napier (1786–1860) General Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers (1795-1878) Governor-General Platon Rokassowski (1800–1869) The British Navy Division, which consisted of nine steam-powered ships, four older also steam-powered second-line ships, four frigates, and several smaller impeller ships, left Spithead for the Baltic Sea on 11 March 1854 under the command of Vice Admiral Sir Charles Napier. French troops were commanded by General Achille Baraguey d'Hilliers.,Nordisk familjebok (1913), s. 435 (in Swedish) Vice Admiral Alexandre Parseval- Deschenes under his command of the French Navy.Johnsson & Malmberg 2013, s. 125, 131–133, 154, 217–219. (in Finnish) However, the war was not declared to begin until March 27. The British-French naval division of one hundred ships and boats was, by the standards at the time, quite modern with its steam- powered vessels, and it succeeded in forcing the Russian fleet into blockade. The Russian Navy fought defensive only in the vicinity of solid sea forts. The majority of the fleet's activities were directed against the Grand Duchy of Finland. Those who fought in the British-French Baltic Navy were awarded the first Victoria Crosses of all time.Ashcroft (2006), preface. In June, the threat of the British-French navy had already been identified as necessitating the re-establishment of a rebel army similar to Finland's old Swedish rule. Interim Governor-General Platon Rokassowski gave his consent.Theodor Westrin & Ruben Gustafsson Berg: Nordisk familjebok konversationslexikon och realencyklopedi. Nordisk familjeboks förlag, 1916. (in Swedish) At the beginning of the war, the army in the Grand Duchy of Finland consisted only of a Guards Regiment, a naval captain and a crenatorial battalion. Due to the antiquity of its fleet, Russia was not able to resist effectively, but considered its ships as a platform for their cannons as additional protection for war ports such as Viapori (now Suomenlinna) and Kronstadt. There was already a reserve army in Finland in 1855 to supplement the permanent army of nine battalions. The course of the war =Battle in Åland= Violent reconnaissance in the Turku archipelago, a scene from the Åland War, Robert Wilhelm Ekman, 1854 A British-French naval division besieged and captured the unfinished Bomarsund fortress on Åland in the late summer of 1854. The fort was blown up in early September. Because the range of the ship's cannons was longer than that of the coastal cannons, the ships were able to destroy the sea fortress without the latter being able to respond effectively outside the range of their cannons. =Battles in Gulf of Bothnia= Counter Admiral Sir James Hanway Plumridge sailed in the Navy Division, which included HMS Leopard, HMS Valorous, HMS Vulture and HMS Odin, to the Gulf of Bothnia with the task of destroying munitions found in stockpiles. In the Gulf of Bothnia, warfare extended to all coastal towns between 1854 and 1855, with the most significant skirmishes being seen in Rauma, Oulu, Raahe, Tornio and Kokkola. Plumbridgre had authorized HMS Leopard chief George Giffard to guard the closure of the Gulf of Bothnia. The British War Minister, the Duke of Newcastle, had asked to avoid destroying defenseless cities. Giffard's own initiative in the matter did not lead to action against Counter Admiral Plumbridge. The devastation in Raahe caused a debate in the British House of Commons. The Quakers demanded fundraising to compensate for the damage. Kveekarintie (\\"Quakers road\\") in Raahe was built with compensation money.Ja se Oolannin sota - Raahen Museo (in Finnish) From Uusikaupunki to Pori The actions of the enemy, who sailed in the Gulf of Bothnia, extended to Uusikaupunki in June 1855, when the British corvette Harrier entered its waters. The captain of the ship sent a letter to the magistrate warning that the town would be bombed if soldiers came there. Russian troops commanded by Colonel Engelhard were then stationed seven kilometers from Uusikaupunki. At the same time, the British hijacked a Luvian liquor from the port and burned 14 other merchant vessels. On July 6, however, an optical telegraph operating in the town was bombed when the enemy was unable to deliver the fresh meat they demanded. A few residents were killed and small fires broke out near the telegraph station.Auvinen, s. 195–204 (in Finnish) A British warship sailed in front of the port of Rauma on July 2, 1855. Mayor Pettersson negotiated with the British, but refused to hand over the ships they demanded. The enemy then landed with five boats and about a hundred men, starting to occupy the harbor. The British set fire to the warehouse buildings and ships, but had to withdraw after the fire was opened by Russian Cossacks who defended the port and a civilian guard made up of townspeople. According to Swedish newspapers, the English lost seven soldiers in the skirmish crashed and two injured. The British reported six injured, two of whom later died. During the battle, the British managed to set fire to one schooner and two galeases. After the withdrawal of the landing force, a warship anchored in front of the port began firing on the town of Rauma. During the 2,5-hour artillery fire, at least 200 shots were counted, but they did not wreak much havoc.Auvinen, s. 212–219. (in Finnish) The British version of the course of events was different from that of the Rauma people. Commodore A. H. Gardner claimed to have been deceived by Mayor Pettersson because he had imagined that his demands had been granted. Gardner's chief Commodore Warden, on the other hand, stated in a report to Vice Admiral James Dundas that the skirmish that caused the casualties was due to a misunderstanding and a lack of common language among the negotiators. Mayor Pettersson was also outraged by the incident by making his own complaint to Russian War Minister Vasily Dolgorukov, who in turn forwarded it as a French translation to Admiral Dundas and the British Admiralty. The British and French retaliation followed three weeks later on July 24, when two enemy warships anchored in front of the port of Rauma. The next day, ships began firing on the town and at the same time a number of seafarers landed, setting fire to port buildings and timber depots. Rockets and grenades were fired into the urban area until 11 p.m., but they did not wreak havoc either. In the port, on the other hand, a total of 54 buildings and a large amount of timber for shipbuilding were destroyed. The people of Rauma tried to respond to the firing with handguns, but the firing distance was too great and the bullets only hit the sides of the ships. Pori was the target of hostilities for the first time in the late summer of 1854, when an enemy struck the city's outer port on Reposaari and destroyed the mast of an optical telegraph erected there. In addition, property and livestock were taken from local residents. The enemy did not approach the city center for the first time until a year later, on August 9, 1855. The British warship Tartar, led by Commodore Hugh Dunlop, had sailed from Säppi Island to Reposaari two days earlier. There were a small number of Russian soldiers in Pori at the time, as well as a group of about 70 volunteers, but Claes Adam Wahlberg, the Mayor of Pori, decided, after consulting with the local bourgeoisie, to give up the fight. The reason was that almost the whole of Pori had been destroyed by a major fire three years earlier, and there was no desire to endanger the partially rebuilt city.Auvinen, s. 235–244. (in Finnish) The cannons placed on Luotsinmäki were rolled into the river and Mayor Wahlberg set out to negotiate with the enemy who had invaded the city along the Kokemäki River. He reached an agreement according to which Pori will be saved from destruction when the enemy is handed over to the city-owned impeller ship Sovinto and a dozen other ships in the river port, which were sailed for protection just over ten kilometers upstream of the Kokemäenjoki River in Haistila. The activities of the people of Pori were considered shameful and according to some information, Lieutenant General Alexander Jakob von Wendt would have later reduced the officer who had retired from Luotsinmäki to a sergeant in an inspection held at the Pori market square. From Kristinestad to Nykarleby At the beginning of the war, a battalion of soldiers and two artillery batteries were stationed to protect Kristinestad. The military department left the town in the spring of 1855, taking with them the rifles given to a group of civilian volunteers. At the same time, the cannons were also pulled out of their positions and hidden. On June 27, the British paddle steamers Firefly and Driver sailed in front of Kristinestad, destroying empty fire stations and threatening to bomb the town, the port's large timber depot and shipyard. As a result of the negotiations, the bombing was saved, but in return the British had to hand over the schooner Pallas and supply them with food supplies. Firefly re-arrived to pick up tops for its food stores in mid-July, when the French warship D’Assas was also involved. After that, the enemy no longer visited Kristinestad.Auvinen, s. 204–209 (in Finnish) In the first summer of 1854, Vaasa was spared the destruction of the English, perhaps because the fairways leading to the harbors were difficult to navigate and the English knew of the destruction of the city by fire two years earlier. In the autumn of 1855, on August 3, the corvette Firelly anchored in front of the port of Palosaari. An empty house owned by G. G. Wolff, a trade counsellor near the harbor, was burned down as the English had heard that it had housed Russian soldiers. Wolff's ship called Fides was hijacked and another newly completed ship was burned. In addition, the English took over Grönberg's Preciosa as well as the two-prong. The English also decided to replenish their tar storage, and the previously hijacked knunar Necken was towed to port. However, the loading was interrupted as the Russian department sent to the scene arrived to defend the port. The corvette retreated to the end of the artillery range and anchored near Fjällskär. The naval attack on the port of Palosaari took place on 8 August with two artillery barracks, and the events of the attack are part of the legend of Vaasa's civil warfare: The next day, August 9, the English corvette set sail, towing two hijacked vessels. The port itself had suffered only minor damage, and other losses were minor. One Russian and one Finnish soldier fell. The funeral of the Finnish signalman was the next day in Kappelinmäki, where the residents of the city were watching the funeral with military honors. Nykarleby was completely spared the war, even as enemy ships visited the city's outer harbor. The captains of the ships hijacked by the British provided incorrect information about the artillery batteries placed at the mouth of the Lapua River flowing through the city and the number of military units stationed in the locality, which apparently led the enemy not to attack.Auvinen, s. 209–212 From Jakobstad to Tornio The enemy ships had been moving on Jakobstad for the first time already in July 1854, but due to the removed fairway signs they could not reach the port. The next time warships were seen was in July 1854, when Firefly Chief H. C. Otter and Driver Chief Gardner visited the city's inner harbor. They negotiated with Gabriel Tengström, the Mayor of Jakobstad, who managed to convince him that there was no crown property on Jakobstad. In addition, the mayor's defiant behavior led the English to believe that similar resistance could be expected as in Kokkola. Tartar, commanded by Hugh Dunlop, arrived in front of Jakobstad back in November, hijacking one merchant ship and also trying to land on Tukkisaari. However, a Russian artillery battery forced the boats that had planned to land to return to their mother ship. In 13–14 November, Jakobstad was fired for a couple of hours, but the munitions did not wreak havoc.Auvinen, s. 245–253 (in Finnish) HMS Vulture and HMS Odin, led by Frederick Glasse, arrived in front of Kokkola on June 7, 1854, when Glasse demanded the delivery of the ships and material in the port. A patrol was sent ashore from the ships, which was repulsed by the Kokkola people equipped by trade councilor Anders Donner.Facta2001, WSOY 1981, 5. osa, palsta 437 (in Finnish)Facta2001, WSOY 1981, 3. osa, palsta 593 (in Finnish) Before the British came to Vaasa, two Russian companies had come to the rescue.Oiva Turpeinen: Oolannin sota – Itämainen sota Suomessa'. Tammi, 2003. (in Finnish) The British tried to land in Kokkola again the following year. HMS Tartar and HMS Porcupine launched seven landing boats, but the attack was repulsed without material damage after the Davidsberg skirmish. The department destroyed ships and tar stores in Raahe on May 30, 1854 and in Oulu on June 1. In Raahe, the English landed unhindered with six howitzed sloops and eight smaller boats. They burned thirteen ships under construction, a tar court and a pitch bulb under the control of the Oulu Trade Association. In addition, construction timber, sawn timber, salt, logs and e.g. 7,000 barrels of tar. This paid off after the peace, as the tar burned was ordered and paid for by English merchants. The last time the British arrived in Oulu was on June 3, when they demanded that the trees be burned, threatening to burn the entire city. Although all cargo boats were sunk, 12 syllables were transported in tar boats to the English. After June 4, they were divided into two departments going to Tornio and two departments going to Kokkola. The Oulu local government estimates that arson and robbery have caused the city and its citizens damage of REK 380,969 for 98 kopecks. The value of the ships was estimated at 170,925 rubles, the amount of tar of 16,460 barrels at 40,150 rubles, the burnt magazines at 22,950 rubles, the number of shipwrecks at 13,500 rubles and the timber and needs of ships at 11,495 rubles. The greatest damage in Oulu was suffered by G. Bergbom, who lost his property in the amount of 101,106 rubles, to which the loss of the trading room G. & C. Bergbom Ab amounted to 24,600 rubles. A total of 53 people were injured in Oulu, but only nine people suffered more than 10,000 rubles. =Battles in Gulf of Finland= A British illustration of the attack to Suomenlinna, from p. 152 of the 1873 book British Battles on Land and Sea by James Grant. In the Gulf of Finland, the navy department fired on Suomenlinna, then called Viapori, for two days, and the people of Helsinki watched the events from the shore. The Finnish navy crew occupied Santahamina's coastal batteries. The British Navy also fired rockets at Suomenlinna, and this was reportedly the first time these were used in warfare in Finland (one rocket is on display at the War Museum in Helsinki).Sotamuseota nuuskimassa - Sveaborg-Viapori -projekti (in Finnish) Svartholm fortress was fired south of Loviisa.History of War against Russia The Ruotsinsalmi sea fortress, built in Kymi (now Kotka) and left without defenders, was almost completely destroyed in the war.www.kotka.fi - linnoitushistoria (in Finnish) Ending of the war For the third summer, the British planned to assemble a larger fleet in the Baltic Sea, with more than 250 ships, but the Crimean War ended before there was time to do so. As a result of the end of the Crimean War, the Åland War resulted in the British detonating the Bomarsund Fortress, which had first been offered to Sweden as a thank you for remaining neutral in fear of Russia's future reactions. For the British and French, the Bomarsund Fortress was a symbol of Russian expansionism affecting the security of the Swedish capital, Stockholm, during the Crimean War. Offering the fortress to Sweden and then destroying it was evidence of its ability to buffer Russia's supposed enlargement efforts. The British demanded in the Paris Peace Treaty of 1856 that Russia keep Åland unfortified and neutralized. The demilitarization of Åland continued even after the First World War, when Åland was finally confirmed to belong to Finland by a decision of the League of Nations on the basis of historical documents. The reason was that it was also ruled during the Swedish rule through the Grand Duchy of Finland, which includes eight Swedish provinces, from Turku, not Stockholm. In return for Finland's strengthening of the region, Finland had to guarantee Ålanders extensive self-government and cultural rights. Demilitarization continued even after that. The fortification of Åland came to the fore in later negotiations in 1938–1939, in which the Soviet Union sought to protect its own Baltic Sea areas from possible German attacks. Even after the Second World War, Åland remained a demilitarized region. The experience of the Crimean War in Russia began with a spirit of reform, which during Czar Alexander II gave rise to major social reforms to modernize and industrialize Russia. Militarily politically, in the late 19th century, Russia embarked on a naval race with Britain and Germany. In the defeat of Tsushima's naval battle fought between Russia and Japan during the Russo-Japanese War, Russia lost a significant portion of the Baltic Sea fleet exported to the Pacific Ocean for reinforcement. In order to save the time needed to build a replacement fleet, Russia had to focus on developing a strong coastal artillery in accordance with the principle of the Peter the Great's Naval Fortress. The Oolannin sota song On the basis of the Åland War, the Finnish song \\"Oolannin sota\\" was born in the 1850s, the lyricist or composer of which is unknown. The “fästninki” mentioned in the words of the song means the fortress of Bomarsund in Sund, Åland.National Anthems & Patriotic Songs - Oolannin sota lyrics + English translation The song is very popular, but its origin was unknown for a long time, until researchers Jerker Örjans and Pirjo-Liisa Niinimäki found out in the 21st century. The original version of the song “Åland War Song” was found in a handwritten songbook in the municipality of Renko in the 1850s. The original words are apparently forged by English unknown Bomarsund soldiers who remained prisoners of war in England, as they tell of a prisoner of war in Lewes, England. Örjans and Niinimäki speculate that the lyricist may have been Johan Wallenius from Tavastia, who worked as a shuttle in Bomarsund. The original wording depicted a rather realistically defeated struggle and was apparently transformed into its now known form in the early 20th century, which does not mention Bomarsund's surrender. The current lyrics are known to first appear in a songbook published in 1911. The original language of the song is obviously Finnish, as the earliest known Swedish version dates back to 1925. In Åland itself, the song is still completely unknown today.syntyi engelsmannin vankeudessa Turun Sanomat 15.2.2004.

A former emergency medical technician, he was sentenced to death, and is currently trying to appeal said sentence.  Case overview  In the months of November and December, 2014, three residents of the \\"S Amille Kawasaki Yukimachi\\" nursing home died suddenly. The deaths were ruled as suspicious, and possibly homicidal in nature. On February 16, 2016, the Kanagawa Prefectural Police arrested 23-year-old Hayato Imai, a former employee, on murder charges. In May 2015, he had been fired for stealing a patient's wallet and sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, but had allowed to leave prison under a 4-year-long suspended sentence.  Timeline  * 2014 ** May 5: Imai began working at the nursing home. ** November 4: an 87-year-old male patient was found dead in the backyard. ** December 9: an 86-year-old female patient was found dead in the backyard. ** December 31: a 96-year-old female patient was found dead in the backyard. * 2015 ** May 21: Imai was arrested on suspicion of stealing a patient's wallet. ** September 24: Hayato is found guilty, sentenced to two years and six months imprisonment, with a 4-year suspended sentence. ** Late September: An investigation into the deaths is launched. Imai told the Mainichi Shimbun and other newspapers that he was not involved: \\"I chose the long-term care industry because I wanted to see them off, as my own family had died\\". ** December 11: Three other ex-employees were arrested on charges of battery against a patient. The charges against one stuck, but the others were released for unknown reasons. ** December 21: The Kawasaki District Court suspends nursing fees to the facility for three months. * 2016 ** Late January: Imai is interviewed on several occasions by the Kanagawa Prefectural Police. ** February 15: The Kanagawa Prefectural Police arrest Imai, after he made statements incriminating himself. During his interviews, Hayato shared information only the killer would know. ** February 16: Imai is arrested on suspicion of committing for the first murder. ** March 4: Imai is arrested on suspicion of committing the second murder. On the same day, the Yokohama District Public Prosecutor's Office announces that it will take up the case. ** March 5: An investigation by the Kanagawa Prefectural Police reveals that a pipe was found on the second victim's private balcony, near she had fallen to her death. ** March 25: Imai is arrested on suspicion of killing the third victim. That same day, he is officially charged with the second murder by the Yokohama District Prosecutor's Office. ** April 15: Imai is officially charged with the third murder, thus ending the investigation.  Trial  On November 6, 2017, the Yokohama District Court, with presiding Justice Watanabe Eikei, decides that the date of the first trial would be January 23, 2018. Immediately after his arrest, Imai confessed to the three murders, but in subsequent interviews before the trials, he changed his testimony, at first claiming to be unable to remember the events. Later on, he said that he remembered, but professed his innocence. The attorneys claimed his confession would be unreliable, and its credibility would be the biggest issue of the whole trial. = First trial, Yokohama District Court = On January 23, 2018, the trial began in the Yokohama District Court, with Justice Hidetaka Watanabe at the head of it. In the prosecution's opening statement, it was said that, at the time of the murders, the defendant was the only one on duty, and that it was extremely unlikely that anybody else could've been the perpetrator. Regarding his confession, the prosecutors noted that it was recorded, and deemed credible, insisting that this was serial murder against weak, elderly people who trusted the staff. On the contrary, Hayato denied the claims, saying that he had no memory of being at the facility at the designated time frame. In addition, the defense counsel argued that he should be acquitted, stating that Imai showed signs of amnesia, and thus shouldn't be considered criminally liable for the deaths. In total, 23 witnesses would be questioned, including doctors and other officials working at the nursing home, in addition to various evidence being presented.  Closing arguments  On March 1, 2018, the closing arguments were presented, with the prosecution demanding the death penalty for Imai. The defense counsel opposed these demands, reiterating about their client's innocence. According to them, there was no feasible evidence demonstrating that Hayato was responsible for the deaths, and it couldn't be ruled out that they were accidents or suicides. When it came to the confession, they alleged that it was coerced by law enforcement. In his final statement, Imai said the following: \\"I wanted to be released from the interrogation, but I was forced to make a false confession, speaking the truth only in court. I haven't done anything.\\"  Sentence  On March 22, 2018, Justice Watanabe Eikei found the defendant guilty of the murders, and sentenced Hayato Imai to death. In the court ruling, it was deemed that the suspect's confession was very unlikely to have been forced, and was deemed credible. Imai's defense team appealed the verdict, sending it to the Tokyo High Court. No decision has been returned yet.  Motivation  Regarding Imai's possible motive, he himself claimed to have experienced \\"mixed emotions\\" and that he was a \\"troubled man\\" when questioned about the first murder. In addition, the Kanagawa Prefectural Police believe that another possibility could be the stressful nature of his profession, backed up by remarks made by Hayato himself.  Hayato Imai's life  According to his acquaintances, Imai was a \\"friendly guy\\", but was often prone to bragging. He was a qualified paramedic, and regarded highly by everybody around him. However, at the time of the murders, numerous thefts were reported at the facility, leading to suspicions that it might've been his doing. In addition, he is known as a compulsive liar. Some have speculated that he could be responsible for other deaths at the nursing home, and could possibly be behind his sister's death as well.Killed 3 or more people!?

Description The rigid and prickly shrub often has a roughly rounded habit and grows to a maximum height about and a width of . Like most species of Acacia it has phyllodes rather than true leaves. The phyllodes are attached directly by the base to the branchlet are rigid, straight or slightly recurved. The compressed phyllodes have a length of around and a width of with six distinct veins, one of each margin and two on each face. The veins quite raised from the surface with well-defined ridges. It blooms between July and September producing simple inflorescences with spherical golden-yellow flower-heads. Taxonomy The species was first formally described by the botanists Richard Sumner Cowan and P.J.Lang in 1990 as part of the work Plant Portraits as published in the Journal of the Adelaide Botanic Gardens. It was reclassified as Racosperma hexaneurum by Leslie Pedley in 2003 then transferred back to genus Acacia in 2006. The specific epithet is derived from the Greek words hex meaning six and neura meaning nerves in reference to the six nerves running along the length of the phyllodes. Distribution The shrub has a limited distribution in the north eastern part of the Eyre Peninsula of South Australia from around Kimba and Cowell where it is usually situated on small quartzite hills often combined with limestone or ironstone bedrock and growing in gravelly loams and sandy soils that are well drained.

The border is 2,416 km (1,501 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with Laos in the north to Andaman Sea coast in the south. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Laos at the confluence of the Kok and Mekong Rivers and, after briefly following the Kok and then the Sai, then proceeds overland to the west via a series of irregular lines through the Daen Lao Range, before turning to the south-west and joining the Salween River. The border follows the Salween and then Moei River southwards, before leaving it and proceeding southwards overland through the Dawna Range and Bilauktaung Range (collectively these mountains form the Tenasserim Hills). The border continues southwards down the Malay Peninsula, almost cutting Thailand in two at Prachuap Khiri Khan, before reaching the Isthmus of Kra and the Kraburi River, which it then follows out via a wide estuary to the Andaman Sea. The maritime boundary then follows coordinates marked by the countries' continental shelf delimitation agreement towards the tripoint with India, which controls the Andaman and Nicobar Islands. History Map of the areas briefly annexed to Thailand during the Second World War The border regions have historically been contested between the various Thai and Burmese states. Fighting between Burma and the Siamese Ayutthaya Kingdom over control of what is now Myanmar's Tanintharyi Region dominated the area in the 16th century, before Burma destroyed Ayutthaya and took control of the region in 1767. Soon after, Siam extended suzerainty over the Lanna Kingdom (now Northern Thailand), which had previously been under Burmese control. Burmese expansion in the 19th century brought it into conflict with the British in India, sparking a series of conflicts which ended with Burma being occupied and incorporated into British India. With France occupying French Indochina in the same period, the two European states allowed the Kingdom of Siam (the old name for Thailand) to retains its independence as a buffer state. In 1868 Britain and Siam signed a treaty delimiting the Burma- Thai border from the Salween south to the Andaman Sea. Following some confusion as to the border's location, on the ground demarcation of the border commenced from 1889–92. In 1892 the northern section of the border delimited and then demarcated on the ground from 1893–94, with a final boundary treaty with maps signed on 17 October 1894. The northern terminus of the border was fixed in 1896 when the British and French agreed that the Mekong would serve as the Burma-Laos border. Some minor boundary adjustments occurred in 1929 and 1934. In 1941, following Japan's invasion of Burma, parts of Burma were ceded to Siam as the Saharat Thai Doem territory, however these areas were returned to Burma in 1946 following Japan's defeat and since then the border has remained in place.Donald M. Seekins, Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar), p. 251\\"A Forgotten Invasion: Thailand in Shan State, 1941–45\\" In 1937 Burma was separated from India and became a separate colony, gaining full independence in 1948, at which point the border became an international frontier between two sovereign states. At present there is an outstanding dispute over the ownership of some small islands in the Andaman Sea. From 2010-12 there were clashes along the border between the Myanmar army and the Karen National Liberation Army.

It is situated along Manila Bay and is made from crushed dolomite rocks. History Government officials inspect progress of the beach project. Partial progress on the artificial beach project. The Manila Bay Beach is a project of the Philippine national government. It is part of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources's (DENR) Manila Bay Rehabilitation Program launched by Secretary Roy Cimatu in January 2019. Within the same year, part of the 2020 national project was allocated for the artificial beach project. The project has received support from the Manila city government led by Mayor Isko Moreno. Work on the artificial beach began as early as August 2020, when the government issued a permit to Philippine Mining Service Corporation to transport crushed dolomite from Alcoy, Cebu to Manila. When the Manila Bay Beach project came to wider public attention in 2020, the project has received criticism from environment and heritage conservationist groups. Among these include the timing of the project which was implemented amidst the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns of adverse environmental effects caused by dumping dolomite on the polluted Manila Bay. As of September 25, environment chief suspends dolomite mining operation Cebu as a source of Manila Bay white sand. The Manila Bay Beach was first opened to the public from September 19 to 20, 2020. It was closed again for expansion. Beach Manila Bay beach during its temporary opening. The Manila Bay Beach is an artificial beach adjacent to the United States Embassy chancery complex. It was made by dumping crushed dolomite on top of naturally-occurring grey sand. At least 3,500 of dolomite sourced from a mine in the town Alcoy in Cebu ran by the Dolomite Mining Corporation. The initial phase of the beach project cost including the purchase and transport of dolomite. The planned total length of beach will cover the whole stretch of Roxas Boulevard. The beach if completed, will have the breakwater of the Manila Yacht Club at its southernmost tip. Impact =Health= The Department of Health (DOH) cautioned that the inhalation of dolomite dust can cause respiratory issues. However, after the health department learned from the DENR that dolomite used for the artificial beach is two to five millimeters or 100 times bigger than dust, it released an advisory that dolomite used in the Manila Bay Beach won't pose health hazard since it won't get suspended in the air. =Environmental effect= The DENR has maintained that the dolomite used to create the Manila Bay Beach poses no harm to the Manila Bay's ecosystem. The dumping of dolomite has been suspected as a possible cause for a fish kill on September 17, 2020 near the waters of the Baseco Compound. The DENR countered the claim, saying that the fish kill happened away from the artificial beach, pointed out that the southwest monsoon is prevailing at that time and the presence of a breakwater between the site and adjacent waters of the beach. Cebu's Provincial Environment and Natural Resources Office (PENRO) conducted a survey on coral reefs in Alcoy, Cebu. Its study concluded that corals in the area sustained damage due heavy siltation caused by the mining of dolomite used for the Manila Bay project.

Family  Born in Oschersleben, Forstreuter was the daughter of the engineer Hermann Forstreuter and his wife Anna Elise, née Reinhardt. On her father's side, she was descended from Salzburg Protestants. She received her education together with Ella von Klitzing, who was the same age, on the von Klitzing family's Neudorf estate, as the two mothers were friends.

At the same time, she edited the \\"Frauen-Beilage\\", belonging to the same publishing group '. In her spare time, she wrote poetry and novellas. Until 1945, she frequently visited the family of her foster sister, who had meanwhile married Friedrich von Arnim, at Schloss . She wrote there many of her works. The narrow poetry collections were published in small editions. Forstreuter reached a wider audience by publishing poems in partly renowned journals (for example Die Bergstadt, Die Dame, Die Woche, Jugend, Der Türmer, Westermanns Monatshefte). Her works were positively received by the literature critics. She wrote the verses of the unprinted picture book Bunte Waldgeschichten and Bärchens Abenteuer created around 1940 by the Magdeburg painter and graphic artist, .

As Managing Director of Colnaghi he would bid on behalf of Neil MacGregor for the National Gallery, (a role Colnaghi had performed since the nineteenth century), as well as for other institutions. In addition to acting as agent for museums, Knight was involved in the rediscovery of many lost masterpieces; his discovery of a long-lost double portrait by Sir Anthony van Dyck opens the narrative of Philip Mould's book Sleepers.Philip Mould, \\"Sleepers: In Search of Lost Old Masters\\", London: Fourth Estate, 1995, ., retitled in paperback as \\"The Trail of Lot 163: In Search of Lost Art Treasures\\", London: Fourth Estate, 1997, .

Knight recruited up-and-coming young art historians to curate and catalogue his shows, which often included museum loans alongside works for sale, and published catalogues with scholarly apparatus. He was an early supporter of , Colin Bailey (who would go on to become director of The Frick Collection, the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco and the Morgan Library & Museum) and Watteau expert Alan Wintermute. In 1995, Knight organised one of the first exhibitions of Russian contemporary art to be held in the West since the fall of the Soviet Union. Under Richard Knight Colnaghi was also known for its increased activity in New York, which included an important exhibition marking the bicentennial of the French Revolution in 1989, one of a series of New York shows leading up to Colnaghi in America: A survey to commemorate the first decade of Colnaghi, New York (1992). In 1996 he formed Hall and Knight, which continued this reputation for respectable exhibitions, including the first ever one-man show of George Stubbs (2000) and Procaccini in America (2002), the catalogues of which are still cited as essential monographs in the bibliography for each respective artist. Hall and Knight was acquired by Christie's in 2004, where Knight became Co-Head of the International Old Masters Group. While at Christie's, Knight presided over the final dispersal of the Cook, Philips and Johnson collections, the sale of Poussin's Ordination from the Duke of Rutland's Belvoir Castle, the sale of paintings belonging to the Prince of Liechtenstein and the sale of paintings by Rubens (Portrait of a Commander) and Guercino (King David) from Princess Diana's childhood home, Althorp, the latter of which was later returned to its original eighteenth-century location, Spencer House, after a loan to the National Gallery.

It was based on a British play that had been filmed by the ABC in 1957. It was the second live drama recorded at the ABC in Brisbane, after Vacancy in Vaughan Street. It was shot at the ABC's studios in Toowong. Australian drama was very rare at the time, and mostly made in Sydney and Melbourne. Plot In 1880, Jenny Brown worries about the trips her tobacconist husband Arthur is making to Eastborne to visit his ailing aunt. There are also a series of unsolved murders. The aunt, Mrs Persephelous, visits Jenny.

They had to recreate the parlour at the back of Arthur's shop and decided to add the shop as well to give the set better dimensions and to open out the play from its stage origins. The tobacco used was made of peat moss. The production was taped at the ABC studios in Toowong and that recording was broadcast. During the broadcast and cast re-enacted the play in the studio; they did this without the costumes or sets used during the taping, but just to improve. \\"We are still inexperienced and we have to make every effort to improve,\\" said Cubbage. Ray Menmuir, ABC director, was in Brisbane on December 3 and 4 to watch the taping and offer suggestions.

It was produced by Bob Cubbage who said \\"we chose a simple play to use as an exercise. We wanted to learn as much as we could from it.\\" Bob Cubbage, ABC Supervisor of Drama and Features in Queensland, said they selected the play because it \\"has a simple plot and was chosen as a TV exercise for local actors and producers...

Cubbage produced the play to rehearsal stage then director Wilf Buckler took over. Don McTaggart was a Brisbane actor who mostly worked in radio. He had appeared in A Sleep of Prisoners. Judith Stephenson and Betty Ross were experienced Brisbane stage actors. Reception The Sydney Morning Herald called it \\"pleasantly amusing at best but also containing inconsistencies and some feeble touches.\\" TV Week called it \\"a worthy effort and a triumph for all concerned\\" saying McTaggart \\"walked off with the acting honors but his supporting cast was a fine one... It makes you wonder why we have had to wait almost four eyars for this type of programme to emanate from our local studio.

Based on Wharton's own experiences, it was published in 1982 following Birdy (1978) and Dad (1981). The novels deals with six American soldiers who get a mission to have an eye on a German outpost at the heart of the Ardennes Forest, but the mission turns out to be much more difficult than expected. Wharton notes that he wrote this novel \\"thinking of the massacre of My Lai in Vietnam, to show how easy it was for a massacre to take place. And he did know how easy\\". Plot The novel is set during the last days of WWII in the Ardennes Forest, and follows a group of six American soldiers, led by sergeant William Knot, called Won't by his comrades. Weary of this futile war, they are ordered to establish an observation post in an old chateau in order to have an eye on a German outpost. A few days after their arrival, they begin hearing strange noises and noticing Germans leaving strange signs of their presence. After some difficult communication with the Germans, they realize that the \\"Krauts\\" wish to surrender to avoid being sent to Russia. Everything seems perfectly ready for a fake surrender scene to finish the deal. But war is never so simple. Reception Though not as popular as Wharton's earlier novels, A Midnight Clear was generally well-received by critics. For instance, Thomas R. Edwards of the New York Times calls the novel \\"a modest inquiry into war, youth and extinction ... [which is] also remarkable\\". Sherwood Williams of The Christian Science Monitor calls it a \\"WWII saga of remarkable power\\" noting that \\"Wharton reveals the ugliness of war far better by reminding us of the joy of life than by pedantically documenting the brutality of battle\\". Film adaptation In 1992, the novel was adapted into a popular movie of the same name, starring an ensemble cast that features Ethan Hawke and Gary Sinise, among others. The movie received generally positive reviews. It currently holds an 88% favorable rating on Rotten Tomatoes which is based on 40 reviews. One of its unique features is how it shows the relation with enemy soldiers: \\"One of the most impactful aspects of A Midnight Clear is that when the time comes to kill, the targets are no longer faceless\\". The Washington Post praises the movie as \\"a war film completely unlike any other, a compelling accomplishment that's more soul than blood and bullets\\".

The episode was directed by Ridley Scott and written by Aaron Guzikowski. Plot Two androids, Mother (Amanda Collin) and Father (Abubakar Salim), escape a war- ravaged Earth, taking with them twelve human embryos. Their spacecraft crash- lands into a hole in the planet Kepler-22b. After setting up camp in the desert, Mother hooks herself up to artificial umbilical cords to allow six fetuses to grow. Nine months later, the children are born, the youngest of whom initially appears stillborn; Mother and Father name him Campion, after their creator. One of their daughters, Tally, is presumed dead after falling into a hole, while three other children die of illness. Four years later, only Mother, Father, Campion (Winta McGrath), and his sister, Spiria (Bronte Carmichael), remain. Mother begins teaching her children about atheism and a religious order on Earth known as the Mithraic; having been programmed by atheists, she emphasizes that their new colony on Kepler-22b must be rooted in science, rather than \\"fantasy\\". Spiria dies soon after. Concerned about the fate of Campion as the sole surviving human, Father attempts to communicate with the Mithraic, whose spacecraft (an ark dubbed Heaven) has arrived at Kepler-22b and is orbiting the planet. Outraged to learn of this, a malfunctioning Mother attacks and disables Father and hides his body. Campion succeeds in contacting the ark and a small Mithraic reconnaissance team discovers their plantation. Considering Campion to be a possible prophet, the Mithraics decide to abduct him and destroy Mother. However, their plan backfires, and Mother kills several members of the team. One of the team, Marcus, (Travis Fimmel) attempts to escape in the reconnaissance ship but is stopped by Mother and thrown out. Mother hijacks the ship and boards the ark. The Mithraics attempt to repel her but she disintegrates her attackers with sonic screams. After setting the ark on a crash course with the planet, Mother returns to the farm with a number of children from the ark. Marcus is shown to have survived Mother's assault, and Campion begins to have reservations about Mother. Production \\"Raised by Wolves\\" was directed by Ridley Scott, who also directed the show's second episode, \\"Pentagram\\". The screenplay was written by Aaron Guzikowski. Filming took place in South Africa. Release \\"Raised by Wolves\\" premiered on September 3, 2020 on the subscription video on demand streaming service HBO Max.

The patron of the relief is unknown. However, the oeuvre's stucco copy came into the possession of Cardinal Bernardino Spada (1594 – 1661)Miranda - Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church: Bernardino Spada early on. The original marble relief is currently housed at the Galleria Doria Pamphilj in Rome. A stucco copy is housed at the Galleria Spada in Rome. Relief Gian Pietro Bellori described this oeuvre thusly: > [Duquesnoy] figurò l'Amor divino che abbatte l'Amor profano calcandolo [sic] > col piede, e chiudendogli la bocca con la mano, per farlo tacere, mentre > un'altro [sic] fanciullo inalza [sic] la corona di lauro in premio della > vittoria immortale According to Bellori, Duquesnoy pushed for the commission of such a relief after becoming fascinated with the subject of the putti. This, according to Bellori, happened after Duquesnoy observed Titian's putti (incidentally, Titian also produced a painting with the same title as Duquesnoy's relief, Sacred and Profane Love). Duquesnoy would later revise and markedly improve his putti, becoming the greatest master in the representation of the winged infants and setting an example for other sculptors to follow with the putti of the Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde. According to Lingo, there is a poem (\\"The Battle of Sacred and Profane Love\\") in Pope Urban VIII's Poëmata that is associable with Duquesnoy's opus. In that poem, \\"Urban envisioned his conflicting spiritual and worldly desires as twin loves in vigorous combat.\\" In the relief, the Sacred Love's putto smacks down the Profane Love's putto by kicking him and shutting his mouth with his hand, \\"so as to silence him.\\" Another putto raises a laurel wreath in sign of everlasting victory. The relief is remarkable for the careful treatment of the surfaces and its \\"subtly graduated layers.\\" References Further reading * External links * Victory of Sacred Love over Profane Love at Web Gallery of Art Category:1620s sculptures Category:1630s sculptures Category:Sculptures in Rome Category:Sculptures by François Duquesnoy Category:Sculptures in Italy Category:Marble sculptures Category:Marble reliefs Category:Reliefs in Italy Category:Galleria Spada ","title":"Victory of Sacred Love over Profane Love"},{"id":"65362526","text":"Arthur Henry Purcell Durston (1889–1938) was an American artist of British descent.

Bhattacharjee had done her schooling at St. Margaret School. She stood first in her bachelor's degree with Sanskrit and became qualified for scholarship of Ishan at Calcutta University, but due to her being Christian she was deemed ineligible as per the endowment policy of the scholarship.

From 1935 until 1938 he lived in London for his university education. With the dismemberment of Czechoslovakia in 1938, his parents decided to send Andrew abroad. He passed the doctoral exams for Yale University in 1941 and joined the United States Army, where he served as an intelligence specialist in North Africa and Italy.

Early life  Ivan Fedulov/Gronsky was born into a peasant family in the Lyubimsky district of Yaroslavl province, in Russia. His father died when he was young, and at the age of 12 he was sent to St Petersburg where he worked as a cook, loader, and locksmith. As a teenager he joined the Union of Socialists- Revolutionaries Maximalists. He had a few pieces published in radical newspapers, for which he was invited by Maxim Gorky to his home, when he met some of Russia's leading cultural figures. He served in the Russian army during World War I, and awarded the St George for bravery. After the Bolshevik Revolution in October 1917 (old style), Gronsky was elected to represent soldiers from his infantry division on the Dvina front. He joined the Communist Party in 1918. In 1921, he was enrolled in the Institute of Red Professors, to study economics. In 1924, he was selected for an internship to study in the U.K. under John Maynard Keynes, but was assigned to party work in Kolomna instead. In 1925, Gronsky joined the staff of Izvestia, and was appointed Editor after the death of Ivan Skvortsov-Stepanov in 1928. He was credited with helping to rescue the career of the popular writer Boris Pilnyak, who was the target of a campaign by the Russian Association of Proletarian Writers (RAPP). In 1930 Gronsky persuaded Pilnyak to write the novel The Volga Flows to the Caspian Sea, celebrating the drive to industrialise Russia, which rehabilitated him in the eyes of the communist leadership.  'Socialist Realism' and the Writers' Union  In April 1932, Gronsky was appointed a member of a five-man commission to review the situation in the soviet arts, in the wake of the disbanding of RAPP. Shortly before the commission met, he was summoned to a private session with Joseph Stalin, in which they discussed literary politics, and came up with the term Socialist Realism to define what was to be the official style of soviet literature for the remainder of the 1930s. Gronsky later defined Socialist Realism as \\"Rembrant, Rubens and Repin put at the service of the working class\\". In May 1932, he was appointed Chairman of the Organising Committee of the USSR Writers Union, with Maxim Gorky as Honorary Chairman. As Gorky was being lured back to live permanently in Russia, and take on the chairmanship of the Writers Union, Gronsky was at a meeting in which Stalin proposed to rename Nizhny Novgorod, Tverskaya Street in Moscow, and the Moscow Art Theatre in Gorky's honour, Gronsky claimed later that he objected that the MAT was more associated with Anton Chekhov than Gorky, but was overruled. In 1932-37, Gronsky was chief editor of the literary magazine Novy Mir, and instigated the practice of printing a portrait of Stalin and a poem to his glory in almost every issue of the magazine. The poet Boris Pasternak thought he was \\"stupid\\", telling the visiting French writer André Gide that Gronsky had , and that he talked in political cliches - \\"but it is impossible to blame him for that\\". Gronsky's wife's sister was married to the poet, Pavel Vasiliev, from whom he learnt that one of Russia's most talented living poets, Nikolai Klyuev was an active homosexual. Gronsky immediately denounced Klyuev, who was arrested on 2 February 1934, and later shot.  Role in the Purges  On 1 September 1936, after the conclusion of the first of the Moscow Show Trials, Gronsky summoned a meeting of Novy mir's staff and contributors, telling them the magazine had been infiltrated by the alleged 'Trotskyite-Zinovievite conspiracy', and criticised himself and others, including Pilnyak, in what was an evident attempt to save himself and the magazine. This failed. He was sacked from the editorship in April 1937 for his alleged lack of 'Bolshevik vigilance' - ie for having published work by Pilnyak, Galina Serebryakova and others now under arrest, and by Boris Pasternak, who was under suspicion. Years after the event, it was reported that Gronsky courageously rang Stalin to protest when Marshal Tukhachevsky was arrested in May 1937, but was abruptly told by the dictator to mind his own business - despite which, he even more courageously tried to intervene on behalf of Marshal Blyukher. The first story seems unlikely, because Marshal Tukhachevsky's arrest came a month after Gronsky had been sacked. The second is certainly untrue, because when Blyukher was arrested in October 1938, Gronsky was already in custody.  Arrest and Exile  Gronsky was summoned to NKVD headquarters on 30 June 1938, and went voluntarily, not expecting to be arrested. He was held in solitary confinement and accused of creating a conspiratorial 'centre' in 1932 with Aleksei Stetsky. He was held for 11 months, tortured, and then sentenced to 15 years in the gulag. He was deported to Kotlas in Arkhangelsk province, and then to Vorkuta, where he was compelled to do hard labour, including coal mining. In April 1953, he was exiled to Karaganda. He was released from exile and allowed to return to Moscow when his case was reviewed in Februaryt 1954. The case was officially closed on the 16th anniversary of his arrest. In retirement, he wrote extensively, and retained his belief in the communist system.

Her death received immediate and significant public attention; a vigil at the Supreme Court plaza in Washington, D.C., was held that same evening. Memorials and vigils were held in several U.S. cities, including Chicago, New York City, San Francisco and Sedona. Ginsburg became the first woman to lie in repose at the Supreme Court Building on September 23 and, the following day, became the first justice to lie in repose for a second day. On September 25, she lay in state at the Capitol, becoming the first woman and first Jewish person to do so. A private interment service was held at Arlington National Cemetery.  Health and death  Ginsburg had previously been diagnosed with colon cancer, which was in remission by 1999, and early-stage pancreatic cancer in 2009. In 2014, she had surgery to implant a stent. Tumors in her lungs were detected in December 2018 while she was being treated for broken ribs from a fall. Ginsburg died from complications of metastatic pancreatic cancer on September 18, 2020, at age 87. Days before her death, she dictated a statement to her granddaughter Clara Spera, an attorney, which reads in part: \\"My most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\\"  Vigils  A candlelit makeshift memorial to Ginsburg on the day she died Hundreds of people began gathering in front of the Supreme Court in Washington, D.C., within hours of the news of Ginsburg's death. The Mourners Kaddish was recited by mourners, along with songs such as \\"Amazing Grace\\" and \\"America the Beautiful\\", and a liberal Jewish commentator referred to her as a tzadeikes, or a person of great righteousness. Additional gatherings were held in cities across the United States. Online memorials were created on different social media platforms. By the next morning, a makeshift memorial had been created on the steps of the court. On September 19, the tributes at the Supreme Court were removed and a barricade erected before the building. About 2,500 people attended a vigil that evening. Among the several speakers at the rally were Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D–New York) and Elizabeth Warren (D–Massachusetts). Warren drew cheers from the crowd as she criticized the Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Many speakers made references to abortion access, of which Ginsburg was a proponent; Jasmine Clemons of Planned Parenthood said \\"I made the best decision for my life, my future and my body. That was made possible because of women like Justice Ginsburg. Vigils were also held in cities across the United States. Some gatherings were promoted by organizers of the Women's March who urged people to gather at their local courthouses. Hundreds of people attended vigils in Chicago, Kingston, New York, Portland, Maine, Minneapolis and San Francisco. An image of Ginsburg as well as messages reading \\"thank you\\" and \\"rest in power\\" were projected on the New York State Civil Supreme Court building in New York City. White jabots (or collars) , similar to the ones worn by Ginsburg, were placed on several statues in New York City, most notably on the Fearless Girl sculpture outside the New York Stock Exchange.  Memorials and tributes  As has been tradition since as early as 1873 and the death of Chief Justice Salmon P. Chase, the courtroom doors of the Supreme Court, Ginsburg's seat, and the bench before her seat were each draped in black. On September 18, Speaker Nancy Pelosi of the House of Representatives ordered flags at the U.S. Capitol to be flown at half-staff in honor of Ginsburg. On September 19, President Donald Trump also ordered all U.S. flags at federal buildings to be flown at half-staff until Ginsburg's burial. Shortly after Ginsburg's death, multiple statues and renaming of locations were proposed in her honor. Bill de Blasio, Mayor of New York City, announced that the Brooklyn Municipal Building in New York City would be renamed in honor of Ginsburg, who was born and raised in Brooklyn. Separately, Andrew Cuomo, Governor of New York, announced that a statue of Ginsburg would be installed in Brooklyn. He said he would appoint a commission to the task of selecting an artist and location. Across the state of New York, landmarks were lit in blue as a tribute to Ginsburg on September 19. These included the One World Trade Center, Grand Central Terminal, Kosciuszko Bridge, Niagara Falls, and Mid-Hudson Bridge. Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi introduced legislation for a bust of Ginsburg to be created and installed in the Capital Rotunda. In Minnesota, Mayor Jacob Frey of Minneapolis and Mayor Melvin Carter of St. Paul issued a proclamation declaring September 21 to be \\"Ruth Bader Ginsburg Day\\" in their respective cities. On September 25, 2020, the Empire State Building in New York City was lit in Red, White and Blue in honor of Ginsburg.  Reactions  = United States = Ginsburg's legal career was highlighted by legal figures including Chief Justice John Roberts who called her a \\"jurist of historic stature\\", stating that the Supreme Court had lost a cherished colleague and also had confidence that future generations would remember her as a \\"tireless and resolute champion of justice.\\" Her death was announced while both President Trump and presidential candidate Joe Biden were campaigning in Minnesota, with Trump holding a speech during his rally and Biden on a campaign plane flying back to Wilmington, Delaware, with spotty Wi-Fi connection. As a result, both men did not make statements immediately after the news was announced; after the speech concluded, Trump was heading towards Air Force One when he made a statement, and after Biden landed at New Castle Airport, he too made a statement. Trump, hearing about Ginsburg's death for the first time, said Ginsburg \\"was an amazing woman who led an amazing life\\". Biden told reporters that her death was \\"very sad news\\" and highlighted the need to choose a successor after the election. The White House also issued a statement praising Ginsburg, saying, among other things, \\"Her opinions, including well-known decisions regarding the legal equality of women and the disabled, have inspired all Americans and generations of great legal minds.\\" Speaker Pelosi used Twitter to express her sympathy, saying that Ginsburg's death was \\"an incalculable loss for our democracy and for all who sacrifice and strive to build a better future for our children\\". Governor Cuomo described Ginsburg as someone who \\"pursued truth and justice in a world of division, giving voice to the voiceless and uplifting those who were pushed aside by forces of hate and indifference\\". Hillary Clinton, who was the First Lady when Ginsburg was appointed to the Supreme Court, said \\"There will never be another like her.\\" On September 20, former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who nominated Ginsburg to the U.S. Supreme Court and also held a public rally with her in Little Rock, Arkansas, just over a year before her death, paid tribute to Ginsburg in a televised interview with Face the Nation Margaret Brennan, stating, among other things, that \\"People were really pulling for her and they really gravitated to her because of her sense of equality and fairness, and they thought, unlike much in politics today, she was totally on the level.\\" Senator Bernie Sanders issued condolences and admiration for Ginsburg via social media, as did several celebrities, politicians, and athletes including Mindy Kaling, the Duchess of Sussex, Kate McKinnon, Stacey Abrams, Orlando Jones and Meghan McCain. During a September 21 appearance on Fox & Friends, President Trump, without offering any evidence, suggested that Ginsburg's dictated statement before her death may have been manufactured by the Democratic political leadership in Congress, including Speaker Pelosi, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Minority Leader who represents New York, and Representative Adam Schiff of Caifornia. The Democrats angrily denied Trump's suggestion. The NPR correspondent Nina Totenberg, a reporter covering Supreme Court who published the original report about Justice Ginsburg's last wish, subsequently confirmed the account. Totenberg stated that there were other witnesses in the room, apart from her granddaughter, including her doctor. Trump's allegation gave birth to a conspiracy theory which spread quickly through social media and was taken up by some conservative public figures. Fox News host Tucker Carlson declared that it would have been \\"pathetic\\" for Justice Ginsburg to make such a dying declaration and that he does not believe she said it. Subsequently, Senator Ted Cruz, Republican from Texas, blocked the U.S. Senate resolution honoring Ginsburg over the language referring to her dying wish therein. = International = Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, described Ginsburg as a \\"pioneer for women's right, law and justice. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, wrote: \\"A profound and fearless advocate for women, equality, and justice, Ruth Bader Ginsburg's impact will undoubtedly be felt for generations. My thoughts are with her family, colleagues, and all who were inspired by her lifetime of service.\\" French president Emmanuel Macron wrote: \\"A truly exceptional woman has left us. Throughout her entire life, Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for justice, gender equality, and respect for fundamental rights. Her outstanding legacy shall be our inspiration for a long time to come.\\" Emily Haber, German ambassador to the U.S., wrote: \\"Germany has often looked across the Atlantic, not only to the US but to Justice Ginsburg herself – a pioneer for women, a standard- bearer, a fighter.\\" Pedro Sánchez, Prime Minister of Spain, sent his \\"deepest condolences to her family, to the world of Justice and to the American people.\\"  Funeral services  = Supreme Court Building = Ginsburg's casket at the top of the Supreme Court steps, flanked by two of her former law clerks and an honor guard from the Supreme Court Police Ginsburg lay in repose at the Supreme Court Building for the two days on September 23–24. Previous ceremonies for Associate Justices were limited to a single day, including the ceremony for Chief Justice William Rehnquist as well as those for Associate Justices William J. Brennan Jr., John Paul Stevens, and Antonin Scalia. Her public viewing was held outdoors from 11am to 10 pm on the first day, and 9am to 10pm on the second day. Ginsburg is the first woman to lie in repose at the Supreme Court. Her funeral began at around 9:30am on September 23 when her casket arrived at the Supreme Court. More than 100 of her law clerks from her time as an appellate judge and Supreme Court justice lined the steps. Eight officers from the Supreme Court Police carried the casket up the steps into the Supreme Court and placed it atop the catafalque previously used for the funeral of Abraham Lincoln. Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt of Adas Israel Congregation, a Conservative Judaism synagogue in Washington, D.C., began the ceremony with a chanting of \\"Adonai Roi\\", a song of mourning from Psalm 23, in both Hebrew and English, and ended with \\"El Malei Rachamim\\", the prayer about a merciful God traditionally said for the departed. The rabbi, who was an adviser to Justice Ginsburg and is the wife of Ari Holtzblatt, one of Ginsburg's former law clerks, eulogized the justice as \\"an American hero\\". She also said, \\"It's the rare prophet who not only imagines a new world but also makes that new world a reality in her lifetime. This was the brilliance and vision of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\\" This was followed by a eulogy from Chief Justice Roberts who described Ginsburg as a \\"rock star... tough, brave, a fighter, a winner, but also thoughtful, careful, compassionate, honest.\\" In attendance at the short ceremony inside were all eight remaining justices as well as Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was retired. At around 11am, Ginsburg's casket was brought outside and placed near the top of the Supreme Court steps. Hundreds of people stood in line awaiting their turn to pay their respects. A winding metal barricade had been installed on East Capitol Street to accommodate the queue. The crowd filled the blocked-off street from 1st to 2nd Street and extended onto the sidewalk on 2nd Street all the way up to the parking lot of the Thomas Jefferson Building. Some had come from Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Vermont. Several public figures also visited the casket on the first day, including Vice President Mike Pence and Second Lady Karen Pence, and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. A large group of lawmakers from the Democratic Party also visited the casket, including Senator Schumer as well as Senators Ed Markey of Massachusetts, Chris Coons of Delaware, and Patrick Leahy of Vermont. Bernie Sanders, an independent senator from Vermont, and Susan Collins, a Republican senator from Maine, also paid their respects. The following day, Ginsburg's casket was again placed at the top of the Supreme Court steps. President Trump and First Lady Melania Trump visited the casket just before 10am. By then, people had begun gathering to await their turn to approach the casket. A crowd began booing and shouting at President Trump when he appeared behind the casket. Chants heard included: \\"Vote him out!\\" and \\"Honor her wish\\", a reference to Ginsburg's dictated statement days before her death that a successor not be appointed \\"until a new president is installed\\". = Capitol Building = Ginsburg lay in state at the United States Capitol on September 25; she is both the first Jewish person and the first woman to achieve this honor. Ginsburg is the second justice to be honored in this way since Chief Justice William Howard Taft, who was the 27th president before being appointed to the court. That morning, her casket was placed in a hearse that transported it from the Supreme Court Building to the Capitol, which is across the street. The hearse briefly paused before the Supreme Court before proceeding to the entrance of the Capitol. At around 10am, a US military honor guard carried the casket up the steps of the Capitol into the National Statuary Hall. The honor guard was led by Shaye Lynne Haver, one of the first two women to graduate from the US Army Ranger School. After the casket was again placed on Lincoln's catafalque, the military honor guard was replaced by an honor guard of four from the Capitol Police, who stood at each of the casket's four corners. Speaker Pelosi opened the ceremony with a speech honoring Ginsburg. This was followed by the mezzo-soprano Denyce Graves, one of Ginsburg's favorite opera singers, singing the spiritual \\"Deep River\\" accompanied by Laura Ward on piano. Rabbi Holtzblatt, who had eulogized the justice two days before at the Supreme Court, returned for another eulogy at the Capitol. Graves then sang Gene Scheer's \\"American Anthem\\". The ceremony concluded with the current and former lawmakers in attendance each approaching the casket to pay their respects. While several Republicans attended the ceremony, McConnell and House minority leader Kevin McCarthy were not present. A US Army veteran who was Ginsburg's physical trainer, Bryant Johnson, later did three push-ups in front of the casket. An honor guard of at least two Capitol Police officers remained with the casket at all times while Ginsburg lay in state. At around 12:50pm, the military honor guard brought the casket out of the Capitol, down the steps, and into a hearse which, flanked by police vehicles, drove away from the Capitol plaza, thus concluding the publicly-held honors for Ginsburg. = Arlington National Cemetery = On September 29, a separate private funeral service was held at Arlington National Cemetery where she was buried beside her husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, a US Army veteran. The ceremony was officiated by Rabbi Lauren Holtzblatt with only \\"family, close friends, justices, and Ginsburg's staff\\" in attendance. The ceremony concluded with a playing of opera singer Leontyne Price singing two songs by Giacomo Puccini. The grave is located in Section 5 where nine other justices are also buried, including three with whom Ginsburg had served.  Aftermath  In The Washington Post, James Hohmann wrote that the death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and by proxy the upcoming confirmation hearings for her replacement on the United States Supreme Court, would have a \\"seismic\\" effect on the U.S. political landscape in the run-up to the 2020 United States presidential and Congressional elections. The Financial Times described Ginsburg's death as adding \\"uncertainty to [the] volatile election\\". Ginsburg's death opened a vacancy on the Supreme Court about six weeks before the presidential election, initiating controversies regarding the nomination and confirmation of her successor. The issue of abortion, which had been mostly on a backburner until that point, became a focal point of the election campaign after Ginsburg's death. On the Republican side, President Trump's decision to quickly proceed with the nomination of a replacement for Ginsburg on the Supreme Court appeared to bring back together and energize the anti-abortion Evangelicals and conservatives, some of whom had began to drift away from Trump earlier. As one of the White House officials told The Washington Post shortly after Ginsburg's death: \\"This is an animating issue for the entire right. It unifies everybody from Mitt Romney to the most hardcore MAGA Trump person out there at a time when Trump needed that.\\" In the hours following news of her death, more than $20million was donated to various Democratic politicians via the ActBlue fundraising hub, more than quintuple the previous record amount. Donations through ActBlue were reported to be around $80million within 24 hours and more than $100 million in the four days immediately following Ginsburg's death. Of that amount, more than $20 million came in donations through a \\"Get Mitch or Die Trying\\" online campaign run by former Obama administration officials, who now host Pod Save America. Many Democrats, angered by Trump's and McConnell's decision to proceed with the confirmation for Ginsburg's replacement so close to the election, especially in view of the promises made during Merrick Garland's denied nomination in 2016, again discussed the possibility of increasing the size of the U.S. Supreme Court if the Democrats take control of the Presidency and the Congress after the November 2020 election. Biden's presidential campaign sought to link Justice Ginsburg's death with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and other healthcare issues, particularly the ongoing Supreme Court case California v. Texas regarding the fate of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, where the court is set to hear the arguments a week after the election date. The Trump administration supports the effort in California v. Texas to overturn Obamacare. Biden accuses Trump of trying to eliminate the widely popular pre-existing conditions protections, which are a part of Obamacare. The stakes for Obamacare's fate are heightened by Ginsburg's departure from the court, as in her previous opinions she expressed support for the validity of the Affordable Care Act. Legal analysts also noted that Justice Ginsburg's absence from the Supreme Court could significantly affect the outcome of various legal challenges related to the presidential election, including those related to absentee and mail voting. President Trump indicated that he specifically wants Ginsburg's replacement on the Supreme Court to be confirmed by the November 3 election date because he expects the court to resolve the disputes about the election outcome. On September 26, Trump officially announced his nomination of Amy Coney Barrett. The event at which the announcement was made was attended by many notable GOP figures with little regard for COVID-19 precautions, likely leading to the White House COVID-19 outbreak.

Completed and commissioned in October 1944, she served in World War II and conducted transport missions between Japan and outlying islands. The last Japanese transport submarine to visit the Japanese base at Truk, she surrendered at the end of the war and was scrapped in 1946. Construction and commissioning I-369 was laid down on 1 September 1943 by the Yokosuka Navy Yard at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5469. She was renamed on 25 January 1944 and provisionally attached to the Sasebo Naval District that day. She was launched on 9 March 1944 and completed and commissioned on 9 October 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-369 was attached formally to the Yokosuka Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. With her workups complete, she was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 15 December 1944. On 21 January 1945, I-369 departed Yokosuka bound for Marcus Island on her first transport mission. She arrived at Marcus on 28 January 1945, unloaded her cargo, and got back underway to return to Yokosuka, which she reached on 5 February 1945. She again left Yokosuka on 12 February for her second supply voyage. After delivering her cargo at Chichijima in the Bonin Islands, she returned to Yokosuka on 21 February 1945. On 20 March 1945, Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated, and I-369 was reassigned to Submarine Division 16 along with the submarines , , , and . I-369 got underway from Yokosuka on 16 April for her third and final transport voyage, this time setting course for Truk and Mereyon Island at Woleai in the Caroline Islands. The last Japanese transport submarine to visit Truk, she arrived there on 1 May 1945 and unloaded 0.312 metric tons of food, 6.303 metric tons of weapons and ammunition, 25 metric tons of fuel, and 4.4 metric tons of other cargo. Departing Truk on 3 May 1945, she proceeded to Mereyon, where she arrived after dark on 7 May 1945 and unloaded 38.9 metric tons of food and 2.6 metric tons of other cargo. She also embarked two boxes of the cremated remains of deceased Japanese military personnel and 60 passengers, including the surviving crew members of an 801st Naval Air Group Kawanishi H8K (Allied reporting name \\"Emily\\") flying boat which had landed there after serving as a pathfinder aircraft for Operation Tan No. 2, an 11 March 1945 Japanese kamikaze attack against the American fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll. She departed Mereyon on 11 May 1945 and completed her voyage with her arrival at Yokosuka on 24 May 1945. On 25 May 1945, I-369 began conversion at Yokosuka into a tanker submarine capable of carrying 100 metric ton of aviation gasoline.Senshi Sōsho Vol.88 (1975), p.272-273 She was still under conversion and in a partially dismantled state when hostilities between Japan and the Allies ended on 15 August 1945. She surrendered to the Allies on 30 August 1945. Disposal The Japanese struck I-369 from the Navy list on 15 September 1945. She was scrapped at Yokosuka in 1946.

She previously led the development of the HPV vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine, and is working with BioNTech to create a COVID-19 vaccine.  Early life and education  Jansen was born in Erfurt and grew up in East Germany. She was frequently unwell as a child, and suffered several throat infections. The medical treatment she received from her father (antibiotics, codeine) inspired her to pursue a career in drug development. Her family fled to West Germany before the Berlin Wall was constructed. To transport Jansen across the border, her aunt pretended that she was her child, giving her some sleeping pills so that she didn't wake up and tell the border patrol the truth. She eventually studied biology at the University of Marburg, with the hope to work in the pharmaceutical industry. Whilst she was an undergraduate, Rudolf K. Thauer arrived at the university, and established a department of microbiology. Jansen completed her doctoral degree at the University of Marburg, where she studied chemical pathways in bacteria. After earning her degree, Jansen moved to Cornell University as a Alexander von Humboldt Foundation postdoctoral fellow investigating the function of the acetylcholine receptor with George Paul Hess. In particular, Jansen focussed on the yeast expression of multi-subunit neuronal receptors.  Research and career  Jansen was fascinated by the development of novel pharmaceuticals, and wanted to return to Europe, so moved to Geneva to join the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology. At the Glaxo Institute for Molecular Biology Jansen encouraged the immunologists to create a novel receptor for immunoglobulin E. She completed an internship in the laboratory of David Bishop at the University of Oxford, where she studied the expression of insect cells using baculoviridae. In 1992 Jansen moved back to the United States, where she joined the vaccine division at Merck & Co.. She became interested in making vaccinations, and started work on the human papillomavirus infection. Soon after Jian Zhou and Ian Frazer started work on the HPV vaccine, proposing that the proteins of the human papillomavirus infection virus-like particles could be self assembled into something that could be used as a vaccine. Jansen proposed the vaccine should be made in yeast, a substrate which Merck & Co. had previously used for the Hepatitis B vaccine. Various innovations were required to ensure that the yeast did not degrade the virus like particles, and prevent their aggregation. Jansen managed to convince Edward Scolnick that the experimental vaccine was worth pursuing, and started to make the assays. Jansen worked with Laura Koutsky at the University of Washington to conduct natural history studies that informed the phase 2 clinical trials. In 2002 the vaccination was proven 100% effective, and Jansen left the Merck & Co. knowing that the vaccination would be a success. She joined VaxGen in 2004, where she was appointed Chief Scientific Officer. In 2006 Jansen left VaxGen to join Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in 2006, where she was responsible for vaccine discovery. Here she developed the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar-13). In 2010 Jansen was appointed adjunct professor at the University of Pennsylvania. Jansen is concerned about the rise of vaccine hesitancy. During a conference at Pfizer in 2019, she said “I don't know what motivates an individual to ignore scientific facts. As scientists, it is our obligation to rectify misinformation and to provide the facts on what we know and what we don't know,”. During the COVID-19 pandemic Jansen oversaw the development of the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine. She looked at four potential candidates, before joining with BioNTech to improve the likelihood of identifying the vaccine with the highest potential. To test efficacy, Jansen and Pfizer are working under guidance from the Food and Drug Administration and conducting a 30,000 patient study. In July 2020 Jansen announced positive results in their clinical trials, resulting in an increase in the share price of Pfizer.

He showed very good form as a two-year-old in 2019 when he won two races including the Juvenile Stakes as well as finishing fourth in the Vertem Futurity Trophy. He improved to become a top-class middle distance performer in the following year, winning the Gordon Stakes and the Grand Prix de Paris. Background Mogul is a bay horse with a white star and snip and four white socks bred in the England by the Hertfordshire-based Newsells Park Stud. In October 2018 the yearling was put up for auction at Tattersalls and was bought for 3.4 million guineas by Michael Magnier on behalf of the Coolmore Stud. He was sent into training with Aidan O'Brien at Ballydoyle and raced in the colours of the Coolmore partners Derrick Smith, Susan Magnier and Michael Tabor. He was sired by Galileo, who won the Derby, Irish Derby and King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes in 2001. Galileo became one of the world's leading stallions, earning his eleventh champion sire of Great Britain and Ireland title in 2019. His other progeny include Frankel, Nathaniel, New Approach, Rip Van Winkle, Found, Minding, Love and Ruler of the World. Mogul's dam Shastye showed above average racing ability, winning two minor races and running second in the Listed Pontefract Castle Stakes. She did better as a broodmare, producing several other winners including Secret Gesture (runner-up in the Epsom Oaks), Isaac Newton (International Stakes) and Mogul's full- brother Japan. Shastye was a half-sister to Sagamix and closely related to Sagawara, Nasram, Lope de Vega and Tambourine. Racing career =2019: two- year-old season= Mogul was ridden by his trainer's son Donnacha O'Brien when he made his racecourse debut on 14 August in a maiden race over one mile at Gowran Park in which he started the 5/4 favourite and finished second to the Jim Bolger-trained Geometrical. The colt was partnered by Ryan Moore when he recorded his first success in a similar event at the Curragh, leading from the start and coming home three and a quarter lengths clear of his eleven opponents at odds of 8/13. Moore was again in the saddle when Mogul was stepped up in class and started 1/2 favourite for the Group 2 Champions Juvenile Stakes over one mile at Leopardstown Racecourse on 14 September. He raced in fourth place as his stablemate Cormorant set the pace before moving up to take the lead a furlong and a half from the finish and kept on well to win by one and a quarter lengths from the second favourite Sinawann. After the race Aidan O'Brien commented \\"We were delighted with him. He was trapped a little bit wide today and there was a nice pace on so he learned plenty... we've been very happy with his progress form race to race so hopefully he'll progress on again... We won't over-race him... we think he's a Classic horse\\". The Group 1 Vertem Futurity Trophy had been planned for Doncaster Racecourse on 26 October but owing to the waterlogged state or the turf track it was rescheduled to take place six days later on the synthetic Tapeta surface at Newcastle Racecourse. With Donnacha O'Brien in the saddle, Mogul started second favourite but despite racing making good progress from the rear of the field in the last quarter mile he came home fourth behind Kameko, Innisfree and Year of the Tiger. =2020: three-year-old season= The 2020 flat racing season in England and Ireland was disrupted by the COVID-19 Pandemic and Mogul did not make his reappearance until 16 June when he was sent to England to contest the Group 2 King Edward VII Stakes over twelve furlongs at the Royal Ascot. Owing to the restructuring of the programme the race became, for the first time, a trial race for the Epsom Derby. He started the 10/11 favourite but after racing towards the rear of the six-runner field he was unable to make any real progress in the straight and came home fourth behind Pyledriver. The 241st running of the Epsom Derby took place a month later than usual, behind closed doors, over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse on 4 July and Mogul started the 7/1 third favourite in a seventeen-runner field. Ridden by Moore he raced in mid-division before making steady progress in the straight but never looked likely to win and finished sixth behind his unfancied stablemate Serpentine beaten seven lengths by the winner. On 30 July at Goodwood Racecourse Mogul contested the Group 3 Gordon Stakes and went off the 9/2 third choice in the betting behind English King (winner of the Lingfield Derby Trial) and Al Aasy (Bahrain Trophy) in a field which also included Subjectivist (Glasgow Stakes) and Khalifa Sat (runner-up in the Derby). Moore positioned the colt just behind the leaders before moving up on the outside in the straight. He gained the advantage inside the final furlong and won by three quarters of a length from Highland Chief. After the race Aidan O'Brien said \\"We always felt he was a lovely horse, but we always felt he was going to take two runs and we were hoping to get that into him before the Derby. Obviously the Derby was only his second run and today was his third... he's a big, strong, powerful horse who carries a lot of weight, so it was always going to take racing to get him tuned up. We were delighted with him today and we still think there's more to come from him\\". Mogul reappeared in the Great Voltigeur Stakes at York Racecourse on 19 August and started favourite but after being contention for most of the way he was beaten into third place behind Pyledriver and Highland Chief. On 13 September Mogul was sent to France for the Grand Prix de Paris over 2400 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he was ridden by Pierre-Charles Boudot. The race had previously been run in June or July but had been rescheduled owing to the COVID-19 Pandemic. He was made the 8.5/1 fifth choice in the betting behind Port Guillaume (Prix Hocquart), Serpentine, English King and In Swoop (Deutsches Derby). Mogul raced towards the rear of the field as his stablemate Nobel Prize set the pace but made rapid progress along the inside rail in the straight before being switched left and taking the lead 300 metres from the finish. He quickly established a clear advantage and won by two and a half lengths from the fast-finishing In Swoop. O'Brien who watched the race on television said \\"He's been showing so much speed, I thought we might be going the wrong way and maybe we should be going back to a mile and a quarter... He's obviously a fast horse, and he's able to quicken\\". Pedigree *Mogul is inbred 3 × 4 to Northern Dancer, meaning that this stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

Early life  Descended from Devon gentry, Alexandra Nott was the only daughter of Sir John Nott, former Member of Parliament for St Ives and Secretary of State for Defence under Margaret Thatcher during the Falklands War, by his wife Miloska Vlahović, daughter of Yugoslav resistance leader Lujo Vlahović, of Slovenian extraction. Her elder and younger brothers, Julian and William Nott, both attended Eton College, while she was educated at Cranborne Chase School. She then pursued further studies at St Martin's School of Art, where she was a contemporary of the fashion designer John Galliano.  Diaries  Swire's book, Diary of an MP's Wife: Inside and Outside Power, was published on 24 September 2020.

Completed and commissioned in October 1944, she served in World War II and was sunk while returning from her first transport mission in February 1945. Construction and commissioning I-371 was laid down on 22 March 1944 by Mitsubishi at Kobe, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 5471. She was launched on 21 July 1944 and renamed I-371 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 2 October 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-371 was attached to the Sasebo Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 6 December 1944. During December 1944, she moved from the Seto Inland Sea to Yokosuka and began a 20-day period of workups from there. =Transport voyage= On 30 December 1944, I-371 departed Yokosuka bound for Truk and Mereyon Island at Woleai in the Caroline Islands on her first transport mission, carrying a cargo of 50 metric tons of food and mail, as well as aviation gasoline, spare parts, and ammunition for the Truk-based 171st Naval Air Group, which the aviators required to resume flights by Nakajima C6N1 Saiun (\\"Iridescent Cloud\\"; Allied reporting name \\"Myrt\\") reconnaissance aircraft over the American fleet anchorage at Ulithi Atoll. She arrrived at Truk on 18 January 1945 and unloaded the portion of her cargo destined for Truk. During her stay, an Aichi E13A1 (Allied reporting name \\"Jake\\") floatplane arrived from Mereyon on 20 January 1945 with a coded message about I-371′s planned arrival there. On 22 January 1945 I-371 got underway from Truk bound for Mereyon, which she reached at around 22:00 on 25 January 1945. She unloaded 50 metric tons of food and mail, allowing an increase in the daily ration of rice for each member of the starving Japanese garrison on Mereyon from .

Lagarto sank the submarine at . Her victim probably was I-371, although I-371 would have been running three days behind schedule to be in that location at that time. Other accounts credit the destroyer with sinking I-371 off Okinawa on 23 March 1945, but that was 11 days after the Japanese had declared I-371 missing, and it is more likely that Haggard sank the submarine . On 12 March 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy declared to be presumed lost in the vicinity of Truk along with all 84 crew and passengers on board. She was stricken from the Navy list on 10 April 1945.

One of them is lashing it with a stick, while the putto next to him is reaching his left hand to the hovering stick. One putto is hanging over the goat's back with both hands, while another putto is breaking another stick off a tree to the left. Bellori says that the model in chalk was imitated by a local sculptor noted for his work with porphyry. According to Bellori, Cardinal Francesco Barberini donated the relief to Philip IV of Spain, and at the time of writing it was kept at the Royal Palace of Madrid. The relief is currently housed at the Galleria Doria Pamphili in Rome. Duquesnoy's Bacchanal of Putti is closely related to Nicolas Poussin's own paintings. Both Duquesnoy's Bacchanal of Putti and Poussin's painting of the same name reflect the study of ancient sarcophagi of the Flemish sculptor and the French painter. Duquesnoy would go on to improve his putti, until he reached the apotheosis of the putto with his putti of the Tomb of Ferdinand van den Eynde.

It was established by result of the decoupling of the existing Ghana Civil Aviation Authority(GCAA) which was in line with current trends that are in the aviation industry.  History  The GACL assumed some functions of the GCAA and also managing the airports after the amendment of the GCAA Act 2004, which was renewed on the 12th April 2007 and was licensed for continuous term of 7 years. The company started business on 1st January 2007.  Mission and Vision Statements  The Vision of the GACL is to position Ghana as the Preferred Aviation hub and leader in Airport Business in West Africa. The Mission of the company is to provide world-class airport facilities and airstrips in Ghana.  Functions of GACL  The functions of the company are to: * Provide rescue and firefighting equipment and services at the airports. * Provide safety and security for aircraft, passengers, cargo in accordance with best international practices. * Coordinate operations of agencies that provide support services at the airport to enhance overall efficiency. * Facilitate aircraft, passenger, cargo and mail movements. * Develop, manage and maintain airports and airstrips in Ghana.  Projects  The GACL constructed the Terminal 3 at the KIA in March 2016 and was completed in June 2018 and was opened to the public after 3 months. It was claimed about US$350million was spent on the building of the Terminal 3 and other projects at KIA. The construction of a new runway at the Tamale Airport also was claimed to have cost about US$130million. Also, about US$25million was used for the building of a new airport at Ho in the Volta region of Ghana.  Controversies  It was alleged the Government of Ghana through the Ministry of Aviation planned to hand over the company to a Turkish investor. The workers of GACL embarked on a demonstration to show their disapproval of privatization of the company. The GACL clarified that travelers who did not pay for the Covid-19 test would be handed to state security officials. They made this statement after it was alleged some people were treated badly in a video that was circulating on social media.  Challenges  Due to the impact of Covid-19, the company has been affected as it is struggling with lack of demand and increased unit charges. This has led to costs being passed to other sectors of the travel value chain to cover up the space.

Life  Dresden Portal Schlossgasse of the Residenzschloss, engraving from the Weck Chronicle 1680 Buchner grew up in Nuremberg and learnt the carpentry trade and the art of screw making from his cousin Leonhard Danner. 1556 he entered the service of the English queen Elisabeth I. in London. His task was to produce screw works, which were used to destroy fortifications. In 1557 Duke Emanuel Philibert of Savoy invited him to Brussels. Recommended by Leonhard Danner, who supplied military equipment for the Saxon court, Elector August of Saxony summoned August of Saxony Buchner 1558 to Dresden. At first he made screw tools and 1559 he was appointed electoral master craftsman and 1563 commander of the Dresden arsenal. He worked together with Caspar Voigt von Wierandt, an experienced architect and master witness. From 1567 he was in charge of the supervision of the extension of the Dresden fortifications. Due to his extensive knowledge of fortress construction and weapons technology, Buchner was appointed master of the house and land in 1575. He was thus responsible for all fortifications, armouries and weapons in Saxony. 1586 to 1590 Paul Buchner built the Dresden Stallhof (The Stable Building) at the Jüdenhof under Elector Christian I.

History  It was not originally planned to place a station in northern Hausjärvi upon the construction of the Helsinki–Hämeenlinna railway; however, presumably from the initiative of the Granfelt family, the owners of the estate of Ryttylä, a station was eventually established in 1863.

A new station building, once again designed by Nylander, was finished in 1900, and it served the station until 1973; upon its demolition, the former building of the station chief was used. The station enabled growth in Ryttylä, and it became site to various industries, including a brick factory. Ryttylä's population was 1,300 in 1960, though its growth has diminished since, and it was instead Oitti that became the largest and most important urban area of Hausjärvi, similarly aided by its station along the Riihimäki–Saint Petersburg railway.

By the age of nine she was already singing coloratura arias at societies such as those of Rosine, Luise and Amina. At the age of 13, she performed a rondo by Mozart at a public concert. She also appeared occasionally as the female lead in the opera Die vierzehn Nothelfer by . Despite her success with the public, her parents had reservations about a stage career for their daughter. A friend of the family then asked the opera singer Pauline Lucca to talk the girl out of her career aspirations, which she agreed to do.

His nicknames included the \\"Old Hawk\\". \\"The Gudeman of Blacklunans\\" and \\"Archdeacon of the Self-Elected\\". In his role in Dundee he failed in his hope to create a neo- classical town in the manner of Edinburgh but nevertheless did much to change its cityscape and history.

Wealthy, he loaned the town council £300 in 1778 (this was normal in those days). He was a popular and intelligent man not only joined the Town Council in September 1776 but was also asked to immediately serve as Treasurer. Projects were sometimes personally funded by the Treasurer at this time. These included rebuilding \\"The Singing Pier\\" and the South Pier and paving the roads leading to these.https://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/ArtfulandAmbitiousIndividual_r.pdf In 1788 he was elected Provost in succession to John Pitcairn. Dundee operated a plan which held elections for local officials every two years, but did not allow a provost to serve two consecutive terms. Riddoch served an unequalled total of eight terms as Provost, ending in 1818, and was undoubtedly one of Dundee's most popular and noteworthy politicians.http://www.fdca.org.uk/Provosts_LordProvosts.html In his first term as Provost in 1789 he organised a new pier to accommodate the larger vessels being used in sea trade. In this same year he received a petition from the Dundee Reform Committee led by Patrick Stirling and Ebenezer Anderson.http://www.fdca.org.uk/pdf%20files/TradeShippingDundee.pdf In 1790 he commissioned the town architect Samuel Bell to create Nethergate House, a fine villa in central Dundee.https://www.scottish- places.info/features/featurefirst8860.html In Dundee he had a close relationship with George Dempster MP from whom it is said he acquired a rather cavalier attitude to finances and sadly was latterly accused of taking financial advantage of his position, despite clear evidence that he was more than happy to support the town with his own monies. Together with Dempster he founded the Dundee Commercial Banking Company in 1792.https://www.natwestgroup.com/heritage/companies/dundee-commercial- banking-co.html Riddoch's term of control covered what might be considered as Dundee's heyday. Projects included the building of Dundee Infirmary and major expansion of Dundee docks. Castle Street, Tay Street and Crichton Street were built and the Nethergait was widened.https://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/ArtfulandAmbitiousIndividual_r.pdf In 1793 the first flax mills appeared in Dundee (in Guthrie Street and Chapelshade) and Dundee's prosperity began to rocket.https://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2017/08/dundee_textile_industry.pdf From at least 1793 he invested in production of sailcloth, partnered with Thomas Webster of Hawkhill and Alexander Strachan (in rivalry to Mr Graham of Fintry). This specifically linked to the Royal Navy's wave of shipbuilding linked to the Napoleonic Wars. Riddoch, Webster and Strachan also jointly invested in rope-making and the whaling industry. He was partner in Thomas and Riddoch, a \\"twist mill\\" (thread mill) in the Murraygait. He also had major shares in the Wemyss mill on Seagait. He shared a timber yard with Baillie Peddie near the Castle Hill. He had a major share in the glassworks at Carolina Port. On 16 November 1792 he was involved in a local riot where the rioters planted a \\"Tree of Liberty\\" in the High Street and obliged him (as provost) to dance around it three times reciting their dictated words: Liberty and Equality Forever\\".The Dundee Book p.93, by Billy Kay In 1796 he bought the Blacklunans estate and, in the Scottish tradition, was thereafter addressed by the title \\"Blacklunans\\". Blacklunans lies between Blairgowrie and Braemar.https://www.scottish- places.info/towns/townfirst1338.html Improvements to the harbour of 1804 (sanctioned by Riddoch in his Council role) led to great criticism that Peddie and Riddoch's timber yard was hugely increased in value. It was this action which, rightly or wrongly, brought about his public criticism. This criticism was worsened by a two-penny tax on ale in the town to pay for the improvements. The council's expenditure on street improvements were causing considerable debt. The project was relaunched in 1810 as the Dundee Harbour Bill but was heavily opposed and a government enquiry revealed that previous harbour dues had not been re-invested in the harbour as required. This partly reflected on Riddoch as Provost but there was more evidence that his cronies had misappropriated the funds.https://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/ArtfulandAmbitiousIndividual_r.pdf In the early 19th century he came into political conflict with the local radicals, George Kinloch and Robert Rintoul. The latter became editor of the Dundee Weekly Advertiser in 1808. These radicals further divided the views of the city and accused Riddoch of not sufficiently improving the harbour to meet contemporary needs.https://muse.jhu.edu/article/707795/pdf Meanwhile, the town improvements were becoming costly. The widening of the Nethergate met opposition amongst the wealthier owners who asked for the Sheriff to mitigate the poor sums offered by the council. The house of Alexander Garland, a wealthy tobacconist, ruled in Garland's favour and resulted in a large bill to the council. Consequently, in 1811 a resolution was made to accurately revalue all heritable property in Dundee.https://abertay.org.uk/wp- content/uploads/2019/01/ArtfulandAmbitiousIndividual_r.pdf In 1814, as a major step towards a new harbour, with the commissioning of Robert Stevenson to undertake a full survey of the existing docks. The plans for a new dock continued to be opposed, not for reason of the principle, but for the proposed raising of harbour dues, and local merchants made an alternate plan which was to be run by a Harbour Trust rather than the Town Council. After some argument Thomas Telford was appointed to execute the works in preference to Stevenson, who was thought to favour using land owned by Riddoch. However, whether persuaded by Riddoch or not, Telford concluded that a new dock was not needed. Nevertheless, the Dundee Harbour Act was eventually passed in 1815.https://archiveshub.jisc.ac.uk/search/archives/e6dc4ac8-7d35-3b61-9fa1-e672c8d415ea Riddoch stepped down as Provost (permanently) in 1819, aged 74, somewhat worn down by the tribulations of his later years in office and absence of public appreciation for his efforts. His final act involved a summons to London to explain his part in the alleged corruption of the Scottish burghs, a trip he made with his erstwhile rivals, Robert Rintoul and James Saunders. He died in his house on the Nethergate on 9 December 1822 aged 78http://dundeehowff.org.uk/tombsofdundeehowff/wall/w16.htm and is buried in The Howff burial ground in central Dundee.http://www.fdca.org.uk/Howff_History.html At the time of his death he was owed £2000 by the city and various city individuals.

Now I will be a missionary so I can talk about the word of God with others. I’ll play soccer again, but everything is in the Lord’s hands. The missionaries continued teaching me, and a few months later I was baptized. Ever since I was a little boy, I dreamed of becoming a professional soccer player and maybe playing in Europe. You have no idea how much I will miss playing. But for now, I need to fulfill a mission for the Lord It was also reported, that Gallardo had got his contract terminated by mutual agreement already on 5 May 2019, so he could “assume personal commitments for two years, regardless of official activities in the ‘King Sport’ during that period of time”.Sporting Cristal: Paulo Gallardo, de 18 años, se retiró del fútbol por motivos religiosos, trome.pe, 8 December 2019 Gallardo also became a convert to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter- day Saints.

Due to my mental health, I decided to return, but I was not the same, neither was my physical condition, so it was a very difficult year-end for me. Personally, I went through very hard situations and with my family I also had a hard time. They were very difficult moments in my life. I have my attitude and dedication for things that have happened to me throughout my childhood. My fights were totally different, they were struggles with myself, emotional issues, problems with my family. I suffered bullying as a child, with insults throughout my formative stage. Teasing, offensive nicknames, events that over time led me to be a person who now knows how to better control his emotions, and I focus my energy on being better on the field, ”he says with some nostalgia.Decentralized: Sporting Cristal  Paulo Gallardo and his arduous journey for redemption and, depor.com, 21 July 2020 References External links * Category:Living people Category:2001 births Category:Association football forwards Category:Peruvian footballers Category:Peruvian Primera División players Category:Sporting Cristal footballers Category:Deportivo Municipal footballers Category:Sportspeople from Lima ","title":"Paulo Gallardo"},{"id":"65364060","text":"Aladdin and His Wonderful Lamp is a 1964 pantomime cast album by Cliff Richard, the Shadows, the Norrie Paramor orchestra and other members of the pantomime cast.

Braunstein and written by H. Perry Horton and Richard Schenkman. The film stars Jeff Fahey, Sara Malakul Lane, Marc Ewins, John Rhys-Davies and Judit Fekete. Its plot centers on a climatic disaster caused by a ash thrown into the atmosphere following a volcanic eruption in Iceland, devastating western Europe. The film was released direct-to-DVD on 13 April 2013. Plot A volcano in Iceland erupts, spewing a massive Volcanic ash cloud towards mainland Europe, with a tropical cyclone driving the cloud faster than anticipated towards Europe. Dr. Goldschein (Iván Kamarás), who prepared a model for this occurrence alerts NATO officer, Colonel Ralph Dillard (John Rhys-Davies), stationed in NATO Air Base Geilenkirchen, warning about the severity of the situation. As the model predicts, the volcanic eruption and its accompanying earthquakes trigger more volcanic eruptions across Europe, in Laacher See, Santorini, Mount Etna and the Canary Islands, sending more ash to the atmosphere. Steve Foster (Jeff Fahey), a recently divorced and newly married US Air Force Major is flying to Paris with his new wife, Lacey (Judit Fekete) in a small plane. The newly-wed couple is set to meet Foster's son Ryan (Marc Ewins) and daughter Taryn (Sara Malakul Lane), both taking college courses in Paris and yet to meet their new stepmother. The arrival of the ash cloud forces the couple to land their plane in London City Airport. Ryan and Taryn are on their way to the airport to meet their father and stepmother, when the air turns cold sharply and bad weather strikes Paris, sending grapefruit-sized hail into the streets. Soon afterwards an earthquake hits Paris. Ryan and Taryn seek refuge in the US embassy, only to find it deserted and in dangerous condition. The siblings find a fashion store where they find coats to warm themselves, only to be held at gunpoint by the store owner (Tamás Deák), escaping him when another tremor drops store shelves on both Taryn and the store owner. Ryan breaks her free and both escape the store. In England, the Fosters are trying to reach the Channel Tunnel to reach France. Foster calls Colonel Dillard, whose life he saved when they served together. Dillard arrange for a place on the Eurotunnel Shuttle for the couple and tell the Fosters that Geilenkirchen base personnel is being evacuated to Australia and that they have 10 hours to reach the base. Dillard direct them towards Évreux-Fauville Air Base, from which they would be able to take a helicopter towards Paris and collect Ryan and Taryn en route to Geilenkirchen. The Fosters reach the Channel Tunnel to find it backlogged with passengers trying to get to France. The couple drive through a barrier into the service tunnel and drive through. Tremors shake the tunnel, sending water in. The Fosters manage to reach France before the tunnel is flooded. Dillard calls to alert them of the extreme weather ahead, telling them he would bring Ryan and Taryn to Geilenkirchen In Paris Taryn and Ryan are trying to evade the French soldiers that round up citizens and evacuating the city and reach their rendezvous point set with their father at the Eiffel Tower. However, they are captured, along with Angelique (Zsófi Trecskó), a young woman they met briefly that morning. The three are taken by car outside of Paris, when the vehicle almost runs over two women. The driver avoids hitting them but runs the vehicle into a building instead. Both soldiers are rendered unconscious and the three escape the care before it explodes. They make their way on bikes towards the Eiffel Tower through a tunnel, where they are robbed by two thugs, leaving them without their bikes and their coats. The Fosters are run off the road by strong winds near Évreux and walk the rest of the way. At Évreux they take a helicopter, flying towards Paris through the storm. As the helicopter nears the Eiffel Tower, the Fosters spot the youngsters on the tower's second level. Lacey and Ryan attach a zipline from the helicopter to the tower and the three slides into the helicopter just as an ice tornado strikes the tower, ripping it apart. With the evacuation plane ready to take-off, the helicopter flies towards Geilenkirchen, its engines failing short of the base. Dillard heads a rescue mission and extracts the party from the helicopter, taking them to the plane and to safety.

The first landing was on 21 January 1948. Subsequently, the site was turned into a private aerodrome, which entered operation on 30 September 1962. The inauguration was attended by a Douglas DC-3 from Iberia, a military Junkers Ju 52, four T-5 aircraft from the Gando Air Base in Gran Canaria, and six planes from Aeroclub de Tenerife. The aerodrome was used both for planes and balloons. The first balloon departure was the 'Pequino Mundo' in 1964. Although a private aerodrome, it was available for emergencies, for example from the airforce or commercial aircraft. On 3 February 1963 the airfield was used to airlift people rescued from the collapse of the Granadilla City Hall, which had left 23 dead and over a hundred people were injured.

Tepper published in 1991 that won the 1992 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel. Summary Beauty, the daughter of the Duke of Westfaire, finds a letter from her mother, who mysteriously disappeared when Beauty was an infant, and learns of a curse that will occur on her upcoming sixteenth birthday. Using magical items that she constructs with thread left to her by her mother, Beauty evades the curse which instead falls on her half-sister. Beauty is abducted by a time-traveling crew that came to film the curse falling on the castle, and they take her to a dystopian future. The film crew and Beauty steal a time-machine and travel back to 1991. The camera operator, Jaybee, kills Bill, the scriptwriter, when Bill tries to protect Beauty, then Jaybee rapes Beauty. Beauty uses the magic boots she had made to work her way back to her own time, only to find the Black Death has struck the area in her absence. Disguised as a boy, she is taken in at Wellingford House as a stableboy. Beauty soon realizes that she is pregnant. She returns to Westfaire to alter her appearance, then returns to Wellingford House to lure one of the sons to marry her. She marries Ned and gives birth to a girl, but Beauty sees Jaybee in the infant Elly's eyes and feels revulsion toward the baby. Out riding one day, Beauty encounters Giles, who had been one of her father's men-at-arms and had been sent away by the family priest when he observed the growing affection between Beauty and Giles. Their romantic reunion goes awry when Beauty explains that she is married now. Distraught at losing Giles again and unhappy in her marriage, Beauty puts on her magic boots and tells the boots to take her to her mother. The boots take her to a land that she learns is called Chinanga. Traveling on the boat that rescues her, Beauty encounters Carabosse, the fairy who had laid the curse. Carabosse explains that she is trying to protect Beauty from the Dark Lord, the evil power. They encounter Beauty's mother, Elladine, who had been trapped in Chinanga. When a ceremony dissolves the imaginary land of Chinanga, Beauty, Elladine, and Carabosse travel to Ylles, the fairy land, where Beauty learns how to use her fairy powers. While there, Beauty helps Thomas the Rhymer escape. Carabosse tells Beauty that she has seen in the future that magic disappears, and that to preserve it, a seed was planted in Beauty for safekeeping. Beauty moves back and forth between her time, the future, Ylles, and the realm of the Dark Lord. She rediscovers Giles, meets her now-grown daughter, rescues her adolescent granddaughter, encounters her enchanted great-grandson, and takes vengeance on Jaybee. Horrified at how the future has destroyed magic and beauty and nature, she uses her fairy magic to save some of every type of bird and animal and fish and insect, every tree and flower and herb. Themes Beauty presents a narrative in which the world is doomed and Beauty's goal is preserving the world for the future. Tepper uses the Sleeping Beauty framework to explore issues of sexuality and ecology for Beauty herself and the impact of those issues on a global scale. Her dystopian future shows a world with no quality of life; global biodiversity has been sacrificed to feed an overpopulated world. Magic and beauty are lost as time and technology progress. Robert Collins, writing in the Journal of the Fantastic in the Arts, characterizes the novel as ecofeminism, with Beauty as an icon of the green movement. Through the eyes of Beauty, the medieval past is positioned as a vision of natural beauty and contrasted to an \\"apocalyptic ugliness\\" of a world degraded and destroyed by \\"rampant humanity\\". Tepper's ecological theme is expressed through Beauty's description of the conceptual \\"gobble-god\\": Tepper weaves multiple fairy tale narratives into the plot: Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Snow White, The Frog Prince and Tam Lin. Starting out as the heroine, Beauty transitions into the roles of fairy godmother and then to ancient grandmother, and recognizes the roles of her descendents as parts of fairy tales from her time in the future. The idealistic nature of fairy tales is contrasted with the realistic form of love that Beauty and Giles find in their old age. Reception Beauty won the 1992 Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel, and was nominated for the Mythopoeic Fantasy Award for Adult Literature. It was a preliminary nominee for the 1992 Hugo Award for Best Novel. Lauren Lacey says of Tepper's Beauty: \\"her focus on bringing the tales together rather than on encouraging the proliferation of their possibilities leads to a damaging sense of narrative closure.\\" A review in The Kingston Whig-Standard says Tepper \\"takes the two-dimensional, symbolic characters of a fairy tale and makes them real by giving both them and their stories depth and historical detail.\\" Kirkus Reviews is generally negative, saying \\"Tepper can't decide whether to warn against a gathering spiritual darkness, lament the collapse of an aesthetic ideal, or thunder against global eco-disaster.\\" References Category:1991 American novels Category:Environmental fiction books Category:Feminist science fiction novels Category:American post-apocalyptic novels Category:Dystopian novels Category:1991 fantasy novels ","title":"Beauty (Tepper novel)"},{"id":"65364239","text":"Tihomir Todorov (born 20 December 1969) is a retired Bulgarian football goalkeeper.

Nothing much of Rainier 's early life is known. He is described as coming from the castle called Castrum Vetus (Old Castle) in the county of Todi in the papal document confirming his consecration as patriarch. He probably received a formal education, most likely in law. He is described by Pope Honorius III as a \\"man of knowledge\\" (virum scientia) and a document of 1215 may indicate that he had a university degree. Before becoming vice-chancellor, Rainier was the prior of the basilica of San Frediano in Lucca, a community of canons regular. He may have been a canon regular himself, but more likely the posting was a sinecure. He probably served in the Roman chancery for some time before his appointment as vice- chancellor. Possibly he met the future Honorius III when the latter was vice- chancellor in 1194–1197. He became vice-chancellor in 1216 shortly after Honorius III's election as pope. A document of 1215 refers to a Master Rainier as apostolic notary, which may be the future patriarch. Rainier was consecrated patriarch of Antioch in November 1219. He replaced Peter of Capua, Honorius' previous nominee, who was being promoted to a cardinalate. The pope informed the Antiochene chapter of the change in a letter of December. At Antioch, Rainier quarrelled with Prince Bohemond IV, who was confiscating church properties to make up shortfalls of cash. Himself short of money, Rainier attempted to reignite Antioch's claim to the archdiocese of Tyre, which responded by claiming jurisdiction over the church in the County of Tripoli, which was under Antiochene control. Honorius quashed both claim and counterclaim as unprofitable when most of the territory in question was not even in Christian hands. Rainier's pontificate saw the reopening of the schism between Latins and Orthodox in the church of Antioch. This was the result of a broken marriage alliance between Antioch and Cilician Armenia. Bohemond IV's son Philip had been married to Queen Isabella, but in 1224 he was imprisoned by Constantine of Baberon and the following year he died. Latin churchmen were expelled from Cilician Armenia, and Orthodox refused to recognize the Latin patriarch. At some point Rainier was joined in Antioch by his nephew, Philip, who had probably served under him in the chancery. He experienced bouts of illness in Antioch, and credited Philip for taking care of him. In 1225, he returned to Italy, leaving Philip in control of the castle of Cursat, where the patriarchal treasury was kept. He died while in Italy, for his death on 16 September is mentioned by Honorius in a letter dated 25 September and news could not have travelled so fast from Antioch to Rome.

The border is 1,845 km (1,146 m) in length, over half of which follows the Mekong River, and runs from the tripoint with Myanmar in the north to tripoint with Cambodia in the south. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with Myanmar at the confluence of the Kok and Mekong rivers, following the latter towards the south-east. It then leaves the river and proceeds overland in a broadly southwards direction over various hill ridges, down to the Hueang River. It then follows this river to the north-east up to the confluence with the Mekong, from where it follows the Mekong for the majority of the border's length. Just north-west of Pakse the border leaves the Mekong and then follows the ridge of the Dângrêk Mountains south the tripoint with Cambodia. History A pillar marking the border From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and the colony of French Indochina was created in 1887. The Lao kingdoms were at this point tributary states of the Kingdom of Siam (the old name for Thailand), however all areas east of the Mekong were annexed to French Indochina in 1893 following the Franco-Siamese War. In 1902 Siam was forced to cede areas west of the Mekong to France, encompassing the modern province of Sainyabuli and the western half of Champasak Province. More land was ceded in another treaty in 1904, and again in 1907. A minor treaty in 1926 cleared up the outstanding issue of sovereignty over islets in the Mekong. Following Japan’s invasion of French Indochina in 1940 the ceded areas west of the Mekong and south-western Laos were returned to Thailand, however this arrangement was annulled following Japan's defeat and the pre-war border reinstated. Laos obtained a partial independence from France in 1949, gaining complete independence in 1953, with the boundary then becoming one between two sovereign states. Thailand occasionally made claims on the territories ceded to Laos curing the colonial era, with tensions rising following the victory of the Communist Pathet Lao in the Laotian Civil War in 1975. Friendship treaties were signed in 1976 and 1979 in attempt to calm tensions, with both sides recognising the territorial integrity of the other.Brown, MacAlister, and Joseph J. Zasloff. \\"Relations with Thailand\\". Laos: a country study (Andrea Matles Savada, ed). Library of Congress Federal Research Division (July 1994) However fighting broke out in 1984 over disputed villages adjacent to the frontier in Sainyabuli Province/Uttaradit Province, and again in 1987–88 over a nearby area. A joint committee was established in 1991 which aimed to resolved the dispute peacefully, however discussions dragged on throughout the decade. A joint boundary commission was established in 1997, however its work was suspended in 1998 following the Asian financial crisis. As of 2018 border demarcation is still ongoing.

Overview  Anarchist bookfairs have existed since at least 1983. They are community-organized, held either annually or sporadically, and usually last between a day and a weekend. At these fairs, anarchist publishers sell literature from booths to an internal audience of other anarchists and anarchist publishers. They are also social events, as the distribution of publication brings those sympathetic to anarchism together to exchange ideas and organize according to their shared interest. Bookfairs are not intended to replace external political activism or fight capitalism, but serve as a space for anarchist activists to build networks and experience social togetherness.  Selected fairs  Anarchist book fair in the Balakans London has hosted annual anarchist bookfairs since 1983, first in Conway Hall and later in Park View School. Other British locales including Bradford, Bristol, Cardiff, Glasgow, and Manchester have hosted anarchist book fairs. The annual Bay Area Anarchist Bookfair began in 1995. Held in Golden Gate Park and organized by Bound Together, the fair includes West Coast alternative publishers and organizations such as Food Not Bombs. Speakers have included Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Carol Queen, artist Eric Drooker, activist Roxanne Dunbar-Ortiz, and publisher Bruce Anderson. The 2005 event had 75 vendors including AK Press, who had the largest booth. Los Angeles also hosts an anarchist bookfair. The Montreal Anarchist Book Fair () has occurred annually since at least 2009. It attracts anti-capitalists and activists including anarchoprimitivists, Marxists, queer groups, and skinheads.

It is a suspension feeder and catches food particles floating past with its branched feeding tentacles. Description Thyone roscovita has a cylindrical body up to long. The general colour is pinkish-grey or pinkish-brown, with scattered darker brown and opaque spots. The body has a thick cuticle, and is densely covered with yellowish, flat-topped tube feet. The anterior (front) end has a mouth surrounded by a ring of ten branching tentacles, and the plume of tentacles is often the only part of the animal visible, the body being buried in the sediment. The tentacular plume is up to long; the bases of the tentacles are thick and whitish, the secondary branches are black and needle-like, and these bear transparent wispy filaments that give a vaporous effect. Distribution and habitat Thyone roscovita is native to the northeastern Atlantic Ocean, the North Sea, the English Channel and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from the Shetland Isles and the coasts of Britain and Ireland to the Bay of Biscay and the western Mediterranean Sea. It is found semi-buried in the sediment on soft bottoms, such as gravel, shelly sand or mud, from the intertidal zone down to about . Less frequently, it tucks itself into a rock crevice, with just its tentacles projecting. Ecology Thyone roscovita unfurls its oral tentacles and uses them to catch organic particles floating past. The smallest branches have adhesive papillae to which the particles stick. The tentacles are retracted in a predetermined order to transfer any food caught to the mouth. The sexes are separate in this species. The gametes are liberated into the water column where fertilisation takes place. The barrel-shaped larvae have a short planktonic life before sinking to the seabed and undergoing metamorphosis into juvenile sea cucumbers.

History Various accounts are given regarding the origins of Mudhaykirah. According to Umara ibn Abi al-Hasan al-Yamani, the town was founded by a mawla of the Ziyadid dynasty in the ninth century; Baha al-Din al-Janadi, on the other hand, claims that it was built by a member of the Banu Manakh, who conquered the area during the reign of the Abbasid caliph al- Ma'mun (). In 905 Mudhaykhirah was captured by the Isma'ili missionary (da'i) Ali ibn al-Fadl al-Jayshani, who expelled and killed its Manakhi ruler in battle. The town subsequently served as the base of Ali's operations for the remainder of his career. A short time after Ibn al-Fadl's death in 915, the town was besieged and taken by the Yu'firids and devastated in the process; al-Janadi, writing in the fourteenth century, remarked that it remained in a ruined state from that point until his own time.

Parit was first arrested in mid-August and then released on bail, and is currently facing 18 charges, from violating cleanliness laws to sedition.  High-school student activism  Parit first came to media attention in 2015 at the age of 16, when he was General Secretary of the Education for Liberation of Siam (ELS) group, a progressive student group campaigning for education reform, by campaigning for maintaining access to education in the face of a junta proposal to reduce the number of free years of education. As a student at Bangkok's prestigious Triam Udom Suksa School, he displayed a banner before Thai junta leader General Prayut Chan-o-cha asking how Thai children could avoid corruption. In 2016, he was lauded for advocating against the 2016 junta-sponsored draft Thai Constitution on the grounds that it could remove 15 years of free education. He was threatened with the 2007 Computer Crime Act for performing in a music video against draft constitution. Parit also campaigned against the SOTUS system (Seniority, Order, Tradition, Unity, and Spirit), a set of hierarchical normative values for Thailand's tertiary education institutions that emphasizes seniority and hazing. In 2017, Parit was involved in an ELS satire of Thailand's National Children's Day.  University student activism  In February 2019, Parit demonstrated against Thai general Apirat Kongsompong's decision to broadcast the controversial Cold War military anthem ‘Nak Phaen Din’ (‘Scum of the Earth’) on the grounds that the song incited hatred and was charged with violating the 2015 Public Assembly Act. In June 2020, Parit was involved in a small protest that involved tying white ribbons around Bangkok to highlight the forced disappearance of Thai activist Wanchalearm Satsaksit in Cambodia. He was subsequently charged under Section 12 of the 1992 Act on the Maintenance of the Cleanliness and Orderliness of the Country. On 8 June, the SUT, led by Parit as former president of the SUT and spokesperson Panusaya Sithijirawattanakul organized a small public protest at Pathumwan Police Station against the prolongation of the COVID-19-related Emergency Decree. On 24 June, Parit led a Student Union of Thailand protest, one of 15 such protests, to commemorate the 88th anniversary of the 1932 Siamese Revolution. The next month, Parit was involved in the “Free Youth” rally in Bangkok on the 18th, the largest Thai political protest since the 2014 military coup. On 12 August, Thammasat University Student Union mobilized student guards to prevent Parit and Panusaya from being arrested by the police in an event that gained significant attention on social media. Parit and others were arrested on 14 August on sedition and other charges related to his involvement in the July 18 protest, following which Human Rights Watch issued a statement calling on Thai authorities to immediately drop all charges and unconditionally release him and the other student protesters. He was released on bail the following day and subsequently became one of the leaders of the September protests.

The original relief in marble was completed by Duquesnoy in the early 17th century. The original Sleeping Silenus is known today only through copies. A well-preserved version in bronze is currently housed at Rubenshuis in Antwerp. Relief According to Bellori, the Silenus relief is \\"an invention according to the poetry of Virgil.\\" Virgil's fourth eclogue goes thusly: > In a cave, two boys > Chromis, and Mnasylos, Silenus found > Lying asleep, all swollen with the wine > Of yesterday, as always he is seen. > His garlands lay beyond, fall'n from his head; > His heavy wine-jar from worn handle hung: > They seize him (for he oft had promised fair > To sing them songs) and bind, with his own wreaths > Now comes the fairest of the Naiads near, > Ægle, encouraging the coward boys, > And, as he opes his eyes, she with the juice > Of mulberries, stains his brows and temples red. In the relief, Silenus is leaning against a vitis, sleeping off his intoxication. Some putti are tying him up with shoots, while a nymph, Aegle, is smearing his face with mulberries. To the right, there are satyrs prodding Silenus' donkey, opening its mouth to make it stand up. The version housed at the Rubenshuis was cast in bronze, with an expensive background in lapis lazuli.

There are approximately 100 graves on the site, including the gravesite of Reverend J. P. Thompson, the first pastor of the St. David AME Zion Church. Early history The Eastville community, a mixed diaspora of Irish, Native American and African-American workers, was first developed in the 1830s during the boom times of Sag Harbor whaling.https://www.google.com/books/edition/Sag_Harbor_Is/J3isYF4ziXEC?hl=en&gbpv;=1&dq;=%22the%20soul%20of%20summer%22%20%20%22Paul%20Ruffins%22&pg;=PA73&printsec;=frontcover&bsq;=%22the%20soul%20of%20summer%22%20%20%22Paul%20Ruffins%22 Previously Snooksville, after the Irish Snooks-Hicks family, it became Eastville due to being east of the village. The AME church, built in 1839 by African Americans and Native Americans on Eastville Avenue and believed to have housed a stop on the Underground Railroad, is still standing in its original location. The founder, Rev. J. P. Thompson, was an abolitionist and confidante of orator Frederick Douglass. The Eastville Community Historical Society of Sag Harbor (founded 1981)https://www.eastvillehistorical.org/ also owns, maintains and preserves the adjacent century-old cemetery in which African and Native Americans of the post-colonial St. David's church membership are buried, of whom many were Sag Harbor whalers. Also prominent in the community were many Quakers who were sympathetic to the abolitionist cause. In 1857, trustees Elymus Derby, Samuel Butler and David Hempstead of the AME Zion church purchased the land for a cemetery from Hannah and Anna Maria Solomon. It was used for burials until 1993. Archeological African American, Irish and Native American burial ground Beginning in the early 1800s until the mid 1900s, the portion of the historic Sag Harbor district known as Eastville was home to a multi-ethnic population of free Blacks, European immigrants and Native Americans. The area had evolved due to a series of economic changes. There were two village fires, the rise and subsequent downfall of the whaling industry, the development of a factory industry, and the current boom in the tourism and summer resort business. Today Eastville retains its ethnic diversity, with some flight of African-Americans and influx of new residential homebuilders, a change that threatens the summer cottages built during the 1950s for a overbuilt esthetic of mega-mansions more suited for the economies of scale to match the Hamptons chic. In 2014 a historic marker was unveiled at the site of the cemetery, where students from the University of Minnesota used ground-penetrating radar and mapping to survey the cemetery on Eastville Avenue. The funds to conduct the surveys were awarded to the Eastville Community Historical Society (ECHS)https://www.sagharborpartnership.org/eastville-community-unique- diversity.html by The Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) in 2013. The ECHS used the grant to support the preservation and community stewardship of the AME Cemetery, a heritage site that represented the working class community of African American, Irish immigrant and Native American residents in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The funds for the historic marker came from a grant from The William G. Pomerory Foundation,https://www.wgpfoundation.org/ also the Huntington Arts Councilhttps://www.huntingtonarts.org/ and the Archeological Institute of America.https://www.archaeological.org/ Heritage House Eastville community in Sag Harbor A 1925 house originally bought through a Sears & Roebuck catalog, Heritage House became the headquarters of the Eastville Community Historical Society at 139 Hampton Street in 1996, and today administers the affairs of the AME Cemetery. Since 1985 the society has kept the preservation of the Eastville community foremost, and was also instrumental in getting recognition of the adjacent Sag Harbor Hills, Azurest, and Ninevah Beach Subdivisions Historic District designation by the National Park Service.

All the Muslims of Tbilisi at the time were buried in this cemetery. In the 20th century, the cemetery was demolished. Azerbaijani professor Vagif Arzumanly visited the site in 1959 and found the half-destroyed grave of Mirza Shafi Vazeh, as well as multiple graves of children. In 1964–1965, the relatives of the people buried in the cemetery were informed that a botanical garden was to be built in location of the former cemetery. After this, Arzumanly visited the site again with Georgian professor Ivan Yenikolopov. They found and took pictures of around 100 graves. Only a handful of graves of well-known Azerbaijanis have survived, with the oldest one belonging to Mirza Shafi Vazeh, who died in 1852. In 1996, the grave of Mirza Fatali Akhundov was laid to rest in the cemetery. The event was attended by Azerbaijani president Heydar Aliyev in his first diplomatic trip to Georgia.

The border is 2,161 km (1,343 m) in length and runs from the tripoint with China in the north to tripoint with Cambodia in the south. Description The border starts in the north at the tripoint with China and proceeds overland in a south-eastwards direction. It then turns to the west, briefly utilising the Nam Sam River, before turning sharply south-eastwards and following the Annamite Mountains and, for a period, the Sepon River, terminating at the Cambodian tripoint. History A border marker at Nậm Xôi Historically the Annamite range formed a natural boundary between Vietnamese kingdoms in the east and Lao, Thai and Khmer kingdoms in the west. From the 1860s France began establishing a presence in the region, initially in modern Cambodia and Vietnam, and the colony of French Indochina was created in 1887. Laos was at this point part of the Kingdom of Siam (the old name for Thailand), however it was annexed to French Indochina in 1893 following the Franco-Siamese War. The precise date of the delimitation of the frontier is unclear; the International Boundary Study states that \\"The juridical basis of the Laos–Viet-Nam boundary probably stems from ancient treaties and custom as modified or made more specific by decrees of the Indochinese administration.\\" Part of the border was demarcated in 1916 following a dispute, and French maps were drawn up during the colonial period that were used as the basis for the later international border. Laos obtained a partial independence from France in 1949, gaining complete independence in 1953, followed by Vietnam in 1954. Vietnam washowever partitioned into North and South Vietnam separated by a Vietnamese Demilitarized Zone, with Laos bordering both entities. During the Vietnam War the border was crossed by Viet Cong supply lines, most notably the Ho Chi Minh Trail, causing it to be heavily bombed by American forces. Following the victory of the Communists in 1975 in both Vietnam and Laos, a border treaty was signed in 1976 based on the colonial-era border line. On the ground demarcation then took place from 1979–84. Some small modification of the border were made in 1986. Border crossings A border crossing at Nam Phao There are several border crossings: * Sop Hun (Laos) – Tay Trang (Vietnam) * Na Maew (Laos) – Nậm Xôi (Vietnam) * Nam Can (Laos) – Nam Khan (Vietnam) * Nam Phao (Laos) – Cau Treo (Vietnam) * Dansavanh (Laos) – Lao Bảo (Vietnam) * Bo Y (Laos) – Ngoc Hoi (Vietnam) * Cha Lo (Laos) – Napao (Vietnam) See also * Laos–Vietnam relations References border Category:Borders of Vietnam Category:Borders of Laos Category:International borders ","title":"Laos–Vietnam border"},{"id":"65364834","title":"Without You (Luke Combs song)"},{"id":"65364839","text":"Bianca Druță (born 6 March 2001) is a Moldovan futsal player and a footballer who plays as a midfielder for Women's Championship club Agarista-ȘS Anenii Noi and the Moldova women's national team.

It is part of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Manchester. The church is located at 189 North Main Street in Rochester.  History  =19th century= In the early 1880s, the \\"Societe Saint Jean-Baptiste\\" (founded October 22, 1879) began a campaign to secure the services of a resident, French-speaking priest for the 60-plus French-Canadian families of the area. In 1883, Bishop James A. Healy of the Portland Diocese appointed Rev. Urbain Lamy as the first pastor of \\"Notre Dame Du Tres Saint Rosaire\\" (Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary). The first Sunday Mass was celebrated in the McDuffee Block on March 22, 1883. A Bridge Street site was chosen for the church building, and construction was completed in time for Christmas Day Mass. Father Lamy guided the parish in purchasing land for the cemetery, in building the first school in 1888, and in building the first rectory in 1893. =20th century= Rev. Cyrille Joseph Paradis, pastor from 1900 to 1908, organized the \\"Societe des Dames de Ste-Anne\\", a social service group that is still active. In 1913, Rev. Charles Salyme Lacroix founded St. Charles Orphanage at the junction of South Main Street and Grant Street. The Grey Nuns of St. Hyacinthe first staffed the home, which is now sponsored by New Hampshire Catholic Charities as the St. Charles Children's Home. In 1939, a new Holy Rosary Elementary School was constructed during the pastorate of Rev. Joseph Henri Cormier. Holy Rosary High School was built in 1957 under the direction of Rev. Andre Brunelle, pastor from 1950 to 1961. In 1961 Rev. Gilles Simard arrived in Rochester, and under his guidance the Holy Rosary Credit Union was established. In 1963 the rectory was moved to the renovated Snow property at 189 North Main Street, the current location. Within the year, new church plans were underway. The Most Reverend Ernest J. Primeau, Bishop of Manchester, officiated at the dedication of the new church facility at 189 North Main, on September 15, 1963. In accordance with the Second Vatican Council directives, the sanctuary was renovated in 1977. In 1981 the Babe Ruth Baseball League established Msgr. Gilles Simard Park on an unused parcel of cemetery land. Rev. Paul D. Montminy was assigned to Our Lady of the Holy Rosary in 1989. Under his leadership, the administrative offices adjoining the rectory were constructed in 1994, the Holy Rosary Cemetery was landscaped and enlarged in 1995, and a new parish center was built in the year 2000. =21st century= In July 2007, the Rev. Paul Gousse was assigned as pastor of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary and soon after established a perpetual adoration chapel. He continues to review and update the grounds and buildings, improving safety and esthetics for all. In September 2019, Fr. Adrian Frackowiak was assigned as the Parochial Vicar for Our Lady of the Holy Rosary and St. Leo Parish. It was his first priestly assignment; he hails from Poland.

Construction and service  Eckford Webb, son of Isaac Webb teamed up with George W. Bell, and created the Webb & Bell shipyard at Milton Street in Greenpoint, Brooklyn. The shipyard launched the 96-ton pilot-boat Isaac Webb, for the New York and Sandy Hook pilots on October 31, 1860. Captain Augustus Van Pelt was in command of the boat. In 1860, the Isaac Webb, No. 8, was one of only twenty-one New York pilot boats in the Sandy Hook fleet. The Isaac Webb is listed in the Index to Ship Registers from 1861-1879 with Captain Augustus Van Pelt and Captain Freeman as masters of the boat. The N. Y. Pilots were listed as the owner. On August 5, 1867, Henry Seguine from the pilot-boat Isaac Webb, No. 8, wrote a letter of thanks to the American Seamen's Friend Society, for use of a library that was placed on board the vessel for the benefit of the crew. Rescues On October 14, 1871, the pilot-boat Isaac Webb, while cruising discovered the British brig Wexford in distress. She towed the brig for nine days and brought her into the New York harbor. She was promised $2,500 for the services for towing the brig to port safely. The amount was contested and a settlement was reached for $1,000. The Webb rescued the crew of the whaling bark Sarah, of New Bedford, Massachusetts, on October 16, 1878, forty miles south of Block Island with three survivors. Twenty-two of the crew perished. The Sarah had been caught up in a hurricane and was laying on its side, a floating wreck. The Web transferred the survivors to the F. S. Negus, No. 1 that carried them to Stonington, Connecticut. The Board of Pilot Commissioners of New York, voted to give a reward of $150.00 to the pilot-boat Isaac Webb for saving the three sailors from the wreck of the bark Sarah. Last voyage  On July 23, 1879, the pilot-boat Isaac Webb, No. 8 was reported as being on a cruise with Captain Van Pelt on board. In late July 27, the Webb went ashore in a dense fog at Quonochontaug Beach, Long Island. The Coast Wrecking Company was sent to assist her. She was shipwrecked and was a total loss.

His most successful recordings were made in collaboration with the klezmer bandleader and composer Abe Schwartz. Biography Little has been written about Moskowitz's early life, although he was apparently born outside of Bucharest, Romania on December 17, 1883. He is thought to have emigrated to the United States in 1913. Before long, he had signed on to Columbia Records as a recording artist. His collaboration with fellow Columbia artist Abe Schwartz saw their first success in 1919, when he recorded Schwartz's Dos Zekele mit Koilen. In 1922 Moskowitz was one of the first to record the hit Yiddish song Di Grine Kuzine, another piece Schwartz had written or at least copyrighted; other recordings of the song were soon made by Joseph Feldman, Morris Goldstein and others. Moskowitz continued to record Yiddish folk and comic songs for Columbia, and to a lesser degree Pathé Records and Okeh Records, in the early 1920s. After that, his pace of recording slowed and essentially ended by the late 1920s. In 1927, he did record with a fellow Romanian Jewish immigrant, the cymbalist Joseph Moskowitz, in what may be the only recording from that era of a Yiddish singer accompanied by a concert cimbalom. Moskowitz died in October 1963 in New York City at age 80. In the 1990s and 2000s, there was some renewed interest in Moskowitz's recordings, and they started to appear on a number of reissue CDs, such as Yiddish : New York-Paris-Varsovie 1910-1940 (1994), From Avenue A to the Great White Way (2002) and Cantors, klezmorim, and crooners, 1905-1953 : classic Yiddish 78s from the Mayrent Collection (2009).

The Department of Public Safety is responsible for state law enforcement, emergency management, crime information, crime support, and fire safety. The Arkansas Department of Public Safety was created on 11 April 2019 through the Arkansas Transformation and Efficiencies Act of 2019 Act 910 of 2019 . The Arkansas Department of Public Safety is an executive agency that reports directly to the Governor of Arkansas. Arkansas Code Title 25, Chapter 43 added an additional Subchapter 14 that specifies the creation of the Department of Public Safety. Approximately 17 state entities were transferred to the Department of Public Safety. The Department of Public Safety is responsible for state law enforcement, emergency management, crime information, crime support, and fire safety. The Department of Public Safety is headquartered at One State Police Plaza Drive in Little Rock, Arkansas. __TOC__ History The Arkansas Transformation and Efficiencies Act of 2019 is considered a signature piece of legislation under Governor Asa Hutchinson Act 910 of 2019 . Prior to the Act 910 of 2019, the State of Arkansas had 42 cabinet-level agencies reporting directly to the Governor of Arkansas. Act 910 of 2019 reduced the number or cabinet-level agencies to 15, including the Department of Public Safety. This change is considered the largest reorganization in Arkansas State Government in the past 50 years. The Secretary of the Arkansas Department of Public Safety is the executive head of the department, appointed by the Governor, is subject to confirmation by the Arkansas Senate, and serves at the pleasure of the Governor. Each board and division of the Arkansas Department of Public Safety is under the direction, control, and supervision of the Secretary of the Department.

This has particularly been true with regard to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. Trump and his appointees have pressured federal health and science agencies to take particular actions that Trump favors and to support his public pronouncements. He has sometimes claimed that there is a \\"deep state\\" conspiracy among federal scientists, whose members delay approval of vaccines and treatments because they want to hurt him politically or prevent his re- election. Background President Donald Trump, inaugurated on January 20, 2017, did not name a Science Advisor to the President until July 2018, when he appointed meteorologist Kelvin Droegemeier to the position. Science advisory committees at multiple agencies including the Department of the Interior, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the Food and Drug Administration have been disbanded. Many of Trump's first cabinet picks were people with a history of opposition to the agency they were named to head, including Rick Perry as Secretary of Energy, Betsey DeVos as Secretary of Education and Ben Carson as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. In the science area the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Scott Pruitt, had repeatedly sued the EPA when he was Oklahoma attorney general, and described himself as a \\"leading advocate against the EPA’s activist agenda\\". Health agencies =Suppressing and altering communications from health agencies= In April 2020, political strategist and lobbyist Michael Caputo was appointed by the White House as assistant secretary for public affairs of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in control of the department's communications strategy. He appointed Paul Alexander, a Ph.D. health researcher, as his top advisor. They and other HHS officials attempted to control the content of information coming from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) whenever it was deemed to contradict or undermine what Trump was saying publicly. In June 2020 the White House installed two political operatives with no public-health background at the CDC's Atlanta headquarters. Their responsibilities, according to CDC and administration officials, were to monitor CDC scientists and CDC Director Robert Redfield, as part of the ongoing effort to control the organization's public messaging. At first their role at CDC was undefined; one was later named Redfield's acting chief of staff and the other as her deputy. Although officially reporting to Redfield, they communicated regularly with Caputo and Alexander at HHS. Caputo in June was trying to gain control of the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), a weekly publication issued by the CDC; it is the CDC's main vehicle for imparting current information and recommendations about public health to physicians, researchers, and the general public. In September 2020 it was reported that political appointees at HHS had tried repeatedly to change, delay, or remove reports about COVID-19 from MMWR if they undermined Trump's claims that the outbreak was under control. Caputo confirmed the September report, saying that attempts to influence the content of MMWR had been going on for 3 1/2 months. He said it was because the MMWR reporting contained \\"political content\\" as well as scientific information, adding that the changes suggested by his office were \\"infrequently\\" accepted by CDC. A MMWR report downplaying the benefit of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment was delayed for almost a month as Alexander questioned the political leanings of the authors. A report on the susceptibility of schoolchildren to the virus was also held up. Alexander demanded, unsuccessfully, that he be allowed to review and edit all issues of MMWR before they were published. On August 8, Alexander wrote to Redfield saying that \\"CDC to me appears to be writing hit pieces on the administration\\". He asked Redfield to change some reports that had already been published. Alexander later said that the CDC had written \\"pseudoscientific reports\\" and that he was in a better position to \\"make the judgment whether this is crap\\". CDC resisted many of the changes, but increasingly allowed HHS personnel to review articles and suggest changes before publication. In August and early September 2020, Alexander sent several messages to press officers at the NIH attempting to direct Anthony Fauci's media comments. Among his demands were that Fauci should refrain from promoting the wearing of masks by children in school and COVID-19 testing of children. Fauci later said that he had not received the messages and would not have been influenced by them if he had. On September 16 Robert Redfield, head of the CDC, told a Senate hearing that HHS and the White House Office of Management and Budget had ordered him to transfer $300 million from his agency's budget to HHS, to be spent on a public relations campaign directed by Caputo. He added that CDC had not been consulted about the proposed public relations campaign, which was intended to \\"bring America back\\". Caputo stated on Facebook that the program \\"was demanded of me by the president of the United States, personally.\\" The goal was to get at least 20 celebrities to record messages to \\"restore hope\\" and \\"defeat despair\\" that would be broadcast before the November election. However, weeks before the election the program was reported to be \\"sputtering,\\" because most of the targeted celebrities refused to participate and because the video firm hired to carry out the project, headed by a business partner of Caputo, had no prior experience with public health campaigns. HHS Secretary Alex Azar told Congress that he had begun a review of the program to ensure that it would serve a public health purpose. In emails to Redfield, Alexander and Caputo repeatedly accused CDC scientists of attempting to \\"hurt the president\\" and writing \\"hit pieces on the administration\\". CDC employees described the period as a five-month-long campaign of bullying and intimidation. On June 30 Alexander strongly criticized an interview by Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director of the CDC, in which she described the extent of the pandemic and urged Americans to wear masks. Alexander accused her of lying and attempting to embarrass the president, and may have tried to get her fired. In another incident, Caputo repeatedly demanded to know who in the CDC press office had approved a series of interviews between a CDC epidemiologist and NPR, saying that he needed to manage department communications and \\"If you disobey my directions, you will be held accountable\\". He similarly threatened a CDC press official who had told CNN about an upcoming vaccine public relations campaign. On June 20, 2020, Alexander sent a message to CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, criticizing a CDC report about risks to pregnant women from COVID-19. Alexander said that the report, whose limitations the CDC had acknowledged, would \\"frighten women\\" and give the impression that \\"the President and his administration can't fix this and it is getting worse\\". He said that in his \\"opinion and sense\\" the CDC was \\"undermining the president by what they put out\\". After the political influence over the CDC was reported, Caputo took a 60-day medical leave of absence and Alexander was fired. In an interview with the Toronto Globe and Mail after his departure from HHS, Alexander defended his actions, stating that he had wanted the CDC to make their reports \\"more upbeat so that people would feel more confident going out and spending money\\", and that he \\"did not think agencies should contradict any president's policy\\". =U.S. federal government response to the COVID-19 pandemic= COVID-19 testing At a campaign rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on June 20, 2020, Trump claimed he had instructed his administration to slow down coronavirus testing in order to keep the number of confirmed cases down. On August 24, 2020 the testing guidelines on the CDC web page were quietly changed from their earlier recommendation that testing is recommended for anyone who has come into contact with someone who has COVID-19; the new message said that such people do not need to be tested if they do not have symptoms. Multiple public health experts expressed alarm at the new guideline, because people can be contagious even if they have no symptoms, and early testing of exposed people is considered essential to track and suppress the spread of the virus. On September 17 it was reported that the new guidelines had been written by the White House coronavirus task force, and been \\"dropped into\\" the CDC website by officials in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) without the knowledge of, or over the objections of, CDC scientists. A July document on \\"The importance of reopening schools\\" was also placed on the CDC website by HHS rather than CDC scientists. Two former directors of the CDC said that the notion of political appointees or non-scientists posting information to the CDC website is \\"absolutely chilling\\" and undermines the credibility of the institution. On September 18, the day after the manipulation of the CDC by political appointees was reported, the testing guideline was revised to its original recommendation, stressing that anyone who has been in contact with an infected person should be tested. Treatments for COVID-19 In early March, President Trump directed the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to test certain medications to discover if they had the potential to treat COVID-19 patients. Among those were chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine, which have been successfully used to treat malaria for over fifty years. On March 28, the FDA issued an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) which allowed certain hospitalized COVID-19 patients to be treated with hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine. On June 15, the FDA revoked the EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine as potential treatments for COVID-19. The FDA said the available evidence showed \\"no benefit for decreasing the likelihood of death or speeding recovery\\". On July 1, the FDA published a review of safety issues associated with the drugs, including fatal cardiac arrhythmias among other side effects. As of late July Trump was continuing to promote the use of hydroxychloroquine for COVID-19, despite the position of the NIH that the drug was \\"very unlikely to be beneficial to hospitalized patients with COVID-19\\". In August Trump pushed to get speedy approval of convalescent plasma as a COVID-19 treatment, because he wanted to be able to announce it as a treatment breakthrough at the August 2020 Republican National Convention. A week before the convention he claimed in a tweet that people within the FDA were deliberately delaying approval of treatments and vaccines in order to hurt his chances of re-election; he tagged FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn in the tweet. The National Institutes of Health (NIH) had concerns about the effectiveness of the treatment. On the Wednesday before the convention Trump phoned Francis S. Collins, head of the NIH, and ordered him to \\"get it done by Friday.\\" On the eve of the convention the NIH still had concerns, but Trump announced that the FDA had given emergency authorization for plasma therapy to be more widely used. In his announcement he greatly exaggerated the effectiveness of the treatment, calling it a major breakthrough and suggesting it might save the lives of 35% of coronavirus patients. The FDA approval had been much more limited in its scope and application, but Hahn initially echoed the president's claims, for which he apologized the next day. Mask wearing In September the CDC drafted an order that would require passengers and employees to wear masks on all forms of public and commercial transportation in the United States, including airplanes, trains, buses, subways, and transit hubs. Transportation unions had requested a federal mandate for mask wearing, citing the difficulty of working under a patchwork of rules. HHS Secretary Azar and CDC Director Redfield strongly supported the order. However, the White House's coronavirus task force, which is supposed to sign off on all coronavirus actions, rejected the order, saying that such orders should be left up to states and local governments. Advice on reopening The CDC intended to release on May 1 a 17-page report called Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework, with detailed guidelines for the reopening of businesses, public transit, restaurants, religious organizations, schools, and other public places which had been ordered closed during the pandemic. However, the Trump administration shelved the document; CDC staffers were told the recommendations \\"would never see the light of day.\\" An unauthorized copy was published by the Associated Press in late April. Six flowcharts were ultimately published on May 15, and a sixty-page set of guidelines was released without comment on May 20, weeks after many states had already opened up from lockdowns. In July 2020, as President Trump pushed publicly for all schools to reopen fully, a CDC report on the subject came under pressure from the White House, the White House coronavirus task force, and the office of the Vice President. Officials including Deborah Birx of the task force and Olivia Troye of Pence's staff pressed for the report to play down any risks involved in in-person schooling, and to stress the need for children to be in school for mental-health reasons. When the report, intended to guide parents by giving them a basis for decision making, was ready for distribution on July 23, it was distributed to multiple White House officials who were allowed to make edits. Among other things, a claim was inserted that the coronavirus was less deadly to children than seasonal flu—a claim which CDC scientists had objected to earlier in the week. The title of the final document was The Importance of Reopening America’s Schools this Fall. On September 29, the White House coronavirus task force overruled the CDC's recommendation regarding when passenger cruise ships should be allowed to resume sailing. The existing \\"no-sail\\" directive was scheduled to expire on September 30. CDC Director Redfield wanted to extend it to mid-February 2021. The task force instead agreed with the cruise ship industry's recommendation that the prohibition end on October 31, 2020. In August 2020 Trump announced the appointment of radiologist Scott Atlas as a White House advisor on the coronavirus. Atlas opposes closure of schools and businesses, saying the best approach is to promote \\"population immunity\\" by letting younger people get the virus while protecting the most vulnerable. He doubts the effectiveness of face masks to combat spread of the virus. He claims that children have a very low risk of death or serious illness and \\"almost never transmit the disease\\". Atlas quickly became influential within the administration; Trump welcomed his recommendations, which are in accord with Trump's own preferences, and reduced the role of other advisors such as Birx and Fauci. On October 5 HHS Secretary Azar met with three epidemiologists who promote the Great Barrington Declaration, a petition calling for an end to lockdown policies, instead protecting the most vulnerable in the population while allowing the virus to spread uncontrolled among healthy people while they live normal lives. Atlas attended the meeting and later said that he supports this approach. Other epidemiologists say this approach is dangerous because \\"If you do this, you’ll get more infections, more hospitalizations and more deaths.\\" The World Health Organization and most experts prefer to prevent infection through practices like hygiene, masks, and social distancing. Azar earlier told Congress that \\"herd immunity is not the strategy of the U.S. government\\". After the meeting he tweeted that he had met with the group to obtain \\"diverse scientific perspectives\\", adding that \\"We heard strong reinforcement of the Trump Administration’s strategy of aggressively protecting the vulnerable while opening schools and the workplace.\\" Vaccine development Trump has stressed the need for a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, and said one is being developed at \\"warp speed\\" (see Operation Warp Speed). He has repeatedly suggested that a COVID-19 vaccine will be available before the end of 2020, possibly before the November 3 election. His chief of staff Mark Meadows predicted a vaccine would be available by the end of October. When federal scientists including CDC Director Robert Redfield, Operation Warp Speed chief scientist Moncef Slaoui, and director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Anthony Fauci said that prediction is unlikely, given the time frame needed for clinical trials, Trump dismissed or contradicted their comments. When Redfield told a congressional committee that wearing a mask could be more effective in halting the spread of the disease than a vaccine, and that a vaccine would not be generally available to the public until the second or third quarter of 2021, Trump said that Redfield had \\"made a mistake\\" and that his vaccine prediction was \\"just incorrect information.\\" Republican allies of the president endorsed Trump's comments; House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said \\"If I just take the words of the CDC and the president, the president is right.\\" On September 21 Trump predicted a vaccine would be available \\"within a matter of weeks\\". The next day Fauci said it is impossible to know when a vaccine will be available, because \\"no one's seen the data\\"; the clinical trials are still \\"blinded\\" so that no one knows how the test groups and control groups compare to each other. Fauci has previously said that the efficacy of a vaccine might first become known in November or December. In late September the FDA said it planned to announce additional criteria for emergency approval of a vaccine. To ensure that the vaccine is safe and effective, the clinical trial reportedly must follow trial participants for at least two months after their second shot, and the placebo group must show at least five severe cases of COVID-19 and some cases in older people. The agency wanted to make its criteria public to bolster public trust in the process, as polling showed nearly half of the public would reject any vaccine they regard as rushed and politically tainted. At a press conference the next day, Trump said that the White House “may or may not” approve the new guidelines, saying it “sounds like a political move”. The White House blocked action on the guidelines for several weeks, objecting to a two-month-followup provision which would make it highly unlikely that a vaccine could be approved by election day. However, the White House approved them on October 6 after the FDA unilaterally published them on its website. Trump complained about the White House approval, claiming that the stricter guidelines were a conspiracy against his re-election. Environmental agencies =Department of Agriculture= The Trump administration has marginalized the role of science at the U.S. Department of Agriculture and has seen the mass resignation of many career scientists. In July 2019 two agencies of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA)—the Economic Research Service (ERS) and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture—were directed to move from the USDA's headquarters in Washington, D.C. to the Kansas City metropolitan area. Two- thirds of the USDA employees reassigned chose to quit rather than accept relocation.Ben Guarino, Many USDA workers to quit as research agencies move to Kansas City: 'The brain drain we all feared', The Washington Post (July 18, 2019). Current and former employees of the ERS were strongly critical of the relocation to Kansas City and other Trump administration policies, and the exodus of scientific and economic talent and disruption to federal research (especially on climate change and food security) that they had caused.Emily Moon, 'Cut, Relocate, Eviscerate': Moving a USDA Research Agency Will Have Lasting Consequences, Employees Say, Pacific Standard (July 18, 2019). The move to Kansas City area resulted in an attrition rate particularly high in the Resource and Rural Economics Division (90%) and in the Food Economics Division (up to 89%).Liz Crampton, ERS union predicts mass exodus ahead of relocation, Politico (June 25, 2019). ERS economists said that the Trump administration's moves were retaliation against the agency for publishing research reports detailing the negative economic effects of Trump's policies, including tariffs and Republican tax legislation, on U.S. agriculture.Ryan McCrimmon, Economists flee Agriculture Dept. after feeling punished under Trump, Politico (May 7, 2019). In April 2018, the office of Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue issued a directive to ERS and other research components of USDA, ordering them to include a disclaimer on peer-reviewed research in scientific journals stating that findings and conclusions were \\"preliminary\\" and \\"should not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.\\"Ben Guarino, USDA orders scientists to say published research is 'preliminary', The Washington Post (April 19, 2019). Susan Offutt, the ERS administrator under the Clinton and George W. Bush administrations, said that the requirement was contrary to the USDA's longstanding policy that permitted and encouraged federal scientists to publish work in journals. The \\"disclaimer\\" mandate was strongly criticized by USDA employees, science advocates, and scientific journal editors.Ben Guarino, After outcry, USDA will no longer require scientists to label research 'preliminary', The Washington Post (May 10, 2019). In May 2019, following an outcry, the USDA rescinded the directive. In April 2020 the Department of Agriculture established a Farmers to Families Food Box program, which pays farmers for food that would normally be destined for restaurants, repackages it into household quantities, and distributes it to food-insecure Americans. Starting in summer 2020, some of the boxes included a letter signed by Trump, recommending coronavirus precautions and concluding \\"Together we will overcome this challenge, and our Nation will emerge from this crisis stronger than ever before.\\" By September the Department was requiring all contracted distributors to include the letter in every box. Regarding the letters as election-related advertising, many food banks, schools, and other nonprofit agencies removed the letters before distributing the food, saying that they are forbidden by law from engaging in political activity. =Hurricane Dorian–Alabama controversy= On September 1, 2019, as Hurricane Dorian approached the U.S. mainland, Trump commented on Twitter about the hurricane and incorrectly mentioned Alabama as one of the states that was threatened by the approaching storm. In fact the forecast on September 1 was that Dorian would steer well away from Alabama, so that Trump apparently relied on information that was several days old. About 20 minutes after Trump's tweet, the Birmingham, Alabama office of the National Weather Service (NWS) issued a tweet that appeared to contradict Trump, saying that Alabama \\"will NOT see any impacts from Dorian\\". The Birmingham office was unaware of Trump’s tweet but was responding to a flood of phone calls and other questions about whether the storm was going to hit Alabama. Later that day and over the following days, as the hurricane moved up the coast and Alabama felt no effects from it, Trump insisted repeatedly that he had been right about the hurricane threatening the state. On September 4 at a briefing in the Oval Office he insisted that his Alabama comment had been correct, and displayed a forecast map dated August 29 which had been altered with a black marker to extend the cone of uncertainty of the hurricane's possible path into southern Alabama; the incident became known as Sharpiegate. On September 6, NOAA published an unsigned statement in support of Trump's initial claim, saying that NHC models \\"demonstrated that tropical-storm-force winds from Hurricane Dorian could impact Alabama.\\" The statement also said the message from the Birmingham NWS office had been incorrect because it \\"spoke in absolute terms that were inconsistent with probabilities from the best forecast products available at the time.\\" The statement was widely criticized as \\"political\\", \\"utterly disgusting and disingenuous\\", and with \\"no scientific basis\\". The Inspector General of the Department of Commerce investigated the memorandum, saying that it called into question \\"the NWS’s processes, scientific independence, and ability to communicate accurate and timely weather warnings and data to the nation in times of national emergency.\\" Her investigation confirmed that the September 6 statement had been issued by Commerce officials in response to direct orders from the White House. The report said that White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney instructed Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross to get NOAA to issue a statement supporting the president’s claims, and Mulvaney and Ross both approved the statement before it was issued. Another investigation reported that the acting NOAA administrator and his deputy chief of staff had also been involved with issuing the report. NOAA’s acting chief scientist said \\"If not the single highest person in NOAA, who will stand for the Scientific Integrity of the agency and the trust our public needs to invest in our scientific process and products?\\" The Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Environmental Observation and Prediction wrote in an email to another NOAA scientist, \\"you have no idea how hard I'm fighting to keep politics out of science.\\" =Environmental Protection Agency= In a May 2018 survey, the EPA inspector general's office found that nearly 400 science-related employees said they had experienced, but did not report, potential violations of the EPA’s scientific integrity policy. More than 250 employees said their concern was that a manager or senior leader had possibly interfered with science, and nearly 175 said they had experienced \\"suppression or delay of release of scientific report or information.\\" Commenters said they had observed \\"suppression, changes, manipulation, or exclusion of scientific information, results, or research.\\" They said senior leadership, particularly political appointees, often do not understand or adequately consider science in their decisions, and they expressed a belief that their leadership is \\"greatly influenced by political, industry, state, or regulated groups.\\" Climate change policy Before his election Trump promised to trim the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). At a Republican primary debate in Detroit on March 3, 2016 he said: \\"Department of Environmental Protection: We are going to get rid of it in almost every form. We’re going to have little tidbits left. But we’re going to take a tremendous amount out.\\" The head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, is a climate change denier. Under his leadership the EPA has focused on promoting fossil fuel energy and repealing regulations regarding clean air, clean water, and federal lands. Although in the scientific literature there is overwhelming scientific consensus that global surface temperatures have increased in recent decades and that the trend is caused by human-induced emissions of greenhouse gases, neither Trump nor any of the department heads he has appointed believe that global warming is human-related. Following Trump's election, large amounts of climate information from the EPA website was altered or removed. There was widespread concern among environmentalists and scientists, and a coalition of scientific and academic groups began to make copies of the EPA web pages before they were deleted. According to the Environmental Data & Governance Initiative which tracks changes to government websites under the Trump administration, over 200 web pages providing climate information were omitted during Trump's first year in office. Other pages were altered to remove mentions of climate and climate change. Wetlands and waterways In June 2017 Pruitt was preparing to undo the Waters of the United States rule, a regulation giving federal protection to wetlands and tributaries that flow into federally protected major waterways. An 87-page analysis had concluded that such protection would cost real estate developers and farmers between $236 million and $465 million, but would provide benefits of between $555 million and $572 million in reducing water pollution. Pruitt's deputies verbally ordered the analysts to produce a new study leaving out the quantifiable benefits. \\"They did what they were told\\", according to a 30-year administrator in the agency's water office. The administrator added that such analyses typically take months or years and are supported by research and a paper trail, but \\"This repeal process is political staff giving verbal directions to get the outcome they want, essentially overnight.\\" Trichloroethylene In February 2020 the EPA released a report on the toxicity of the industrial chemical trichloroethylene (TCE), establishing the benchmark for unsafe exposure levels. Instead of the benchmark established by the agency's scientists, namely an exposure level known to cause fetal heart abnormalities, their draft report produced after three years' work had been completely altered to establish a much less stringent benchmark. All references to \\"cardiac toxicity\\" were eliminated. The report that was eventually published established autoimmune disease as the endpoint—a criterion allowing nearly 500 times as much TCE exposure. The report had been rewritten at the urging of chemical industry lobbyists and on direct orders from the Executive Office of the President.  Other agencies  A supervisor at the Department of Energy told employees not to use the terms \\"climate change\\", \\"emissions reduction,\\" or \\"Paris Agreement\\" in any written communication. These were described as \\"hot button\\" terms better avoided, with the suggestion that it would be better to use words like \\"jobs\\" and \\"infrastructure\\". In March 2020 The New York Times reported that an official at the Department of the Interior has repeatedly inserted climate change denial language into the agency's scientific reports, such as those that affect water and mineral rights. The wording inserted into the documents includes assertions that there is a lack of consensus for global warming among scientists and that increased atmospheric carbon dioxide is beneficial. Responses and reactions =Congressional investigations= Democratic members of the House of Representatives have launched several investigations. The House Select Committee on the Coronavirus Crisis is investigating claims that political employees of the HHS have pressured scientists to alter data or change their recommendations related to the coronavirus pandemic. The lawmakers requested interviews with seven HHS employees. House Democrats are also investigating a planned advertising blitz by HHS to \\"defeat despair and inspire hope\\" about the pandemic. The stated goal is to \\"install confidence to return to work and restart the economy.\\" Democrats questioned whether the $250 million ad campaign has political motivations, noting that it was proposed and supervised by Caputo. They also asked where the money is coming from, and requested that the program's launch be delayed while their investigation is underway. =Employee complaints to EPA inspector general and scientific integrity office= Dozens of current and former employees of the EPA, Fish and Wildlife Service, and Army Corps of Engineers filed a complaint with the inspector general of the EPA regarding political interference during the repeal of the Waters of the United States rule. Senator Tom Carper has asked the EPA inspector general to investigate why only politically appointed attorneys and not career attorneys were listed as the attorneys of record on multiple court filings involving greenhouse gas emissions and water pollution. Inquiries, complaints, and requests for advice have \\"spiked\\" with the EPA's Scientific Integrity office. Reportedly they received about 20 inquiries per year from 2012 to 2016, but got more than 60 inquiries during the first three quarters of the 2019 fiscal year; about half of them related to political interference with scientific work. =Rick Bright whistleblowing= The House Energy and Commerce Committee heard testimony from Rick Bright, a career scientist who was removed from his position as director of the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority for warning about problems with the administration's response to the coronavirus. Bright had filed a whistleblower complaint with the Office of Special Counsel. In the complaint, Bright said that his ouster and demotion were illegal retaliation by the Trump administration due to his warnings about the virus, his opposition to political interference in decision-making, and his objections to the promotion of hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment without scientific evidence. The U.S. Office of Special Counsel determined that there were \\"reasonable grounds to believe\\" that the Trump administration's HHS had unlawfully retaliated against Bright, in violation of the Whistleblower Protection Act, \\"because he made protected disclosures in the best interest of the American public.\\" The office recommended that Bright be reinstated as head of BARDA while the investigation is undertaken. However, the recommendation was not binding on HHS, and was not honored by the agency. On October 6, 2020, Bright resigned from the government. In an addendum to his whistleblower complaint, Bright stated that, following his demotion, he had been given \\"no meaningful work\\" since September 4; that NIH officials had rejected his proposals for a national COVID-19 testing strategy \\"because of political considerations\\"; and that officials had ignored his request that he join the $10 billion Operation Warp Speed initiative to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. =National academy criticisms= On September 24 the presidents of the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Medicine issued a joint statement saying, \\"We find ongoing reports and incidents of the politicization of science, particularly the overriding of evidence and advice from public health officials and derision of government scientists, to be alarming. It undermines the credibility of public health agencies and the public’s confidence in them when we need it most.\\" The statement was issued the day after Trump suggested he might veto an FDA proposal to raise the standards for emergency approval of a coronavirus vaccine. They added, \\"Policymaking must be informed by the best available evidence without it being distorted, concealed, or otherwise deliberately miscommunicated.... Ending the pandemic will require decision- making that is not only based on science but also sufficiently transparent to ensure public trust in, and adherence to, sound public-health instructions. Any efforts to discredit the best science and scientists threaten the health and welfare of us all.\\" =Medical journal criticism= In October 2020 the New England Journal of Medicine, in an editorial signed by 34 editors, denounced the Trump administration's handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. The article marked the first time in the medical journal's 200-year history that it had condemned or supported any political candidate.Gina Kolata, In a First, New England Journal of Medicine Joins Never-Trumpers, The New York Times (October 7, 2020).Editorial: Dying in a Leadership Vacuum, New England Journal of Medicine (October 8, 2020). In the editorial, the journal strongly criticized the Trump administration's rejection of scientific expertise; its attempts to politicize and undermine the FDA, NIH, and CDC; and its decision \\"to ignore and even denigrate experts\\" within government institutions.

He is considered one of the most influential and celebrated contemporary Chinese poets. His poems have been said to \\"carry a sense of the world’s plentitude and of the world’s puzzlement.\\" In addition to his poetry, he has published two essay volumes, one book of criticism, a play, and translations of works by Pound, Borges, and Miłosz, and others. Xi Chuan was born in Xuzhou, Jiangsu province and raised in Beijing. He attended a foreign-languages school for diplomats, an unusual opportunity at a time when most schools were closed. At Beijing University, he wrote a senior thesis on Ezra Pound's translations of Chinese poetry, earning an English degree. That's when he adopted his pen name, Xi Chuan (meaning \\"West Stream\\"). After college, he worked as a magazine editor for Huangqiu (Globus) and launched Qingxiang (Tendency), an independent literary journal that ran from 1988 until it was shut down in 1992, after only 3 issues. From 1990 to 1995, he was one of the editors of the unofficial magazine Modern Han Poetry. He also acted in Jia Zhangke's 2000 underground film Platform. Xi gained recognition in the period following the Misty Poets in the late 1980s, in the early period of China's economic liberalization. In 1989, two of his closest friends, both poets who had attended Beijing University, passed away: Hai Zi committed suicide on March 26, aged twenty-five, and Luo Yihe died from cerebral hemorrhage, aged twenty-eight, on May 31. (In 1997, he published Hai Zi's works posthumously.) Following these deaths and the failure of the Tiananmen Square protests that year, he barely wrote for two years. This break took his poetry from \\"condensed, numinous lyricism\\" combining classical Chinese influences with Western modernism to \\"meditative, expansive prose poems that dismantled the aestheticism and musicality of his previous self\\". He teaches classical and modern Chinese literature at the Central Academy of Fine Arts and lives in Beijing, China. Before that, he had taught Western literature in Chinese translation and introductory English. He has held appointments at universities outside China like New York University and the University of Victoria. He was won prizes in China, Germany, and from UNESCO.

It is situated 300 feet northwest of the slightly higher Monster Tower. Washer Woman is so named because the feature gives the appearance of a washerwoman bent over a washtub. This geographical feature's name was officially adopted in 1986 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names after previously having similar names such as Washer-Woman Arch and The Washer Woman. Washer Woman and Monster Tower are an eroded fin composed of Wingate Sandstone, which is the remains of wind-borne sand dunes deposited approximately 200 million years ago in the Late Triassic. Airport Tower is set to the east, and Mesa Arch is situated to the west. A short hike to Mesa Arch provides the easiest view of Washer Woman. Access to this formation is via the four-wheel drive White Rim Road, which is the other option to see it. The top of this geological formation rises 1,300 feet above the road in approximately one mile. Precipitation runoff from Washer Woman drains southeast into the nearby Colorado River via Buck Canyon. Climbing The first ascent of Washer Woman was made by Maurice Horn, John Horn, and Pete Carmen on Apr 20, 1967, via the South Face.https://www.deserttowersbook.com/first-ascent-timeline. The first ascent of the classic In Search of Suds route on the West Face was made by Glenn Randall and Charlie Fowler in September 1982.Cameron M. Burns, Selected Climbs in the Desert Southwest Colorado First Edtion, The Mountaineers Books, 1999, page 107. Climate Spring and fall are the most favorable seasons to visit Washer Woman. According to the Köppen climate classification system, it is located in a Cold semi-arid climate zone, which is defined by the coldest month having an average mean temperature below −0 °C (32 °F) and at least 50% of the total annual precipitation being received during the spring and summer. This desert climate receives less than of annual rainfall, and snowfall is generally light during the winter.

Travelling first via Australia and New Zealand, Blekman arrived in Nagasaki in 1859, living among the foreign community in Nagasaki.Japan in Late Victorian London: The Japanese Native Village in Knightsbridge and The Mikado, 1885, Sainsbury Institute, 2009, pp 49–54, Blekman was hired first by the British Legation as a Dutch translator in 1861 for the Shimonoseki area and later to represent the French in talks with the second Japanese Ambassadorial European dispatch in 1864–1866, as Dutch was the language the Japanese used to negotiate treaties at this time. However Blekman caused financial strife between the French and Shogunal authorities by inflating the asking price for French warships to divert the excess payment to Blekman's trading company and was dismissed as their intermediary Dutch interpreter. With a warrant out for his arrest in Japan he fled to San Francisco and began anew, putting together his first entertainment troupe in 1867, eventually going on tour. From 1873, capitalising on the craze for \\"all things Japan\\", Blekman primarily focused on promoting his \\"Japanese Entertainment\\" performances (popularised by the San Francisco Japanese community), taking the moniker Tannaker Buhicrosan (perhaps part of Japanese Expat pidginSee , for the more well known Yokohama dialect.). Buhicrosan began to sell 'Japanese products' such as umbrellas and began to demonstrate real Japanese craftsmen and their works in the show in mock-up traditional 'Old Japan' style houses (a popular 19th century infantile notion of Japan) with food stalls and another 'Japanese' temple attached. In 1874 he moved to London, and in 1879 he married a British-Japanese woman, Ruth Otake Buchirosan (1851–1914), settling in Hither Lane, Lewisham, London, where they had 10 children.Paper Butterflies: Unravelling the Mystery of Tannaker Buhicrosan, Paul Budden, 2020ロンドン日本人村を作った男 〔謎の興行師タナカー・ブヒクロサン 1839–94〕, 単行本, 2015https://www.freebmd.org.uk/cgi/search.pl, 'Buhicrosan' under Birth certifcates from 1851–1910 in Lewisham thumb In premises in Milton Street, Finsbury, in December 1883 Buhicrosan 'set up The Japanese Native Village Exhibition and Trading Company Limited with a number of associates, including Cornelius B.

Buhicrosan was to receive a salary of at least £1,000' from his new trading venture. Buhicrosan in January 1885 opened the Japanese Village in Knightsbridge, London, at Humphreys' Hall, attracting great success with 250,000 visitors, the popularity of which was boosted by Gilbert and Sullivan's comic opera hit, The Mikado, which opened in March 1885. The village burned down in May, causing surrounding property damage and killing a Japanese carpenter. The troupe had already been engaged to appear at the appear at the 1885 International Hygiene Exhibition in Berlins Exhibition Park. In December 1885 the village reopened in London with 'several streets of shops ... two temples and various free- standing idols, and a pool spanned by a rustic bridge'. The village employed over 100 people, such as Japanese craftsmen, performers and artisans in London. The novelty had worn off on the public by 1887, and the village was closed in June.

It was formerly attributed to the Flemish sculptor François Duquesnoy. It was realized after 1638, possibly around 1641, and is currently housed at the National Gallery of Ireland. Bentivoglio was nuncio in Brussels from 1607 to 1615. He later was entrusted with the post of Cardinal Protector of France in Rome. In Rome, he came into contact with the artists Peter Paul Rubens and Anthony van Dyck, who belonged to the same circle as François Duquesnoy. Bentivoglio was a patron of Flemish artists in Rome. He was also an intimate collaborator of Pope Urban VIII. Duquesnoy had become Urban's protégé in 1626. The bust is relatively static, with carefully carved details such as the pouches under the Cardinal's eyes. The sitter was identified by comparing the bust with a portrait of Bentivoglio by Van Dyck.

Such screening techniques are typically classified as either targeted, where compounds of interest are chosen before the analysis begins, or non-targeted, where compounds of interest are chosen at a later stage of the analysis. These two techniques can be organized into at least three approaches: target screening, using reference standards that are analogous to the target compound; suspect screening, which uses a library of cataloged data such as exact mass, isotope patterns, and chromatographic retention times in lieu of reference standards; and non-target screening, using no pre-existing knowledge for comparison before analysis. As such, target screening is most useful when monitoring the presence of specific organic compounds—particularly for regulatory purposes—which requires higher selectivity and sensitivity. When the number of detected compounds and associated metabolites needs to be maximized for discovering new or emerging environmental trends or biomarkers for disease, a more non-targeted approach has traditionally been used. However, the rapid improvement of mass spectrometers into more high-resolution forms, with increased sensitivity, has made suspect and non-target screening more attractive, either as stand-alone approaches or in conjunction with more targeted methods. Approaches to environmental screening Mass spectrometry is used in conjunction with chromatography for environmental screening processes. Mass spectrometry methods are generally used for analysis of environmental contaminant monitoring, particularly in aquatic environments (though they can be applied in non-aquatic environments, such as with screening pesticides on plant matter), paired with chromatography for separation. For target screening, this means using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods \\"that use single reaction monitoring (SIM) or selected reaction monitoring (SRM) modes.\\" However, for suspect and non-target screening, these methods are inadequate due to recording only a limited number of compounds and insufficient useful information can be determined about unknown compounds, particularly given the dearth of LC-MS comparison libraries. For those non- targeted screening approaches, high-resolution mass spectrometry and high mass accuracy chromatography techniques are required. Combinations of quadrupole, time-of-flight, ion trap, and orbitrap mass spectrometry analyzers have emerged, along with high-performance liquid chromatography (and ultra-high- performance liquid chromatography), to more rapidly and effectively tackle suspect and non-target screening. =Target screening= Target screening or analysis is useful when looking for a short list of predetermined organic compounds in a sample, while ignoring other compounds that may be present. Reference standards that align with the predetermined compounds are available and used to compare attributes such as chromatographic retention time, fragmentation pattern, and isotopic pattern. The workflow for target screening requires the optimization of sample extraction, sample clean-up, and instrumentation methods to those predetermined compounds in order to achieve \\"a specific and accurate measurement.\\" Most analytical results will be quantitative in nature, given the narrow focus of screening. As such, targeted approaches have traditionally been used in regulatory monitoring schemes. The downside, however, is that many hazardous organic compounds are not covered by environmental monitoring regulation and thus not specifically targeted, and the approach is not generally adept for rapid response approaches to providing early warning of contamination events. =Suspect screening= Suspect screening is useful when looking for one or more suspected compounds with known structures in a sample, but reference standards are unavailable or don't exist. In this case, user-built databases containing information such as mass accuracy, retention time, isotopic patterns, and other structure information for the suspected compounds are consulted, filtered, and compared against the results of high-resolution mass spectrometry analyses using SRM or full scans. The structure of the suspected compounds are then elucidated based on that information, ideally confirmed with authentic reference standards. Compared to targeted screening, the initial work performed in suspect screening is largely qualitative, with more quantitative work to potentially follow in a more targeted approach. Aside from being able to analyze for more compounds, an additional benefit of this approach is that retrospective analysis, even years later, is enabled without reanalyzing the sample. A downside to the suspect approach is the complexity involved, including not only with data analysis (e.g., using in silico fragmentation software) but also carefully developing suspect screening lists and choosing databases. =Non-target screening= Non-target screening is useful when needing to investigate the presences of all the organic compounds within a sample. In this case, since no information is known about the compounds contained in the sample, no reference standard can be used for comparison, at least initially, overall making non-target screening one of the most challenging approaches. Rather, a full automated scan with mass filtering, peak detection, and other characteristics is used to make initial compound detection. Then elemental composition of detected compounds is deduced using accurate mass of the ions. Database searches can be performed to get a lock on what the most plausible structures are given the elemental composition. Like suspect screening, the initial work performed in non-target screening is largely qualitative, with more quantitative work to potentially follow. Similar to suspect screening, the downside to a fully non- targeted approach is the data-intensive nature of the processes, requiring multivariate statistical models, and the wide variety of data processing workflows used by researchers further complicates evaluation of method performance of those data analysis processes.

The hosts of a special celebration in Detroit honoring Scharfstein on his seventieth birthday in 1954 described him as \\"one of the country's leading Jewish educators\\" whose Hebrew instructional materials were in very wide use in the United States. His 1972 obituary in the New York Times attributed a hundred Hebrew textbooks for children to his credit, many of which in the early 1970s were \\"still considered classics in Hebrew schools.\\" Scharfstein was educated as a child by private tutors, and his only official academic degree was an honorary Doctor of Hebrew Letters, awarded by the Jewish Theological Seminary of America. But his prolific career and founding of the Shilo publishing house made him \\"a teacher of teachers\\" in the Jewish Diaspora.  Personal life  Scharfstein was born in the Podolia region of the Russian Empire, in present-day Ukraine. During his childhood, he was strongly influenced by the Haskalah movement, and the movement's emphasis on childhood education and the development of a contemporary Hebrew press both shaped his life and career. After witnessing the violence of pogroms in the region followed by the onset of World War I, Scharfstein immigrated to the United States \\"without a broken heart.\\" He wrote of \\"writing new textbooks intended and prepared for the young generation of America.\\"  Career  Once in the US, he quickly founded a monthly magazine for children, Shaharut (Youth). Published by the Bureau of Jewish Education in New York City, Shaharut's original mission was to teach Jewish topics and Hebrew language. After the 1917 Balfour Declaration, the periodical shifted to short stories and articles about Jewish life in Palestine. Scharfstein also joined the Bureau of Jewish Education, founded by noted American Hebraist Samson Benderly in 1910, although Scharfstein was not among the group of proteges known as \\"the Benderly Boys,\\" Scharfstein believing that Benderly often preferred American-born recruits over immigrants. In the early 1920s, he founded Shilo Publishing House with the help of his brother, Asher. Controlling his own press and going to market with his own materials freed Scharfstein from the limitations of working within the existing philosophical, pedagogical, and financial power structures of the Hebraist movement. One of his first books was emblematic of his mission: Sifurei ha-Torah le-yeladim (Torah Stories for Children). Shilo is still in operation, offering books on \\"the Hebrew language, studying to read the Haftorah, and the works of Nachmanides,\\" as well as a widely used Siddur for children and Hebrew-English and English- Hebrew dictionaries. Scharfstein's educational materials, textbooks writing, and curriculum development emphasized stories, pictures, and formats that modeled and extolled a lifestyle that was both Jewish and American. His texbooks featured stories about American Jewish children enjoying American life within the context of Jewish perspectives and values. He also penned biographic sketches and profiles of American Jews to illuminate how they could become both emblematically American and Jewish figures. Together with his son, Ben-Ami Scharfstein, he authored the first Hebrew textbook for blind English- speaking readers with The Jewish Braille Institute. Ben-Ami went on to teach philosophy at Tel Aviv University.

Lotic rose to prominence through her involvement with the Janus Collective in the early 2010s as well as with a string of EPs released during this time. She was invited by Björk to produce two official Vulnicura remixes in 2016. Her full-length debut, Power, was released in 2018.  Early life  Morgan was born and raised in Houston where she participated in her high school marching band playing alto saxophone. She attended the University of Texas at Austin to study film and music composition.  Career  Morgan first became interested in DJing in 2009 after seeing a Kingdom set while still a student at UT Austin. Her involvement with the KVRX student radio station marked the beginning of her own electronic music career as she frequently performed live DJ sets at station showcases and events around Austin. She released music during this time under Ben Aqua’s #FEELINGS label. After graduating college in 2012, Morgan moved to Berlin with her boyfriend to pursue a career in music while working for Ableton. Later that year, she became affiliated with the Janus Collective, a group described in the New York Times as part of an enclave of American expatriates “ taking over sleepy venues, creating their own parties and leaving a significant imprint on the city’s musical program.” Morgan became affiliated with Janus after meeting founders Dan D’Norch and Michael Ladner. The next year, she released the mixtape Fallout, which she followed with the Damsel in Distress mixtape in 2014. Morgan released two EPs in 2015: Heterocetera and Agitations. In 2016, she was commissioned by Björk to produce two official remixes of “Notget” from Vulnicura;she also served as an opening act on the Berlin date of the Vulnicura Tour. That fall, she scored a promotional video for fashion brand ifeoma’s spring/summer 2017 collection. She also soundtracked the autumn/winter 2017 Julius Society show at Paris Fashion Week. Her full-length debut, Power, was released in 2018. Accompanying this release was Endless Power, an audio-visual production created in collaboration with lighting designer Emmanuel Biard. Endless Power was performed at Berlin’s CTM Festival and Sónar in Barcelona. That year, she also performed in and scored “Embryogenesis” and “Fleshless Beast,” dance pieces choreographed by Roderick George. Along with Floating Points and Raven, Morgan scored the 2019 KDV Dance Ensemble performance piece “Las Casas Invisibles” choreographed by Kianí del Valle. She also contributed to a remix compilation of tracks from Polish cellist Resina’s 2018 album Traces. In May 2020, Morgan announced a deal with Houndstooth Records after Tri Angle records shut down the previous month. Her release of the single “Burn a Print” coincided with the signing announcement. The following single, “Cocky,” was released that August. = Artistry = Morgan’s work as Lotic often addresses social and political issues. Although she now lives in Berlin, her work draws from the African American experience; her sound pays homage to ball culture and drumlines and the album Power was inspired in part by Between the World and Me by Ta-Nehisi Coates. She also explores gender in her music, naming an EP Heterocetera after encountering the term in the work of Audre Lorde. Pitchfork locates Lotic within the broader trend of “conceptronica” that arose in the 2010s, comparing her to artists like Elysia Crampton and Chino Amobi. Stylistically, critics note the tension between softness and aggression in Lotic’s music. Morgan herself considers her sound to have a more sensual edge than her “techno-centric” Berlin contemporaries. 2018’s Power marked a stylistic shift for Lotic. Not only was it the first release incorporating Morgan’s vocals, but critics noted a “gentler” musical approach compared to her previous, club-oriented releases. Morgan cites VenusX of GHE20G0TH1K fame and Kingdom as influences.  Personal life  Morgan is transgender, first announcing her transition in 2018. She has criticized the exclusive, “male-centric” nature of Berlin’s queer scene and is vocal about racism and homophobia in the broader world of electronic music. Morgan was briefly married to her first boyfriend after they moved to Berlin together; the couple has since split. In 2016, Morgan was evicted from her apartment after the individual she subleased from did not pay the full rent. She worked on Power sporadically over the subsequent two-year period while experiencing homelessness.

Both countries were created following the dissolution of Austria-Hungary in 1918. First Austrian Republic was a successor state of the empire while Yugoslavia was created after the unification of pre-World War I Kingdom of Serbia with the State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (former South Slavic parts of the Austria-Hungary). In the days before this unification Kingdom of Serbia merged with the Banat, Bačka and Baranja and the Kingdom of Montenegro. During the interwar period of European history relations between the First Austrian Republic and the Kingdom of Yugoslavia were marked by the Austro-Slovene conflict in Carinthia, 1920 Carinthian plebiscite, 1920 establishment of pro-status quo Little Entente, 1934 Rome Protocols between revanchist Austria, Hungary and Fascist Italy and 1938 Anschluss. After the Anschluss until the of World War II in 1945 Austria was under National Socialism and a part of the Nazi Germany. World War II in Yugoslavia started on 6 April 1941 and led to country's partition and initiation of the prolonged guerrilla liberation war fought against the Axis and their locally established puppet regimes.

Embassy of Yugoslavia in Vienna (today Embassy of Croatia) Embassy of Austria in Belgrade (since 1955) After the end of the war Austria was under the Allied occupation while Yugoslavia was reunited under the name of the Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia. Once it was signed by Austria and the four occupying powers (France, Soviet Union, United Kingdom and United States) the Austrian State Treaty was signed also by neighboring Yugoslavia. Austria, as an neutral country, and post 1948 Tito–Stalin split Yugoslavia as a non- aligned country, collaborated closely on building bridges in the Cold War Europe, particularly within the framework of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (modern day OSCE). The formal relationship further developed with the establishment of the Alps-Adriatic Working Group in 1978. In 1989, together with Hungary and Italy, Austria and Yugoslavia were the founding members of the Central European Initiative. While at the initial stages of the Yugoslav crisis Austria was still not a member state of the emerging European Union, the country still was a vocal advocate of the right of self-determination both for the Socialist Republic of Slovenia and the Socialist Republic of Croatia.

Location Rawdon College is on Woodlands Drive in Rawdon, West Yorkshire. It is set in woodlands looking over the River Aire, and was built specifically for use as a residential college. Robert Milligan sold the land to the Baptists, and then gave back half the purchase price. The college was designed by the architect J. H. Paul of Cardiff. The buildings were in Tudor Gothic style, with the library, classroom and principal's residence in the central building, and student apartments on each side. The cost was more than ₤12,000. History Rawdon College replaced the Horton Academy of Little Horton, Bradford, which the Yorkshire and Lancashire Baptists had founded in 1804, using an adapted weaving shed as its premises. Horton and Rawdon were both run by the Northern Baptist Education Society. Rawdon College was opened on 4 September 1859 in a ceremony attended by 700 people. The president of the meeting was Sir Francis Crossley, of Halifax. Sir Titus Salt, the industrialist who created Saltaire, was present. The purpose of the college was to identify and train evangelistic preachers. At first students were prepared to take degrees at the University of London. James Aeworth was head of Horton and then Rawdon College from 1836 to 1853. William Medley taught at Rawdon from 1869 to 1908, and was the most significant philosopher at the college. He was the author of Christ the Truth. An Essay towards the Organization of Christian Thinking (1900). Rawdon was affiliated to the University of Leeds in 1904. During World War I (1914–1918) Midland Baptist College was closed and Rawdon acquired most of its assets. At the start of World War II (1939–1945) the college had 30 men, but there were only four in 1944, so the college closed until 1946. In 1961 Rawdon was merged with Manchester College to create the new Northern Baptist College, which was based in the Manchester premises. Between 1964 and 1975 the college was used to house students of the Trinity and All Saints' Teacher Training College. In 1983 the college building was converted into 17 apartments known as Larchmore. The site, containing other buildings, is known as Larchwood. In September 2010 a blue plaque was erected on Woodlands Drive to commemorate the former college.

Completed and commissioned in November 1944, she served in World War II and was sunk in July 1945. Construction and commissioning I-372 was laid down on 10 February 1944 by Yokosuka Navy Yard at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 2961. She was launched on 26 June 1944 and renamed I-372 that day. She was completed and commissioned on 8 November 1944. Service history Upon commissioning, I-372 was attached to the Sasebo Naval District and was assigned to Submarine Squadron 11 for workups. She was reassigned to Submarine Squadron 7 on 8 January 1945. =Transport operations= On 8 February 1945, I-372 departed Yokosuka bound for Takao on Formosa. She was then to rescue Imperial Japanese Army Air Force pilots stranded at Batulinao in the Aparri area of northern Luzon in the Philippine Islands as a result of Japanese setbacks in the Philippines campaign, but after the submarines and were lost attempting to pick up the pilots, she received orders to abort the mission and return to Japan. She arrived at Kure on 14 February 1945. The Japanese next considered sending I-372 to Iwo Jima with a cargo of artillery shells, but abandoned the idea. Instead, on 16 February 1945 I-372 began conversion at Kure Navy Yard into a tanker submarine capable of carrying 90 metric tons of aviation gasoline. During her conversion, she probably also had a submarine snorkel installed. In mid-March 1945 she moved to Yokosuka, and on 20 March 1945 Submarine Squadron 7 was deactivated and she was reassigned to Submarine Division 16 along with the submarines , , , and . On 1 April 1945, I-372 departed Yokosuka on a supply voyage to Wake Island. On 4 April 1945, Fleet Radio Unit, Melbourne (FRUMEL), an Allied signals intelligence unit headquartered at Melbourne, Australia, reported that it had intercepted and decrypted Japanese signal traffic indicating that a Japanese submarine would arrive at Wake Island on 17 April 1945 and begin several nights of unloading and loading operations there. The United States Navy submarine was alerted to this at 04:00 on 16 April 1945 via an Ultra intelligence signal from Guam and moved to intercept the Japanese submarine. On 18 April 1945, Sea Owl detected I-372 on radar northwest of Wake. I-372′s radar detector failed to detect Sea Owl′s radar signal, and I-372 anchored at Wake without her crew realizing that any Allied forces were in the area. Sea Owl approached the anchorage and fired three torpedoes at I-372 at a range of . Two of them failed to detonate, and the third missed I-372 but destroyed Wake Island's pier. I-372 crash-dived, and after World War II the U.S. Joint Army-Navy Assessment Committee erroneously credited Sea Owl with sinking the submarine that day. I-372 did not surface again until 19 April 1945, when she finished unloading her cargo — which included enough rice to feed Wake Island's garrison for ten days — and embarked 29 passengers. She then got underway for Yokosuka, which she reached on 29 April 1945. I-372′s next supply run also was to Wake Island. She departed Yokosuka on 15 June 1945, and FRUMEL again detected her movements, reporting that day that \\"A Japanese submarine left Tokyo Bay at 09:00 on 15th [June 1944] to pass 5 [nautical] miles [9.3 km; 5.8 mi] south of Nojima Saki at 20:00 on passage to Wake Island.\\" She avoided interception by Allied forces, however, and arrived at Wake on 28 June 1945, unloaded her cargo, and headed back to Yokosuka, where she arrived on 10 July 1945. =Loss= During an air raid on Yokosuka by U.S. Navy Task Force 38 aircraft on 18 July 1945, I-372 came under attack by TBM Avenger torpedo bombers and F6F Hellcat fighters from the aircraft carriers , , , and . The attack killed one member of her crew, and a bomb that landed close aboard ruptured her starboard cargo hold. She slowly sank. Deemed beyond salvage, she was abandoned. Final disposition Hostilities between Japan and the Allies came to an end on 15 August 1945, and in September 1945 U.S. Navy divers from the submarine tender inspected I-372′s wreck. The Japanese struck her from the Navy list on 15 September 1945. In August 1946 the wreck was refloated, towed into deep water, and scuttled. Notes Sources * Hackett, Bob & Kingsepp, Sander.

They bear similarities with a number of dry stone vernacular building types found in other Mediterranean countries, and they are primarily used for storage or as temporary shelters. It is possible that in the past they were also used for human habitation.  History and use  It is not known when the first giren were constructed in Malta. Their typology bears some similarities with the Megalithic Temples of Malta, although there is no conclusive proof that the building traditions are directly linked, and it has been suggested that the resemblance is superficial. The huts also share characteristics with other vernacular constructions in the Mediterranean region, such as the nuraghe of Sardinia, the trulli of Apulia, the bunje of the former Yugoslavia, the ' of France and other types of huts found in Sicily and Libya. A girna in a rural area, surrounded by rubble walls In his 1536 publication Insulae Melitae Descriptio, Jean Quintin mentioned that the Maltese countryside contained many vernacular structures which he called \\"African huts\\", and this might have referred to the girna. Larger giren were probably used for human habitation, and it is likely that many were abandoned as isolated rural communities gave way to larger villages and towns in the 17th and 18th centuries. Smaller giren were mostly used to store tools or hay, as temporary shelters for farmers or herders, or to house goats, sheep or other livestock. The frequency of giren near certain quarries, such as in Qala on Gozo, suggests that some were also used as shelters for workmen. Due to the primitive nature of their construction, giren were not particularly influenced by changes which occurred in other aspects of Maltese architecture over the centuries. Assigning a date of construction to a particular girna is difficult unless it is documented in other evidence, but it is believed that many of the existing structures are relatively recent. The first study of the girna was made by Paul Cassar in 1961, and several other studies have been published since then, most notably a book in Maltese by historian Mikiel Fsadni in 1990 which was also translated to English in 1992. Many giren have been lost through neglect, but many others still exist and some remain in use, mainly for storage. A few giren are still being built as of the early 21st century; for example, one was constructed at the Ta' Blankas olive grove in Xewkija in 2014 as part of a refurbishment project.  Locations  A girna complex at the Majjistral Park Most giren are found in rural areas in the northern part of the main island of Malta. They are especially frequent in the limits of Mellieħa, including the land around Manikata, l-Aħrax tal-Mellieħa, the area around Selmun Palace and the area between Saint Agatha's Tower and Paradise Bay. Over 30 giren can be found in the Majjistral Park. Other areas in the northwestern part of Malta which contain some giren include Żebbiegħ, Bidnija, Dingli, Baħrija and Mtaħleb. The areas where giren are located usually contain rocky outcrops of hard coralline limestone, which was the main material used in the huts' construction. These areas tended to lack more workable materials such as globigerina limestone. This might explain why giren are less common in the southern part of Malta and on the island of Gozo, where globigerina limestone is abundant and where it was often used to construct ashlar masonry buildings. Most giren in Gozo are clustered in the parts of the island which consist of Upper Coralline Limestone, such as Xagħra, Nadur and Qala.  Characteristics  The interior of a girna built adjacent to an 18th-century building known as the Devil's Farmhouse Giren are huts constructed out of undressed dry stone, and they were usually built out of loose pieces of coralline limestone, which were either obtained through quarrying or through clearing loose stones from a piece of land in order to allow for it to be cultivated. The walls are usually around thick, and they consist of two skins of stone with a rubble infill known as mazkan in between. The roof of the girna is constructed using corbelling, with each row of stones jutting out slightly from the row below it, gradually reducing the size of the opening until flat stone slabs can be used to span it. This results in a dome-shaped concave ceiling, bearing similarities to ancient beehive tombs. Gravel and torba were usually used to cover the roof, while sometimes a pebble-like material called ċagħqija was used for this purpose. Most giren have a circular plan, but there are some which are square, rectangular or oval-shaped. They usually have a single door facing east or south, and this opening is spanned by lintels, while some also have windows. Some giren were additionally buttressed by rubble walls, and a few allow access to the roof through an external staircase or ramp. There are also examples of giren with two floors, consisting of one hut built on top of another. Mangers were sometimes found inside giren used to raise livestock. The huts are prone to collapse if they are left without proper maintenance.  Influence on architecture  In the 1960s, the Maltese architect Richard England drew inspiration from the girna when designing the curved walls of the Manikata parish church, which is regarded as one of the most iconic 20th century churches in Malta. England also designed a residential building called Villa Girna which used the vernacular huts as a source of inspiration, but it was never actually constructed.

Lindsay, published in August 2020. The book was listed on the bestsellers lists of Publishers Weekly, USA Today, and Calgary Herald. Summary Cynical Theories contrasts the academic approaches of liberalism and postmodernism, then explains how applied postmodernism (which focuses on ought rather than is) has displaced other approaches to activism and scholarship. The authors present several academic fields—postcolonial theory, queer theory, critical race theory, intersectionality, fourth-wave feminism, gender studies, fat studies, and ableism—and describe how the 'applied postmodernism' approach has developed in each field. The authors use capitalization to distinguish between the liberal concept of social justice and the ideological movement of Social Justice that they state has reified postmodernism. Reception A review published by the James G. Martin Center for Academic Renewal takes issue with some of the book's historical claims about feminism, as well as disagreeing with its policy suggestions, stating \\"Cynical Theories offers a great examination of the problem within academia, but so far as policy suggestions go, it only offers vague utopian wishes.\\" However, the review also says, \\"Barring a few flaws, Cynical Theories is essential reading for anyone looking to reform or preserve the classical Western academy.\\" Douglas Murray wrote an admiring review of Cynical Theories for The Times, saying \\"I have rarely read such a good summary of how postmodernism evolved from the 1960s onwards.\\" Murray concludes, \\"Yet as I put down the book and turned on the news I couldn't help thinking that this deconstruction of the deconstructionists may have arrived just a moment too late.\\" A Spiked reviewer says that the authors provide \\"a huge service in translating the language of today’s activists and explaining to readers not steeped in critical theory or postmodernism how the world looks from the perspective of those who are,\\" but notes that \\"[w]hile Cynical Theories offers an excellent account of how postmodern scholarship morphed into social-justice activism, it is less persuasive when it comes to why this happened.\\" The review states, \\"What’s largely missing from Cynical Theories is a broader political contextualisation of social-justice activism.\\" Nick Fouriezos of OZY magazine describes Cynical Theories as \\"the first cohesive attempt to tie together the intellectual strands of the intellectual dark web\\" and notes its \\"blind spots\\" in suggesting that the movements for civil rights, LGBT protections, and feminism had achieved almost total victory by the 1980s while ignoring significant issues that had persisted since then. Tim Smith-Laing in The Daily Telegraph says the authors \\"leap from history to hysteria\\" and the book fails to fulfill the \\"values of rational, evidence-based argument\\" that it praises. On Liberal Currents in a review focused on chapter eight of Cynical Theories, Samuel Hoadley-Brill suggests that many of the book's citations and paraphrases of the scholarship that Pluckrose and Lindsay critique are misleading and based on cherry-picking. Hoadley-Brill concludes that the chapter \\"suffers from the exact same problems Pluckrose and Lindsay diagnose in Social Justice scholarship—namely, misplaced cynicism combined with unwarranted confidence in such cynical interpretations. Critical scrutiny exposes an embarrassing fact: Pluckrose and Lindsay have done a better job of revealing themselves as cynical theorists than revealing any of the theories they discuss as cynical.\\" Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Simon Jenkins wrote that within half an hour of starting he thought he had \\"had enough of this book. Helen Pluckrose and James Lindsay seemed obsessed by a straw man, a fake foe. Their opponents, I felt, were surely well-intentioned and did not really believe what they were accused of believing.\\" He went on, however, \\"I read on and now think differently.\\" He cited the conclusion \\"refreshing\\" in that they offered no \\"counter-revolutionary strategy\\" or \\"demand that Theory be suppressed,\\" but rather only call for the support of \\"reason, debate, tolerance, democracy and the rule of law.\\" He wrote that book illuminates \\"one of those sidetracks in Western ideology that led to both Salem and Weimar.\\" References Category:2020 non-fiction books Category:Criticism of postmodernism Category:Literary collaborations ","title":"Cynical Theories"},{"id":"65366099","text":"Barna A.

Fascist Huxley-Blythe was born in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, the son of Annie Huxley and Henry Blythe. His father was a self-proclaimed \\"consultant hypnotist\\" who often worked as a stage hypnotist in the music halls and once ran as a candidate for the Labour Party under the slogan \\"Look into my Eyes and Vote for Me\\". Shortly after his birth, his family moved to London.\\". His parents' marriage broke up when he was young and he was raised by his mother. He attended Chapel Royal Hampton Court and the St Mary of the Angels school, where he specilised in choir singing. As a teenager, he was strongly attracted to the British Union of Fascists movement led by Sir Oswald Mosely. He attended the Royal Naval College at Dartmouth and in 1939 he was assigned to the training ship HMS Arethusa. During the Second World War, he served in the Royal Navy in the Atlantic, Mediterrean and Pacific theaters. He went to sea in 1942, and served abroad HMS Renown for two years. He then served on abroad HMS Highflyer, HMS Virago and HMS Rapid. An extreme anti-communist with a hankering for authoritarian leadership, after his honourable discharge from the Navy, Huxley-Blythe was a member of the revived British Union Movement led by Mosely as the British Union of Fascists been renamed, but he become close to the American thinker Francis Parker Yockey. When Yockey broke with Mosely, Huxley-Bythe followed the former into the European Liberation Front (ELF). Huxley-Blythe shared Yockey's fears about the \\"cultural-racial decline\\" of the West, and like him saw the United States as a \\"mongelised\\" society that was a corrupting influence on the rest of the world. The \\"12-point plan\\" of the ELF, which was partially written by Huxley- Blythe called \\"the immediate expulsion of all Jews and other parasitic aliens from the Soil of Europe\\" together with the \\"cleansing of the Soul of Europe from the ethical syphilis of Hollywood\\". In 1950, Huxley-Blythe who had remained a officer with the Royal Naval Reserve was called up to service during the Korean War and lost touch with Yockely. During his Korean War service, he got to know a Lieutenant Hillary Cotter, a self-proclaimed \\"Catholic fascist\\" who was to influence his thinking. It was through Cotter that Huxley-Blythe first learned of the Russian Liberation Army, better known as the Vlasov Army, which became a subject that was greatly interest him for the rest of his life. His interest in the Russian Libearation Army was \\"change radically his views about Russia\\". After his return from Korea, Huxley-Blythe resumed his far-right associations. He broke with Yockey over what he claimed were his pro-Soviet views, writing in a letter to the FBI in 1961 that he ceased associating with Yorkey when the latter \\"praised Soviet policy in Germany\\" and urged his followers \\"to help him organise secret partisan bands of neo-Nazis in West Germany, bands which would collaborate with the Soviet Military Authorities against the Western occupation powers\\". On 2 February 1952, Huxley-Blythe wrote to the Canadian fascist Adrien Arcand asking for permission to publish in German his anti-Semitic pamphlet La Clé du mystère, writing: \\"I’m anxious to obtain two hundred (200) copies of your excellent work, The Key to the Mystery as soon as possible to fulfill an order I have received from Germany\\". Permission was granted, and on 27 February 1952 he wrote to Arcand for permission to print up 300 more copies of La Clé du mystère for sale in Great Britain. During this time, he served as a mentor to Colin Jordan. He served the editor of the ELF's journal Frontfighter and of the Anglo-German Natinform (Nationalist Information Bureau). The Natinoform was a joint venture between A. F. X. Baron and Huxley-Blythe, and fell apart when the two quarreled in 1958. At some point in the 1950s, Huxley-Blythe became friends with a George Knupffer, the self-proclaimed tutor and adviser to the Grand Duke Vladimir, the son of Grand Duke Kirill, the pretender to the Russian throne. Huxley-Blythe became involved in the quizzical plans to restore the House of Romanov to the Russian throne. Taking up the quarrels of the Russian emigres as his own, Hulxley-Blythe was relentless in attacking the NTS (Nacional'no Trudovoj Sojuz-National Alliance of Russian Solidarists) as a pro-Soviet group, using the fact that the CIA sometimes financed the NTS as proof that the group was really working for the Soviet Union. A major interest for Huxley-Blythe was the reparation of the Cossacks, a subject that he started to research in the 1950s. Huxley-Blythe first came to widespread notice with his 1955 book Betrayal: The Story of Russian Anti-Communism where he argued that the West was losing the Cold War and claimed that the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) was actually supporting Communist groups. After the Suez crisis of 1956, Huxley-Blythe's journalism as expressed in his newsletter World Survey started to take an aggressively anti-American tone as he became an obsessive critic of President Dwight Eisenhower, whom he attacked as being \\"pro-Communist\\". Huxley-Blythe attracted a following among the elements of American right disenchanted with Eisenhower who had been elected president in 1952 on a platform calling for the \\"rollback\\" of Communism, but in office pursued the same \\"containment\\" policy as Truman. Knupffer also served as the London correspondent of Task Force, the journal of an American ultra- conservative force, Defenders of the American Constitution (DAC). Through Knupffer, Huxley-Blythe get into touch with the DAC, one of whose leaders, Pedro del Valle in a book review called Betrayal an \\"excellent work\\", being deeply impressed with Huxley-Blythe's thesis that the CIA was supporting Communist groups instead of anti-Communist groups. Task Force combined its August and September editions of 1956 in order to reprint Betrayal, calling it \\"one of the most important articles it has ever been a privilege to publish\\". Likewise, the American journal Right was impressed with Huxley-Blythe's pamphlet Insecure Security claiming that the West was losing the Cold War, and an editorial in 1958 stated that Huxley-Blythe was \\"no stranger to well informed American patriots\\". Huxley-Blythe's belief in white supremacy and his attacks on nationalists demanding independence in Britain's African colonies, his opposition to non-white immigration together with equally vehement opposition to the American civil rights movement helped to make a well known figure to American rightists. In the 1950s, there was a tendency for Anglo- American white supremacists to see themselves as threatened by a common foe, and tended to link their concerns together with the support for segeration in the United States as being seen as part of the same struggle to maintain the British Empire in Africa. In his articles, Huxley-Blythe claimed to be in contact with vast underground armies behind the Iron Curtain, which were ready to rise up the moment that the West started a policy of \\"rollback\\". Huxley- Blythe compared the nuclear deterrence policies of the Eisenhower administration as the modern equlivent to the Magniot Line, demanding that the West undertake an offensive foreign policy to liquidate the Soviet Union once and for all. In 1958, he merged his journal World Survey with Pearson's journal Northlander to better promote \\"scientific and forward looking nationalism\\". Together with Roger Pearson he co-founded the Northern League in 1958 whose stated purpose was to protect the \\"Nordic race\\" from the \\"annihilation of our kind\\" and to struggle \\"against forces which would mongrelise our race and civilisation\\". In 1958, he demanded in a public letter to the Prime Minister Harold Macmillan that Britain pay reparations to the survivors of the Cossack reparation, a request that was refused. Afterwards, Huxley-Blythe drew up a petition which he submitted to Queen Elizbeth II criticising Macmillan and demanding that Britain pay compensation to the Cossacks. A major theme of Huxley-Blythe's writings was a tendency to equate \\"Western civilization\\" with being white and Christian together with a deep fear of \\"cosmopolitism\\" and racial \\"degeneracy\\". Huxley-Blythe was obsessed with the theme of maintaining racial purity for the \\"Nordic race\\" (defined as white, Christian people originating form north-west Europe) and believed that various phenomenon such as non-white immigration to Britain and civil rights movement in the United States were all part of the same \\"Communist plot\\" to destroy the \\"Nordic race\\" via misegratation. Alongside this a major theme of the writings of Huxley-Blythe and other writers associated with the Northern League was the basic inequality of humanity supported by pseudo-scientific studies purporting to prove that non-while peoples had lower IQs than white people. In April-May 1961, he covered the trial of Adolf Eichmann in Jerusalem for the anti-Semitic The American Mercury magazine. His coverage was turned into the 2011 book The Eichmann Trial: An Incredible Spectacle by a Protestant fundamentalist minister from Tulsa, Gerald S. Pope, who served as an editor of the American Mercury. The editorials written by Pope in the American Mercury were strongly anti-Semitic and white supremacist with the cover story of one issue from 1970 reading \\"Shall We Die for Isreal?\\". In a 1961 editorial about the civil rights movement Pope declared: \\"Enlightened Americans are not intimidated by propaganda that says discrimination in any form is wrong. They know that such philosophy is the work of the enemies of freedom who seek to destroy individualism and to create in its place a collectivism that treats man as a faceless member of society\\". In 1964, Huxle-Blythe turned his pamphlet Betrayal into the book The East Came West, where he accused General Eisenhower and various British leaders such as Winston Churchill of being war criminals by forcibly repatriating Soviet citizens after World War Two. He praised what he called \\"Cossacks’ fight for freedom from 1941 until 1945 and from them he learned the method used by the British to betray them. Former members of the Russian Liberation Army and refugees told him of the treatment they had received from U.S. troops who forced them back to the merciless Soviet leaders using rifles and bayonets.\\" Huxley-Blythe was the first writer in English on the subject, and through his writings on the subject were \\"highly partisan\\", he sparked interest in the matter. In his best-selling 1977 book Victims of Yalta, Count Nikolai Tolstoy called Huxley-Blythe \\"my friend\\" and praised him for his \\"readable outline of the whole story\\" in The East Came West. Crank Starting in the 1960s, he started to promote hypnotism as the cure for various illness and began to portray himself as an expert in curing learning disabilities in children. He founded the Blythe College of Hypnotherapy and lectured in both the United Kingdom and Sweden on the alleged medical benefits of hypnotism. He claimed to be awarded a PhD in Psychosomatic Medicine at an unnamed American university. Despite admitting that he \\"knew nothing\\" about the subject of learning disabilities in children, he delivered in 1969 a well received lecture on the subject about helping children with reading difficulties, which led him to become interested in the subject. Reflecting his interest in alternative medicine, Huxley-Blythe published in the 1970s several books such as Hypnotism–its power and practice (1971), Stress Disease (1973), Drugless Medicine (1974) and Self Hypnotism—its potential and practice (1976) extolling alternative medicine as preferable to conventional medicine. His health books were published under the name Peter Blythe instead of Peter Huxley-Blythe. In 1975, he published a biography of Nicholas Dulger-Sheikin, a Russo-Greek man who worked as a spy in World War Two under the title The Man Who Was Uncle: The Biography Of A Master Spy. In 1975, he founded the Institute for Neuro-Physiological Psychology (INPP), based in Chester, England. The INPP was a pseudo-scientific group that hosted speakers such as a Dr. Richard Halvorsen who claimed autism was caused by measles vaccines and a Dr. Ursula Anderson who claimed that stem cells were regenerated by human memories. Huxley-Blythe and others at the INPP claimed that various childhood developmental issues such as Asperger's symptom, Attention Deficit Disorder, and problems with learning math were caused by \\"neurodevelopmental delay\\", which was described as the failure of a child's brain to inhibit the motor reflexes seen in infants that are normally switched off as a child ages. The INPP professed to be able to cure \\"neurodevelopmental delay\\" for a price. The American representative of the INPP was a \\"Doctor\\" Curtius Cripe who falsely claimed to have a PhD in psychology from the Saybrook Institute while in fact his PhD was from the non-accredited Barrington University awarded in an on-line course and his supervisor had a degree in interior design, not psychology. In 2014, Discover magazine called the INPP a collection of \\"dubious people\\" promoting theories with no scientific basis. The same article noted the website for the INPP had had a footnote attached to the statement \\"Peter Blythe, PhD\\" reading \\"The INPP is an apolitical organization. It does not reflect or support any political, cultural, social or religious ideology or the personal views of its members or former members.\\" About this statement, the article noted: \\"Well, that's good to hear. Because if they did reflect the ideology of their members, let's say, of their founder, then they would be a fascist organization. Quite literally.\\" In 1979, he published a book with Douglas McGlown An Organic Basis for Neuroses and Educational Difficulties, where he argued that learning disabilities in children were caused by disorders in the central nervous system, which could be cursed without drugs by his methods. His cure for learning disabilities was to \\"take back the body\\" of a learning disabled child back to infancy, which would be \\"reconditioned\\" to have the nervous system work properly by having the mind \\"connect\\" to the body. The website for the Institute for Neuro-Physiological Psychology claimed that the \\"INPP Method\\" of \\"reconditioning\\" the body had cured thousands of children with learning disabilities since the 1970s. In 2001, he retired as the director of the INPP, to be succeeded by his wife Sally. In 2004, he published his last book, Under the St. Andrew's Cross, an admiring account of Russian volunteers who fought for Nazi Germany in World War Two with a foreword by Count Nikolai Tolstoy. In writing Under the St. Andrew's Cross, he was assisted by Antonio J. Muñoz, a Cuban-American amateur historian who specialises in the Eastern Front. Huxley- Blythe was closely involved in the INPP until a year before his death, and the institute is now headed by his widow Sally. About Sally Blythe, the British psychologist Dorothy V. M. Bishop wrote in 2011: \\"Mrs Goddard Blythe is entitled to her views. My concern is with the blurring of the distinction between opinion and evidence. When a view about effects of parenting is widely promulgated on national media, and is expressed by someone who is described as a consultant in neurodevelopmental education and Director of an Institute, the natural assumption is made that (a) they are speaking from a position of authority, and (b) they have some hard evidence. In this case, neither appears to be true.\\" Work *Betrayal: The Story of Russian Anti-Communism, London: Friends of National Russia, 1955. *The East Came West, Caldwell, Idaho: Caxton, 1964. *Hypnotism: Its Power and Practice, London: Taplinger, 1971 . *Stress Disease The Glowing Plague, London: Arthur Barker, 1973, . *Drugless Medicine Herbalism, Homopathy, Naturopathy, Osteopathy, Chripopathic, London: Arthur Barker, 1974, *The man who was Uncle: The biography of a master spy, London: Arthur Barker, 1975, . *Self-Hypnotism Its Power and Potential, London: Arthur Barker, 1976, . *Co-written with David Mcglown An Organic Basis for Neuroses and Educational Difficulties: A new look at the Minimal Brain Dysfunction syndrome, Chester: Insight Publications, 1979, . *Under the St. Andrew's Cross: Russian & Cossack Volunteers in World War II, 1941-1945, Bayside, NY: Europa Books, 2004 . *Foreword to Miracle Children: Behavior and Learning Disabilities by Anna Buck, Anna's House, LLC: , Northglenn, Colorado, 2008. *The Eichmann Trial: An Incredible Spectacle Literary Licensing, LLC: Whitefish, Montana, 2011, . *Emotions that kill feelings that heal: How modern medicine has divorced the mind from the body, Chester: Insight Publication, 2016.

Sandro Gerbi Biography Sandro Gerbi was born in Peru because his father Antonello (1904-1976), who at the time was senior economist of Banca Commerciale Italiana, had been transferred there in 1938 by his boss, Raffaele Mattioli. As a matter of fact, Antonello was in the verge of being dismissed from his job as a consequence of Italian racial laws (against people of Jewish origins). Antonello, in 1940, married his Viennese girlfriend, Herma Schimmerling (1912-2012), who had joined him in Lima. They had two children: Daniele (b. 1941) and Sandro (b. 1943). In the spring of 1948, the Gerbi family returned to Milan, where Sandro completed his secondary education (at the Liceo Classico \\"A. Manzoni”), and later (1967) obtained a Law degree from the local Università degli Studi (University of Milan). Sandro Gerbi was first employed (in 1968) at Banca Italo-Israeliana in Milan, and subsequently spent 6 months in the United States at Underwood Typewriter Company (as an intern) and Southern Methodist University (attending a summer course in International Law). By the end of 1969 he was hired by Scandellari-Ventura-Lanella, a Milan stockbrokers firm, as an assistant to prominent journalist and financial expert Renato Cantoni (1916-1987). It was Cantoni, at the time a regular contributor to the Italian daily papers, Il Sole 24 Ore (Milan) and La Stampa (Turin), who introduced him to the world of journalism. In 1971, Gerbi began collaborating with the weekly Il Mondo writing articles about financial affairs until 1975. Between 1976 and 1978 he was a financial commentator on the radio news program GR2, directed by Sergio Zavoli. In 1977, he became a full-time reporter for the daily newspaper Il Giorno (Milan) for a year and a half. After leaving his position there, Gerbi started working as a freelance financial journalist. He ran Il Giorno weekly column about the Milan Stock Exchange for over 15 years, and founded and ran from 1978 to 1987 the lettera SIGE, a monthly publication covering the financial markets. Then, in 1990, came his professional turning point. Gerbi went from covering financial matters to contemporary history, a special area of interest of his which he had not pursued previously. This change happened when Gaetano Scardocchia, then editor of La Stampa, read an essay by Gerbi about the Italian historian Robert S. Lopez at the Voice of America S. Gerbi, Un caso di coscienza: Roberto Lopez alla «Voce dell’America» (1942-1943), in A. Varsori (ed.), Roberto Lopez: l’impegno politico e civile, 1938-1945, Università degli Studi di Firenze, Dipartimento di Storia, Firenze, 1990, pp. 291-322. during the war (subsequently Lopez was a Professor of Medieval History at Yale) and invited Gerbi to write for La Stampa's cultural pages. In 1993, Gerbi moved to another national newspaper, Il Corriere della Sera, until 2000. Then came a nine-year collaboration with Il Sole 24 Ore Sunday cultural supplement, followed by another three years working for Il Corriere again. In 2012 Gerbi officially retired as a journalist to pursue a career only as a book author. In fact, he had already started working in the field of non-fiction when, thirty years earlier, he had edited his father's most famous work, La disputa del Nuovo Mondo (, 1983; reprint Adelphi, 2000),Translation into Spanish: La disputa del Nuevo Mundo, transl. by Antonio Alatorre, Fondo de Cultura Económica, México- Buenos Aires, 1960 e 1982; into English: The Dispute of the New World, transl. by Jeremy Moyle, University of Pittsburgh Press, Pittsburgh 1973 (paperback, 2010); into Portuguese: O Novo Mundo, transl. by Bernardo Joffily, Companhia das Letras, São Paulo 1996. with the support of Franco Venturi and Mario Einaudi, and under the guidance of Gianni Antonini, editorial director at the publishing house Ricciardi. He later worked on more of his father’s works, including monographs and essay collections (see below). Gerbi’s work as an author — which began quite late, at the age of 55 — is characterized by a special passion for extensive archival research: he likes to write biographical essays, and parallel biographies (with two characters examined together). He has a particular interest in fascism and the problems that arise within the relationship between intellectuals and politics, especially in times of dictatorship. He still enjoys writing occasionally about economic and financial history. His books with the publishing house Einaudi include: in 1999, Tempi di malafede (winner of the Comisso Award in 2000),https://www.premiocomisso.it/archivio-premio-letterario-giovanni- comisso/ a story about the thwarted friendship between the writer Guido Piovene and the antifascist philosopher Eugenio Colorni; in 2002, Raffaele Mattioli e il filosofo domato (the “tamed philosopher” being Antonello Gerbi); in 2006 and 2009, together with Raffaele Liucci, a two-volume biography about famous Italian journalist Indro Montanelli; in 2011, an essay called Mattioli e Cuccia. Due banchieri del Novecento. His publications with the publishing house Hoepli include: in 2013, Giovanni Enriques, dalla Olivetti alla Zanichelli (winner of the Biella Award in 2014); in 2016, I Cosattini. Una famiglia antifascista di Udine (winner of the Matteotti Award in 2017). With Hoepli, Gerbi also published a couple of second editions of books previously written, such as Tempi di malafede in 2012 and the Indro Montanelli biography, Raffaele Mattioli e il filosofo domato, in one sole volume in 2017. In 2009 he wrote the banker Antonio Foglia’s (1891-1957) biography, in a private edition. Over this period of time, Gerbi has edited, sometimes in collaboration with other professionals, various collections of essays or of newspaper articles for the publisher Nino Aragno (including works by Enzo Forcella, Alessandro Galante Garrone, Orio Vergani, Bruno Visentini, Antonello Gerbi, Enrico Cuccia, Paolo Baffi, Guido Piovene, Giovanni Malagodi, and Giorgio Ambrosoli). Between 1991 and 2006, Gerbi published several essays in the literary magazine Belfagor, as well as penning various entries for the Dictionary of Fascism (Einaudi, 2005), edited by Sergio Luzzatto and Victoria De Grazia. His autobiographical research on the secularization of the Gerbi family has led to the 2019 publication of his book Ebrei riluttanti (Hoepli), which in 2020 has been translated into English by Jeremy Moyle as Reluctant Jews, published by Centro Primo Levi Editions in New York City. In 1983 Sandro Gerbi married Margherita Dezi, a former teacher from Abruzzi. They have two children: Martina (b. 1984) who is a classical dancer and photographic model, and Antonello (b. 1988), who is a mathematical engineer and holds a PhD in mathematics from the École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne.

The present church, in red brick with stone dressings in a decorated style, was designed by Horace Francis and constructed 1865–1867. The church was listed Grade II in 1981. The church is dedicated to St Mary of the Visitation. A church dedicated to St Mary in Acton was first recorded in 1231. The medieval church was altered and repaired several times over the centuries. In 1642, the church was damaged by Roundhead soldiers after the Battle of Turnham Green: the font was defaced, windows smashed, the chancel rails taken into the street to be burnt, and most of the memorial brasses destroyed. They also set fire to the rectory outbuildings, objecting to the ceremonial practice of the rector, Daniel Featley. Featley, a Calvinist anti-Laudian but a royal chaplain and a defender of the Church of England, twice escaped assassination, and was ejected from the living of Acton in 1643. Featley and his replacement Philip Nye were both members of the Westminster Assembly, Featley arguing for episcopalianism (the existing system of church governance by bishops), Nye arguing for congregationalism (autonomous churches). To meet the needs of a growing local population, the church was remodelled in 1837, then demolished (except the tower) in 1865 and completely rebuilt in 1865–1867. The new church was consecrated on 16 May 1866 by Samuel Wilberforce, Bishop of Oxford. In 1876, the tower was rebuilt, paid for by Frederic Ouvry in memory of his sister, and a new clock was installed. The parish is in the Deanery of Ealing, in the Archdeaconry of Northolt, in the Willesden Episcopal Area of the Diocese of London. Memorials Several memorials survive from the old church, including those to: * Humphrey Cavell (died 1558), a local lawyer who left money for a mass to be said for his soul each week for a year after his burial – a monumental brass. * Anne Southwell (died 1636), poet. * Catherine, Viscountess Conway (died 1639), wife of Edward Conway, 1st Viscount Conway; an extensive investor in New World ventures including the Virginia Company and a local benefactor by her will dated 1637. * Mary Skippon (died 1655), wife of Major-General Philip Skippon , Parliamentarian commander during the Civil War. * John Perryn (died 1656), benefactor. * Philippa Rous (died 1657), wife of Francis Rous , Puritan religious author and Speaker of the House of Commons – her husband's titles were later erased from the monument by royalists. * Elizabeth Barry (died 1713), actress.

Construction and commissioning I-373 was laid down on 13 August 1944 by Yokosuka Navy Yard at Yokosuka, Japan, with the name Submarine No. 2962. On 5 October 1944, she was renamed I-373 and was provisionally attached to the Yokosuka Naval District. She was launched on 30 November 944 and was completed and commissioned on 14 April 1945.

On 16 June 1945, she departed Yokosuka bound for Sasebo. Arriving at Sasebo on 17 June 1945, she began conversion into a tanker submarine capable of carrying 150 metric tons of aviation gasoline in addition to other cargo.

The Blue Angel was co-owned by Herbert Jacoby. The duo, as Her‐Max, Inc.,https://www.nytimes.com/1964/04/29/archives/vaughn-meader-helps-the-blue- angel-comedian-performs-at-insolvent.html invested $5,000 each to open the club. A touch of interior design included a blue cherub--a blue angel--on the stage proscenium. Curt Weinberg acted as publicist. At capacity, the club held 150 people. The kitchen served gourmet food. The Blue Angel was a desegregated club, a rarity for its day. It was one of the venues at which Edith Piaf made one of her first performance appearances in the United States. Singers Irene Sordoni, Mildred Bailey, Mabel Mercer, and pianist Bobby Short performed at the venue in 1945. In 1946, actress, singer, dancer, and impressionist Florence Desmond debuted at the club. Eddie Mayehoff also performed on the bill. Also in 1946, the Navy Flight Demonstration Squadron visited the club, prompting them to rename themselves the Blue Angels.https://dixiesunnews.com/news/articles/2012/03/21/angels-fly-over- southern-utah/ Other legendary names of the day, such as Eartha Kitt, Anita Ellis, and Alice Ghostley performed there; Kitt undertook a number of residencies at the club, including an eight-week stint in 1952 and an unprecedented 20-week run. Other stars appearing at the club included Pearl Bailey, Alice Pearce, Paula Laurence, and the Bernard Brothers. In 1951, comedian Dorothy \\"Dot\\" Greener played the club, with the King Odom Quartet and The Mademoiselles on the same bill. Throughout the 1950s, pianist Jimmy Lyon led a jazz trio at the club as well as provided piano accompaniment for all performers who brought their acts there, while Bart Howard, composer of \\"Fly Me to the Moon,\\" played piano there as well, also acting as the club's \\"master of ceremonies,\\" or director of shows, throughout the decade; \\"Fly Me to the Moon\\" is said to have debuted at the Angel in 1954, as sung by Felicia Sanders.

In an attempt to help save it, comedian Vaughn Meader, who got his start at the Angel, held a show there and only accepted union wages so the show revenue could go directly to keeping the club afloat; he even considered buying the club but came to the realization that he could not afford it. The club closed in 1964 as the emergence of rock 'n' roll made the club's jazz scene less relevant. Similarly, the popularity of television was \\"making serious inroads on the talent pool available to nightclubs,\\" hence affecting business at the Angel.

It depicts a fictional scene of a man on a dromedary struggling to fend off an attack by a Barbary lion. The diorama was created for the Paris Exposition of 1867 and subsequently shown at the American Museum of Natural History, Centennial Exposition, and the Carnegie Museum of Natural History. As part of a 2017 restoration, the museum found human remains in the diorama. In 2020, the diorama was removed from view in response to the Black Lives Matter movement. History Lion Attacking a Dromedary was created by French taxidermist Édouard Verreaux, part of Maison Verreaux. The diorama is based on Arab Horseman Killing a Boar and The Tiger Hunt by French sculptor Antoine-Louis Barye. In the creation of the work, Verreaux used bones and skins to form the stuffed dromedary and two stuffed lions. The human figure was made mostly of plaster. Lion Attacking a Dromedary was first displayed at the Paris Exposition of 1867 where it won a gold medal. After the death of Verreaux in 1867, Lion Attacking a Dromedary was sold to the American Museum of Natural History and shown at the 1876 Centennial Exposition. In 1898, it was sold to the Carnegie Museum of Natural History for $50 (). The work was considered to be \\"too theatrical\\" to be displayed at the American Museum of Natural History. The next year, Frederick Webster restored the diorama and it was put on display. In 2016, Lion Attacking a Dromedary was restored by the museum. As part of the restoration, the museum conducted tests on the animals using X-rays and DNA analysis techniques of the taxidermied animals to determine if they were genuine. Verreaux was known to fake records to inflate the selling price of his dioramas. The human figure was determined to be mostly synthetic, but, to the surprise of the museum, the head contained a human skull. Previously, it was thought that the human figure was only made of plaster. It is unknown who the skull belongs to or where Verreaux collected the skull from. In January 2017, the diorama went back on display in the foyer of the museum, previously it was in the hall of North African mammals, and the name was changed from Arab Courier Attacked by Lions to Lion Attacking a Dromedary. As a part of the unveiling, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History hosted a symposium about the restoration, the diorama, and its misrepresentation of North Africa. In July 2020, the Carnegie Museum of Natural History removed Lion Attacking a Dromedary from view citing the Black Lives Matter movement and the lack of accuracy. The museum is considering moving the diorama to a part of the museum where it can be avoided. Depiction Lion Attacking a Dromedary was created to celebrate the French colonial empire and uses orientalist tropes. The diorama is inaccurate both scientifically and anthropologically and is considered to be a work of fiction. Anthropologists, zoologists, and museum studies commentators have been critical of the piece since the 1890s. The Smithsonian Institution questioned the propriety of showing such a sensationalist diorama in 1892. Lion Attacking a Dromedary was removed from the American Museum of Natural History in 1898 and considered destroying it because the museum felt that the diorama was \\"too emotional and distracting for educational purposes.\\" Frederic Augustus Lucas defended Lion Attacking a Dromedary in 1914 from criticism of being overly theatrical by pointing out that by being theatrical the piece was interesting and drew the attention of museum patrons. By 2002, the diorama was seen as an example of \\"danger, excitement, and exoticism\\" of the other in orientalist works and was compared to a \\"sideshow attraction.\\" Despite this, Lion Attacking a Dromedary is considered to be Verreaux's masterpiece by journalist Miquel Molina in an article in Pula: Botswana Journal of African Studies. Lion Attacking a Dromedary is a taxidermied diorama. It appears, to the viewer, as a frozen moment in time that could be reanimated momentarily. It depicts an imagined violent scene; a North African courier on a dromedary struggling for his life. The camel is bellowing in pain as a male Barbary lion is trying to climb up it to reach the courier who is attempting to stab the lion with his saber. The body of a female lion lies in front of the camel. The male figure, referred to as an Arab by Verreaux, is a fictional pastiche of five North African cultures and is based on what Verreaux thought an Arab looked like.

The red text reads Ci comense le prologue que maistre Johan d'Anthioche fist (\\"Here begins the prologue that Master John of Antioch made\\"). John of Antioch, also known as Harent of Antioch, was a 13th-century Old French writer of Outremer who made important translations from Latin. He translated Cicero, Boethius, the Otia imperialia and possibly the rule of the Knights Hospitaller. His original writing consists of an epilogue to Cicero and some additional chapters appended to the Otia. Life John was born in Antioch to a family of western European origin. There is no evidence that he ever attended university. He lived in Antioch before its conquest by the Mamlūks in 1268, after which he moved to Acre. He was attached to the Knights Hospitaller, probably as a priest at the main hospital in Acre. Some Italianisms in his translations suggest that his first language was Italian rather than French. Works At the request of fellow Hospitaller William of Santo Stefano, John translated Cicero's De inventione and the anonymous Rhetorica ad Herennium. At the time these works were considered two part of a singular work of Cicero's on rhetoric. John's translation thus came under the title Rectorique de Marc Tulles Cyceron. It was completed at Acre in 1282. The manuscript presented to William—now Chantilly, Musée Condé, MS fr. 433 (590)—also contains a preface, an epilogue on the methodology of translation and treatise of logic. These parts may also have been completed at Acre in 1282 or perhaps a little later in Cyprus. The preface and the treatise on logic are in a different hand from the rest of the manuscript, which is probably in John's hand. The epilogue was written by John (and thus probably at Acre in 1282). The treatise on logic consists of excerpts from Boethius' De topicis differentiis, most likely translated but probably not selected by John. The inspiration for William's request came from his native Lombardy, where vernacular Italian translations of De inventione and Rhetorica ad Herennium had been produced by Brunetto Latini and Guidotto da Bologna, respectively. John also translated Gervase of Tilbury's Otia imperialia from Latin into Old French. This translation, now in Paris, Bibliothèque nationale de France, MS fr. 9113, is ascribed to \\"maystre Harent d'Antioche\\". Although doubt has been cast on the identity of this person with John, the Chantilly manuscript refers to the translator of the Rectorique as \\"Johan d’Anthioche, que l'en apele de Harens\\" (\\"who is called Harent\\") and there is no reason to doubt that they are one and the same. To Gervase's Otia he added five chapters of original material in Old French. In these he provides some of the best evidence that he was a man of the church, including several accounts of miracles. Gaston Paris placed the production of the translation of the Otia at Acre before 1287, and in one place precisely in 1285, but it is not certain it was made at Acre. The influence of Brunetto Latini's Livres dou trésor is apparent in John's addenda to the Otia. These five additional chapters rely heavily on chapters 82–98 of the first book of Brunetto's Trésor as completed after 1266. These contain references to Emperor Frederick II and King Manfred of Sicily, and permit John to extend Gervase's list of rulers of the Holy Roman Empire down to his own time. John may also be behind the Old French translation of the Hospitaller rule and of certain documents from the Hospitaller archives in Acre initiated by William of Santo Stefano and undertaken between 1278 and 1283. Methodology John's translations were pioneering. Only about ten Old French translations of classical writers are known down to John's time. His Rectorique may be among the two or three earliest earliest true translations, rather than adaptations, from Latin into Old French. It was the first such translation on rhetoric other than a few passages of Brunetto Latini's Trésor. The translation of De topicis differentiis is \\"one of the first vernacular [European] texts in logic\\". The significance of this translation lies in the fact that leading contemporary opinion, as expressed by no less than Roger Bacon, was that logic could not be adequately expressed in vernacular languages. Indeed, John had to create new words to translate Boethius, such as entimeme for enthymeme, a word not otherwise attested in medieval French. In his epilogue on translation, John describes the difference between translating by word and by sense: > ... the manner of speaking in Latin is not generally the same as that of > French. Neither the properties of words nor the methods of arranging > arguments and words in Latin are the same as those of French. And that is > [so] generally in every language. Because every language has its own > properties and its manner of speaking. ... For that reason it was useful for > the translator of this science to translate sometimes word for word, and > sometimes and more frequently sentence for sentence, and sometimes because > of the great obscurity of a sentence to add to it and lengthen it. Although the ad verbum (by word) and ad sensum (by sense) distinction was ancient, John's phrase maniere de parler (manner of speaking) has an exact equivalent in Philip of Tripoli's prologue to his translation of the Arabic Secret of Secrets into Latin, which was made in Outremer and where Philip speaks of the differing loquendi modus (way of speaking) between Arabic and Latin. Some of John's emendations that appear in the Rectorique suggest the influence of Donatus.

His writings include Insulae Melitae Descriptio (1536), the earliest known detailed description of the Maltese Islands, which also contains the earliest known printed map of the archipelago. Biography Jean Quintin was born in Autun, France on 20 January 1500, and he was the son of Philibert Quentin and Philiberta Laborault. He became a Roman Catholic priest and he joined the Order of St John, becoming a chaplain of the Langue of France and Secretary to the Grand Master. He was also a Professor of Canon Law at the University of Paris. Quintin wrote on various subjects, including geography and cosmography. In 1536, he published Insulae Melitae Descriptio, a description of the Maltese Islands which he had written after visiting Malta in 1530. In 1540, he published Tractatus de ventis, et nautica buxula ventorum indice in Paris. Quintin died on 9 April 1561, and he was buried at the in Paris. Insulae Melitae Descriptio Insulae Melitae Descriptio is an eighteen-page-long description of the Maltese Islands written in Latin. It is dated 20 January 1533 and it was published in Lyon in 1536. It is notable for being the earliest known detailed description of Malta, and for its influence on later literature about the islands. The work is an original eyewitness account, but it also draws from classical Roman sources along with local medieval traditions such as that which states that St Paul's shipwreck as recounted in the Acts of the Apostles took place in Malta. The work included a woodcut map of Malta which is the earliest known printed map of the archipelago. The map is primitive but it depicts the islands' main characteristics fairly well, and it is likely to have been made by Quintin himself. The text of Insulae Melitae Descriptio was edited seven times and it was later partially translated into Italian four times. An English translation by Horatio C. R. Vella was published in 1980, and it was included along with an annotated version of the original Latin text in an edition entitled The Earliest Description of Malta (Lyons 1536) by Jean Quintin D'Autun.

The previous DIE 21 had been part of Army Corps 2 (Seville) and had had its headquarters at Algeciras, including Agrupación de infantería (AIs) at Sevilla (AI \\"Soria\\" 9); AI \\"Extremadura\\" 15 (Algeciras); AI Pavía 19 (San Roque); AI Álava 22 (Tarifa); and AI \\"Granada\\" 34 (Huelva), plus Agrupación Blindada Sagunto No. 7 (Cavalry Group No. 7 \\"Sagunto\\", located at Seville); RACA 14 at Seville; and battalions of sappers and signallers at Cadiz. With the Francoist reorganisation of 1965, the army was divided into two parts, the Immediate Intervention Forces (FII) and the territorial defence forces. The FII were to be a \\"an army corps equipped and trained for conventional and limited nuclear warfare, ready to be deployed within or outside national borders.\\" Three divisions were created as the spearhead of the Immediate Intervention Forces: Armoured Division No. 1 \\"Brunete\\", Mechanised Division No. 2 \\"Guzman el Bueno\\"; and Motorised Division \\"Maestrazgo\\" No. 3 with its headquarters in Valencia.

Washburn (1868 – October 1932) was an American sculptor. Deaf from age sixteen, Washburn studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and built a successful career creating sculptures and medallions. Her most significant work is a 1909 bust of Charles Burlingame Waite, located at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. Early life and education Mary Washburn was born in Star City, Indiana, in 1868, and grew up in Rensselaer, Indiana. She was deafened after a bout of scarlet fever at age sixteen. Washburn returned to her public high school and graduated with her class. She attended Butler College in Indianapolis through her sophomore year in 1889. She struggled to adjust to college life and communicate with teachers and other students; she took lessons in lipreading and learned to use her residual hearing to the best of her ability. Art education and career Washburn took courses in drawing and commercial art in Cincinnati, then moved to Chicago. After traveling to Europe to study artistic classics, she began attending the Art Institute of Chicago. At the Art Institute, she studied under Lorado Taft and Charles Mulligan. She spent many evenings practicing anatomy drawings in the library and sketching skeletons and musculature models in the art studios. Her first commissioned work was a sculpture of Union Civil War general Robert H. Milroy in her hometown of Rensselaer; the statue stands at the former site of his homestead. Many exhibits followed at the Art Institute and at exhibitions in Chicago, Indianapolis, Philadelphia, and other cities. Washburn decided to resign from taking commercial art orders so she could focus on sculpture. Washburn created the Waite Memorial for Charles Burlingame Waite and Catharine Van Valkenburg Waite after his death in 1909. Located at Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C., the memorial features a bronze bust of Charles and a circular bronze relief portrait of Catharine. During a third visit to Paris, Washburn studied under master sculptor Edwin Sawyer, learning to sculpt medals and medallions. One of her sketches was accepted at the Old Salon of Paris in 1913, and she exhibited her works at the Paris Allied Artists Association. At the 1915 Panama–Pacific International Exposition, Washburn received an award. She also exhibited at the Oakland Art Gallery in 1927. Her artwork can be found in multiple institutions across the United States, including the Carnegie Institute. She died in October 1932.

Her husband, Sooraj S Kumar (27), was arrested. Later, he confessed to the public media that he purchased a cobra, and introduced the snake into their home, with the intention of killing his wife. Incident  Uthra was a young housewife, who had been married for two years, and was the mother of a one-year-old son. She was found unconscious, in her bedroom in her parent's home, when her mother came to call her in morning. It appeared that she had been bitten by a snake, during the night of 6 May, 2020. Uthra died the next day, 7 May 2020. A large black cobra was found in the bedroom that she shared with her husband. At the time, Uthra was recovering from a previous Russell's viper bite, inflicted on March 2, two months prior, at her husband's home and was living in her parent's home during her recovery. Her parents stated that because the married couple were sleeping in an air- conditioned room, it would have it difficult for the cobra to enter without being detected. Prior to her death, \\"She wasn’t able to walk, was in a bed- ridden situation for 52 days and had to undergo a plastic surgery after getting bitten by the viper. Making her get bitten again with a more venomous snake while she had still not recovered from the earlier attempt amounts to brutal murder only,” stated Crime Branch Deputy Superintendent of Police, A Ashokan The officer who had led the investigation. Complaint One week after his daughter's death, Uthra’s father approached police, stating that he suspected foul play in his daughter’s death. He filed a complaint on 21 May to Kerala Police calling it an unnatural death. According to Uthra's mother, her daughter and Sooraj went to bed after dinner. The next morning Sooraj, usually a late riser, woke up unusually early and went outside. However, Uthra didn't wake up at her usual time. Her mother went into her room, and found that Uthra was unconscious. Later the room was searched, and the cobra was discovered. Sooraj and Uthra's brother killed the snake inside the room. Noted snake expert, Vava Suresh was consulted by police, after her death. Vava Suresh stated, concerning the first snakebite incident, that a Russell's viper would have been unable to reach the second story room in her husband's home, where Uthra received the first snake bite. In regards to the second, fatal bite, Vava Suresh noted that it would have been difficult for the cobra to enter the air-conditioned room at Uthra's parent's home, unaided. He also stated that the cobra may have been \\"hurt\\", as a means of forcing it to bite the sleeping woman. Later, Sooraj confessed that he had caused the cobra, to starve for eleven days, with the intention of ensuring that the cobra would bite his wife. From April 24 to May 6, the snake \\"was kept in a bottle without being fed\\". Afterwards, Sooraj's parents supported their son's innocence in Uthra's death. However, Uthra had already informed her parents about Sooraj's expertise in handling poisonous snakes. Prior to her death from the cobra bite, Uthra had been recently been bitten by a viper. The two incidents caused police to suspect Sooraj's involvement in this case. Discovery and arrests The police arrested the victim's husband, Sooraj, as the prime suspect and also arrested the snake catcher Chavarukavu Suresh Kumar (not to be confused with the snake expert Vava Suresh) as a second suspect in the case. On 12th July 2020, Sooraj made a public confession about the murder. He stated that he bought two snakes for ₹10,000 each, (US $135) from the snake catcher Chavarukavu Suresh Kumar. The investigating team has reported that Uthra was attacked twice, first with a viper and then with a cobra. The viper bite caused her to be completely bed-ridden for around 52 days and had she had to undergo plastic surgery to repair the damage. The Kerala police's special investigation team (SIT) stated that in this murder case, Sooraj will be the primary person accused and that another case will be registered against him, his mother, father and sister for domestic violence and destroying evidence. The State Women's Commission also urged the police to arrest the family members. Sooraj was booked under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, for murder, attempted murder, attempted permanent injury and destruction of evidence. In early June, 2020 Uthra's father-in-law, Surendran Panicker (59) was arrested, on charges of charges of destroying evidence and hiding 38 sovereign of gold jewelry, which Police discovered buried in a nearby rubber plantation. Uthra's parents stated that the majority of her dowry was still missing. In August, 2020, both the mother and sister of Sooraj, were arrested on charges of conspiracy, domestic violence and destruction of evidence. The charges include \\"sections 498A (Husband or relative of husband of a woman subjecting her to cruelty), 406 (Punishment for criminal breach of trust), 201 (Causing disappearance of evidence of offence, or giving false information to screen offender) and 34 (Acts done by several persons in furtherance of common intention) \\". Forensic evidence According to the police, Sooraj has admitted that he gave sleep-inducing pills to his wife to sedate her, before releasing the snake. On 26 May 2020, Kerala Police sent the carcass of the cobra for forensic examination. The cobra was 80 cm long, and capable of inflicting a fatal bite on a human. Kerala DGP Loknath Behra said that in this peculiar case, investigation will be carried out in a scientific manner by conducting a DNA test of a dead snake. Motive A private bank employee, Sooraj S Kumar is said to have planned the murder by watching snake handling videos on the internet and received training to handle venomous snakes. His motive was to take ownership of his wife's dowry in gold,and also of her life insurance policy. Uthra's father said that previously, \\"he had gifted over 100 sovereigns of gold and a new car\\" to Sooraj and his family, in addition to ₹10 lakh cash.

The case is notable as a statement of principle for sentencing discretion in Australian Criminal Law. Specifically, the case elaborates upon five types of errors that may lead to an appellate court exercising its own sentencing discretion in substitution for that of the sentencing judge. While House was a criminal case, its statement of principle regarding appeals of discretion is relevant to all areas of law.Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [25] House v The King has the 5th highest number of citations among High Court cases.  Facts  Everard Henry House, a bankrupt, was ordered to apply for his discharge by the Federal Court of Bankruptcy. When the application was heard by the court, he was charged with offenses under the Bankruptcy Act 1924. The court had found that six months prior to House's petition in bankruptcy he had pawned unpaid property obtained on credit. The presiding judge Lukin J sentenced House to three months imprisonment with hard labour. House sought appeal to the High Court on the ground that the sentence was excessive.House v The King, 55 CLR 500  Judgement  The majority judgement of Dixon, Evatt, and McTiernan JJ began with a brief recitation of the facts. They then stated legal principle regarding appeals of sentences writing: > '... the judgment complained of, namely, sentence to a term of imprisonment, > depends upon the exercise of a judicial discretion by the court imposing it. > The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be > determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the > judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the > position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It > must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If > the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant > matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not > take into account some material consideration, then his determination should > be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in > substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear > how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if > upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may > infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the > discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a > case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise > of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in > fact occurred.' House v The King, 55 CLR 505 Applying this statement of principle, the majority declined to interfere with the sentence imposed upon Mr House. His appeal was therefore dismissed. This statement of legal principle is the most cited passage of the High Court in its history.Citation statistics are visible at the Jade.io link: here  Significance  The joint majority judgement gave rise to what is sometimes referred to as the 'House errors'. Those errors are still used to determine whether appellate courts ought interfere with lower court sentencing. Briefly stated, the five errors derived from the judgement are whether the lower court judge:https://chrisnowlan.com/house.pdf # Acted on a wrong principle # Was guided by extraneous or irrelevant facts # Mistook the facts # Failed to take into account a material consideration # Imposed a sentence manifestly unreasonable, or plainly unjust The law regarding appeals of sentences has developed in complexity since House v. The King. The majority's statement of principle is not limited to criminal appeals, but applies to any appeal calling for a review of discretion.https://law.unimelb.edu.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0008/2501189/Edmonds-412-Advance.pdf E.g. discretion exercised by public servants is reviewable on House grounds (excluding any effect of privative clauses).

She participated in the blockade of Naples in 1815 with the result that her officers and crew received a great deal of prize money for its fall. She was broken up in 1816. Career Commander William Foote commissioned Partridge in September 1809. She escorted a convoy to the West Indies on 26 October 1810. In October 1810 Commander J. M. Ayde assumed command of Partridge. When news of the outbreak of the War of 1812 reached Britain, the Royal Navy seized all American vessels then in British ports. Partridge was among the Royal Navy vessels then lying at Spithead or Portsmouth and so entitled to share in the grant for the American ships Belleville, Janus, Aeos, Ganges and Leonidas seized there on 31 July 1812. In 1813 and 1815 Partridge served in the Mediterranean. On 18 July 1813, while off Manfredonia, and Partridge attacked a small convoy and captured or destroyed all the vessels. They captured one Neapolitan gunboat armed with one 18-pounder gun, and burnt another. They also destroyed a pinnace armed with one 6-pounder gun. Lastly, they captured two trabaccolos armed with three guns each and laden with salt, and destroyed two others of the same strength and cargo. On 24 July Partridge captured the Guisto Benfattore, Le Gere, and Desegno. On 6 November 1813 Partridge recaptured London Packet, Holman, master.

Plot Stanley Smith, a Soviet agent and explosives expert, prepares at \\"Little Chicago\\" outside Moscow for an undercover assignment. He is then transported by submarine to the coast of Florida. At the \\"Forbidden Area\\" within the Pentagon, the \\"intentions of the enemy group\\" plans to defend a Soviet nuclear attack. The group includes Clark Simmons, the senior member, Col. Jesse Price, the newest member, and Katharine Hume, the secretary. Price discloses plans for a new program of automatic retaliation using ICBMs with pre-set targeting. Intelligence reports report a possible submarine-based Soviet nuclear attack. Five American B-99 long-range bombers disappear suddenly from radar. General Keaton leads the investigation, and a survivor mumbles about coffee. Smith has secured a post in the Air Force, serving at a kitchen on an air base in Florida. He conceal pressure bombs, set to explode at 25,000 feet, in coffee thermoses used by the airmen. Smith murders a cook after his Russian tooth filling is noticed. Price believes the enemy seeks to have the B-99s grounded in order to open a window to attack while the American retaliatory ability is ineffective. He concludes the Soviet attack is coming on Christmas Eve. Simmons rejects Price's prediction as a fairy tale. A fleet of 600 Soviet submarines approaches as America is \\"busy with its Christmas trees.\\" Hume professes her love for Price and urges him to flee with her. Price instead flies to Florida to brief Gen. Keaton. Keaton reverses the grounding the B-99s and boards one as the crew searches for the pressure bomb. Price becomes suspicious when Smith seeks to retrieve a coffee thermos from the control tower. He learns that the canisters also explode when opened and warns Keaton, who is about to open a thermos, that it contains a bomb. Smith is given truth serum, and American air and naval forces destroy the Soviet submarines as they approach the coast. The President addresses the country and reports that the country's bombers are approaching the Soviet Union. The Soviet Presidium resigns, and the new Soviet Premier agrees to withdraw its naval forces and ground its air forces. Keaton urges the President to continue with the retaliatory strike, but the President orders the return of the American bombers.

Production In May 1956, Martin Manulis, producer of a new CBS series, Playhouse 90, announced he had acquired television rights to Pat Frank's novel Forbidden Area. CBS later announced that Forbidden Area, with the story adaptation for television by Rod Serling, would air as the premiere installment of Playhouse 90. Manulis had previously produced the Climax! series and brought director John Frankenheimer with him from that series. Frankenheimer was tabbed to direct Forbidden Area. Manulis also assembled an all-star cast for Forbidden Area, including Charlton Heston, Tab Hunter, and Vincent Price. He noted that Hunter, who usually played a hero, was cast against type playing a villain. Rehearsals began during the week of September 16. The aspect of Forbidden Area that fascinated Manulis was the idea that the Russians had developed an American town in the heart of Russia where future spies were immersed in American culture, speaking only English, and following baseball. Manulis hired teen idol Hunter to play a young Russian training in the spy village. The production was staged on October 4, 1956, at CBS Television City in Los Angeles. The program opened with host Jack Palance announcing that it was \\"opening night\\" as television took a \\"giant step\\" with an important new series of 90-minute dramas performed each week. Forbidden Area was the first installment in the four-year run of the series.(four-year run)(season one, episode one) Playhouse 90 was voted \\"the greatest television series of all time\\" in a 1970 poll of television editors. Reception In The New York Times, Jack Gould wrote that the production \\"ran the gamut of hokum\\" and employed \\"every cliche in the book of elementary video dramaturgy.\\" The Washington Post called it a \\"superb production... brilliantly produced\\" in which Hunter was \\"splendid.\\" John Crosby of the New York Herald Tribune wrote that the production, depicting Russia on the march with planes and submarines, \\"all groaning with hydrogen bombs, intent on knocking out this country\\", had its moments \\"as a thriller.\\" Crosby also praised John Frankenheimer's skill in jumping back and forth between the Pentagon and the saboteurs. However, he found that the script was \\"slipshod\\" and that the production suffered from \\"grave weaknesses\\" as a drama. Hunter said, \\"I got good notices for my performance but critics were lukewarm overall. It was the following week's installment... Requiem for a Heavyweight that scored the knockout\\".

Life  Born in Cologne, Pollini came from a strictly Jewish family living in very modest circumstances and was actually called Baruch Pohl. He attended grammar school and then worked for a merchant before he made his debut in 1857 in his native town as Lord Arturo Talbo in the opera I puritani by Bellini. He changed to baritone and in the autumn of 1865, he joined an Italian opera company of which he became impresario. This was the beginning of his career as one of the most important opera directors of his time. He sang at the and in the years 1860 and 1861 at the Latvian National Opera. In 1864, he became director of the Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet and then went to St Petersburg and Moscow for a few years, where he was chief impresario of the Italian Opera. In 1874, he became director of the Hamburg State Opera and from 1876, he also directed the Altonaer Theater and from 1894 also the Thalia Theater. Four times a week, he presented opera, twice drama, once operetta or ballet and was so successful that he achieved full houses and handsome surpluses. He brought 175 premieres, 51 of which were world premieres, to the stage and continued his work as opera director until his death. He engaged important singers and conductors, to whom he paid high fees, to the Hamburg Opera and thus brought it to a high artistic level. Well- known composers such as Puccini and Tchaikovsky were engaged to conduct their own works and, in 1891, Pollini appointed Gustav Mahler as successor to Hans von Bülow as first Kapellmeister at his house. Together with him, he organised a guest performance of his ensemble at the Covent Garden Opera in London, where Richard Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung and other operas were performed under Mahler's direction. In 1888, he became a citizen of Hamburg and was granted the right by the Senate to bear the artist name Pollini. In 1894, Pollini married the soprano Bianca Bianchi, who, from then on, sang as primadonna in Hamburg. Other important singers that Pollini brought to Hamburg included Albert Niemann (tenor), Katharina Klafsky and Anna von Mildenburg. Immediately after a Meistersinger performance, Pollini died of heart paralysis.Bernhard Pollini on Wikisource He was 58 of age.  Trivia  Pollini made no compromises in the pursuit of his goals as opera director and pushed Gustav Mahler, for example, to the limits of his capabilities. In the 1894/95 season, Mahler conducted 126 evenings at the Stadt-Theater and a further 23 in Altona, and took over the direction of subscription concerts for the late Hans von Bülow.Gustav Mahler lived at Bundesstraße 10, article in Die Welt date 13 October 2011, retrieved 20 September 2020 A permanent war between Mahler and Pollini was the result,google.at/books? id=nBMpxw5c3cUC&pg;=PA23&lpg;=PA23&dq;=Bernhard+Pollini+Gustav+Mahler&source;=bl&ots;=DqiQxiJ7oj&sig;=N65lYqG9nlu8UcfoVM3GIgC335M&hl;=de&sa;=X&ei;=ZXLwU_6HBMbb7Abug4GIBg&ved;=0CCsQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&q;=Bernhard%20Pollini%20Gustav%20Mahler&f;=false \\"Gustav Mahler\\" by Constantin Floros, on GoogleBooks retrieved 20 September 2020 until they separated a few months before Pollini's death in 1897.Bernhard Pollini auf Das Jüdische Hamburg retrieved 20 September 2020 In 1877, the enterprising Pollini negotiated with Richard Wagner for the performance rights to Die Walküre, which was considered the most popular opera in the Ring cycle, but Wagner was not permitted to do so. The impresario thereupon negotiated with Wagner for the entire cycle, but insisted on starting with \\"Die Walküre\\". Wagner resigned and twice gave Pollini the advice to perform the cycle in the intended order for better understanding. Pollini did not heed this advice and so the cyclus began on 30 March 1878 with the premiere of the Walküre.

Rod Serling wrote the teleplay, and John Frankenheimer directed. Rod Steiger and William Shatner starred. Serling originally wrote the story about the lynching of a young African-American in the Southern United States. Due to objections from the program's commercial sponsors, who were concerned with offending white Southern viewers, it was not produced and aired until Serling moved the story's setting out of the South and changed the victim from black to Mexican. Plot The production opens with a reporter, Hennify (played by James Gregory), dictating the story of a lynching to be wired back to his newspaper in St. Louis. The teleplay then flashes back with Hennify serving as the narrator. Pancho Rivera, a 19-year-old Mexican boy, is jailed in Dempseyville, a small southwestern town suffering from drought and heat. Pancho is charged with attempted robbery of the general store and assault on the wife of the shopkeeper, Jerry Paul (played by William Shatner). Paul leads a mob to the jail. Rather than defend Pancho from the mob, the sheriff, Harvey Denton (played by Rod Steiger), turns Rivera over to the mob. Pancho is hanged. The mob celebrates at the saloon after the lynching. Hennify confronts Paul and Denton. He asks what the penalty would have been if Rivera had been convicted rather than lynched. Hennify is told the penalty would have been five to ten years in prison. The next day, Hennify visits Paul's store. Hennify observes a mark on the face of Paul's wife, Annamay (played by Fay Spain), and notes that the mark matches the ring on Paul's hand. After Hennify leaves, Annamay accuses Paul of killing an innocent boy. Paul warns her not to damage his good name and throws her to the ground. Denton enters the store and confronts Paul with his suspicion that Paul killed Pancho. Denton suspects that Annamay was in love with Pancho. The town's Mexican residents stop patronizing Paul's store. They stand in silent protest outside the store. Paul taunts Pancho's brother, Ramon, challenging him to enter the segregated saloon. Ramon enters the saloon and strikes Paul three times with a whip. Paul stirs up the white patrons by blaming the Mexicans for the town's problems. He again leads a mob to the jail, demanding that Ramon be turned over. This time, Denton refuses and speaks to the mob. Annamay appears and tells the mob that she loved Pancho and that was why Paul killed Pancho. Paul and Denton exchange gunfire. Denton is wounded, and Paul is killed. Denton tells the priest that there is no absolution for him or for the mob. He confesses that he led a mob 16 years earlier that killed an elderly man. Denton then collapses and dies. That night, the drought that has plagued Dempseyville ends as rain begins to fall. Hennify writes that the rain came too late, because the town had already turned to dust due to prejudice and violence. Cast The following performers received screen credit for their performances:Kinescope of \\"A Town Has Turned to Dust\\", aired June 19, 1958.

Production Martin Manulis was the producer, and John Frankenheimer directed. Rod Serling wrote the teleplay. The production was broadcast live on June 19, 1958, from Television City in Los Angeles. It was part of the second season of Playhouse 90, an anthology television series that was voted \\"the greatest television series of all time\\" in a 1970 poll of television editors. The production received three nominations for the 11th Primetime Emmy Awards: Frankenheimer for best direction of a single dramatic program, one hour or longer; Serling for best writing of a single dramatic program, one hour or longer; and Rod Steiger for best single performance by an actor. Serling's teleplay was remade in 1998 as a science fiction film for the Sci-Fi Channel. =Censorship= Serling originally wrote the story about lynching in the Southern United States based on the killing of Emmett Till in particular.{\\"It was supposed to be what happened to the men who killed Emmett Till . . . Then the sponsors told the network they Would not sponsor it. We had to rewrite it as a western.\\") Concerned with offending white viewers in the South, the program's commercial sponsors were unwilling to tackle Southern racism.(\\"According to Serling, his June 1957 concept was rejected by the sponsors. 'Manulis promised he would buck my play through the opposition that could be expected from the six sponsors Playhouse 90 bad at the time,' Serling remembered in 1960, 'but they ganged up on him. We never bad a chance to carry out the original concept\\") Serling was only able to have the story told by switching the time to the late 19th century, the setting to the southwest, and the victim to a Mexican. Serling recalled: > By the time A Town Has Turned to Dust went before the cameras my script had > turned to dust . . . Emmett Till became a romantic Mexican who loved the > storekeeper's wife, but 'only with his eye.' . . . The setting was moved to > the Southwest in the 1870's . . . The phrase 'twenty men in hoods' became > 'twenty men in homemade masks.' They chopped it up like a roomful of > butchers at work on a steer.} Despite the compromises, Serling biographer Nicholas Parisi observed, \\"the true target\\" of Serling's contempt \\"could hardly have been clearer\\" than in Sheriff Denton's reply when the mob's leader claims the Mexicans \\"need to be taught a lesson\\". In particular, Denton replied: > That's all they've had for a hundred years is a lesson! We've been the > teacher. We taught 'em to turn their cheeks, we taught 'em to bow their > heads, we taught 'em to say 'yessir.' . . . That's all they've ever had is a > lesson! Now, what is left to teach 'em? How to stop breathing in a noose? Another sponsor, Prudential Insurance Co., objected to the original ending of the story in which Sheriff Denton committed suicide. The ending was therefore changed so that Denton died from a gunshot wound. Reception In The New York Times, Jack Gould called it \\"powerful drama\\" and \\"a raw, tough and at the same time deeply moving outcry against prejudice.\\" He praised Serling's \\"vivid dialogue, Frankenheimer's \\"simply superb\\" direction, and the \\"superlative\\" performances of Steiger and Shatner. William Ewald of the UPI called it \\"a play with good bones\\", \\"plenty of meat\\", and \\"dialogue that swirled.\\" However, he felt that production was not wholly successful because the portrayals were \\"too black and white\\". In The Boston Globe, Elizabeth W. Driscoll called it \\"a taut 90 minutes of live-from-Hollywood theatre.\\" Bill Fiset of the Oakland Tribune wrote that its tackling of racial intolerance made it \\"a milestone for television\\" and \\"one of the meatiest dramas the program has ever presented\\" -- not \\"meek or sterile\\" like so much television drama. He also credited strong acting by Steiger and Shatner and excellent direction.

ChilledCow runs 24/7 live streams that play lo-fi hip hop songs accompanied by a GIF of an anime girl either studying or relaxing, created by Juan Pablo Machado. The first and most notable live stream is a live stream meant for people to listen while studying. The songs used in the live streams have either been released through the ChilledCow label or have been given permission by the artist to use the song in the live stream.  Formation  The YouTube channel was started by Dimitri on March 23, 2015. ChilledCow started streaming lo-fi hip hop songs meant for people to listen while studying on February 25, 2017. The live stream was originally accompanied by a GIF that was taken from the Studio Ghibli film, Whisper of the Heart, of a young woman studying. The stream received a copyright strike from YouTube between July and August 2017 and was replaced by an original anime girl studying. The GIF was designed by a college student studying art, Juan Pablo Machado.  Copyright issues  The live stream was originally taken down by YouTube for using footage of a young woman studying from the film, Whisper of the Heart. The live stream was reinstated after Dimitri worked with a college student, Machado, to design a new GIF of a girl studying to use for the live stream. The music used in ChilledCow's live streams were either released through the ChilledCow label or were given permission to use by another artist. Despite that, on February 22, 2020, ChilledCow announced that its channel was taken down for potentially violating YouTube's Terms of Service, and demanded a reason why. He was backed up by many supporters and the loss of the channel was mourned by many. YouTube responded the next day by tweeting an apology, saying it was a mistake and reinstated ChilledCow's channel. The original live stream that was stopped by the take down was 13,000 hours long, making it one of the longest videos on YouTube.  Critical reception  ChilledCow's live streams have received generally positive reviews from listeners, usually about the live stream meant for studying. ChilledCow's viewership has grown ever since the start of the live stream. Farield El Gafy from Washington Square News praised the live stream about studying, saying \\"Thanks to this playlist, I’ve cranked out a multitude of essays, study sessions, scripts and rough cuts to the tune of pop culture samples, muted snares and artificial record scratches.\\" Xavier Piedra of Mashable praised for its relaxing songs that keep the listener focused. He also noted that the playlist is updated frequently and often contains a mixture of old and newly added songs. The live stream was the first live stream listed on Cassidy Quinn of KGW's \\"Top 10 non-news live channels to watch on YouTube while social distancing\\". Quinn described the songs in the live stream as \\"a constant stream of low-key music you play in the background while you get work done, do chores, whatever you're doing at home right now.\\"  Notes   References  Category:Lo-fi musicians Category:YouTube ","title":"ChilledCow"},{"id":"65368012","text":"JDS Tachikaze (DDG-168) is the lead ship of the Tachikaze-class destroyer built for the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force (JMSDF).

Life  Herzmanovsky-Orlando was born on 30 April 1877 as Friedrich Josef Franz Ritter von Herzmanowsky (Baron Herzmanowsky) in Vienna, Austria-Hungary. he as the son of Emil Josef Ritter von Herzmanowsky, an Imperial and Royal official in the Ministry of Agriculture who came from Tarnów, and his wife, Aloisia von Orlando who had been born in Kosmonosy. He attended the private Theresianum school in Vienna before completing, in 1896–1903, a construction engineering degree at the Vienna University of Technology. Within the next year and a half he got to know his subsequent lifelong friend, Alfred Kubin, and in Munich associated with Cosmic Circle, a group of writers and intellectuals that included Karl Wolfskehl, Ludwig Klages and Alfred Schuler. In 1904/05, Herzmanovsky-Orlando worked as an employee and later as an independent architect. In 1911/12, he gave his career up due to chronically painful kidney tuberculosis. On 25 February 1911, he married Carmen Maria Schulista in Vienna. Because he was financially independent, he lived from then on as a privatier in art, drawing, collecting, restoring and writing. His disease led to several spa breaks and trips to the south. Among other things, he went with his wife in 1913 to the northeastern Adriatic, in 1914 to Egypt, Sicily and southern Italy for over four months. In 1916, due to illness, he moved to Meran which was Austrian until 1918, now Merano in Italy. From the beginning of 1918, with official permission, he also bore his maternal surname. His mother's family came from the Swiss uradel, his grandfather Friedrich von Orlando was the lord of the manor (Rittergutsbesitzer) in Kleindehsa in the German Empire. Herzmanovsky-Orlando falsified his family tree to claim ancestry even before the Crusades. In 1932, he became a member of the NSDAP/AO, foreign branch of the Nazi party.Sinfonietta, 2001 issue, p. 336 Having become a German citizen as a result of the Anschluss of Austria to the German Reich in 1938, Herzmanovsky- Orlando was forced to leave South Tyrol in 1940 under the South Tyrol Option Agreement. Since he could not live north of the Alps due to illness, he moved to Malcesine on Lake Garda. He did not return to Merano until 1949. He spent the last years of his life in the nearby Schloss Rametz, where he died of uremia on 17 May 1954.Monika von Gagern, p. 37, Herzmanovsky spent many summers in his villa in Ebensee-Rindbach, his family's holiday home. Here he received several guests, including the journalist Anni Hartmann and Hedi Juer, his half-sister who lives in Australia. In 1970, Herzmanovsky-Orlando-Gasse in Vienna - Floridsdorf (21st District) was named after him.  Work  Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando was able to publish very little during his lifetime. Many of his works are only available in sketch form. His extensive literary work, which consists mainly of prose and plays, only became known posthumously through the collected works published by Friedrich Torberg. As an editor, however, Torberg made significant changes to Herzmanovsky-Orlando's texts, which led to severe criticism from literary studies. For example, in Masquerade of Geniuses (Maskenspiel der Genien), Torberg changed the name of the \\"Empire of Tarock\\" completely arbitrarily from Tarockia (Tarockei) to Tarockania (Tarockanien), obviously based on the term Kakania (Kakanien) in Robert Musil's Man Without Qualities. Herzmanovsky-Orlando envisaged a certain harmony with Turkey or the earlier Byzantium. Only the second collected works, published by Germanists two decades later, gave a faithful rendering of the original text. In his works, Herzmanovsky-Orlando fantasized about a mystical dreamland called \\"Tarockia\\" (Tarockei), which he portrayed in an extravagant, baroque style that bordered on the parodistic. He had Italian humanist, Cyriaco de' Pizzicolli, appear as the main character of his grotesquely fantastic novel, Masquerade of Geniuses. In addition to contacts with the Munich Cosmic Circle and other, equally irrational-esoteric groups, he became involved in the esoteric and mystic, including the right-wing esoteric ideas of Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels and pseudoscience. Fritz von Herzmanovsky-Orlando was a member of the New Temple Order founded by Jörg Lanz von Liebenfels. An example of his esoteric orientation is his \\"discovery\\" that the legendary \\"saline women\\" in Tyrol, who also appear in his Tyrolean Dragon Play (Tiroler Drachenspiel), were actually yoga girls who at certain points, the so-called \\"earth navels\\" (Erdnabel), could cause gene mutations by dancing. His only known work as an architect is the house at Wehrgasse 22 in Vienna - Margareten, which he built in 1910 together with Fritz Keller.

A significant part of the cities (there were more than 900 of them by the 6th century) were founded during the period of Greek and Roman antiquity. The largest of them were Constantinople, Alexandria and Antioch, with a population of several hundred thousand people. Large provincial centers had a population of up to 50,000. Although the spread of Christianity negatively affected urban institutions, in general, late antique cities continued to develop continuously. Byzantium remained an empire of cities, although the urban space had changed a lot. If the Roman city was a place of pagan worship and sports events, theatrical performances and chariot races, the residence of officials and judges, then the Byzantine city was primarily a religious center where the bishop's residence was located.  Historical development  = From ancient city to early Byzantine = Main street paved with marble blocks in Sardis (Lydia), Turkey The first period of Byzantine history, \\"Proto-Byzantine\\" in the words of Paul Lemerle, is usually placed between the 4th and the middle of the 7th century. It is considered to be transitional, and its main characteristics can be described in the late antique socio-cultural paradigm, which was based on a polis with its inherent features. The French historian Évelyne Patlagean emphasizes the contrast between the internal stagnation of urban life and the external prosperity of the polis. However, within the vast territory of the Roman and Byzantine empires, development took place in different ways, and, for example, in Anatolia, during more than 500 years of Roman rule, the process of ruralization took place. For the first period, several fairly general trends were identified that determined the appearance of the city. First, after more than a century and a half, the construction of city walls resumed at the end of the 5th century. The previous fortification program, which began under Emperor Valerian I in the middle of the 3rd century in response to the invasions of the Goths and Heruli, ended around 330. As a rule, the early Byzantine walls of the cities of Asia Minor and the Balkans date from the reign of the emperors Anastasius I (491-518) and Justinian I (527-565), however, the absence of a real military threat in those years makes the dating unreliable. In modern works, it is suggested that the walls of a number of Asia Minor cities could have been created during the era of Theodosius dynasty (379-450), when the empire was threatened by the Goths and Huns. The Theodosian walls were impressive structures that surrounded almost entirely residential areas and were equipped with representative gates. According to one point of view, the walls marked the core of the city and served as a symbol of its status. On the contrary, the perimeter of the walls built under Justinian and his successors, as a rule, did not allow to protect the entire city.

It induces immunity through the inner surface of the nose, a surface that naturally comes in contact with many airborne microbes. Administration Administering a vaccine via the nose is painless, non- invasive and easier to perform than using a needle, which has risks of needle stick injuries and issues relating to safe disposal. Nasal vaccine technology A few different devices have become available for the nasal delivery of vaccines. Live attenuated influenza vaccine FluMist Quadrivalent Fluenz Tetra Nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV) is available under the brand name FluMist Quadrivalent in the United States and the brand name Fluenz Tetra in Europe. In addition to the antigens (active ingredient), nasal flu vaccine contains gelatin, small amounts of amino acids and sucrose, which act as stabilizers. Veterinary medicine In veterinary medicine, vaccination against Bordetella bronchiseptica, a cause of kennel cough, can be delivered by the nasal route in dogs. History Kangxi Emperor, in the 17th century, claimed that to protect his entire family and army from smallpox he had them all inoculated, a procedure described in manuals of the time as involving the technique of \\"blowing smallpox material up the nose\\" or insufflation. The material used varied from ground-up dry scabs to fluid collected from a pustule. Research Following the September 11 attacks of 2001, and the subsequent anthrax attacks, there has been an active search for vaccines that could be stored and stockpiled, including developments in a nasal vaccine for anthrax. In an experiment in 2004, a nasal vaccine was given to four African green monkeys in the search for a vaccine for SARS-CoV.
